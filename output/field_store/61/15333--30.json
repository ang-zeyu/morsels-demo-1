She heard  many remarks not intended for her far-reaching ears. An old grizzled  Westerner remarked to Hutter: \"Wall, she's shore an unbroke filly.\"  Another of the company--a woman--remarked: \"Sweet an' pretty as a  columbine. But I'd like her better if she was dressed decent.\" And a  gaunt range rider, who stood with others at the porch door, looking on,  asked a comrade: \"Do you reckon that's style back East?\" To which the  other replied: \"Mebbe, but I'd gamble they're short on silk back East  an' likewise sheriffs.\"    Carley received some meed of gratification out of the sensation she  created, but she did not carry her craving for it to the point of  overshadowing Flo. On the contrary, she contrived to have Flo share the  attention she received. She taught Flo to dance the fox-trot and got  Glenn to dance with her. Then she taught it to Lee Stanton. And when Lee  danced with Flo, to the infinite wonder and delight of the onlookers,  Carley experienced her first sincere enjoyment of the evening.    Her moment came when she danced with Glenn. It reminded her of days  long past and which she wanted to return again. Despite war tramping and  Western labors Glenn retained something of his old grace and lightness.  But just to dance with him was enough to swell her heart, and for once  she grew oblivious to the spectators.    \"Glenn, would you like to go to the Plaza with me again, and dance  between dinner courses, as we used to?\" she whispered up to him.    \"Sure I would--unless Morrison knew you were to be there,\" he replied.    \"Glenn!... I would not even see him.\"    \"Any old time you wouldn't see Morrison!\" he exclaimed, half mockingly.    His doubt, his tone grated upon her. Pressing closer to him, she said,  \"Come back and I'll prove it.\"    But he laughed and had no answer for her. At her own daring words  Carley's heart had leaped to her lips. If he had responded, even  teasingly, she could have burst out with her longing to take him back.  But silence inhibited her, and the moment passed.    At the end of that dance Hutter claimed Glenn in the interest of  neighboring sheep men. And Carley, crossing the big living room alone,  passed close to one of the porch doors. Some one, indistinct in the  shadow, spoke to her in low voice: \"Hello, pretty eyes!\"    Carley felt a little cold shock go tingling through her. But she gave no  sign that she had heard. She recognized the voice and also the epithet.  Passing to the other side of the room and joining the company there,  Carley presently took a casual glance at the door. Several men were  lounging there. One of them was the sheep dipper, Haze Ruff. His bold  eyes were on her now, and his coarse face wore a slight, meaning smile,  as if he understood something about her that was a secret to others.  Carley dropped her eyes. But she could not shake off the feeling that  wherever she moved this man's gaze followed her. The unpleasantness  of this incident would have been nothing to Carley had she at once  forgotten it. Most unaccountably, however, she could not make herself  unaware of this ruffian's attention. It did no good for her to argue  that she was merely the cynosure of all eyes. This Ruff's tone and look  possessed something heretofore unknown to Carley. Once she was tempted  to tell Glenn. But that would only cause a fight, so she kept her  counsel. She danced again, and helped Flo entertain her guests, and  passed that door often; and once stood before it, deliberately, with all  the strange and contrary impulse so inscrutable in a woman, and never  for a moment wholly lost the sense of the man's boldness. It dawned  upon her, at length, that the singular thing about this boldness was  its difference from any, which had ever before affronted her. The fool's  smile meant that he thought she saw his attention, and, understanding  it perfectly, had secret delight in it. Many and various had been the  masculine egotisms which had come under her observation. But quite  beyond Carley was this brawny sheep dipper, Haze Ruff. Once the party  broke up and the guests had departed, she instantly forgot both man and  incident.    Next day, late in the afternoon, when Carley came out on the porch, she  was hailed by Flo, who had just ridden in from down the canyon.    \"Hey Carley, come down. I shore have something to tell you,\" she called.    Carley did not use any time pattering down that rude porch stairway.  Flo was dusty and hot, and her chaps carried the unmistakable scent of  sheep-dip.    \"Been over to Ryan's camp an' shore rode hard to beat Glenn home,\"  drawled Flo.    \"Why?\" queried Carley, eagerly.    \"Reckon I wanted to tell you something Glenn swore he wouldn't let me  tell. ... He makes me tired. He thinks you can't stand things.\"    \"Oh! Has he been--hurt?\"    \"He's skinned an' bruised up some, but I reckon he's not hurt.\"    \"Flo--what happened?\" demanded Carley, anxiously.    \"Carley, do you know Glenn can fight like the devil?\" asked Flo.    \"No, I don't. But I remember he used to be athletic. Flo, you make me  nervous. Did Glenn fight?\"    \"I reckon he did,\" drawled Flo.    \"With whom?\"    \"Nobody else but that big hombre, Haze Ruff.\"    \"Oh!\" gasped Carley, with a violent start. \"That--that ruffian! Flo, did  you see--were you there?\"    \"I shore was, an' next to a horse race I like a fight,\" replied the  Western girl. \"Carley, why didn't you tell me Haze Ruff insulted you  last night?\"    \"Why, Flo--he only said, 'Hello, pretty eyes,' and I let it pass!\" said  Carley, lamely.    \"You never want to let anything pass, out West. Because next time you'll  get worse. This turn your other cheek doesn't go in Arizona. But  we shore thought Ruff said worse than that. Though from him that's  aplenty.\"    \"How did you know?\"    \"Well, Charley told it. He was standing out here by the door last night  an' he heard Ruff speak to you. Charley thinks a heap of you an' I  reckon he hates Ruff. Besides, Charley stretches things. He shore riled  Glenn, an' I want to say, my dear, you missed the best thing that's  happened since you got here.\"    \"Hurry--tell me,\" begged Carley, feeling the blood come to her face.    \"I rode over to Ryan's place for dad, an' when I got there I knew  nothing about what Ruff said to you,\" began Flo, and she took hold of  Carley's hand. \"Neither did dad. You see, Glenn hadn't got there yet.  Well, just as the men had finished dipping a bunch of sheep Glenn came  riding down, lickety cut.\"    \"'Now what the hell's wrong with Glenn?' said dad, getting up from where  we sat.    \"Shore I knew Glenn was mad, though I never before saw him that way.  He looked sort of grim an' black.... Well, he rode right down on us an'  piled off. Dad yelled at him an' so did I. But Glenn made for the sheep  pen. You know where we watched Haze Ruff an' Lorenzo slinging the sheep  into the dip. Ruff was just about to climb out over the fence when Glenn  leaped up on it.\"    \"'Say, Ruff,' he said, sort of hard, 'Charley an' Ben tell me they heard  you speak disrespectfully to Miss Burch last night.'\"    \"Dad an' I ran to the fence, but before we could catch hold of Glenn  he'd jumped down into the pen.\"    \"'I'm not carin' much for what them herders say,' replied Ruff.    \"'Do you deny it?' demanded Glenn.    \"'I ain't denyin' nothin', Kilbourne,' growled Ruff. 'I might argue  against me bein' disrespectful. That's a matter of opinion.'    \"'You'll apologize for speaking to Miss Burch or I'll beat you up an'  have Hutter fire you.'    \"'Wal, Kilbourne, I never eat my words,' replied Ruff.    \"Then Glenn knocked him flat. You ought to have heard that crack.  Sounded like Charley hitting a steer with a club. Dad yelled: 'Look out,  Glenn. He packs a gun!'--Ruff got up mad clear through I reckon. Then  they mixed it. Ruff got in some swings, but he couldn't reach Glenn's  face. An' Glenn batted him right an' left, every time in his ugly  mug. Ruff got all bloody an' he cussed something awful. Glenn beat him  against the fence an' then we all saw Ruff reach for a gun or knife. All  the men yelled. An' shore I screamed. But Glenn saw as much as we saw.  He got fiercer. He beat Ruff down to his knees an' swung on him hard.  Deliberately knocked Ruff into the dip ditch. What a splash! It wet all  of us. Ruff went out of sight. Then he rolled up like a huge hog. We  were all scared now. That dip's rank poison, you know. Reckon Ruff knew  that. He floundered along an' crawled up at the end. Anyone could  see that he had mouth an' eyes tight shut. He began to grope an' feel  around, trying to find the way to the pond. One of the men led him out.  It was great to see him wade in the water an' wallow an' souse his head  under. When he came out the men got in front of him any stopped him.  He shore looked bad.... An' Glenn called to him, 'Ruff, that sheep-dip  won't go through your tough hide, but a bullet will!\"      Not long after this incident Carley started out on her usual afternoon  ride, having arranged with Glenn to meet her on his return from work.    Toward the end of June Carley had advanced in her horsemanship to a  point where Flo lent her one of her own mustangs. This change might not  have had all to do with a wonderful difference in riding, but it seemed  so to Carley. There was as much difference in horses as in people. This  mustang she had ridden of late was of Navajo stock, but he had been born  and raised and broken at Oak Creek. Carley had not yet discovered any  objection on his part to do as she wanted him to. He liked what she  liked, and most of all he liked to go. His color resembled a pattern  of calico, and in accordance with Western ways his name was therefore  Calico. Left to choose his own gait, Calico always dropped into a gentle  pace which was so easy and comfortable and swinging that Carley never  tired of it.

If, however, thou art sailing upon the sea of creation, know thou that the  First Remembrance, which is the Primal Will of God, may be likened unto  the sun. God hath created Him through the potency of His might, and He  hath, from the beginning that hath no beginning, caused Him to be  manifested in every Dispensation through the compelling power of His  behest, and God will, to the end that knoweth no end, continue to manifest  Him according to the good-pleasure of His invincible Purpose.    And know thou that He indeed resembleth the sun. Were the risings of the  sun to continue till the end that hath no end, yet there hath not been nor  ever will be more than one sun; and were its settings to endure for  evermore, still there hath not been nor ever will be more than one sun. It  is this Primal Will which appeareth resplendent in every Prophet and  speaketh forth in every revealed Book. It knoweth no beginning, inasmuch  as the First deriveth its firstness from It; and knoweth no end, for the  Last oweth its lastness unto It.    In the time of the First Manifestation the Primal Will appeared in Adam;  in the day of Noah It became known in Noah; in the day of Abraham in Him;  and so in the day of Moses; the day of Jesus; the day of Muhammad, the  Apostle of God; the day of the 'Point of the Bayan'; the day of Him Whom  God shall make manifest; and the day of the One Who will appear after Him  Whom God shall make manifest. Hence the inner meaning of the words uttered  by the Apostle of God, 'I am all the Prophets', inasmuch as what shineth  resplendent in each one of Them hath been and will ever remain the one and  the same sun.            5: EXCERPTS FROM THE KITAB-I-ASMA (THE BOOK OF NAMES)      O ye that are invested with the Bayan! Denounce ye not one another, ere  the Day-Star of ancient eternity shineth forth above the horizon of His  sublimity. We have created you from one tree and have caused you to be as  the leaves and fruit of the same tree, that haply ye may become a source  of comfort to one another. Regard ye not others save as ye regard your own  selves, that no feeling of aversion may prevail amongst you so as to shut  you out from Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection.  It behooveth you all to be one indivisible people; thus should ye return  unto Him Whom God shall make manifest.    Those who have deprived themselves of this Resurrection by reason of their  mutual hatreds or by regarding themselves to be in the right and others in  the wrong, were chastised on the Day of Resurrection by reason of such  hatreds evinced during their night.(70) Thus they deprived themselves of  beholding the countenance of God, and this for no other reason than mutual  denunciations.    O ye that are invested with the Bayan! Ye should perform such deeds as  would please God, your Lord, earning thereby the good-pleasure of Him Whom  God shall make manifest. Turn not your religion into a means of material  gain, spending your life on vanities, and inheriting thereby on the Day of  Resurrection that which would displease Him Whom God shall make manifest,  while ye deem that what ye do is right. If, however, ye observe piety in  your Faith, God will surely nourish you from the treasuries of His  heavenly grace.    Be ye sincere in your allegiance to Him Whom God shall make manifest, for  the sake of God, your Lord, that perchance ye may, through devotion to His  Faith, be redeemed on the Day of Resurrection. Beware lest ye suffer one  another to be wrapt in veils by reason of the disputes which may, during  your night, arise among you as a result of the problems ye encounter or in  consideration of such matters as your loftiness or lowliness, your  nearness or remoteness.    Thus have We firmly exhorted you--a befitting exhortation indeed--that haply  ye may cleave tenaciously unto it and attain thereby salvation on the Day  of Resurrection. The time is approaching when ye will be at peace with  yourselves in your homes, and lo, Him Whom God shall make manifest will  have appeared, and God wisheth you to return unto Him, even as God called  you into being through the Primal Point. However, all of you will seek  guidance while pursuing the promptings of your own desires. Some of you  are filled with pride by reason of your religion, others because of your  learning. Ye will, one and all, cling unto some part of the Bayan as a  means of self-glorification. XVI, 19.(71)          \"God is sanctified from His servants and no direct relationship ...\"      God is sanctified from His servants and no direct relationship ever  existeth between Him and any created thing, while ye have all arisen at  His bidding. Verily He is your Lord and your God, your Master and your  King. He ordaineth your movements at His behest throughout the day-time  and in the night season.    Say, He Whom God shall make manifest is indeed the Primal Veil of God.  Above this Veil ye can find nothing other than God, while beneath it ye  can discern all things emanating from God. He is the Unseen, the  Inaccessible, the Most Exalted, the Best Beloved.    If ye seek God, it behooveth you to seek Him Whom God shall make manifest,  and if ye cherish the desire to dwell in the Ark of Names, ye will be  distinguished as the guides to Him Whom God shall make manifest, did ye  but believe in Him. Verily then make your hearts the daysprings of His  exalted Names as recorded in the Book, and ye shall, even as mirrors  placed before the sun, be able to receive enlightenment. XVI, 17.          \"Should a person lay claim to a cause and produce his ...\"      Should a person lay claim to a cause and produce his proofs, then those  who seek to repudiate him are required to produce proofs like unto his. If  they succeed in doing so, his words will prove vain and they will prevail;  otherwise neither his words will cease nor the proofs he hath set forth  will become void. I admonish you, O ye who are invested with the Bayan, if  ye would fain assert your ascendancy, confront not any soul unless ye give  proofs similar to that which he hath adduced; for Truth shall be firmly  established, while aught else besides it is sure to perish.    How numerous the people who engaged in contests with Muhammad, the Apostle  of God, and were eventually reduced to naught, inasmuch as they were  powerless to bring forth proofs similar to that which God had sent down  unto Him. Had they been abashed and modest, and had they realized the  nature of the proofs wherewith He was invested, they would never have  challenged Him. But they regarded themselves as champions of their own  religion. Therefore God laid hold on them according to their deserts and  vindicated the Truth through the power of Truth. This is what ye clearly  perceive today in the Muhammadan Revelation.    Who is the man amongst you who can challenge the exalted Thrones of  Reality in every Dispensation, while all existence is wholly dependent  upon Them? Indeed, God hath wiped out all those who have opposed Them from  the beginning that hath no beginning until the present day and hath  conclusively demonstrated the Truth through the power of Truth. Verily, He  is the Almighty, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. XVII, 11.          \"O Ye who are invested with the Bayan! Be ye watchful ...\"      O Ye who are invested with the Bayan! Be ye watchful on the Day of  Resurrection, for on that Day ye will firmly believe in the Vahid of the  Bayan, though this, even as your past religion which proved of no avail,  can in no wise benefit you, unless ye embrace the Cause of Him Whom God  shall make manifest and believe in that which He ordaineth. Therefore take  ye good heed lest ye shut yourselves out from Him Who is the Fountain-head  of all Messengers and Scriptures, while ye hold fast to parts of the  teachings which have emanated from these sources. XVII, 15.          \"Consider how at the time of the appearance of every ...\"      Consider how at the time of the appearance of every Revelation, those who  open their hearts to the Author of that Revelation recognize the Truth,  while the hearts of those who fail to apprehend the Truth are straitened  by reason of their shutting themselves out from Him. However, openness of  heart is bestowed by God upon both parties alike. God desireth not to  straiten the heart of anyone, be it even an ant, how much less the heart  of a superior creature, except when he suffereth himself to be wrapt in  veils, for God is the Creator of all things.    Wert thou to open the heart of a single soul by helping him to embrace the  Cause of Him Whom God shall make manifest, thine inmost being would be  filled with the inspirations of that august Name. It devolveth upon you,  therefore, to perform this task in the Days of Resurrection, inasmuch as  most people are helpless, and wert thou to open their hearts and dispel  their doubts, they would gain admittance into the Faith of God. Therefore,  manifest thou this attribute to the utmost of thine ability in the days of  Him Whom God shall make manifest. For indeed if thou dost open the heart  of a person for His sake, better will it be for thee than every virtuous  deed; since deeds are secondary to faith in Him and certitude in His  Reality. XVII, 15.          \"Take heed to carefully consider the words of every soul, ...\"      Take heed to carefully consider the words of every soul, then hold fast to  the proofs which attest the truth. If ye fail to discover truth in a  person's words, make them not the object of contention, inasmuch as ye  have been forbidden in the Bayan to enter into idle disputation and  controversy, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may not engage  in argumentation, and dispute with Him Whom God shall make manifest.
