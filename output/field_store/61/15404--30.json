Here was the precinct containing           two temples of Dionysus, in the older of which was the           xoanon[132] brought from Eleutherae by Pegasus. That in early           times, at least, all dramatic contests were not held here we           have strong assurance. Pausanias[133] the lexicographer,           mentions the wooden seats in the agora from which the people           viewed the dramatic contests before the theatre [Greek: en           Dionysou] was constructed--plainly the existing theatre.           Hesychius confirms this testimony.[134]             [Footnote 132: PAUS I. 2, 5 and I. 20, 3.]             [Footnote 133: PAUS., _Lexikoq._ [Greek: ikria ta, te agora,           aph' ôn etheônto tous Dionysiakous agyna prin e cataskeuasthenai           to en Dionysou Theatron.] Cf. EUSTATH. _Comment. Hom._ 1472.]             [Footnote 134: HESYCH, [Greek: ap' aigeirôn].]             Bekker's _Anecdota_ include mention, also,[135] of the wooden           seats of this temporary theatre. Pollux adds[136] his testimony           that the wooden seats were in the agora. Photius gives the           further important information that the orchestra first received           its name in the agora.[137] There can be no doubt that in very           early times, there were dramatic representations in the agora           in honor of Dionysus; and there must therefore have been a           shrine or a precinct of the god in or close to the agora. The           possibility of presentation of dramas at Athens, especially in           these early times, unconnected with the worship of Dionysus and           with some shrine sacred to him, cannot be entertained for a  Page 64  moment. It is commonly accepted that dramas were represented           during two festivals in Athens,--at the contest at the Lenaeum           and at the City Dionysia. The plays of the latter festival were           undoubtedly given in the extant theatre; but of the former           contest we have an entirely different record. Harpocration           say[138] merely that the Limnae were a locality in Athens where           Dionysus was honored. A reference in Bekker's _Anecdota_           is[139] more explicit. Here the Lenaeum is described as a place           sacred to [Greek: (ieron)] Dionysus where the contests were           established before the building of the theatre. In the           Etymologicum Magnum[140] the Lenaeum is said to be an enclosure           [Greek: (periaulos)] in which is a sanctuary of Dionysus Lenaeus.           Photius declares[141] that the Lenaeum is a large peribolus in           which were held the so-called contests at the Lenaeum before the           theatre was built, and that in this peribolus there was the           sanctuary of Dionysus Lenaeus. The scholiast to Aristophanes'           _Frogs_ says[142] that the Limnae were a locality sacred to           Dionysus, and that a temple and another building [Greek: (oikos)]           of the god stood therein. Hesychius mentions[143] the Limnae as           a locality where the Lenaea were held, and says that the Lenaeum           was a large peribolus within the city, in which was the           sanctuary of Dionysus Lenaeus, and that the Athenians held           contests in this peribolos before they built the theatre.           Pollux speaks[144] of the two theatres, [Greek: kai Dionysiakon           theatron kai lenaicon]. Stephanus of Byzantium quotes[145] from           Apollodorus that the \"Lenaion Agon\" is a contest in the fields           by the wine-press. Plato implies[146] the existence of a second           theatre by stating that Pherecrates exhibited dramas at the           Lenaeum. If the Lenaea and the City Dionysia were held in the           same locality, it is peculiar that in all the passages           concerning the Lenaeum and the Limnae we find no mention of the           Greater Dionysia. But our list of authorities goes still  Page 65  further. Aristophanes speaks[147] of the contest [Greek: kat           agrous]. The scholiast declares that he refers to the Lenaea,           that the Lenaeum was a place sacred [Greek (ieron)] to Dionysus,           [Greek: en agrous] and that the word [Greek: Lenaion] came from           the fact that here first stood the [Greek: lenos] or wine-press.           He adds[148] that the contests in honor of Dionysus took place           twice in the year, first in the city in the spring, and the           second time [Greek: en agrois] at the Lenaeum in the winter. The           precinct by the present theatre, as we know, was sacred to           Dionysus Eleuthereus. In this temenus no mention has been found           of Dionysus [Greek: Limnaios] or [Greek: Lenaios].

BYZ., [Greek: Lenaios].]             [Footnote 146: PLATO, _Protag._, 327 w.]             [Footnote 147: _Achar._, 202, and schol.]             [Footnote 148: _Schol. Aristoph. Achar._, 504.]             Demosthenes tells us[149] that the Athenians, having inscribed           a certain law (concerning the festivals of Dionysus) on a stone           stele, set this up in the sanctuary of Dionysus [Greek: en           Limnais], beside the altar. \"This stele was set up,\" he           continues, in the most ancient and most sacred precinct[150] of           Dionysus, so that but few should see what had been written; for           the precinct is opened only once every year, on the 12th of the           month Anthesterio.             [Footnote 149: _Near._ 76.]             [Footnote 150: I have translated [Greek: ierô] by precinct. This           is liable to the objection that [Greek: ieron] may also mean           temple; and [Greek: anoigetai] \"is opened\" of the passage may           naturally be applied to the opening of a temple. But \"hieron\"           often refers to a sacred precinct, and there is nothing to           prevent the verb in question from being used of a \"hieron\" in           this sense. If we consult the passages in which this particular           precinct is mentioned we find, in those quoted from Photius and           the _Etymologicum Magnum_, that the Lenaeum contains a hieron of           the Lenaean Dionysus. This might be either temple or precinct.           In the citation from Bekker's _Anecdota_ the Lenaeum is the           hieron at which were held the theatrical contests. This implies           that the hieron was a precinct of some size. The Scholiast to           _Achar._ 202 makes the Lenaeum the hieron of the Lenaean           Dionysus. Here \"hieron\" is certainly a precinct. Hesych. [Greek:           epi Lenaiô agôn] renders this still more distinct by saying that           the Lenaeum contained the hieron of the Lenaean Dionysus, in           which the theatrical contests were held. But Demosthenes in the           _Neaera_ declares that the decree was engraved on a stone           stele. It was the custom to set up such inscriptions in the           open air. This stele was also beside the altar. There were           indeed often altars in the Greek temple, but the chief altar           (bômos of the passage) was in the open air. Furthermore, if the           decree had been placed in the small temple, the designation           \"alongside the altar\" would have been superfluous. But in the           larger precinct such a particular location was necessary. Nor           can it be urged, in view of the secret rites in connection with           the marriage of the King Archon's wife to Dionysus on the 12th           of Anthesterio, that hieron must mean temple; since the new           Aristotle manuscript tells us that this ceremony took place in           the Bucoleum.]             The stele being then visible to the public on but one day of           the year it follows that the entire precinct of Dionysus [Greek:  Page 66  en Limnais] must have been closed during the remainder of the           year. This could not be unless we grant that, in the time of           Demosthenes at least, the Lenaea and the Megala Dionysia were           held in different precincts, and that the Lenaea and           Anthesteria were one and the same festival.             Pausanias tells us[151] that the xoanon brought from Eleutherae           was in one of the two temples in the theatre-precinct, while           the other contained the chryselephantine statue of Alcamenes.           We know, both from the method of construction and from literary           notices, that these two temples were in existence in the time           of Demosthenes. Pausanias says[152] that on fixed days every           year, the statue of the god was borne to a little temple of           Dionysus near the Academy. Pausanias' use of the plural in           [Greek: tetagmenais emerais] is excellent authority that the           temple of the xoanon was opened at least on more than one day of           every year.             From all these considerations it seems to be impossible that           the precinct of the older temple by the extant theatre and the           sanctuary [Greek: en Limnais] could be the same. The suggestion           that the gold and ivory statue of Alcamenes could have been the           one borne in procession at the time of the Greater Dionysia is,           of course, untenable from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2016"],[0,"The 1998 CIA World Factbook (#20)"],[1,"te: 81.64 deaths/1,000 live births (1998 est.)

It  resembles the Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim  population, high structural unemployment, and low standard of living.  The economy's most prominent products are oil, cotton, and gas.  Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for  several years, but the negotiation of more than a dozen  production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with foreign firms, which have  thus far committed $30 billion to oil field development, should  generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development. Oil  production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan  International Operating Company, began in November 1997. Azerbaijan  shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet republics in  making the transition from a command to a market economy, but its  considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Baku  has only recently begun making progress on economic reform, and old  economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. A major  short-term obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign  investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the ethnic  Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Trade with Russia and  the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while  trade is building up with the nations of Europe, Turkey, Iran, and the  UAE. A serious long-term challenge is the maintenance of the  competitiveness of non-oil exports in world markets.    GDP: purchasing power parity-$11.9 billion (1997 est.)
