It was not so, however, and the same writers who have given us such a  lamentable picture of the condition of the workmen in the towns, have  painted for us in even darker colours the miseries which overwhelmed the  country people. \"Dost thou not recall the picture of the farmer, when  the tenth of his grain is levied? Worms have destroyed half of the  wheat, and the hippopotami have eaten the rest; there are swarms of rats  in the fields, the grasshoppers alight there, the cattle devour, the  little birds pilfer, and if the farmer lose sight for an instant of  what remains upon the ground, it is carried off by robbers;* the thongs,  moreover, which bind the iron and the hoe are worn out, and the team has  died at the plough. It is then that the scribe steps out of the boat at  the landing-place to levy the tithe, and there come the keepers of  the doors of the granary with cudgels and the negroes with ribs of  palm-leaves, who come crying: 'Come now, corn!' There is none, and they  throw the cultivator full length upon the ground; bound, dragged to the  canal, they fling him in head first;** his wife is bound with him, his  children are put into chains; the neighbours, in the mean time, leave  him and fly to save their grain.\"         * This last danger survives even to the present day. During       part of the year the fellahin spend the night in their       fields; if they did not see to it, their neighbours would       not hesitate to come and cut their wheat before the harvest,       or root up their vegetables while still immature.         ** The same kind of torture is mentioned in the decree of       Harmhabi, in which the lawless soldiery are represented as       \"running from house to house, dealing blows right and left       with their sticks, ducking the fellahin head downwards in       the water, and not leaving one of them with a whole skin.\"       This treatment was still resorted to in Egypt not long ago,       in order to extract money from those taxpayers whom beatings       had failed to bring to reason.    One might be tempted to declare that the picture is too dark a one to be  true, did one not know from other sources of the brutal ways of filling  the treasury which Egypt has retained even to the present day. In the  same way as in the town, the stick facilitated the operations of the  tax-collector in the country: it quickly opened the granaries of the  rich, it revealed resources to the poor of which he had been ignorant,  and it only failed in the case of those who had really nothing to give.  Those who were insolvent were not let off even when they had been more  than half killed: they and their families were sent to prison, and they  had to work out in forced labour the amount which they had failed to pay  in current merchandise.*         * This is evident from a passage in the _Sallier Papyrus n deg.       I_, quoted above, in which we see the taxpayer in fetters,       dragged out to clean the canals, his whole family, wife and       children, accompanying him in bonds.    [Illustration: 130.jpg LEVYING THE TAX: THE TAXPAYER IN THE HANDS OF THE  EXACTORS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a picture on the tomb of Khiti       at Beni-Hasan (cf. Champollion, _Monuments de l'Egypte_, pl.       cccxc. 4; Rosellini, _Monumenti civili_, pl. cxxiv. b).    The collection of the taxes was usually terminated by a rapid revision  of the survey. The scribe once more recorded the dimensions and  character of the domain lands in order to determine afresh the amount  of the tax which should be imposed upon them. It often happened, indeed,  that, owing to some freak of the Nile, a tract of ground which had been  fertile enough the preceding year would be buried under a gravel bed, or  transformed into a marsh. The owners who thus suffered were allowed an  equivalent deduction; as for the farmers, no deductions of the burden  were permitted in their case, but a tract equalling in value that of the  part they had lost was granted to them out of the royal or seignorial  domain, and their property was thus made up to its original worth.    [Illustration: 131.jpg LEVYING THE TAX: THE BASTINADO]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a picture on the tomb of Khiti       at Beni-Hasan.    What the collection of the taxes had begun was almost always brought  to a climax by the _corvees_. However numerous the royal and seignorial  slaves might have been, they were insufficient for the cultivation of  all the lands of the domains, and a part of Egypt must always have lain  fallow, had not the number of workers been augmented by the addition of  those who were in the position of freemen.    This excess of cultivable land was subdivided into portions of equal  dimensions, which were distributed among the inhabitants of neighbouring  villages by the officers of a \"regent\" nominated for that purpose. Those  dispensed from agricultural service were--the destitute, soldiers on  service and their families, certain _employes_ of the public works, and  servitors of the temple;* all other country-folk without exception  had to submit to it, and one or more portions were allotted to each,  according to his capabilities.** Orders issued at fixed periods called  them together, themselves, their servants and their beasts of burden, to  dig, sow, keep watch in the fields while the harvest was proceeding, to  cut and carry the crops, the whole work being done at their own expense  and to the detriment of their own interests.***         * That the scribes, i.e. the employes of the royal or       princely government, were exempt from enforced labour, is       manifest from the contrast drawn by the letter-writers of       the Sallier and Anastasi Papyri between themselves and the       peasants, or persons belonging to other professions who were       liable to it. The circular of Dorion defines the classes of       soldiers who were either temporarily or permanently exempt       under the Greek kings.         ** Several fragments of the Turin papyri contain memoranda       of enforced labour performed on behalf of the temples, and       of lists of persons liable to be called on for such labour.         *** All these details are set forth in the Ptolemaic period,       in the letter to Dorion which refers to a royal edict. As       Signor Lumbroso has well remarked, the Ptolemies merely       copied exactly the misdeeds of the old native governments.       Indeed, we come across frequent allusions to the enforced       labour of men and beasts in inscriptions of the Middle       Empire at Beni-Hasan or at Siut; many of the pictures on the       Memphite tombs show bands of such labourers at work in the       fields of the great landowners or of the king.    [Illustration: 132.jpg COLLOSAL STATUE OF A KING]    As a sort of indemnity, a few allotments were left uncultivated for  their benefit; to these they sent their flocks after the subsidence of  the inundation, for the pasturage on them was so rich that the sheep  were doubly productive in wool and offspring. This was a mere apology  for a wage: the forced labour for the irrigation brought them no  compensation. The dykes which separate the basins, and the network  of canals for distributing the water and irrigating the land, demand  continual attention: every year some need strengthening, others  re-excavating or cleaning out. The men employed in this work pass whole  days standing in the water, scraping up the mud with both hands in order  to fill the baskets of platted leaves, which boys and girls lift on to  their heads and carry to the top of the bank: the semi-liquid contents  ooze through the basket, trickle over their faces and soon coat their  bodies with a black shining mess, disgusting even to look at. Sheikhs  preside over the work, and urge it on with abuse and blows. When the  gangs of workmen had toiled all day, with only an interval of two hours  about noon for a siesta and a meagre pittance of food, the poor wretches  slept on the spot, in the open air, huddled one against another and but  ill protected by their rags from the chilly nights. The task was so hard  a one, that malefactors, bankrupts, and prisoners of war were condemned  to it; it wore out so many hands that the free peasantry were scarcely  ever exempt. Having returned to their homes, they were not called until  the next year to any established or periodic _corvee_, but many an  irregular one came and surprised them in the midst of their work, and  forced them to abandon all else to attend to the affairs of king or  lord. Was a new chamber to be added to some neighbouring temple, were  materials wanted to strengthen or rebuild some piece of wall which had  been undermined by the inundation, orders were issued to the engineers  to go and fetch a stated quantity of limestone or sandstone, and the  peasants were commanded to assemble at the nearest quarry to cut  the blocks from it, and if needful to ship and convey them to their  destination. Or perhaps the sovereign had caused a gigantic statue of  himself to be carved, and a few hundred men were requisitioned to haul  it to the place where he wished it to be set up. The undertaking ended  in a gala, and doubtless in a distribution of food and drink: the  unfortunate creatures who had been got together to execute the work  could not always have felt fitly compensated for the precious time they  had lost, by one day of drunkenness and rejoicing.    [Illustration: 136.jpg COLORED SCULPTURES IN THE PALACE]    We may ask if all these corvees were equally legal? Even if some of them  were illegal, the peasant on whom they fell could not have found the  means to escape from them, nor could he have demanded legal reparation  for the injury which they caused him.

The methods of       procedure were exactly the same as those used under the       earliest king known, as has been proved by the examination       of the bricks taken from the monuments of Uru and Lagash.         ** This method of building was noticed by classical writers.       The word \"Bowarieh,\" borne by several ancient mounds in       Chaldoa, signifies, properly speaking, a mat of reeds; it is       applied only to such buildings as are apparently constructed       with alternate layers of brick and dried reeds. The       proportion of these layers differs in certain localities: in       the ruins of the ancient temple of Belos at Babylon, now       called the \"Mujelibeh,\" the lines of straw and reeds run       uninterruptedly between each course of bricks; in the ruins       of Akkerkuf, they only occur at wider intervals--according       to Niebuhr and Ives, every seventh or eighth course;       according to Raymond, every seventh course, or sometimes       every fifth or sixth course, but in these cases the layer of       reeds becomes 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 inches wide. H. Rawlin-son       thinks, on the other hand, that all the monuments in which       we find layers of straw and reeds between the brick courses       belong to the Parthian period.    [Illustration: 128.jpg A CHALDAEAN STAMPED BRICK.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a brick preserved in the       Louvre. The bricks bearing historical inscriptions, which       are sometimes met with, appear to have been mostly ex-voto       offerings placed somewhere prominently, and not building       materials hidden in the masonry.      Monuments constructed of such a plastic material required constant  attention and frequent repairs, to keep them in good condition: after a  few years of neglect they became quite disfigured, the houses suffered  a partial dissolution in every storm, the streets were covered with  a coating of fine mud, and the general outline of the buildings and  habitations grew blurred and defaced. Whilst in Egypt the main features  of the towns are still traceable above ground, and are so well preserved  in places that, while excavating them, we are carried away from  the present into the world of the past, the Chaldaean cities, on the  contrary, are so overthrown and seem to have returned so thoroughly to  the dust from which their founders raised them, that the most patient  research and the most enlightened imagination can only imperfectly  reconstitute their arrangement.    The towns were not enclosed within those square or rectangular  enclosures with which the engineers of the Pharaohs fortified their  strongholds. The ground-plan of Uru was an oval, that of Larsam formed  almost a circle upon the soil, while Uruk and Eridu resembled in shape  a sort of irregular trapezium. The curtain of the citadel looked down on  the plain from a great height, so that the defenders were almost out  of reach of the arrows or slings of the besiegers: the remains of the  ramparts at Uruk at the present day are still forty to fifty feet  high, and twenty or more feet in thickness at the top. Narrow turrets  projected at intervals of every fifty feet along the face of the wall:  the excavations have not been sufficiently pursued to permit of our  seeing what system of defence was applied to the entrances. The area  described by these cities was often very large, but the population  in them was distributed very unequally; the temples in the different  quarters formed centres around which were clustered the dwellings of the  inhabitants, sometimes densely packed, and elsewhere thinly scattered.  The largest and richest of these temples was usually reserved for the  principal deity, whose edifices were being continually decorated by  the ruling princes, and the extent of whose ruins still attracts the  traveller. The walls, constructed and repaired with bricks stamped  with the names of lords of the locality, contain in themselves alone an  almost complete history. Did Urbau, we may ask, found the ziggurat of  Nannar in Uru? We meet with his bricks at the base of the most ancient  portions of the building, and we moreover learn, from cylinders  unearthed not far from it, that \"for Nannar, the powerful bull of Anu,  the son of Bel, his King, Urbau, the brave hero, King of Uru, had built  E-Timila, his favourite temple.\" The bricks of his son Dungi are found  mixed with his own, while here and there other bricks belonging to  subsequent kings, with cylinders, cones, and minor objects, strewn  between the courses, mark restorations at various later periods. What  is true of one Chaldaean city is equally true of all of them, and the  dynasties of Uruk and of Lagash, like those of Uru, can be reconstructed  from the revelations of their brickwork. The lords of heaven promised  to the lords of the earth, as a reward of their piety, both glory and  wealth in this life, and an eternal fame after death: they have, indeed,  kept their word. The majority of the earliest Chaldaean heroes would be  unknown to us, were it not for the witness of the ruined sanctuaries  which they built, and that which they did in the service of their  heavenly patrons has alone preserved their names from oblivion. Their  most extravagant devotion, however, cost them less money and effort than  that of the Pharaohs their contemporaries. While the latter had to  bring from a distance, even from the remotest parts of the desert, the  different kinds of stone which they considered worthy to form part of  the decoration of the houses of their gods, the Chaldaean kings gathered  up outside their very doors the principal material for their buildings:  should they require any other accessories, they could obtain, at  the worst, hard stone for their statues and thresholds in Magan and  Milukhkha, and beams of cedar and cypress in the forests of the Amanus  and the Upper Tigris. Under these conditions a temple was soon erected,  and its construction did not demand centuries of continuous labour, like  the great limestone and granite sanctuaries of Egypt: the same ruler who  laid the first brick, almost always placed the final one, and succeeding  generations had only to keep the building in ordinary repair, without  altering its original plan. The work of construction was in almost  every case carried out all at one time, designed and finished from  the drawings of one architect, and bears traces but rarely of those  deviations from the earlier plans which sometimes make the comprehension  of the Theban temples so difficult a matter: if the state of decay of  certain parts, or more often inadequate excavation, frequently prevent  us from appreciating their details, we can at least reinstate their  general outline with tolerable accuracy.    While the Egyptian temple was spread superficially over a large area,  the Chalaean temple strove to attain as high an elevation as possible.  The \"ziggurats,\" whose angular profile is a special characteristic of  the landscapes of the Euphrates, were composed of several immense cubes,  piled up on one another, and diminishing in size up to the small shrine  by which they were crowned and wherein the god himself was supposed to  dwell. There are two principal types of these ziggurats. In the first,  for which the builders of Lower Chaldaea showed a marked preference,  the vertical axis, common to all the superimposed stories, did not pass  through the centre of the rectangle which served as the base of the  whole building; it was carried back and placed near to one of the narrow  ends of the base, so that the back elevation of the temple rose abruptly  in steep narrow ledges above the plain, while the terraces of the front  broadened out into wide platforms. The stories are composed of solid  blocks of crude brick; up to the present, at least, no traces of  internal chambers have been found.* The chapel on the summit could not  contain more than one apartment: an altar stood before the door, and  access to it was obtained by a straight external staircase, interrupted  at each terrace by a more or less spacious landing.** The second type  of temple frequently found in Northern Chaldaea was represented by a  building on a square base with seven stories, all of equal height,  connected by one or two lateral staircases, having on the summit, the  pavilion of the god; this is the \"terraced tower\" which excited the  admiration of the Greeks at Babylon, and of which the temple of Bel was  the most remarkable example. The ruins of it still exist, but it has  been so frequently and so completely restored in the course of ages,  that it is impossible to say how much now remains of the original  construction. We know of several examples, however, of the other type  of ziggurat--one at Uru, another at Bridu, a third at Uruk, without  mentioning those which have not as yet been methodically explored. None  of them rises directly from the surface of the ground, but they are all  built on a raised platform, which consequently places the foundations of  the"]]]
