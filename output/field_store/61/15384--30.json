I know not where my Third Son is. What shall I do?\"    Without looking at the Sultan the Dervish answered in his sing-song  voice:    \"Send her the son for whom the Nightingale sings.\"    The Sultan turned away in disappointment, not understanding what the  Dervish meant, but one of his attendants plucked his sleeve and  whispered:    \"The Nightingale sings for yonder beggar youth. Perhaps it is he the  Dervish means. Why not ask him if he will go to Flower o' the World in  place of your Youngest Son?\"    [Illustration: _The Flower o' the World Asleep_]    The Sultan nodded, so the attendant called the beggar youth and the  Sultan asked him would he go to the Warrior Princess as the Youngest  Prince.    \"Allah alone knows where my Youngest Son is,\" the Sultan said, \"but he  is just about your age and if you were washed and anointed and dressed  in fitting garments you would not be unlike him.\"    The beggar youth said he would go but he insisted on going just as he  was. The Sultan begged him to go dressed as a prince or the Flower o'  the World might not receive him.    \"No,\" said the youth, \"I shall go as a beggar or not at all. It is for  the Flower o' the World to know me whether or not I am the Sultan's  Youngest Son and the man who stole from her the Nightingale Gisar.\"    So he went as he was to the tent of the Flower o' the World and her  warriors when they saw him coming said to the Princess:    \"This Sultan mocks you and sends you a beggar when you demand his Third  Son.\"    But the Flower o' the World ordered them all out and bade the beggar  enter alone. She looked at him long and steadily and she saw through his  rags that he was indeed a noble youth with a body made strong and  beautiful through exercise and toil and she thought to herself:    \"It were not a hard fate to marry this youth!\"    Then she questioned him:    \"Are you the Sultan's Third Son?\"    \"I am.\"    \"Then why are you dressed as a beggar?\"    \"Because I was set upon at the crossroads and beaten insensible and my  clothes torn to rags. I was coming home with the Nightingale Gisar in my  hands and I lay down at the roadside to rest while I awaited the coming  of my brothers. When I awoke to consciousness the Nightingale and its  golden cage were gone. I came home to my father's city as a beggar and  there they told me that my brothers had come just before me bringing  with them the Nightingale and boasting of the perils they had been  through and the dangers they had faced. But the Nightingale, they told  me, hanging in its golden cage beside the fountain, was silent. Yet when  I went to the mosque it always sang.\"    The Warrior Princess looked deep into his eyes and knew that he was  speaking truth. Her heart was touched with compassion at the wrong he  had suffered from his brothers, but she hid her feelings and questioned  him further.    \"Then it was you,\" she said, \"who really took from me my glorious  Nightingale Gisar?\"    \"Yes, Princess, it was. I crept past the lion and the wolf and the tiger  just after midnight while they slept. I blew out the four candles at the  head of your bed and lighted those at the foot. The golden cage of the  Nightingale was hanging from a golden chain. Before I unfastened it I  looked at you once, as you lay sleeping, and dared not look a second  time.\"    \"Why not?\" the Princess asked.    \"Because, O Flower o' the World, you were so beautiful that I feared,  were I to look again, I should forget the Nightingale Gisar and cry out  in ecstacy.\"    Then the compassion in the Princess's heart changed to love and she knew  for a certainty that this was the man she was fated to wed.    She clapped her hands and when the guards came in she said to them:    \"Call my warriors together that I may show them the Sultan's Youngest  Son and the man who stole from me my glorious Nightingale Gisar and whom  I am fated to wed.\"    So the warriors came in until they crowded the tent to its utmost. Then  the Princess stood up and took the Sultan's Youngest Son by the hand and  presented him to the warriors and told them of his great bravery and  courage and of all the perils he had endured in order to get the  Nightingale Gisar for his father's mosque.    \"He came to me now as a beggar,\" she said, \"but I knew him at once for  truth was in his mouth and courage in his eye. Behold, O warriors, your  future lord!\"    Then the warriors waved their swords and cried:    \"Long live the Flower o' the World! Long live the Sultan's Youngest  Son!\"    All the Princess's army when they heard the news raised such a mighty  shout that the people in the Sultan's city heard and were filled with  dread not knowing what it meant. But soon they knew and then they, too,  went mad with joy that what had threatened to be a war was turning to a  wedding!    The Flower o' the World and her chief warriors and with them the  Youngest Prince rode slowly to the city. The Prince was now dressed as  befitted his rank and the Sultan when he saw him recognized him at once.    \"Allah be praised!\" he cried, \"my Youngest Son lives!\"    Then they told him all--how it was this Prince and not the older  brothers who had found the Nightingale Gisar and how the older brothers  had robbed him of his prize and beaten him insensible.    When the Sultan heard how wicked his older sons had been his grief for  their death was assuaged.    \"Allah be praised,\" he said, \"that I have at least one son who is  worthy!\"    After the betrothal ceremony the Sultan and the Youngest Prince went to  the mosque to pray. While they prayed the Nightingale sang so gloriously  that it seemed to them they were no longer on earth but in Paradise.    When their prayers were finished and they were passing out, the Dervish  raised his sing-song voice and said:    \"Now indeed is the Sultan's Mosque the most beautiful Mosque in the  World for the Nightingale Gisar sings beside the Fountain!\"    [Illustration]          THE GIRL IN THE CHEST    [Illustration]    _The Story of the Third Sister Who Was Brave and Good_          THE GIRL IN THE CHEST      There was once a horrible Vampire who took the form of a handsome young  man and went to the house of an old woman who had three daughters and  pretended he wanted to marry the oldest.    \"I live far from here,\" the Vampire said. \"I own my own farm and am  well-to-do and in marrying me your daughter would get a desirable  husband. Indeed, I am so well off that I don't have to ask any dowry.\"    Now the old woman was so poor that she couldn't have given a penny of  dowry. That was the only reason why all three of her daughters hadn't  long ago been married to youths of their own village. So when the  stranger said he would require no dowry, the old woman whispered to her  oldest daughter:    \"He seems to be all right. Perhaps you had better take him.\"    The poor girl accepted her mother's advice and that afternoon started  off with the Vampire who said he would lead her home and marry her.    They walked a great distance and as evening came on they reached a wild  ghostly spot which frightened the girl half to death.    \"This way, my dear,\" the Vampire said, pushing her into an opening in  the earth. \"We take this underground passage and soon we'll be home.\"    The passage led to a sort of cave which really was the Vampire's home.    \"What an awful place!\" the poor girl cried in terror. \"Let me out!\"    \"Let you out, indeed!\" the Vampire sneered, taking his own horrible  shape and laughing cruelly. \"Here you are and here you stay and if you  don't do everything I tell you, I'll soon finish you! Here now, drink  this.\"    He offered the poor girl a pitcher and when she saw what was in it she  nearly fainted with horror.    \"No!\" she cried. \"I won't! I won't!\"    \"If you don't drink this,\" the Vampire said, darkly, \"then I'll drink  you!\"    And with that he killed her with no more feeling than if she were a fly.    Then in a short time he went back to the old woman and said:    \"Dear mother, my poor wife is ill and she begs that you send her your  second daughter to nurse her. She asks for her sister night and day and  I fear she will die unless she sees her.\"    When the poor old mother heard this, she begged the second daughter to  go at once with the young man and nurse her sick sister.    Well, the same thing happened to the second sister and in no time at all  the Vampire had killed her, too, to satisfy his awful thirst.    Then he returned again to the old mother and this time he pretended that  both sisters were sick and were trying for the third sister to come and  nurse them. So the poor old woman sent her Youngest Daughter away with  the Vampire.    The Youngest Sister when she found out the truth about the horrid  Vampire didn't sit down and weep helplessly as the others had done and  wait for the Vampire to kill her, but she prayed God's help and then  tried to find some way of escape.    There were doors in the cave which the Vampire told her were doors to  closets she must not enter. When the Vampire was out she opened these  doors and found that they all led into long underground passages.    \"This is my one chance to get back to earth!\" the girl thought and  commending her undertaking to God she fled down one of the passages.    You may be sure the Vampire when he came back and found her gone fell  into a great rage. He went running wildly up and down the various  passages and lost so much time searching the wrong passages that the  girl was able to make good her escape and reach the upper world in  safety.    She came out in a wood with no sign of human habitation anywhere in  sight.    \"What shall I do now?\" she thought. \"If I stay here alone and  unprotected some wild beast or evil creature may get me.\"    So she knelt down and prayed God to give her a chest that she could lock  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19714"],[0,"With Frederick the Great: A Story of the Seven Years' War (#20)"],[1,"half a mile  from the fortress, he took this out in order to be able to proceed  the more rapidly. He had taken particular notice of the country  from his prison window and, when he came down into a broad road  running along the valley, he turned at once to the south.    His plans had all been carefully thought out, while in prison. He  knew perfectly well that, without money, it would be altogether  impossible for him to traverse the many hundred miles that lay  between him and Saxony. There would be a hot pursuit when, in the  morning, he was found to have gone; but it would hardly be  suspected that he had taken the road for Vienna, as this would be  entirely out of his way.    Happily, he was not altogether penniless. He had always carried  five or six gold pieces, sewn up in the lining of his jacket with  the letters with which he had been furnished by Count Eulenfurst,  as a resource in case of being taken prisoner. He wished now that  he had brought more, but he thought that it might prove sufficient  for his first needs.    He walked all night. His candle burnt out, in two hours after  starting; but at eleven the moon rose, and its light enabled him to  keep the road without difficulty. As morning dawned, he approached  a good-sized village some forty miles from his starting point and,  waiting for an hour until he saw people stirring, Fergus went to  the posting house and shouted for the postmaster. The sight of a  field officer, on foot at such an hour of the morning, greatly  surprised the man when he came down.    \"My horse has fallen and broken its neck,\" Fergus said, \"and I have  had to walk some miles on foot. I have important despatches to  carry to Vienna. Bring round a horse, without a moment's delay.\"    The postmaster, without the smallest hesitation, ordered his men to  saddle and bring out a horse.    \"It will be sent back from the next stage,\" Fergus said, as he  mounted and rode on at full speed.    He changed horses twice, not the slightest suspicion being  entertained by any of the postmasters that he was not what he  seemed; and, before noon, arrived at the last post house before  reaching Vienna.    \"A bottle of your best wine, landlord, and I want to speak a word  with you in a private room. Bring two glasses.\"    The wine was poured out, and after he had drank a glass Fergus  said:    \"Landlord, I am the bearer of important despatches, and it is  imperative that I should not attract attention as I enter the city.  If I were seen and recognized there, questions might be asked, and  curiosity excited as to the news of which I am the bearer.    \"I see that you are a sensible man, and will readily understand the  situation. To avoid attracting attention, it would be best for me  to enter the city in a civilian dress. You are about my size, and I  beg you to furnish me with a suit of your clothes, for which I will  pay at once.\"    \"I will do that willingly, sir,\" the landlord answered, feeling  much honoured by being let into what he deemed an important affair.  \"My best suit is at your service. You can send it me out from the  town.\"    \"I would rather pay for it, landlord. I may be ordered in another  direction, and may not have an opportunity of returning it. If you  will say how much the suit cost you, I will hand you the money.\"    The landlord went out, and returned in a minute with the clothes.    \"Another glass of wine, landlord,\" Fergus said, as he handed over  the amount at which the landlord valued them--\"another glass of  wine; and then, while I am changing, get a light trap round to the  door. I shall not want to take it into Vienna, but will alight and  send it back again, half a mile this side of the gates.  Mind--should any inquiries be made, it were best to say as little  as possible.\"    In another five minutes, Fergus was on his way again. He had  procured from the landlord a small trunk, in which he had packed  the uniform, and directed him to keep it until he heard from him;  but if in the course of a week he received no orders, he was to  forward it to Major Steiner, at Spielberg.    When within half a mile of Vienna, Fergus got out, gave a present  to the driver and told him to return, and then walked forward to  the gate, which he entered without question. He thought it better  not to put up in that quarter of the town, but walked a long  distance through the city, purchased a travelling coat lined with  sheepskin, and a small canvas trunk in which he put it; went some  distance farther and hired a room at a quiet inn, and called for  dinner, of which he felt much in need, for beyond eating a few  mouthfuls of bread while a fresh horse was brought out for him, he  had tasted nothing since the previous evening. After dining he went  to his room and took his boots off and, feeling completely worn out  from his long journey, after two months of confinement, threw  himself on the bed and slept for three hours.    Then he went for an hour's stroll through the town. By this time it  was getting dark, snowflakes were beginning to fall thickly, and he  was very glad, after sitting for a time listening to the talk in  the parlour of the inn, to turn in for the night.    In the morning the ground was covered with snow. He was glad to put  on his thick coat, for the cold outside was bitter.    For some hours he walked about Vienna, and the contrast between  that city and Berlin struck him greatly. The whole bearing and  manner of the people was brighter, and gayer. The soldiers, of whom  there were great numbers in the streets--Austrians, Croats, and  Hungarians--had none of the formal stiffness of the Prussians, but  laughed and joked as they went, and seemed as easy and light  hearted as the civilians around them. They were, for the most part,  inferior in size and physique to the Prussians; but there was a  springiness in their walk, and an alertness and intelligence which  were wanting in the more solid soldier of the north.    He spent the day in making himself acquainted with the town, the  position of the gates, and other particulars which might be  important to him; as he could not feel sure of the reception that  he would meet with, when he presented his letter.    In the afternoon the city was particularly gay. Sledges made their  appearance in the streets, and all seemed delighted that winter had  set in, in earnest.    The next morning, after breakfast, Fergus went to the mansion of  Count Platurn, whose position he had ascertained on the previous  day. The name had been scored under, in his list, as one on whom he  might confidently rely.    \"I am the bearer of a letter to Count Platurn,\" he said, to the  somewhat gorgeously-dressed functionary who opened the door. \"I  have a message to deliver to him, personally.\"    The doorkeeper closed the door behind him and spoke to a footman,  who went away and returned, in a minute or two, and told Fergus to  follow him to a spacious and comfortable library, where the count  was sitting alone.    \"You are the bearer of a letter to me, sir?\" he said, in a pleasant  tone of voice. \"Whence do you bring it?\"    \"From Count Eulenfurst of Dresden,\" Fergus said, producing it.    The count gave an exclamation of pleasure.    \"Has he completely recovered?\" he asked. \"Of course, we heard of  the outrage of which he was a sufferer.\"    \"He was going on well when I saw him last, count.\"    The count opened the letter and read it, with an air of growing  surprise as he went on. When he had finished it, he rose from his  seat and offered his hand to Fergus.    \"You are the Scottish officer who saved the lives of the count, his  wife, and daughter,\" he said warmly. \"How you come to be here I  don't know, but it is enough for me that you rendered my dear  friend and his wife, who is a cousin of mine, this great service.  You are not here, I hope, on any mission which, as an Austrian  noble, I could feel it impossible to further.\"    \"No indeed, count. Had it been so, I should assuredly not have  presented this letter to you. In giving it to me, the countess said  that possibly the fortune of war might be unfavourable, and that I  might be taken prisoner. In that case, she said I might find a  friend invaluable, and she gave me letters to eight gentlemen in  various great towns, saying that she believed that any one of these  would, for the sake of the count, do me any kindness in his power.    \"Her prevision has turned out correct. My horse was shot under me  at the battle of Lobositz, and I was made prisoner and sent to the  fortress of Spielberg. Three days since I effected my escape, and  deemed it more prudent to make my way here, where no one would  suspect me of coming, instead of striving to journey up through  Bohemia.\"    \"You effected your escape from Spielberg!\" the count repeated, in  surprise. \"That is indeed a notable feat, for it is one of our  strongest prisons; but you shall tell me about that, presently.    \"Now, about Count Eulenfurst. The affair created quite a sensation,  partly from the rank and well-known position of the count, partly  from the fact that the King of Prussia, himself, called upon the  count to express his sincere regret at what had occurred, and the  vigorous steps that he took to put a stop to all acts of pillage  and marauding. It was said at the time that, had it not been for  the opportune arrival of a young Scottish officer, an aide-de-camp  to Marshal Keith, the lives of the count and his family would  assuredly have been sacrificed; and that the king, in token of his  approbation, had promoted the officer upon the spot.    \"But I pray you, take off that warm coat, and make yourself at  home.\"    He touched a bell. A servant entered immediately.    \"If anyone calls, say that I am engaged on business, and can see no  one this morning. Place two chairs by the fire, and bring in wine  and glasses.\"    Two chairs were moved to the fire. Wine was placed close at hand on  a small table,"]]]
