When the case came up  in the Federal Court of Eastern Arkansas, the judge who presided  declared that the federal law under which the defendant was being tried  was unconstitutional, and wrote a lengthy decision, giving his reasons  for holding this view.  Within the next two months two other federal  courts rendered similar decisions.    At this point the Department of Justice decided to bring no further  cases to trial until the United States Supreme Court should pass on the  constitutionality of the law, the Arkansas case having {188} already  been brought before this tribunal.  At this writing the decision has  not been rendered.    _Only Bird Treaty in the World._--Early in the history of the  operations of this law the possibilities of an adverse decision by the  Supreme Court were considered by those interested in the measure, and a  plan was found whereby all might not be lost if such a catastrophe  should occur.  The first movement in this new direction was made by  Elihu Root on January 14, 1913, when he introduced in the Senate a  resolution requesting the President to propose to the other governments  the negotiation of a convention for the protection of birds.  A  proposed bird treaty between this country and Canada was then drawn up,  and after much effort was brought to a successful issue and was finally  ratified by Congress on September 29, 1916.    This treaty broadly covers the provisions of the Migratory Bird Law in  this country, so if the Supreme Court declares the latter to be invalid  the Government still stands committed to the {189} principals of  migratory bird-protection by virtue of the treaty.    So the long fight to stop spring shooting and provide short uniform  closed seasons for shooting shore birds and wild fowl is drawing to a  glorious conclusion.    To-day, in the history of wild-life conservation, we have before us the  unusual spectacle of the United States Government taking a serious hand  in a problem which had been found to be too difficult of solution by  the different states working separately.  Many of us believe this  predicts a brighter day for the perpetuation of the wild life of our  country.          {190}    CHAPTER X    BIRD RESERVATIONS    The creation of reservations where wild birds can be protected at all  times is a modern idea, brought prominently to public attention by the  efforts of the Audubon Society.  The first interest that the United  States Government manifested in the subject was about thirteen years  ago.  On May 29, 1901, the legislature of Florida was induced to enact  a statute making it a misdemeanour to kill any non-game birds of the  State with the exception of the Crow and a few other species regarded  by the lawmakers as being injurious to man's interests.    First Federal Bird Reservation--Shortly afterward the Audubon Society  friends employed a man to protect from the raids of tourists and  feather hunters a {191} large colony of Brown Pelicans that used for  nesting purposes a small, muddy, mangrove-covered island in Indian  River on the Atlantic Coast.  Soon murmurings began to be heard.  \"Pelicans eat fish and should not be protected,\" declared one Floridan.  \"We need Pelican quills to sell to the feather dealers,\" chimed in  another with a keen eye to the main chance.  There was talk of  repealing the law at the next session of the legislature, and the  hearts of the Audubon workers were troubled.  At first they thought of  buying the island, so as to be in a position to protect its feathered  inhabitants by preventing trespass.  However, it proved to be  unsurveyed Government land, and the idea was suggested of getting the  Government to make a reservation for the protection of the birds.  The  matter was submitted to President Roosevelt, who no sooner ascertained  the facts that the land was not suited for agricultural purposes, and  that the Audubon Society would guard it, than with characteristic  directness he issued the following remarkable edict: \"It is hereby  ordered that Pelican {192} Island in Indian River is reserved and set  apart for the use of the Department of Agriculture as a preserve and  breeding ground for native birds.\"    The gist of this order, bearing the authorization of the Secretary of  Agriculture, was quickly painted on a large sign, and placed on the  island, where all who sailed near might read.  Imagine the chagrin of  the Audubon workers upon learning from their warden that when the  Pelicans returned that season to occupy the island as before, they took  one look at this declaration of the President and immediately departed,  one and all, to a neighbouring island entirely outside of the  reservation!  Signs less alarming in size were substituted, and the  Pelicans, their feelings appeased, condescended to return, and have  since dwelt peacefully under the protecting care of the Government.    _Congressional Sanction._--In view of the fact that some persons  contended that the President had over-stepped his authority in making a  bird reservation, a law was drafted, and passed by Congress,  specifically {193} giving protection to birds on lands set apart as  National bird reservations.  The legal difficulties thus removed, the  way lay open for the creation of other bird reservations, and the  Audubon Society seized the opportunity.  Explorations were started to  locate other Government territories containing important colonies of  water birds.  This work was quickly extended over many parts of the  United States.  Hunters of eggs and plumes were busy plying their  trades wherever birds were known to assemble in great numbers, and the  work had to be hurried if the birds were to be saved.    [Illustration: The Downy Woodpecker is fond of suet]    Mr. Frank M. Miller, of New Orleans, reported a case in which five  thousand eggs had been broken on one Louisiana island inhabited by sea  birds in order that fresh eggs might subsequently be gathered into the  boats waiting at anchor off shore.  No wonder that friends of water  birds were profoundly concerned about their future welfare, and hailed  with delight Mr. Roosevelt's quick action.    Mr. William Dutcher, President of the National {194} Association of  Audubon Societies, was so much pleased with the results achieved by the  Federal reservation work of 1905, that he declared in his annual report  that the existence of the Association was justified if it had done  nothing more than secure Federal bird reservations and had helped to  guard them during the breeding season.    That year President Roosevelt established four more bird refuges.  One  of these, Stump Lake, in North Dakota, became an important nursery for  Gulls, Terns, Ducks, and Cormorants in summer, and a safe harbour for  wild fowl during the spring and fall migrations.  Huron Island and  Siskiwit in Lake Superior, the homes of innumerable Herring Gulls, were  made perpetual bird sanctuaries, and Audubon wardens took up their  lonely watch to guard them against all comers.    _Florida Reservations._--At the mouth of Tampa Bay, Florida, is a  ninety-acre island, Passage Key.  Here the wild bird life of the Gulf  Coast has swarmed in the mating season since white man first knew the  {195} country.  Thousands of Herons of various species, as well as  Terns and shore birds, make this their home.  Dainty little Ground  Doves flutter in and out among the cactus on the sheltered sides of the  sand dunes; Plovers and Sandpipers chase each other along the beaches,  and the Burrowing Owls here hide in their holes by night and roam over  the island by day.    When this place was described to President Roosevelt, he immediately  declared that the birds must not be killed there without the consent of  the Secretary of Agriculture.  With one stroke of his pen he brought  this desirable condition into existence, and Mrs. Asa Pillsbury was  duly appointed to protect the island.  She is one of the few women bird  wardens in America.    These things happened in the early days of Government work for the  protection of water birds.  The Audubon Society had found a new field  for endeavour, highly prolific in results.  With the limited means at  its command the work of ornithological exploration was carried forward.  Every island, mud flat, and sand bar along the coast of the Mexican  {196} Gulf, from Texas to Key West, was visited by trained  ornithologists who reported their findings to the New York office.  These were forwarded to Washington for the approval of Dr. T. S. Palmer  of the Biological Survey, and Frank Bond, of the General Land Office,  where executive orders were prepared for the President's signature.    The Breton Island Reservation off the coast of Louisiana, including  scores of islands and bars, was established in 1904.  Six additional  reservations were soon created along the west coast of Florida, thus  extending a perpetual guardianship over the colonies of sea and  coastwise birds in that territory--the pitiful remnants of vast  rookeries despoiled to add to the profits of the millinery trade.    The work was early started in the West resulting in the Malheur Lake  and Klamath Lake reservations of Oregon.  The latter is to-day the  summer home of myriads of Ducks, Geese, Grebes, White Pelicans, and  other wild waterfowl, and never a week passes that the waters of the  lake are not fretted with the {197} prow of the Audubon patrol boat, as  the watchful warden extends his vigil over the feathered wards of our  Government.    Federal bird reservations have been formed not only of lakes with reedy  margins and lonely islands in the sea, they have been made to include  numerous Government reservoirs built in the arid regions of the West.    _Distant Reservations._--Once set in motion, this movement for Federal  bird reservations soon swept beyond the boundaries of the United  States.

EVASIONS AND DENIALS OF THE ABOLITION OF EPISCOPAL, AND ESTABLISHMENT OF  CONGREGATIONAL WORSHIP AT MASSACHUSETTS BAY; PROOFS OF THE FACTS, THAT  THE COMPANY AND FIRST SETTLERS OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY WERE PROFESSED  EPISCOPALIANS WHEN THE LATTER LEFT ENGLAND; LETTERS OF THE LONDON  COMPANY AGAINST THE INNOVATIONS WHICH ABOLISHED THE EPISCOPAL, AND  ESTABLISHED CONGREGATIONAL WORSHIP BY THE \"ADVENTURERS\" AFTER CROSSING  THE ATLANTIC; THIS THE FIRST SEED OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, AND OF  CRUEL PERSECUTIONS.      When the Browns arrived in England as banished \"criminals\" from the  Plantation to which they had gone four months before as members of the  Council of Government, and with the highest commendation of the London  General Court itself, they naturally made their complaints against the  conduct of Endicot in superseding the Church of England by the  establishment of a new confession of faith and a new form of worship. It  is worthy of remark, that in the Records of the Company the specific  subjects of complaint by the Browns are carefully kept out of  sight--only that a \"dispute\" or \"difference\" had arisen between them and  \"Governor Endicot;\" but what that difference was is nowhere mentioned in  the Records of the Company. The letters of Endicot and the Browns were  put into the hands of Goffe, the Deputy Governor of the Company; were  never published; and they are said to have been \"missing\" unto this day.  Had the real cause and subject of difference been known in England, and  been duly represented to the Privy Council, the Royal Charter would  undoubtedly have been forthwith forfeited and cancelled; but the  Puritan-party feeling of the Browns seems to have been appealed to not  to destroy the Company and their enterprise; that in case of not  prosecuting their complaints before a legal tribunal, the matter would  be referred to a jointly selected Committee of the Council to arbitrate  on the affair; and that in the meantime the conduct of Endicot in making  Church innovations (if he had made them) would be disclaimed by the  Company. To render the Browns powerless to sustain their complaints,  their letters were seized[44] and their statements were denied.    Nevertheless, the rumours and reports from the new Plantation of  Massachusetts produced a strong impression in England, and excited great  alarm among the members and friends of the Company, who adopted three  methods of securing themselves and their Charter, and of saving the  Plantation from the consequences of Endicot's alleged innovations and  violent conduct. Firstly--The Governor of the Company, Mr. Cradock,  wrote to Endicot, Higginson, and Skelton, professing doubts of the truth  of the charges made against them--disclaiming and warning them against  the reported innovations--thus protecting themselves in case of charge  from all participation in or responsibility for such proceedings.  Secondly--They positively denied the statements of the Browns as to  Endicot's alleged \"innovations,\" and used every means to depreciate the  trustworthiness and character of the Browns, notwithstanding their  former commendation of them and their acknowledged respectability.  Thirdly--They prepared and published documents declaring their adherence  to the Church of England, and the calumny of the charges and rumours put  forth against them as being disaffected to it.    1. Their Governor, Mr. Cradock, wrote to Endicot in the name of the  Company. This letter, dated October 16, 1629, is given at length in a  note.[46] It will be seen by this letter how strongly the Company  condemned the innovations charged against Endicot by the Browns, and how  imperatively they direct him to correct them, while they profess to  doubt whether he could have been a party to any such proceedings. In  this letter is also the most explicit testimony by the Company of the  King's kindness and generosity to them, as well as a statement of the  clear understanding between the King and the Company as to the  intentions and spirit of the Royal Charter, and which the Company in  London expressed their determination to observe in good faith--a good  faith which was invariably and even indulgently observed by both Charles  the First and Second, but which was as constantly violated by the  Government of Massachusetts Bay, as will appear hereafter from the  transfer of the Charter there in 1630, to the cancelling of the Charter  under James the Second, in 1687. Endicot, confident in his ability to  prevent the transmission of any evidence to England that could sustain  the statements of the Browns, paid no heed to the instructions of the  Company, and persisted in his course of Church revolution and  proscription.    The letter addressed to Higginson and Skelton was signed not only by the  Governor, but by the chief members of the Company, and among others by  John Winthrop, who took the Royal Charter to Massachusetts Bay, and  there, as Governor, administered it by maintaining all that Endicot was  alleged to have done, continued to proscribe the worship of the Church  of England, allowed its members no elective franchise as well as no  eligibility for office, and persecuted all who attempted to worship in  any other form than that of the Church of Endicot, Higginson and  Skelton--a course in which he persevered until his energies began to  fail; for Mr. Bancroft says: \"The elder Winthrop had, I believe,  relented before his death, and, it is said, had become weary of  banishing heretics; the soul of the younger Winthrop [who withdrew from  the intolerance of the Massachusetts Puritans, and was elected Governor  of Connecticut] was incapable of harbouring a thought of intolerant  cruelty; but the rugged Dudley was not mellowed by old age.\"[49]    The letter addressed to Higginson and Skelton expressed a hope that the  report made, in England as to their language and proceedings were \"but  shadows,\" but at the same time apprised them of their duty to vindicate  their innocency or acknowledge and reform their misdeeds, declaring the  favour of the Government to their Plantation, and their duty and  determination not to abuse the confidence which the State had reposed  in them. This letter is given entire in a note.[50]    Nothing can be more clear, from the letters addressed by the Company  both to Endicot and the ministers Higginson and Skelton, that  renunciation of the worship of the Church of England was at variance  with the intentions and profession of all parties in granting and  receiving the Royal Charter, and that the only defence set up in England  of Endicot, Higginson, and Skelton was a positive denial that they had  done so. Dudley himself, Deputy Governor, who went to Massachusetts Bay  in the same fleet of eleven ships with Governor Winthrop, wrote to his  patroness, the Countess of Lincoln, several months after his arrival,  and in his letter, dated March 12, 1630, explicitly denies the existence  of any such changes in their worship as had been alleged; that they had  become \"Brownists [that is, Congregationalists] in religion,\" etc., and  declaring all such allegations to be \"false and scandalous reports;\"  appealing to their friends in England to \"not easily believe that we are  so soon turned from the profession we so long have made at home in our  native land;\" declaring that he knew \"no one person who came over with  us last year to be altered in judgment or affection, either in  ecclesiastical or civil respects, since our coming here;\" acknowledging  the obligations of himself and friends to the King for the royal  kindness to them, and praying his friends in England to \"give no credit  to such malicious aspersions, but be more ready to answer for us than we  hear they have been.\" Dudley's own words are given in note.[51] The only  escape from the admission of Dudley's statements being utterly untrue is  resort to a quibble which is inconsistent with candour and  honesty--namely, that the Brownist or Congregational worship had been  adopted by Endicot and his party before the arrival of Dudley; but the  scope and evident design of his letter was to assure the Countess of  Lincoln and his friends in England that no new Church worship had been  established at Massachusetts Bay, when the reverse must have been known  to Dudley, and when he, in support of the new Brownist or Congregational  worship, became a fierce persecutor, even to old age, of all who would  not conform to it; for, as Mr. Bancroft says, \"the rugged soul of Dudley  was not mellowed by old age.\"    But while Dudley, in Massachusetts, was denying to his English friends  the existence of ecclesiastical changes there which all history now  declares to have taken place, the \"Patriar"]]]
