My scorpions--have you met my scorpions?  No?  My pythons and  hamadryads?  Then there are my fungi and my tiny allies, the bacilli.  I have a collection in my laboratory quite unique.  Have you ever  visited Molokai, the leper island, Doctor?  No?  But Mr. Nayland Smith  will be familiar with the asylum at Rangoon!  And we must not forget my  black spiders, with their diamond eyes--my spiders, that sit in the  dark and watch--then leap!\"    He raised his lean hands, so that the sleeve of the robe fell back to  the elbow, and the ape dropped, chattering, to the floor and ran from  the cellar.    \"O God of Cathay!\" he cried, \"by what death shall these die--these  miserable ones who would bind thine Empire, which is boundless!\"    Like some priest of Tezcat he stood, his eyes upraised to the roof, his  lean body quivering--a sight to shock the most unimpressionable mind.    \"He is mad!\" I whispered to Smith.  \"God help us, the man is a  dangerous homicidal maniac!\"    Nayland Smith's tanned face was very drawn, but he shook his head  grimly.    \"Dangerous, yes, I agree,\" he muttered; \"his existence is a danger to  the entire white race which, now, we are powerless to avert.\"    Dr. Fu-Manchu recovered himself, took up the lantern and, turning  abruptly, walked to the door, with his awkward, yet feline gait.  At  the threshold be looked back.    \"You would have warned Mr. Graham Guthrie?\" he said, in a soft voice.  \"To-night, at half-past twelve, Mr. Graham Guthrie dies!\"    Smith sat silent and motionless, his eyes fixed upon the speaker.    \"You were in Rangoon in 1908?\" continued Dr. Fu-Manchu--\"you remember  the Call?\"    From somewhere above us--I could not determine the exact  direction--came a low, wailing cry, an uncanny thing of falling  cadences, which, in that dismal vault, with the sinister yellow-robed  figure at the door, seemed to pour ice into my veins.  Its effect upon  Smith was truly extraordinary.  His face showed grayly in the faint  light, and I heard him draw a hissing breath through clenched teeth.    \"It calls for you!\" said Fu-Manchu. \"At half-past twelve it calls for  Graham Guthrie!\"    The door closed and darkness mantled us again.    \"Smith,\" I said, \"what was that?\"  The horrors about us were playing  havoc with my nerves.    \"It was the Call of Siva!\" replied Smith hoarsely.    \"What is it?  Who uttered it?  What does it mean?\"    \"I don't know what it is, Petrie, nor who utters it.  But it means  death!\"        CHAPTER XIV      THERE may be some who could have lain, chained to that noisome cell,  and felt no fear--no dread of what the blackness might hold.  I confess  that I am not one of these.  I knew that Nayland Smith and I stood in  the path of the most stupendous genius who in the world's history had  devoted his intellect to crime.  I knew that the enormous wealth of the  political group backing Dr. Fu-Manchu rendered him a menace to Europe  and to America greater than that of the plague.  He was a scientist  trained at a great university--an explorer of nature's secrets, who had  gone farther into the unknown, I suppose, than any living man.  His  mission was to remove all obstacles--human obstacles--from the path of  that secret movement which was progressing in the Far East.  Smith and  I were two such obstacles; and of all the horrible devices at his  command, I wondered, and my tortured brain refused to leave the  subject, by which of them were we doomed to be dispatched?    Even at that very moment some venomous centipede might be wriggling  towards me over the slime of the stones, some poisonous spider be  preparing to drop from the roof!  Fu-Manchu might have released a  serpent in the cellar, or the air be alive with microbes of a loathsome  disease!    \"Smith,\" I said, scarcely recognizing my own voice, \"I can't bear this  suspense.  He intends to kill us, that is certain, but--\"    \"Don't worry,\" came the reply; \"he intends to learn our plans first.\"    \"You mean--?\"    \"You heard him speak of his files and of his wire jacket?\"    \"Oh, my God!\" I groaned; \"can this be England?\"    Smith laughed dryly, and I heard him fumbling with the steel collar  about his neck.    \"I have one great hope,\" he said, \"since you share my captivity, but we  must neglect no minor chance.  Try with your pocket-knife if you can  force the lock.  I am trying to break this one.\"    Truth to tell, the idea had not entered my half-dazed mind, but I  immediately acted upon my friend's suggestion, setting to work with the  small blade of my knife.  I was so engaged, and, having snapped one  blade, was about to open another, when a sound arrested me.  It came  from beneath my feet.    \"Smith,\" I whispered, \"listen!\"    The scraping and clicking which told of Smith's efforts ceased.  Motionless, we sat in that humid darkness and listened.    Something was moving beneath the stones of the cellar.  I held my  breath; every nerve in my body was strung up.    A line of light showed a few feet from where we lay.  It  widened--became an oblong.  A trap was lifted, and within a yard of me,  there rose a dimly seen head.  Horror I had expected--and death, or  worse.  Instead, I saw a lovely face, crowned with a disordered mass of  curling hair; I saw a white arm upholding the stone slab, a shapely arm  clasped about the elbow by a broad gold bangle.    The girl climbed into the cellar and placed the lantern on the stone  floor.  In the dim light she was unreal--a figure from an opium vision,  with her clinging silk draperies and garish jewelry, with her feet  encased in little red slippers.  In short, this was the houri of my  vision, materialized.  It was difficult to believe that we were in  modern, up-to-date England; easy to dream that we were the captives of  a caliph, in a dungeon in old Bagdad.    \"My prayers are answered,\" said Smith softly.  \"She has come to save  YOU.\"    \"S-sh!\" warned the girl, and her wonderful eyes opened widely,  fearfully.  \"A sound and he will kill us all.\"    She bent over me; a key jarred in the lock which had broken my  penknife--and the collar was off.  As I rose to my feet the girl turned  and released Smith.  She raised the lantern above the trap, and signed  to us to descend the wooden steps which its light revealed.    \"Your knife,\" she whispered to me.  \"Leave it on the floor.  He will  think you forced the locks.  Down!  Quickly!\"    Nayland Smith, stepping gingerly, disappeared into the darkness.  I  rapidly followed.  Last of all came our mysterious friend, a gold band  about one of her ankles gleaming in the rays of the lantern which she  carried.  We stood in a low-arched passage.    \"Tie your handkerchiefs over your eyes and do exactly as I tell you,\"  she ordered.    Neither of us hesitated to obey her.  Blind-folded, I allowed her to  lead me, and Smith rested his hand upon my shoulder.  In that order we  proceeded, and came to stone steps, which we ascended.    \"Keep to the wall on the left,\" came a whisper.  \"There is danger on  the right.\"    With my free hand I felt for and found the wall, and we pressed  forward.  The atmosphere of the place through which we were passing was  steamy, and loaded with an odor like that of exotic plant life.  But a  faint animal scent crept to my nostrils, too, and there was a subdued  stir about me, infinitely suggestive--mysterious.    Now my feet sank in a soft carpet, and a curtain brushed my shoulder.  A gong sounded.  We stopped.    The din of distant drumming came to my ears.    \"Where in Heaven's name are we?\" hissed Smith in my ear; \"that is a  tom-tom!\"    \"S-sh!  S-sh!\"    The little hand grasping mine quivered nervously.  We were near a door  or a window, for a breath of perfume was wafted through the air; and it  reminded me of my other meetings with the beautiful woman who was now  leading us from the house of Fu-Manchu; who, with her own lips, had  told me that she was his slave.  Through the horrible phantasmagoria  she flitted--a seductive vision, her piquant loveliness standing out  richly in its black setting of murder and devilry.  Not once, but a  thousand times, I had tried to reason out the nature of the tie which  bound her to the sinister Doctor.    Silence fell.    \"Quick!  This way!\"    Down a thickly carpeted stair we went.  Our guide opened a door, and  led us along a passage.  Another door was opened; and we were in the  open air.  But the girl never tarried, pulling me along a graveled  path, with a fresh breeze blowing in my face, and along until,  unmistakably, I stood upon the river bank.  Now, planking creaked to  our tread; and looking downward beneath the handkerchief, I saw the  gleam of water beneath my feet.    \"Be careful!\"  I was warned, and found myself stepping into a narrow  boat--a punt.    Nayland Smith followed, and the girl pushed the punt off and poled out  into the stream.    \"Don't speak!\" she directed.    My brain was fevered; I scarce knew if I dreamed and was waking, or if  the reality ended with my imprisonment in the clammy cellar and this  silent escape, blindfolded, upon the river with a girl for our guide  who might have stepped out of the pages of \"The Arabian Nights\" were  fantasy--the mockery of sleep.    Indeed, I began seriously to doubt if this stream whereon we floated,  whose waters plashed and tinkled about us, were the Thames, the Tigris,  or the Styx.    The punt touched a bank.    \"You will hear a clock strike in a few minutes,\" said the girl, with  her soft, charming accent, \"but I rely upon your honor not to remove  the handkerchiefs until then.  You owe me this.\"    \"We do!\" said Smith fervently.    I heard him scrambling to the bank, and a moment later a soft hand was  placed in mine, and I, too, was guided on to terra firma.  Arrived on  the bank, I still held the girl's hand, drawing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],[0,"The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#20)"],[1,", must knowingly or unknowingly  buy adulterated goods in order to sell at the lower prices required, and  to meet the competition of the others.  Further, a large retail dealer  who has extensive capital invested in his business is ruined with his  ruined credit if detected in a fraudulent practice; but what harm does it  do a small grocer, who has customers in a single street only, if frauds  are proved against him?  If no one trusts him in Ancoats, he moves to  Chorlton or Hulme, where no one knows him, and where he continues to  defraud as before; while legal penalties attach to very few adulterations  unless they involve revenue frauds.  Not in the quality alone, but in the  quantity of his goods as well, is the English working-man defrauded.  The  small dealers usually have false weights and measures, and an incredible  number of convictions for such offences may be read in the police  reports.  How universal this form of fraud is in the manufacturing  districts, a couple of extracts from the _Manchester Guardian_ may serve  to show.  They cover only a short period, and, even here, I have not all  the numbers at hand:    _Guardian_, June 16, 1844, Rochdale Sessions.--Four dealers fined five to  ten shillings for using light weights.  Stockport Sessions.--Two dealers  fined one shilling, one of them having seven light weights and a false  scale, and both having been warned.    _Guardian_, June 19, Rochdale Sessions.--One dealer fined five, and two  farmers ten shillings.    _Guardian_, June 22, Manchester Justices of the Peace.--Nineteen dealers  fined two shillings and sixpence to two pounds.    _Guardian_, June 26, Ashton Sessions.--Fourteen dealers and farmers fined  two shillings and sixpence to one pound.  Hyde Petty Sessions.--Nine  farmers and dealers condemned to pay costs and five shillings fines.    _Guardian_, July 9, Manchester--Sixteen dealers condemned to pay costs  and fines not exceeding ten shillings.    _Guardian_, July 13, Manchester.--Nine dealers fined from two shillings  and sixpence to twenty shillings.    _Guardian_, July 24, Rochdale.--Four dealers fined ten to twenty  shillings.    _Guardian_, July 27, Bolton.--Twelve dealers and innkeepers condemned to  pay costs.    _Guardian_, August 3, Bolton.--Three dealers fined two shillings and  sixpence, and five shillings.    _Guardian_, August 10, Bolton.--One dealer fined five shillings.    And the same causes which make the working-class the chief sufferers from  frauds in the quality of goods make them the usual victims of frauds in  the question of quantity too.    The habitual food of the individual working-man naturally varies  according to his wages.  The better paid workers, especially those in  whose families every member is able to earn something, have good food as  long as this state of things lasts; meat daily, and bacon and cheese for  supper.  Where wages are less, meat is used only two or three times a  week, and the proportion of bread and potatoes increases.  Descending  gradually, we find the animal food reduced to a small piece of bacon cut  up with the potatoes; lower still, even this disappears, and there remain  only bread, cheese, porridge, and potatoes, until on the lowest round of  the ladder, among the Irish, potatoes form the sole food.  As an  accompaniment, weak tea, with perhaps a little sugar, milk, or spirits,  is universally drunk.  Tea is regarded in England, and even in Ireland,  as quite as indispensable as coffee in Germany, and where no tea is used,  the bitterest poverty reigns.  But all this pre-supposes that the workman  has work.  When he has none, he is wholly at the mercy of accident, and  eats what is given him, what he can beg or steal.  And, if he gets  nothing, he simply starves, as we have seen.  The quantity of food  varies, of course, like its quality, according to the rate of wages, so  that among ill-paid workers, even if they have no large families, hunger  prevails in spite of full and regular work; and the number of the ill-  paid is very large.  Especially in London, where the competition of the  workers rises with the increase of population, this class is very  numerous, but it is to be found in other towns as well.  In these cases  all sorts of devices are used; potato parings, vegetable refuse, and  rotten vegetables are eaten for want of other food, and everything  greedily gathered up which may possibly contain an atom of nourishment.  And, if the week's wages are used up before the end of the week, it often  enough happens that in the closing days the family gets only as much  food, if any, as is barely sufficient to keep off starvation.  Of course  such a way of living unavoidably engenders a multitude of diseases, and  when these appear, when the father from whose work the family is chiefly  supported, whose physical exertion most demands nourishment, and who  therefore first succumbs--when the father is utterly disabled, then  misery reaches its height, and then the brutality with which society  abandons its members, just when their need is greatest, comes out fully  into the light of day.    To sum up briefly the facts thus far cited.  The great towns are chiefly  inhabited by working-people, since in the best case there is one  bourgeois for two workers, often for three, here and there for four;  these workers have no property whatsoever of their own, and live wholly  upon wages, which usually go from hand to mouth.  Society, composed  wholly of atoms, does not trouble itself about them; leaves them to care  for themselves and their families, yet supplies them no means of doing  this in an efficient and permanent manner.  Every working-man, even the  best, is therefore constantly exposed to loss of work and food, that is  to death by starvation, and many perish in this way.  The dwellings of  the workers are everywhere badly planned, badly built, and kept in the  worst condition, badly ventilated, damp, and unwholesome.  The  inhabitants are confined to the smallest possible space, and at least one  family usually sleeps in each room.  The interior arrangement of the  dwellings is poverty-stricken in various degrees, down to the utter  absence of even the most necessary furniture.  The clothing of the  workers, too, is generally scanty, and that of great multitudes is in  rags.  The food is, in general, bad; often almost unfit for use, and in  many cases, at least at times, insufficient in quantity, so that, in  extreme cases, death by starvation results.  Thus the working-class of  the great cities offers a graduated scale of conditions in life, in the  best cases a temporarily endurable existence for hard work and good  wages, good and endurable, that is, from the worker's standpoint; in the  worst cases, bitter want, reaching even homelessness and death by  starvation.  The average is much nearer the worst case than the best.  And  this series does not fall into fixed classes, so that one can say, this  fraction of the working-class is well off, has always been so, and  remains so.  If that is the case here and there, if single branches of  work have in general an advantage over others, yet the condition of the  workers in each branch is subject to such great fluctuations that a  single working-man may be so placed as to pass through the whole range  from comparative comfort to the extremest need, even to death by  starvation, while almost every English working-man can tell a tale of  marked changes of fortune.  Let us examine the causes of this somewhat  more closely.          COMPETITION.      We have seen in the introduction how competition created the proletariat  at the very beginning of the industrial movement, by increasing the wages  of weavers in consequence of the increased demand for woven goods, so  inducing the weaving peasants to abandon their farms and earn more money  by devoting themselves to their looms.  We have seen how it crowded out  the small farmers by means of the large farm system, reduced them to the  rank of proletarians, and attracted them in part into the towns; how it  further ruined the small bourgeoisie in great measure and reduced its  members also to the ranks of the proletariat; how it centralised capital  in the hands of the few, and population in the great towns.  Such are the  various ways and means by which competition, as it reached its full  manifestation and free development in modern industry, created and  extended the proletariat.  We shall now have to observe its influence on  the working-class already created.  And here we must begin by tracing the  results of competition of single workers with one another.    Competition is the completest expression of the battle of all against all  which rules in modern civil society.  This battle, a battle for life, for  existence, for everything, in case of need a battle of life and death, is  fought not between the different classes of society only, but also  between the individual members of these classes.  Each is in the way of  the other, and each seeks to crowd out all who are in his way, and to put  himself in their place.  The workers are in constant competition among  themselves as the members of the bourgeoisie among themselves.  The power-  loom weaver is in competition with the hand-loom weaver, the unemployed  or ill-paid hand-loom weaver with him who has work or is better paid,  each trying to supplant the other.  But this competition of the workers  among themselves is the worst side of the present state of things in its  effect upon the worker, the sharpest weapon against the proletariat in  the hands of the bourgeoisie.  Hence the effort of the workers to nullify  this competition by associations, hence the hatred of the bourgeoisie  towards these associations, and its triumph in every defeat which befalls  them.    The proletarian is helpless; left to himself, he cannot live a single  day.  The bourgeoisie has gained a monopoly of all means of existence in"]]]
