Give each strong thought its most attractive view,    In diction clear, and yet severely true,    And as the arguments in splendor grow,    Let each reflect its light on all below.    When to the close arrive make no delays    By petty flourishes, or verbal plays,    But sum the whole in one deep solemn strain,    Like a strong current hastening to the main.\"    If Mr. Story had never been elevated to the bench it is not likely his  name would ever have become national property. Although plunged into  politics in his earlier life, he was not fitted for the life. His devotion  to the law, and his dread of becoming that slave to party usages which all  public men must necessarily more or less fashion of themselves, would have  retained him in his native state, and made his usefulness sectional. To  the politicians of the school of General Jackson, and to the  administration of that President, he was particularly distasteful. His  tenacious conservatism drew forth from the \"old hero,\" on one occasion,  the remark, that \"he was the most dangerous man in the country.\" Lord  Eldon, with his doubts and pertinacious toryism was not more unpopular  among the reformers in England than was Judge Story--the last of the old  regime of federal judges--with the bank radicals of 1832.    When Chief Justice Marshall died he felt almost broken-hearted. A new race  of constitutional expounders had arisen around him. Brother justices, with  modern constructions, and more liberal notions of national law, were by  his side. In many decisions he was now a sole dissenter. His pride was  invaded; his self-love tortured; his adoration of certain legal  constructions which he had deemed immutable in their nature, was  desecrated. And, for many years previous to his decease, he had  contemplated resigning from the federal judiciary, and living alone for  his darling law school.    This school was his adopted child. He had taken it in a feeble and  helpless infancy. He had given it strength and increased vitality. He  brought it up to a vigorous and useful maturity. It was loved by only a  handful of students when he gave his name and talents to aid its life: but  when he died, a hundred and fifty pupils were its warm suitors, and  hundreds of lawyers over the whole union cherished its prosperity as a  link in their own chains of happiness.    And, although he thought not of it, his labors in the law school secure  for his memory in the present generation a more brilliant existence than  his array of judicial decisions, and his thousands of written pages, can  ever bestow. In some pine forest settlement of Maine, or in some rude  court-house in California, there are lawyers who bring before them every  day his genial smiles and his impressive lectures, looked upon and heard  by them in former times at Cambridge. Over all the Union, in almost every  village, town, and city, are his pupils. Each one of them may sometimes  reflect with rapture upon their days of college life, or remember with  pride their first professional success: but not one of these  considerations of reminiscence is so grateful to his mind as the thought  of his novitiate with Justice Story. Depend upon it he treasures up those  Cambridge text-books, those Cambridge note-books whose leaves  daguerreotype the learning of the eminent deceased, those catalogues of  students where his name is proudly found, as the most valuable portions of  his library. He will never part with them: but they will descend to his  children.    It was our privilege and pleasure also to know Mr. Justice Story at  Cambridge; to have spent days of pleasure in the hours of his society; to  have rendered to his teachings the tribute of delighted attention and  grateful recollection. We, too, have been fascinated with that  conversation, whose variety of exuberance and sometimes egotism, were its  greatest ornaments. In the sunshine of his intellect our mind has sunned  itself, and been warmed into zealous and proselyting admiration. To his  gray-haired teachings we have paid personal reverence, and we unaffectedly  hope to have caught from his society and intercourse a spark of that  professional enthusiasm which is the only true guiding-star of the  plodding lawyer.    The December blasts are hoarsely sobbing to-night through Mount Auburn,  the garden of his mortal repose--the hallowed spot which his eloquence  consecrated in its origin, and which his religious love in his lifetime  sacredly cherished. The snows of winter and the autumn-woven carpet of  fallen leaves are heaped upon his honored grave, the sodded paths to  which, in the glowing spring-time and fragrant summer, are pressed most  frequent with the tread of faithful mourners. Years have passed since that  honored grave was first closed upon him. Longer years have flown since we  were under his teachings. But we seem to view him the same as of yore.  Again the class is assembled in the hushed lecture-room as his familiar  tread is heard at the door; or as the burst of applause, where there is no  sycophantic flattery known or felt, greets his entrance to his seat. Again  we see him adjusting his genial spectacles, and looking around upon the  upturned faces with parental pride. Again we hear his mellowed, although  often impetuous accents, expounding familiar principles of law, and  descending to the consideration of \"first things\" with as much pride and  carefulness as the artist treats his Rubens or Titian, which for years and  years has hung before him in all lights and shades and in every  combination of position.    Again, we occupy a modest corner of the library while he is holding his  moot court; infusing into the dignity of his manner a marked suavity of  disposition which never forsook him; or he is perpetrating some  appropriate legal joke to his audience, who never played upon his ease or  good nature.    Again, we have stolen into the self-same library while he is holding an  equity term of his circuit, to listen to the words of judicial wisdom  which came from his utterance, exuberant as pearls of fancy from the mouth  of an inspired poet.    Again, we see him at the summer twilight, seated by the trellised portico  of his hospitable and happy homestead, surrounded by family or friends,  enjoying the amenities of life with unaffected pleasure, and sometimes  awakening the garden echoes with his cheerful ringing laugh; or we see him  in the same hour of the day driving under the venerable elms of the  numerous commons, gazing and bowing around with all the pleasure which the  king of the fairy book marked upon his face when the love of his subjects,  among whom he passed, came forth with the evening breeze to bless and  greet him.    And then we pass into \"reverie,\" and live a few minutes of \"dream-life,\"  recalling to mind the maxims and sayings which were uttered in our  presence; and the many bright exemplars placed before his pupils, and the  kindly greetings which were showered all about--for he was no distinguisher  of persons so long as honor of feeling and uprightness of motive abounded  in his presence.    He is gone! Yet in these pages of biography before us he will always live.  From infancy to the ripened greatness of old age, his life is preserved to  posterity by the hand of his faithful and grateful son, whose duty has  been most ably and interestingly performed. The very minutiae of his life  are presented with fidelity and modesty of reference. Some may carp at  this; to these let us say with the French proverbialist, _Rien n'est  indifferent dans la vie d'un grand homme; le genie se revele dans ses  moindres actions_. The straws of every day life mark the direction of the  breezes of individual action.    To the hearts of his pupils we would send this epitaph, and ask them if  aught less tributary could be said of one who was and is to them a father.    Here sleeps the mortality of Joseph Story, who lived his days so well that  he won in a short lifetime an immortality of fame. His career as a _Man_  reflected lustre upon the lustre of an honored father's manhood, and added  to the virtues which his mother bequeathed him. As a _Politician_, he  rendered obeisance only to his conscience. As a _Lawyer_, he never  disgraced his profession by a thought, and even honored it by his  slightest acts. The colleague of Marshall, the two now shine together as  twin stars in the often contemplated firmament of _Judicial Renown_. Not  selfish of his _Learning_, it is scattered to the uttermost parts of the  earth, and is treasured wherever it has fallen. The learning which he  borrowed from continental Europe he repaid with magnificent interest. In  Westminster Hall his name is associated with Nottingham, Hale, Mansfield,  and Stowell. Counting as dross the wealth of professional eminence, he  became from the love of it an expounder of law to its tyros. He has spread  for thousands of adopted children a banquet of the treasures of legal  lore, and next to reverencing his paternal love they cherish with profound  gratitude the memory of his slightest instructions. While the Union of his  birthplace exists, her citizens will regard with unfeigned admiration his  constitutional teachings.            COLUMBUS AT THE GATES OF GENOA.                        WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE      BY THE AUTHOR OF \"NILE NOTES OF A HOWADJI.\"    Christopher Columbus was born at Genoa in 1437. In 1851 the Genoese are  finishing his monument.      I am Columbus: will ye let me in?    Or Doria in his palace by the sea.    Proud Andrea Doria named il Principe,    In your Republic named il Principe,    By Charles the Fifth, the Emperor of Spain,    Monopolizes he your meed of fame    Before the awful Judgment seat of Time.      Well, and Pisani, the Venetian, he,    Venice as Doria was Genoa,--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20116"],[0,"The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead, Volume 1 (of 3) (#20)"],[1,"said to the deity, \"When men die,  they would like not to come to life again.\" After that, up comes the  dog, and says he, \"When men die, they would like to come to life again.\"  God was naturally puzzled and said to the dog, \"I really do not  understand these two messages. As I heard the frog's request first, I  will comply with it. I will not do what you said.\" That is the real  reason why men die and do not come to life again. If the frog had only  minded his own business instead of meddling with other people's, the  dead would all have come to life again to this day.[64] In this version  of the story not only are the persons of the two messengers different,  the dog and the frog having replaced the chameleon and the lizard of the  Bantu version, but the messengers are sent from men to God instead of  from God to men.    [Sidenote: Ashantee story of the goat and the sheep.]    In another version told by the Ashantees of West Africa the persons of  the messengers are again different, but as in the Bantu version they are  sent from God to men. The Ashantees say that long ago men were happy,  for God dwelt among them and talked with them face to face. For example,  if a child was roasting yams at the fire and wanted a relish to eat with  the yams, he had nothing to do but to throw a stick in the air and say,  \"God give me fish,\" and God gave him fish at once. However, these happy  days did not last for ever. One unlucky day it happened that some women  were pounding a mash with pestles in a mortar, while God stood by  looking on. For some reason they were annoyed by the presence of the  deity and told him to be off; and as he did not take himself off fast  enough to please them, they beat him with their pestles. In a great huff  God retired altogether from the world and left it to the direction of  the fetishes; and still to this day people say, \"Ah, if it had not been  for that old woman, how happy we should be!\" However, after he had  withdrawn to heaven, the long-suffering deity sent a kind message by a  goat to men upon earth to say, \"There is something which they call  Death. He will kill some of you. But even if you die, you will not  perish completely. You will come to me in heaven.\" So off the goat set  with this cheering intelligence. But before he came to the town he saw a  tempting bush by the wayside and stopped to browse on it. When God in  heaven saw the goat thus loitering by the way, he sent off a sheep with  the same message to carry the glad tidings to men without delay. But the  sheep did not give the message aright. Far from it: he said, \"God sends  you word that you will die and that will be an end of you.\" Afterwards  the goat arrived on the scene and said, \"God sends you word that you  will die, certainly, but that will not be the end of you, for you will  go to him.\" But men said to the goat, \"No, goat, that is not what God  said. We believe that the message which the sheep brought us is the one  which God sent to us.\" That was the beginning of death among men.[65]  However, in another Ashantee version of the tale the parts played by the  sheep and the goat are reversed. It is the sheep who brings the tidings  of immortality from God to men, but the goat overruns him and offers  them death instead. Not knowing what death was, men accepted the seeming  boon with enthusiasm and have died ever since.[66]    [Sidenote: II. The story of the Waxing and Waning Moon. Hottentot story  of the Moon, the hare, and death.]    So much for the tale of the Two Messengers. In the last versions of it  which I have quoted, a feature to be noticed is the perversion of the  message by one of the messengers, who brings tidings of death instead of  life eternal to men. The same perversion of the message reappears in  some examples of the next type of story which I shall illustrate, namely  the type of the Waxing and Waning Moon. Thus the Namaquas or Hottentots  say that once the Moon charged the hare to go to men and say, \"As I die  and rise to life again, so shall you die and rise to life again.\" So the  hare went to men, but either out of forgetfulness or malice he reversed  the message and said, \"As I die and do not rise to life again, so you  shall also die and not rise to life again.\" Then he went back to the  Moon, and she asked him what he had said. He told her, and when she  heard how he had given the wrong message, she was so angry that she  threw a stick at him and split his lip, which is the reason why the  hare's lip is still split. So the hare ran away and is still running to  this day. Some people, however, say that before he fled he clawed the  Moon's face, which still bears the marks of the scratching, as anybody  may see for himself on a clear moonlight night. So the Hottentots are  still angry with the hare for bringing death into the world, and they  will not let initiated men partake of its flesh.[67] There are traces of  a similar story among the Bushmen.[68] In another Hottentot version two  messengers appear, an insect and a hare; the insect is charged by the  Moon with a message of immortality or rather of resurrection to men, but  the hare persuades the insect to let him bear the tidings, which he  perverts into a message of annihilation.[69] Thus in this particular  version the type of the Two Messengers coincides with the Moon type.    [Sidenote: Masai story of the moon and death.]    A story of the same type, though different in details, is told by the  Masai of East Africa. They say that in the early days a certain god  named Naiteru-kop told a man named Le-eyo that if a child were to die he  was to throw away the body and say, \"Man, die, and come back again;  moon, die, and remain away.\" Well, soon afterwards a child died, but it  was not one of the man's own children, so when he threw the body away he  said, \"Man, die, and remain away; moon, die, and return.\" Next one of  his own children died, and when he threw away the body he said, \"Man,  die, and return; moon, die, and remain away.\" But the god said to him,  \"It is of no use now, for you spoilt matters with the other child.\" That  is why down to this day when a man dies he returns no more, but when the  moon dies she always comes to life again.[70]    [Sidenote: Nandi story of the moon, the dog, and death.]    Another story of the origin of death which belongs to this type is told  by the Nandi of British East Africa. They say that when the first people  lived upon the earth a dog came to them one day and said: \"All people  will die like the moon, but unlike the moon you will not return to life  again unless you give me some milk to drink out of your gourd, and beer  to drink through your straw. If you do this, I will arrange for you to  go to the river when you die and to come to life again on the third  day.\" But the people laughed at the dog, and gave him some milk and beer  to drink off a stool. The dog was angry at not being served in the same  vessels as a human being, and though he put his pride in his pocket and  drank the milk and the beer from the stool, he went away in high  dudgeon, saying, \"All people will die, and the moon alone will return to  life.\" That is the reason why, when people die, they stay away, whereas  when the moon goes away she comes back again after three days'  absence.[71] The Wa-Sania of British East Africa believe that in days  gone by people never died, till one unlucky day a lizard came and said  to them, \"All of you know that the moon dies and rises again, but human  beings will die and rise no more.\" They say that from that day people  began to die and have persisted in dying ever since.[72]    [Sidenote: Fijian story of the moon, the rat, and death. Caroline  Islands story of the moon, death, and resurrection. Wotjobaluk story of  the moon, death, and resurrection. Cham story of the moon, death, and  resurrection.]    With these African stories of the origin of death we may compare one  told by the Fijians on the other side of the world. They say that once  upon a time the Moon contended that men should be like himself (for the  Fijian moon seems to be a male); that is, he meant that just as he grows  old, disappears, and comes in sight again, so men grown old should  vanish for a while and then return to life. But the rat, who is a Fijian  god, would not hear of it. \"No,\" said he, \"let men die like rats.\" And  he had the best of it in the dispute, for men die like rats to this  day.[73] In the Caroline Islands they say that long, long ago death was  unknown, or rather it was a short sleep, not a long, long one, as it is  now. Men died on the last day of the waning moon and came to life again  on the first appearance of the new moon, just as if they had awakened  from a refreshing slumber. But an evil spirit somehow contrived that  when men slept the sleep of death they should wake no more.[74] The  Wotjobaluk of south-eastern Australia relate that, when all animals were  men and women, some of them died and the moon used to say, \"You  up-again,\" whereupon they came to life again. But once on a time an old  man said, \"Let them remain dead\"; and since then nobody has ever come to  life again except the moon, which still continues to do so down to this  very day.[75] The Chams of Annam and Cambodia say that the goddess of  good luck used to resuscitate people as fast as they died, till the  sky-god, tired of her constant interference with the laws of nature,  transferred her to the moon, where it is no longer in her power to bring  the dead to life again.[76]    [Sidenote: Cycle of death and resurrection after three days, like the  monthly disappearance and reappearance of the moon.]    These stories which associate human immortality with the moon are  products of a primitive philosophy which, meditating on the visible  changes, of the lunar orb, drew from the observation of its waning and  waxing a dim notion that under a happier fate man might have been  immortal like the moon, or "]]]
