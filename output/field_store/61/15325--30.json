Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#20)"],[1,"bring no blessing on them that spoke it;\" which  being translated into plain English, meant, \"If you trouble me, I will  overlook (i. e. fascinate) you, and then your pigs will die, your horses  stray, your cream turn sour, your barns be fired, your son have St.  Vitus's dance, your daughter fits, and so on, woe on woe, till you are  very probably starved to death in a ditch, by virtue of this terrible  little eye of mine, at which, in spite of all your swearing and  bullying, you know you are now shaking in your shoes for fear. So you  had much better hold your tongue, give me a drink of cider, and leave  ill alone, lest you make it worse.\"    Not that Lucy ever proceeded to any such fearful extremities. On the  contrary, her boast, and her belief too, was, that she was sent into  the world to make poor souls as happy as she could, by lawful means,  of course, if possible, but if not--why, unlawful ones were better than  none; for she \"couldn't a-bear to see the poor creatures taking on;  she was too, too tender-hearted.\" And so she was, to every one but her  husband, a tall, simple-hearted rabbit-faced man, a good deal older than  herself. Fully agreeing with Sir Richard Grenville's great axiom,  that he who cannot obey cannot rule, Lucy had been for the last  five-and-twenty years training him pretty smartly to obey her, with the  intention, it is to be charitably hoped, of letting him rule her in  turn when his lesson was perfected. He bore his honors, however, meekly  enough, having a boundless respect for his wife's wisdom, and a firm  belief in her supernatural powers, and let her go her own way and earn  her own money, while he got a little more in a truly pastoral method  (not extinct yet along those lonely cliffs), by feeding a herd of some  dozen donkeys and twenty goats. The donkeys fetched, at each low-tide,  white shell-sand which was to be sold for manure to the neighboring  farmers; the goats furnished milk and \"kiddy-pies;\" and when there was  neither milking nor sand-carrying to be done, old Will Passmore just  sat under a sunny rock and watched the buck-goats rattle their horns  together, thinking about nothing at all, and taking very good care  all the while neither to inquire nor to see who came in and out of his  little cottage in the glen.    The prophetess, when Rose approached her oracular cave, was seated on  a tripod in front of the fire, distilling strong waters out of  penny-royal. But no sooner did her distinguished visitor appear at the  hatch, than the still was left to take care of itself, and a clean  apron and mutch having been slipt on, Lucy welcomed Rose with endless  courtesies, and--\"Bless my dear soul alive, who ever would have thought  to see the Rose of Torridge to my poor little place!\"    Rose sat down: and then? How to begin was more than she knew, and she  stayed silent a full five minutes, looking earnestly at the point of  her shoe, till Lucy, who was an adept in such cases, thought it best  to proceed to business at once, and save Rose the delicate operation  of opening the ball herself; and so, in her own way, half fawning, half  familiar--    \"Well, my dear young lady, and what is it I can do for ye? For I guess  you want a bit of old Lucy's help, eh? Though I'm most mazed to see ye  here, surely. I should have supposed that pretty face could manage they  sort of matters for itself. Eh?\"    Rose, thus bluntly charged, confessed at once, and with many blushes and  hesitations, made her soon understand that what she wanted was \"To have  her fortune told.\"    \"Eh? Oh! I see. The pretty face has managed it a bit too well already,  eh? Tu many o' mun, pure fellows? Well, 'tain't every mayden has her  pick and choose, like some I know of, as be blest in love by stars  above. So you hain't made up your mind, then?\"    Rose shook her head.    \"Ah--well,\" she went on, in a half-bantering tone. \"Not so asy, is it,  then? One's gude for one thing, and one for another, eh? One has the  blood, and another the money.\"    And so the \"cunning woman\" (as she truly was), talking half to herself,  ran over all the names which she thought likely, peering at Rose all the  while out of the corners of her foxy bright eyes, while Rose stirred the  peat ashes steadfastly with the point of her little shoe, half angry,  half ashamed, half frightened, to find that \"the cunning woman\" had  guessed so well both her suitors and her thoughts about them, and tried  to look unconcerned at each name as it came out.    \"Well, well,\" said Lucy, who took nothing by her move, simply because  there was nothing to take; \"think over it--think over it, my dear life;  and if you did set your mind on any one--why, then--then maybe I might  help you to a sight of him.\"    \"A sight of him?\"    \"His sperrit, dear life, his sperrit only, I mane. I 'udn't have no  keeping company in my house, no, not for gowld untowld, I 'udn't; but  the sperrit of mun--to see whether mun would be true or not, you'd like  to know that, now, 'udn't you, my darling?\"    Rose sighed, and stirred the ashes about vehemently.    \"I must first know who it is to be. If you could show me that--now--\"    \"Oh, I can show ye that, tu, I can. Ben there's a way to 't, a sure way;  but 'tis mortal cold for the time o' year, you zee.\"    \"But what is it, then?\" said Rose, who had in her heart been longing for  something of that very kind, and had half made up her mind to ask for a  charm.    \"Why, you'm not afraid to goo into the say by night for a minute, are  you? And to-morrow night would serve, too; 't will be just low tide to  midnight.\"    \"If you would come with me perhaps--\"    \"I'll come, I'll come, and stand within call, to be sure. Only do ye  mind this, dear soul alive, not to goo telling a crumb about mun, noo,  not for the world, or yu'll see naught at all, indeed, now. And beside,  there's a noxious business grow'd up against me up to Chapel there; and  I hear tell how Mr. Leigh saith I shall to Exeter gaol for a witch--did  ye ever hear the likes?--because his groom Jan saith I overlooked  mun--the Papist dog! And now never he nor th' owld Father Francis goo by  me without a spetting, and saying of their Ayes and Malificas--I do  know what their Rooman Latin do mane, zo well as ever they, I du!--and a  making o' their charms and incantations to their saints and idols! They  be mortal feared of witches, they Papists, and mortal hard on 'em, even  on a pure body like me, that doth a bit in the white way; 'case why you  see, dear life,\" said she, with one of her humorous twinkles, \"tu to a  trade do never agree. Do ye try my bit of a charm, now; do ye!\"    Rose could not resist the temptation; and between them both the charm  was agreed on, and the next night was fixed for its trial, on the  payment of certain current coins of the realm (for Lucy, of course,  must live by her trade); and slipping a tester into the dame's hand as  earnest, Rose went away home, and got there in safety.    But in the meanwhile, at the very hour that Eustace had been prosecuting  his suit in the lane at Moorwinstow, a very different scene was being  enacted in Mrs. Leigh's room at Burrough.    For the night before, Amyas, as he was going to bed, heard his brother  Frank in the next room tune his lute, and then begin to sing. And  both their windows being open, and only a thin partition between the  chambers, Amyas's admiring ears came in for every word of the following  canzonet, sung in that delicate and mellow tenor voice for which Frank  was famed among all fair ladies:--          \"Ah, tyrant Love, Megaera's serpents bearing,       Why thus requite my sighs with venom'd smart?         Ah, ruthless dove, the vulture's talons wearing,       Why flesh them, traitress, in this faithful heart?         Is this my meed?  Must dragons' teeth alone         In Venus' lawns by lovers' hands be sown?          \"Nay, gentlest Cupid; 'twas my pride undid me.       Nay, guiltless dove; by mine own wound I fell.         To worship, not to wed, Celestials bid me:       I dreamt to mate in heaven, and wake in hell;         Forever doom'd, Ixion-like, to reel         On mine own passions' ever-burning wheel.\"    At which the simple sailor sighed, and longed that he could write such  neat verses, and sing them so sweetly. How he would besiege the ear  of Rose Salterne with amorous ditties! But still, he could not be  everything; and if he had the bone and muscle of the family, it was but  fair that Frank should have the brains and voice; and, after all, he was  bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, and it was just the same as  if he himself could do all the fine things which Frank could do; for as  long as one of the family won honor, what matter which of them it was?  Whereon he shouted through the wall, \"Good night, old song-thrush; I  suppose I need not pay the musicians.\"    \"What, awake?\" answered Frank. \"Come in here, and lull me to sleep with  a sea-song.\"    So Amyas went in, and found Frank laid on the outside of his bed not yet  undrest.    \"I am a bad sleeper,\" said he; \"I spend more time, I fear, in burning  the midnight oil than prudent men should. Come and be my jongleur,  my minnesinger, and tell me about Andes, and cannibals, and the  ice-regions, and the fire-regions, and the paradises of the West.\"    So Amyas sat down, and told: but somehow, every story which he tried to  tell came round, by crooked paths, yet sure, to none other point than  Rose Salterne, and how he thought of her here and thought of her there,  and how he wondered what she would say if she had seen him in this  adventure, and how he longed to have had her with him to show her that  glorious sight, till Frank let him have his own way, and then out came  the whole story of the simple fellow's daily and hourly devotion to her,  through those three long years of world-wide wanderings.    \"And oh, Frank, I could hardly think of anything but her in the church  the other day, God "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#20)"],[1,"to the dark-skinned chauffeur, upon whom I directed my  glasses.    As the girl alighted and spoke to him for a moment, he raised the  goggles which habitually he wore and I saw his face. A theory which I  had formed on the previous night proved correct. The chauffeur was the  Hindu, Chunda Lal! As Zara el-Khala walked up the steps he backed  the car into the narrow lane and I watched him constantly. Yet, watch  as closely as I might, I could not see where he concealed himself in  order to command a view of the road.    On this occasion, as I know, Dr. Stuart was at home. Nevertheless, the  girl stayed for close upon half an hour, and I began to wonder if some  new move had been planned. Suddenly the door opened and she came out.    I crept through the bushes to my bicycle and wheeled it on to the  drive. I saw the car start; but Madame Fortune being in playful mood,  my own engine refused to start at all, and when ten minutes later I  at last aroused a spark of life in the torpid machine I knew that  pursuit would be futile.    Since this record is intended for the guidance of those who take up  the quest of \"The Scorpion\" either in co-operation with myself or,  in the event of my failure, alone, it would be profitless for me to  record my disasters. Very well, I had one success. One night I pursued  the yellow car from Dr. Stuart's house to the end of Limehouse  Causeway without once losing sight of it.    A string of lorries form the docks, drawn by a traction engine, checked  me at the corner for a time, although the yellow car passed. But I  raced furiously on and by great good luck overtook it near the Dock  Station. From thence onward pursuing a strangely tortuous route, I  kept it in sight to Canning Town, when it turned into a public garage.  I followed--to purchase petrol.    Chunda Lal was talking to the man in charge; he had not yet left his  seat. But the car was empty!    At first I was stupid with astonishment. _Par la barbe du prophete!_ I  was astounded. Then I saw that I had really made a great discovery.  The street into which I had injudiciously followed \"Le Balafre\" lay  between Limehouse Causeway and Ropemaker Street, and it was at no great  distance from this point that I had lost sight of the yellow car. In  that street, which according to my friend the policeman was \"nearly  all Chinese,\" Zara el-Khala had descended; in that street was \"The  Scorpion's\" lair!          CHAPTER V    CONCLUSION OF STATEMENT      I come now to the conclusion of this statement and to the strange  occurrence which led to my proclaiming myself. The fear of imminent  assassination which first had prompted me to record what I knew of  \"The Scorpion\" had left me since I had ceased to be Charles Malet. And  that the disappearance of \"Le Balafre\" had been accepted by his  unknown chief as evidence of his success in removing _me_, I did not  doubt. Therefore I breathed more freely ... and more freely still when  my body was recovered!    Yes, my body was recovered from Hanover Hole; I read of it--a very  short paragraph, but it is the short paragraphs that matter--in my  morning paper. I knew then that I should very shortly be dead indeed--  officially dead. I had counted on this happening before, you  understand, for I more than ever suspected that \"The Scorpion\" knew me  to be in England and I feared that he would \"lie low\" as the English  say. However, since a fortunate thing happens better late than never,  I say in this paragraph two things: (1) that the enemy would cease to  count upon Gaston Max; (2) that the Scotland Yard Commissioner would  be authorised to open Part First of this Statement which had been  lodged at his office two days after I landed in England--the portion  dealing with my inquiries in Paris and with my tracking of \"Le  Balafre\" to Bow Road Station and observing that he showed a golden  scorpion to the chauffeur of the yellow car.    This would happen because Paris would wire that the identification  disk found on the dead man was that of Gaston Max. Why would Paris do  so? Because my reports had been discounted since I had ceased to be  Charles Malet and Paris would be seeking evidence of my whereabouts.  My reports had discontinued because I had learned that I had to do  with a criminal organization of whose ramifications I knew nothing.  Therefore I took no more chances. I died.    I return to the night when Inspector Dunbar, the grim Dunbar of  Scotland Yard, came to Dr. Stuart's house. His appearance there  puzzled me. I could not fail to recognize him, for as dusk had fully  come I had descended from my top window and was posted among the  bushes of the empty house from whence I commanded a perfect view of  the doctor's door. The night was unusually chilly--there had been some  rain--and when I crept around to the lane bordering the lawn, hoping  to see or hear something of what was taking place in the study, I  found that the windows were closed and the blinds drawn.    Luck seemed to have turned against me; for that night, at dusk, when I  had gone to a local garage where I kept my motor bicycle, I had  discovered the back tire to be perfectly flat and had been forced to  contain my soul in patience whilst the man repaired a serious puncture.  The result was of course that for more than half an hour I had not had  Dr. Stuart's house under observation. And a hundred and one things  can happen in half an hour.    Had Dr. Stuart sent for the Inspector? If so, I feared that the  envelope was missing, or at any rate that he had detected Zara  el-Khala in the act of stealing it and had determined to place the  matter in the hands of the police. It was a maddening reflection.  Again--I shrewdly suspected that I was not the only watcher of Dr.  Stuart's house. The frequency with which the big yellow car drew up  at the door a few moments after the doctor had gone out could not be  due to accident. Yet I had been unable to detect the presence of this  other watcher, nor had I any idea of the spot where the car remained  hidden--if my theory was a correct one. Nevertheless I did not expect  to see it come along whilst the Inspector remained at the house--  always supposing that Zara el-Khala  had not yet succeeded. I  wheeled out the \"Indian\" and rode to a certain tobacconist's shop at  which I had sometimes purchased cigarettes.    He had a telephone in a room at the rear which customers were allowed  to use on payment of a fee, and a public call-box would not serve my  purpose, since the operator usually announces to a subscriber the fact  that a call emanated from such an office. The shop was closed, but I  rang the bell at the side door and obtained permission to use the  telephone upon pleading urgency. I had assiduously cultivated a natural  gift for mimicry, having found it of inestimable service in the  practice of my profession. It served me now. I had worked in the past  with Inspector Dunbar and his subordinate Sergeant Sowerby, and I  determined to trust to my memory of the latter's mode of speech.    I rang up Dr. Stuart and asked for the Inspector, saying Sergeant  Sowerby spoke from Scotland Yard. \"Hullo!\" he cried, \"is that you,  Sowerby?\"    \"Yes,\" I replied in Sowerby's voice. \"I thought I should find you  there. About the body of Max..\"    \"Eh!\" said Dunbar--\"what's that? Max?\"    I knew immediately that Paris had not yet wired, therefore I told him  that Paris _had_ done so, and that the disk numbered 49685 was that of  Gaston Max. He was inexpressibly shocked, deploring the rashness of  Max in working alone.    \"Come to Scotland Yard,\" I said, anxious to get him away from the house.    He said he would be with me in a few minutes, and I was racking my  brains for some means of learning what business had taken him to Dr.  Stuart when he gave me the desired information spontaneously.    \"Sowerby, listen,\" said he: \"It's 'The Scorpion' case right enough!  That bit of gold found on the dead man is not a cactus stem; it's a  scorpion's tail!\"    So! they had found what I had failed to find! It must have been  attached, I concluded, to some inner part of \"Le Balafre's\" clothing.  There had been no mention of Zara el-Khala; therefore, as I rode  back to my post I permitted myself to assume that she would come  again, since presumably she had thus far failed. I was right.    _Morbleu!_ quick as I was the car was there before me! But I had not  overlooked this possibility and I had dismounted at a good distance  from the house and had left the \"Indian\" in someone's front garden.  As I had turned out of the main road I had seen Dr. Stuart and  Inspector Dunbar approaching a rank upon which two or three cabs  usually stood.    I watched _la Bell_ Zara enter the house, a beautiful woman most  elegantly attired, and then, even before Chunda Lal had backed the  car into the lane I was off ... to the spot at which I had abandoned  my motor bicycle. In little more than half an hour I had traversed  London, and was standing in the shadow of that high, blank wall to  which I have referred as facing a row of wooden houses in a certain  street adjoining Limehouse Causeway.    You perceive my plan? I was practically sure of the street; all I had  to learn was which house sheltered \"The Scorpion\"!    I had already suspected that this night was to be for me an unlucky  night. _Nom d'un p'tit bon-homme!_ it was so. Until an hour before dawn  I crouched under that wall and saw no living thing except a very old  Chinaman who came out of one of the houses and walked slowly away.  The other houses appeared to be empty. No vehicle of any kind passed  that way all night.    Turning over in my mind the details of this most perplexing case, it  became evident to me that the advantages of working alone were now  outweighed by the disadvantages. The affair had reached a stage at  which ordinary police methods should be put into operation. I had  collected some of the threads; the next thing"]]]
