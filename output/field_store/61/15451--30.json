You see if I get you any more cheap neckties.  I'm  always ashamed, as it is, to ask for ninepenny sailor's knots and one-  and-twopenny kid gloves at the shop.\"    \"Tell the truth--they're one-and-three.  I suppose you get one-and-  twopenny and pocket the odd penny!\"    This pleasant recrimination might have proceeded I know not how long,  greatly to the detriment of my task, had not some one at the other desk  changed the subject.    \"Don't you fret, you there,\" said he, \"the junior's not for you at all.  He's for the imports.  I told the governor we wanted a boy in our  department last week.\"    \"You did!\" exclaimed Doubleday.  \"Why, I told him we couldn't possibly  do without more help here in the exports a fortnight ago.\"    I don't know if any one saw my face when this glorious announcement was  made.  I could have danced on my desk for joy!  Just suppose--suppose it  should turn out that Jack Smith should be taken on in the export  department and I in the import--or the other way round!  I could hardly  contain myself at the bare idea.  Wouldn't I be glad!  I would get  Wallop one-and-fourpenny gloves and only charge him one-and-three for  them, to signalise the joyous event.  I would let myself out as a slave  to the entire office, if only Jack Smith and I were both taken on!  How  was he getting on in the partners' room?  I wondered.  I hoped--    \"I suppose you've done,\" said Doubleday, looking round at this point;  \"if so you can hook it.\"    \"I haven't quite,\" said I, dashing back to my work.    I finished at last, and before Jack had come out of the inner-room too.    I handed my papers to Doubleday, who looked at them critically.    \"Well,\" he said, \"that's a pretty show.  Have a look at this, Wallop, I  say.  Your youngest grandchild could make his sevens nearly as well as  that!\"    As Mr Wallop was about eighteen years old, I ventured to regard this  language as figurative on the part of Mr Doubleday, and trusted the  sevens were not quite as bad as he made out.    \"All right,\" said Doubleday, \"you can cut home to your mother-in-law.  You'll probably hear no more about it.  There's millions of other  loafers after the berth.\"    \"When will I know?\"  I faltered.    \"Let's see, this is the nineteenth century, ain't it?  Call again about  the year two thousand.  February the thirty-first's the most convenient  day for us, we're all at home then.  Ta-ta.\"    I departed rather disconsolately, and waited half an hour outside in the  street for Smith.    \"Well,\" said I, when presently he appeared, \"how did you get on?\"    \"Not very grand,\" said he.  \"I had to do some accounts like you.  I  heard one of the partners say yours were pretty good when the clerk  brought them in.\"    \"Really?\" cried I, with pleasure I could hardly disguise.  \"But, I say,  Jack, unless you get on too, it'll be an awful sell.\"    \"We can't both get on,\" said Jack.    \"I don't know,\" said I.  And I related what I had overheard in the  counting-house.    Smith brightened up at this.  A very little encouragement was enough to  set us building castles in the air.  And we did build castles in the air  that morning as we paced the crowded city streets.    By the time these architectural exercises were over it was time for me  to go back to the station and catch my train; but not before I had tried  to extract from Jack what he had been doing with himself since he was  expelled from Stonebridge House.    As before, he was very uncommunicative.  All I heard was that the reason  he didn't get my letters at Packworth was that he had told me, or  thought he had told me, to address my letters to \"T,\" and I had always  addressed them to \"J.\"  But even had I addressed them correctly, he  would only have received the first, as a fortnight after he left  Stonebridge he went to London, where he had hitherto been working as a  grocer's shop-boy.  You should have seen the look of disgust with which  he referred to this part of his life!  But now, having seen Merrett,  Barnacle, and Company's advertisement, he was applying for their  situation.    But in all his story he would tell me nothing about his home, or his  relatives, so that as to knowing who my friend Smith was, or where he  came from, I went back that afternoon to Brownstroke as much in the dark  as ever.  But I had found _him_!        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    HOW MY FRIEND SMITH AND I ENTERED ON NEW DUTIES IN NEW COMPANY.    The two days which followed my eventful expedition to London were among  the most anxious I ever spent.  Young and unsophisticated as I was, I  knew quite enough of my own affairs to feel that a crisis in my life had  been reached, and that a great deal, nay, everything, depended on how my  application for Merrett, Barnacle, and Company's situation turned out.  If I succeeded there, I should have made a start in life--modest enough,  truly, but a start all the same--and who was to say whether from the  bottom of the ladder I might not some day and somehow get to the top?  But if I missed, I knew full well my uncle would take my affairs into  his own hands, and probably put me to work which would be distasteful,  and in which I should be miserable.  So you see, reader, I had a good  deal staked on my little venture.    The miserable thing was that I might never hear at all from the firm,  but go on hoping against hope, day after day, in a suspense which would  be worse than knowing straight off that I had failed.  However, I kept  up appearances before my uncle, for I didn't want him to think it was no  use waiting a little before he took me in hand himself.  I spent several  hours a day working up my arithmetic, making out imaginary invoices  against every imaginable person, and generally preparing myself for  office work.  And the rest of my time I spent in cogitation and  speculation as to my future destiny, and the merits and demerits of  those enviable mortals, Doubleday, Wallop, and Crow, of the Export  Department of Messrs. Merrett, Barnacle, and Company.    On Tuesday morning two letters came for me with the London postmark, one  in Jack Smith's well-remembered handwriting, the other with the awful  initials, \"M., B., and Company,\" on the seal.    I opened Smith's letter first.  It was very short.    \"Dear Fred,--I hear to-day I have got the situation.  I'm afraid that  means you have missed it.  I'm awfully sorry, old boy, that's all I can  say.  I hope in any case you will come to London.  I'll write again.  Ever yours,--Jack.\"    I flung down the letter in a whirl of mingled feelings.  That Jack Smith  had got the situation I could not help being glad.  But that I had lost  it was simply crushing.  Although I had kept reminding myself all along  in words that the chances were very remote, I yet discovered how I had  at heart been reckoning on my success almost to a certainty.  And now I  was utterly floored.    All this was the first hurried impression caused on my mind by my friend  Smith's letter; and for a minute I quite forgot, in my mortification,  that I had in my hand another letter--a letter from Merrett, Barnacle,  and Company themselves.  Then suddenly remembering it, I called to mind  also the vague rumour of two clerks being wanted in the office, and with  new hope and wild anxiety I tore open the envelope.    Could I believe my eyes?    \"Frederick Batchelor is informed that his application for junior  clerkship is successful.  He will be required to begin work on Monday  next at 9 a.m.\"    For the space of two minutes, reader, I knew not if I was standing on my  head or my feet.  I will pass over the excited day or two which  followed.  My uncle, of course, did what he could to check my glee.  He  said Merrett, Barnacle, and Company must be easily pleased, but they  would soon find out their mistake, and that I might as well make up my  mind to be dismissed after the first fortnight, and so on.  I didn't  take it much to heart; and after the first gush did not trouble my  relative much with my prospects.    I was, however, a little curious to know what proposal he would make  about my board and lodging in the great metropolis, which, after all,  was a matter of some little consequence to me.    He did not see fit to relieve my anxiety on this point until the very  eve of my departure from Brownstroke, when he said, abruptly, \"You will  be gone before I'm down to-morrow, Frederick.  Don't forget the train  starts at two minutes before six.  I have arranged for you to lodge with  Mrs Nash, whose address is on this card.  There will be time to take  your trunk round there before you go to your work.  For the present I  shall pay for your lodging.\"    \"Shall I get my meals there?\"  I ventured to ask.    \"Eh!  You must arrange about that sort of thing yourself; and take my  advice, and don't be extravagant.\"    As my salary was to be eight shillings a week, there wasn't much chance  of my eating my head off, in addition to providing myself decently with  the ordinary necessaries of life.    \"I say I shall pay your lodging for the present, but before long I  expect you to support yourself entirely.  I cannot afford it,  Frederick.\"    It had never occurred to me before that I cost anything to keep, but the  fact was slowly beginning to dawn on me, and the prospect of having  shortly to support myself cast rather a damper over the pictures I had  drawn to myself of my pleasant life in London.    \"Good-bye,\" said my uncle.  \"Here is half-a-sovereign for you, which  remember is on no account to be spent.  Keep it by you, and don't part  with it.  Good-night.\"    And so my uncle and I parted.

We must certainly polish up our recollection of what we  read, for it is not at all difficult to imagine circumstances in which  the knowledge may be of vital import to us.  By the way, Mafuta, tell  those fellows that they are dismissed, and that all we shall require of  them to-morrow, in addition to the oxen, will be a guide.\"    Oxen and guide were both duly forthcoming on the morrow: the journey  toward what may be called the capital was resumed, and continued day  after day without adventure, the guide supplied on the first day  continuing with the party for the whole of that day, and then turning  them over to another, who in like manner piloted them a day's trek, in  turn to pass them on to another, and so on, day after day; each guide  returning to his starting-point on the following day.        CHAPTER EIGHT.    KING LOBELALATUTU.    The one thing that, after the spreading, well-tilled fields surrounding  every village, the great herds of cattle, and the general aspect of  prosperity everywhere met with, most impressed the two travellers during  their progress through the Makolo country, was the extraordinary  courtesy and deference uniformly extended to them by the natives.  These  people were savages, pure and unadulterated, a fierce and warlike race,  who had been obliged to fight for their very existence throughout  countless ages, ignorant and superstitious to a degree, with all the  virtues and most of the vices of the primeval savage, unspeakably cruel  and relentless as enemies, absolutely fearless in battle, and, above  all, intensely suspicious of strangers; yet, although white men were  practically unknown to them as a people, they never annoyed the  travellers by any display of undue curiosity, every man deferentially  saluted them, and all were willing, even eager, to do them service.    The character of the country, although it could not by any stretch of  the imagination be described as mountainous, maintained its rugged  character almost to the end of the journey, consisting of a constant  succession of low hills, or ridges, mostly of granite formation, divided  from each other by broad, fertile, well-watered valleys, dotted here and  there with villages which, as the travellers advanced, gradually drew  closer together and increased in importance.    It was as the travellers surmounted a certain ridge, about an hour and a  half before the time of their midday halt, that they caught their first  glimpse of the sea since losing sight of it on their departure from  Lourenco Marques.  It stretched away to right and left and in front of  them, a narrow, faint, grey streak, softly shimmering under the beams of  the noontide sun; and between it and the observers lay a wide-  stretching, level, grassy plain, in the midst of which appeared  numberless irregularities that, viewed through their powerful glasses,  assumed the aspect of architectural ruins of enormous massiveness and  strength.  But they were some ten miles distant, and through the highly  rarefied atmosphere that intervened it was impossible to obtain any very  clear conception of their character, except that they were undoubtedly  of human origin and of quite unexpected extent.  One thing, however, was  certain, in the light of Menzies' story, as recounted to them by his and  their friend Mitchell, those enormous ruins could be none other than the  remains of the ancient Ophir mentioned in Holy Writ; and the two friends  sent up a shout of irrepressible exultation at the thought that they had  advanced thus far upon their difficult journey without mishap of any  kind.  They were now all eagerness and impatience to reach those  wonderful ruins; but the oxen were tired and hungry, having already been  trekking for more than two hours; moreover, they took no interest in  archaeology, and preferred an acre of rich grass to the finest ruins in  the world, therefore it became imperative to outspan as soon as the  wagon had plunged down into the plain far enough to reach the first  watercourse.  But Grosvenor and Maitland were not long in arriving at  the decision to saddle up and ride forward as soon as they had partaken  of a hasty tiffin.    This resolution they duly carried into effect, observing the precaution  to slip their loaded revolvers into their belts and to sling their  loaded rifles and fully charged bandoliers over their shoulders, to  guard against the possibility of accident, although they had thus far  seen nothing to justify the slightest suspicion that either the king or  his people meditated treachery.  As they rode they had ample opportunity  to observe--as indeed had been the case ever since they entered the  Makolo country--the operation of the curious voice-telegraph system  practised by the natives in their communications with each other, the  high-pitched messages--doubtless reporting their progress-breaching  their ears at frequent intervals.    They advanced at an easy canter, heading straight for the ruins, for  there was no semblance of a road, or even of a footpath, and scarcely  any people were to be seen, except in and about the villages which they  occasionally passed.  But when they had arrived within about three miles  of the ruins they observed, approaching them round the spur of a low  hill, a troop of about fifty horsemen, which their field glasses enabled  them to perceive were splendidly mounted, and garbed in the full panoply  of war, consisting of shield, war axe, sheaf of broad-bladed spears,  plumed head-dress, and--in the case of the leader--leopard-skin mantle,  and necklace of leopards' claws.  It was a distinctly formidable  cavalcade for two men only to meet, even although the latter were armed  with weapons of such deadly precision as the rifle and revolver; and for  a minute or two the travellers were just a little uncertain as to how to  meet the situation.  Finally they reined in and came to a halt,  whereupon the leader of the troop threw up his right hand, as though  giving an order, upon which his followers, who had been advancing at a  gallop, reined their horses back upon their haunches, coming to an  abrupt halt, while he, reducing his pace to a hand-gallop, continued his  advance alone.    \"All right, old chap, come along,\" exclaimed Grosvenor; \"those fellows  mean us no harm, I am sure.  I expect it is a detachment sent out by the  king to bid us welcome on our approach to his village.\"    \"Very possibly,\" assented Dick.  \"But, having halted, we must now remain  where we are until that fellow approaches and delivers his message.  To  resume our journey at this moment would be tantamount to an admission of  distrust on our part, which would never do.  No, no; let the man come to  us, not we go to him.  Among savages, you know, first impressions count  for a good deal, and it would never do to let those fellow think that we  halted because we were nervous.\"    \"No, of course; you are quite right, it would not,\" agreed Grosvenor;  and sitting straight up in their saddles, and assuming an air of  absolute confidence which somewhat belied their inward feelings, they  patiently awaited the arrival of the solitary horseman.    In less than a minute he had arrived--a fine, stalwart man, of about  middle age, clean-limbed, broad chested, upright as a dart, of dauntless  aspect; his limbs and body showing many scars of battle.  As he reached  a point some ten feet from where the two white travellers awaited him he  abruptly reined his horse to a standstill, and threw up his right hand  in salute.    \"_'Nkosi_,\" he cried, in a full, deep, resonant tone of voice,  \"Lobelalatutu, the King of the Makolo, salutes you by the mouth of me,  'Mpandula, and bids you welcome to his royal village.  Behold a squadron  of his royal guard, which he has dispatched, under my command, to  conduct you in all honour to his presence.  He awaits you now in his  palace.  Does it please my lords that the squadron, approach to give  them the salute?\"    Now, this speech was only very imperfectly understood by those to whom  it was addressed; a word or two here and there they comprehended because  of their similarity to those in the language spoken by Mafuta; the name  of the king also they recognised; and 'Mpandula's gestures and the tones  of his voice also told them a little.  Thus in one way and another they  contrived to gain a sort of hazy general notion of the gist of the  chiefs speech.  But how were they to reply to it, and what were they to  say?  So early a summons to the king's presence was rather unexpected,  and, in the absence of Mafuta, who was behind, with the wagon, would be  rather embarrassing; for how were they to converse with the king without  the assistance of an interpreter?  There was but one thing to be done,  and that was to reply to the best of their ability, which Dick undertook  to do in the only native tongue with which he was familiar, explaining  as well as he could the difficulty in which the pair found themselves.    It was evident at once, by the puzzled expression on the chiefs face,  that he understood Dick as little as Dick understood him; and for a  moment there seemed to be the possibility of a deadlock.  But suddenly  'Mpandula's brow cleared, he turned on his horse and shouted a name, in  response to which one of the guards drove his heels into his horse's  flanks, and dashed forward to his chiefs assistance.  The latter  appeared to explain the position in a few terse words, and when he had  finished, the newcomer, at 'Mpandula's dictation, repeated the message  of the king, word for wood, in the language with which Dick was  familiar.    \"What do you say, Phil,\" questioned Dick, when the message was  concluded; \"shall we go?  Or shall we excuse ourselves for the present,  upon the plea that we would prefer to wait until the wagon comes up, in  order that we may take with us the gifts that"]]]
