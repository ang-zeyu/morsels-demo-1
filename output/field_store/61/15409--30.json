In her fanciful robe of old gold, with her tiny feet shod in  ridiculously small, gilt slippers, she stood by the screen watching  the stupefied man--an exquisite, fragrantly youthful casket of ancient,  unnameable evils.    \"Good evening, Soames!\" she said, stumbling quaintly with her English,  but speaking in a voice musical as a silver bell. \"You will here be  known as Lucas. Mr. King he wishing me to say that you to receive two  pounds, at each week.\"...    Soames, glassy-eyed, stood watching her. A horror, the horror of  insanity, had descended upon him--a clammy, rose-scented mantle. The  room, the incredible, book-lined room, was a red blur, surrounding the  black, taunting eyes of the Eurasian. Everything was out of focus; past,  present, and future were merged into a red, rose-haunted nothingness...    \"You will attend to Block A,\" resumed the girl, pointing at him with a  little fan. \"You will also attend to the gentlemen.\"...    She laughed softly, revealing tiny white teeth; then paused, head tilted  coquettishly, and appeared to be listening to someone's conversation--to  the words of some person seated behind the screen. This fact broke in  upon Soames' disordered mind and confirmed him in his opinion that he  was a man demented. For only one slight sound broke the silence of the  room. The red carpet below the little tables was littered with  rose petals, and, in the super-heated atmosphere, other petals kept  falling--softly, with a gentle rustling. Just that sound there was...  and no other. Then:    \"Mr. King he wishing to point out to you,\" said the girl, \"that he hold  receipts of you, which bind you to him. So you will be free man, and  have liberty to go out sometimes for your own business. Mr. King he  wishing to hear you say you thinking to agree with the conditions and be  satisfied.\"    She ceased speaking, but continued to smile; and so complete was the  stillness, that Soames, whose sense of hearing had become nervously  stimulated, heard a solitary rose petal fall upon the corner of the  writing-table.    \"I... agree,\" he whispered huskily; \"and... I am... satisfied.\"    He looked at the carven screen as a lost soul might look at the gate of  Hades; he felt now that if a sound should come from beyond it he would  shriek out, he would stop up his ears; that if the figure of the Unseen  should become visible, he must die at the first glimpse of it.    The little brown girl was repeating the uncanny business of listening  to that voice of silence; and Soames knew that he could not sustain his  part in this eerie comedy for another half-minute without breaking out  into hysterical laughter. Then:    \"Mr. King he releasing you for to-night,\" announced the silver bell  voice.    The light went out.    Soames uttered a groan of terror, followed by a short, bubbling laugh,  but was seized firmly by the arm and led on into the blackness--on  through the solid, book-laden walls, presumably; and on--on--on, along  those interminable passages by which he had come. Here the air was  cooler, and the odor of roses no longer perceptible, no longer stifling  him, no longer assailing his nostrils, not as an odor of sweetness, but  as a perfume utterly damnable and unholy.    With his knees trembling at every step, he marched on, firmly supported  by his unseen companion.    \"Stop!\" directed a metallic, guttural voice.    Soames pulled up, and leaned weakly against the wall. He heard the clap  of hands close behind him; and a door opened within twelve inches of the  spot whereat he stood.    He tottered out into the matting-lined corridor from which he had  started upon that nightmare journey; Ho-Pin appeared at his elbow, but  no door appeared behind Ho-Pin!    \"This is your wroom,\" said the Chinaman, revealing his yellow teeth in a  mirthless smile.    He walked across the corridor, threw open a door--a real, palpable  door... and there was Soames' little white room!    Soames staggered across, for it seemed a veritable haven of  refuge--entered, and dropped upon the bed. He seemed to see the  rose-petals fall--fall--falling in that red room in the labyrinth--the  room that had no door; he seemed to see the laughing eyes of the  beautiful Eurasian.    \"Good night!\" came the metallic voice of Ho-Pin.    The light in the corridor went out.          XVI    HO-PIN'S CATACOMBS      The newly-created Mr. Lucas entered upon a sort of cave-man existence  in this fantastic abode where night was day and day was night; where the  sun never shone.    He was awakened on the first morning of his sojourn in the establishment  of Ho-Pin by the loud ringing of an electric bell immediately beside his  bed. He sprang upright with a catching of the breath, peering about him  at the unfamiliar surroundings and wondering, in the hazy manner of a  sleeper newly awakened, where he was, and how come there. He was fully  dressed, and his strapped-up grip lay beside him on the floor; for he  had not dared to remove his clothes, had not dared to seek slumber  after that terrifying interview with Mr. King. But outraged nature had  prevailed, and sleep had come unbeckoned, unbidden.    The electric light was still burning in the room, as he had left it, and  as he sat up, looking about him, a purring whistle drew his attention to  a speaking-tube which protruded below the bell.    Soames rolled from the bed, head throbbing, and an acrid taste in his  mouth, and spoke into the tube:    \"Hullo!\"    \"You will pwrepare for youwr duties,\" came the metallic gutturals of  Ho-Pin. \"Bwreakfast will be bwrought to you in a quawrter-of-an-hour.\"    He made no reply, but stood looking about him dully. It had not been a  dream, then, nor was he mad. It was a horrible reality; here, in London,  in modern, civilized London, he was actually buried in some incredible  catacomb; somewhere near to him, very near to him, was the cave of the  golden dragon, and, also adjacent--terrifying thought--was the doorless  library, the rose-scented haunt where the beautiful Eurasian spoke,  oracularly, the responses of Mr. King!    Soames could not understand it all; he felt that such things could  not be; that there must exist an explanation of those seeming  impossibilities other than that they actually existed. But the  instructions were veritable enough, and would not be denied.    Rapidly he began to unpack his grip. His watch had stopped, since he  had neglected to wind it, and he hurried with his toilet, fearful of  incurring the anger of Ho-Pin--of Ho-Pin, the beetlesque.    He observed, with passive interest, that the operation of shaving did  not appreciably lighten the stain upon his skin, and, by the time that  he was shaved, he had begun to know the dark-haired, yellow-faced  man grimacing in the mirror for himself; but he was far from being  reconciled to his new appearance.    Said peeped in at the door. He no longer wore his chauffeur's livery,  but was arrayed in a white linen robe, red-sashed, and wore loose, red  slippers; a tarboosh perched upon his shaven skull.    Pushing the door widely open, he entered with a tray upon which was  spread a substantial breakfast.    \"Hurryup!\" he muttered, as one word; wherewith he departed again.    Soames seated himself at the little table upon which the tray rested,  and endeavored to eat. His usual appetite had departed with his  identity; Mr. Lucas was a poor, twitching being of raw nerves and  internal qualms. He emptied the coffee-pot, however, and smoked a  cigarette which he found in his case.    Said reappeared.    \"Ta'ala!\" he directed.    Soames having learnt that that term was evidently intended as an  invitation to follow Said, rose and followed, dumbly.    He was conducted along the matting-lined corridor to the left; and now,  where formerly he had seen a blank wall, he saw an open door! Passing  this, he discovered himself in the cave of the golden dragon.  Ho-Pin, dressed in a perfectly fitting morning coat and its usual  accompaniments, received him with a mirthless smile.    \"Good mowrning!\" he said; \"I twrust your bwreakfast was satisfactowry?\"    \"Quite, sir,\" replied Soames, mechanically, and as he might have replied  to Mr. Leroux.    \"Said will show you to a wroom,\" continued Ho-Pin, \"where you will find  a gentleman awaiting you. You will valet him and perfowrm any other  services which he may wrequire of you. When he departs, you will clean  the wroom and adjoining bath-wroom, and put it into thowrough order  for an incoming tenant. In short, your duties in this wrespect will be  identical to those which formerly you perfowrmed at sea. There is  one important diffewrence: your name is Lucas, and you will answer no  questions.\"    The metallic voice seemed to reach Soames' comprehension from some place  other than the room of the golden dragon--from a great distance, or as  though he were fastened up in a box and were being addressed by someone  outside it.    \"Yes, sir,\" he replied.    Said opened the yellow door upon the right of the room, and Soames  followed him into another of the matting-lined corridors, this one  running right and left and parallel with the wall of the apartment which  he had just quitted. Six doors opened out of this corridor; four of  them upon the side opposite to that by which he had entered, and one at  either end.    These doors were not readily to be detected; and the wall, at first  glance, presented an unbroken appearance. But from experience, he had  learned that where the strips of bamboo "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#20)"],[1,"music to be found  in that part of Cassiodorus' book dedicated to music.    In the seventh century the first, or perhaps the only author who wrote  upon music was Bishop Isidore, of Seville. In his celebrated treatise  on the etymologies or origins (\"_Isidori Hispaniensis Episcopi  Etymologiarum, Libri XX_\") divided into twenty books, chapters XIV to  XXII of the third book relate to music. These are the chapters  published by the Abbe Gerbert, under the name of \"_Sentences de  Musique_,\" in the collection of ecclesiastical writers upon this art,  after a manuscript in the imperial library at Vienna. While many of  these chapters contain nothing more than generalities and pseudo  historical anecdotes concerning the inventors of this art, this is not  the case with the nineteenth chapter, the sixth in Gerbert's edition,  for here he speaks \"Of the First Division of Music, called Harmony.\"  The definitions given by St. Isidore have a precision, a clearness not  found in other writers of the Middle Ages. \"Harmonic music,\" says he,  \"is at the same time modulation of the voice, and concordance of many  simultaneous sounds. Symphony is the order established between  concordant sounds, low and high, produced by the voice, the breath or  by percussion. Concordant sounds, the highest and the lowest, agree in  such way that if one of them happens to dissonate it offends the ear.  The contrary is the case in diaphony, which is the union of dissonant  sounds.\" Here we find St. Isidore employing the term diaphony in its  original sense, as a Greek word, meaning dissonance--a sense exactly  opposite to that of Jean de Muris.    The Venerable Bede was the light of the eighth century, and the glory  of the Anglo-Saxons. His treatise upon music, however, deals in  theories and generalities, throwing no light upon the music of his  day. The elevation of his ideas may be seen in the following sentence,  with which he introduces his subject: \"It is to be remarked that all  art is contained in reason; and so it is that music consists and  develops itself in relations of numbers.\" (\"_Notandum est, quod omnis  ars in ratione continetur. Musica quoque in ratione numerorum  consistit atque versatur._\")    Only two treatises upon music have come down to us from the ninth  century. The first is by a monk, named Aurelian, in the abbey of Reome  or Montier-Saint-Jean, in the diocese of Langes, who appears to have  lived about the year 850. His book, called \"_Musicae Disciplina_,\" in  twenty chapters, is a compilation of older anecdotes and theories,  throwing no light upon the actual condition of the art in his day. The  sole remaining work of this period was by Remi, of Auxerre, who had  opened the course of theology and music at Rheims in 893, and  afterward at Paris in the earlier years of the tenth century. His  book, like the preceding, is wholly devoted to the ideas of the  ancients.      II.    This brings us to the first writer on music, during the Middle Ages,  whose work throws any important light upon the actual practice of the  art in the period when it was written, namely, Hucbald, a monk of the  convent of St. Armand, in the diocese of Tournay, in French Flanders.  Gerbert gives two treatises upon music, as having come down to us from  this author. Nevertheless there is reason to doubt the genuineness of  one of them--whereof presently. The first of these, the so-called  \"Treatise,\" from a manuscript in the library of the Franciscan convent  at Strassburg, collated with another from Cesene, bears this title:  \"_Incipit Liber Ubaldi Peritissimi Musici de Harmonica Institutione_.\"  The other is called \"_Hucbaldi Monachi Elonensis Musica  Enchiriadis_,\" or \"Manual of Music, by the Monk Hucbald.\" The former  work is of little interest, and if a genuine production of Hucbald's,  probably belongs, as M. Fetis suggests, to his earlier period, when he  was still teaching at Rheims, along with his former classmate, Remi,  of Auxerre.    The manual of Hucbald is not to be regarded as a complete treatise  upon music. It has three principal subjects, namely: The formation of  a new system of notation, the tonality of plain song, and symphony, or  the singing of many voices at different intervals--in other words,  harmony.    In treating the scale he divides it into tetrachords, precisely  according to the Greek method, as far as known to him, and he nowhere  appears to perceive the inapplicability of this division to the  ecclesiastical modes. For representing the sounds of the scale,  divided into four tetrachords, Hucbald proposed the Greek letters,  which in effect, would have been a notation of absolute pitch, with  the farther disadvantage of ignoring the harmonic principles of unity  already discovered, and in fact involved in his own method of  enlarging a two-voice passage by adding a third at the interval of an  octave with the lowest.    He recognizes six kinds of symphony; in reality he employs only three,  the others being reduplications. His symphonies are those of fourths,  fifths and octaves. In all parts of his work but one he uses the term  diaphony as synonymous with symphony; _there_ he gives its ancient  meaning of dissonance.    He proposed a sort of staff notation, upon which all the voices could  be represented at once. The following illustration represents his  staff and his diaphony, or harmony:    [Illustration: POLYPHONIC NOTATION OF HUCBALD.]    The initial letters, T and S, at the beginning of the lines in the  preceding staff indicate the place of the steps (tones) and half steps  (semitones).    [Music illustration: DECIPHERING OF ABOVE.         Sit glo-ri-a Do-mi-ni in sae-cu-la lae-ta-bi-tur       Do-mi-nus in o-pe-ri-bus su-is.]    M. Fetis gives a two-voice parallelism in fifths, which is  progressively enlarged to three voices by adding an octave to the  lower voice; and then to four by doubling the original upper voice in  the octave above. Thus:    [Music illustration: Tu pa-tris sem-pi-ter-nus es fi-li-us.]    In addition to mechanical progressions of parallel motion in this way,  Hucbald in another place gives an account of a so-called \"roving\"  organum, in which, while parallel progressions of fourths and fifths  still are found, there are also other intervals, while the beginning  and the end must be in unison. This form of the harmony of  simultaneous sounds has in it much of the character of counterpoint,  especially in the restriction that the voices must begin and end in  unison. This roving organum, or free organum, was also known as  \"profane\" or \"secular\" organum, in contradistinction to the \"sacred  organum\" already given, upon the sweetness of which Hucbald greatly  prided himself.    Fetis has well said that Hucbald must be considered as one of those  superior spirits who impress upon their epoch a movement in an art or  science. Besides this, he merits particular mention in the history of  music because his works are the first since those of Boethius--a  period of four centuries--in which the art of music is treated  systematically and without obscurity.    In the \"_Epistola de Harmonica Institutione ad Rathbodum Episcopum  Trevinesem_\" (\"Letter to Rathbodum, Bishop of Treves\"), there is  mention of the instruments of music during the seventh and eighth  centuries. They are the cithara and harp as the stringed instruments;  musetts, syrinx and organ among the wind instruments; cymbals and  drums, instruments of percussion. In the tenth century there was a  methodical treatise upon music in dialogue form, published by Odon,  abbot of Cluny, who died in this monastery November 18, 942. This  work, which was wrongfully attributed to Guido of Arezzo, contains a  number of analyses of intervals showing an understanding of the exact  dimensions of the various kinds of fourths, fifths, thirds and sixths.  According to his doctrine, the intervals of the fourths, fifths and  octaves are more natural for the voice than the others called thirds  and sixths, because the former are invariable, while the latter may be  larger or smaller by a half step. He makes a summary of ecclesiastical  chant, mentioning the modes as established by St. Gregory,  illustrating each of them by a selection from the \"Plain Song.\" It is  a fact significant of the unsettled condition of musical theory and  the complete unconsciousness of musical amateurs that any essential  change in the art was being undergone, that as late as 1000 or 1020  Adelbold, Bishop of Utrecht, published a treatise upon music in which  the proportions of the tetrachords are calculated carefully according  to the Greek theories, and demonstrated upon the monochord.      III.    The most important writer upon music in the eleventh century, and one  of the most famous in the history of the art, was a monk named Guido,  living at Arezzo, in Tuscany, a Benedictine in the abbey of Pontose.  He was a remarkably skillful teacher of ecclesiastical singing, both  in his own monastery and at Rome, and in the effort to systematize the  elements of music he introduced a number of important reforms, and is  credited by later writers with many others which he did not himself  originate, but which grew out of some of his suggestions. He is  generally credited with having invented the art of solmization, the  introduction of the staff, the use of the hand for teaching intervals,  and the introduction of notes. He was not the first who introduced the  staff. Hucbald, as we have already seen, employed the spaces between  the lines for designating pitch. Between his time and that of Guido,  one or more lines were introduced in connection with the neumae, as  will be more particularly illustrated in chapter XV. Guido, however,  employed both the lines and the spaces, but instead of notes he wrote  the Roman letters upon the lines and spaces according to their pitch.  The notes were invented shortly after his time. For determining the  correct pitch"]]]
