Do you think if I told  that prosperous New Yorker who is buying a cigar yonder, for  instance, that I had been driven from my chambers by a band of  Eastern assassins founded some time in the eleventh century, he  would believe it?\"    \"I am certain he wouldn't!\" replied Bristol.  \"I should not have  credited it myself before I was put in charge of this damnable case.\"    My position at that hour was in truth an incredible one.  The sacred  slipper of Mohammed lay once more in the glass case at the  Antiquarian Museum from which Earl Dexter had stolen it.  Now, with  apish yellow faces haunting my dreams, with ghostly menaces dogging  me day and night, I was outcast from my own rooms and compelled, in  self-defence, to live amid the bustle of the Astoria.  So wholly  nonplussed were the police authorities that they could afford me no  protection.  They knew that a group of scientific murderers lay  hidden in or near to London; they knew that Earl Dexter, the foremost  crook of his day, was also in the metropolis--and they could make no  move, were helpless; indeed, as Bristol had confessed, were hopeless!    Bristol, on the previous day, had unearthed the Greek cigar merchant,  Acepulos, who had replaced the slipper in its case (for a monetary  consideration).  He had performed a similar service when the  bloodstained thing had first been put upon exhibition at the Museum,  and for a considerable period had disappeared.  We had feared that  his religious pretensions had not saved him from the avenging  scimitar of Hassan; but quite recently he had returned again to his  Soho shop, and in time thus to earn a second cheque.    As Bristol and I stood glancing about the foyer of the hotel, a  plain-clothes officer whom I knew by sight came in and approached  my companion.  I could not divine the fact, of course, but I was  about to hear news of the money-loving and greatly daring  Graeco-Moslem.    The detective whispered something to Bristol, and the latter started,  and paled.  He turned to me.    \"They haven't overlooked him this time, Mr. Cavanagh,\" he said.  \"Acepulos has been found dead in his room, nearly decapitated!\"    I shuddered involuntarily.  Even there, amid the chatter and laughter  of those light-hearted tourists, the shadow of Hassan of Aleppo was  falling upon me.    Bristol started immediately for Soho and I parted from him in the  Strand, he proceeding west and I eastward, for I had occasion that  morning to call at my bank.  It was the time of the year when London  is full of foreigners, and as I proceeded in the direction of Fleet  Street I encountered more than one Oriental.  To my excited  imagination they all seemed to glance at me furtively, with menacing  eyes, but in any event I knew that I had little to fear whilst I  contrived to keep to the crowded thoroughfares.  Solitude I dreaded  and with good reason.    Then at the door of the bank I found fresh matter for reflection.  The assistant manager, Mr. Colby, was escorting a lady to the door.  As I stood aside, he walked with her to a handsome car which waited,  and handed her in with marks of great deference.  She was heavily  veiled and I had no more than a glimpse of her, but she appeared to  be of middle age and had gray hair and a very stately manner.    I told myself that I was unduly suspicious, suspicious of everyone  and of everything; yet as I entered the bank I found myself wondering  where I had seen that dignified, grayhaired figure before.  I even  thought of asking the manager the name of his distinguished customer,  but did not do so, for in the circumstances such an inquiry must  have appeared impertinent.    My business transacted, I came out again by the side entrance which  opens on the little courtyard, for this branch of the London County  and Provincial Bank occupies a corner site.    A ragged urchin who was apparently waiting for me handed me a note.  I looked at him inquiringly.    \"For me?\" I said.    \"Yes, sir.  A dark gentleman pointed you out as you was goin' into  the bank.\"    The note was written upon a half sheet of paper and, doubting if it  was really intended for me, I unfolded it and read the following--      Mr. Cavanagh, take the keys of the case containing the holy slipper    to your hotel this evening without fail.                                                              HASSAN.    \"Who gave you this, boy?\" I asked sharply.    \"A foreign gentleman, sir, very dark--like an Indian.\"    \"Where is he?\"    \"He went off in a cab, sir, after he give me the note.\"    I handed the boy sixpence and slowly pursued my way.  An idea was  forming in my mind to trap the enemy by seeming acquiescent.  I  wondered if my movements were being watched at that moment.  Since  it was more than probable, I returned to the bank, entered, and  made some trivial inquiry of a cashier, and then came out again and  walked on as far as the Report office.    I had not been in the office more than five minutes before I  received a telegram from Inspector Bristol.  It had been handed in  at Soho, and the message was an odd one.      CAVANAGH, Report, London.    Plot afoot to steal keys.  Get them from bank and join me 11 o'clock    at Astoria.  Have planned trap.                                                             BRISTOL.    This was very mysterious in view of the note so recently received by  me, but I concluded that Bristol had hit upon a similar plan to that  which was forming in my own mind.  It seemed unnecessarily hazardous,  though, actually to withdraw the keys from their place of safety.    Pondering deeply upon the perplexities of this maddening case, I  shortly afterward found myself again at the bank.  With the manager  I descended to the strong-room, and the safe was unlocked which  contained the much-sought-for keys of the case at the Antiquarian  Museum.    \"There are the keys, quite safe!--and by the way, this is my second  visit here this morning, Mr. Cavanagh,\" said the manager, with whom  I was upon rather intimate terms.  \"A foreign lady who has recently  become a customer of the bank deposited some valuable jewels here  this morning--less than an hour ago, in fact.\"    \"Indeed,\" I said, and my mind was working rapidly.  \"The lady who  came in the large blue car, a gray-haired lady?\"    \"Yes,\" was the reply, \"did you notice her, then?\"    I nodded and said no more, for in truth I had no more to say.  I  had good reason to respect the uncanny powers of Hassan of Aleppo,  but I doubted if even his omniscience could tell him (since I had  actually gone down into the strong-room) whether when I emerged I  had the keys, or whether my visit and seeming acceptance of his  orders had been no more than a subterfuge!    That the Hashishin had some means of communicating with me at the  Astoria was evident from the contents of the note which I had  received, and as I walked in the direction of the hotel my mind  was filled with all sorts of misgivings.  I was playing with fire!  Had I done rightly or should I have acted otherwise?  I sighed  wearily.  The dark future would resolve all my doubts.    When I reached the Astoria, Bristol had not arrived.  I lighted a  cigarette and sat down in the lounge to await his coming.  Presently  a boy approached, handing me a message which had been taken down  from the telephone by the clerk.  It was as follows--      Tell Mr. Cavanagh, who is waiting in the hotel, to take what I am    expecting to his chambers, and say that I will join him there in    twenty minutes.                                                   INSPECTOR BRISTOL.    Again I doubted the wisdom of Bristol's plan.  Had I not fled to  the Astoria to escape from the dangerous solitude of my rooms?  That  he was laying some trap for the Hashishin was sufficiently evident,  and whilst I could not justly suspect him of making a pawn of me  I was quite unable to find any other explanation of this latest move.    I was torn between conflicting doubts.  I glanced at my watch.  Yes!  There was just time for me to revisit the bank ere joining Bristol  at my chambers!  I hesitated.  After all, in what possible way could  it jeopardize his plans for me merely to pretend to bring the keys?    \"Hang it all!\" I said, and jumped to my feet.  \"These maddening  conjectures will turn my brain!  I'll let matters stand as they  are, and risk the consequences!\"    I hesitated no longer, but passed out from the hotel and once more  directed my steps in the direction of Fleet Street.    As I passed in under the arch through which streamed many busy  workers, I told myself that to dread entering my own chambers at  high noon was utterly childish.  Yet I did dread doing so!  And as  I mounted the stair and came to the landing, which was always more  or less dark, I paused for quite a long time before putting the  key in the lock.    The affair of the accursed slipper was playing havoc with my nerves,  and I laughed dryly to note that my hand was not quite steady as I  turned the key, opened my door, and slipped into the dim hallway.    As I closed it behind me, something, probably a slight noise, but  possibly something more subtle--an instinct--made me turn rapidly.    There facing me stood Hassan of Aleppo.          CHAPTER XXIV    I KEEP THE APPOINTMENT      That moment was pungent with drama.  In the intense hush of the  next five seconds I could fancy that the world had slipped away  from me and that I was become an unsubstantial thing of dreams.  I was in no sense master of myself; the effect of the presence of  this white-bearded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21272"],[0,"The Bibliotaph, and Other People (#20)"],[1,"gracious gentleman, Professor Edward Arber, to inquire          whether in his opinion one might hope to buy at a modest          price a copy of either the first or the second part of          _Euphues_. Professor Arber's reply was amusingly emphatic:          'You might as well try to purchase one of Mahomet's old          slippers.' But in July of 1896 there were four copies of          this old novel on sale at one New York bookstore. One of          the copies was of great beauty, consisting of the two          parts of the story bound up together in a really sumptuous          fashion. The price was not large as prices of such books          go, but on the other hand ''a was not small.'    To pronounce upon this romance is not easy. We read a dozen or two of  pages, and say, 'This is very fantastical humours.' We read further,  and are tempted to follow Sir Hugh to the extent of declaring, 'This  is lunatics.' One may venture the not profound remark that it takes  all sorts of books to make a literature. _Euphues_ is one of the books  that would prompt to that very remark. For he who first said that it  takes all sorts of people to make a world was markedly impressed with  the differences between those people and himself. He had in mind  eccentric folk, types which deviate from the normal and the sane. So  _Euphues_ is a very Malvolio among books, cross-gartered and wreathed  as to its countenance with set smiles. The curious in literary history  will always enjoy such a production. The verdict of that part of the  reading world which keeps a book alive by calling for fresh copies of  it after the old copies are worn out is against _Euphues_. It had a  vivacious existence between 1579 and 1636, and then went into a  literary retirement lasting two hundred and thirty-six years. When it  again came before the public it was introduced as 'a great  bibliographical rarity.' Its fatal old-fashionedness hangs like a  millstone about its neck. In the poems of Chaucer and the dramas of  Shakespeare are a thousand touches which make the reader feel that  Chaucer and Shakespeare are his contemporaries, that they have written  in his own time, and published but yesterday. Read _Euphues_, and you  will say to yourself, 'That book must have been written three hundred  years ago, and it looks its age.' Yet it has its virtues. One may not  say of it, as Johnson said of the _Rehearsal_, that it 'has not wit  enough to keep it sweet.' Neither may he, upon second thought,  conclude that 'it has not vitality enough to preserve it from  putrefaction.' It has, indeed, a bottom of good sense; and so had  Malvolio. It is filled from end to beginning with wit, or with what  passed for wit among many readers of that day. Often the wit is of a  tawdry and spectacular sort,--mere verbal wit, the use of a given word  not because it is the best word, the most fitting word, but because  the author wants a word beginning with the letter G, or the letter M,  or the letter F, as the case may be. On the second page of Greene's  _Arbasto_ is this sentence: 'He did not so much as vouchsafe to give  an _eare_ to my _parle_, or an _eye_ to my _person_.' Greene learned  this trick from Lyly, who was a master of the art. The sentence  represents one of the common forms in _Euphues_, such as this: 'To the  stomach _quatted_ with _dainties_ all _delicates_ seem _queasie_.'  Sometimes the balance is preserved by three words on a side. For  example, the companions whom Euphues found in Naples practiced arts  'whereby they might either _soake_ his _purse_ to reape _commodotie_,  or _sooth_ his _person_ to winne _credite_.' Other illustrations are  these: I can neither '_remember_ our _miseries_ without _griefe_, nor  _redresse_ our _mishaps_ without _grones_.' 'If the _wasting_ of our  _money_ might not _dehort_ us, yet the _wounding_ of our _mindes_  should _deterre_ us.' This next sentence, with its combination of K  sounds, clatters like a pair of castanets: 'Though Curio bee as hot as  a toast, yet Euphues is as cold as a clocke, though hee bee a cocke of  the game, yet Euphues is content to bee craven and crye creake.'    Excess of alliteration is the most obvious feature of Lyly's style.  That style has been carefully analyzed by those who are learned in  such things. The study is interesting, with its talk of alliteration  and transverse alliteration, antithesis, climax, and assonance. In  truth, one does not know which to admire the more, the ingenuity of  the man who constructed the book, or the ingenuity of the scholars who  have explained how he did it. Between Lyly on the one hand, and the  grammarians on the other, the reader is almost tempted to ask if this  be literature or mathematics. Whether Lyly got his style from Pettie  or Guevara is an important question, but he made it emphatically his  own, and it will never be called by any other name than Euphuism. The  making of a book on this plan is largely the result of astonishing  mental gymnastics. It commands respect in no small degree, because  Lyly was able to keep it up so long. To walk from New York to Albany,  as did the venerable Weston not so very long since, is a great test of  human endurance. But walking is the employment of one's legs and body  in God's appointed way of getting over the ground. Suppose a man were  to undertake to hop on one leg from New York to Albany, the utility or  the aesthetic value of the performance would be less obvious. The most  successful artist in hopping could hardly expect applause from the  right-minded. He would excite attention because he was able to hop so  far, and not because he was the exponent of a praiseworthy method of  locomotion. Lyly gained eminence by doing to a greater extent than any  man a thing that was not worth doing at all. One is more astonished at  Lyly's power of endurance as author than at his own power of endurance  as reader. For the volume is actually readable even at this day. Did  Lyly not grow wearied of perpetually riding these alliterative  trick-ponies? Apparently not. The book is 'executed' with a vivacity,  a dash, a 'go,' that will captivate any reader who is willing to meet  the author halfway. _Euphues_ became the rage, and its literary style  the fashion. How or why must be left to him to explain who can tell  why sleeves grow small and then grow big, why skirts are at one time  only two and a half yards around and at another time five and a half  or eight yards around. An Elizabethan gentleman might be too poor to  dress well, but he would squander his last penny in getting his ruff  starched. Lyly's style bristles with extravagances of the starched  ruff sort, which only serve to call attention to the intellectual  deficiencies in the matter of doublet and hose.    Of plot or story there is but little. The hero, Euphues, who gives the  title to the romance, is a young, clever, and rich Athenian. He visits  Naples, where his money and wit attract many to his side. By his  careless, pleasure-seeking mode of life he wakens the fatherly  interest of a wise old gentleman, Eubulus, who calls upon him to warn  him of his danger. The conversation between the two is the first and  not the least amusing illustration of the courtly verbal fencing with  which the book is filled. The advice of the old man only provokes  Euphues into making the sophistical plea that his style of living is  right because nature prompts him to it; and he leaves Eubulus 'in a  great quandary' and in tears. Nevertheless, the old gentleman has the  righteous energy which prompts him to say to the departing Euphues,  already out of hearing, 'Seeing thou wilt not buy counsel at the first  hand good cheap, thou shalt buy repentance at the second hand, at such  unreasonable rate, that thou wilt curse thy hard pennyworth, and ban  thy hard heart.' Euphues takes to himself a new sworn brother, one  Philautus, who carries him to visit his lady-love, Lucilla. Lucilla is  rude at first, but becomes enamored of Euphues's conversational power,  and finally of himself. In fact, she unceremoniously throws over her  former lover, and tells her father that she will either marry Euphues  or else lead apes in hell. This causes a break in the friendship  between Euphues and Philautus, and there is an exchange of formidably  worded letters, in which Philautus reminds Euphues that all Greeks are  liars, and Euphues quotes Euripides to the effect that all is lawful  in love. Lucilla, who is fickle, suddenly dismisses her new cavalier  for yet a third, while Euphues and Philautus, in the light of their  common misfortune, fall upon each other's necks and are reconciled.  Both profess themselves to have been fools, while Euphues, as the  greater and more recent fool, composes a pamphlet against love. This  he calls a 'cooling-card.' It is addressed primarily to Philautus, but  contains general advice for 'all fond lovers.' Euphues's own cure was  radical, for he says, 'Now do I give a farewell to the world, meaning  rather to macerate myself with melancholy, than pine in folly, rather  choosing to die in my study amidst my books than to court it in Italy  in the company of ladies.' He returns to Athens, applies himself to  the study of philosophy, becomes public reader in the University, and,  as crowning evidence that he has finished sowing his wild oats,  produces three volumes of lectures. Realizing how much of his own  youth has been wasted, he writes a pamphlet on the education of the  young, a dialogue with an atheist, and these, with a bundle of  letters, make up the first part of the _Anatomy of Wit_. From one of  the letters we learn that Lucilla was as frail as she was beautiful,  and that she died in evil report. The story, including the diatribe  against love, is about as long as _The Vicar of Wakefield_. It begins  as a romance and ends as a sermon.    The continuation of the novel, _Euphues and his England_, is a little  over a third longer "]]]
