Look, that's him--isn't it, Robert?--on  the gray horse.\"    Jane consented to look, and the scene was almost too pretty to be  alarming. The green turf, the white tents, the flash of pennoned lances,  the gleam of armour, and the bright colours of scarf and tunic--it was  just like a splendid coloured picture. The trumpets were sounding, and  when the trumpeters stopped for breath the children could hear the  cling-clang of armour and the murmur of voices.    A trumpeter came forward to the edge of the moat, which now seemed very  much narrower than at first, and blew the longest and loudest blast they  had yet heard. When the blaring noise had died away, a man who was with  the trumpeter shouted--    \"What ho, within there!\" and his voice came plainly to the garrison in  the gate-house.    \"Hullo there!\" Robert bellowed back at once.    \"In the name of our Lord the King, and of our good lord and trusty  leader Sir Wulfric de Talbot, we summon this castle to surrender--on  pain of fire and sword and no quarter. Do ye surrender?\"    \"_No_\" bawled Robert; \"of course we don't! Never, _Never, NEVER_!\"    The man answered back--    \"Then your fate be on your own heads.\"    \"Cheer,\" said Robert in a fierce whisper. \"Cheer to show them we aren't  afraid, and rattle the daggers to make more noise. One, two, three! Hip,  hip, hooray! Again--Hip, hip, hooray! One more--Hip, hip, hooray!\" The  cheers were rather high and weak, but the rattle of the daggers lent  them strength and depth.    There was another shout from the camp across the moat--and then the  beleaguered fortress felt that the attack had indeed begun.    It was getting rather dark in the room above the great gate, and Jane  took a very little courage as she remembered that sunset _couldn't_ be  far off now.    \"The moat is dreadfully thin,\" said Anthea.    \"But they can't get into the castle even if they do swim over,\" said  Robert. And as he spoke he heard feet on the stair outside--heavy feet  and the clang of steel. No one breathed for a moment. The steel and the  feet went on up the turret stairs. Then Robert sprang softly to the  door. He pulled off his shoes.    \"Wait here,\" he whispered, and stole quickly and softly after the boots  and the spur-clank. He peeped into the upper room. The man was  there--and it was Jakin, all dripping with moat-water, and he was  fiddling about with the machinery which Robert felt sure worked the  drawbridge. Robert banged the door suddenly, and turned the great key in  the lock, just as Jakin sprang to the inside of the door. Then he tore  downstairs and into the little turret at the foot of the tower where the  biggest window was.    \"We ought to have defended _this_!\" he cried to the others as they  followed him. He was just in time. Another man had swum over, and his  fingers were on the window-ledge. Robert never knew how the man had  managed to climb up out of the water. But he saw the clinging fingers,  and hit them as hard as he could with an iron bar that he caught up from  the floor. The man fell with a splash into the moat-water. In another  moment Robert was outside the little room, had banged its door and was  shooting home the enormous bolts, and calling to Cyril to lend a hand.    [Illustration: The man fell with a splash into the moat-water]    Then they stood in the arched gate-house, breathing hard and looking at  each other.    Jane's mouth was open.    \"Cheer up, Jenny,\" said Robert,--\"it won't last much longer.\"    There was a creaking above, and something rattled and shook. The  pavement they stood on seemed to tremble. Then a crash told them that  the drawbridge had been lowered to its place.    \"That's that beast Jakin,\" said Robert. \"There's still the portcullis;  I'm almost certain that's worked from lower down.\"    And now the drawbridge rang and echoed hollowly to the hoofs of horses  and the tramp of armed men.    \"Up--quick!\" cried Robert,--\"let's drop things on them.\"    Even the girls were feeling almost brave now. They followed Robert  quickly, and under his directions began to drop stones out through the  long narrow windows. There was a confused noise below, and some groans.    \"Oh dear!\" said Anthea, putting down the stone she was just going to  drop out, \"I'm afraid we've hurt somebody!\"    Robert caught up the stone in a fury.    \"I should hope we _had_!\" he said; \"I'd give something for a jolly good  boiling kettle of lead. Surrender, indeed!\"    And now came more tramping and a pause, and then the thundering thump of  the battering-ram. And the little room was almost pitch dark.    \"We've held it,\" cried Robert, \"we _won't_ surrender! The sun _must_ set  in a minute. Here--they're all jawing underneath again. Pity there's no  time to get more stones! Here, pour that water down on them. It's no  good, of course, but they'll hate it.\"    \"Oh dear!\" said Jane, \"don't you think we'd better surrender?\"    \"Never!\" said Robert; \"we'll have a parley if you like, but we'll never  surrender. Oh, I'll be a soldier when I grow up--you just see if I  don't. I won't go into the Civil Service, whatever anyone says.\"    \"Let's wave a handkerchief and ask for a parley,\" Jane pleaded. \"I don't  believe the sun's going to set to-night at all.\"    \"Give them the water first--the brutes!\" said the bloodthirsty Robert.  So Anthea tilted the pot over the nearest lead-hole, and poured. They  heard a splash below, but no one below seemed to have felt it. And again  the ram battered the great door. Anthea paused.    [Illustration: Anthea tilted the pot over the nearest lead-hole]    \"How idiotic,\" said Robert, lying flat on the floor and putting one eye  to the lead-hole. \"Of course the holes go straight down into the  gate-house--that's for when the enemy has got past the door and the  portcullis, and almost all is lost. Here, hand me the pot.\" He crawled  on to the three-cornered window-ledge in the middle of the wall, and,  taking the pot from Anthea, poured the water out through the arrow-slit.    And as he began to pour, the noise of the battering-ram and the  trampling of the foe and the shouts of \"Surrender!\" and \"De Talbot for  ever!\" all suddenly stopped and went out like the snuff of a candle; the  little dark room seemed to whirl round and turn topsy-turvy, and when  the children came to themselves there they were, safe and sound, in the  big front bedroom of their own house--the house with the ornamental  nightmare iron-top to the roof.    They all crowded to the window and looked out. The moat and the tents  and the besieging force were all gone--and there was the garden with its  tangle of dahlias and marigolds and asters and later roses, and the  spiky iron railings and the quiet white road.    Everyone drew a deep breath.    \"And that's all right!\" said Robert. \"I told you so! And, I say, we  didn't surrender, did we?\"    \"Aren't you glad now I wished for a castle?\" asked Cyril.    \"I think I am _now_,\" said Anthea slowly. \"But I wouldn't wish for it  again, I think, Squirrel dear!\"    \"Oh, it was simply splendid!\" said Jane unexpectedly. \"I wasn't  frightened a bit.\"    \"Oh, I say!\" Cyril was beginning, but Anthea stopped him.    \"Look here,\" she said, \"it's just come into my head. This is the very  first thing we've wished for that hasn't got us into a row. And there  hasn't been the least little scrap of a row about this. Nobody's raging  downstairs, we're safe and sound, we've had an awfully jolly day--at  least, not jolly exactly, but you know what I mean. And we know now how  brave Robert is--and Cyril too, of course,\" she added hastily, \"and  Jane as well. And we haven't got into a row with a single grown-up.\"    The door was opened suddenly and fiercely.    \"You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,\" said the voice of Martha, and  they could tell by her voice that she was very angry indeed. \"I thought  you couldn't last through the day without getting up to some mischief! A  person can't take a breath of air on the front doorstep but you must be  emptying the water jug on their heads! Off you go to bed, the lot of  you, and try to get up better children in the morning. Now then--don't  let me have to tell you twice. If I find any of you not in bed in ten  minutes I'll let you know it, that's all! A new cap, and everything!\"    She flounced out amid a disregarded chorus of regrets and apologies. The  children were very sorry, but really it was not their faults.    You can't help it if you are pouring water on a besieging foe, and your  castle suddenly changes into your house--and everything changes with it  except the water, and that happens to fall on somebody else's clean cap.    \"I don't know why the water didn't change into nothing, though,\" said  Cyril.    \"Why should it?\" asked Robert. \"Water's water all the world over.\"    \"I expect the castle well was the same as ours in the stable-yard,\" said  Jane. And that was really the case.    \"I thought we couldn't get through a wish-day without a row,\" said  Cyril; \"it was much too good to be true. Come on, Bobs, my military  hero. If we lick into bed sharp she won't be so furious, and perhaps  she'll bring us up some supper. I'm jolly hungry! Good-night, kids.\"    \"Good-night. I hope the castle won't come creeping back in the night,\"  said Jane.    \"Of course it won't,\" said Anthea briskly, \"but Martha will--not in the  night, but in a minute. Here, turn round, I'll get that knot out of your  pinafore strings.\"    \"Wouldn't it have been degrading for Sir Wulfric de Talbot,\" said Jane  dreamily, \"if he could have known that half the besieged garrison wore  pinafores?\"    \"And the other half knickerbockers. Yes--frightfully. Do stand  still--you're only tightening the knot,\" said Anthea.          CHAPTER VIII    BIGGER THAN THE BAKER'S BOY      \"Look here,\" said Cyril. \"I've got an idea.\"    \"Does it hurt much?\" said Robert sympathetically.    \"Don't be a jackanape!

An Egyptian etymology was found for it as \"_Ro-pi-ro-henet_,\"  \"Temple-mouth-canal,\" which might be interpreted, with some violence to  Egyptian construction, as \"The temple at the mouth of the canal,\" i.e.  the Bahr Yusuf, which enters the Fayyum at Hawara. But unluckily this  word would have been pronounced by the natives of the vicinity as  \"Elphilahune,\" which is not very much like    [Illustration: 126.jpg (Greek word)]    \"_Ro-pi-ro-henet_\" is, in fact, a mere figment of the philological  imagination, and cannot be proved ever to have existed. The element  _Ro-henet_, \"canal-mouth\" (according to the local pronunciation of the  Fayyum and Middle Egypt, called _La-hune_), is genuine; it is the  origin of the modern Illahun (_el-Lahun_), which is situated at the  \"canal-mouth.\" However, now that we know that the word labyrinth can be  explained satisfactorily with the help of Karian, as evidently of Greek  (pre-Aryan) origin, and as evidently the original name of the Knossian  labyrinth, it is obvious that there is no need to seek a far-fetched  explanation of the word in Egypt, and to suppose that the Greeks called  the Cretan labyrinth after the Egyptian one.    The contrary is evidently the case. Greek visitors to Egypt found a  resemblance between the great Egyptian building, with its numerous halls  and corridors, vast in extent, and the Knossian palace. Even if very  little of the latter was visible in the classical period, as seems  possible, yet the site seems always to have been kept holy and free from  later building till Roman times, and we know that the tradition of the  mazy halls and corridors of the labyrinth was always clear, and was  evidently based on a vivid reminiscence. Actually, one of the most  prominent characteristics of the Knossian palace is its mazy and  labyrinthine system of passages and chambers. The parallel between the  two buildings, which originally caused the Greek visitors to give the  pyramid-temple of Hawara the name of \"labyrinth,\" has been traced still  further. The white limestone walls and the shining portals of \"Parian  marble,\" described by Strabo as characteristic of the Egyptian  labyrinth, have been compared with the shining white selenite or gypsum  used at Knossos, and certain general resemblances between the Greek  architecture of the Minoan age and the almost contemporary Egyptian  architecture of the XIIth Dynasty have been pointed out.* Such  resemblances may go to swell the amount of evidence already known, which  tells us that there was a close connection between Egyptian and Minoan  art and civilization, established at least as early as 2500 B.C.         * See H. R. Hall, Journal of Hellenic Studies, 1905 (Pt.       ii). The Temple of the Sphinx at Giza may also be compared       with those of Hawara and Knossos. It seems most probable       that the Temple of the Sphinx is a XIIth Dynasty building.    For it must be remembered that within the last few years we have learned  from the excavations in Crete a new chapter of ancient history, which,  it might almost seem, shows us Greece and Egypt in regular communication  from nearly the beginnings of Egyptian history. As the excavations which  have told us this were carried on in Crete, not in Egypt, to describe  them does not lie within the scope of this book, though a short sketch  of their results, so far as they affect Egyptian history in later days,  is given in Chapter VII. Here it may suffice to say that, as far as  the early period is concerned, Egypt and Crete were certainly in  communication in the time of the XIIth Dynasty, and quite possibly in  that of the VIth or still earlier. We have IIId Dynasty Egyptian vases  from Knossos, which were certainly not imported in later days, for no  ancient nation had antiquarian tastes till the time of the Saites in  Egypt and of the Romans still later. In fact, this communication seems  to go so far back in time that we are gradually being led to perceive  the possibility that the Minoan culture of Greece was in its origin an  offshoot from that of primeval Egypt, probably in early Neolithic times.  That is to say, the Neolithic Greeks and Neolithic Egyptians were both  members of the same \"Mediterranean\" stock, which quite possibly may have  had its origin in Africa, and a portion of which may have crossed the  sea to Europe in very early times, taking with it the seeds of culture  which in Egypt developed in the Egyptian way, in Greece in the Greek  way. Actual communication and connection may not have been maintained  at first, and probably they were not. Prof. Petrie thinks otherwise, and  would see in the boats painted on the predynastic Egyptian vases (see  Chapter I) the identical galleys by which, in late Neolithic  times, commerce between Crete and Egypt was carried on across the  Mediterranean. It is certain, however, that these boats are ordinary  little river craft, the usual Nile _felukas_ and _gyassas_ of the time;  they are depicted together with emblems of the desert and cultivated  land,-ostriches, antelopes, hills, and palm-trees,-and the thoroughly  inland and Upper Egyptian character of the whole design springs to the  eye. There can be no doubt whatever that the predynastic boats were not  seagoing galleys.    It was probably not till the time of the pyramid-builders that  connection between the Greek Mediterraneans and the Nilotes was  re-established. Thence-forward it increased, and in the time of the  XIIth Dynasty, when the labyrinth of Amenemhat III was built, there  seems to have been some kind of more or less regular communication  between the two countries.    It is certain that artistic ideas were exchanged between them at this  period. How communication was carried on we do not know, but it was  probably rather by way of Cyprus and the Syrian coast than directly  across the open sea. We shall revert to this point when we come to  describe the connection between Crete and Egypt in the time of the  XVIIIth Dynasty, when Cretan ambassadors visited the Egyptian court and  were depicted in tomb paintings at Thebes. Between the time of the XIIth  Dynasty and that of the XVIIIth this connection seems to have been very  considerably strengthened; for at Knossos have been found an Egyptian  statuette of an Egyptian named Abnub, who from his name must have lived  about the end of the XIIIth Dynasty, and the top of an alabastron with  the royal name of Khian, one of the Hyksos kings.    Quite close to Hawara, at Illahun, in the ruins of the town which was  built by Usertsen's workmen when they were building his pyramid, Prof.  Petrie found fragments of pottery of types which we now know well from  excavations in Crete and Cyprus, though they were then unknown. They are  fragments of the polychrome Cretan ware called, after the name of the  place where it was first found in Crete, Kamares ware, and of a black  ware ornamented with small punctures, which are often filled up with  white. This latter ware has been found elsewhere associated with XIIIth  Dynasty antiquities. The former is known to belong in Crete to the  \"early Minoan\" period, long anterior to the \"late Minoan\" or \"Palace\"  period, which was contemporary with the Egyptian XVIIIth Dynasty.  We have here another interesting proof of a connection between XIIth  Dynasty Egypt and early Minoan Crete. The later connection, under the  XVIIIth and following dynasties, is also illustrated in the same reign  by Prof. Petrie's finds of late Mycenaean objects and foreign graves at  Medinet Gurob.*         * One man who was buried here bore the name An-Tursha,       \"Pillar of the Tursha.\" The Tursha were a people of the       Mediterranean, possibly Tylissians of Crete.    These excavations at Hawara, Illahun, Kahun, and Gurob were carried out  in the years 1887-9. Since then Prof. Petrie and his co-workers have  revisited the same district, and Gurob has been re-examined (in 1904)  by Messrs. Loat and Ayrton, who discovered there a shrine devoted to  the worship of fish. This work was carried on at the same time as Prof.  Petrie's main excavation for the Egypt Exploration Fund at Annas, or  Ahnas-yet el-Medina, the site of the ancient Henensu, the Herakleopolis  of the Greeks. Prof. Naville had excavated there for the Egypt  Exploration Fund in 1892, but had not completely cleared the temple.  This work was now taken up by Prof. Petrie, who laid the whole building  bare. It is dedicated to Hershefi, the local deity of Herakleopolis.  This god, who was called Ar-saphes by the Greeks, and identified with  Herakles, was in fact a form of Horus with the head of a ram; his name  means \"Terrible-Face.\" The greater part of the temple dates to the time  of the XIXth Dynasty, and nothing of the early period is left. We know,  however, that the Middle Kingdom was the flourishing period of the  city of Hershefi. For a comparatively brief period, between the age of  Memphite hegemony and that of Theban dominion, Herakleopolis was the  capital city of Egypt. The kings of the IXth and Xth Dynasties were  Herakleopolites, though we know little of them. One, Kheti, is said to  have been a great tyrant. Another, Nebkaura, is known only as a figure  in the \"Legend of the Eloquent Peasant,\" a classical story much in vogue  in later days. Another, Merikara, is a more real personage, for we have  contemporary records of his days in the inscriptions of the tombs at  Asyut, from which we see that the princes of Thebes were already wearing  down the Northerners, in spite of the resistance of the adherents of  Herakleopolis, among whom the most valiant were the chiefs of Asyut. The  civil war eventuated in favour of Thebes, and"]]]
