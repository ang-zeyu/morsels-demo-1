The  Sanscrit word Akshapujah is differently interpreted. Kosegarten  renders it in a good sense as \"fearing heaven.\" He argues that it is  the poet's object in this passage to describe the good qualities of  Nala, and that he does not become a gamester till possessed by the  demon Kali. Bopp gives the sense in the text, which seems to connect  it with the history of king Yudishthira, to whom it is addressed.]    [Footnote 5: p. 3. l. 7. _Sense subdued_. The highest notion of this  favourite perfection of Indian character, may be given in the words of  the author of the Bhagavat-Gita: \"The highest perfection to which the  soul can attain, is action without passion. The mind is to be entirely  independent of external objects; to preserve its undisturbed serenity  it should have the conscious power of withdrawing all its senses  within itself, as the tortoise draws all its limbs beneath in shell.\"  Action is necessary, but action must produce no emotion--no sensation  on the calm spirit within; whatever may be their consequences, however  important, however awful, events are to be unfelt, and almost  unperceived by the impassive mind; and on this principle Arjuna is to  execute the fated slaughter upon his kindred without the least feeling  of sorrow or compunction being permitted to intrude on the divine  apathy of his soul. Some of the images in which this passionless  tranquillity of the spirit is described, appear singularly beautiful:        As to th' unrais'd unswelling ocean flow the multitudinous streams,      So to the soul serene, unmov'd--flow in the undisturbing lusts.    And then again the soul, in this state of unbroken quietude,        Floats like the lotus on the lake, unmov'd, unruffled by the tide.]    [Footnote 6: p. 3. l. 8. _Best, a present Manu he_. Manu, or Menu,  the representative of the human race; the holy, mythological ancestor  of the Hindus. In the Diluvium, the Indian version of the Deluge, (see  the latter part of this volume), Manu is the survivor of the human  race--the second ancestor of mankind. The first Menu is named  \"Swayambhuva, or sprung from the self-existing.\" From him \"came six  descendants, other Menus, or perfectly understanding the Scripture,  each giving birth to a race of his own, all exalted in dignity,  eminent in power.\" Laws of Menu, i. 61. The great code of law \"the  Hindus firmly believe to have been promulged in the beginning of time  by Menu, son or grandson of Brahma, or in plain English the first of  created beings, and not the oldest only but the noblest of  legislators.\" Sir W. JONES'S preface to Laws of Menu; Works, vii. 76.  In the Ramayana, in like manner, king Dasaratha is compared to the  ancient king, Menu. The word Manu, as the name of the ancestor of men,  is derived from the Sanscrit root Man, to know (WILSONin voce); in  the same manner as the Sanscrit Manisha, knowledge, Manushya, Man--as  also the Latin Mens, and the German Mensch. According to this  etymology, Man, Mensch, properly means \"the knowing,\" the Being  endowed with knowledge. The German word, Meinen, to mean, or be of  opinion, belongs to the same stock.]    [Footnote 7: p. 3. l. 9. _So there dwelt in high Vidarbha_. This city  is called by our poet Vidarbha Nagara, the city of Vidarbha, and  Cundina. According to Wilford it is Burra Nag-poor. BOPP. Colebrooke,  Asiatic Researches, remarks, that some suppose it to be the modern  Berar, which borders on the mountain Vindhya or Gondwanah. The kingdom  of Vidarbha, and its capital Kundini, are mentioned in the very  remarkable drama Malati and Madhava.

There is a play upon the words, Bhima meaning  terrible.]    [Footnote 9: p. 3. l. 11. _Many a holy act, on offspring_. He made  offerings and performed penance, by which blessings were forced from  the reluctant gods. In India not only temporal, but eternal happiness,  depends on having children. The son alone by the offering of the  Sraddha, or libation for the dead, can obtain rest for the departed  spirit of the father. Hence the begetting of a son is a religious  duty, particularly for a Brahmin, and is one of the three debts to  which he is bound during life. After he has read the Vedas in the form  prescribed by Law, has legally begotten a son, and has performed  sacrifices to the best of his power, he has paid his three debts, and  may then apply his heart to eternal bliss. MENU, vi. 36. By a son a  man obtains victory over all people; by a son's son he enjoys  immortality; and afterwards, by the son of that grandson, he reaches  the solar abode. MENU, ix. 137.    This last passage is immediately followed by the explanation of the  Sanscrit word Puttra, son, by \"the deliverer from hell.\" Since the son  (trayate) delivers his father from the hell, named put, he was  therefore called puttra by Brahma himself. This explanation, which it  given by the Indian etymologists, appears nevertheless, as is often  the case, rather forced; since the final syllable, tra, which is  translated by deliver (or preserve, WILSON, in voce) is a common  ending of many words, without the peculiar signification of  delivering: as with this final syllable on the word Pu, to be pure, is  formed the noun Puwitra, pure. WILKINS, Grammar, p. 454; KOSEGARTEN.  The affix with which this last is formed however, is not tra, but  itra, and it affords therefore no ground of objection to the usual  etymology of Puttra. WILSON.    The Indian poetry is full of instances of this strong desire for  offspring. In the Ramayana, king Dasaratha performs the Aswamedha, or  offering of a horse, to obtain a son. \"To this magnanimous king,  acquainted in every duty, pre-eminent in virtue, and performing sacred  austerities for the sake of obtaining children, there was no son to  perpetuate his family. At length in the anxious mind of this noble one  the thought arose, 'Why do I not perform an Ushwamedha to obtain a  son.'\" CAREY and MARSHMAN's translation, sect. viii. p. 74. Compare  the Raghu Vansa, canto i., and all that is done by king Dilipa to  obtain a son: and the poem of the death of Hidimbha, published by  Bopp.]    [Footnote 10: p. 3. l. 14. _--in his hospitable hall_. Hospitality to  a Brahmin is of course one of the greatest virtues. \"A Brahmin coming  as a guest, and not received with just honour, takes to himself all  the reward of the housekeeper's former virtue, even though he had been  so temperate as to live on the gleanings of harvests, and so pious as  to make oblations in five distinct fires.\" Sir W. JONES, Menu, iii.  100.]    [Footnote 11: p. 3. l. 22. _--as around great Indra's queen_. Sachi.        Sachi, soft as morning light,      Blithe Sachi, from her lord Indrani hight.--Sir W. JONES's Hymn to Indra.]    [Footnote 12: p. 4. l. 2. _Mid her handmaids, like the lightning_.  There are two words of similar signification in the original; one of  them implies life-giving. Lightning in India being the forerunner of  the rainy season, is looked on as an object of delight as much as  terror.

JONES's Ode to Lacshmi.]    [Footnote 14: p. 4. l. 4. _--never mid the Yaksha race_. The Yakshas  are demigods attendant on Kuvera, the god of wealth, descendants of  Kasyapa by his wife Khasa. They inhabit mountains, and have  intercourse with the Apsarasas, or heavenly nymphs. Sometimes they  appear not altogether as good beings, sometimes entirely harmless.  \"The souls of men enslaved to their passions will rise no higher than  the Yakshas.\" MENU, xii. 47. The subject of the Meghaduta, or  Cloud-Messenger of Kalidasa, so elegantly translated by Mr. Wilson, is  the regret of a Yaksha for his beloved wife.

In  the original this is a far less poetic bird, and the author must crave  forgiveness for having turned his geese into swans.

With my boy, who  learned to speak rather late, and was not occupied with learning by  heart, the following was the order of the perfectly pure sounds heard by  me:    On the left are the sounds or syllables indicated by one letter; on the  right, the same indicated by more than one letter; and it is to be borne  in mind that the child needs to pronounce only fourteen of the nineteen  so-called consonants of the German alphabet in order to master the  remaining five also; for        c = ts and k      v = f and w      x = ks and gs      q = ku and kw      z = ts and ds    and of the fourteen four require no new articulation, because        p is a toneless b      t is a toneless d      f is a toneless w      k is a toneless g    Of the ten positions of the mouth required for all the consonants of the  alphabet, nine are taken by the child within the first six months:*             Months.       1.

Every such chronological view of the sequence of sounds is uncertain,  because we can not observe the child uninterruptedly, and hence the  first appearance of a new sound easily escapes notice. The above  synopsis has a chronological value only so far as this, that it  announces, concerning every single sound, that such sound was heard in  its purity by me at least as early as the given month. The sound may,  however, have been uttered considerably earlier without my hearing it. I  know from personal experience that in other children many sounds appear  much earlier; in my child, e. g., _ngae_ was observed too late, and I  have no doubt that the first utterance of _f_ and _w_ was unobserved,  although I was on the lookout for them. When it is maintained, on the  contrary, that _m_ is not heard from a normal child until the tenth  month, then the _am_ and _moe_ which appear universally in the first  half-year have escaped notice. Earlier tabular views of this sort, which  have even served as a foundation for instruction of deaf-mutes in  speaking, do not rest exclusively on observation. Besides, in this  matter, even two children hardly agree. According to my observations, I  am compelled in spite of this disagreement to lay down the proposition  as valid for all healthy children, that the greatly _preponderating  majority of the sounds the child makes use of after learning verbal  language, and many other sounds besides these, are correctly formed by  him within the first eight months_, not intentionally, but just as much  at random as any other utterance of sound not to be used later in  speech, not appearing in any civilized language. I will only mention as  an example the labio-lingual explosive sound, in which the tip of the  tongue comes between the lips and, with an expiration, bursting from its  confinement is drawn back swiftly (with or without tone). All children  seem to like to form this sound, a sound between _p_, _b_, and _t_, _d_;  but it exists in few languages.    Among the innumerable superfluous, unintentional, random, muscular  movements of the infant, the movements of the muscles of the larynx,  mouth, and tongue take a conspicuous place, because they ally  themselves readily with acoustic effects and the child takes delight  in them. It is not surprising, therefore, that precisely those  vibrations of the vocal cords, precisely those shapings of the cavity  of the mouth, and those positions of the lips, often occur which we  observe in the utterance of our vowels, and that among the  child-noises produced unconsciously and in play are found almost all  our consonants and, besides, many that are used in foreign languages.  The plasticity of the apparatus of speech in youth permits the  production of a greater abundance of sounds and sound-combinations  than is employed later, and not a single child has been observed who  has, in accordance with the principle of the least effort (_principe  du moindre effort_) applied by French authors to this province,  advanced in regular sequence from the sounds articulated easily--i. e.,  with less activity of will--to the physiologically difficult;  rather does it hold good for all the children I have observed, and  probably for all children that learn to speak, that many of the sounds  uttered by them at the beginning, in the speechless season of infancy,  without effort and then forgotten, have to be learned afresh at a  later period, have to be painstakingly acquired by means of imitation.    Mobility and perfection in the _technique_ of sound-formation are not  speech. They come into consideration in the process of learning to speak  as facilitating the process, because the muscles are perfected by  previous practice; but the very first attempts to imitate voluntarily a  sound heard show how slight this advantage is. Even those primitive  syllables which the child of himself often pronounces to weariness, like  _da_, he can not at the beginning (in the tenth month in my case) as yet  say after any one, although he makes manifest by his effort--a regular  strain--by his attention, and his unsuccessful attempts, that he would  like to say them, as I have already mentioned. The reason is to be  looked for in the still incomplete development of the sensori-motor  central paths. In place of _tatta_ is sounded _tae_ or _ata_; in place of  _papa_ even _tai_, and this not once only, but after a great many trials  repeated again and again with the utmost patience. That the sound-image  has been correctly apprehended is evident from the certainty with which  the child responds correctly in various cases by gestures to words of  similar sound unpronounceable by him. Thus, he points by mistake once  only to the mouth (Mund) instead of the moon (Mond), and points  correctly to the ear (Ohr) and the clock (Uhr) when asked where these  objects are. The acuteness of hearing indispensable for repeating the  sounds is therefore present before the ability to repeat.    On the whole, the infant or the young child already weaned must be  placed higher at this stage of his mental development than a very  intelligent animal, but not on account of his knowledge of language, for  the dog also understands very well single words in the speech of his  master, in addition to hunting-terms. He divines, from the master's  looks and gestures, the meaning of whole sentences, and, although he has  not been brought to the point of producing articulate sounds, yet much  superior in this respect is the performance of the cockatoo, which  learns all articulate sounds. A child who shows by looks and gestures  and actions that he understands single words, and who already pronounces  correctly many words by imitation without understanding them, does not  on this account stand higher intellectually than a sagaciously  calculating yet speechless elephant or an Arabian horse, but because he  already forms many more and far more complex concepts.    The animal phase of intellect lasts, in the sound, vigorous, and not  neglected child, to the end of the first year of life at the farthest;  and long before the close of this he has, by means of the _feelings_ of  pleasure and of discomfort, very definitely distinguishable by him even  in the first days of life, but for which he does not get the verbal  expressions till the second and third year, formed for himself at least  in one province, viz., that of food, _ideas_ more or less well defined.  Romanes also rightly remarks that the _concept_ of food arises in us  through the feeling of hunger quite independently of language. Probably  this concept is the very first that is formed by the quite young infant,  only he would not name it \"food,\" if indeed he named it at all, but  would understand by it everything that puts an end to the feeling of  hunger. It is of great importance to hold firmly to this"]]]
