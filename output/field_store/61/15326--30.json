The  Kansas Supreme Court in Coleman _v._ Miller (146 Kan. 390 [1937]) came  to the opposite conclusion.    On October 1, 1937, 27 States had ratified the proposed amendment. Of  these States 10 had previously rejected the amendment on one or more  occasions. At least 26 different States have at one time rejected the  amendment.    [m] The 21st Amendment was proposed by Congress on February 20, 1933,  when it passed the House [Cong. Rec. (72d Cong., 2d sess.) 4516], having  previously passed the Senate on February 16 [_Id._, 4231]. It appears  officially in 47 Stat. 1625. Ratification was completed on December 5,  1933, when the thirty-sixth State (Utah) approved the amendment, there  being then 48 States in the Union. On December 5, 1933, Acting Secretary  of State Phillips certified that it had been adopted by the requisite  number of States [48 Stat. 1749].    The several State conventions ratified the 21st Amendment on the  following dates: Michigan, April 10, 1933; Wisconsin, April 25, 1933;  Rhode Island, May 8, 1933; Wyoming, May 25, 1933; New Jersey, June 1,  1933; Delaware, June 24, 1933; Indiana, June 26, 1933; Massachusetts,  June 26, 1933; New York, June 27, 1933; Illinois, July 10, 1933; Iowa,  July 10, 1933; Connecticut, July 11, 1933; New Hampshire, July 11, 1933;  California, July 24, 1933; West Virginia, July 25, 1933; Arkansas,  August 1, 1933; Oregon, August 7, 1933; Alabama, August 8, 1933;  Tennessee, August 11, 1933; Missouri, August 29, 1933; Arizona,  September 5, 1933; Nevada, September 5, 1933; Vermont, September 23,  1933; Colorado, September 26, 1933; Washington, October 3, 1933;  Minnesota, October 10, 1933; Idaho, October 17, 1933; Maryland, October  18, 1933; Virginia, October 25, 1933; New Mexico, November 2, 1933;  Florida, November 14, 1933; Texas, November 24, 1933; Kentucky, November  27, 1933; Ohio, December 5, 1933; Pennsylvania, December 5, 1933; Utah,  December 5, 1933; Maine, December 6, 1933; Montana, August 6, 1934. The  amendment was rejected by a convention in the State of South Carolina,  on December 4, 1933. The electorate of the State of North Carolina voted  against holding a convention at a general election held on November 7,  1933.    [n] The twenty-second Amendment was proposed by Congress on March 24,  1947, having passed the House on March 21, 1947 [Cong. Rec. (80th Cong.,  1st sess.) 2392] and having previously passed the Senate on March 12,  1947 [Id. 1978]. It appears officially in 61 Stat. 959. Ratification was  completed on February 27, 1951, when the thirty-sixth State (Minnesota)  approved the amendment; there being then 48 States in the Union. On  March 1, 1951, Jess Larson, Administrator of General Services, certified  that it had been adopted by the requisite number of States [16 F.R.  2019].    A total of 41 State legislatures ratified the Twenty-second Amendment on  the following dates: Maine, March 31, 1947; Michigan, March 31, 1947;  Iowa, April 1, 1947; Kansas, April 1, 1947; New Hampshire, April 1,  1947; Delaware, April 2, 1947; Illinois, April 3, 1947; Oregon, April 3,  1947; Colorado, April 12, 1947; California, April 15, 1947; New Jersey,  April 15, 1947; Vermont, April 15, 1947; Ohio, April 16, 1947;  Wisconsin; April 16, 1947; Pennsylvania, April 29, 1947; Connecticut,  May 21, 1947; Missouri, May 22, 1947; Nebraska, May 23, 1947; Virginia,  January 28, 1948; Mississippi, February 12, 1948; New York, March 9,  1948; South Dakota, January 21, 1949; North Dakota, February 25, 1949;  Louisiana, May 17, 1950; Montana, January 25, 1951; Indiana, January 29,  1951; Idaho, January 30, 1951; New Mexico, February 12, 1951; Wyoming,  February 12, 1951; Arkansas, February 15, 1951; Georgia, February 17,  1951; Tennessee, February 20, 1951; Texas, February 22, 1951; Utah,  February 26, 1951; Nevada, February 26, 1951; Minnesota, February 27,  1951; North Carolina, February 28, 1951; South Carolina, March 13, 1951;  Maryland, March 14, 1951; Florida, April 16, 1951; and Alabama, May 4,  1951.          THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITH ANNOTATIONS      PREAMBLE    The Preamble:                                                   Page    Purpose and effect                                              59    \"The people of the United States\"                               59      THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITH ANNOTATIONS      The Preamble    We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect  Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the  common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of  Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this  Constitution for the United States of America.      Purpose and Effect of the Preamble    Although the preamble is not a source of power for any department of the  Federal Government,[1] the Supreme Court has often referred to it as  evidence of the origin, scope, and purpose of the Constitution. \"Its  true office\" wrote Joseph Story in his Commentaries, \"is to expound the  nature and extent and application of the powers actually conferred by  the Constitution, and not substantively to create them. For example, the  preamble declares one object to be, 'to provide for the common defense.'  No one can doubt that this does not enlarge the powers of Congress to  pass any measures which they deem useful for the common defence. But  suppose the terms of a given power admit of two constructions, the one  more restrictive, the other more liberal, and each of them is consistent  with the words, but is, and ought to be, governed by the intent of the  power; if one could promote and the other defeat the common defence,  ought not the former, upon the soundest principles of interpretation, to  be adopted?\"[2] Moreover, the preamble bears witness to the fact that  the Constitution emanated from the people, and was not the act of  sovereign and independent States,[3] and that it was made for, and is  binding only in, the United States of America.[4] In the Dred Scott  case,[5] Chief Justice Taney declared that: \"The words 'people of the  United States' and 'citizens' are synonymous terms, and mean the same  thing. They both describe the political body who, according to our  republican institutions, form the sovereignty, and who hold the power  and conduct the Government through their representatives. They are what  we familiarly call the 'sovereign people,' and every citizen is one of  this people, and a constituent member of this sovereignty.\"[6]      Notes    [1] Jacobson _v._ Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 22 (1905).

In the first battle in which Jackson took part, the confused struggle at  Bull Run, he gained his name of Stonewall from the firmness with which  he kept his men to their work and repulsed the attack of the Union  troops. From that time until his death, less than two years afterward,  his career was one of brilliant and almost uninterrupted success;  whether serving with an independent command in the Valley, or acting  under Lee as his right arm in the pitched battles with McClellan, Pope,  and Burnside. Few generals as great as Lee have ever had as great a  lieutenant as Jackson. He was a master of strategy and tactics, fearless  of responsibility, able to instil into his men his own intense ardor  in battle, and so quick in his movements, so ready to march as well as  fight, that his troops were known to the rest of the army as the \"foot  cavalry.\"    In the spring of 1863 Hooker had command of the Army of the Potomac.  Like McClellan, he was able to perfect the discipline of his forces  and to organize them, and as a division commander he was better  than McClellan, but he failed even more signally when given a great  independent command. He had under him 120,000 men when, toward the  end of April, he prepared to attack Lee's army, which was but half as  strong.    The Union army lay opposite Fredericksburg, looking at the fortified  heights where they had received so bloody a repulse at the beginning of  the winter. Hooker decided to distract the attention of the Confederates  by letting a small portion of his force, under General Sedgwick, attack  Fredericksburg, while he himself took the bulk of the army across the  river to the right hand so as to crush Lee by an assault on his flank.  All went well at the beginning, and on the first of May Hooker found  himself at Chancellorsville, face-to-face with the bulk of Lee's  forces; and Sedgwick, crossing the river and charging with the utmost  determination, had driven out of Fredericksburg the Confederate division  of Early; but when Hooker found himself in front of Lee he hesitated,  faltered instead of pushing on, and allowed the consummate general to  whom he was opposed to take the initiative.    Lee fully realized his danger, and saw that his only chance was, first  to beat back Hooker, and then to turn and overwhelm Sedgwick, who was in  his rear. He consulted with Jackson, and Jackson begged to be allowed  to make one of his favorite flank attacks upon the Union army; attacks  which could have been successfully delivered only by a skilled and  resolute general, and by troops equally able to march and to fight. Lee  consented, and Jackson at once made off. The country was thickly covered  with a forest of rather small growth, for it was a wild region, in which  there was still plenty of game. Shielded by the forest, Jackson marched  his gray columns rapidly to the left along the narrow country roads  until he was square on the flank of the Union right wing, which was held  by the Eleventh Corps, under Howard. The Union scouts got track of the  movement and reported it at headquarters, but the Union generals thought  the Confederates were retreating; and when finally the scouts brought  word to Howard that he was menaced by a flank attack he paid no heed to  the information, and actually let his whole corps be surprised in broad  daylight. Yet all the while the battle was going on elsewhere, and  Berdan's sharpshooters had surrounded and captured a Georgia regiment,  from which information was received showing definitely that Jackson was  not retreating, and must be preparing to strike a heavy blow.    The Eleventh Corps had not the slightest idea that it was about to be  assailed. The men were not even in line. Many of them had stacked their  muskets and were lounging about, some playing cards, others cooking  supper, intermingled with the pack-mules and beef cattle. While they  were thus utterly unprepared Jackson's gray-clad veterans pushed  straight through the forest and rushed fiercely to the attack. The first  notice the troops of the Eleventh Corps received did not come from the  pickets, but from the deer, rabbits and foxes which, fleeing from their  coverts at the approach of the Confederates, suddenly came running over  and into the Union lines. In another minute the frightened pickets came  tumbling back, and right behind them came the long files of charging,  yelling Confederates; With one fierce rush Jackson's men swept over  the Union lines, and at a blow the Eleventh Corps became a horde of  panicstruck fugitives. Some of the regiments resisted for a few moments,  and then they too were carried away in the flight.    For a while it seemed as if the whole army would be swept off; but  Hooker and his subordinates exerted every effort to restore order. It  was imperative to gain time so that the untouched portions of the army  could form across the line of the Confederate advance.    Keenan's regiment of Pennsylvania cavalry, but four hundred sabers  strong, was accordingly sent full against the front of the ten thousand  victorious Confederates.    Keenan himself fell, pierced by bayonets, and the charge was repulsed  at once; but a few priceless moments had been saved, and Pleasanton had  been given time to post twenty-two guns, loaded with double canister,  where they would bear upon the enemy.    The Confederates advanced in a dense mass, yelling and cheering, and the  discharge of the guns fairly blew them back across the work's they had  just taken. Again they charged, and again were driven back; and when the  battle once more began the Union reinforcements had arrived.    It was about this time that Jackson himself was mortally wounded. He had  been leading and urging on the advance of his men, cheering them with  voice and gesture, his pale face flushed with joy and excitement,  while from time to time as he sat on his horse he took off his hat and,  looking upward, thanked heaven for the victory it had vouchsafed him.  As darkness drew near he was in the front, where friend and foe were  mingled in almost inextricable confusion. He and his staff were fired  at, at close range, by the Union troops, and, as they turned, were fired  at again, through a mistake, by the Confederates behind them. Jackson  fell, struck in several places. He was put in a litter and carried back;  but he never lost consciousness, and when one of his generals complained  of the terrible effect of the Union cannonade he answered:    \"You must hold your ground.\"    For several days he lingered, hearing how Lee beat Hooker, in detail,  and forced him back across the river. Then the old Puritan died. At the  end his mind wandered, and he thought he was again commanding in battle,  and his last words were.    \"Let us cross over the river and rest in the shade.\"    Thus perished Stonewall Jackson, one of the ablest of soldiers and one  of the most upright of men, in the last of his many triumphs.          THE CHARGE AT GETTYSBURG          For the Lord        On the whirlwind is abroad;       In the earthquake he has spoken;        He has smitten with his thunder        The iron walls asunder,       And the gates of brass are broken!                       --Whittier         With bray of the trumpet,        And roll of the drum,       And keen ring of bugle        The cavalry come:       Sharp clank the steel scabbards,        The bridle-chains ring,       And foam from red nostrils        The wild chargers fling!         Tramp, tramp o'er the greensward        That quivers below,       Scarce held by the curb bit        The fierce horses go!       And the grim-visaged colonel,        With ear-rending shout,       Peals forth to the squadrons        The order, \"Trot Out\"!                     --Francis A. Durivage.      The battle of Chancellorsville marked the zenith of Confederate good  fortune. Immediately afterward, in June, 1863, Lee led the victorious  army of Northern Virginia into Pennsylvania. The South was now the  invader, not the invaded, and its heart beat proudly with hopes of  success; but these hopes went down in bloody wreck on July 4, when word  was sent to the world that the high valor of Virginia had failed at last  on the field of Gettysburg, and that in the far West Vicksburg had been  taken by the army of the \"silent soldier.\"    At Gettysburg Lee had under him some seventy thousand men, and his  opponent, Meade, about ninety thousand. Both armies were composed mainly  of seasoned veterans, trained to the highest point by campaign after  campaign and battle after battle; and there was nothing to choose  between them as to the fighting power of the rank and file. The Union  army was the larger, yet most of the time it stood on the defensive;  for the difference between the generals, Lee and Meade, was greater  than could be bridged by twenty thousand men. For three days the battle  raged. No other battle of recent time has been so obstinate and so  bloody. The victorious Union army lost a greater percentage in killed  and wounded than the allied armies of England, Germany, and the  Netherlands lost at Waterloo. Four of its seven corps suffered each a  greater relative loss than befell the world-renowned British infantry  on the day that saw the doom of the French emperor. The defeated  Confederates at Gettysburg lost, relatively, as many men as the defeated  French at Waterloo; but whereas the French army became a mere rabble,  Lee withdrew his formidable soldiery with their courage unbroken, and  their fighting power only diminished by their actual losses in the  field.
