The supernatant liquid will exhibit a fine blue  colour, if the minutest quantity of copper be present.    Green tea, coloured with carbonate of copper, when thrown into water  impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas, immediately acquires a black  colour. Genuine green tea suffers no change from the action of these  tests.    The presence of copper may be further rendered obvious, by mixing one  part of the suspected tea-leaves, reduced to powder, with two or three  parts of nitrate of potash, (or with two parts of chlorate of potash,)  and projecting this mixture by small portions at a time, into a platina,  or porcelain-ware crucible, kept red-hot in a coal fire; the whole  vegetable matter of the tea leaves will thus become destroyed, and the  oxide of copper left behind, in combination with the potash, of the  nitrate of potash (or salt-petre,) or with the muriate of potash, if  chlorate of potash has been employed.    If water, acidulated with nitric acid, be then poured into the crucible  to dissolve the mass, the presence of the copper may be rendered  manifest by adding to the solution, liquid ammonia, in such quantity  that the pungent odour of it predominates.

[86] The examination of twenty-seven samples of imitation tea of  different qualities, from the most costly, to the most common, which it  fell to my lot to undertake, induces me to point out the marks of  sophistications here detailed, as the most simple and expeditious.    [87] Mr. Twining, an eminent tea-merchant, asserts, that \"the leaves of  spurious tea are boiled in a copper, with copperas and sheep's  dung.\"--See Encyclop. Britan. vol. xviii. p. 331. 1797. See also the  History of the Tea Plant, p. 48; and p. 167 of this Treatise.          _Counterfeit Coffee._      The fraud of counterfeiting ground coffee by means of pigeon's beans and  pease, is another subject which, not long ago, arrested the attention of  the public: and from the numerous convictions of grocers prosecuted for  the offence, it is evident that this practice has been carried on for a  long time, and to a considerable extent.    The following statement exhibits some of the prosecutions, instituted by  the Solicitor of the Excise, against persons convicted of the fraud of  manufacturing spurious, and adulterating genuine coffee.    Alexander Brady, a grocer, (_See p. 182_) prosecuted and convicted of  selling _sham-coffee_, said, \"I have sold it for twenty years.\" Some of  the persons prosecuted by the Solicitor of the Excise for this fraud, we  might, at first sight, be inclined to believe, were inconscious that the  adulterating of genuine coffee with spurious substances was illegal; but  this ignorance affords no excuse, as the Act of the 43 Geo. III. cap.  129, explicitly states: \"If after the first day of September, 1803, any  burnt, scorched, or roasted pease, beans, or other grain, or vegetable  substance or substances prepared or manufactured for the purpose of  being in imitation of or in any respect to resemble coffee or cocoa, or  to serve as a substitute for coffee or cocoa, or alleged or pretended by  the possessor or vender thereof so to be, _shall be made_, or kept for  sale, or shall be _offered_ or _exposed to sale_, or shall be _found_ in  the custody or possession of any _dealer_ or dealers in or _seller_ or  sellers of _coffee_, or if any burnt, scorched, or roasted pease, beans,  or other grain, or vegetable substance or substances not being coffee,  shall be called by the preparer, manufacturer, possessor, or vender  thereof, by the name of _English_ or _British_ coffee, or _any other  name_ of coffee, or by the name of _American_ cocoa, or _English_ or  _British_ cocoa, or any other name of cocoa, the same respectively shall  be forfeited, together with the packages containing the same, and shall  and may be seized by any officer or officers of Excise; and the person  or persons preparing, manufacturing, or selling the same, or having the  same in his, her, or their custody or possession, or the dealer or  dealers in or seller or sellers of coffee or cocoa, in whose custody  the same shall be found, shall forfeit and lose the sum of one hundred  pounds.\"    _The Attorney-General against William Malins._--This was an information  filed by the Attorney-General against the defendant, charging him, he  being a dealer in coffee, with having in his possession a large quantity  of imitation coffee, made from scorched pease and beans, resembling  coffee, and intended to be sold as such, contrary to the statute of the  43d of the King, whereby he became liable to pay a fine of 100_l._    J. Lawes deposed that he had lived servant with the defendant; he  constantly roasted pease and beans, and ground them into powder. When so  ground, the powder very much resembled coffee. Sometimes the sweepings  of the coffee were thrown in among the pease and beans. Witness carried  out this powder to several grocers in different parts of the town.    Thomas Jones lived with the defendant. His occupation was roasting and  grinding pease and beans. They looked, when ground, the same as coffee.  Witness had seen Mr. John Malins sweep up the refuse coffee, and mix it  with the pease and beans. He had taken out this mixture to grocers.    J. Richardson, an excise-officer, deposed, that, in December 1817, he  went to the premises of the defendant, and there seized four sacks, five  tubs, and nine pounds in paper, of a powder made to resemble coffee. The  quantity ground was 1,567 pounds; it had all the appearance of coffee;  and a little coffee being mixed with it, any common person might be  deceived. He also seized two sacks, containing 279 pounds of whole pease  and beans roasted. Among the latter were some grains of coffee. The  witness here produced samples of the articles seized.    John Lawes deposed, that the articles exhibited were such as he was in  the habit of manufacturing while in Mr. Malins' employment.    The jury found a verdict for the Crown.--Penalty 100_l._    _The King against Chaloner._--Mr. Chaloner, a dealer in tea and coffee,  was charged on the oaths of Charles Henry Lord and John Pearson, both  Excise officers, with having in his possession, on the 17th of March,  nine pounds of spurious coffee, consisting of burnt pease, beans, and  gravel or sand, and a portion of coffee, and with selling some of the  same; also with having in his possession seventeen pounds of vegetable  powder, and an article imitating coffee, which contained not a particle  of genuine coffee.    The defendant was convicted in the penalty of 90_l._    _The King against Peether._--This was an information against Mr. Thomas  Peether, tea and coffee dealer, charging him with having in his  possession a quantity of imitation coffee (or vegetable powder) on the  25th of April last.    The case being proved by the evidence of several witnesses, the  defendant was convicted in the penalty of 50_l._    _The King against Topping._--This was an information against Mr. John  Lewis Topping, a dealer in tea and coffee, charging him with having  thirty-seven pounds of vegetable powder in his possession. The article  seized was produced to the commissioners of the Excise.    The defendant was convicted in the penalty of 50_l._    _The King against Samuel Hallett._--The defendant, Hallett, a grocer and  dealer in tea and coffee, was charged with having seven pounds of  imitation coffee in his possession.    Charles Henry Lord, an officer of the Excise, being sworn, stated, that  he and Spencer, an officer, went, on the 28th of February last, to the  shop of the defendant, and asked for an ounce of coffee, at three  halfpence per ounce. He received the same, and having paid for it, left  the shop. He examined the article, and found it was part coffee, and  part imitation coffee, or what the defendant called vegetable powder,  which is nothing more nor less than burnt pease and beans ground in a  mill.    Spencer, the officer of the Excise, corroborated the above evidence, and  stated, that the sham-coffee seized at the defendant's house was shown  to Mr. Joseph Hubbard, grocer, and tea and coffee dealer, in  High-street, in the Borough of Southwark.    Mr. Hubbard being sworn, stated, that he had examined the sham-coffee  seized by the officers in the defendant's shop. The one ounce purchased  by Lord, he knew to be nothing else than black pigeon's beans; there was  no coffee amongst it.    The defendant was convicted in the penalty of 50_l._    _The King against Fox._--Mr. Edward Fox, grocer, and dealer in tea and  coffee, was charged with having a large quantity of sham-coffee in his  possession, and with selling the same for genuine coffee.    Henry Spencer, an officer of the Excise, stated, that on the 21st of  February he and Lord, another officer, went to the defendant's shop and  purchased an ounce of coffee, for which he paid three halfpence. They  examined it, and he was satisfied it was not genuine coffee; they  purchased another ounce (which he produced to the commissioners of the  Excise, who examined it); they were convinced it consisted partly of  coffee and beans and pease.    The defendant, in his defence said, that the poor people wanted a  low-price article; and by mixing the vegetable powder and coffee  together, he was able to sell it at three halfpence an ounce; he had  sold it for years; he did it as a matter of accommodation to the poor,  who could not give a higher price; he did not sell it for genuine  coffee.    _Commissioner._--\"Then you have been defrauding the public for many  years, and injuring the revenue by your illicit practices: the poor have  an equal right to be supplied with as genuine an article as the rich.\"    He was convicted in the penalty of 50_l._    _The King against Brady._--The defendant, Mr. Alexander Brady, grocer,  and dealer in tea"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#20)"],[1,"litically, is so far away from the  experience or knowledge of the American, that he must be given certain  facts to assist his imagination in making a true picture. I have done  this, too, that the Kaiser may have his real background when we  undertake to place him understandingly in the modern world. Here we  have patriarchal rule still strong and still undoubting, coupled with  the most successful social legislation, the most successful state  control of railways, mines, and other enterprises; and a progress  commercial and industrial during the last quarter of a century, second  to none.    This ruler believes it to be essentially a part of his business to be  a Lorenzo de Medici to his people in art; their high priest in  religion; their envoy extraordinary to foreign peoples; their watchful  father and friend in legislation dealing with their daily lives; their  war-lord, and their best example in all that concerns domestic  happiness and patriotic citizenship. He fulfils the words of the old  German chronicle which reads: \"Merito a nobis nostrisque posteris  pater patriae appelatur quia erat egregius defensor et fortissimus  propugnator nihili pendens vitam suam contra omnia adversa propter  justitiam opponere.\"    If history is not altogether valueless in its description of symptoms,  the Germans are of a softer mould than some of us, more malleable,  rather tempted to imitate than led by self-confidence to trust to  their own ideals, and less hard in confronting the demands of other  peoples, that they should accept absorption by them.    Spurned and disdained by Louis XIV, they fawned upon him, built  palaces like his, dressed like his courtiers, wrote and spoke his  language, copied his literary models, and even bored themselves with  mistresses because this was the fashion at Versailles. He stole from  them, only to be thrown the kisses of flattery in return. He sneered  at them, only to be begged for his favors in return. He took their  cities in time of peace, and they acknowledged the theft by a smirking  adulation that he allowed one of their number to be crowned a king.    As for Napoleon, he performed a prolonged autopsy upon the Germans.  They were dismembered or joined together as suited his plans. At his  beck they fought against one another, or against Russia, or against  England. He tossed them crowns, that they still wear proudly, as a  master tosses biscuits to obedient spaniels. He put his poor relatives  to rule over them, here and there, and they were grateful. He marched  into their present capital, took away their monuments, and the sword  of Frederick the Great, and they hailed him with tears and rejoicing  as their benefactor, while their wittiest poet and sweetest singer,  lauded him to the skies.    It is unpleasant to recall, but quite unfair to forget, these  happenings of the last two hundred years in the history of the German  people. What would any man say, after this, was their greatest need,  if not self-confidence; if not twenty-five years of peace to enable  them to recover from their beatings and humiliation; if not a powerful  army and navy to give them the sense of security, by which alone  prosperity and pride in their accomplishments and in themselves can be  fostered; if not a ruler who holds ever before their eyes their ideals  and the unfaltering energy required of them to attain them!    What nation would not be self-conscious after such dire experiences?  What nation would not be tenderly sensitive as to its treatment by  neighboring powers? What nation would not be even unduly keen to  resent any appearance of an attempt to jostle it from its hard-won  place in the sun? Their self-consciousness and sensitiveness and  vanity are patent, but they are pardonable. As the leader of the  Conservative party in the Reichstag, Doctor von Heydebrandt, speaking  at Breslau in October, 1911, anent the Morocco controversy, said,  after, alluding to the \"bellicose impudence\" of Lloyd-George: \"The  [British] ministry thrusts its fist under our nose, and declares, I  alone command the world. It is bitterly hard for us who have 1870  behind us.\" They feel that they should no longer be treated to such  bumptiousness.    I trust that I am no swashbuckler, but I have the greatest sympathy  with the present Emperor in his capacity as war-lord, and in his  insistent stiffening of Germany's martial backbone.    When shall we all recover from a certain international sickliness that  keeps us all feverish? The continual talk and writing about  international friendships, being of the same family, or the same race,  the cousin propagandism in short, is irritating, not helpful. I do not  go to Germany to discover how American is Germany, nor to England to  discover how American is England; but to Germany to discover how  German is Germany, to England to see how English is England. I much  prefer Americans to either Germans or Englishmen, and they prefer  Germans or Englishmen, as the case may be, to Americans. What spurious  and milksoppy puppets we should be if it were not so. So long as there  are praters going about insisting that Germany, with a flaxen pig-tail  down her back, and England, in pumps instead of boots, and a poodle  instead of a bulldog, shall sit forever in the moonlight hand in hand;  or that America shall become a dandy, shave the chin-whisker, wear a  Latin Quarter butterfly tie of red, white, and blue, and thrum a banjo  to a little brown lady with oblique eyes and a fan, all day long; just  so long will the bulldog snarl, the flaxen-haired maiden look sulky,  the chin-whisker become stiffer and more provocative, and the  fluttering fan seem to threaten blows.    We have been surfeited with peace talk till we are all irritable. One  hundredth part of an ounce of the same quality of peace powders that  we are using internationally would, if prescribed to a happy family in  this or any other land, lead to dissensions, disobedience, domestic  disaster, and divorce. Mr. Carnegie will have lived long enough to see  more wars and international disturbances, and more discontent born of  superficial reading, than any man in history who was at the same time  so closely connected with their origin. Perhaps it were better after  all if our millionaires were educated!    The peace party need war just as the atheists need God, otherwise they  have nothing to deny, nothing to attack. Peace is a negative thing  that no one really wants, certainly not the kind of peace of which  there is so much talking to-day, which is a kind of castrated  patriotism. Peace is not that. Peace can never be born of such  impotency. When German statesmen declare roundly that they will not  discuss the question of disarmament, they are merely saying that they  will not be traitors to their country. If the Emperor rattles the  sabre occasionally, it is because the time has not come yet, when this  German people can be allowed to forget what they have suffered from  foreign conquerors, and what they must do to protect themselves from  such a repetition of history.    When the final judgment is passed upon the Emperor, we must recall his  deep religious feeling that he is inevitably an instrument of God; his  ingrained and ineradicable method of reading history as though it were  a series of the ipse dixits of kings; his complacent neglect of how  the work of the world is done by patient labor; of how works of art  are only born of travail and tears: his obsession by that curious  psychology of kings that leads them to believe that they are somehow  different, and under other laws, as though they lived in another  dimension of space. In addition, he is a man of unusually rapid mental  machinery, of overpowering self-confidence, of great versatility, of  many advantages of training and experience, and, above all, he is  unhampered. He is answerable directly to no one, to no parliament, to  no minister, to no people. He is father, guardian, guide, school-  master, and priest, but in no sense a servant responsible to any  master save one of his own choosing.    The only wonder is that he is not insupportable. Those who have come  under the spell of his personality declare him to be the most  delightful of companions; what Germany has grown to be under his reign  of twenty-five years all the world knows, much of the world envies,  some of the world fears; what his own people think of him can best be  expressed by the statement that his supremacy was never more assured  than to-day.    I agree that no one man can be credited with the astonishing expansion  of Germany in all directions in the last thirty years; but so  interwoven are the advice and influence, the ambitions and plans, of  the German Emperor with the progress of the German people, that this  one personality shares his country's successes as no single individual  in any other country can be said to do.    Whether he likes Americans or not one can hardly know. No doubt he has  made many of them think so; and, alas, we suffer from a national  hallucination that we are liked abroad, when as a matter of fact we  are no more liked than others; and in cultured centres we are in  addition, laughed at by the careless and sneered at by the sour.    That the Kaiser is liked by Americans, both by those who have met him  and by those who have not, is, I think, indisputable. He is of the  stuff that would have made a first-rate American. He would have been a  sovereign there as he is a sovereign here. He would have enjoyed the  risks, and turmoil, and competition; he would have enjoyed the fine,  free field of endeavor, and he would have jousted with the best of us  in our tournament of life, which has trained as many knights sans peur  et sans reproche as any country in the world.    I believe in a man who takes what he thinks belongs to him, and holds  it against the world; in the man who so loves life that he keeps a  hearty appetite for it and takes "]]]
