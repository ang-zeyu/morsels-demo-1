The  six need not all be put on meanwhile, but only those which are most  easily handled. The next size (Fig. 371) may then be put on.    In the ordinary course each arm could be completed with its three cross  pieces till the sixth was attempted, and here the reader would find that,  at the last moment, his attempt was frustrated. He could not get the  last small piece in, as other bars lock the puzzle. Here it is that the  \"key\" comes in.    THE KEY PIECE.--When the writer fits up the puzzle he finds that three of  the arms may straight away be fitted complete with their three cross  parts. These are the ones where the longer cross piece (Fig. 370) _lies  flush with the back of the central bar_ (see Fig. 377). This is easily  found out when at work on the puzzle. In the case of the other three arms  there is, of course, a gap caused by the long slots of the central bars.  Adjust the parts on the first-named three arms, and then deal with the  fourth arm, putting in all three cross parts. For the little one here,  use the \"key.\"    By placing the \"key\" so that it _overlaps the end projection_ of the arm  (see Fig. 378) a space is left at the centre, and means is thus afforded  for getting in the three cross parts on the remaining two arms.    This practically ends the puzzle. While the \"key\" is in its overlapping  position the parts may be separated, but if it is _turned round on its  narrow neck_, so that it is in exactly the same position as the other  five small cross parts, it locks the whole thing so tightly that nothing  but sheer force could loosen the twenty-one pieces.    So far as the order of putting together is concerned, there are many  equally satisfactory ways, these being determined by the ease or  difficulty that one experiences in holding the half-finished puzzle. It  all comes to the same in the end, and the \"key\" must be placed on one bar  before the last three arms can be completed. The \"key,\" moreover, must be  on one of the bars where a gap is left at the centre, and not on one  where Fig. 370 lies flush against the central arm as in Fig. 377.    UNDOING THE PUZZLE.--To take the puzzle to pieces all that is required is  to turn the \"key\" half round and push the other two cross bars on that  arm towards the outer point. The cross bars below may then be removed,  and the whole structure falls to pieces.    THE DOUBLE DOVETAIL PUZZLE (Fig. 379) consists of two pieces of wood  (usually one dark and the other light) which, upon examination, appear to  be dovetailed together from each face. This interlocking arrangement is  obviously impossible, and the solution of the puzzle is only apparent on  examining Fig. 380, where it will be seen that the joint fits together  diagonally.    At Fig. 381 are given the diagrams for setting out. Draw the outline of  the elevation, plan and end view. The end view in the first instance is  indicated by 3, 4, 5 and 6, and it measures 1-7/8 ins. square. A  1-7/8-ins. square is simply used because 2-ins. wood generally finishes  this size after it is planed up. Set out a square (A, B, C, D) which  stands corner-ways in the larger square (3, 4, 5, 6). Project the lines D  A and C B upwards as at 1, and on to this drawing (1), set out the  dovetail according to your own idea of length, width and bevel. Project  the four points of your dovetail downwards into the end view, and where  these lines cut A, B, and D, C draw them downwards and rebate them into  your original plan. This will give the true shape of the two dovetails  and it is to this shape that you will cut your joint.    The joint is in due course glued up, and next day you will plane and  waste off the four corners of your model. The end view shows one corner  shaded D, 3, A; this and the other three corners are wasted away. The  result is that the dovetails are thrown into a plane different from that  in which they were made, showing as Fig. 379.    [Illustration: Fig. 379.--Double Dovetail Puzzle.]    [Illustration: Fig. 380.--The Two Parts Separated.]    [Illustration: Fig. 381.--Elevation, Plan and End View, showing how the  Puzzle Joint may be correctly Set Out.]    [Illustration: Fig. 382.--Dovetail Puzzle. The Finished Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 383.--Sketch of Dovetail Piece.]    (Note that dovetail is cut on slant, the thickness at front being less  than at back. See dotted line on plan below.)    [Illustration: Fig. 384.--Plan, looking upwards.]    [Illustration: Fig. 385A.--Front Elevation.]    [Illustration: Fig. 385B.--Back Elevation.]    The model calls for very accurate workmanship and the joints must not be  _undercut_ during the sawing and chiselling operations. The completed  model measures 6 to 7 ins.    THE DOVETAIL PUZZLE joint illustrated at Fig. 382 has perhaps caused more  argument and controversy amongst woodworkers than any wooden joint. It  may be neatly made in maple, walnut, or mahogany, and afterwards glued  up. The question everyone asks is: How was it put together?    [Illustration: Fig. 386.--Variation of the Dovetail Puzzle.]    Take two pieces of wood such as mahogany, walnut or birch, about 6 ins.  long by 1-7/8 ins. wide and 1-1/4 ins. thick. Truly plane them up and  then set out and make the tenon and dovetailed piece (Fig. 383). Next  mark out and cut the cross bar to fit its corresponding piece. The joint  will go together in a somewhat diagonal direction as it is pushed into  position from the back; when closed it will appear as at Fig. 382. For  guidance, a plan, part elevation and back elevation are added.    An improvement after you have gained experience in the making of this  joint is to make a similar joint, leaving the face (B, Fig. 386) blind;  it then does not show the bevelling of the dovetail at the end C. In  other words, keep the line C, say, 1/4 in. back from the face of B. The  joint should be glued up and it will then appear to the average worker  that it is an impossible proposition. (See Fig. 401, page 208.)    [Illustration: Fig. 387.--A Simple Variation of the Dovetail Puzzle.]    Carefully note that the edges A, A are parallel to each other in spite of  the fact that they slope in one direction.    A further variation of the puzzle is seen in Fig. 387. Here the joint is  much simpler, and can easily be followed from the illustration.    [Illustration: Fig. 388.--Six-piece Joint Puzzle.]    CROSS PUZZLE.--Fig. 388 illustrates a six-piece puzzle joint, similar in  some respects to Fig. 369, but very much simpler. Both a back and front  view of the piece D is shown for clearness of illustration. The method of  assembling the pieces is as follows: Hold piece B upright, and fit piece  D across; at the same time note that the small _x_ marks are opposite  each other. Take piece E and, holding it as shown, slide it up the piece  B (see arrow) until E engages D and the small _o_ marks are opposite each  other. Piece C is now fitted behind D, and then piece F will slide in  position and push downwards. The key-piece A is now put in position, and  the puzzle is completed.    [Illustration: Fig. 389.--Mortising Puzzle, showing how the Parts Fit.]    MORTISING PUZZLE.--The ordinary mortising exercise is, after the first  two or three attempts, generally voted as uninteresting, but, although  the simple puzzle shown in Fig. 389 is practically an exercise in  mortising, yet, forming as it does a puzzle, it becomes a fascinating  piece of work.    The puzzle is composed of three pieces of wood, each 4 ins. long, 1-1/2  ins. wide, and 1/2 in. thick. In each piece a mortise 1-1/2 ins. by 1/2  in. should be cut as shown at 1, Fig. 390. In one piece, marked 2, a  groove is cut on one side, 3/8 in. wide, and in another piece (3) a  similar slot, but 1/2 in. wide, is cut, and this is continued on the  other side of the groove to a depth of 1/8 in. The three pieces should be  set out on a 13-ins. by 1-1/2-ins. by 1/2-in. length of wood, as shown at  Fig. 391, and when ready sawn apart.    [Illustration: Fig. 390.--The Three Parts, with Sizes marked.]    [Illustration: Fig. 391.--How to Cut the Parts.]    The puzzle is put together as shown at Fig. 389. In the first place, hold  No. 1 piece upright as shown at A, then take No. 2 piece with slot  uppermost and push it through the opening in No. 1 piece until the  nearest side of the slot projects 1/8 in. as indicated at B. Next place  No. 3 piece on with the slot at the back as shown at C, and push it down  until it touches the bottom of the opening in No. 2 piece as illustrated  at D. The only thing to do now is to push No. 2 piece as far as it will  go to make the figure as shown at E.    In this puzzle the parts should fit together fairly tight, but should not  be too stiff.    [Illustration: Fig. 392.--Chinese Cross Puzzle.]    [Illustration: Fig. 393.--Method of Putting Together.]    [Illustration: Fig. 394.--The Six Pieces, each 4 ins. by 1 in. square.]    CHINESE CROSS.--Fig. 392 shows a variation of the Chinese cross, which is  perhaps the most fascinating of all woodwork puzzles. Take six pieces of  hardwood (Fig. 394) and accurately plane and saw them so that each piece  will measure 4 ins. by 1 in. by 1 in. Bearing in mind that all the cuts  are multiples of 1/2 in., set out, saw and chisel five of the pieces to  agree with the sketches 1, 1A, 2, 2A and 3. Leave the key piece intact.  The puzzle is of course to fit all the six pieces together so as to form  the Chinese cross or block given at Fig. 392. As a clue to the method of  assembly we give another sketch (Fig. 393) showing four of the pieces  fixed together. The reader can, if he so desires, make the puzzle to a  smaller scale by using six pieces of wood each measuring 2 ins. long by  1/2 in. by 1/2 in.    [Illustration: Fig. 395--Diagonal Chinese Cross Puzzle. (Two Pieces  required of A, Three of B and One of C.)]    DIAGONAL CHINESE CROSS.--At Fig. 395 is given a sketch of a completed  Chinese block or cross puzzle in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#20)"],[1,"enote: Outside Cut by Lining]    After the lining is fitted, it is ripped apart, the outside cut, basted  to it and the seams are basted, beginning at the waist line. Never use a  long thread in basting and always use short, even stitches, especially  where any curved seams are to be stitched on the machine. This rule must  be followed invariably if puckering is to be avoided.      [Illustration: WAIST LINING BASTED, SEAMS OUT]      [Sidenote: Shoulder Seams]    The pattern at the shoulder seams should be shorter in front than at the  back. In joining this seam, pin the two portions so that the ends of the  seam meet exactly at the neck and arm's eye. In basting, stretch the  front piece to fit the back, holding it in or puckering it if need be.  Pressing will banish the pucker and give an easy seam that will hug the  curve of the shoulder, as in a man's coat.    [Sidenote: Fitting]    When the waist is on the figure, pull it well down to the waist line,  pin the front linings together beginning with the neck, then lift the  waist a little in front to give fullness and pin to the waist line. Mark  for the hem down the front, finish the edge with a well-fitted facing  under which is a thin bias strip of canvas interlining for buttons or  hooks and eyes. Marks showing the position of fastenings should be made  at this time.    [Sidenote: Fitting of Neck and Sleeves]    The neck and arm's eye should be fitted by making slashes in the  curve--never cut around the curve. For the collar or neck band have a  true bias of thin canvas or crinoline and draw it around the neck and  pin with the ends _out_, towards the worker. (Never lap any edges of  waist, belt or collar when fitting.) Mark on the waist where the lower  edge of the neck band touches. Draw the sleeve on the arm, pin and mark  where it sets right, seeing that the elbow fullness is in the right  place and that it does not twist at the hand.    As in the lining, all changes necessary in fitting should, if possible,  be made in the straight seams, as it is difficult to preserve the proper  lines of the curved ones. The shoulder seams should be the last one to  be basted.    After all faults are remedied, the seams are carefully stitched along  the line or basting, the bastings removed, the seams pressed and  finished. The last seam to be stitched securely should be the one at the  shoulder. By leaving this open, all fullness can be smoothed upwards and  any trimming can be let into the seam.      [Illustration: BACK OF WAIST, WELL MATCHED]      [Sidenote: Boning]    Sew in featherbone by cat stitching to the seam, first finishing the  ends by button-holing. All seams should be stretched well when sewing on  bones of any kind.    Curved seams should be notched every one or two inches at the curve and  bound or overcast. This allows them to lie flat.    [Sidenote: Draped Waist]    In a draped waist the lining is made separate and not stitched into any  seam of the outside except at the shoulder. In fitting the outside the  back is pinned on to the lining firmly, then the front and finally at  the underarm seams. The seams are then basted, the waist tried on again,  alterations made, if necessary, seams stitched and the bottom finished  with the lining, as desired.    Three eyes or other fastenings should always be sewed at the seams in  the waist line at the back to secure the skirt to the waist, thus  preventing it from sinking below the waist line.    [Sidenote: Finish of Bottom of Waist]    The finish of the lower edge of the waist is often a problem. If the  waist is to be worn under the skirt, just how to finish or whether to  finish it at all is a question. The first step is to trim the edges  evenly. A line of stitching and simple overcast will show less through a  close-fitting skirt of light weight material. When binding is used, it  should lie perfectly flat, twice stitched and pressed well.    If the waist is to be worn outside the skirt, a narrow bias strip of  canvas should be basted on the wrong side, the waist turned up over this  as directed for sleeve and collar finish. Over this a bias facing of  silk may be hemmed or cat-stitched.    [Sidenote: Fitting Irregularity of Figure]    In spite of careful measuring and all care in cutting, the waist may not  fit, owing to some deformity or peculiarity of the figure. Such figures  require especially careful fitting and the hollow place should be filled  out with wadding. This needs to be done with the greatest care and  nicety.      [Illustration: MAKING BIAS STRIPS FOR FACINGS]      Avoid too frequent fittings. The bias portions of the bodice are liable  to stretch out of shape and too much handling of the waist takes away  the freshness. This is one reason why it is advisable to make the  sleeves and collar first in order that the whole waist may be fitted at  once and all alterations made to fit both sides. A perfect figure is the  exception rather than the rule and the side that is not developed should  be well fitted, whether sleeve or bodice.      COAT OR TIGHT FITTING SLEEVES    [Sidenote: Altering Patterns]    If it is necessary to lengthen the sleeve, say two inches, cut the  pattern at right angles to the lines indicated by the dots, above and  below the elbow. The slashing should be done exactly at the same  distance apart in the upper and under portions of the sleeve in order to  retain the proper shape and size of the top and bottom. Separate the  parts, allowing one inch above and one inch below the elbow.    To shorten the sleeve, lap the slashed part or lay a fold in the pattern  instead of slashing. In either case, care should be taken that the fold  or lap is of even width all the way across, so that the original shape  of the sleeve will not be lost.    [Sidenote: Placing of Patterns]    Too much care cannot be taken in arranging the pattern of the sleeve  according to the thread of the goods. Especially is this the case in the  two-piece or coat sleeve. Generally the top part of the outside seam and  the lower part of the same side should be placed at the edge or fold of  the goods, so that the two run in the same straight line. In all cases,  the foundation sleeve or lining should be cut and fitted before the  outer portion is adjusted. Ample time should be given to the fitting and  basting of the sleeve. The \"set\" of the sleeve is very often  unsatisfactory because the cutting and original basting was done in a  careless manner. Remember that greater care is required in sleeve making  than in any part of the garment. Each sleeve is complete in itself and  one must not deviate from the other in size, arrangement or ornament,  or general appearance. They should be cut, basted and fitted alike and  if the arms differ in size or length the sleeves must be so adjusted as  to conceal the inequality.    The sleeves should be made at the same time and before the cuffs, then  the cuffs, puffs, or whatever special trimming is to be applied to them  should be put on both sleeves at the same time. If the second sleeve is  not made or trimmed until after the first is finished, it will be much  more difficult to secure exactly the same effect. If it is impossible to  complete both sleeves at one time, make the sleeves one day and the  cuffs or trimming the next day.    In making the coat sleeves the general methods are the same, but each  season brings out new styles which the maker will have to understand  before proper making and finishing can be acquired. Always master the  simple and standard patterns and the minor changes dictated by  fashion--new fancies and effects--will not be difficult to acquire after  a little experience has been gained.    The lining for both sleeves should be fitted and the outside cut by  them.    [Sidenote: Joining the Parts]    After economical cutting, trace the seams carefully, and baste the  outside to the lining, basting both uppers before the under sections.  Join the under and upper parts by pinning and basting, the outside seam  first, beginning in the middle of the sleeve and working toward each  end. The outside seams should be begun at the notch at the elbow,  working toward each end. Where the sleeve calls for gathering the  fullness should be distributed between the notches and the two portions  of the sleeve should be secured at this point, before or after basting  the upper or lower portions of each sleeve.      [Illustration: FINISHING OF SEAMS    Notched at Curves and Bound or Overcast.]      Stitch the seams just outside the basting, then remove the line of  basting along the seam and press. Trim off all rough edges. The inside  seam is opened and notched at the bend of the elbow and an inch or two  above and below and bound with silk binding ribbon or evenly overcast  with twist or mercerized cotton.    [Sidenote: Adding Cuffs]    If an elaborate cuff or trimming is to be added to the sleeve, whether  full or plain, it should be made separately and blind stitched to the  faced sleeve. In case the sleeve is gathered the fullness can be put  into a narrow band, the exact size of the cuff, the cuff then sewed on  the band.    [Sidenote: Putting in Sleeves]    In putting the sleeve in the armhole, be sure that both seams are at the  same point, that both have the same amount of fullness at the top, and  that the plaits or gathers are equally distributed from front to back.  The sleeve should be held next to the worker and should lie easy from  seam to seam at the under arm. Baste with close, even stitches or back  stitch with coarse cotton or twist the same color as the waist. Stitch  in the sleeves on this line of basting, keeping the armholes curved  while the stitching is being done. Trim off edges and finish with  binding or close overcasting. The most careful binding is clumsy  compared to the overcast finish. Turn the seam toward the shoulder and  hem to the lining over the shoulders. This will do away with the  stand-up look"]]]
