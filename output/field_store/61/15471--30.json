The style of the architecture would lead      to the same view; the octagonal pillars of the choir, with their      moulded caps, being most probably of the fourteenth century.\"[250]    The church, as restored and added to after 1387, is regarded as  consisting of a choir of four bays, with side aisles; a nave of five  bays, also with side aisles; a central crossing, north and south  transepts, and the five chapels just added south of the nave.[251] An  open porch, to the south of these chapels, was also erected along with  them, with a finely groined vault in the roof, and over it a small  chamber, lighted by a picturesque oriel window, supported on a corbel,  carved with an angel displaying the city arms.[252] The whole of the  main divisions of the structure were vaulted, and the massive octagonal  piers of the crossing were probably raised about this period.[253] The  vaulting of the crossing, with its central opening, was executed about  1400.[254] The ancient Norman porch, forming the north entrance to the  nave, was the only part of the twelfth century structure then preserved.  The restoration seems to have continued from 1385 to 1416.    Shortly after the erection of the five south chapels, another chapel,  called the Albany Aisle, was built on the north side of the nave to the  west of the old doorway. It opens from the nave with two arches, resting  on a central pillar, and the roof is covered with groined vaulting in  two bays.[255] On the pillar are sculptured the arms of the Duke of  Albany and also those of the Earl of Douglas. Their names are often  ominously found together in the history of the times, and both were  accused of the murder of the Duke of Rothesay, heir to the throne. They  were justly accused, and, although acquitted of the deed, the stain  continues to rest on their memory. The chapels were either built to  expiate their crime, or more probably to get a reputation for piety and  obtain the favour of the Church.[256]    Two other chapels were probably added to the north side of the nave  about the same period; they were on the east side of the Norman doorway,  and between it and the transept. One of them has disappeared, and the  eastern one was dedicated to St. Eloi. The vaulting of the north aisle  of the nave was necessarily rebuilt at the time when the north chapels  were erected.[257]    About fifty years later, great extensions and improvements were carried  out under the auspices of Queen Mary of Gueldres, by whom Trinity  College Church was also founded in 1462. The Town Council and merchants  of Edinburgh also endowed it. The extensions of St. Giles consisted of  (1) the lengthening of the choir by one bay; (2) the heightening of the  central aisle of the choir and vaulting it anew, together with the  introduction of a new clerestory; and (3) the lengthening of the  transepts.[258] The church is thus the work of many generations, and is  the outcome of public and private contributions. That the choir was  enlarged at this period is chiefly made evident by the heraldic devices  and armorial bearings still existing. While the pillars nearest to the  centre are plain octagons, with arches corresponding in simplicity,  those at the east end have decorated capitals, supporting moulded  arches. The King's pillar, as it is called, is the first from the window  on the north side, and is near the spot where stood the High Altar. On  the foliated capital are four coats of arms, and the first has the lion  within the double tressure, and the armorial bearings are usually  supposed to be those of King James II. (1436-1460); the second, impaled,  of his Queen, Mary of Gueldres (1449-1463); the third has also the lion  within the double tressure and a label of three points, which is held to  denote a prince or heir, if not a younger son. The fourth shield has  three _fleurs-de-lys_ for France.[259] These shields clearly connect the  pillar with Mary of Gueldres, and her husband, James II., and their son,  James III., who was born in 1453. The work was probably executed between  1453 and 1463.[260] On the opposite pillar, on the south side of the  high altar, are also four coats of arms, viz. those of the town of  Edinburgh and of the families of Kennedy, Otterburn, and Preston. To  commemorate other benefactors, on the demi-pillar, on the north side of  the eastern window, we have the arms (three cranes _gorged_) of Thomas  Cranstoun, chief magistrate of Edinburgh in 1439 and 1454; on the south  side, those of Napier of Merchiston, Provost of Edinburgh in 1457--a  saltier engrailed, cantoned with four rosettes.[261] (2) The heightening  of the choir and the introduction of a new clerestory were also carried  out shortly after the middle of the fifteenth century, the height of the  former choir being shown by the vault of the crossing, which it  doubtless resembled, and which was not altered at that time. The outline  of the old roof may also be observed against the east and west walls of  the tower--the raglet and a stepped string-course above it being yet  preserved, and being specially visible on the east side next the choir.  The beauty of the vaulting of the central choir aisle is noticeable when  contrasted with that of the side aisles.[262] The central crossing, with  its vault, was left unaltered, and still remains in the same position,  with its vaulting at the level it was raised to about 1400. It forms a  break between the nave and the choir, in both of which the vault has  been raised.[263] (3) The transepts were extended, their original length  being marked by breaks in the roof, where the vaulting terminates.    In a charter dated 11th January 1454-1455,[264] it is narrated that  William Preston of Gourtoun, after much trouble and expense abroad, and  aided by \"a high and mighty prince, the King of France, and many other  Lords of France,\" had succeeded in obtaining an arm bone of the patron  saint, which he generously bequeathed to the church. The Town Council  were so gratified with the gift that they resolved to add an aisle to  the choir in commemoration of the event, and to place therein a tablet  of brass recording the bounty of the donor. This aisle was to be built  within six or seven years \"furth frae our Lady isle, quhair the said  William lyis.\" It thus appears that the south aisle of the nave was  known as the lady chapel, and that Sir William was buried there. The  resolution was carried into effect, and a new aisle called the Preston  Aisle was constructed, south of the lady chapel. The Preston Aisle was  afterwards known as the Assembly Aisle. In carrying out the work the  south wall opposite the three westmost bays of the choir was removed,  and three arches carried on two piers substituted. These piers and  arches correspond with the work of the same period at the east end of  the choir. One of the caps contains a shield bearing the three unicorns'  heads of the Prestons. The structure extends into the choir the great  width of the four aisles of the church previously formed in the nave,  and adds greatly both to spaciousness and grandeur. The church was now  complete in all its parts, as, internally, it still remains, with a few  exceptions, to the present day.[265]    Several additional chapels were afterwards thrown out. In 1513 an aisle  of two arches was formed by Alexander Lauder of Blyth, Provost of the  city; in 1518 the altar of the Holy Blood was erected in this aisle,  which lay on the south of the nave, and to the east of the south porch,  immediately adjoining the south transept. It opened into the south  chapels of the nave with two arches, and had two windows to the south.  There was within it a handsome monument containing a recumbent statue,  or forming, as some suppose, part of the altar canopy. The monument is  still preserved, but one half of the chapel was obliterated in 1829.    In 1466 the parish church of St. Giles was erected by charter of James  III. into a collegiate establishment, but it is not called collegiate  till 1475. The chapter consisted of a provost or dean, sixteen  prebendaries, a master of the choir, four choristers, a sacristan, and a  beadle with chaplains. The revenues of the altars and chaplainries in  the church were appropriated for the support of the several officers in  the new establishment. The King reserved the nomination of the dean or  provost, who enjoyed the tithes and other revenues of St. Giles' Church,  with the adjacent manse; the provost had the right of choosing a curate,  who had a yearly allowance of 25 marks with a house adjoining.[266] In  subsequent charters the church is called the College Kirk of St. Geill  of Edinburgh.    About this period a few additions were made. A small chapel, called the  Chapman Aisle, was thrown out from the Preston Aisle close to the south  transept. It was dedicated to St. John the Evangelist by Walter Chapman,  called the Scottish Caxton, from his having introduced into Scotland in  1507 the art of printing. The chapel was dedicated within a month of  King James' death at Flodden. The south transept seems to have been  extended southward during the erection. The chapel to the east of the  north transept contained several storeys and a staircase. It is said to  have been erected after the Reformation. Used as the Town Clerk's  office, and later as a vestry, it has been recently set apart to contain  the monument of Dr. William Chambers, by whose liberality the cathedral  has been recently restored.    In 1829 the church was entirely renewed as regards the exterior, and two  chapels to the south of those built in 1389 and the south porch were  removed. The round arched doorway of the south porch was again erected  between the north pillars of the crossing as the entrance to the central  division of the church. It has now been transferred to the entrance  doorway to the royal pew at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],[0,"The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#20)"],[1,"Bagnio, and tended to cheer at least  two of the slaves.    This ray was conveyed by means of the Padre Giovanni, whom we have  elsewhere mentioned as being the friend and benefactor of the slaves.    Previous to his visit a cloud had overshadowed the prison.  Several  chaouses had entered, and, after loading Castello and the other runaways  with chains, had led them forth to death.  It would be painful as well  as unnecessary to detail the terrible tortures under which these  wretched men perished.  The remaining slaves knew well the nature of the  fate that awaited them, and the blank caused by the disappearance for  ever of their well-known faces, was fitted to restrain all thoughts of  rebellion, had such existed.  Some surprise was felt at first by all the  slaves at the delay of punishment in the case of Francisco and Mariano,  but after the first hour or two had passed, they ceased to give the  matter a thought.    When, therefore, the old man Giovanni entered the Bagnio and informed  these two that the Dey had reprieved them, and commanded their  attendance at the palace, their surprise was re-awakened, and  speculation as to the cause of such unusual proceedings was revived.    \"I am the bearer of still further tidings,\" said the old man, taking a  letter from a sort of wallet that hung from his shoulder, and handing it  to Francisco.    \"From Juliet!\" exclaimed Francisco, tearing it open and reading aloud  eagerly:--      \"`Dearest Father,--It is not possible to express to you the agony that    we endured on hearing that you had been taken captive by the    Algerines.  Oh, why are such monsters allowed to live?  (\"Why,    indeed!\" interjected Francisco, bitterly.)  But take comfort.  God    watches over us all.  Some of your old friends here have begun to    collect money for your ransom, and I work hard to increase the sum--    but oh! how slowly it grows!  Even darling grandmamma has got some    light sewing work which brings in a little.  But our hearts mourn    because of you.  We earnestly hope that the pirates treat you well,    (\"Thank God they do not know anything about _that_,\" muttered    Francisco), and we feel almost sure that they do, because we have been    told that they are careful of the slaves who, they hope, will be    ransomed.  I have therefore written to the Dey--how I hated him while    I wrote the humble letter!--telling him that we hoped to raise the sum    in a short time.  Every one here is very kind and sympathises with us,    besides giving a contribution to the fund.      \"`This letter goes by a French vessel which is to touch at Algiers,    and which conveys a priest who has a large sum of money with him to    ransom Sicilian and other slaves.  I entreated him to ransom you with    part of it, but he smiled pitifully, and said the money had been    raised by the friends of particular slaves, some of whom had been many    years in captivity, and that it could not be diverted from its proper    objects.  How my heart sank when he spoke of some being in slavery for    many years!  But it was cheered again when I reflected how hard we are    all working to raise the money for you and Lucien and Mariano.  We    send you all our dear love.--Your affectionate daughter.    \"Shall I have an opportunity of answering this?\" asked Francisco,  eagerly.    \"Yes; I am about to conduct you to the palace, where your son Lucien--  who, I may mention, is a favourite--awaits you.\"    \"You mustn't let them know the truth, father,\" said Mariano earnestly.    \"Would you have him tell them what is false?\" asked the Padre gravely.    \"No, no,\" replied the youth, with a laugh, \"but there is no occasion to  mention all that we have suffered, you know; and there is a good deal--I  mean a little--that is agreeable to communicate.  For instance, this  very summons to the palace, and Lucien's good luck.\"    \"Trust me, lad,\" said Francisco; \"I won't fail to cheer them if I can,  and you may be sure I won't exaggerate our misfortunes.--But lead on,  old man; I am anxious to get out of this foul den as quickly as--\"    \"Forgive me, comrades,\" he added, checking himself, and turning to the  slaves near him; \"I am grieved more than I can tell to leave you behind.  If by remaining I could lighten your sorrows, I would gladly do so.  It  may seem presumptuous in one who is himself a slave to say so, yet I  can't help assuring you that if the Almighty is pleased to give me any  power in this city, I won't forget you.\"    This speech was received with a kindly nod by some, and a laugh of scorn  by others.    Probably the latter had heard similar sentiments before from somewhat  kindred and hearty spirits, and had learned from sad experience that  nothing ever came of their good-will.    Following the old man, the father and son were soon in the presence of  Lucien, who received them, as may well be believed, with a full heart.    \"God bless you, my son,\" said Francisco, \"for well assured am I that it  is through your influence that we are here.\"    \"It is through the influence of the British consul,\" replied Lucien.    \"Well, I pray for a blessing on you both, for it is useless to tell me  that _you_ have had no hand in it.\"    \"I do not say that I had no hand in it.  On the contrary, I wrote out  the order for your acquittal; and,\" added Lucien, with a peculiar smile,  \"I also had previously written out your and Mariano's death-warrant!\"    \"You are jesting, lad,\" said Francisco.    \"Indeed, I am not,\" returned Lucien, relating the circumstances of the  whole matter to his astonished and somewhat horrified auditors.    \"And now,\" he continued, \"I must let you know your destination.  Don't  be disappointed.  You must remember that we are slaves, and have just  been delivered from the Bagnio.  The Dey seems to have taken a fancy for  me--\"    \"I don't wonder,\" interrupted Mariano enthusiastically, seizing and  squeezing his brother's hand.    \"And,\" continued Lucien, \"he has permitted me to select situations for  you.  I have arranged that you, father, shall be my assistant in the  secretary's office, and that you, Mariano, shall be shopman to Bacri the  Jew.\"    Lucien looked awkwardly at his father and brother as he spoke, feeling  uncertain, no doubt, as to the manner in which they would receive this  information.  He was therefore rather relieved than otherwise by a smile  on the face of Mariano.    \"Why, Lucien,\" he said, \"I always thought you a great original, and this  last display of your powers confirms me in my opinion.  Not that I deem  it strange your having appointed father your clerk--for, in the  circumstances, it would have been charity to have appointed him even to  the office of shoe-black--anything being better than the Bagnio,--but  what wild fancy induced you to make _me_ shop-boy to a Jew?\"    \"That,\" replied Lucien, \"you shall find out in good time--only, pray,  remember that I am not the Dey's Grand Vizier, and have not many places  to offer.\"    \"Well, well, be it so,\" returned the other; \"I am well content with what  your wisdom provides.\"    \"And so am I,\" said Francisco, cheerfully.  \"I suppose you will feed us  better than we have been fed of late?\"    \"That will I, father, but there is no pay attached to your offices, for  slaves, you know, get no wages.\"    \"They get splendid habiliments, it would seem,\" observed Francisco,  regarding his son with twinkling eyes.  \"But come, Lucien, I am all  impatience to begin the work of under-secretary of state!  You bear in  remembrance, I trust, that I can read and write nothing save my mother  tongue?\"    \"Yes; Italian will suffice, father; such of the duties as you fail to  perform I can easily fulfil.--Now, Mariano,\" he said, taking his brother  aside, and speaking in a low earnest tone, \"see that you act wisely in  the situation I have selected for you.  The Jew is a kind, good man,  despite what is said about his worship of Mammon.  I would that all in  this city were like him, for in that case we should have no slavery.  During the short period I have held my office, my eyes have been opened  to much that I may not mention.  There, the very walls of this palace  have ears!  I have said enough.  You remember Angela?\"    \"Remember her!\" exclaimed Mariano, with a deep flush and a look of  intense surprise, \"how can you ask me, Lucien?\"    \"Well, you will hear of her from Bacri.  Good bye--go!\"    He rang a bell as he spoke, and ordered the slave who answered the  summons to lead Mariano to the abode of Bacri; at the same time he took  his father's hand and conducted him to his office or bureau.    Amazed at all that had happened, particularly at his summary dismissal  by his brother, the youth followed his conductor in silence, and in a  short time reached the iron-bolted door of the chief of the Jews.    \"This is Bacri's house,\" said his guide in Italian, and, having  discharged this duty, he turned on his heel, and abruptly left him.    Pausing a moment to think, and finding that the more he thought the less  he seemed to be capable of thinking to any purpose, Mariano applied his  knuckles to the door.    For a youth of his character it was a timid knock, and produced no  result.    Mariano was one who--in peculiar circumstances, like those in which at  that time he found himself--might once in a way act with timidity, but  he was not the man to act so twice.  Finding that the first knock was  useless, he hit the door a blow that caused the old house to resound.  In a few seconds it was opened slightly, and the face of a beautiful  girl in Jewish costume appeared.    If Mariano had been suddenly petrified he could not have stood more  rigidly motionless; amazement sat enthroned on his countenance.    \"Angela!\"    \"Signor Mariano!\"    The words in each case were followed by a deep flush, and Angela  retreated.    Of course Mariano advanced.    \"Excuse--forgive me, signorina,\" he exclaimed, taking her hand  respectfully.  \"I did"]]]
