The alkaline silicate of soda (140 deg. Tw.,  59.5 deg. B.) is the quality most convenient for yellow soaps; this may be  diluted to the desired gravity by boiling with water. For a reduction of  3-4 per cent. fatty acids content, a solution of 6 deg. Tw. (4 deg. B.)  (boiling) is most suitable, and if the reduction desired is greater, the  density of the silicate solution should be increased; for example, to  effect a reduction of 20 per cent. fatty acids content, a solution of  18 deg. Tw. (12 deg. B.) (boiling) would probably be found to answer.    In some instances 140 deg. Tw. (59.5 deg. B.) silicate may be added; experiment  alone will demonstrate the amount which can be satisfactorily  incorporated without the soap becoming \"open,\" but 1/10 of the quantity  of soap taken is practically a limit, and it will be found that the  temperature should be low; the same quantity of silicate at different  temperatures does not produce the same result. Various other strengths  of sodium silicate are employed, depending upon the composition and body  of the soap base--neutral silicate 75 deg. Tw. (39.4 deg. B.) also finds favour  with some soap-makers. Mixtures of soda crystals or soda ash solution  with silicate of soda solution are used for a certain grade of soap,  which is crutched until smooth and stiff. Glauber's salt (sodium  sulphate) produces a good smooth surface when added to soap, but, owing  to its tendency to effloresce more quickly than soda carbonate, it is  not so much used as formerly.    Common salt sometimes forms an ingredient in liquoring mixtures.  Potassium chloride and potassium silicate find a limited use for  intermixing with soft soaps.    It will be readily understood that hard and fast rules cannot be laid  down for \"liquoring\" soap, and the correct solution to be employed can  only be ascertained by experiment and experience, but the above  suggestions will prove useful as a guide towards good results. A smooth,  firm soap of clear, bright, glossy appearance is what should be aimed  at.    _Filling._--Some low-grade soaps contain filling, which serves no useful  purpose beyond the addition of weight. Talc is the most frequently used  article of this description. It consists of hydrated silicate of  magnesium and, when finely ground, is white and greasy to the touch. The  addition of this substance to the hot soap is made by suspending it in  silicate of soda solution.    Whatever filling material is used, it is important that the appearance  of the soap should not be materially altered.    _Neutralising, Colouring and Perfuming._--The free caustic alkali in  soap, intended for toilet or laundry purposes, is usually neutralised  during the cleansing, although some soap manufacturers prefer to  accomplish this during the milling operation. Various materials have  been recommended for the purpose, those in most general use being sodium  bicarbonate, boric acid, cocoa-nut oil, stearic acid, and oleic acid.    The best method is the addition of an exact quantity of sodium  bicarbonate (acid sodium carbonate), which converts the caustic alkali  into carbonate. The reaction may be expressed by the equation:--              NaOH  +      NaHCO_{3}     =   Na_{2}CO_{3}    + H_{2}O      Caustic soda  Bicarbonate of soda  Carbonate of soda    Water    Boric acid in aqueous or glycerine solutions, and borax (biborate of  soda) are sometimes used, but care is necessary in employing these  substances, as any excess is liable to decompose the soap.    The addition of cocoa-nut oil is unsatisfactory, the great objection  being that complete saponification is difficult to ensure, and, further,  there is always the liability of rancidity developing. Stearic and oleic  acids are more suitable for the purpose, but oleic acid has the  disadvantage that oleates are very liable to go rancid.    A large number of other substances have been proposed, and in many  instances patented, for neutralising the free caustic alkali. Among  these may be mentioned--Alder Wright's method of using an ammoniacal  salt, the acid radicle of which neutralises the caustic alkali, ammonia  being liberated; the use of sodium and potassium bibasic phosphate (Eng.  Pat. 25,357, 1899); a substance formed by treating albumen with formalin  (Eng. Pat., 8,582, 1900); wheat glutenin \"albuminoses\" (albumen after  acid or alkaline treatment); malt extract; and egg, milk, or vegetable  albumen.    The colouring matter used may be of either vegetable or coal-tar origin,  and is dissolved in the most suitable medium (lye, water, or fat). The  older types of colouring matter--such as cadmium yellow, ochres,  vermilion, umbers--have been superseded.    In the production of washer household soaps, a small quantity of perfume  is sometimes added.    _Disinfectant Soaps._--To the soap base, which must be strong to taste,  is added from 3 to 4 per cent. of coal-tar derivatives, such as carbolic  acid, cresylic acid, creosote, naphthalene, or compounds containing  carbolic acid and its homologues. The incorporation is made in the  crutching pan, and further crutching may be given by hand in the frames.    _Framing._--The object of framing is to allow the soap to solidify into  blocks. The frames intended for mottled soaps, which require slow  cooling, are constructed of wood, often with a well in the base to allow  excess of lye to accumulate--for other soaps, iron frames are in general  use. The frame manufactured by H. D. Morgan of Liverpool is shown in  Fig. 9.    As soon as the frame is filled, or as soon as the crutching in the frame  is finished, the soap is smoothed by means of a trowel, leaving in the  centre a heap which slopes towards the sides. Next day the top of the  soap is straightened or flattened with a wooden mallet, this treatment  assisting in the consolidation.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Soap frame.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Slabbing machine.]    The length of time the soap should remain in frames is dependent on the  quality, quantity, and season or temperature, and varies usually from  three to seven days. When the requisite period has elapsed, the sides  and ends of the frames are removed, and there remains a solid block of  soap weighing from 10 to 15 cwt. according to the size of frame used.  The blocks, after scraping and trimming, are ready for cutting into  slabs.    _Slabbing._--This may be done mechanically by pushing the block of soap  through a framework containing pianoforte wires fixed at equi-distances  (Fig. 10, which shows a machine designed by E. Forshaw & Son, Ltd.), or  the soap may be out by hand by pulling a looped wire through the mass  horizontally along lines previously scribed, or, for a standard sized  slab, the wire may be a fixture in a box-like arrangement, which is  passed along the top of the soap, and the distance of the wire from the  top of the box will be the thickness of the slab (Fig. 11).    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Banjo slabber.]    All tallow soaps should be slabbed whilst still warm, cut into bars, and  open-piled immediately; if this type of soap is cold when slabbed its  appearance will be very much altered.    _Barring._--The slabs are out transversely into bars by means of the  looped wire, or more usually by a machine (Fig. 12), the lower framework  of which, containing wires, is drawn through the soap placed on the  base-board; the framework is raised, and the bars fall upon the shelf,  ready for transference into piles. It has long been the custom in  England to cut bars of soap 15 inches long, and weighing 3 lb. each, or  37-1/2 bars of soap to the cwt., but in recent years a demand has arisen  for bars of so many various weights that it must be sometimes a  difficult matter to know what sizes to stock.    In another type of barring machine, portions of the slab, previously cut  to size, are pushed against a framework carrying wires, and the bars  slide along a table ready for handling (Fig. 13).    In cutting machines, through which \"washer\" household soap is being  passed, the bar is pushed at right angles through another frame  containing wires, which divides it into tablets; these may be received  upon racks and are ready for drying and stamping. It is needless to say  that the slabs and tablets are cut with a view to reducing the amount of  waste to the lowest possible limit. Such a machine, made by E. Forshaw &  Son, Ltd., is shown in Fig. 14.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Barring machine.]    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Bar-cutting machine.]    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Tablet-cutting machine.]    _Open- and Close-piling._--As remarked previously, tallow soaps should  be cut whilst warm, and the bars \"open-piled,\" or stacked across each  other in such a way that air has free access to each bar for a day. The  bar of soap will skin or case-harden, and next day may be \"close-piled,\"  or placed in the storage bins, where they should remain for two or three  weeks, when they will be in perfect condition for packing into boxes  ready for distribution.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Soap stamp.]    _Drying._--\"Oil soaps,\" as soaps of the washer type are termed, do not  skin sufficiently by the open-piling treatment, and are generally  exposed on racks to a current of hot air in a drying chamber in order to  produce the skin, which prevents evaporation of water, and allows of an  impression being given by the stamp without the soap adhering to the  dies. It is of course understood that heavily liquored soaps are, as a  rule, unsuitable for the drying treatment, as the bars become unshapely,  and lose water rapidly.    _Stamping._--Bar soaps are usually stamped by means of a hand-stamp  containing removable or fixed brass letters (Fig. 15), with a certain  brand or designation of quality and the name of the manufacturer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],[0,"The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#20)"],[1,"an arrow.  At the same instant Mahtawa, descending from his tree,  ran as fast as he could towards the village, uttering the terrible  war-whoop when near enough to be heard.  No sound sends such a thrill  through an Indian camp.  Every warrior flew to arms, and vaulted on his  steed.  So quickly was the alarm given that in less than ten minutes a  thousand hoofs were thundering on the plain, and faintly reached the  ears of the fugitives.    Joe smiled.  \"It'll puzzle them to come up wi' nags like ours.  They're  in prime condition too, lots o' wind in 'em.  If we only keep out o'  badger holes we may laugh at the red varmints.\"    Joe's opinion of Indian horses was correct.  In a very few minutes the  sound of hoofs died away, but the fugitives did not draw bridle during  the remainder of that night, for they knew not how long the pursuit  might be continued.  By pond, and brook, and bluff they passed, down in  the grassy bottoms and over the prairie waves,--nor checked their  headlong course till the sun blazed over the level sweep of the eastern  plain as if it arose out of the mighty ocean.    Then they sprang from the saddle and hastily set about the preparation  of their morning meal.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    EVENING MEDITATIONS AND MORNING REFLECTIONS--BUFFALOES, BADGERS,  ANTELOPES, AND ACCIDENTS--AN OLD BULL AND THE WOLVES--\"MAD-TAILS\"--HENRI  FLOORED, ETCETERA.    There is nothing that prepares one so well for the enjoyment of rest,  both mental and physical, as a long-protracted period of excitement and  anxiety, followed up by bodily fatigue.  Excitement alone banishes rest;  but, united with severe physical exertion, it prepares for it.  At  least, courteous reader, this is our experience, and certainly this was  the experience of our three hunters as they lay on their backs beneath  the branches of a willow bush, and gazed serenely up at the twinkling  stars, two days after their escape from the Indian village.    They spoke little; they were too tired for that; also, they were too  comfortable.  Their respective suppers of fresh antelope steak, shot  that day, had just been disposed of; their feet were directed towards  the small fire on which the said steaks had been cooked, and which still  threw a warm, ruddy glow over the encampment.  Their blankets were  wrapped comfortably round them, and tucked in as only hunters and  mothers know _how_ to tuck them in.  Their respective pipes delivered  forth, at stated intervals, three richly yellow puffs of smoke, as if a  three-gun battery were playing upon the sky from that particular spot of  earth.  The horses were picketted and hobbled in a rich grassy bottom  close by, from which the quiet munch of their equine jaws sounded  pleasantly, for it told of healthy appetites, and promised speed on the  morrow.  The fear of being overtaken during the night was now past, and  the faithful Crusoe, by virtue of sight, hearing, and smell, guaranteed  them against sudden attack during the hours of slumber.  A perfume of  wild flowers mingled with the loved odours of the \"weed,\" and the tinkle  of a tiny rivulet fell sweetly on their ears.  In short, the  \"Pale-faces\" were supremely happy, and disposed to be thankful for their  recent deliverance and their present comforts.    \"I wonder what the stars are,\" said Dick, languidly taking the pipe out  of his mouth.    \"Bits o' fire,\" suggested Joe.    \"I tink dey are vorlds,\" muttered Henri, \"an' have peepels in dem.  I  have hear men say dat.\"    A long silence followed, during which, no doubt, the star-gazers were  working out various theories in their own minds.    \"Wonder,\" said Dick again, \"how far off they be.\"    \"A mile or two, maybe,\" said Joe.    Henri was about to laugh sarcastically at this; but, on further  consideration, he thought it would be more comfortable not to, so he lay  still.  In another minute he said--\"Joe Blunt, you is ver' igrant.  Don't you know dat de books say de stars be hondreds, tousands,--oh!  milleryons of mile away to here, and dat de is more bigger dan dis  vorld?\"    Joe snored lightly, and his pipe fell out of his mouth at this point, so  the conversation dropped.  Presently Dick asked, in a low tone, \"I say,  Henri, are ye asleep?\"    \"Oui,\" replied Henri, faintly.  \"Don't speak, or you vill vaken me.\"    \"Ah!  Crusoe, you're not asleep, are you, pup?\"  No need to ask that  question.  The instantaneous wag of that speaking fail, and the glance  of that wakeful eye, as the dog lifted his head and laid his chin on  Dick's arm, showed that he had been listening to every word that was  spoken.  We cannot say whether he understood it, but beyond all doubt he  heard it.  Crusoe never presumed to think of going to sleep until his  master was as sound as a top; then he ventured to indulge in that light  species of slumber which is familiarly known as \"sleeping with one eye  open.\"  But, comparatively, as well as figuratively speaking, Crusoe  slept usually with one eye and a-half open, and the other half was never  very tightly shut.    Gradually Dick's pipe fell out of his mouth, an event which the dog,  with an exercise of instinct almost, if not quite, amounting to reason,  regarded as a signal for him to go off.  The campfire went slowly out,  the stars twinkled down at their reflections in the brook, and a deep  breathing of wearied men was the only sound that rose in harmony with  the purling stream.    Before the sun rose next morning, and while many of the brighter stars  were still struggling for existence with the approaching day, Joe was up  and buckling on the saddle-bags, while he shouted to his unwilling  companions to rise.    \"If it depended on you,\" he said, \"the Pawnees wouldn't be long afore  they got our scalps.  Jump, ye dogs, an' lend a hand, will ye!\"    A snore from Dick and a deep sigh from Henri was the answer to this  pathetic appeal.  It so happened, however, that Henri's pipe, in falling  from his lips, had emptied the ashes just under his nose, so that the  sigh referred to drew a quantity thereof into his throat, and almost  choked him.  Nothing could have been a more effective awakener.  He was  up in a moment coughing vociferously.  Most men have a tendency to vent  ill-humour on some one, and they generally do it on one whom they deem  to be worse than themselves.  Henri, therefore, instead of growling at  Joe for rousing him, scolded Dick for not rising.    \"Ha, mauvais dog! bad chien, vill you dare to look to me?\"    Crusoe did look with amiable placidity, as though to say, \"Howl away,  old boy, I won't budge till Dick does.\"    With a mighty effort Giant Sleep was thrown off at last, and the hunters  were once more on their journey, cantering lightly over the soft turf.    \"Ho! let's have a run,\" cried Dick, unable to repress the feelings  aroused by the exhilarating morning air.    \"Have a care, boy,\" cried Joe, as they stretched out at full gallop.  \"Keep off the ridge; it's riddled wi' badger--Hah!  I thought so.\"    At that moment Dick's horse put its foot into a badger hole, and turned  completely over, sending its rider through the air in a curve that an  East Indian acrobat would have envied.  For a few seconds Dick lay flat  on his back; then he jumped up and laughed, while his comrades hurried  up anxiously to his assistance.    \"No bones broke?\" inquired Joe.    Dick gave a hysterical gasp.  \"I--I think not.\"    \"Let's have a look.  No, nothin' to speak o', be good luck.  Ye should  niver go slap through a badger country like that, boy; always keep i'  the bottoms, where the grass is short.  Now then, up ye go.  That's it!\"    Dick remounted, though not with quite so elastic a spring as usual, and  they pushed forward at a more reasonable pace.    Accidents of this kind are of common occurrence in the prairies.  Some  horses, however, are so well trained that they look sharp out for these  holes, which are generally found to be most numerous on the high and dry  grounds.  But in spite of all the caution both of man and horse, many  ugly falls take place, and sometimes bones are broken.    They had not gone far after this accident, when an antelope leaped from  a clump of willows and made for a belt of woodland that lay along the  margin of a stream not half a mile off.    \"Hurrah!\" cried Dick, forgetting his recent fall.  \"Come along, Crusoe.\"  And away they went again full tilt, for the horse had not been injured  by its somersault.    The antelope which Dick was thus wildly pursuing was of the same species  as the one he had shot some time before, namely, the prong-horned  antelope.  These graceful creatures have long, slender limbs, delicately  formed heads, and large, beautiful eyes.  The horns are black, and  rather short; they have no branches like the antlers of the red-deer,  but have a single projection on each horn, near the head, and the  extreme points of the horns curve suddenly inwards, forming the hook or  prong from which the name of the animal is derived.  Their colour is  dark yellowish brown.  They are so fleet that not one horse in a hundred  can overtake them, and their sight and sense of smell are so acute, that  it would be next to impossible to kill them, were it not for the  inordinate curiosity which we have before referred to.  The Indians  manage to attract these simple little creatures by merely lying down on  their backs and kicking their heels in the air, or by waving any white  object on the point of an arrow, while the hunter keeps concealed by  lying flat in the grass.  By these means a herd of antelopes may be  induced to wheel round and round an object in timid, but intense,  surprise, gradually approaching until they come near enough to enable  the hunter to make sure of his mark.  Thus the animals, which of all  others _ought_ to be the most difficult to slay, are, in consequence of  their insatiable curiosity, more easily shot than any other deer of the  plains.
