After he had, with great trouble,  got the consent of the Lady Cassandra, and made her a promise to stay  away only two years, he made all things ready for his journey; and  taking his lady into one of his private rooms, he showed her three  chests of gold. He told her to keep one of these for herself, and take  charge of the other two for their sons, in case any evil should happen  to him. He then led her back to the room where the whole family were  sitting, embraced them all tenderly one by one, and set sail with a  fair wind for Alexandria.    When Fortunatus came to this place, he was told it was the custom to  make a handsome present to the sultan; so he sent him a piece of plate  that cost five thousand pounds. The sultan was so much pleased with  this, that he ordered a hundred casks of spices to be given to  Fortunatus in return. Fortunatus sent these straight to the Lady  Cassandra, with the most tender letters, by the same ship that brought  him, which was then going back to Famagosta. Having stated that he  wished to travel through his country by land, he obtained from the  sultan such passports and letters as he might stand in need of, to the  other princes in those parts. He then bought a camel, hired proper  servants, and set off on his travels. He went through Turkey, Persia,  and from thence to Carthage; he next went into the country of Prester  John, who rides upon a white elephant, and has kings to wait on him.  Fortunatus made him some rich presents, and went on to Calcutta; and,  in coming back, he took Jerusalem in the way, and so came again to  Alexandria, where he had the good fortune to find the same ship that  had brought him, and to learn from the captain that his wife and  family were all in perfect health. The first thing he did was to pay a  visit to his old friend the sultan, to whom he again made a handsome  present, and was invited to dine at his palace. After dinner, the  sultan said: \"It must be vastly amusing, Fortunatus, to hear an  account of all the places you have seen; pray favour me with a history  of your travels.\" Fortunatus did as he was desired, and pleased the  sultan very much by telling him the many odd adventures he had met  with; and, above all, the manner of his first becoming known to the  Lord Loch-Fitty, and the desire of that lord to maintain the honours  of his family. When he had ended, the sultan said he was greatly  pleased with what he had heard, but that he possessed a more curious  thing than any Fortunatus had told him of. He then led him into a room  almost filled with jewels, opened a large closet, and took out a cap,  which he said was of greater value than all the rest. Fortunatus  thought the sultan was joking, and told him he had seen many a better  cap than that. \"Ah!\" said the sultan, \"that is because you do not know  its value. Whoever puts this cap on his head, and wishes to be in any  part of the world, will find himself there in a moment.\"    \"Indeed!\" said Fortunatus; \"and pray, is the man living who made it?\"    \"I know nothing about that,\" said the sultan.    \"One would hardly believe it,\" said Fortunatus. \"Pray, sir, is it very  heavy?\"    \"Not at all,\" replied the sultan; \"you may feel it.\"    Fortunatus took up the cap, put it on his head, and could not help  wishing himself on board the ship that was going back to Famagosta. In  less than a moment he was carried on board of her, just as she was  ready to sail; and there being a brisk gale, they were out of sight in  half an hour, before the sultan had even time to repent of his folly  for letting Fortunatus try the cap on his head. The ship came safe to  Famagosta, after a happy passage, and Fortunatus found his wife and  children well; but Lord Loch-Fitty and his lady had died of old age,  and were buried in the same grave.    Fortunatus now began to take great pleasure in teaching his two boys  all sorts of useful learning, and also such manly sports as wrestling  and tilting. Now and then he thought about the curious cap which had  brought him home, and then would wish he could just take a peep at  what was passing in other countries; which wish was always fulfilled:  but he never stayed there more than an hour or two, so that the Lady  Cassandra did not miss him, and was no longer made uneasy by his love  of travelling.    At last, Fortunatus began to grow old, and the Lady Cassandra fell  sick and died. The loss of her caused him so much grief, that soon  after he fell sick too. As he thought he had not long to live, he  called his two sons to his bedside, and told them the secrets of the  purse and the cap, which he begged they would not, on any account,  make known to others. \"Follow my example,\" said he: \"I have had the  purse these forty years, and no living person knew from what source I  obtained my riches.\" He then told them to make use of the purse  between them, and to live together in friendship; and embracing them,  died soon after. Fortunatus was buried with great pomp by the side of  Lady Cassandra, in his own chapel, and was for a long time mourned by  the people of Famagosta.          THE BREMEN TOWN MUSICIANS.      There was a man who owned a donkey, which had carried his sacks to the  mill industriously for many years, but whose strength had come to an  end, so that the poor beast grew more and more unfit for work. The  master determined to stop his food, but the donkey, discovering that  there was no good intended to him, ran away and took the road to  Bremen: \"There,\" thought he, \"I can turn Town Musician.\"    When he had gone a little way, he found a hound lying on the road and  panting, like one who was tired with running. \"Hollo! what are you  panting so for, worthy Seize 'em?\" asked the donkey.    \"Oh!\" said the dog, \"just because I am old, and get weaker every day,  and cannot go out hunting, my master wanted to kill me, so I have  taken leave of him; but how shall I gain my living now?\"    \"I'll tell you what,\" said the donkey, \"I am going to Bremen to be  Town Musician; come with me and take to music too. I will play the  lute, and you shall beat the drum.\"    The dog liked the idea, and they travelled on. It was not long before  they saw a cat sitting by the road, making a face like three rainy  days.    \"Now then, what has gone wrong with you old Whiskers?\" said the  donkey.    \"Who can be merry when his neck is in danger?\" answered the cat.  \"Because I am advanced in years, and my teeth are blunt, and I like  sitting before the fire and purring better than chasing the mice  about, my mistress wanted to drown me. I have managed to escape, but  good advice is scarce; tell me where I shall go to?\"    \"Come with us two to Bremen; you understand serenading; you also can  become a Town Musician.\"    The cat thought it a capital idea, and went with them. Soon after the  three runaways came to a farmyard, and there sat a cock on the gate,  crowing with might and main.    \"You crow loud enough to deafen one,\" said the donkey; \"what is the  matter with you?\"    \"I prophesied fair weather,\" said the cock, \"because it is our good  mistress's washing-day, and she wants to dry the clothes; but because  to-morrow is Sunday, and company is coming, the mistress has no pity  on me, and has told the cook to put me into the soup to-morrow, and I  must have my head cut off to-night: so now I am crowing with all my  might as long as I can.\"    \"O you old Redhead,\" said the donkey, \"you had better come with us; we  are going to Bremen, where you will certainly find something better  than having your head cut off; you have a good voice, and if we all  make music together, it will be something striking.\"    The cock liked the proposal, and they went on, all four together.    But they could not reach the city of Bremen in one day, and they came  in the evening to a wood, where they agreed to spend the night. The  donkey and the dog laid themselves down under a great tree, but the  cat and the cock went higher--the cock flying up to the topmost  branch, where he was safest. Before he went to sleep he looked round  towards all the four points of the compass, and he thought he saw a  spark shining in the distance. He called to his companions that there  must be a house not far off; for he could see a light. The donkey  said: \"Then we must rise and go to it, for the lodgings here are very  bad;\" and the dog said, \"Yes; a few bones with a little flesh on them  would do me good.\" So they took the road in the direction where the  light was, and soon saw it shine brighter; and it got larger and  larger till they came to a brilliantly-illumined robber's house. The  donkey, being the biggest, got up at the window and looked in.    \"What do you see, Greybeard?\" said the cock.    \"What do I see?\" answered the donkey: \"a table covered with beautiful  food and drink, and robbers are sitting round it and enjoying  themselves.\"    \"That would do nicely for us,\" said the cock.    \"Yes, indeed, if we were only there,\" replied the donkey.    The animals then consulted together how they should manage to drive  out the robbers, till at last they settled on a plan. Tie donkey was  to place himself with his forefeet on the window-sill, the dog to  climb on the donkey's back, and the cat on the dog's, and, at last,  the cock was to fly up and perch himself on the cat's head. When that  was done, at a signal they began their music all together: the donkey  brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock crowed; then, with  one great smash, they dashed through the window into the room, so that  the glass clattered down. The robbers jumped up at this dreadful  noise, thinking that nothing less than a ghost was coming in, and ran  away into the wood in a great fright. The four companions then sat  down at the table,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19737"],[0,"The Principles of Gothic Ecclesiastical Architecture, Elucidated (#20)"],[1,", of stone or  wood, similar to that forming the division between the chancel and nave;  and the space thus enclosed was converted into or became a private chapel  or chantry; for it was anciently the custom, especially during the  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, for lords of manors and persons of  wealth and local importance to build or annex small chapels or side  aisles to their parish churches, and these were endowed by license from  the crown with land sufficient for the maintenance, either wholly or in  part, of one or more priests, who were to celebrate private masses daily  or otherwise, as the endowment expressed, at the altar erected therein,  and dedicated to some saint, for the souls of the founder, his ancestors  and posterity, for whose remains these chantry chapels frequently served  as burial-places. At this service, however, no congregation was required  to be present, but merely the priest, and an acolyte to assist him; and it  was in allusion to the low or private masses thus performed, that Bishop  Jewell, whilst condemning the practice as untenable, observes, \"And even  suche be their private masses, for the most part sayde in side iles,  alone, without companye of people, onely with one boye to make answer.\"    The screens by which these chapels were enclosed have in numerous  instances been destroyed; still many have been preserved, and chantry  chapels parted off the church by screen-work of stone may be found in the  churches of Bradford Abbas, Dorsetshire; and Aldbury, Hertfordshire; in  which latter church is a very perfect specimen of a mortuary chapel, with  a monument and recumbent effigies in the midst of it. Chantry chapels  enclosed on two of the sides by wooden screen-work are more common.    Although no ancient high altar of stone is known to exist, some of the  ancient chantry altars have been preserved: these are composed either of a  solid mass of masonry, covered with a thick slab or table of stone, as in  the north aisle of Bengeworth Church, near Evesham, and in the south aisle  of Enstone Church, Oxfordshire; or of a thick stone slab or table, with a  cross at each angle and in the centre, supported merely on brackets or  trusses built into and projecting from the wall, as in a chantry chapel in  Warmington Church, Warwickshire; or partly on brackets and partly  sustained on shafts or slender piers, as in a chantry chapel,  Chipping-Norton Church, Oxfordshire. Sometimes a chamber containing a  fire-place was constructed over a chantry, apparently for the residence,  either occasional or permanent, of a priest: such a chamber occurs over  the chantry chapel containing the altar in Chipping-Norton Church; and  such also, with the exception of the flooring, which has decayed or been  removed, may be seen in the chantry chapel which contains the altar in  Warmington Church. In both of these chambers are windows or apertures in  the walls which divide them from the church, through which the priest was  enabled to observe unseen any thing passing within the church.    [Illustration: Chantry Altar, Warmington Church, Warwickshire]    We often find an opening or aperture obliquely disposed, carried through  the thickness of the wall at the north-east angle of the south, and the  south-east angle of the north aisle: this was the _hagioscope_, through  which at high mass the elevation of the host at the high altar, and other  ceremonies, might be viewed from the chantry chapel situate at the east  end of each aisle. In general, these apertures are mere narrow oblong  slits; sometimes, however, they partake of a more ornamental character, as  in a chantry chapel on the south side of Irthlingborough Church,  Northamptonshire, where the head of an aperture of this kind is arched,  cinquefoiled within, and finished above with an embattled moulding. In the  north and south transepts of Minster Lovel Church, Oxfordshire, are  oblique openings, arched-headed and foliated; and in the north aisle of  Chipping-Norton Church, in the same county, is a singular hagioscope,  obliquely disposed, not unlike a square-headed window of three foliated  arched lights, with a quatrefoil beneath each light.    We sometimes meet with one or more brackets, with plain mouldings or  sculptured, projecting from the east wall of a chancel aisle or chantry  chapel; and on these, lamps or lights were formerly set, and kept  continually burning in honour of the Virgin or of some other saint; and we  also meet with rich projecting canopies or recessed niches, with brackets  beneath, on which images of saints were formerly placed.    The use of the low side window, common in some districts, near the  south-west angle of the chancel, and sometimes, but not so frequently,  near the north-west angle, and occasionally even in the aisle, has not  been correctly ascertained; it has, however, been conjectured to have  served for the purpose of a confessional; and on minute examination  indications of its formerly having had a wooden shutter, which opened on  the inside, are sometimes visible; and on the south side of Kenilworth  Church, Warwickshire, is an iron-barred window of this description, on  which the wooden shutter is still retained.[209-*]    The sedilia or stone seats, so frequently found in the south wall of the  chancel, are occasionally, though not often, to be met with in the south  walls of side aisles or chantry chapels: when this is the case it is  presumed the endowment was for more priests than one.    Such, not to digress into more minute particulars, may suffice to convey  a general idea of the manner in which our churches were internally  decorated, and how they were fitted up, with reference to the ceremonial  rites of the church of Rome, in and before the year 1535. The walls were  covered with fresco paintings, the windows were glazed with stained glass;  the rood-loft and the pulpit, where the latter existed, were richly  carved, painted, and gilt; and the altars were garnished with plate and  sumptuous hangings. Altar-tombs with cumbent effigies were painted so as  to correspond in tone with the colours displayed on the walls; the  pavement of encaustic tiles, of different devices, was interspersed with  sepulchral slabs and inlaid brasses; and screen-work, niches for statuary,  mouldings, and sculpture of different degrees of excellence, abounded.  Suspended from aloft hung the funeral achievement; at a later period, even  more common, the banner, helme, crest, gauntlets, spurs, sword, targe, and  cote armour.[210-*] In addition to these were, in some churches, shrines  and reliquaries, enriched by the lavish donations of devotees, and wooden  images excessively decked out and appareled[211-*]--objects of  superstition, to which pilgrimages and offerings were made. And if in the  review of the conceptions of a prior age, viz. of the fourteenth century,  we find a higher rank of art to be evinced, and the style and combination  of architectural and sculptured detail to be more severe and pure, at no  period were our churches adorned to greater excess than on the eve of that  in which all were about to undergo spoliation, and many of them wanton  destruction.    For on the suppression of the monasteries and colleges, to the number of  700 and upwards, and of the chantries, in number more than 2300, effected  between the years 1535 and 1540, the abbey churches were not only  despoiled of their costly vestments, altar plate and furniture, and  shrines enriched with silver, gold, and jewels, but many of them were  entirely dismantled, and the sites with the materials granted to  individuals by whom they were soon reduced to a state of ruin. Some were  even, either then or in after-times, converted into dwelling-houses; and  others, or some portion of such, were allowed to be preserved as parochial  churches; but the private chantry altars, though left bare and forsaken,  were not as yet ordered to be destroyed.    By the royal injunctions exhibited A. D. 1538, such feigned images as were  known to be abused of pilgrimages, or offerings of any kind made  thereunto, were, for the avoiding of idolatry, to be forthwith taken down  without delay, and no candles, tapers, or images of wax were from  thenceforth to be set before any image or picture, \"but onelie the light  that commonlie goeth about the crosse of the church by the rood-loft, the  light afore the sacrament of the altar, and the light about the  sepulchre;\" which, for the adorning of the church and divine service, were  for the present suffered to remain. By the same injunctions a Bible of the  largest volume, in English, was directed to be set up in some convenient  place in every church, that the parishioners might resort to the same and  read it; and a register-book was ordered to be kept, for the recording of  christenings, marriages, and burials.    But beyond the suppression of the monasteries and chantries, an act the  effect of secular rather than religious motives, little alteration was  made during the reign of Henry the Eighth in the ceremonies and services  of the church, although the minds of many were becoming prepared for the  change which afterwards ensued. And in the reign of his successor, Edward  the Sixth, a striking difference was effected in the internal appearance  of our churches; for many appendages were, not all at once, but by  degrees, and under the authority of successive injunctions, discarded.  Thus, by the king's injunctions published in 1547, all images which had  been abused with pilgrimage, or offering of any thing made thereunto,  were, for the avoiding of the detestable offence of idolatry, by  ecclesiastical authority, but not by that of private persons, to be taken  down and destroyed; and no torches or candles, tapers or images of wax,  were to be thenceforth suffered to be set before any image or picture,  \"but only two lights upon the high altar before the sacrament, which, for"]]]
