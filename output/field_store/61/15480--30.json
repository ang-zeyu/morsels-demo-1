Plans were  frequently made for the ensuing morning in the dog's presence; and one  day he was not taken; ever after, when Rover heard over night what was  to take place, he started alone, very early, and met the party, sitting  in front of the road with a peculiar kind of grin on his face,  expressing a doubt of being well received, in consequence of coming  without permission. Directly, however, he saw he was well received, he  threw off his affected shyness, and jumped about with delight.    Though a most aristocratic dog in his usual habits, when staying in  England with Mr. St. John, he struck up an acquaintance with a  rat-catcher and his curs, assisting them in their business, watching at  the rat-holes where the ferrets were in, and being the best dog of all;  for he never gave a false alarm, or failed to give a true one. The  moment he saw his master, however, he cut his humble friends, and  declined their acquaintance in the most comical manner.    A dark-brown retriever, named Sam, was in the habit of going into a  kennel of hounds, who always crowded round and caressed him. When they  were in the field at exercise, Sam was told to go and amuse them; he  then went among them, jumped Jim Crow, and played all sorts of antics,  leaping and tumbling about in the most laughable manner, they looking at  him most attentively. He went with his master to call upon a lady; she  patted him, asked if he were the celebrated Sam, and hearing he was, she  invited him to stay with her. The animal ran to his master, looked up,  and seemed to ask for his consent. He was told to return to the lady,  and take care of her, upon which he ran to her, took her basket from  her, and tried to express his willingness to serve her. He remained with  her for some hours, and when his master arrived to fetch him, the lady  was so pleased, that she asked for his company till the next day. Sam's  owner petted and praised him, told him to be a good dog, and stay with  the lady until she had given him his breakfast the next day. The dog was  contented to remain, ate his breakfast on the ensuing morning, then  looked up in the lady's face, wagged his tail, left the house, and ran  home. He was in the habit of fetching his master's clothes, and of  returning them to their proper places; and he knew their names. He sat  in a chair at dinner with the family, without making any confusion; or  dined alone, alternately taking a piece of bread and meat, and then  drinking a little milk; and if any one said, \"Give me a piece, Sam,\" he  instantly obeyed. When all was gone, he cleared away the things. He  would fetch his master's horse from the inn, pay the hostler, and ride  back upon the saddle. In short, he seemed to comprehend every thing that  was said to him and was a model of good nature and obedience.    Wonderful as these stories are as matters of reason, they are perhaps  exceeded by some of the tricks performed by the Poodle-Dogs, who are  easily distinguished by their crisply curling hair, their large round  head, and long ears, and to whom water is as welcome and familiar as  land. Two of them, educated in Milan, exhibited their powers in Paris,  and I can vouch for the veracity of the following statement:--The elder  was named Fido, and the younger Bianco. The former was a serious, steady  dog, who walked about with much solemnity; but Bianco was giddy and  frolicsome. A word was given to Fido from the Greek, Latin, Italian,  French, or English languages, and selected from a book, where fifty  words in each tongue were inscribed, which, altogether, made three  hundred combinations. He selected from the letters of the alphabet those  which composed the given word, and laid them in order at the feet of his  master. On one occasion, the word _heaven_ was told to him, and he  quickly placed the letters till he came to the second _e_, when, after  vainly searching for the letter in his alphabet, he took it from the  first syllable, and inserted it in the second. He went through the four  first rules of arithmetic in the same way, with extraordinary celerity,  and arranged the double cyphers in the same way as the double vowel in  heaven. Bianco, however, although so heedless, was quicker than Fido,  and when the latter made a mistake, was called on to rectify it, but as  quickly dismissed, as he was wont to pull his companion's ears, to come  and play with him.    One day Fido spelt the word _Jupiter_ with a _b_, but the younger  _savant_ being summoned to correct the error, he carefully contemplated  the word, and pushing out the _b_, replaced it with a _p_. A lady held  her repeating watch to the ear of Fido, and made it strike eight and  three quarters. Fido immediately selected an 8, and then a 6, for the  three-quarters; the company present and the master insisted upon his  error, and he again looked among his cyphers, but being unable to  rectify it, he coolly sat himself down in the middle and looked at those  around him. The watch was again sounded, and it was ascertained that it  struck two for every quarter, which quite exonerated Fido. Both dogs  would sit down to play ecarte, asking each other for, or refusing cards,  with the most important and significant look, cutting at proper times,  and never mistaking one card for another. Bianco occasionally won, and  went to the cyphers to mark his points, and when he was asked how many  his adversary had gained, he took out an 0 with his teeth. They  sometimes played at ecarte with one of the company assembled to see  them, when they evinced the same correctness, and seemed to know all the  terms of the game. All this passed without the slightest audible or  visible sign between them and their master.    There is a water dog at Hastings, belonging to Page the boatman, who, on  receiving a penny, immediately takes it to a baker's shop for the  purchase of a roll, nor will he part with it till the person who serves  him has put the bread upon the counter; he then lays it down, and walks  off with his purchase in his mouth. Another dog of this kind, also of my  acquaintance, was the family carrier; that is, she carried books, work,  etc., to any person or any room pointed out to her; and as we rather  encroached on her, she lost almost all her teeth from the hard and heavy  burthens with which she was laden. We had only to say, \"Cora, take this  to so and so,\" and if the good dog could not find the person, she  brought it back and stood before us. At the same hour every afternoon,  she, untold, brought her master's boot-jack and slippers into his study,  to be in readiness for his return.    Under the despised name of curs, Colonel Smith classes the sharpest, the  drollest, the most pertinacious, the most mischievous, and yet the most  useful terrier; together with several other small dogs. Long-haired,  rough-haired, long-eared, short-eared, brush-tailed, smooth-tailed,  long-legged, short-legged, black-eyed, black-nosed; white, brown, black,  tan, sandy, mixed; every degree of pure or mongrel blood; terriers of  all kinds swarm around us, playing all sorts of antics, evincing all  kinds of impertinences, catching all sorts of vermin, and presenting  themselves to us in every shape of beauty or ugliness, of which their  race is capable.    The most ancient of this influential, if not respectable tribe of dogs,  indeed the most ancient dog of Great Britain, is the Scotch Terrier,  brought to us, probably, from the north-west of Europe by our primitive  inhabitants. There are two varieties of indigenous terriers--the one,  smooth, usually white or black in colour, with tan spots; sharp muzzle;  bright and lively eyes; pointed or slightly turned-down ears; and tail  carried high. It is, however, supposed that the Scottish race, with a  shorter and fuller muzzle, stouter limbs, hard, shaggy fur, sometimes  white in colour, but more often sandy or ochry, is the oldest and most  genuine breed. One of these clever and excellent beasts, named Peter,  lived with my mother for some years, and during the whole of that time  evinced the greatest sagacity and attachment. He constantly understood  the conversation, provided it related to cats, rats, or himself; and  often when we spoke of him casually, without even knowing he was in the  room, or calling him by his name, he has laid his head on our knees and  wagged his tail, as much as to say, \"I understand.\" He was a most  inveterate enemy to all rats, mice, and cats, nipping them in the back  of the neck, and throwing them over his head at the rate of one in a  minute. Before he came into our family, he won a wager that he would  kill twelve rats in twelve minutes: the second rat fastened on his lip,  and hung there while he despatched the other ten, and then, within the  given time, he finished that also. The inhumanity of such wagers did not  rest with him. He was stolen more than once, and brought back when a  reward was advertised; and, the first time, the signs of suffering about  him were very manifest. The beard under the chin, the tufts of the ears,  the fringes of the legs, had been all cut off, and he had been rubbed  with red ochre to disguise him for sale. He was placed with many others  in a cellar, ready for shipping, and the dog-dealer, or rather  dog-stealer, who brought him to us, said he thought he would have died  of grief in a day or two, for he refused to eat, and seemed to be  insensible either to kindness or anger. For three weeks he hung his head  and shrunk into corners, as if he felt himself degraded; but at last our  caresses and encouragement brought back his usual bold and lively  bearing.    For the last three months of my mother's existence, Peter was almost  always on her bed, night and day; and during the final"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21986"],[0,"The Dash for Khartoum: A Tale of the Nile Expedition (#20)"],[1," would be their destination;  but it was soon known that the regiment was for the present to be  stationed in Egypt. Most of the men would rather have gone direct to  India, where soldiers are better off and better cared for than  elsewhere. Edgar, however, was pleased at the thought of seeing  something of Egypt, and it seemed to him, too, that there was a chance  of active service there.    \"It seems to me,\" he said, talking it over with several of his chums,  \"that sooner or later we must have some fighting in Egypt. I cannot  understand how it is that some of the regiments there have not long ago  been sent down to Suakim. We have smashed up the Egyptian army, and it  seems to me that as we are really masters of the place we are bound to  protect the natives from these savage tribes who are attacking them down  on the Red Sea and up in the Soudan. The Egyptians always managed them  well enough until we disbanded their army. If Hicks Pasha had had, as he  asked for, an English regiment or two with him, he would never have been  smashed up by the Mahdi's people; and it seems to me awful that the  garrisons of Sinkat and Tokar should be deserted when we have a lot of  troops lying idle at Cairo, while Baker is trying in vain to get up a  native force to march to their relief. I wish, instead of going to  Egypt, we were going straight down to Suakim to help him. There is one  thing, if Baker fails and Sinkat and Tokar fall into the hands of the  natives, there will be such indignation that government will have to do  something. So I think there is a very good chance of our seeing some  active service there, which will be a thousand times better than  sweltering in hot barracks in Cairo.\"    \"Right you are, Smith,\" one of the others said. \"I don't go in for  reading the papers, and I don't know anything about the chaps in Egypt;  but if there is going to be a row, I say let us have our share in it. We  are pretty well up in the pursuing drill; it would be a change to do it  with somebody to pursue. Anyhow, wherever it is it will be a good job to  get out of Aldershot, with its parades and its drills and its Long  Valley, and the whole blooming lot of it.\"    Three days later the order came, and the regiment proceeded by rail to  Southampton; they embarked as soon as they arrived there, and the  transport started on the following morning. The weather was fine, and  the voyage a pleasant one. They had but little to do, for they had left  their horses behind them, as they were to take over the horses of the  regiment they were going to relieve. The steamer was a fast one, and in  twelve days after sailing they reached Alexandria. They were met when  they arrived there by terrible news. General Baker's force had marched  to the relief of Tokar, but on the way had been attacked by the natives  and utterly defeated, half the force being killed; and the whole would  have been annihilated had they not reached the sea-shore, where the guns  of the vessels which had brought them down from Suakim checked the  pursuit of the enemy. Sinkat had fallen.    The news had arrived only on the previous day, and the greatest  excitement prevailed. The regiment at once proceeded to Cairo by train  and took over the barracks and horses from the small detachment that had  been left in charge of them, the main body of the regiment having  crossed them on their journey from Alexandria, as they were to proceed  to India in the same steamer that had brought out the Hussars. They were  scarcely settled in their quarters before they heard that, now that it  was too late, an expedition was to be sent down to Suakim. Two English  regiments would have saved Baker's force from destruction, and would  have rescued the garrisons of Sinkat and Tokar; now a large force would  have to be employed. Some time would, of course, be needed for the  organization of the expedition, and in the meantime the Hussars had  plenty of opportunity for investigating Cairo.    To Edgar the town was delightful, with its bazaar and its varied  population, and he and some of his comrades were never tired of  wandering about examining the shops with their curious contents, their  bright-coloured scarves, their wonderful pipes, their gaudy brasswork,  and their oriental stuffs and carpets. But the population were even more  amusing, with the mixture of Egyptians, Arabs, and Negroes clad in every  variety of garb: from the Egyptian functionary in his neat blue uniform  and fez, and the portly merchant in his oriental robes, to the Arabs  muffled up in cotton cloths with turban and bernous, the lightly-clad  Fellah, and the women shrouded in dark blue cottons with their faces  almost entirely hidden by the yashmack. It needed some dexterity to  avoid the strings of loaded camels that made their way through the  narrow streets, the porters carrying heavy weights hanging from the  centre of a thick bamboo pole resting on the shoulders of two or four  men, and the diminutive donkeys with their high saddles, on the top of  which were perched men who looked far more capable of carrying the  donkeys than the donkeys of supporting their weight.    The men soon discovered that spirits were cheap in Cairo, and the result  was a considerable addition to the number brought up at the orderly-room  for drunkenness. Among these, to Edgar's satisfaction, was Corporal  North, who was at once sent back to the ranks and sentenced to a week in  the cells. On the day he came out Edgar went up to him.    \"Now look here, North. You have made it pretty hot for me while you were  corporal. If I had given you any cause for it I should bear no malice,  but it has been simply persecution. As long as you were corporal I had  to grin and bear it, but now that you are in the ranks we can settle  matters; so I challenge you to meet me in the riding-school after we are  dismissed from parade to-day.\"    \"That will suit me exactly,\" North said. \"You want a licking badly,  young fellow, and now you will get it.\"    \"Well, if I were you I would say nothing about it until it is over,\"  Edgar replied; \"for, you see, it is quite possible that it may be the  other way.\"    As several of the men had heard the conversation there was a  considerable gathering in the riding-school after they were dismissed  from parade. The sympathies of the men were strongly with Edgar; but  most of them thought that he was hardly a match for North, who had  fought several times before he had got his stripes, and was a  well-built young fellow of two-and-twenty.    The fight lasted upwards of an hour. North had some knowledge of boxing,  but in this respect Edgar was his superior. He was far stronger and  longer in the reach, while Edgar was the more active. In the early part  of the fight the advantage lay all with the soldier, and Edgar was  terribly knocked about, so much so that the general opinion was that he  had better give in and say that he had had enough; but Edgar laughed at  the suggestion.    \"We have only begun yet,\" he said to the man who was acting as his  second; \"last tells in the long run. I have seen that before now, and I  have double the last he has.\"    This was the fact. Edgar had been constantly at hard work since he  joined the regiment, while North had had a comparatively easy time of it  since he became a corporal. He had, too, spent no small portion of his  pay in drink, and although he was seldom absolutely drunk, had had more  than one narrow escape of his condition being observed on his return to  barracks in the evening. As the fight went on, then, want of condition  told upon him. Edgar, who had at one time seemed weak, gradually  recovered his strength, while North became exhausted by the exertions he  had made in the early part of the fight.    Edgar now took the offensive, and at the end of an hour and a quarter's  fighting North was no longer able to come up to time, and a loud shout  from the lookers-on proclaimed that Edgar was the victor. He went across  to North and held out his hand.    \"Let us shake hands, North,\" he said; \"it has been a good tough fight. I  owe you no malice now, and if you get your stripes again, as I daresay  you will, I hope it will be a lesson to you not to drop unfairly upon  anyone you may take a dislike to.\"    North took the hand held out to him.    \"You have licked me fairly, Smith,\" he said. \"I did not think you had  it in you; but I don't think you would have thrashed me if I had been in  as good a condition as you are.\"    \"Very likely not,\" Edgar laughed. \"Well, next time we fight I hope it  will be against the Arabs, and not against each other.\"    This fight greatly added to Edgar's reputation in the regiment. North  was not a popular character and had always been considered a bully, and  the pluck with which Edgar had continued the fight was thoroughly  appreciated. Neither of the combatants were able to take their place in  the ranks for some days after the fight, being obliged to obtain an  order from the surgeon dispensing them from appearing on parade, though  they still did stable duty and inner guards. Through the surgeon the  matter came to the ears of the officers, who, by quiet inquiry from the  sergeants, learnt the particulars of the fight.    \"Your friend Trumpeter Smith is reported as unfit for duty, my dear,\"  Major Horsley said to his wife.    \"Is he! I am sorry for that,\" the lady said. \"Is there anything we can  do for him in the way of sending him some soup, or anything of that  sort? He is not seriously ill, I hope?\"    \"I am afraid he is beyond your skill, Emma,\" Major Horsley said; and  then, seeing that his wife looked seriously grieved, went on, \"don't be  alarmed, he has only been fighting again.\"    \"Oh! is that all? I was afraid it was fever, or something of that sort.  Who has he been fighting with? He doesn't look quarrelsome at all.\"    \"He has been fighting with a man named North, who was a corporal in his  troop, and who, "]]]
