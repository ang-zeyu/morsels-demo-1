Occasionally great battles take place between a buffalo and a lion, or  more often two or three lions attack a buffalo, who rarely escapes them.  The strength of a lion is almost beyond our comprehension when we  remember that one can actually carry a cow over an ordinary-sized fence.    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN GOAT HAS MANY MEANS OF DEFENCE, NOT THE LEAST OF  WHICH IS HIS AGILITY IN CLIMBING TO INACCESSIBLE PLACES.]    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    WILD BOARS ARE AMONG THE MOST FEROCIOUS OF ANIMALS. BY MEANS OF THEIR  GREAT STRENGTH ALONE THEY ARE WELL ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.]    A most unique fighter is the giraffe. He has neither claws nor sharp  teeth with which to defend himself; so, if he gets angry with one of his  kind, he deliberately uses his long neck like a pile driver would use a  sledge hammer. Swinging it round and round, he lets his head descend  upon his adversary like a heavy ax! The two animals use the same kind of  tactics, and bracing themselves so as to stand the blows, they fight  until one has to give in. Their heads are furnished with two small  knob-like horns which only protect them from the heavy blows without  serving as offensive weapons.    Most singular and amusing of all methods of self-defence are those which  entirely depend for their efficiency upon bluff, or pretence. The  chameleon, for example, erects his snake-like hood, though he is  harmless, and at the most could scarcely injure the smallest animal.  Equally curious are the methods of skunks and polecats, which project  against enemies a highly disagreeable fluid.    Passive modes of defence are as many and varied as are the active; one  of the strangest and most inexplicable of these is that known as  spontaneous amputation, technically termed autotomy. The lizard, for  example, when captured, will abruptly break loose his tail in order to  escape; and certain wood rats, when caught, loosen the skin on their  tails and deliberately slip away. Autotomy not only permits flight, but  also defends the animal against the most adverse conditions. Nearest  akin to this--defence by means of amputation--is the practice of bears  and raccoons of amputating their limbs when caught in steel traps.    Mimicry, which is treated under another chapter, comes under the head of  passive defence, and form and colour play an important part in it.  Strangely enough, animals which have never resorted to mimicry as a  means of protection, when associated with others who practice it, take  on the habit themselves. This may possibly be due to the fact that new  enemies are constantly arising.    As human sharpshooters dress in garments of the same colour as the woods  in which they hunt, so many animals use this principle of imitation. The  colour of most animals is very similar to their surroundings. This  enables them to lie in wait for prey, a practice as old as the hillsides  with animals. They have learned the extreme value of silence, and that  they must remain at times motionless. This is especially noticeable with  crocodiles, which wait for whole days without moving, concealed in the  water or deep grass, until their prey comes within striking distance,  when they pounce upon it. The same is true of the python snake, which  hangs from a tree so immovable that he appears like a vine or a branch  of the tree. If an animal attempts to pass, he drops upon it.    Perhaps the most unique and successful method of passive defence is the  feigning of death, or \"playing 'possum\" met with in several animals,  such as the red fox, the opossum, occasionally the elephant, and several  of the snakes. On many occasions I have been 'possum hunting in the  South and found my dog barking at an apparently dead 'possum. As soon as  these animals are approached by larger and stronger enemies, they drop  absolutely motionless on the ground and close their eyes as though they  were dead. Here they remain until the enemy either destroys them,  carries them away, or leaves them alone. If left alone for a few  moments, they immediately spring to their feet and make their escape.    Elephants often feign death when captured, in order to gain their  liberty. Animal catchers tell many interesting tales of elephants  feigning weakness from which they fall to the earth and later apparently  die. In many instances the fastenings are removed from their legs and  head and the carcass is abandoned as useless, when to the utter  astonishment of all--before the captors get out of sight--the animal  springs up and dashes away to the forest, screaming with joy at the  triumph of its deception.    Many animals deliberately assume a frightful, terrifying or grotesque  appearance. This they do by inflating their bodies, by erecting hair,  skin, or folds, or by unusual poses. Darwin speaks of the hissing of  certain snakes, the rattle of the rattle-snake, the grating of the  scales of the echis, each of which serves to frighten or terrify the  enemy.    Bluffing is another form of defence that many animals use. The cobra,  for example, when disturbed, raises its immense hood in a most  terrifying attitude! Many of the lizards use the same tactics; while the  horned toads of America when disturbed actually eject blood from their  eyes. Every one is familiar with the cat's habit of raising the fur on  his back when molested by a dog. All bluffing animals, when in danger,  try to assume a pose that will make them look most dangerous and  impressive to their enemies, and there is little doubt that in most  cases they succeed very well, for we have all seen a dog slink away from  a menacing cat.    The elk or moose, whose home is in the northern part of America and  Europe, is a powerful and large animal, sometimes seven feet in height,  and is able to endure much cold. He has many enemies among animals and  mankind, and during the summer season he is quite able to protect  himself, but in winter there is considerable danger from hordes of  wolves. This is especially true just after a heavy snowstorm, if the  snow is wet and melting. When it is dry and frozen, he can travel over  it with great speed, and this he does by a most unusual trot which  carries him along much faster than the trotting gait of a horse. Thus he  is able to escape the hungry, carnivorous wolves, whose courage  increases with appetite. If crowded too close, he is able also to  protect himself by the most terrific blows of his fore-feet.    But when the spring weather sets in, and the snows begin to melt  underneath, leaving the upper crust sufficiently strong to support the  weight of lighter and smaller animals, such as wolves, especially when  they travel swiftly, he is in great danger. For with every step he sinks  to the belly in the snow, while his enemies can walk right up to his  head and shoulders without his being able to strike or paw them with his  dangerous hoofs. The advantage seems to be with the wolves, and if ever  they bring the moose to bay in the snow, his life is doomed. For they  care little for his arrow-like horns, but boldly jump at his throat and  kill him. Herein comes the elk's wisdom--he deliberately sets to work,  before the snow melts, and builds for himself and family an elk-yard,  which is nothing more than a large space of ground on which the snow is  smoothed or trampled down until it becomes a hard surface on which he  can walk; it is also surrounded by a high wall of snow, through which  are certain exits that allow him to pass out, if he desires. All the  enclosed space is not smoothed down, but parts of it only are cut up  into roads through which he may pass very swiftly. Woe unto the daring  wolves that enter his snowy fortification--his \"No Man's Land\"--- for  sure death awaits them!    A sense of law, order, government; the sacredness of family ties--all  these aid in the protection of animals. Family life with them originated  just as it did in the human world. The social instinct and the moral  sentiments which arise from social relations in man and animal are the  same. Moral obligations, especially in relation to family ties and  conjugal unions of animals, are in many cases sacred binders to such  ties. The bear, for example, is proverbial for his conjugal  faithfulness. The married life of most animals is strictly moral, and  most of them are monogamists and have reached the highest form of family  association and life.    In those places where they live promiscuously, it gives them the same  protection in herds as it does among our lower savages. Cattle, sheep,  and horses unite for mutual protection; wolves band together in packs;  and after they have been domesticated there is still not only a strong  desire to band together for social purposes, but also to hold courts of  justice. It sometimes happens that an angered husband takes the law in  his hands, like uncivilised men, and beats his wife.    In the development and organisation of social and civil life the horse  and the goat hold the foremost position. It corresponds to that of man  among the lower animals. They do not believe in monarchies, but strictly  in republics, or rather, a democracy where all power comes from the  working class. The claims of the working class to the exercise of  supreme control in all political affairs are practically realised. Among  a herd of wild Arabian horses, the leading stallion, or so-called king,  is really only the father of the tribe; his functions are paternal  rather than regal. If he may be said to reign in a certain sense, the  true workers rule, and his scouts and sentinels obey his wishes which  the workers have influenced and formulated.    The existence of but one king leaves no room for dynastic troubles and  rivalries which disturb, so often, our human countries and empires with  such dreadful results.

Louis, it puts me in mind  of the man in your tale, who had to bind his legs for fear he should  outrun the hares. I am, however, heartily glad for you, and amazingly  sorry we should have so misunderstood you.\"    \"Louis Mortimer,\" cried a little boy, very smartly dressed, \"mamma  wants to look at your medal--will you come and show it to her?\"    \"And go off, Reginald, with him, and tell Lady Stanhope all the news,\"  said Vernon, as Louis went away with little Stanhope; \"I will come and  pay my respects as soon as it is convenient for me to be aware of her  ladyship's presence.\"    Louis' medal was examined and passed from hand to hand, and many  compliments were made on the occasion. Lady Stanhope was very kind,  and would hear the history, a command Reginald was by no manner of  means unwilling to obey, though he suppressed the name of the guilty  party. The doctor was in great request, for many of the ladies were  very anxious to know more of \"that lovely boy,\" but he was very guarded  in his accounts of the matter, though bearing the strongest testimony  to Louis' good conduct. He turned to Mr. Percy, who was present, and  said, quietly, \"That, sir, is the boy you mentioned to me at Easter;  the son of Mr. Mortimer, of Dashwood.\"    The excitement was almost too much for Louis, tried as he had been  lately by unusual fagging and early rising. He was glad to get away  into the playground, and after watching one or two departures he ran  wildly about, now and then laughing aloud in his delight, \"Oh! papa and  mamma, how glad they will be!\" and then the well-spring of deep gladness  seemed to overflow, and the excess of happiness and gratitude made him  mute. His heart swelled with emotions too great for any words; a deep  sense of mercies and goodness of which he was unworthy, but for which  he felt as if he could have poured out his being in praise. Oh the  blessing of a thankful heart! How happy is he who sees his Father's  hand in every thing that befalls him, and in whom each mercy calls  forth a gush of gratitude!        \"Ten thousand thousand precious gifts         My daily thanks employ;       Nor is the least a thankful heart,         To taste those gifts with joy.\"                                      ADDISON.    The playground was empty, for the boys were either engaged with their  friends, or else departing; and Louis, from his little nook, saw many  vehicles of different descriptions drive away from the door. When the  dinner-bell rang he re-entered the house, but the dinner-table looked  very empty--there was not half the usual party.    \"Where have you been, Louis?\" asked Reginald, as he entered; \"I have  been looking everywhere for you. Hamilton was quite vexed to go away  without bidding you goodbye, and he begged me to do it for him.\"    \"I am very sorry, indeed,\" said Louis; \"I have been in the playground.  Reginald, does it not make you feel very pleasant to see the heap of  boxes in the hall? I stood a long time looking at our directions.\"    \"I am almost cracked,\" cried Reginald, joyously;--        \"'Midsummer's coming again, my boys,        Jolly Midsummer and all its joys!'\"    How far Reginald's reminiscences of his holiday song might have  continued, I cannot pretend to say, had it not been interrupted by  a desire from the presiding master, that \"he would recollect himself,  and where he was;\" but order was out of the question, most of the party  being in Reginald's condition--and, after several useless appeals to  the sense of gentlemanly decorum proper to be observed by the noisy  party, Mr. Witworth found his best plan would be to let every thing  pass that did not absolutely interfere with the business in hand, and,  dinner being over, the ill-mannered troop dispersed. Several of them,  among whom were Reginald and Louis, stopped in the hall to feast their  eyes on the piles of trunks and portmanteaus; and Reginald discovered  that a direction was wanting on one of theirs; \"And I declare, Louis,  see what Frank has been doing.\"    Louis laughed, as he perceived that one of the directions on his luggage  was altered to \"Lady Louisa Mortimer,\" and ran away to rectify it. When  he returned, the party in the hall was considerably enlarged, and Ferrers  came towards him to wish him good-bye. \"Good-bye, Louis, I am coming back  next half-year,\" he said, in a low tone; \"and you must help me to regain  my character.\" Louis squeezed his hand, and promised to write to him,  though he hoped, he said, that he should not come back himself; and when  Ferrers left the hall, the business of affixing the necessary directions  went on very busily. Reginald was in a state of such overflowing delight,  as to be quite boisterous, and now and then burst out into snatches of  noisy songs, rendered remarkably effective by an occasional squeak and  grunt, which proclaimed his voice to be rather unmanageable.    \"Now, Louis, here's a piece of string, and my knife.        'Christmas is coming again, my boys!'\"    \"_Christmas_, Reginald--Midsummer!\" cried Louis, laughing.    \"Well then, ah, well! tie it tight.          'Midsummer's coming again, my boys,          Jolly Midsummer, and all its joys;          And we're all of us cracked, so we'll kick up a noise.      _Chorus_. Ri-toorul-loor, rul-loor, rul-loor-rul. Hip, hip, hurrah!          Hollo!'\"    The sensible chorus was shouted at the utmost pitch of the voices  of the assembled youths, who waved hats, hands, and handkerchiefs,  during the process.    \"Bravissimo!\" exclaimed Reginald, quite red with his exertions, and  beaming with excitement. \"But my beautiful voice is very unruly; the  last few times I have tried to sing, it has been quite disobedient.  I think it must be cracked, at last.\"    \"Are you not pleased?\" said Louis, archly.    \"Not particularly,\" replied Reginald.    \"You said you should be, last Christmas. Do you remember the ladies  at grandpapa's?\"    \"Well, there is that comfort at any rate,\" said Reginald, \"we shan't  have any more of their humbug; but think of the dear old madrigals,  and--it's no laughing matter, Mr. Louis, for all your fun.\"    \"Acknowledge, then, that you spoke rashly, when you said you should  be glad of it,\" said Louis, who was full of merriment at his brother's  misfortune.    And now Vernon, Arthur, and Frank Digby pressed forward, to bid good-bye.    As Vernon shook Louis' hand, he said, \"I shall see you at Heronhurst,  I suppose.\"    \"I suppose _I_ mustn't dare to go,\" said Frank.    \"And now I shall go and gather some of those white roses by the wall,  for mamma,\" said Louis. \"I hope it won't be very long, Reginald, they  must be here soon--oh, how delightful it will be!\"    Louis ran off, and succeeded in finding a few half-blown roses for his  dear mother, and was engaged in carefully cutting off the thorns, when  one of his school-fellows ran up to him, and called out that his father  and mother were come.    \"Papa and mamma! Where's Reginald?\" he cried, and flew over the  playground without waiting for an answer. \"Where are papa and mamma?  Where is Reginald?\" he cried, as he ran into the hall. His hurried  question was as quickly answered; and Louis, jumping over the many  packages, made his way to the drawing-room. Here were his dear father  and mother, with Dr. Wilkinson. Reginald had been in the room several  minutes; and when Louis entered, was standing by his mother, whose arm  was round him, and close behind him stood his father.    \"My Louis!\" was his mother's affectionate greeting, and the next moment  he was in her arms, his own being clasped tightly round her neck, and he  could only kiss her in speechless joy, at first; and then, when the kind  arms that strained him to her bosom were loosened, there was his dear  father, and then words came, and as he looked with flashing eyes and  crimsoned cheek, from one to the other, he exclaimed, \"Oh, mamma! I  have a medal--mamma, it is all come out! Papa, I am innocent; I have  a character now! Oh, dear mamma, I said it would--I am quite cleared!\"    His head sank on his father's shoulder; a strange, dull sound in his  head overpowered him; a slight faintness seemed to blow over his face;  his eyes were fixed and glassy, and he became unconscious. Mr. Mortimer  changed color, and hastily catching the falling boy, he carried him to  the sofa. Dr. Wilkinson sent Reginald immediately for some water, but  before he could return, and almost before Mrs. Mortimer could raise her  dear boy's head from the pillow to her shoulder, the color came again,  and his eyes resumed their natural expression.    \"What was the matter, my darling?\" said his mother, kissing him.    \"I don't know, mamma,\" replied Louis, sitting up. \"I only felt giddy,  and something like a little wind in my face.\"    \"I think he has been overwrought,\" said Dr. Wilkinson, kindly; \"he has  gone through a great deal lately. We will take him up stairs and let  him lie down; I think he wants a little quiet.\"    \"I am quite well now,\" said Louis.    \"I will sit by your side; you had better go up stairs, dear,\"  said his mother.    Louis yielded, and Mr. Mortimer assisted him up stairs, despite his  declarations that he was quite strong and well, and, being laid on a  bed, Mrs. Mortimer stationed herself by his side.    All they said I have not time to relate, but long Louis lay with his  mother's hand in both of his, telling her of the events of the last  two months, and often she bent her head down and kissed his broad  forehead and flushed cheek; and when she would not let him talk any  more, he lay very passively, his eyes filling with grateful tears,  and now and then in the overflowing of his heart, raising them to  his mother, with \"Mamma, thank God for me. Oh, how very grateful  I ought to be!\"    At length he fell asleep, and his mother sat still, watching the quiet  face, and the glittering tear-drop "]]]
