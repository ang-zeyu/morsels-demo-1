These troops who refused to go over and accept a victory already won for  them, because they didn't want to cross the Canadian line, would not  have shied so at the boundary if they had been boodlers, very likely, in  later years.    August 19 occurred the naval fight between the Constitution and  Guerriere, off the Massachusetts coast. The Constitution, called \"Old  Ironsides,\" was commanded by Captain Isaac Hull. The Guerriere was first  to attack, but got no reply until both vessels were very close together,  when into her starboard Captain Hull poured such a load of hardware  that the Guerriere was soon down by the head and lop-sided on the off  side. She surrendered, but was of no value, being so full of holes that  she would not hold a cargo of railroad-trestles.    [Illustration: IF THEY HAD BEEN BOODLERS.]    The economy used by the early American warriors by land and sea  regarding their ammunition, holding their fire until the enemy was at  arm's length, was the cause of more than one victory. They were obliged,  indeed, to make every bullet count in the days when even lead was not  produced here, and powder was imported.    October 13, the naval fight between the Frolic and Wasp took place, off  the North Carolina coast. The Frolic was an English brig, and she wound  up as most frolics do, with a severe pain and a five-dollar fine. After  the Wasp had called and left her R. S. V. P. cards, the decks of the  Frolic were a sight to behold. There were not enough able-bodied men to  surrender the ship. She was captured by the boarding-crew, but there was  not a man left of her own crew to haul down the colors.    Other victories followed on the sea, and American privateers had more  fun than anybody.    Madison was re-elected, thus showing that his style of administration  suited one and all, and the war was prosecuted at a great rate. It  became a sort of fight with Canada, the latter being supported by  English arms by land and sea. Of course the Americans would have  preferred to fight England direct, and many were in favor of attacking  London: but when the commanding officer asked those of the army who had  the means to go abroad to please raise their right hands, it was found  that the trip must be abandoned. Those who had the means to go did not  have suitable clothes for making a respectable appearance, and so it was  given up.    Three divisions were made of the army, all having an attack on Canada as  the object in view,--viz., the army of the Centre, the army of the  North, and the army of the West. The armies of the Centre and North did  not do much, aside from the trifling victory at York, and President  Madison said afterwards in a letter to the writer's family that the two  armies did not accomplish enough to pay the duty on them. The army of  the West managed to stand off the British, though the latter still held  Michigan and threatened Ohio.    [Illustration: BUILDING THE FLEET, MEANTIME BOARDING HIMSELF.]    September 10, Perry's victory on Lake Erie occurred, and was well  received. Perry was twenty-seven years old, and was given command of a  flotilla on Lake Erie, provided he would cut the timber and build it,  meantime boarding himself. The British had long been in possession of  Lake Erie, and when Perry got his scows afloat they issued invitations  for a general display of carnage. They bore down on Perry and killed all  the men on his flag-ship but eight. Then he helped them fire the last  gun, and with the flag they jumped into a boat which they paddled for  the Niagara under a galling fire. This was the first time that a galling  fire had ever been used at sea. Perry passed within pistol-shot of the  British, and in less than a quarter of an hour after he trod the poop of  the Niagara he was able to write to General Harrison, \"We have met the  enemy, and they are ours.\"    Proctor and Tecumseh were at Malden, with English and Indians, preparing  to plunder the frontier and kill some more women and children as soon as  they felt rested up. At the news of Perry's victory, Harrison decided to  go over and stir them up. Arriving at Malden, he found it deserted, and  followed the foe to the river Thames, where he charged with his Kentucky  horsemen right through the British lines and so on down the valley,  where they reformed and started back to charge on their rear, when the  whole outfit surrendered except the Indians. Proctor, however, was  mounted on a tall fox-hunter which ran away with him. He afterwards  wrote back to General Harrison that he made every effort to surrender  personally, but that circumstances prevented. He was greatly pained by  this.    The Americans now charged on the Indians, and Johnson, the commander of  the Blue Grass Dragoons, fired a shot which took Tecumseh just west of  the watch-pocket. He died, he said, tickled to death to know that he  had been shot by an American.    [Illustration: PROCTOR ON A TALL FOX-HUNTER WHICH RAN AWAY WITH HIM.]    Captain Lawrence, of the Hornet, having taken the British brig Peacock,  was given command of the Chesapeake, which he took to Boston to have  repaired. While there, he got a challenge from the Shannon. He put to  sea with half a crew, and a shot in his chest--that is, the arm-chest of  the ship--burst the whole thing open and annoyed every one on board. The  enemy boarded the Chesapeake and captured her, so Captain Lawrence, her  brave commander, breathed his last, after begging his men not to give up  the ship.    However, the victories on the Canadian border settled the war once more  for the time, and cheered the Americans very much.    The Indians in 1813 fell upon Fort Mimms and massacred the entire  garrison, men, women, and children, not because they felt a personal  antipathy towards them, but because they--the red brothers--had sold  their lands too low and their hearts were sad in their bosoms. There is  really no fun in trading with an Indian, for he is devoid of business  instincts, and reciprocity with the red brother has never been a  success.    General Jackson took some troops and attacked the red brother, killing  six hundred of him and capturing the rest of the herd. Jackson did not  want to hear the Indians speak pieces and see them smoke the pipe of  peace, but buried the dead and went home. He had very little of the  romantic complaint which now and then breaks out regarding the Indian,  but knew full well that all the Indians ever born on the face of the  earth could not compensate for the cruel and violent death of one good,  gentle, patient American mother.    Admiral Cockburn now began to pillage the coast of the Southern States  and borrow communion services from the churches of Virginia and the  Carolinas. He also murdered the sick in their beds.    Perhaps a word of apology is due the Indians after all. Possibly they  got their ideas from Cockburn.    The battle of Lundy's Lane had been arranged for July 25, 1814, and so  the Americans crossed Niagara under General Brown to invade Canada.  General Winfield Scott led the advance, and gained a brilliant victory,  July 5, at Chippewa. The second engagement was at Lundy's Lane, within  the sound of the mighty cataract. Old man Lundy, whose lane was used for  the purpose, said that it was one of the bloodiest fights, by a good  many gallons, that he ever attended. The battle was, however, barren of  results, the historian says, though really an American victory from the  stand-point of the tactician and professional gore-spiller.    In September, Sir George Prevost took twelve thousand veteran troops who  had served under Wellington, and started for Plattsburg. The ships of  the British at the same time opened fire on the nine-dollar American  navy, and were almost annihilated. The troops under Prevost started in  to fight, but, learning of the destruction of the British fleet on Lake  Champlain, Prevost fled like a frightened fawn, leaving his sick and  wounded and large stores of lime-juice, porridge, and plum-pudding. The  Americans, who had been living on chopped horse-feed and ginseng-root,  took a week off and gave themselves up to the false joys of lime-juice  and general good feeling.    [Illustration: HIS RAINBOW SMILE.]    Along the coast the British destroyed everything they could lay their  hands on; but perhaps the rudest thing they did was to enter Washington  and burn the Capitol, the Congressional library, and the smoke-house in  which President Madison kept his hams. Even now, when the writer is a  guest of some great English dignitary, and perhaps at table picking the  \"merry-thought\" of a canvas-back duck, the memory of this thing comes  over him, and, burying his face in the costly napery, he gives himself  up to grief until kind words and a celery-glass-full of turpentine, or  something, bring back his buoyancy and rainbow smile. The hospitality  and generous treatment of our English brother to Americans now is  something beautiful, unaffected, and well worth a voyage across the  qualmy sea to see, but when Cockburn burned down the Capitol and took  the President's sugar-cured hams he did a rude act.          CHAPTER XXI.    THE ADVANCE OF THE REPUBLIC.      The administration now began to suffer at the hands of the people, many  of whom criticised the conduct of the war and that of the President  also. People met at Hartford and spoke so harshly that the Hartford  Federalist obtained a reputation which clung to him for many years.    There being no cable in those days, the peace by Treaty of Ghent was not  heard of in time to prevent the battle of New Orleans, January 8, 1815,  there having been two weeks of peace as a matter of fact when this hot  and fatal battle was fought.    General Pakenham, with a force of twelve thousand men by sea and land,  attacked the city."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145"],[0,"Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ (#20)"],[1,"the land, but which a  few--and they were always as rich in blood as in possessions--cherished  in its purity, that they might be more certainly distinguished  from Gentile peoples--the language in which the loved Rebekah  and Rachel sang to Benjamin.    The words appeared to set him thinking anew; after a while, however,  he caught the hand with which she fanned him, and said, \"Today, O my  mother, I have been made to think of many things that never had place  in my mind before. Tell me, first, what am I to be?\"    \"Have I not told you? You are to be my hero.\"    He could not see her face, yet he knew she was in play. He became  more serious.    \"You are very good, very kind, O my mother. No one will ever love  me as you do.\"    He kissed the hand over and over again.    \"I think I understand why you would have me put off the question,\"  he continued. \"Thus far my life has belonged to you. How gentle,  how sweet your control has been! I wish it could last forever.  But that may not be. It is the Lord's will that I shall one  day become owner of myself--a day of separation, and therefore a  dreadful day to you. Let us be brave and serious. I will be your  hero, but you must put me in the way. You know the law--every son  of Israel must have some occupation. I am not exempt, and ask now,  shall I tend the herds? or till the soil? or drive the saw? or be  a clerk or lawyer? What shall I be? Dear, good mother, help me to  an answer.\"    \"Gamaliel has been lecturing today,\" she said, thoughtfully.    \"If so, I did not hear him.\"    \"Then you have been walking with Simeon, who, they tell me,  inherits the genius of his family.\"    \"No, I have not seen him. I have been up on the Market-place,  not to the Temple. I visited the young Messala.\"    A certain change in his voice attracted the mother's attention.  A presentiment quickened the beating of her heart; the fan became  motionless again.    \"The Messala!\" she said. \"What could he say to so trouble you?\"    \"He is very much changed.\"    \"You mean he has come back a Roman.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Roman!\" she continued, half to herself. \"To all the world the  word means master. How long has he been away?\"    \"Five years.\"    She raised her head, and looked off into the night.    \"The airs of the Via Sacra are well enough in the streets of the  Egyptian and in Babylon; but in Jerusalem--our Jerusalem--the  covenant abides.\"    And, full of the thought, she settled back into her easy place.  He was first to speak.    \"What Messala said, my mother, was sharp enough in itself; but,  taken with the manner, some of the sayings were intolerable.\"    \"I think I understand you. Rome, her poets, orators, senators,  courtiers, are mad with affectation of what they call satire.\"    \"I suppose all great peoples are proud,\" he went on, scarcely  noticing the interruption; \"but the pride of that people is  unlike all others; in these latter days it is so grown the  gods barely escape it.\"    \"The gods escape!\" said the mother, quickly. \"More than one Roman  has accepted worship as his divine right.\"    \"Well, Messala always had his share of the disagreeable quality.  When he was a child, I have seen him mock strangers whom even Herod  condescended to receive with honors; yet he always spared Judea.  For the first time, in conversation with me to-day, he trifled  with our customs and God. As you would have had me do, I parted  with him finally. And now, O my dear mother, I would know with more  certainty if there be just ground for the Roman's contempt. In what  am I his inferior? Is ours a lower order of people? Why should I,  even in Caesar's presence; feel the shrinking of a slave? Tell me  especially why, if I have the soul, and so choose, I may not hunt  the honors of the world in all its fields? Why may not I take sword  and indulge the passion of war? As a poet, why may not I sing of all  themes? I can be a worker in metals, a keeper of flocks, a merchant,  why not an artist like the Greek? Tell me, O my mother--and this is  the sum of my trouble--why may not a son of Israel do all a Roman  may?\"    The reader will refer these questions back to the conversation in  the Market-place; the mother, listening with all her faculties  awake, from something which would have been lost upon one less  interested in him--from the connections of the subject, the pointing  of the questions, possibly his accent and tone--was not less swift  in making the same reference. She sat up, and in a voice quick and  sharp as his own, replied, \"I see, I see! From association Messala,  in boyhood, was almost a Jew; had he remained here, he might have  become a proselyte, so much do we all borrow from the influences  that ripen our lives; but the years in Rome have been too much for  him. I do not wonder at the change; yet\"--her voice fell--\"he might  have dealt tenderly at least with you. It is a hard, cruel nature  which in youth can forget its first loves.\"    Her hand dropped lightly upon his forehead, and the fingers caught  in his hair and lingered there lovingly, while her eyes sought  the highest stars in view. Her pride responded to his, not merely  in echo, but in the unison of perfect sympathy. She would answer  him; at the same time, not for the world would she have had the  answer unsatisfactory: an admission of inferiority might weaken  his spirit for life. She faltered with misgivings of her own powers.    \"What you propose, O my Judah, is not a subject for treatment by  a woman. Let me put its consideration off till to-morrow, and I  will have the wise Simeon--\"    \"Do not send me to the Rector,\" he said, abruptly.    \"I will have him come to us.\"    \"No, I seek more than information; while he might give me that  better than you, O my mother, you can do better by giving me  what he cannot--the resolution which is the soul of a man's soul.\"    She swept the heavens with a rapid glance, trying to compass all  the meaning of his questions.    \"While craving justice for ourselves, it is never wise to be  unjust to others. To deny valor in the enemy we have conquered is  to underrate our victory; and if the enemy be strong enough to hold  us at bay, much more to conquer us\"--she hesitated--\"self-respect  bids us seek some other explanation of our misfortunes than accusing  him of qualities inferior to our own.\"    Thus, speaking to herself rather than to him, she began:    \"Take heart, O my son. The Messala is nobly descended; his family  has been illustrious through many generations. In the days of  Republican Rome--how far back I cannot tell--they were famous,  some as soldiers, some as civilians. I can recall but one consul of  the name; their rank was senatorial, and their patronage always sought  because they were always rich. Yet if to-day your friend boasted  of his ancestry, you might have shamed him by recounting yours.  If he referred to the ages through which the line is traceable,  or to deeds, rank, or wealth--such allusions, except when great  occasion demands them, are tokens of small minds--if he mentioned  them in proof of his superiority, then without dread, and standing  on each particular, you might have challenged him to a comparison  of records.\"    Taking a moment's thought, the mother proceeded:    \"One of the ideas of fast hold now is that time has much to do with  the nobility of races and families. A Roman boasting his superiority  on that account over a son of Israel will always fail when put to  the proof. The founding of Rome was his beginning; the very best  of them cannot trace their descent beyond that period; few of them  pretend to do so; and of such as do, I say not one could make good  his claim except by resort to tradition. Messala certainly could  not. Let us look now to ourselves. Could we better?\"    A little more light would have enabled him to see the pride that  diffused itself over her face.    \"Let us imagine the Roman putting us to the challenge. I would  answer him, neither doubting nor boastful.\"    Her voice faltered; a tender thought changed the form of the argument.    \"Your father, O my Judah, is at rest with his fathers; yet I  remember, as though it were this evening, the day he and I,  with many rejoicing friends, went up into the Temple to present  you to the Lord. We sacrificed the doves, and to the priest I gave  your name, which he wrote in my presence--'Judah, son of Ithamar,  of the House of Hur.' The name was then carried away, and written  in a book of the division of records devoted to the saintly family.    \"I cannot tell you when the custom of registration in this mode  began. We know it prevailed before the flight from Egypt. I have  heard Hillel say Abraham caused the record to be first opened with  his own name, and the names of his sons, moved by the promises  of the Lord which separated him and them from all other races,  and made them the highest and noblest, the very chosen of the  earth. The covenant with Jacob was of like effect. 'In thy seed  shall all the nations of the earth be blessed'--so said the angel to  Abraham in the place Jehovah-jireh. 'And the land whereon thou liest,  to thee will I give it, and to thy seed'--so the Lord himself said  to Jacob asleep at Bethel on the way to Haran. Afterwards the wise  men looked forward to a just division of the land of promise; and,  that it might be known in the day of partition who were entitled  to portions, the Book of Generations was begun. But not for that  alone. The promise of a blessing to all the earth through the  patriarch reached far into the future. One name was mentioned in  connection with the blessing--the benefactor might be the humblest  of the chosen family, for the Lord our God knows no distinctions  of rank or riches. So, to make the performance clear to men of  the generation who were to witness it, and that they might give  the glory to whom it belonged, the record was required to be kept  with absolute certainty. Has it been so kept?\"    The"]]]
