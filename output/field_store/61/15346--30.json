They believe that illness is in many cases just as curable as the moral  diseases which they see daily cured around them, but that a great reform  is impossible till men learn to take a juster view of what physical  obliquity proceeds from.  Men will hide their illnesses as long as they  are scouted on its becoming known that they are ill; it is the scouting,  not the physic, which produces the concealment; and if a man felt that  the news of his being in ill-health would be received by his neighbours  as a deplorable fact, but one as much the result of necessary antecedent  causes as though he had broken into a jeweller's shop and stolen a  valuable diamond necklace--as a fact which might just as easily have  happened to themselves, only that they had the luck to be better born or  reared; and if they also felt that they would not be made more  uncomfortable in the prison than the protection of society against  infection and the proper treatment of their own disease actually  demanded, men would give themselves up to the police as readily on  perceiving that they had taken small-pox, as they go now to the  straightener when they feel that they are on the point of forging a will,  or running away with somebody else's wife.    But the main argument on which they rely is that of economy: for they  know that they will sooner gain their end by appealing to men's pockets,  in which they have generally something of their own, than to their heads,  which contain for the most part little but borrowed or stolen property;  and also, they believe it to be the readiest test and the one which has  most to show for itself.  If a course of conduct can be shown to cost a  country less, and this by no dishonourable saving and with no indirectly  increased expenditure in other ways, they hold that it requires a good  deal to upset the arguments in favour of its being adopted, and whether  rightly or wrongly I cannot pretend to say, they think that the more  medicinal and humane treatment of the diseased of which they are the  advocates would in the long run be much cheaper to the country: but I did  not gather that these reformers were opposed to meeting some of the more  violent forms of illness with the cat-of-nine-tails, or with death; for  they saw no so effectual way of checking them; they would therefore both  flog and hang, but they would do so pitifully.    I have perhaps dwelt too long upon opinions which can have no possible  bearing upon our own, but I have not said the tenth part of what these  would-be reformers urged upon me.  I feel, however, that I have  sufficiently trespassed upon the attention of the reader.          CHAPTER XIII: THE VIEWS OF THE EREWHONIANS CONCERNING DEATH      The Erewhonians regard death with less abhorrence than disease.  If it is  an offence at all, it is one beyond the reach of the law, which is  therefore silent on the subject; but they insist that the greater number  of those who are commonly said to die, have never yet been born--not, at  least, into that unseen world which is alone worthy of consideration.  As  regards this unseen world I understand them to say that some miscarry in  respect to it before they have even reached the seen, and some after,  while few are ever truly born into it at all--the greater part of all the  men and women over the whole country miscarrying before they reach it.  And they say that this does not matter so much as we think it does.    As for what we call death, they argue that too much has been made of it.  The mere knowledge that we shall one day die does not make us very  unhappy; no one thinks that he or she will escape, so that none are  disappointed.  We do not care greatly even though we know that we have  not long to live; the only thing that would seriously affect us would be  the knowing--or rather thinking that we know--the precise moment at which  the blow will fall.  Happily no one can ever certainly know this, though  many try to make themselves miserable by endeavouring to find it out.  It  seems as though there were some power somewhere which mercifully stays us  from putting that sting into the tail of death, which we would put there  if we could, and which ensures that though death must always be a  bugbear, it shall never under any conceivable circumstances be more than  a bugbear.    For even though a man is condemned to die in a week's time and is shut up  in a prison from which it is certain that he cannot escape, he will  always hope that a reprieve may come before the week is over.  Besides,  the prison may catch fire, and he may be suffocated not with a rope, but  with common ordinary smoke; or he may be struck dead by lightning while  exercising in the prison yards.  When the morning is come on which the  poor wretch is to be hanged, he may choke at his breakfast, or die from  failure of the heart's action before the drop has fallen; and even though  it has fallen, he cannot be quite certain that he is going to die, for he  cannot know this till his death has actually taken place, and it will be  too late then for him to discover that he was going to die at the  appointed hour after all.  The Erewhonians, therefore, hold that death,  like life, is an affair of being more frightened than hurt.    They burn their dead, and the ashes are presently scattered over any  piece of ground which the deceased may himself have chosen.  No one is  permitted to refuse this hospitality to the dead: people, therefore,  generally choose some garden or orchard which they may have known and  been fond of when they were young.  The superstitious hold that those  whose ashes are scattered over any land become its jealous guardians from  that time forward; and the living like to think that they shall become  identified with this or that locality where they have once been happy.    They do not put up monuments, nor write epitaphs, for their dead, though  in former ages their practice was much as ours, but they have a custom  which comes to much the same thing, for the instinct of preserving the  name alive after the death of the body seems to be common to all mankind.  They have statues of themselves made while they are still alive (those,  that is, who can afford it), and write inscriptions under them, which are  often quite as untruthful as are our own epitaphs--only in another way.  For they do not hesitate to describe themselves as victims to ill temper,  jealousy, covetousness, and the like, but almost always lay claim to  personal beauty, whether they have it or not, and, often, to the  possession of a large sum in the funded debt of the country.  If a person  is ugly he does not sit as a model for his own statue, although it bears  his name.  He gets the handsomest of his friends to sit for him, and one  of the ways of paying a compliment to another is to ask him to sit for  such a statue.  Women generally sit for their own statues, from a natural  disinclination to admit the superior beauty of a friend, but they expect  to be idealised.  I understood that the multitude of these statues was  beginning to be felt as an encumbrance in almost every family, and that  the custom would probably before long fall into desuetude.    Indeed, this has already come about to the satisfaction of every one, as  regards the statues of public men--not more than three of which can be  found in the whole capital.  I expressed my surprise at this, and was  told that some five hundred years before my visit, the city had been so  overrun with these pests, that there was no getting about, and people  were worried beyond endurance by having their attention called at every  touch and turn to something, which, when they had attended to it, they  found not to concern them.  Most of these statues were mere attempts to  do for some man or woman what an animal-stuffer does more successfully  for a dog, or bird, or pike.  They were generally foisted on the public  by some coterie that was trying to exalt itself in exalting some one  else, and not unfrequently they had no other inception than desire on the  part of some member of the coterie to find a job for a young sculptor to  whom his daughter was engaged.  Statues so begotten could never be  anything but deformities, and this is the way in which they are sure to  be begotten, as soon as the art of making them at all has become widely  practised.    I know not why, but all the noblest arts hold in perfection but for a  very little moment.  They soon reach a height from which they begin to  decline, and when they have begun to decline it is a pity that they  cannot be knocked on the head; for an art is like a living  organism--better dead than dying.  There is no way of making an aged art  young again; it must be born anew and grow up from infancy as a new  thing, working out its own salvation from effort to effort in all fear  and trembling.    The Erewhonians five hundred years ago understood nothing of all this--I  doubt whether they even do so now.  They wanted to get the nearest thing  they could to a stuffed man whose stuffing should not grow mouldy.  They  should have had some such an establishment as our Madame Tussaud's, where  the figures wear real clothes, and are painted up to nature.  Such an  institution might have been made self-supporting, for people might have  been made to pay before going in.  As it was, they had let their poor  cold grimy colourless heroes and heroines loaf about in squares and in  corners of streets in all weathers, without any attempt at artistic  sanitation--for there was no provision for burying their dead works of  art out of their sight--no drainage, so to speak, whereby statues that  had been sufficiently assimilated, so as to form part of the residuary  impression of the country, might be carried away out of the system.  Hence  they put them up with a light heart on the cackling of their coteries,  and they "]]]
