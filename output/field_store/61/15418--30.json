[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20470"],[0,"Etiquette (#20)"],[1,"mperative, a polite man has  no recourse but to step outside the curb and walk rapidly ahead,  returning to the sidewalk a few paces in advance.  A lady similarly  hurried may slip through a small space, if one offers, with an  apologetic \"I beg pardon.\"  But in no case should pushing be resorted  to.  It is very unmannerly for a party of loiterers to string  themselves thus across the width of a sidewalk, and then saunter  slowly, regardless of the fact that they are impeding the progress of  busier people.  A policeman should call their attention to the fact.    If the sidewalk is \"blocked\" by an orderly crowd, as it frequently is  on the occasion of parades and other public demonstrations, a man may  push his way through gently, saying, \"I beg pardon\" to those whom he is  compelled to jostle.  The fine breeding of a gentleman never shows more  conspicuously than in his manner of getting through a crowd.  The  beauty of it is, or, perhaps, I might say, the utility of it is, that  courtesy in such a case is very much more effective than \"bluff,\" for  the majority in an orderly crowd are inclined to be obliging, and  quickly respond to a good-humored request; whereas, if one aggressive  elbow begins to push, a hundred other elbows are set rigidly akimbo,  and the solid mass becomes ten-fold more unyielding than before.    If accosted by a stranger with a request for information as to streets,  directions, etc., one should kindly reply, and, if not able to give the  desired information, should, if possible, direct the stranger where to  make further inquiries.  Cheerful interest in the perplexities of a  bewildered sojourner in the city costs nothing and is always highly  appreciated.  Only a pessimist or a snob would dismiss such a question  curtly.    If a lady's dress has been torn, or trimming or braid ripped and left  trailing after contact with the nails in a packing-box on the sidewalk,  or from some similar accident, it is polite to call her attention to  the disaster.  A gentleman may do this with perfect propriety if he  sees that she is not aware of it.  He should preface the information  with \"Pardon me,\" and should lift his hat, as always when offering any  civility.    When attending to business at banks, post-office, railroad  ticket-offices, etc., one should pay no attention to other people,  further than to guard against allowing one's absorbing interest in  one's own affairs to make one regardless of the just rights of others  in the matter of \"turn\" at ticket or stamp windows, or in the use of  the public desk, pens, etc.--trifling tests of good manners that  distinguish the well-bred, _and which illustrate very pointedly the  truth that selfishness is always vulgar, and that an unfailing habit of  considering other people's comfort is a mark of gentle breeding_.    A lady should say \"Thank you\" to a gentleman who gives up a seat to her  in a street-car or other public conveyance, where, having _paid_ for a  seat, he has a _right_ to it, and his voluntary relinquishment of it is  a matter of _personal courtesy_ on his part.  The woman who slides into  a place thus offered without acknowledging the obligation is very  thoughtless, or else she has erroneous ideas of how far chivalry is  bound to be the slave of selfishness.  If the lady is accompanied by a  gentleman, he, too, should say \"Thank you,\" and lift his hat.  He  should also be thoughtful not to take the next vacated seat himself  without first offering it to the polite stranger.    A young woman, strong and well, may properly give up her seat to a  fragile woman, or a mother with a baby, or to an elderly man or woman.    Young ladies of leisure, who are not weary, should not be too ready to  \"oust\" tired clerks and laboring men whose ride home at six o'clock is  their first chance to sit down, for ten hours.  A _gentleman_ is  chivalrous; and there is a corresponsive quality in a _lady_, which  makes her delicately sensitive about unjustly imposing on that  chivalry, or which, in emergencies of sickness or disaster, enables  _her_ to be the _chivalrous in spirit_, and bear on her slender  shoulders the burden that is temporarily dropped when some stroke of  Providence lays the strong man low.    On the other hand, there are women of coarse fibre, who imagine that  they vastly increase their own importance by being selfishly exacting  in the matter of men's self-sacrificing attentions.  They may browbeat  the men who are in their power; but, outside of this narrow world of  their own, they are held in thorough contempt by the very men whose  admiration they had hoped to gain by their aggressive and ill-tempered  demands.    Men who smoke on the street should avoid the crowded promenade, where  ladies \"most do congregate;\" since it is nearly impossible to avoid  annoying some one with the smoke.    In most towns, the Board of Health ordinance forbidding spitting on  floors, sidewalks, etc., is not only a hygienic safe-guard, but a much  needed enforcement of good manners.  Comment is superfluous.    Based upon an idea borrowed from olden days--that the right arm, the  \"sword arm,\" should be free for defense--a custom formerly prevailed  for a man, walking with a lady, to place her always at his left side.  Then later--also with some idea of shielding her from danger--it was  the custom for a man to walk next to the curbstone, whether it happened  to be left or right.  This is still the rule, unless the sidewalk is  crowded; in which case a man walks at the side next the opposing  throng, in order to shield a lady from the elbows of the passers-by.    Authorities are divided on the subject of elevator etiquette, some  denouncing in round terms the man who is so rude as to keep his hat on  in an elevator where there are ladies; arguing that the elevator is a  \"little room,\" an \"interior,\" not a thoroughfare.  Others are equally  emphatic in asserting that the elevator _is_ a thoroughfare, _merely_;  and that hats are not to be removed, except under the same conditions  that would call for their removal in the street--as the greeting of  acquaintances, or the exchange of civilities.  The good sense of this  view is apparent.  A hat held in the hand in a crowded elevator is sure  to be in the way, and liable to be crushed.  A gentleman who wishes to  compromise between stolid ignoring of the ladies who are strangers, and  superfluous recognition of their presence, may lift his hat and replace  it immediately, when a lady enters the elevator, or when he enters an  elevator where ladies already are.  Such a courtesy differs from a  greeting in this: a stranger offering this elevator civility _does not  look at the lady_, nor does he bend his head; and his lifted hat is an  impersonal tribute to the sex.  A lady makes _no response_ to such a  courtesy; yet there is in her general bearing a subtle something, hard  to describe, but which every gentleman will readily recognize, that  shows whether or not she observes and appreciates his little act of  deference.  The atmosphere of good manners may be as invisible as the  air about us; but we know when we are breathing it.    During a promenade in the day-time, a lady does not take a man's arm  unless she is feeble from age or ill-health, and needs the support.  In  the evening, a gentleman walking with a lady may offer her his arm.  On  no account should a man take a woman's arm.  This is a disrespectful  freedom, that might be supposed to be the specialty of the rustic beau,  if it were not so frequently observed in city thoroughfares.    The \"cut direct\" is the rudest possible way of dropping an  acquaintance; and is allowable only in the case of some flagrant  offender who deserves public and merciless rebuke.  Ordinarily, the  result sought--of ending an undesired acquaintance--is attained by a  persistently cold courtesy, supplemented by as much avoidance as  possible; drifting apart, not sinking each other's craft without  warning.    As crowds are distracting, and people bent on their own errands are  often oblivious of their surroundings, it is quite possible for a  seeming cut to have been an unconscious oversight.  When an  acquaintance seems not to see one, though close at baud, it is possible  that something closer yet to his consciousness is absorbing all his  thoughts.  Only clear and unmistakable evidence of _intention_ should  lead one to infer a slight.  It is not only more _polite_, but more  _self-respecting_, to \"take offense\" _slowly_.          IN PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES    At the theatre or opera, at concerts, or popular lectures, at  \"commencements,\" and other prosperous and happy public entertainments,  a certain gayety of manner may be in harmony with the occasion; but it  should be under control, a smiling cheerfulness, not a free-and-easy  jollity.  Before the play, or the programme, begins, social  conversation is usually allowable in quiet tones that do not disturb  the surrounding people.  A gentle hum of lively voices is not an  unpleasant overture on such occasions.  But the moment the orchestra  begins, if at the theatre, or the instant that the meeting is called to  order by any initial feature of the programme, silence should fall upon  the assembly, and not a whisper be heard.  Polite attention should be  given to each feature of the hour.  Programmes should be folded and  arranged for easy reference before the exercises begin, so that no  rustling of papers shall mar the effect of the music, or interfere with  the speakers or listeners.  The noisy handling of programmes is a most  exasperating exhibition of thoughtlessness, and can easily be avoided  by a little caution.    It should be accounted a matter of good form not to be late in arriving  at the theatre, opera, etc.  People sometimes think that because their  seats are secured by their ticket-coupons, it makes no difference  whether they are in their places before the curtain rises or not.  But  it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20472"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School (#20)"],[1," long and a  yard high. A row of footlights across the miniature stage presently  blossomed into light, and the freshman girls smiled as they recognized  some of those same little bulbs that had served to illuminate the  pumpkin face of Miss Leece's effigy. The music ceased and the curtains  rolled back. There sat Cinderella by the kitchen fire, very stiff and  straight, but weeping audibly with her little fists in her eyes. She was  ten inches high and, on careful examination, it could be seen that two  threads attached to her arms, and another to the back of her neck, made  it possible for her to move about and use her hands in a remarkably  life-like manner.    Wild applause from the audience. Well there might be, for the scene was  perfect, from the old brick fireplace with an iron pot steaming on the  coals to the rows of shining pans and blue dishes on a shelf at the  side, all of which came from a toy shop, along with a little kitchen  bench and chairs.    The cruel sisters swept in, dressed for the ball. When they spoke there  were convulsive titters among the guests for the voices of the cruel  step-sisters were those of Nora and Hippy. Anne read the lines of  Cinderella so plaintively that Mrs. Gray shed a secret tear or two when  Cinderella was left alone in the gloomy old kitchen. When the fairy  godmother appeared, in a peaked red hat and a long red cape, it was  Jessica who spoke the lines in a sweet, musical voice. How Cinderella  rolled out the pumpkin and displayed six white mice in a trap, and how,  after a brief interval of total darkness, could be seen through the open  door a coach of gold in which sat Cinderella in a silken gown, need not  be related here. It all took place without a single slip and the dolls  went through their parts with such funny life-like motions that the boys  and girls forgot they were not watching real actors.    It was the scene of the ballroom, however, which was the real triumph of  the evening.    \"How did those clever children ever do it?\" exclaimed Mrs. Gray, aloud,  when the curtain rolled back and disclosed the ballroom of the palace,  with a drop curtain at the back showing a vista of marble columns and  pillars. A gilt chandelier was suspended in the middle, from which  stretched garlands of real smilax. There were rows of little gilt chairs  against the walls filled with dolls in stiff satins and brocades. And  one large throne chair with a red velvet cushion in it, on which sat the  prince, who spoke with the voice of David Nesbit, and entertained his  guests in royal state. After the exciting arrival of Cinderella, Nora  played a minuet on the mandolin, the tinkling music of which seemed best  suited to the doll drama, and the prince and Cinderella executed a dance  of such intricate steps and low bows that the audience was convulsed  with laughter. There were even suppressed titters from behind the  scenes. This dance, which had been devised by Tom Gray and Grace,  necessitated two extra threads to manipulate the feet. It was most  difficult and had required long and tedious practice, but the results  were quite worth all the time and trouble.    Mrs. Gray laughed till the tears rolled down her cheeks and made a  personal appeal for an encore, which was given; but there was a mishap  this time; Cinderella's threads became entangled and she came near to  breaking her china nose. Audiences are invariably most pitiless when  they are most pleased, and have no mercy on exhausted actors. At the cry  of \"Speech! Speech!\" the Prince stepped forward and made a low bow.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"we thank you for your approval and if  strength and breath permitted us, and the lady had not injured her nose,  we would gladly dance again for you.\"    Then came the last scene. The step-sisters made desperate efforts to  wear the slipper; Cinderella finally retired triumphantly on the  prince's arm, and the curtains closed only to open again a few moments  later upon a scene which bore a strong resemblance to Oakdale High  School. The fairy godmother occupied the center of the stage while the  entire company of dolls were lined up on either side. Cinderella and the  prince, each held the end of an open scroll, which bore a printed  inscription that could be seen by the audience. It read:    \"A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO THE FAIRY GODMOTHER OF THE FRESHMAN CLASS.\"    A scene of wild enthusiasm followed. The young people gave three cheers  for Mrs. Gray and ended with the High School yell. The actors came out  and were cheered each in turn.    Grace, Tom Gray and Reddy had worked the marionettes, it seemed,  standing on the back of the table where the theater was placed, while  the others, sitting on low stools at the sides where they could see and  not be seen, read their lines which had been composed by Anne.    \"It wasn't so hard as you might think,\" said Grace, explaining the  marionettes to a group of friends. \"Dressing the dolls was easy; we  glued on most of their clothes, and we made the step-sisters ugly by  giving them putty noses. Hippy painted the scenery and David supplied  the electric lights. The threads that moved the arms and bodies were  tied to little cross sticks something like a gallows, so that they could  be held from above without being seen.\"    But the marionette show was only the beginning of the party. There was  to be feasting and dancing, and, lastly, a big Christmas tree loaded  with presents.    The floors were cleared. The notes of a waltz rang out, and away whirled  the happy boys and girls. Anne and David, who did not dance, retired to  a sofa in the library to look on.    \"Are you happy, Anne, in your beautiful pink dress?\" asked David,  regarding her with open admiration.    \"How can I help being happy?\" she replied. \"This is the first pretty  dress that I have ever had and I never went to a party before, either.\"    \"I never enjoyed a party before,\" said David, \"but I'm enjoying this  one. I hope, for Mrs. Gray's sake, it goes off without a hitch.\"    Just then Tom Gray waltzed by with Grace. They stopped when they saw  their friends, and came back.    \"Our efforts are certainly crowned with success,\" exclaimed Grace. \"It's  the most beautiful ball ever given in Oakdale. Everyone says so. By the  way,\" she added, \"get your partners and fall in line for the grand march  to supper.\"    \"I already have mine, all right,\" declared Tom Gray.    \"And I think I have mine,\" observed David. \"She's wearing a pink dress  and is just about as tall as a marionette.\"    Anne laughed and stood on tiptoe to make herself look taller. Suddenly  she caught the eye of Miriam Nesbit, who was lingering in the doorway,  watching the scene with an expression that the circumstances and holiday  surroundings hardly seemed to justify.    \"I wonder if the party will go off without a hitch,\" thought Anne, as  they joined the grand march into the dining room.    When the beautiful, illuminated tree had been disburdened of all its  presents and the guests were well advanced on their supper, Mrs. Gray  approached Anne, carrying an oblong box, neatly done up in white tissue  paper tied with red ribbons. Pinned to the ribbon with a piece of holly  was a Christmas card on which was printed in fancy lettering \"A  Christmas Thought.\"    \"Why, what is this, Mrs. Gray?\" demanded Anne, rather excited, while  many of the boys and girls gathered around her and some stood on chairs  in order to see what the mysterious box contained.    \"I know no more than you, dear,\" replied the old lady. \"A man left it at  the door a moment ago, and one of the servants gave it to me. Why don't  you open it and see?\"    Anne hesitated. Something told her not to open the box, but how could  she help it with dozens of her friends waiting eagerly to see what was  in it?    \"Hurry up, Anne, aren't you curious to see what it is?\" some one called.    \"It looks like flowers,\" said another.    \"Or candy,\" observed a third.    And still Anne's fingers lingered on the bow of red ribbon. Was there  anyone in the world who could be sending her a box that night? Certainly  not her mother nor her sister, nor any of her friends who had exchanged  presents in the morning. Mrs. Gray evidently had not sent it and there  was no one else in her small list of friends who would have taken the  trouble.    \"Anne, you funny child, don't you see we are all waiting impatiently?\"  said Grace at last.    Anne slipped off the ribbons and opened the package. In the box was some  object, carefully done up in more tissue paper.    \"It looks like a mummy,\" exclaimed Hippy.    Untying the wrappers, Anne held up to the curious view of the others a  large doll.    At first she hardly comprehended what it was and held it out at arms'  length looking at it wonderingly. It was dressed as a man in a black  suit with a long Prince Albert coat, very crudely made on close  inspection, but still cut and fitted to give the right effect. The face  had been cleverly changed with paint and putty, and pinned on the head  was a black felt hat, constructed out of the crown of an old one  evidently, in which had been sewn some lank black hair.    A card was tied around the doll's neck, and some one looking over Anne's  shoulder read aloud the following inscription written upon it:    \"Why have imitation actors when you can get real ones?\"    Anne gave a gasp.    Who could have played this cruel trick upon her? She knew her four  friends had never spoken of the happenings of Thanksgiving night, but  such secrets would leak out in spite of everything, and there may have  been others in the audience who had recognized her. Moreover, her father  himself would not have hesitated to tell who she was, so that it was not  difficult to understand how the story had spread.    But who would have the heart to hold her father up to ridicule in this  way, and to cause her such secret pain and unhappiness? While her  thoughts were busy, David"]]]
