Many of them,  conscious of their misconduct, doubtless felt secret misgivings whenever  any specially significant outburst of popular dissatisfaction occurred.  But for many years they were able to present a united and brazen front,  and to crush anyone who dared to so much as wag a finger against them.  It was intimated on a former page that Robert Gourlay was not the first  victim of Executive tyranny. The first conspicuous victim of whom any  record has been preserved was Mr. Robert Thorpe, an English barrister of  much learning and acumen, who in 1805 was appointed a puisne judge of  the Court of King's Bench for Upper Canada. Previous to his arrival in  this country Mr. Thorpe had never been remarkable for any specially  liberal opinions, but he was a man of enlightened mind, and actuated by  an honest desire to do his duty. He was not long in perceiving that the  administration of justice in this Province was little better than a  hollow mockery. He resolved to do what one man could to restore public  confidence in the judicial bench, and his court erelong became a popular  forum for honest litigants, for it was evident to all that he held the  scales of justice with an even hand, and was not to be either cajoled or  bullied into perverting the law. Before he had been a twelvemonth in the  country he was known far and wide as an upright judge, and as a sort of  champion of popular rights. Grand juries took him into their confidence,  and tabulated their grievances before him. These were laid by him  before the authorities at York, upon his return from circuit; a  proceeding which was quite sufficient to bring down upon his head  the opposition of the faction which flourished by reason of those very  grievances. The whole of the Family Compact influence arrayed itself  against him in deadly enmity. Francis Gore arrived in the capacity of  Lieutenant-Governor in the summer of 1806. He was informed by his  Councillors that Judge Thorpe was a dangerous and revolutionary  personage. It was certain that the past year had been signalized by a  decided propensity on the part of the people to assert themselves  against the intolerable exactions of their oppressors, and that a spirit  of opposition was on the increase throughout the land. Governor Gore and  his Councillors reversed the inductive process, and attributed the  popular discontent to the influence of the new judge. This seeming  conviction on their parts was strengthened by certain remarks of Judge  Thorpe himself, made in reply to an address from the Grand Jury of the  London District. \"The art of governing,\" said he, \"is a difficult  science. Knowledge is not instinctive, and the days of inspiration have  passed away. Therefore, when there was neither talent, education,  information, nor even manners in the Administration, little could be  expected, and nothing was produced.\" The reference here is manifestly to  the _regime_ of Governor Hunter and Commodore Grant; and the intimation  is that better things are to be hoped for under the recently-arrived  Governor. \"But,\" continued the judge, \"there is an ultimate point of  depression, as well as of exaltation, from whence all human affairs  naturally advance or recede. Therefore, proportionate to your  depression, we may expect your progress in prosperity will advance with  accelerated velocity.\" He also in the course of his address, inveighed  against the Alien Act of 1804. When he reached York, at the close of the  circuit, he laid before the new Lieutenant-Governor the various  recapitulations of grievances which had been entrusted to him. They were  received by Mr. Gore and his Councillors with a very ill grace. The  complaints from the London District were stated with great vigour and  lucidity, and as they had got into print they could not be suppressed or  wholly ignored. An attempt was made to show that the chapter of  grievances had been presented by the jurors, not because there was  really anything of importance to complain of, but because Judge Thorpe  himself had instigated them to such a course. As this charge was openly  made, Mr. Thorpe in his capacity of a Justice of the King's Bench,  caused a proceeding of the nature of _scandalum magnatum_ to be  instituted. His brother judges, however, some of whom were members of  the Executive Council, and all of whom were subject to strong influences  from that quarter, ruled that the proceeding could not be maintained,  and it accordingly fell through. An attempt was also made, first to  intimidate, and afterwards to corrupt the Grand Jury. A letter was sent  to them from the office of the Lieutenant-Governor, requesting them to  state the grounds of their complaints more specifically. The recipients  responded by preparing and forwarding a stronger case than before. A  recantation was then drawn up by a skilful hand, and presented to each  individual member of the Jury, a reward being at the same time offered  as an inducement to sign it. The jurymen, however, were not prepared to  barter away their liberties in this manner, and the attempt wholly  failed. While the Executive were deliberating as to how they could most  effectually strike Judge Thorpe, a vacancy occurred in the  representation of one of the constituencies in the Home District. In  those times, as has already been seen, a judgeship was no  disqualification for political life, and a deputation waited on Mr.  Thorpe with a numerously signed address, requesting him to become their  representative. He replied that he would not become a partisan, but that  if he were returned to Parliament he would not hesitate to do his duty.  No sooner did it become known that \"the Radical Judge,\" as he was  called, was a candidate for the Assembly than the leading spirits of the  Compact aroused themselves to defeat him. This was natural enough. That  they should employ against him every means which their ingenuity could  devise--among others, bribery, vilification and deliberate slander--that  also was natural, when the time and persons are considered. \"Every  engine within the reach of authority,\" writes Mr. Jackson, \"was used for  the purpose of defeating the wishes of the people on this occasion. All  interests were required to yield in favour of the candidate most likely  to succeed as against Mr. Thorpe. Any person in employment, in  expectation of, or entitled to land, was gratified, promised, or  threatened; magistrates were made and unmade, as best suited the  purposes of electioneering; grants were given; fees excused, or promised  to be paid by those high in authority. Even domestics were bribed with  places, land, and money, to vilify and accuse, by direct falsehoods, the  most upright, serviceable and esteemed persons in the Province.\" For  once public opinion proved too strong for Family Compact influence.  Judge Thorpe was returned, and great things were hoped for from his  career in Parliament. But the triumph of freedom was short-lived. The  Compact was too strong to be opposed by the multitude with impunity.  Lieutenant-Governor Gore was subservient to its wishes, and besides he  had by this time come to hate the popular judge on his own account, and  his mind was fully made up to solicit from the Colonial Secretary Judge  Thorpe's recall. One of his private letters, written from Kingston,  during a journey from York to Montreal, several months after the Judge's  election to the Assembly, announces this resolution in unmistakable  terms. \"The object of Mr. T.'s [Thorpe's] emissions,\" he writes,  \"appears to be to persuade the people to turn every gentleman out of the  House of Assembly. However, keep your temper with the rascals, I beseech  you. I shall represent everything at St. James'.\" He was as good as his  word, and in October, 1807, the announcement was made in the _Gazette_  that the Lieutenant-Governor had been instructed to suspend Mr. Thorpe  from his judgeship, which we may be quite sure was done without  unnecessary loss of time.    Thus did might continue to triumph over right. There was not the  slightest imputation of any sort against the Judge's character. His  professional attainments were high; his personal character without a  stain. His continued presence in Canada would have been a blessing to  all but the race of tyrants who trampled on popular liberty. Yet he was  removed because he respected himself and his office too highly to  pervert judgment, and because he bade fair to abridge the rule of  corruption. Upon his return to England the Colonial Office urged nothing  whatever against him, and merely suggested, by way of justification for  his recall, that his stay in Upper Canada would have led to perpetual  disturbance of the public tranquillity. He instituted proceedings in one  of the English courts against Mr. Gore, who was convicted of libel, but  who escaped much more easily than he deserved with a fine of trifling  amount. By way of recompense for his recall from Upper Canada, Judge  Thorpe was appointed Chief Justice of Sierra Leone. There he remained  for two years, by which time his constitution had become so much broken  by the climate that he was compelled to return home. At the request of a  number of the inhabitants he carried with him to England a petition  complaining of certain abuses of power there. For this he was discarded  by the Ministry of the day. His appointment as Chief Justice was  cancelled, and another judge was sent out to West Africa in his stead.  The rest of his life was passed in obscurity and neglect, and when he  died his family were left without any provision for their future. Such  was the untoward fate of an honourable and high-minded man, whose only  fault was that he was too pure for the times in which he lived, and for  the people among whom his lot was cast.    Another early victim, whose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],[0,"The Book-Hunter (#20)"],[1,"than upon the external conditions of their library,  such as those who affect science, or the classics, or English poetic and  historical literature. There was no way of defining his peculiar walk  save by his own name--it was the Fitzpatrick-Smart walk. In fact, it  wound itself in infinite windings through isolated spots of literary  scenery, if we may so speak, in which he took a personal interest. There  were historical events, bits of family history, chiefly of a tragic or a  scandalous kind,--efforts of art or of literary genius on which, through  some hidden intellectual law, his mind and memory loved to dwell; and it  was in reference to these that he collected. If the book were the one  desired by him, no anxiety and toil, no payable price, was to be grudged  for its acquisition. If the book were an inch out of his own line, it  might be trampled in the mire for aught he cared, be it as rare or  costly as it could be.    It was difficult, almost impossible, for others to predicate what would  please this wayward sort of taste, and he was the torment of the  book-caterers, who were sure of a princely price for the right article,  but might have the wrong one thrown in their teeth with contumely. It  was a perilous, but, if successful, a gratifying thing to present him  with a book. If it happened to hit his fancy, he felt the full force of  the compliment, and overwhelmed the giver with his courtly thanks. But  great observation and tact were required for such an adventure. The  chances against an ordinary thoughtless gift-maker were thousands to  one; and those who were acquainted with his strange nervous temperament,  knew that the existence within his dwelling-place of any book not of his  own special kind, would impart to him the sort of feeling of uneasy  horror which a bee is said to feel when an earwig comes into its cell.  Presentation copies by authors were among the chronic torments of his  existence. While the complacent author was perhaps pluming himself on  his liberality in making the judicious gift, the recipient was pouring  out all his sarcasm, which was not feeble or slight, on the odious  object, and wondering why an author could have entertained against him  so steady and enduring a malice as to take the trouble of writing and  printing all that rubbish with no better object than disturbing the  peace of mind of an inoffensive old man. Every tribute from such _dona  ferentes_ cost him much uneasiness and some want of sleep--for what  could he do with it? It was impossible to make merchandise of it, for he  was every inch a gentleman. He could not burn it, for under an acrid  exterior he had a kindly nature. It was believed, indeed, that he had  established some limbo of his own, in which such unwelcome commodities  were subject to a kind of burial or entombment, where they remained in  existence, yet were decidedly outside the circle of his household gods.    These gods were a pantheon of a lively and grotesque aspect, for he was  a hunter after other things besides books. His acquisitions included  pictures, and the various commodities which, for want of a distinctive  name, auctioneers call \"miscellaneous articles of vertu.\" He started on  his accumulating career with some old family relics, and these, perhaps,  gave the direction to his subsequent acquisitions, for they were all,  like his books, brought together after some self-willed and peculiar law  of association that pleased himself. A bad, even an inferior, picture he  would not have--for his taste was exquisite--unless, indeed, it had some  strange history about it, adapting it to his wayward fancies, and then  he would adopt the badness as a peculiar recommendation, and point it  out with some pungent and appropriate remark to his friends. But though,  with these peculiar exceptions, his works of art were faultless, no  dealer could ever calculate on his buying a picture, however high in  artistic merit or tempting as a bargain. With his ever-accumulating  collection, in which tiny sculpture and brilliant colour predominated,  he kept a sort of fairy world around him. But each one of the mob of  curious things he preserved had some story linking it with others, or  with his peculiar fancies, and each one had its precise place in a sort  of _epos_, as certainly as each of the persons in the confusion of a  pantomime or a farce has his own position and functions.    After all, he was himself his own greatest curiosity. He had come to  manhood just after the period of gold-laced waistcoats, small-clothes,  and shoe-buckles, otherwise he would have been long a living memorial of  these now antique habits. It happened to be his lot to preserve down to  us the earliest phase of the pantaloon dynasty. So, while the rest of  the world were booted or heavy shod, his silk-stockinged feet were  thrust into pumps of early Oxford cut, and the predominant garment was  the surtout, blue in colour, and of the original make before it came to  be called a frock. Round his neck was wrapped an ante-Brummelite  neckerchief (not a tie), which projected in many wreaths like a great  poultice--and so he took his walks abroad, a figure which he could  himself have turned into admirable ridicule.    One of the mysteries about him was, that his clothes, though unlike any  other person's, were always old. This characteristic could not even be  accounted for by the supposition that he had laid in a sixty years'  stock in his youth, for they always appeared to have been a good deal  worn. The very umbrella was in keeping--it was of green silk, an  obsolete colour ten years ago--and the handle was of a peculiar  crosier-like formation in cast-horn, obviously not obtainable in the  market. His face was ruddy, but not with the ruddiness of youth; and,  bearing on his head a Brutus wig of the light-brown hair which had long  ago legitimately shaded his brow, when he stood still--except for his  linen, which was snowy white--one might suppose that he had been shot  and stuffed on his return home from college, and had been sprinkled with  the frowzy mouldiness which time imparts to stuffed animals and other  things, in which a semblance to the freshness of living nature is vainly  attempted to be preserved. So if he were motionless; but let him speak,  and the internal freshness was still there, an ever-blooming garden of  intellectual flowers. His antiquated costume was no longer grotesque--it  harmonised with an antiquated courtesy and high-bred gentleness of  manner, which he had acquired from the best sources, since he had seen  the first company in his day, whether for rank or genius. And  conversation and manner were far from exhausting his resources. He had a  wonderful pencil--it was potent for the beautiful, the terrible, and the  ridiculous; but it took a wayward wilful course, like everything else  about him. He had a brilliant pen, too, when he chose to wield it; but  the idea that he should exercise any of these his gifts in common  display before the world, for any even of the higher motives that make  people desire fame and praise, would have sickened him. His faculties  were his own as much as his collection, and to be used according to his  caprice and pleasure. So fluttered through existence one who, had it  been his fate to have his own bread to make, might have been a great  man. Alas for the end! Some curious annotations are all that remain of  his literary powers--some drawings and etchings in private collections  all of his artistic. His collection, with its long train of legends and  associations, came to what he himself must have counted as dispersal. He  left it to his housekeeper, who, like a wise woman, converted it into  cash while its mysterious reputation was fresh. Huddled in a great  auction-room, its several catalogued items lay in humiliating contrast  with the decorous order in which they were wont to be arranged. _Sic  transit gloria mundi._    Let us now call up a different and a more commonplace type of the  book-hunter--it shall be Inchrule Brewer. He is guiltless of all  intermeddling with the contents of books, but in their external  attributes his learning is marvellous. He derived his nickname, from the  practice of keeping, as his inseparable pocket-companion, one of those  graduated folding measures of length which may often be seen protruding  from the moleskin pocket of the joiner. He used it at auctions and on  other appropriate occasions, to measure the different elements of a  book--the letterpress--the unprinted margin--the external expanse of the  binding; for to the perfectly scientific collector all these things are  very significant.[26] They are, in fact, on record among the craft, like  the pedigrees and physical characteristics recorded in stud-books and  short-horn books. One so accomplished in this kind of analysis could  tell at once, by this criterion, whether the treasure under the hammer  was the same that had been knocked down before at the Roxburghe  sale--the Askew, the Gordonstoun, or the Heber, perhaps--or was  veritably an impostor--or was in reality a new and previously unknown  prize well worth contending for. The minuteness and precision of his  knowledge excited wonder, and, being anomalous in the male sex even  among collectors, gave occasion to a rumour that its possessor must  veritably be an aged maiden in disguise.    [Footnote 26: Of the copy of the celebrated 1635 Elzevir Caesar, in the  Imperial Library at Paris, Brunet triumphantly informs us that it is  four inches and ten-twelfths in height, and occupies the high position  of being the tallest copy of that volume in the world, since other  illustrious copies put in competition with it have been found not to  exceed four inches and eight, or, at the utmost, nine, twelfths.    \"Ces details,\" he subjoins, \"paroitront sans doute puerils a bien des  gens: mais puisque c'est la grandeur des marges de ces sorts de"]]]
