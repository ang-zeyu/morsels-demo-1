I am  well aware that what I have now written will by some be branded as false  and malicious. It will be denied, not only that such a thing ever did  transpire, as I have now narrated, but that such a thing could happen in  _Maryland_. I can only say--believe it or not--that I have said nothing  but the literal truth, gainsay it who may.    I speak advisedly when I say this,--that killing a slave, or any colored  person, in Talbot county, Maryland, is not treated as a crime, either by  the courts or the community. Mr. Thomas Lanman, ship carpenter, of St.  Michael's, killed two slaves, one of whom he butchered with a hatchet,  by knocking his brains out. He used to boast of the commission of the  awful and bloody deed. I have heard him do so, laughingly, saying, among  other things, that he was the only benefactor of his country in the  company, and that when \"others would do as much as he had done, we  should be relieved of the d--d niggers.\"    As an evidence of the reckless disregard of human life where the life  is that of a slave I may state the notorious fact, that the{98} wife of  Mr. Giles Hicks, who lived but a short distance from Col. Lloyd's, with  her own hands murdered my wife's cousin, a young girl between fifteen  and sixteen years of age--mutilating her person in a most shocking  manner. The atrocious woman, in the paroxysm of her wrath, not content  with murdering her victim, literally mangled her face, and broke her  breast bone. Wild, however, and infuriated as she was, she took the  precaution to cause the slave-girl to be buried; but the facts of the  case coming abroad, very speedily led to the disinterment of the remains  of the murdered slave-girl. A coroner's jury was assembled, who  decided that the girl had come to her death by severe beating. It was  ascertained that the offense for which this girl was thus hurried out of  the world, was this: she had been set that night, and several preceding  nights, to mind Mrs. Hicks's baby, and having fallen into a sound sleep,  the baby cried, waking Mrs. Hicks, but not the slave-girl. Mrs. Hicks,  becoming infuriated at the girl's tardiness, after calling several  times, jumped from her bed and seized a piece of fire-wood from the  fireplace; and then, as she lay fast asleep, she deliberately pounded in  her skull and breast-bone, and thus ended her life. I will not say that  this most horrid murder produced no sensation in the community. It _did_  produce a sensation; but, incredible to tell, the moral sense of the  community was blunted too entirely by the ordinary nature of slavery  horrors, to bring the murderess to punishment. A warrant was issued  for her arrest, but, for some reason or other, that warrant was never  served. Thus did Mrs. Hicks not only escape condign punishment, but even  the pain and mortification of being arraigned before a court of justice.    Whilst I am detailing the bloody deeds that took place during my stay  on Col. Lloyd's plantation, I will briefly narrate another dark  transaction, which occurred about the same time as the murder of Denby  by Mr. Gore.    On the side of the river Wye, opposite from Col. Lloyd's, there lived  a Mr. Beal Bondley, a wealthy slaveholder. In the direction{99} of his  land, and near the shore, there was an excellent oyster fishing ground,  and to this, some of the slaves of Col. Lloyd occasionally resorted in  their little canoes, at night, with a view to make up the deficiency of  their scanty allowance of food, by the oysters that they could easily  get there. This, Mr. Bondley took it into his head to regard as a  trespass, and while an old man belonging to Col. Lloyd was engaged in  catching a few of the many millions of oysters that lined the bottom of  that creek, to satisfy his hunger, the villainous Mr. Bondley, lying in  ambush, without the slightest ceremony, discharged the contents of his  musket into the back and shoulders of the poor old man. As good fortune  would have it, the shot did not prove mortal, and Mr. Bondley came over,  the next day, to see Col. Lloyd--whether to pay him for his property,  or to justify himself for what he had done, I know not; but this I _can_  say, the cruel and dastardly transaction was speedily hushed up; there  was very little said about it at all, and nothing was publicly done  which looked like the application of the principle of justice to the  man whom _chance_, only, saved from being an actual murderer. One of  the commonest sayings to which my ears early became accustomed, on Col.  Lloyd's plantation and elsewhere in Maryland, was, that it was _\"worth  but half a cent to kill a nigger, and a half a cent to bury him;\"_ and  the facts of my experience go far to justify the practical truth of this  strange proverb. Laws for the protection of the lives of the slaves,  are, as they must needs be, utterly incapable of being enforced, where  the very parties who are nominally protected, are not permitted to give  evidence, in courts of law, against the only class of persons from whom  abuse, outrage and murder might be reasonably apprehended. While I heard  of numerous murders committed by slaveholders on the Eastern Shores of  Maryland, I never knew a solitary instance in which a slaveholder was  either hung or imprisoned for having murdered a slave. The usual pretext  for killing a slave is, that the slave has offered resistance. Should  a slave, when assaulted, but raise his hand in self defense, the white  assaulting{100} party is fully justified by southern, or Maryland,  public opinion, in shooting the slave down. Sometimes this is done,  simply because it is alleged that the slave has been saucy. But here I  leave this phase of the society of my early childhood, and will relieve  the kind reader of these heart-sickening details.

SOPHIA  AULD--LITTLE TOMMY--MY NEW POSITION--MY NEW DUTIES--A TURNING POINT IN  MY HISTORY.      I have nothing cruel or shocking to relate of my own personal  experience, while I remained on Col. Lloyd's plantation, at the home of  my old master. An occasional cuff from Aunt Katy, and a regular whipping  from old master, such as any heedless and mischievous boy might get from  his father, is all that I can mention of this sort. I was not old enough  to work in the field, and, there being little else than field work to  perform, I had much leisure. The most I had to do, was, to drive up the  cows in the evening, to keep the front yard clean, and to perform  small errands for my young mistress, Lucretia Auld. I have reasons for  thinking this lady was very kindly disposed toward me, and, although I  was not often the object of her attention, I constantly regarded her  as my friend, and was always glad when it was my privilege to do her a  service. In a family where there was so much that was harsh, cold and  indifferent, the slightest word or look of kindness passed, with me, for  its full value. Miss Lucretia--as{102} we all continued to call her long  after her marriage--had bestowed upon me such words and looks as taught  me that she pitied me, if she did not love me. In addition to words and  looks, she sometimes gave me a piece of bread and butter; a thing not  set down in the bill of fare, and which must have been an extra ration,  planned aside from either Aunt Katy or old master, solely out of the  tender regard and friendship she had for me. Then, too, I one day got  into the wars with Uncle Able's son, \"Ike,\" and had got sadly worsted;  in fact, the little rascal had struck me directly in the forehead with a  sharp piece of cinder, fused with iron, from the old blacksmith's forge,  which made a cross in my forehead very plainly to be seen now. The gash  bled very freely, and I roared very loudly and betook myself home.  The coldhearted Aunt Katy paid no attention either to my wound or my  roaring, except to tell me it served me right; I had no business  with Ike; it was good for me; I would now keep away _\"from dem Lloyd  niggers.\"_ Miss Lucretia, in this state of the case, came forward;  and, in quite a different spirit from that manifested by Aunt Katy, she  called me into the parlor (an extra privilege of itself) and, without  using toward me any of the hard-hearted and reproachful epithets of my  kitchen tormentor, she quietly acted the good Samaritan. With her own  soft hand she washed the blood from my head and face, fetched her own  balsam bottle, and with the balsam wetted a nice piece of white linen,  and bound up my head. The balsam was not more healing to the wound in my  head, than her kindness was healing to the wounds in my spirit, made  by the unfeeling words of Aunt Katy. After this, Miss Lucretia was my  friend. I felt her to be such; and I have no doubt that the simple act  of binding up my head, did much to awaken in her mind an interest in my  welfare. It is quite true, that this interest was never very marked, and  it seldom showed itself in anything more than in giving me a piece  of bread when I was hungry; but this was a great favor on a slave  plantation, and I was the only one of the children to whom such  attention was paid.{103} When very hungry, I would go into the back yard  and play under Miss Lucretia's window. When pretty severely pinched by  hunger, I had a habit of singing, which the good lady very soon came to  understand as a petition for a piece of bread.

Stone vessels were much in evidence as well as ornaments of gold  and the skins of many animals, but nowhere did he see an indication of  any woven fabric, indicating that in that respect at least the Ho-don  were still low in the scale of evolution, and yet the proportions and  symmetry of the corridors and apartments bespoke a degree of  civilization.    The way led through several apartments and long corridors, up at least  three flights of stone stairs and finally out upon a ledge upon the  western side of the building overlooking the blue lake. Along this  ledge, or arcade, his guide led him for a hundred yards, to stop at  last before a wide entrance-way leading into another apartment of the  palace.    Here Tarzan beheld a considerable concourse of warriors in an enormous  apartment, the domed ceiling of which was fully fifty feet above the  floor. Almost filling the chamber was a great pyramid ascending in  broad steps well up under the dome in which were a number of round  apertures which let in the light. The steps of the pyramid were  occupied by warriors to the very pinnacle, upon which sat a large,  imposing figure of a man whose golden trappings shone brightly in the  light of the afternoon sun, a shaft of which poured through one of the  tiny apertures of the dome.    \"Ko-tan!\" cried Dak-lot, addressing the resplendent figure at the  pinnacle of the pyramid. \"Ko-tan and warriors of Pal-ul-don! Behold the  honor that Jad-ben-Otho has done you in sending as his messenger his  own son,\" and Dak-lot, stepping aside, indicated Tarzan with a dramatic  sweep of his hand.    Ko-tan rose to his feet and every warrior within sight craned his neck  to have a better view of the newcomer. Those upon the opposite side of  the pyramid crowded to the front as the words of the old warrior  reached them. Skeptical were the expressions on most of the faces; but  theirs was a skepticism marked with caution. No matter which way  fortune jumped they wished to be upon the right side of the fence. For  a moment all eyes were centered upon Tarzan and then gradually they  drifted to Ko-tan, for from his attitude would they receive the cue  that would determine theirs. But Ko-tan was evidently in the same  quandary as they--the very attitude of his body indicated it--it was  one of indecision and of doubt.    The ape-man stood erect, his arms folded upon his broad breast, an  expression of haughty disdain upon his handsome face; but to Dak-lot  there seemed to be indications also of growing anger. The situation was  becoming strained. Dak-lot fidgeted, casting apprehensive glances at  Tarzan and appealing ones at Ko-tan. The silence of the tomb wrapped  the great chamber of the throneroom of Pal-ul-don.    At last Ko-tan spoke. \"Who says that he is Dor-ul-Otho?\" he asked,  casting a terrible look at Dak-lot.    \"He does!\" almost shouted that terrified noble.    \"And so it must be true?\" queried Ko-tan.    Could it be that there was a trace of irony in the chief's tone? Otho  forbid! Dak-lot cast a side glance at Tarzan--a glance that he intended  should carry the assurance of his own faith; but that succeeded only in  impressing the ape-man with the other's pitiable terror.    \"O Ko-tan!\" pleaded Dak-lot, \"your own eyes must convince you that  indeed he is the son of Otho. Behold his godlike figure, his hands, and  his feet, that are not as ours, and that he is entirely tailless as is  his mighty father.\"    Ko-tan appeared to be perceiving these facts for the first time and  there was an indication that his skepticism was faltering. At that  moment a young warrior who had pushed his way forward from the opposite  side of the pyramid to where he could obtain a good look at Tarzan  raised his voice.    \"Ko-tan,\" he cried, \"it must be even as Dak-lot says, for I am sure now  that I have seen Dor-ul-Otho before. Yesterday as we were returning  with the Kor-ul-lul prisoners we beheld him seated upon the back of a  great GRYF. We hid in the woods before he came too near, but I saw  enough to make sure that he who rode upon the great beast was none  other than the messenger who stands here now.\"    This evidence seemed to be quite enough to convince the majority of the  warriors that they indeed stood in the presence of deity--their faces  showed it only too plainly, and a sudden modesty that caused them to  shrink behind their neighbors. As their neighbors were attempting to do  the same thing, the result was a sudden melting away of those who stood  nearest the ape-man, until the steps of the pyramid directly before him  lay vacant to the very apex and to Ko-tan. The latter, possibly  influenced as much by the fearful attitude of his followers as by the  evidence adduced, now altered his tone and his manner in such a degree  as might comport with the requirements if the stranger was indeed the  Dor-ul-Otho while leaving his dignity a loophole of escape should it  appear that he had entertained an impostor.    \"If indeed you are the Dor-ul-Otho,\" he said, addressing Tarzan, \"you  will know that our doubts were but natural since we have received no  sign from Jad-ben-Otho that he intended honoring us so greatly, nor how  could we know, even, that the Great God had a son? If you are he, all  Pal-ul-don rejoices to honor you; if you are not he, swift and terrible  shall be the punishment of your temerity. I, Ko-tan, King of  Pal-ul-don, have spoken.\"    \"And spoken well, as a king should speak,\" said Tarzan, breaking his  long silence, \"who fears and honors the god of his people. It is well  that you insist that I indeed be the Dor-ul-Otho before you accord me  the homage that is my due. Jad-ben-Otho charged me specially to  ascertain if you were fit to rule his people. My first experience of  you indicates that Jad-ben-Otho chose well when he breathed the spirit  of a king into the babe at your mother's breast.\"    The effect of this statement, made so casually, was marked in the  expressions and excited whispers of the now awe-struck assemblage. At  last they knew how kings were made! It was decided by Jad-ben-Otho  while the candidate was still a suckling babe!  Wonderful! A miracle!  and this divine creature in whose presence they stood knew all about  it. Doubtless he even discussed such matters with their god daily. If  there had been an atheist among them before, or an agnostic, there was  none now, for had they not looked with their own eyes upon the son of  god?    \"It is well then,\" continued the ape-man, \"that you should assure  yourself that I am no impostor. Come closer that you may see that I am  not as are men. Furthermore it is not meet that you stand upon a higher  level than the son of your god.\" There was a sudden scramble to reach  the floor of the throne-room, nor was Ko-tan far behind his warriors,  though he managed to maintain a certain majestic dignity as he  descended the broad stairs that countless naked feet had polished to a  gleaming smoothness through the ages. \"And now,\" said Tarzan as the  king stood before him, \"you can have no doubt that I am not of the same  race as you. Your priests have told you that Jad-ben-Otho is tailless.  Tailless, therefore, must be the race of gods that spring from his  loins.  But enough of such proofs as these! You know the power of  Jad-ben-Otho; how his lightnings gleaming out of the sky carry death as  he wills it; how the rains come at his bidding, and the fruits and the  berries and the grains, the grasses, the trees and the flowers spring  to life at his divine direction; you have witnessed birth and death,  and those who honor their god honor him because he controls these  things. How would it fare then with an impostor who claimed to be the  son of this all-powerful god?  This then is all the proof that you  require, for as he would strike you down should you deny me, so would  he strike down one who wrongfully claimed kinship with him.\"    This line of argument being unanswerable must needs be convincing.  There could be no questioning of this creature's statements without the  tacit admission of lack of faith in the omnipotence of Jad-ben-Otho.  Ko-tan was satisfied that he was entertaining deity, but as to just  what form his entertainment should take he was rather at a loss to  know. His conception of god had been rather a vague and hazy affair,  though in common with all primitive people his god was a personal one  as were his devils and demons. The pleasures of Jad-ben-Otho he had  assumed to be the excesses which he himself enjoyed, but devoid of any  unpleasant reaction. It therefore occurred to him that the Dor-ul-Otho  would be greatly entertained by eating--eating large quantities of  everything that Ko-tan liked best and that he had found most injurious;  and there was also a drink that the women of the Ho-don made by  allowing corn to soak in the juices of succulent fruits, to which they  had added certain other ingredients best known to themselves. Ko-tan  knew by experience that a single draught of this potent liquor would  bring happiness and surcease from worry, while several would cause even  a king to do things and enjoy things that he would never even think of  doing or enjoying while not under the magical influence of the potion,  but unfortunately the next morning brought suffering in direct ratio to  the joy of the preceding day. A god, Ko-tan reasoned, could experience  all the pleasure without"]]]
