This flight of stairs may be entered directly from the  kitchen, leading either to the chamber, or under them, into the cellar,  without coming into the passage connecting with the entry or  dining-room, if preferred. In such case, a broad stair of thirty inches  in width should be next the door, on which to turn, as the door would be  at right angles with the stairs, either up or down.    The kitchen is 20x16 feet, and 11 feet high. It has an outer door  leading on the rear porch, and a window on each side of that door; also  a window, under which is a sink, on the opposite side, at the end of a  passage four feet wide, leading through the lean-to. It has also an open  fireplace, and an oven by the side of it--old fashion. It may be also  furnished with a cooking range, or stove--the smoke and fumes leading by  a pipe into a flue into the chimney. On the lean-to side is a milk or  dairy-room, 8x8 feet, lighted by a window. Here also the kitchen  furniture and meats may be stored in cupboards made for the purpose.  In rear of the kitchen, and leading from it by a door through a lighted  passage next the rear porch, is the wash-room, 16x16 feet, lighted by a  large window from the porch side. A door also leads out of the rear on  to a platform into the wood-house. Another door leads from the wash-room  into a bath-room in the lean-to 8x8 feet, into which warm water is drawn  by a pipe and pump from the boiler in the wash-room; or, if preferred,  the bath-room may be entered from the main kitchen, by the passage next  the sink. This bath-room is lighted by a window. Next to the bath-room  is a bedroom for a man servant who has charge of the fires, and heavy  house-work, wood, &c., &c. This bedroom is also 8x8 feet, and lighted by  a window in the lean-to. In front of this wash-room and kitchen is a  porch, eight inches below the floor, six feet wide, with a railing, or  not, as may be preferred. (The railing is made in the cut.) A platform,  three feet wide, leads from the back door of the wash-room to a  water-closet for the family _proper_. The wood-house is open in front,  with a single post supporting the center of the roof. At the extreme  outer angle is a water-closet for the domestics of the establishment.    Adjoining the wood-house, and opening from it into the L before  mentioned, is a workshop, and small-tool-house, 20x16 feet, lighted by a  large double window at one end. In this should be a carpenter's  work-bench and tool-chest, for the repairs of the farming utensils and  vehicles. Overhead is a store-room for lumber, or whatever else may be  necessary for use in that capacity. Next to this is a granary or  feed-room, 20x10 feet, with a small chimney in one corner, where may be  placed a boiler to cook food for pigs, poultry, &c., as the case may be.  Here may also be bins for storage of grain and meal. Leading out of this  is a flight of stairs passing to the chamber above, and a passage four  feet wide, through the rear, into a yard adjoining. At the further end  of the stairs a door opens into a poultry house, 16x10 feet, including  the stairs. The poultry room is lighted at the extreme left corner, by a  broad window. In this may be made roosts, and nesting places, and  feeding troughs. A low door under the window may be also made for the  fowls in passing to the rear yard. Adjoining the granary, and leading to  it by a door, is the carriage-house, 20x20 feet, at the gable end of  which are large doors for entrance. From the carriage-house is a broad  passage of six feet, into the stables, which are 12 feet wide, and  occupy the lean-to. This lean-to is eight feet high below the eaves,  with two double stalls for horses, and a door leading into the _side_  yard, with the doors of the carriage-house. A window also lights the  rear of the stables. A piggery 12 feet square occupies the remainder of  the lean-to in rear of the poultry-house, in which two or three pigs can  always be kept, and fatted on the offal of the house, for _small_ pork,  at any season, apart from the swine stock of the farm. A door leads out  of the piggery into the rear yard, where range also the poultry. As the  _shed_ roof shuts down on to the pigsty and stables, no loft above them  is necessary. In the loft over the granary, poultry, and carriage-house  is deposited the hay, put in there through the doors which appear in the  design.    CHAMBER PLAN.--This is easily understood. At the head of the stairs,  over the main hall, is a large passage leading to the porch, and opening  by a door-window on the middle deck of the veranda, which is nearly  level, and tinned, or coppered, water-tight, as are also the two sides.  On either side of this upper hall is a door leading to the front  sleeping chambers, which are well closeted, and spacious. If it be  desirable to construct more sleeping-rooms, they can be partitioned  laterally from the hall, and doors made to enter them. A rear hall is  cut off from the front, lighted by a window over the lower rear porch,  and a door leads into a further passage in the wing, four feet wide,  which leads down a flight of stairs into the kitchen below. At the head  of this flight is a chamber 20x12 feet, for the female domestic's  sleeping-room, in which may be placed a stove, if necessary, passing its  pipe into the kitchen chimney which passes through it.      [Illustration: CHAMBER PLAN.]    It is also lighted by a window over the lean-to, on the side. Back of  this, at the end of the passage, is the sleeping-room, 16 feet square,  for the \"men-folks,\" lighted on both sides by a window. This may also be  warmed, if desired, by a stove, the pipe passing into the kitchen  chimney.    The cellar may extend under the entire house and wing, as convenience or  necessity may require. If it be constructed under the main body only, an  offset should be excavated to accommodate the cellar stairs, three feet  in width, and walled in with the rest. A wide, _outer_ passage, with a  flight of steps should also be made under the rear nursery window, for  taking in and passing out bulky articles, with double doors to shut down  upon it; and partition walls should be built to support the partitions  of the large rooms above. Many minor items of detail might be mentioned,  all of which are already treated in the general remarks, under their  proper heads, in the body of the work, and which cannot here be  noticed--such as the mode of warming it, the construction of furnaces,  &c.    It may, by some builders, be considered a striking defect in the  interior accommodation of a house of this character, that the chief  entrance hall should not be extended through, from its front to the  rear, as is common in many of the large mansions of our country.  We object to the large, open hall for more than one reason, except,  possibly, in a house for _summer_ occupation only. In the first place it  is uncomfortable, in subjecting the house to an unnecessary draught of  air when it is not needed, in cold weather. Secondly, it cuts the house  into two distinct parts, making them inconvenient of access in crossing  its wide surface. Thirdly, it is uneconomical, in taking up valuable  room that can be better appropriated. For summer ventilation it is  unnecessary; that may be given by simply opening the front door and a  chamber window connected with the hall above, through which a current of  fresh air will always pass. Another thing, the hall belongs to the  front, or _dress_ part of the house, and should be _cut off_ from the  more domestic and common apartments by a partition, although accessible  to them, and not directly communicating with such apartments, which  cannot of necessity, be in keeping with its showy and pretending  character. It should contain only the _front_ flight of stairs, as a  part of its appointments, besides the doors leading to its best  apartments on the ground floor, which should be centrally placed--its  rear door being of a less pretending and subordinate character. Thus,  the hall, with its open doors, connecting the best rooms of the house on  each side, with its ample flight of stairs in the background, gives a  distinct expression of superiority in occupation to the other and  humbler portions of the dwelling.    In winter, too, how much more snug and comfortable is the house, shut in  from the prying winds and shivering cold of the outside air, which the  opposite outer doors of an open hall cannot, in their continual opening  and shutting, altogether exclude! Our own experience, and, we believe,  the experience of most housekeepers will readily concede its defects;  and after full reflection we have excluded it as both unnecessary and  inconvenient.    Another objection has been avoided in the better class of houses here  presented, which has crept into very many of the designs of modern  builders; which is, that of using the living rooms of the family, more  or less, as passages from the kitchen apartments in passing to and from  the front hall, or chief entrance. Such we consider a decided objection,  and hence arose, probably, the older plans of by-gone years, of making  the main hall reach back to the kitchen itself. This is here obviated by  a cutting up of the rear section of the hall, by which a passage, in all  cases of the better kind of dwelling, is preserved, without encroaching  upon the occupied rooms in passing out and in. To be sure, the front  door is not the usual passage for the laborers or servants of the house,  but they are subject, any hour of the day, to be called there to admit  those who may come, and the continual opening of a private room for such  purposes is most annoying. Therefore, as matter of convenience, and as a  decided improvement on the designs above noticed, we have adhered  strictly to the separate rear passage.    The _garret_, also, as we have arranged our designs, is either  altogether left "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#20)"],[1,"eakspear) granted it to the  abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought  up.  Next after the abbot of St Alban's ranked the abbot of  Westminster.  To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained  that their mitre should be made of less costly materials,  and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule which was soon  entirely disregarded, and that the crook of their pastoral  staff should turn inwards instead of outwards, indicating  that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house.    The adoption of episcopal insignia by abbots was followed  by an encroachment on episcopal functions, which had to be  specially but ineffectually guarded against by the Lateran  council, A.D. 1123.  In the East, abbots, if in priests'  orders, with the consent of the bishop, were, as we have  seen, permitted by the second Nicene council, A.D. 787,  to confer the tonsure and admit to the order of reader; but  gradually abbots, in the West also, advanced higher claims,  until we find them in A.D. 1489 permitted by Innocent  IV. to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate.  Of  course, they always and everywhere had the power of admitting  their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit.    When a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose  the abbot out of the monks of the convent, but the right  of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks  themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the  election and the benediction of the new abbot.  In abbeys  exempt from episcopal jurisdiction, the confirmation and  benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house  being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to  Rome.  By the rule of St Benedict, the consent of the laity  was in some undefined way required; but this seems never  to have been practically enforced.  It was necessary that  an abbot should be at least 25 years of age, of legitimate  birth, a monk of the house, unless it furnished no suitable  candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another  convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others,  one also who had learned how to command by having practised  obedience.  In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed  to name his own successor.  Cassian speaks of an abbot in  Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example  in the case of St Bruno.  Popes and sovereigns gradually  encroached on the rights of the monks, until in Italy the  pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in  France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontre and other  houses, chiefs of their order.  The election was for life,  unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of  his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the  pope or the bishop.  The ceremony of the formal admission of  a Benedictine abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by  the consuetudinary of Abingdon.  The newly elected abbot was  to put off his shoes at the door of the church, and proceed  barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a  procession.  After proceeding up the nave, he was to kneel  and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir,  into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his  commissary, and placed in his stall.  The monks, then kneeling,  gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the  mouth, the abbot holding his staff of office.  He then put  on his shoes in the vestry, and a chapter was held, and  the bishop or his commissary preached a suitable sermon.    The power of the abbot was paternal but absolute, limited,  however, by the canons of the church, and, until the general  establishment of exemptions, by episcopal control.  As a  rule, however, implicit obedience was enforced; to act  without his orders was culpable; while it was a sacred duty  to execute his orders, however unreasonable, until they were  withdrawn.  Examples among the Egyptian monks of this blind  submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into  a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the  individual will as the highest excellence, are detailed by  Cassian and others,--- e.g. a monk watering a dry stick,  day after day, for months, or endeavouring to remove a huge  rock immensely exceeding his powers.  St Jerome, indeed, lays  down, as the principle of the compact between the abbot and his  monks, that they should obey their superiors in all things,  and perform whatever they commanded (Ep. 2, ad Eustoch. de  custod. virgin.). So despotic did the tyranny become in the  West, that in the time of Charlemagne it was necessary to  restrain abbots by legal enactments from mutilating their  monks and putting out their eyes; while the rule of St  Columban ordained 100 lashes as the punishment for very slight  offences.  An abbot also had the power of excommunicating  refractory nuns, which he might use if desired by their abbess.    The abbot was treated with the utmost submission and reverence  by the brethren of his house.  When he appeared either in  church or chapter all present rose and bowed.  His letters  were received kneeling, like those of the pope and the  king.  If he gave a command, the monk receiving it was also to  kneel.  No monk might sit in his presence, or leave it without his  permission.  The highest place was naturally assigned to him,  both in church and at table.  In the East he was commanded to  eat with the other monks.  In the West the rule of St Benedict  appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain  guests and strangers.  This permission opening the door to  luxurious living, the council of Aix, A.D. 817, decreed that  the abbot should dine in the refectory, and be content with  the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a  guest.  These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual  to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature  abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the  inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots.  When the  abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his chaplains waited  upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting  them.  At St Alban's the abbot took the lord's seat, in the  centre of the high table, and was served on silver plate, and  sumptuously entertained noblemen, ambassadors and strangers of  quality.  When abbots dined in their own private hall, the rule  of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table,  provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were  to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping.    The ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be  the same as that of the monks.  But by the 10th century the  rule was commonly set aside, and we find frequent complaints of  abbots dressing in silk, and adopting sumptuous attire.  They  sometimes even laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and  assumed a secular dress.1 This was a necessary consequence of  their following the chase, which was quite usual, and indeed at  that time only natural.  With the increase of wealth and power,  abbots had lost much of their special religious character, and  become great lords, chiefly distinguished from lay lords by  celibacy.  Thus we hear of abbots going out to sport, with  their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs and  huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of Leicester,  c. 1360, who was the most skilled of all the nobility in  harehunting.  In magnificence of equipage and retinue the  abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm.  They rode  on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles and housings,  carrying hawks on their wrist, followed by an immense train of  attendants.  The bells of the churches were rung as they  passed.  They associated on equal terms with laymen of the  highest distinction, and shared all their pleasures and  pursuits.  This rank and power was, however, often used most  beneficially.  For instance, we read of Whiting, the last  abbot of Glastonbury, judicially murdered by Henry VIII.,  that his house was a kind of well-ordered court, where as  many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent  to him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides  others of a meaner rank, whom he fitted for the universities.  His table, attendance and officers were an honour to the  nation.  He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at  one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a  week.  He had his country houses and fisheries, and when  he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to  upwards of 100 persons.  The abbots of Cluny and Vendome  were, by virtue of their office, cardinals of the Roman church.    In process of time the title abbot was improperly transferred  to clerics who had no connexion with the monastic system,  as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy; and  under the Carolingians to the chief chaplain of the king,  Abbas Curiae, or military chaplain of the emperor, Abbas  Castrensis. It even came to be adopted by purely secular  officials.  Thus the chief magistrate of the republic at Genoa  was called Abbas Populi. Du Cange, in his glossary, also gives  us Abbas Campanilis, Clocherii, Palatii, Scholaris, &c.    Lay abbots (M. Lat. defensores, abbacomites, abbates laici,  abbates milites, abbates saeculares or irreligiosi,  abbatiarii, or sometimes simply abbates) were the outcome  of the growth of the feudal system from the 8th century  onwards.  The practice of commendation, by which---to meet  a contemporary emergency--the revenues of the community were  handed over to a lay lord, in return for his protection,  early suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of  rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held in commendam.  During the Carolingian epoch the custom grew up of granting  these as regular heritable fiefs or benefices, and by"]]]
