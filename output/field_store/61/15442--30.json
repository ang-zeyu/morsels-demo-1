That, he said, is a very just remark.    But if this is true, then certain professors of education must be  mistaken in saying that they can put a knowledge into the soul which  was not there before, like giving eyes to the blind.    Yes, that is what they say, he replied.    Whereas, I said, our argument shows that the power is already in the  soul; and that as the eye can not turn from darkness to light without  the whole body, so too, when the eye of the soul is turned round, the  whole soul must be turned from the world of generation into that of  being, and become able to endure the sight of being and of the  brightest and best of being--that is to say, of the good.    Very true.    And this is conversion; and the art will be how to accomplish this as  easily and completely as possible; not implanting eyes, for they exist  already, but giving them a right direction, which they have not.    Yes, he said, that may be assumed.    And hence while the other qualities seem to be akin to the body, being  infused by habit and exercise and not originally innate, the virtue of  wisdom is part of a divine essence, and has a power which is  everlasting, and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable,  and is also capable of becoming hurtful and useless. Did you never  observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever  rogue--how eager he is, how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to  his end; he is the reverse of blind, but his keen sight is taken into  the service of evil, and he is dangerous in proportion to his  intelligence?    Very true, he said.    But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days  of their youth; and they had been severed from the leaden weights, as  I may call them, with which they are born into the world, which lead  on to sensual pleasures, such as those of eating and drinking, and  drag them down and turn the vision of their souls about the things  that are below--if, I say, these natures had been released from these  tendencies and turned round to the truth, the very same faculty in  these very same persons would have seen the other as keenly as they  now see that on which the eye is fixt.    That is very likely.    Yes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather a  necessary inference from what has proceeded, that neither the  uneducated and uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make  an end of their education, will be able ministers of state; not the  former, because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of  their actions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they  will not act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are  already in the islands of the blest.    Very true, he replied.    Then, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the state  will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which has  been already declared by us to be the greatest of all--to that  eminence they must ascend and arrive at the good, and when they have  ascended and seen enough we must not allow them to do as they do now.    What do you mean?    I mean that they remain in the upper world; but this must not be  allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the  den, and partake of their labors and honors, whether they are worth  having or not.    But is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them an inferior  life, when they might have a superior one?    You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the  legislator; he did not aim at making any one class in the state happy  above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole state, and he  held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them  benefactors of one another; to this end he created them, not that they  should please themselves, but they were to be his instruments in  binding up the state.    True, he said, I had forgotten that.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 56: Plato is one of the very few Greek authors none of whose  work has been lost. He shares this good fortune with Xenophon.

And if you are satisfied, and if you are unable to show  any good or evil which does not end in pleasure and pain, hear the  consequences: If this is true, then I say that the argument is absurd  which affirms that a man often does evil knowingly when he might  abstain, because he is seduced and amazed by pleasure; or again, when  you say that a man knowingly refuses to do what is good because he is  overcome at the moment by pleasure. Now that this is ridiculous will  be evident if we only give up the use of various names, such as  pleasant and painful and good and evil. As there are two things, let  us call them by two names--first, good and evil, and then pleasant and  painful. Assuming this, let us go on to say that a man does evil  knowing that he does evil. But some one will ask, Why? Because he is  overcome, is the first answer. And by what is he overcome? the  inquirer will proceed to ask. And we shall not be able to reply, by  pleasure, for the name of pleasure has been exchanged for that of  good.    In our answer, then, we shall say only that he is overcome. By what?  he will reiterate. By the good, we shall have to reply; indeed, we  shall. Nay, but our questioner will rejoin with a laugh, if he be one  of the swaggering sort, that is too ridiculous, that a man should do  what he knows to be evil when he ought not, because he is overcome by  good. Is that, he will ask, because the good was worthy or not worthy  of conquering the evil? And in answer to that we shall clearly reply,  because it was not worthy; for if it had been worthy, then he who, as  we say, was overcome by pleasure, would not have been wrong. But how,  he will reply, can the good be unworthy of the evil, or the evil of  the good? Is not the real explanation that they are out of proportion  to each other, either as greater and smaller, or more and fewer? This  we can not deny. And when you speak of being overcome, what do you  mean, he will say, but that you choose the greater evil in exchange  for the lesser good? This being the case, let us now substitute the  names of pleasure and pain, and say, not as before, that a man does  what is evil knowingly, but that he does what is painful knowingly,  and because he is overcome by pleasure, which is unworthy to overcome.  And what measure is there of the relations of pleasure to pain other  than excess and defect, which means that they become greater and  smaller, and more and fewer, and differ in degree? For if any one  says, Yes, Socrates, but immediate pleasure differs widely from future  pleasure and pain, to which I should reply: And do they differ in any  other way except by reason of pleasure and pain? There can be no other  measure of them. And do you, like a skilful weigher, put into the  balance the pleasures and the pains, near and distant, and weigh them,  and then say which outweighs the other? If you weigh pleasures against  pleasures, you of course take the more and greater; or if you weigh  pains against pains, you take the fewer and the less; or if pleasures  against pains, then you choose that course of action in which the  painful is exceeded by the pleasant, whether the distant by the near  or the near by the distant; and you avoid that course of action in  which the pleasant is exceeded by the painful. Would you not admit, my  friends, that this is true? I am confident that they can not deny  this.    He agreed with me.    Well then, I shall say, if you admit that, be so good as to answer me  a question: Do not the same magnitudes appear larger to your sight  when near, and smaller when at a distance. They will acknowledge that.  And the same holds of thickness and number; also sounds which are in  themselves equal are greater when near and lesser when at a distance.  They will grant that also. Now supposing that happiness consisted in  making and taking large things, what would be the saving principle of  human life? Would the art of measuring be the saving principle or  would the power of appearance? Is not the latter that deceiving art  which makes us wander up and down and take the things at one time of  which we repent at another, both in our actions and in our choice of  things great and small? But the art of measurement is that which would  do away with the effect of appearances, and, showing the truth, would  fain teach the soul at last to find rest in the truth, and would thus  save our life. Would not mankind generally acknowledge that the art  which accomplishes this is the art of measurement?    Yes, he said, the art of measurement.    Suppose, again, the salvation of human life to depend on the choice of  odd and even, and on the knowledge of when men ought to choose the  greater or less, either in reference to themselves or to each other  whether near or at a distance; what would be the saving principles of  our lives? Would not knowledge?--a knowledge of measuring, when the  question is one of excess and defect, and a knowledge of number, when  the question is of odd and even? The world will acknowledge that, will  they not?    Protagoras admitted that they would.    Well then, I say to them, my friends, seeing that the salvation of  human life has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],[0,"South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#20)"],[1,"Emperor Montezuma  Xocoyotzin.  This was the second Montezuma who had occupied the  imperial throne and his last name means \"The Younger,\" which he adopted  to distinguish him from his predecessor in the empire.    This Lord of Painala, whose name has been forgotten, unfortunately for  his country departed this life soon after the birth of his daughter,  who was called Malinal because she was born on the twelfth day of the  month, her name indicating that fact.  His property naturally devolved  upon the young daughter.  Her mother assumed the office of guardian and  regent of the state.  This lady, whose name has also been lost in  oblivion, did not long remain single.  After her second marriage, which  apparently took place with a somewhat indecent hurry, there was born to  {116} her and her new consort, a young son.  To secure to this son the  inheritance, she sold her little daughter, too young to realize the  unfortunate transaction, to some traders of Xicalango, who in turn  disposed of her to a coast tribe of Aztecs called the Tabascans.  She  lived in bondage with the Tabascans until she was nineteen years old.  She developed into a woman of rare beauty and unusual intellect.  Something of the power of high birth was evidently hers, for she  escaped the degrading servitude of the time, and was carefully trained  and prepared for some higher purpose.  This girl was to be the  instrument of the downfall of her native land.    Now it happened that when Malinal was nineteen years old, the rumor of  a strange visitation ran up and down the shore among the people who  dwelt upon the great Gulf of Mexico.  Some remarkable beings, the like  of whom had never been seen or heard of within the memory of living  man, in some remarkable boats which absolutely transcended the  imagination of the Aztecs, had been seen upon the coast and some of  them had landed at different points.  Also there had sifted from the  south, from the Isthmus of Darien and the Panama States, some account  of these white-skinned demi-gods.  Just enough rumor was current to  cause alarm and uneasiness in the Aztec Empire when the attention of  the rulers was called to some definite facts.    On Good Friday, March 23, 1519, the dreaded and expected happened, for  there landed at what is now the city of Vera Cruz, in the territory of  the Tabascans, vassals of Montezuma, a party of these strange  adventurers.  They were led by a man of mature years, whose name was  Fernando Cortes--sometimes written {117} Hernando Cortes.  Like  Pizarro, whose history has been related, he was from the forgotten  province of Estremadura.  He was born in the year 1485, in the city of  Medellin.  He was seven years old when Columbus set sail upon that  epoch-making voyage of discovery and he was thirty-four when he set  foot for the first time on the shores of Mexico.  In the intervening  years much interesting and valuable experience had been enjoyed.    The parents of Cortes belonged to the provincial nobility.  They were  worthy and respectable subjects of the King of Spain.  The  old-fashioned adjectives, \"poor, but honest\" could be applied to them.  The boy was a puny, sickly lad, whom they scarcely expected to reach  man's estate.  When he was fourteen years old they entered him in the  great University of Salamanca where he took his degree as Bachelor of  Laws, after a two years' course.  The law, in Spain, was considered an  entirely proper profession for the nobility, especially when the  nobility were unable, through narrow circumstances, properly to support  the profession of arms.  Cortes, therefore, was in receipt of a liberal  education for his day.  His letters, some of which will be quoted  hereafter, are evidences of his mental training.  In some respects they  are as interesting as are the famous Commentaries of Julius Caesar.    The young man, whose constitution improved as he grew older, until he  eventually became the hardiest, most enduring and bravest of his  company, which included the most intrepid men of the age, had no love  for the humdrum profession of law.  He desired to go to Italy and take  service with Gonsalvo de Cordova, who is remembered, when he is  remembered at all, as \"The Great Captain\"; but sickness prevented.  {118} Following that, his thoughts turned, as did those of so many  Spanish youths who were of an adventurous disposition, toward the New  World.  After many setbacks, one of which was caused by a wound  received by the hot-blooded young man while engaged in a love affair,  and which left a permanent scar upon his upper lip, he finally landed  at Santo Domingo in the Spring of 1504.  From there he went to Cuba and  served under one Diego Velasquez, the governor of that province in some  fierce fighting in the island, and received as a reward from the  governor, who was much attached to him, a large plantation with a  number of Indians to work it.  There he married and lived prosperously.  What he had done before he arrived in Mexico counted little.  What he  did afterward gave him eternal fame as one, if not the greatest, of the  conquerors and soldiers of fortune in all history.  Sir Arthur Helps  thus portrays him:    \"Cortes,\" he says, \"was an heroic adventurer, a very politic statesman,  and an admirable soldier.  He was cruel at times in conduct, but not in  disposition; he was sincerely religious, profoundly dissembling,  courteous, liberal, amorous, decisive.  There was a certain grandeur in  all his proceedings.  He was fertile in resources; and, while he looked  forward, he was at the same time almost madly audacious in his  enterprises.  This strange mixture of valor, religion, policy, and  craft, was a peculiar product of the century. . . .  There are two main  points in his character which I shall dwell upon at the outset.  These  are his soldier-like qualities and his cruelty.  As a commander, the  only fault imputed to him, was his recklessness in exposing himself to  the dangers of personal conflict with the enemy.  But then, that is an  error {119} to be commonly noticed even in the greatest generals of  that period; and Cortes, with this singular dexterity in arms, was  naturally prone to fall into this error.  As regards his peculiar  qualifications as a commander, it may be observed, that, great as he  was in carrying out large and difficult operations in actual warfare,  he was not less so in attending to those minute details upon which so  much of the efficiency of troops depends.  His companion-in-arms,  Bernal Diaz, says of him, 'He would visit the hut of every soldier, see  that his arms were ready at hand, and that he had his shoes on.  Those  whom he found had neglected anything in this way he severely  reprimanded, and compared them to mangy sheep, whose own wool is too  heavy for them.'    \"I have said that he was cruel in conduct, but not in disposition.  This statement requires explanation.  Cortes was a man who always  determined to go through with the thing he had once resolved to do.  Human beings, if they came in his way, were to be swept out of it, like  any other material obstacles.  He desired no man's death, but if people  would come between him and success, they must bear the consequences.  He did not particularly value human life.  The ideas of the nineteenth  century in that respect were unknown to him.  He had come to conquer,  to civilize, to convert (for he was really a devout man from his youth  upward); and, as his chaplain takes care to tell us, knew many prayers  and psalms of the choir by heart; and the lives of thousands of  barbarians, for so he deemed them, were of no account in the balance of  his mind, when set against the great objects he had in view.  In saying  this, I am not apologizing for this cruelty; I am only endeavoring to  explain it.    \"Of all the generals who have been made known {120} to us in history,  or by fiction, Claverhouse, as represented by Sir Walter Scott, most  closely resembles Cortes.  Both of them thorough gentlemen, very  dignified, very nice and precise in all their ways and habits, they  were sadly indifferent to the severity of the means by which they  compassed their ends; and bloody deeds sat easily, for the most part,  upon their well-bred natures.  I make these comments once for all; and  shall hold myself excused from making further comments of a like nature  when any of the cruelties of Cortes come before us--cruelties which one  must ever deeply deplore on their own account, and bitterly regret as  ineffaceable strains upon the fair fame and memory of a very great man.  . . .  The conquest of Mexico could hardly have been achieved at this  period under any man of less genius than that which belonged to  Hernando Cortes.  And even his genius would probably not have attempted  the achievement, or would have failed in it, but for a singular  concurrence of good and evil fortune, which contributed much to the  ultimate success of his enterprise.  Great difficulties and fearful  conflicts of fortune not only stimulate to great attempts, but  absolutely create the opportunities for them.\"      II. The Expedition to Mexico.    Reports brought back to Cuba by one Juan de Grijilva, who told of the  populous and wealthy cities of the main land to the westward of Cuba,  induced Velasquez to fit out an expedition for exploration,  colonization or whatever might turn up.  Casting about among his  friends, followers, and acquaintances for a suitable leader, his choice  after some hesitation {121} devolved upon Cortes.  This nascent captain  had not lived at the provincial court of Velasquez without impressing  his characteristics upon those with whom he came in contact.  After the  outfitting of the expedition had progressed considerably, Velasquez was  warned that Cortes was of too high and resolved a spirit to be trusted  with an independent command, and it was probable that upon this  opportunity he would disregard"]]]
