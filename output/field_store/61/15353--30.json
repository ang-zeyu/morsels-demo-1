It is only when the  peculiarities of structure are indicative of specialty of design, that  they form a safe ground of classification. If the teeth of one animal  are formed to fit it to feed on flesh, and those of another to fit it to  feed on plants; if one has webbed feet and another not; then, in all  such cases, difference of structure proves difference of kind. (2.)  Physiological; that is, the internal nature, indicated by habits and  instincts, furnishes another safe criterion. (3.) Permanent fecundity.  The progenitors of the same species reproduce their kind from generation  to generation; the progeny of different species, although nearly allied,  do not. It is a fixed law of nature that species never can be  annihilated, except by all the individuals included in them dying out;  and that new species cannot be produced. Every true species is  primordial. It is this fact, that is, that no variety, with the  essential characteristics of species, has ever been produced, that  forces, as we saw above, Professor Huxley to pronounce Mr. Darwin's  doctrine to be an unproved hypothesis. Species continue; varieties, if  let alone, always revert to the normal type. It requires the skill and  constant attention of man to keep them distinct.    Now that there are such forms in nature, is proved not only from the  testimony of the great body of the most distinguished naturalists, but  by all the facts in the case.    First, the fact that such species are known to have existed unchanged,  through what geologists consider almost immeasurable periods of time.  Palaeontologists tell us that Trilobites abounded from the primordial age  down to the Carboniferous period, that is, as they suppose, through  millions of years. More wonderful still, the little animals whose  remains constitute the chalk formations which are spread over large  areas of country, and are sometimes a hundred feet thick, are now at  work at the bottom of the Atlantic. Principal Dawson tells us, with  regard to Mollusks existing in a sub-fossil state in the Post-pliocene  clays of Canada, that \"after carefully studying about two hundred  species, and of some of these, many hundreds of specimens, I have  arrived at the conclusion that they are absolutely unchanged.... Here  again we have an absolute refusal, on the part of all these animals, to  admit that they are derived, or have tended to sport into new  species.\"[51]    On the previous page he says, \"Pictet catalogues ninety-eight species of  mammals which inhabited Europe in the Post-glacial period. Of these  fifty-seven still exist unchanged, and the remainder have disappeared.  Not one can be shown to have been modified into a new form, though some  of them have been obliged, by changes of temperature and other  conditions, to remove into distant and now widely separated regions.\"    A second fact which attests the primordial character and fixedness of  species is, that every species as it first appears, is not in a  transition state between one form and another, but in the perfection of  its kind. Science has indeed discovered an ascending order in creation,  which agrees marvellously with that given in the book of Genesis: first,  vegetable productions; then the moving creatures in the sea; then  terrestrial animals; and finally man. Naturalists, who utterly reject  the Scriptures as a divine revelation, speak with the highest admiration  of the Mosaic account of the creation, as compared with any other  cosmogony of the ancient world. While there is in general an ascending  series in these living forms, each was perfect in its kind.    Agassiz says that fishes existed contemporaneously with species of all  the invertebrate sub-kingdoms in the Taconic, or sub-Cambrian strata.  This is the extreme limit of known geological strata in which life is  found to have existed. As the evolution of one species out of another  requires, according to Darwin, millions of years, it is out of the  question to trace these animals beyond the strata in which their remains  are now found. Yet \"crabs or lobsters, worms, cuttle-fish, snails,  jelly-fish, star-fish, oysters, the polyps lived contemporaneously with  the first known vertebrate animals that ever came into being--all as  clearly defined by unmistakable ordinal or special characters as they  are at the present moment.\"[52]    The foot of the horse is considered by zooelogists as \"one of the most  beautiful contrivances in nature.\" The remains of this animal found in  what is called the Pliocene Period, show the foot to have been as  perfect then as it is now.    Mr. Wallace says that man has existed on the earth a hundred thousand  years, and that it is probable that he existed four hundred thousand  years ago. Of course we do not believe this. We have little faith in the  chronology of science. It gives no sure data for the calculation of  time, hence we find them differing from four thousand to four hundred  thousand years as to the time required for certain formations. The most  trustworthy geologists teach that all that is known of the antiquity of  man falls within the limits of Biblical chronology. The further,  however, Darwinians push back the origin of man, the stronger, as  against them, becomes the argument for the immutability of species. The  earliest remains of man show that at his first appearance, he was in  perfection. The oldest known human skull is that called the \"Engis,\"  because found in the cave of Engis in Belgium. Of this skull Professor  Huxley says it may have belonged to an individual of one of the existing  races of men. Principal Dawson, who has a cast of it, on the same shelf  with the skulls of some Algonquin Indians, says it might be taken for  the skull of an American Indian. Indeed, Dawson seems to think that  these fossil human remains go to show that the earliest men were better  developed than any of the extant races.    Thirdly. The historical evidence accessible all goes to prove the  immutability of species. The earliest historical records and the oldest  monuments prove that all extant animals were what they now are thousands  of years ago.    Fourthly. The fact that hybrids cannot be perpetuated, that no device of  man can produce a new species, is proof that God has fixed limits which  cannot be passed. This Huxley himself admits to be an insuperable  objection. So long as it exists, he says, Darwin's doctrine must be  content to remain a hypothesis; it cannot pretend to the dignity of a  theory. Another fact of like import is that varieties artificially  produced, if let alone, uniformly revert to the simple typical form. It  is only by the utmost care they can be kept distinct. All the highly  prized varieties of horses, cattle, sheep, pigeons, etc., without human  control, would be merged each class into one, with only the slight  differences occasioned by diversities of climate and other external  conditions. If in the sight of man it is important that the words of a  book should be kept distinct, it is equally evident that in the sight of  God it is no less important that the \"units of nature\" should not be  mixed in inextricable and indistinguishable confusion.    Fifthly. The sudden appearance of new kinds of animals is another fact  which Palaeontologists urge against the doctrine of evolution. According  to the view of geologists great changes have, at remote periods,  occurred in the state of the earth. Continents have been submerged and  the bottom of the sea raised above the surface of the waters.  Corresponding changes have occurred in the state of the atmosphere  surrounding the globe, and in the temperature of the earth. Accompanying  or following these revolutions new classes of plants and animals appear,  adapted to the new condition of the earth's surface. Whence do they  come? They have, as Dawson expresses it, neither fathers nor mothers.  Nothing precedes them from which they could be derived; and nothing of  the same kind follows them. They live through their appointed period;  and then, in a multitude of cases, finally disappear, and are in their  turn followed by new orders or kinds. In other words, the links or  connecting forms of this assumed regular succession or derivation are  not to be found. This fact is so patent, that Hugh Miller, when arguing  against the doctrine of evolution as proposed in the \"Vestiges of  Creation,\" says, that the record in the rocks seems to have been written  for the very purpose of proving that such evolution is impossible.    We have the explicit testimony of Agassiz, as a Palaeontologist, that the  facts of geology contradict the theory of the transmutation of species.  This testimony has been repeatedly given and in various forms. In the  last production of his pen, he says: \"As a Palaeontologist I have from  the beginning stood aloof from this new theory of transmutation, now so  widely admitted by the scientific world. Its doctrines, in fact,  contradict what the animal forms buried in the rocky strata of our earth  tell us of their own introduction and succession upon the surface of the  globe.\" \"Let us look now at the earliest vertebrates, as known and  recorded in geological surveys. They should, of course, if there is any  truth in the transmutation theory, correspond with the lowest in rank or  standing. What then are the earliest known vertebrates? They are  Selachians (sharks and their allies) and Ganoids (garpikes and the  like), the highest of all living fishes, structurally speaking.\" He  closes the article from which these quotations are taken with the  assertion, \"that there is no evidence of a direct descent of later from  earlier species in the geological succession of animals.\"[53] It will be  observed that Agassiz is quoted, not as to matters of theory, but as to  matters of fact. The only answer which evolutionists can make to this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19206"],[0,"Under Drake's Flag: A Tale of the Spanish Main (#20)"],[1,"were alike ready to follow him,  and the next night the whole party, a hundred and fifty strong,  marched down from the forest. The object of their attack was a  handsome palace, belonging to the military governor of the island,  situated at a short distance from the town.    Passing through the cultivated country, noiselessly and without  detection, they reached the mansion and surrounded it. There were,  here, a guard of some thirty soldiers, and sentries were placed at  the entrance.    At the signal, given by the blowing of a conch shell, the attack  commenced on all sides. The sentries were at once shot down, and  the negroes and their allies speedily penetrated into the building.  The Spanish guard fought with great bravery, but they were  overpowered by the infuriated negroes. Yells, shrieks, and shouts  of all kinds resounded through the palace.    Before starting on their adventure, Ned and Gerald had exacted a  solemn oath, from each of the men who were to take part in it, that  on no account would he lift his hand against a defenseless person;  and also that he spare everybody who surrendered. The negroes were  greatly loath to take this promise, and had Ned urged them to do so  purely for the sake of humanity, the oath would unquestionably have  been refused; for in those days of savage warfare, there was little  or no mercy shown on either side. It was only on the ground of  expediency, and the extreme necessity of not irritating the  Spaniards beyond a certain point, that he succeeded in obtaining  their promise.    In the principal room of the palace they found the governor,  himself. His sword was in his hand, and he was prepared to defend  his life to the last. The boys, however, rushed forward; and cried  to him to throw his sword down, as the only plan by which his life  could be saved. The brave officer refused, answering by a vigorous  thrust.    In a moment the two lads had sprung upon him, one from each side,  and wrested his sword from his hand. The negroes, with yells of  triumph, were rushing upon him with drawn swords; but the boys  sternly motioned them back, keeping well in front of their  prisoner.    \"You have sworn,\" they said, \"and the first man who breaks his oath  we will shoot through the head.\"    Then, turning to the governor they said:    \"Sir, you see what these men, whom you have so long hunted as wild  beasts, can do. Take warning from this, and let all in the town  know the determination to which we have arrived. If we are let  alone, we will let others alone. We promise that no serious  depredations, of any kind, shall be performed by any of our party  in the forest; but if we are molested, or if any of our band who  may fall into your hands are ill treated, we swear that, for each  drop of blood slain, we will ravage a plantation and destroy a  house.    \"On this occasion, as you see, the negroes have abstained from  shedding blood; but our influence over them may not avail, in  future. Now that you see that we too can attack, you may think fit  to leave us alone. In case of serious interference with us, we will  lay waste the land, up to the houses of the city; and destroy every  plantation, and hacienda.\"    Then they hurried the governor to a back entrance, gave him his  sword again and, having seen him in safety, fairly beyond the reach  of any of their party who might be wandering about, dismissed him.    Returning to the palace, they had to exert themselves to the utmost  to prevail on the negroes to spare all who were there. Indeed, one  man, who refused to obey Ned's orders and to lower his club, he  shot down at once.    This vigorous act excited, for a moment, yells of indignation among  the rest; but the firm bearing of the two young Englishmen, and the  knowledge that they were acting as they themselves had given them  leave to act, should any of the party break their oaths, subdued  them into silence.    The palace was now stripped of all portable and useful articles.  Ned would not permit anything to be carried away of a merely  ornamental or valuable character; but only such as kitchen  utensils, crockery, stoves, arms, hangings, and articles of a  description that would be useful to them, in their wild life in the  forest. The quantity of arms taken was considerable as, in addition  to those belonging to the guard, there were a considerable number  piled in the armory, in readiness for any occasion when they might  be required.    When all that could be useful to them was removed, lights were  applied to the hangings and wooden lattice work; and, before they  retired, they saw the flames take sufficient possession of the  building to ensure its destruction.    Many of the negroes had at first laden themselves with wine, but  this Ned peremptorily refused to allow them to carry away. He knew  that it was of the most supreme necessity that good fellowship, and  amity, should run between the members of the bands; and that, were  wine to be introduced, quarrels might arise which would, in the  end, prove fatal to all. He allowed, however, sufficient to be  taken away to furnish a reasonable share for each man, at the feast  which it was only natural they would wish to hold, in commemoration  of their victory.          Chapter 8: The Forest Fastness.        It was with a feeling of triumph, indeed, that the negroes, after  gaining their own fastness, looked back at the sky, lighted by the  distant conflagration. They had now, for the first time, inflicted  such a lesson upon their oppressors as would make a deep mark. They  felt themselves to be really free; and knew that they, in their  turn, had struck terror into the hearts of the Spaniards.    Retiring to the depths of the forest, great fires were made. Sheep,  fowls, and other articles of provision, which had been brought  back, were killed and prepared. Huge bonfires were lit, and the  party, secure that, for twenty-four hours at least, the Spaniards  could attempt no retributive measures, sat down to enjoy the  banquet.    They had driven with them a few small bullocks, and also some  scores of sheep. These, however, were not destined for the spit.  They were to be placed in the heart of their country; so that,  unless disturbed by the Spaniards, they might prove a source of  future sustenance to them.    There was wild feasting that night, with dances, and songs of  triumph in the negro and native dialects; and Ned and Gerald were  lauded and praised, as the authors of the change which had taken  place in the condition of the fugitives. Even the stern severity of  Ned's act was thoroughly approved; and it was agreed, again, that  anyone refusing to obey the orders of the white chiefs should  forfeit his life.    The blow which the negroes had struck caused intense consternation  throughout Hispaniola. The younger, and more warlike spirits were  in favor of organizing an instant crusade, for sending to the other  islands for more troops, for surrounding the forest country, and  for putting the last of the negroes to the sword. More peaceful  counsels, however, prevailed; for it was felt that the whole open  country was, as Ned had told the governor, at their mercy; that the  damage which could be inflicted would be enormous; and the  satisfaction of putting the fugitives to death, even if they were  finally conquered, would be but a poor recompense for the blow  which might be given to the prosperity and wealth of the island.  All sorts of schemes were mooted, by which the runaways could be  beguiled into laying down their arms, but no practicable plan could  be hit upon.    In the meantime, in the mountains, the bands improved in drill and  discipline. They had now gained some confidence in themselves, and  gave themselves up heartily to the work. Portions of land, too,  were turned up; and yams and other fruits, on a larger scale than  had hitherto been attempted, were planted. A good supply of goats  was obtained, huts were erected, and the lads determined that, at  least as long as the Spaniards allowed it, their lives should be  made as comfortable as possible.    Fugitive slaves from time to time joined the party; but Ned  strongly discouraged any increase, at present, from this cause. He  was sure that, were the Spaniards to find that their runaways were  sheltered there, and that a general desertion of their slaves might  take place; they would be obliged, in self defense, to root out  this formidable organization in their midst. Therefore, emissaries  were sent out among the negroes, stating that none would be  received, in the mountains, save those who had previously asked  permission; this being only accorded in cases where such extreme  brutality and cruelty had been exercised, by the masters, as would  wholly justify the flight of the slave.    For some months, a sort of truce was maintained between the  Spaniards and this little army in the woods. The blacks observed  the promises, which Ned had made, with great fidelity. The planters  found that no depredations took place, and that the desertions  among their slaves were no more numerous than before; and had it  depended solely upon them, no further measures would have been  taken.    The case, however, was different among the military party in the  island. To them, the failure of the expedition into the forest, and  the burning of the governor's house, were matters which seriously  affected their pride. Defeat by English buccaneers they were  accustomed to; and regarding the English, at sea, as a species of  demon against whom human bravery availed little. They were slightly  touched by it; but that they should be defied by a set of runaway  slaves; and of natives, whom they had formerly regarded with  contempt; was a blow to their pride.    Quietly, and without ostentation, troops were drafted into the  island from the neighboring posts, until a formidable force had  been gathered there. The foresters had now plenty"]]]
