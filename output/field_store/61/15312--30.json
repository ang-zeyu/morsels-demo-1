CROWLEY:    Q. Where did you live in November, 1872?    A. In the city of Rochester.    Q. Do you know the defendants, Jones, Marsh and Hall?    A. I do.    Q. Do you know whether or not they acted as a Board of Registry for the  registration of voters in the first election district, 8th ward, City of  Rochester, preceding the last general election?    A. I know they acted at the November election.    Q. Did they act as a Board of Registry preceding the election?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Was you present on any day when they were registering voters?    A.

Chapman, Lottie B. Anthony,  Susan M. Hough, Hannah Chatfield, Mary S. Hibbard, Rhoda DeGarmo, Jane  Cogswell.    A. I saw a number of them; I didn't see the whole of them.    Q. Do you know by sight, any of those persons whose names I have read?    A. I know a number of them.    Q. Did you see a number of them there?    A. I did.    Q. Did you see any of them register on that day?    A. I did.    Q. Have you a list of those that you saw register?    A. I have, (producing a paper.)    Q. Please state to the Jury, those that you saw register on that day.    A. I can hardly recollect which day they registered.    Q. Either of the days preceding the election, when this Board was in  session.    A. Rhoda DeGarmo, Mary Anthony, Sarah C. Truesdell, Susan M. Hough, Mrs.  M.E. Pulver.    By MR. VAN VOORHIS:    Q. What paper are you reading from?    A. From a memorandum I made at the time--No, it is a paper that was  given on the last day of registry.    Q. A paper that you made yourself?    A. The names that I took.    Q. On the last day of registry?    A. Yes, sir.    By MR. CROWLEY:    Q. State them.    A. The names of the parties that I found on the poll list as having  registered; I didn't see them all register myself, but I did a good  portion of them.    Q. I am asking you to state who you saw register. I don't ask you who  were registered before your attention was called to the list.    A. Well, I saw Rhoda DeGarmo register; Miss Mary Anthony, Sarah C.  Truesdell, Susan M. Hough; I think I saw Nancy M. Chatfield register;  Mrs. Margaret Leyden, Mrs. M.E. Pulver; those I recollect; I was better  acquainted with those than with the others.    Q. At the time you saw these ladies register, were the three inspectors,  Hall, Jones, and Marsh present?    A. Some of the time I saw all three, I think, there; at other times I  saw but two of them; sometimes Hall and Jones, sometimes Marsh and  Jones, sometimes Hall and Marsh; I think they took turns when they went  to dinner.    Q. On the day of election were you at the polls?    A. I was.    Q. Did you see any of these women vote on the day of election?    A. I did.    Q. Were these defendants present when their votes were received?    A. They were.    Q. And did they receive their votes?    A. They did.    Q. Who did you see vote, or offer their votes upon the day of election?    A. Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. McLean, Rhoda DeGarmo, Mary Anthony, Ellen S.  Baker, Sarah C. Truesdell, Mrs. Hough, Mrs. Mosher, Mrs. Leyden, Mrs.  Pulver. I recollect seeing those ladies; in fact, I think I saw the  whole of them vote with the exception of two, but I will not be positive  on that point.    Q. But you saw those whose names you have given?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Do you know how many tickets they voted, or offered to the  inspectors?    A. I think they voted four tickets.    Q. Do you know how these tickets were endorsed, or what they were  called?    A. I was not near enough to see the endorsement; I noticed which boxes  they went into.    Q. Upon the day of election were the defendants Jones, Marsh, and Hall,  acting as inspectors of election?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Receiving votes?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. And were acting as inspectors of election when these ladies voted?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. About what time in the day, or what time in the morning was it that  these ladies voted?    A. I think there had been but a very few votes received in the morning  when a number of them voted.    Q. Well, was it about 5 o'clock in the morning--very early?    A. No, sir; not so early as that; the probability is that there was not  over 20 or 25 votes received before they presented theirs.    _Conceded_: That the women named in the indictment were women on the 5th  day of November, 1872.    _Cross-Examination by_ MR. VAN VOORHIS:    Q. Which of those persons did you see register?    A. Mrs. Hough, Mrs. Pulver, Mrs. Truesdell, Mrs. Leyden.    Q. Do you swear you saw Mrs. Leyden register?    A. I think I did.    Q. Take a second thought and see if you are willing to say you saw her  register--please look off that paper. Do you recollect seeing those  persons register, or do you suppose they did, because you find it on a  paper there?    A. No, sir; I recollect seeing pretty much all of them on my list with  the exception of one or two; I won't be fully positive I saw Mrs. Leyden  register; I saw her vote.    Q. Did you go to Mrs. Leyden's house and advise her to go and register?    A. I don't think I did.    THE COURT: That is not important.    Q. Do you recollect seeing any others register except those you have now  mentioned?    A. I think I saw Mary Anthony.    Q. Any other?    A. Mrs. Chapman.    Q. Can you recollect this without looking at that paper?    A. Well, the object in looking at that paper is to try to refresh my  memory on which day they registered.    Q. Does that paper contain dates?    A. No, sir; it contains the names of all those who registered.    Q. You copied that paper from the registry, didn't you?    A. They were copied by Hall at the time of the election, and handed to  me.    Q. What was your business at the registry at that time?    A. I had a poll list; I was checking parties that I supposed had a legal  right to vote.    Q. What sort of a poll list?    Objected to as immaterial.    THE COURT: It is only competent as a test of his knowledge.    A. I had canvassed the ward and taken a list of all the voters in the  first district; all those that I supposed would be entitled to vote.    Q. You had canvassed the ward in the employment of somebody?    Objected to as immaterial.    Q. How many of these people did you see vote?    A. I think I saw the whole of them vote, with the exception of Mrs.  Hough and Mrs. Cogswell.    Q. Who took Miss Anthony's vote?    A. Mr. Jones.    Q. Were both the other inspectors present when he took it?    A. I believe they were.    Q. Did Jones take all of the votes of those persons whose names you have  on your list?    A. I don't think he did.    Q. Who took any others that you saw?    A. I saw Mr. Hall take some of the ballots.    Q. How many?    A. I couldn't tell how many.    Q. Did you see him take more than one?    A. I don't know as I did.    Q. Do you know whose it was?    A. If I recollect right, it was Mrs. DeGarmo's.    Q. At that time was Jones there?    A. No, I believe Jones had stepped out.    Q. Hall received the vote on account of Jones being absent?    A. I believe so.    Q. Jones' position was at the window receiving votes?    A. Yes, sir.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18284"],[0,"For Every Music Lover (#20)"],[1,"passionate  acting her glowing soul was felt. When she was but seventeen, her  father, seeking an ideal climate, started with his family for Mexico. In  New York she contracted her unfortunate marriage with the French banker,  M. Malibran. She soon returned to Paris and the stage, and later having  obtained a divorce, married the famous violinist De Beriot, with whom  she had a brief but happy union.    Madame Malibran was said to be equally at home in any known school of  her time. Mozart and Cimarosa, Boieldieu and Rossini, Cherubini and  Bellini were all grasped with the same sympathetic comprehension. Sontag  was her rival, Pasta was yet in the height of her fame, but no contrasts  whatever dimmed the glory of Malibran. A rare personal charm added to  her artistic graces. Mr. Chorley describing her, in his recollections,  said that she was better than beautiful, insomuch as a \"speaking Spanish  human countenance by Murillo is ten times more fascinating than many a  faultless face such as Guido could paint.\" When her death was announced,  in 1836, Ole Bull, who had known her well, exclaimed: \"I cannot realize  it. A woman with a soul of fire, so highly endowed, so intense. How I  wept on seeing her as Desdemona! It is not possible she is dead.\"    Pauline Garcia, thirteen years younger than her remarkable sister, and  with a voice similar in quality, also did justice to her father's  rigorous discipline and became famous. She married M. Viardot, opera  director and critic, and after a brilliant career as a singer, gave long  and valuable service as a vocal teacher in Paris. She remained in the  full tide of her activity until she was long past the allotted  threescore years and ten. It is an interesting fact that Madame Mathilde  Marchesi, author of a noted vocal method, 24 books of Vocalises, a  volume of reminiscences, and other works, and once famed as a singer,  is only five years younger than Madame Viardot-Garcia, but at  seventy-six is still teaching--still shining as an authority on the art  of song. Singers seem often to have been long-lived. In truth, there is  that in music which is life-giving.    A songstress whose name will always be mentioned in the same breath with  that of the tenor Mario, who became her husband, and with whom she  toured the United States in 1854, was Giulia Grisi. She was born in  Milan in 1812, made her debut at sixteen, and had an undisputed reign of  over a quarter of a century. Her voice, a pure soprano of finest  quality, brilliant and vibrating, spanned two octaves, from C to C. She  possessed the gift of beauty, and was said to unite the tragic  inspiration of Pasta with the fire and energy of Malibran. A favorite  role with her was that of the Druid priestess in \"Norma.\" Her delivery  of \"Casta Diva\" was said to be a transcendant effort of vocalization.    Living to-day in London at the advanced age of ninety-seven is the elder  brother of Malibran and Viardot-Garcia, Manuel Garcia, the inventor of  the laryngoscope, author of the renowned \"Art of Song,\" and teacher of  Jenny Lind. It was in 1841 that the ever-beloved Swedish Nightingale,  then twenty-one years old, sought him in Paris, with a voice worn from  over-exertion and lack of proper management. In ten months she had  gained all that master could teach her in tone production, blending of  the registers and breath-control. Her own genius, her splendid  individuality, her indefatigable perseverance, did the rest in investing  her dramatic soprano with that sympathetic timbre, that power of  expressing every phase of her artistic conception, that bird-like  quality of the upper notes, that marvelous beauty and equality of the  entire range of two octaves and three quarters (from B below the stave  to G on the fourth line), that exquisite sonority, that penetrating  pianissimo, that unrivalled messa di voce, that mastery over technique  of which so much has been written and said.    Jenny Lind was to Sweden what Ole Bull was to Norway, the inspirer of  noble achievement. The faithful interpreter of the acknowledged  masterpieces of genius in opera, oratorio and song, she also freely  poured forth in gracious waves the poetic, the rugged, and the  exquisitely polished lays of the Northland, making them known for the  first time to thousands of people. It was through her pure and noble  womanhood, quite as much as through her artistic excellence that she  swayed the public and left so deep and enduring an impression. True to  the backbone in her artistic allegiance, she believed that art, the  expression and embodiment of the spiritual principle animating it, could  not fail to elevate to a high spiritual and moral standard the genuine  artist.    She had lived thirty-five happy years with her husband, Mr. Otto  Goldschmidt, pianist, conductor and composer, who still survives her,  when death overtook her at their home on the Malvern Hills, November 2,  1887. When the end drew near, one of her daughters threw open the window  shutters to admit the morning sun. As it came streaming into the room,  Jenny Lind uplifted her voice, and it rang out firm and clear as she  sang the opening measures of Schumann's glorious \"To the Sunshine.\" The  notes were her last. A bust of her was unveiled in Westminster Abbey in  1894.    A Swedish songstress with a powerful, well-trained voice, who before  Jenny Lind won operatic laurels in foreign lands, was Henrietta  Nissen-Saloman, also a pupil of Garcia. Later, the brilliant Swedish  soprano, Christine Nilsson, with a voice of wonderful sweetness and  beauty, reaching with ease F in alt., with the most thorough skill in  vocalization, with dramatic intuitions, expressive powers and magnetic  presence, charmed the public on two continents in such roles as  Marguerite, Mignon, Elsa, Ophelia and Lucia. She, too, bore through the  world with her the northern songs she had learned to cherish in  childhood.    Still another delightful dramatic soprano from the land of Jenny Lind is  Sigrid Arnoldson, who has a beautiful voice, winning personality, and  pronounced musical intelligence. She is still in her prime.    When the name of Adelina Patti is mentioned, we always think of long  enduring vocal powers, many farewells and high prices. Catalani, in her  full splendor, earned about $100,000 a season. Malibran's profits for  eighty-five concerts at La Scala ran to $95,000. Jenny Lind received  $208,675 for ninety-five concerts under Barnum's management. Patti has  had as much as $8,395 for one performance, and long received a fee of  $5,000 a night. In coloratura roles she has been pronounced the greatest  singer of her time, both in opera and concert. Her voice, noted for its  wide compass, exceeding sweetness, marvelous flexibility and perfect  equality, has been so wonderfully well cared for that even now, in her  sixtieth year, she enjoys singing, although she rarely appears in  public. Her sister, Carlotta, was also a coloratura vocalist of  exquisite technique.    Queens of song now pass in swift review before the mind's eye. We recall  Marietta Alboni, the greatest contralto of the middle of the last  century, with a voice rich, mellow, liquid, pure and endowed with  passionate tenderness, the only pupil of Rossini; Theresa Tietiens, with  her mighty dramatic soprano, whose tones were softer than velvet, and  her noble acting; Marie Piccolomini, a winning mezzo-soprano; Parepa  Rosa, with her sweet, strong voice and imposing stage presence; Pescha  Leutner, the star of 1856; Louisa Pyne, the English Sontag; Parodi,  pupil of Pasta; Etelka Gerster, whose beautiful soprano could fascinate  if it could not awe; Pauline Lucca, whose originality, artistic  temperament and intelligence placed her in the front rank of dramatic  sopranos, and many others.    Amalie Materna, dramatic soprano at the Vienna Court Theatre from 1869  to 1896, with great musical and dramatic intelligence, with a voice of  remarkable compass, volume, richness and sustaining power, vibrant with  passionate intensity, and with a noble stage presence, proved to be  Wagner's ideal Bruennhilde and introduced the role at Bayreuth in 1876.  She was also the creator of Kundry at the same place in 1882. She  aroused unbounded enthusiasm as Elizabeth in \"Tannhaeuser,\" and as Isolde  in \"Tristan and Isolde.\" She is not forgotten by those who heard her in  various cities of this country.    The same may be said of Marianne Brandt, who sang the part of Kundry at  the second \"Parsifal\" representation at Bayreuth, having been Frau  Materna's alternate in 1882. With her superbly rich, deep-toned voice  and her splendid vocal and dramatic control she thrilled her audiences  in her Wagnerian roles, in Beethoven's \"Fidelio,\" and in all she  attempted, whether in opera or concert. She was a magnificent  horsewoman, and was perhaps the only Bruennhilde who was able to give  full play on the stage to her Valkyrie charger. It is told by an eye  witness that before a first appearance in a German city she was borne  furiously on the stage at rehearsal by her spirited, prancing steed, and  when she drew him up suddenly, rearing and pawing the air, near the  footlights, the members of the orchestra dropped their instruments and  fled affrighted. It was not long, however, before she succeeded in  winning their confidence, and all went well at the evening performance.    Six more radiant queens of song whose reign belongs to these modern  times must be mentioned in conclusion: Sembrich, Nordica, Calve, Melba,  Sanderson and Eames. These are but a few of the many present day rulers  in the realms of song.    Marcella Sembrich, a coloratura soprano from Galicia, has a light,  penetrating, marvelously sweet, and exceedingly flexible voice, with an  almost perfect vocal mechanism. As one of her admirers has said, her  tones are as clear as silver bells, and there is something buoyant and  jubilant in her mode of song. With her"]]]
