The ceremony itself arose out of the  culprit, or man bound, having lost our camels, a circumstance which has  detained us here to-day. The herdsman was thus punished for his neglect;  and so all these African people have an amusing way of turning their  misfortunes into fun, as well as of making a profit out of them. I have  already observed before, that every misfortune we have suffered has been  a benefit to the Kailouees. This has made them so careless about what  might happen to us.    _21st._--Our course was generally nearly south, but often a little  winding. Baghzem was always on our right, until we left it behind us, on  the north-west. This mountain has, probably, been so much celebrated in  all past times, because it is the most conspicuous object on the return  route from the south to the north. Overweg conjectures that it is  granite. He had no servant at hand yesterday to visit it with him, and  he did not like to go alone, because it swarms with lions.    We passed to-day mostly through undulating country, a sort of ground  which, in the Sahara, lies generally between the plateaux and the high  rocky ranges. From one of the lesser heights we had a magnificent view  of Baghzem. We passed also through and along several fine wadys, lined  with ancient trees. Perhaps, in some places, full half of the trees were  decayed, and many only naked stumps. The trees were so thick in certain  places as to deserve the name of forests--primeval forests--but, I  imagine, not to be compared with those of America.    Amongst the trees to-day appeared most conspicuously the doom-palm. This  is the first day we have seen it in such numbers. This \"palm of  Pharaoh,\" as the Moors call it, according to their habit of coupling all  strange things with those ancient monarchs, is found in groups as well  as isolated trees. When isolate, and also when in groups, it very  frequently assumes a double-shaped trunk, or two large arms spread out  or divided from a low stump.[11] Of the leaves, which are called  _gabba_, the people make all their rope.     [11] I believe the trunk of the doom is always thus divided and        subdivided.--ED.    These trees are now laden with fruit, not ripe. The abundance of them  gives to the place of our encampment a truly tropical aspect. We  journeyed on to-day eight hours and a-half--a good, fair day. The  weather was warm, even a little sultry. As to inhabitants, we passed  many isolated huts, but saw no villages in groups. We also passed the  ruins of many villages, whose houses were better built than any I have  yet seen in this part of Aheer. This country has seen its best days; for  the huts which now take the place of these houses, high and well-built  of stone and mud, are, indeed, miserable. Probably these deserted places  are some of the towns whose people were carried off to Bornou in the  recent razzias. At the bottom of most of the wadys to-day, water was  found at a foot depth, though not a copious supply. People were at the  wells in numbers, watering their cattle.    En-Noor paid me another attention to-day, when on camel-back, in  presenting to me a piece of gour-nut. This is considered a very great  compliment. As to the fruit itself, I have not yet acquired the taste;  it is only agreeable if you are thirsty, and after chewing it drink  water.    _22d._--We remain here to-day. It is not so cold as it has been.    I am sorry Madame En-Noor has left off the milk, though I never cease to  send coffee twice a-day. I must now, however, send but once, as my sugar  is getting low.    I observed the beautiful bird's nest which I mentioned the other day. It  is a perfect piece of architecture, far superior to the huts made in  this country. The only apparent deficiency is, that it seems to hang on  nothing, or is suspended sometimes on a slender straw, at other times on  a thin twig. The nest is built of straw inside and outside, but the  inside is of a finer straw. I have not seen the bird who is the  architect of this wonderful piece of mechanism. I observed two species  of parasitical plants, one of which has a slender trunk, and has its  root in the earth; and the other, which is entirely dependent on the  tree over which it spreads for all its support and nourishment. Its  roots are in the very boughs of the tree which bears it. Some of our  blacks, who were carried over the desert when young, and had not seen or  observed this phenomenon before, burst out laughing. These comicalities  of vegetation amused them exceedingly. What excites the serious  attention of cultivated minds often produces only laughter in vulgar and  untutored people. Parasitical plants would be a complete study for the  botanist here. The doom-tree has a smaller and rounder-shaped head than  the common date-palm; the leaves are spread out very like a fan, but I  know not whether the doom is called the fan-shaped palm.    We are to stay at this place some time--there appears to be no hurry. We  shall probably be here three days more. The Sultan of Asoudee is  visiting amongst us, and has concerted with En-Noor that all the  caravans shall go together, in order that no one portion of it shall  arrive before the other in Damerghou, and so get the ghaseb cheaper; as,  of course, the early arrivals generally get the better bargains. At  first I could not understand the reason of our all going together; now  the thing is clear enough.    En-Noor called at my tent in the evening, and was very civil. I got a  little milk afterwards for the tea sent him. The royal family appear now  to be short of milk. I find that his royal highness has in reality only  one wife, who is a slave. In an African point of view, however, even  this is too much. His highness confessed to Overweg that God gave man  his limited time in this as in all things. Had the beating I have  recorded any relation to this bitter reflection?    When the sun is down, the landscape around begins to look like Old  England, the species of trees not being visible. The doom reminds me of  the shorn elms along the hedges.    _23d._--The Sultan of Asoudee sent this morning for powder, and was  thankful for a small quantity. We remained here this day. All the  valleys and country around are called _Unan_. This is also the name of a  well near us, but water is usually obtained by scooping out the sand in  the bed of the valleys, and there are few regular wells; those which are  dug are destroyed as soon as the rain returns. Such alone remain entire  as are out of the reach, or beyond the range of the periodic floods.    _24th._--We were not to come on to-day; but En-Noor changed his mind,  and we journeyed on five hours, up the valley of Unan. The eternal  sameness of the tholukh and doom--for dooms are now in great  numbers--would be wearisome, had we not had so much desert before; but  we are still delighted with the continual occurrence of trees, be they  of what species they may. There is, besides, a great abundance of wild  water-melons, which the people sometimes eat. They are very small, but  hard and sound. The lizard, which almost through the whole desert was  found darting about and around the camels' feet, has now disappeared. It  would be a curious inquiry for a naturalist to endeavour to account for  its disappearance, for the nature of the soil has not so much changed.  The only difference--but perhaps this is great for the lizard--is that  hereabouts occur periodic rains, which deluge the land for a few days in  the year; and during these few days, probably, all the land lizards  found in low places would be destroyed.    This is Christmas-eve; a sorry one for us all! We receive no news but  bad news. For to-day a man came up to us, who said he left Tripoli three  months ago, and that the cholera had been very severe in Tripoli, making  many victims; but he brought no particular news for us. He came by the  way of Ghadamez and Ghat, and yet had heard nothing of our misfortunes  on the frontier. I suppose the people of Ghat had already ceased to talk  about us and our affairs; for here in the desert, as elsewhere, things  are soon forgotten. We saw little of the rest of the caravan _en route_,  but if we ever see the whole of the camels going with us, and the  division of Aghadez, I am quite sure they will never reach the  exaggerated number of 10,000! All numbers are dreadfully exaggerated in  Africa.    _25th._--Christmas-day! My second Christmas day in Africa during this  journey. We have nothing to make a merry day of; but we must try and  cheer ourselves up by the thought that we are still spared, after  passing through so many dangers, and amidst a people naturally hostile  to us, and only softened by fear of the Turks, and by possession of the  goods of the Government, which they have taken one way or other. Yet  some of the people appear of a more kindly nature, and Overweg has  experienced a little hospitality in the huts retired from the road, or  sequestered in the surrounding valleys.    Gracious God! make us all thankful for health and strength: may we ever  praise thy protecting care of us and our mission. For the sake of our  Saviour, born on this day, pardon all our sins; give us grace to lead a  new life, and a most willing mind to receive Jesus as the Lord our  righteousness! O God, have mercy upon all our friends and relations, and  give them the will to receive the Saviour, born on this day, as their  only chance of salvation! O God, have mercy upon Africa, and on all men!    Some musicians came this morning to salute us with a little of their  rough music, a drum and a clarionet. I gave them three rings and a  little sugar. I have very little to bestow, and were I to be more  generous, or to make an effort to give them anything like a Christmas  gift, I should then have all the people upon me, begging everything I  had left. Yesterday I spoke a few "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18560"],[0,"Chopin and Other Musical Essays (#20)"],[1,"occasions; nor would the Pythagoreans have found anyone willing to  believe in their doctrine that music has power to control the  passions. \"They firmly believed,\" says Naumann, \"that sweet harmony  and flowing melody alone were capable of restoring the even balance of  the disturbed mind, and of renewing its harmonious relations with the  world. Playing on the lyre, therefore, formed part of the daily  exercises of the disciples of the renowned philosopher, and none dared  seek his nightly couch without having first refreshed his soul at the  fount of music, nor return to the duties of the day without having  braced his energies with jubilant strains. Pythagoras is said to have  recommended the use of special melodies as antidotal to special  passions, and indeed, it is related of him that on a certain occasion  he, by a solemn air, brought back to reason a youth who, maddened by  love and jealousy, was about setting fire to the house of his  mistress.\"    Similar marvellous powers were ascribed to music by the other nations.  The Chinese have an old saying that \"Music has the power to make  Heaven descend upon earth.\" This art was constantly kept under rigid  supervision by the government, and 354 years before Christ, one of the  Emperors issued a special edict against weak, effeminate music; to  which, therefore, a demoralizing influence was obviously attributed.  The Japanese, we read, likewise \"revere music and connect it with  their idol worship,\" and in olden times it seems to have had even a  political function, for it is said that \"formerly an ambassador, in  addressing a foreign court to which he was accredited, did not speak,  but sang his mission.\" The Hindoos, again, attributed supernatural  power to music. Some melodies had the power, as they believed, to  bring down rain, others to move men and animals, as well as lifeless  objects. The fact that they traced the origin of music to the gods  shows in what esteem they held it; and their quaint story of the  16,000 nymphs and shepherdesses, each of whom invented a new key and  melody in her emulous eagerness to move the heart and win the love of  the handsome young god Krishna, shows that the amorous power of music  was already understood in those days.    Once more, the exalted notions which the ancient Hebrews had of the  dignity and importance of music, is indicated by the fact that,  according to Josephus, the treasures of Solomon's Temple (which was  also a great school of music) included 40,000 harps and psalteries of  pure copper, and 200,000 silver trumpets. In the schools of the  prophets, musical practice was an essential item. During the period of  captivity the Israelites at first gave way to despondency, exclaiming,  \"How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?\" \"But by and by  they would take down their harps again from the willow bows and seek  solace for the sorrows of the long exile in recalling the loved melody  of their native land, and the sacred psalmody of their desolated  temple\" (McClintock and Strong). There was hardly an occasion arising  above the commonplace events of everyday life, when the ancient  Hebrews did not resort to music. Trumpets were used at the royal  proclamations and at the dedication of the Temple. There were doleful  chants for funeral processions; joyous melodies for bridal  processions and banquets; stirring martial strains to incite courage  in battle and to celebrate victories, religious songs, and domestic  music for private recreation and pleasure; and even \"the grape  gatherers sang as they gathered in the vintage, and the wine-presses  were trodden with the shout of a song; the women sang as they toiled  at the mill, and on every occasion the land of the Hebrews, during  their national prosperity, was a land of music and melody.\" And  finally, the therapeutic value of music and its power to stimulate the  creative faculties were recognized. The prophets composed their songs  and uttered their prophecies to the sound of musical instruments, and  David drove out the evil spirit from Saul, as we read in the Bible:  \"And it came to pass when the spirit from God was upon Saul, that  David took a harp and played with his hands. So Saul was refreshed,  and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.\"    The preceding facts sufficiently illustrate the effects of music on  the emotions and morals of ancient and primitive nations. Now, within  the Christian era music has made enormous strides in its evolution as  an art, and it seems therefore reasonable to infer that its emotional  and moral power has also increased. Yet, strange to say, a tendency  has manifested itself of late, in many quarters, to flatly deny the  emotional and moral potency of music. The late Richard Grant White,  for instance, in a series of articles on the Influence of Music, in  \"The Atlantic Monthly,\" comes to the conclusion that \"a fine  appreciation of even the noblest music is not an indication of mental  elevation, or of moral purity, or of delicacy of feeling, or even  (except in music) of refinement of taste.\" \"The greatest, keenest  pleasure of my life,\" he adds, \"is one that may be shared equally with  me by a dunce, a vulgarian, or a villain;\" and he ends by asserting,  dogmatically, that a taste for music has no more to do with our minds  or morals than with our complexions or stature. Dr. Hanslick, the  eminent critic and professor of musical history in the University of  Vienna, goes even farther. \"There can be no doubt,\" he says, \"that  music had a much more direct effect on the ancient nations than it has  on us.\" To-day, \"the feelings of the layman are affected most, those  of an educated artist least, by music.\" \"The moral influence of tones  increases in proportion as the culture of mind and character  decreases. The smaller the resistance offered by culture, the more  does this power strike home. It is well known that _it is on savages  that music exerts its greatest influence_.\"    Let us briefly test these sceptical paradoxes in the light of mediaeval  history and modern biography. Is it only among the ancient and  primitive people, and among the musically uneducated, that the divine  art exerts an emotional influence? St. Jerome evidently did not think  so. He believed, at any rate, that music can exert a _demoralizing_  influence, and he taught that Christian maidens should know nothing of  the lyre and the flute. The eminent divine was guided in this matter  by the same process of illogical reasoning of which, later, the  Puritans were guilty when they banished music from the churches. In  view of the fact that music was used to heighten the charms of wanton  Roman festivities or Pagan rites, St. Jerome condemned the art itself,  ignorant of the fact that music can never be immoral in itself, but  only through evil associations. St. Augustine took a different view of  music from St. Jerome. When he first heard the Christian chant at  Milan he exclaimed: \"Oh, my God! When the sweet voice of the  congregation broke upon mine ear, how I wept over Thy hymns of praise.  The sound poured into mine ears and Thy truth entered my heart. Then  glowed within me the spirit of devotion; tears poured forth, and I  rejoiced.\" Here we have an illustration of how music intensifies and  exalts the emotions of educated men. St. Augustine's devotion \"glowed  within him\" when he heard the music. It is for this power that the  church has always employed music as a hand-maid; and those  ecclesiastics who would to-day banish it arbitrarily from the church,  know not what a valuable ally they are blindly repulsing in these  days of religious scepticism. As Mr. Gladstone very recently remarked:  \"Ever since the time of St. Augustine, I might perhaps say of St.  Paul, the power of music in assisting Christian devotion has been upon  record, and great schools of Christian musicians have attested and  confirmed the union of the art with worship.\"    But the greatest musical enthusiast in the ranks of mediaeval churchmen  was Martin Luther. To judge by the extraordinary influence which music  had on him, Luther must doubtless be classed among the lowest of  savages, if Dr. Hanslick is right in saying that it is on savages that  music exerts its greatest influence. He wrote a special treatise on  music, in which he placed it next to theology. \"Besides theology,\" he  wrote in a letter to the musician Senfel, \"music is the only art  capable of affording peace and joy of the heart like that induced by  the study of the science of divinity. The proof of this is that the  devil, the originator of sorrowful anxieties and restless troubles,  flees before the sound of music almost as much as he does before the  Word of God. This is why the prophets preferred music before all the  other arts ... proclaiming the Word in psalms and hymns.... My heart,  which is full to overflowing, has often been solaced and refreshed by  music when sick and weary.\"    Luther had a good voice and a knowledge of musical composition. He  played the flute and the lute, and in church he introduced  congregational singing, in which the people took an active part in  worship by means of the chorales. It is related that, as a child, he  used to sing with other boys in the street in winter, for his daily  bread, and that on one occasion, Frau Cotta frantically rushed from  her house on hearing his pleading tones, took him in, and gave him a  warm meal. Later in life, when he was an Augustine monk, he often  chased away his melancholy and temptations by playing on his lute, and  the story goes that \"one day, after a self-inflicted chastisement, he  was found in a fainting condition in his cell, and that his cloistered  brethren recalled him to consciousness by soft music, well knowing  that music was the balsam for all wounds of the troubled mind of their  'dear Martinus.'\"    Coming to more recent times, we find that some of the greatest  composers "]]]
