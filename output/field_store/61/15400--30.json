Behold us, however, at Richmond Hill, having safely passed the Slough of  Despond, which the vaunted Yonge Street mud road presents, between the  celebrated hamlet of St. Alban's and the aforesaid hill, one of the  greatest curiosities of which road, near St. Alban's, is the vicinity of  a sort of Mormon establishment, where a fellow of the name of David  Wilson, commonly called David, has set up a Temple of the Davidites,  with Virgins of the Sun, dressed in white, and all the tomfooleries of a  long beard and exclusive sanctity. But America is a fine country for  such knavery. Another curiosity is less pitiable and more natural. It  is Bond Lake, a large narrow sheet of water, on the summit between Lake  Simcoe and Lake Ontario, which has no visible outlet or inlet, and is  therefore, like David Wilson, mysterious, although common sense soon  lays the mystery in both cases bare; one is a freak of Nature concealing  the source and exitus, the other a fraud of man.    The oak ridges, and the stair-like descents of plateau after plateau to  Ontario, are also remarkable enough, showing even to the most  thoughtless that here ancient shores of ancient seas once bounded the  forest, gradually becoming lower and lower as the water subsided. Lyell  visited these with the late Mr. Roy, a person little appreciated and  less understood by the great ones of the earth at Toronto, who made an  excellent geological survey of this part of the province, and whose  widow had infinite difficulty in obtaining a paltry recompense for his  labours in developing the resources of the country. The honey which this  industrious bee manufactured was sucked by drones, and no one has done  him even a shadow of justice, but Mr. Lyell, who, having no colonial  dependence, had no fears in so doing.    But of Richmond Hill, why so called I never could discover, for it is  neither very highly picturesque, nor very highly poetical, although  Dolby's Tavern is a most comfortable resting-place for a wearied  traveller, at which prose writer or poetaster may find a haven.  Attention, good fare, and neatness prevail. It is English.    I have observed two things in journeying through Upper Canada. If you  find neatness at an hostel, it is kept by old-country people. If you  meet with indifference and greasy meats, they are Americans. If you see  the best parlour hung round with bad prints of presidents, looking like  Mormon preachers, they are radicals of the worst leaven. If prints from  the New York Albion, neatly framed and glazed, hang on each side of a  wooden clock, over a sideboard in the centre of the room, opposite to  the windows, the said prints representing Queen Victoria, Lord Nelson,  Windsor Castle, or the New Houses of Parliament, be assured that loyalty  and John Bullism reign there; and, although you meet with no servility,  you will not be disgusted with vulgar assumption, such as cocking up  dirty legs in dirty boots on a dirty stove, wearing the hat, and not  deigning to answer a civil question.    Personally, no man cares less for the mode of reception, when I take  mine ease at mine inn, than I do, for old soldiers are not very  fastidious, and old travellers still less so; but give me sturdy John  Bull, with his blunt plainness and true independence, before the silly  insolence of a fellow, who thinks he shows his equality, by lowering the  character of a man to that of a brute, in coarse exhibitions of assumed  importance, which his vocation of extracting money from his unwilling  guests renders only more hateful.    We departed from Richmond Hill at half-past five, and waggoned on to  Finch's Inn, seven miles, where we breakfasted. This is another  excellent resting-place, and the country between the two is thickly  settled. I forgot to mention that we have now been travelling through  scenes celebrated in the rebellion of Mackenzie. About five miles from  Holland Landing is the Blacksmith's Shop, which was the head-quarters of  Lount, the smith, who, like Jack Cade, set himself up to reform abuses,  and suffered the penalty of the outraged laws.    Lount was a misled person, who, imbued with strong republican feelings,  and forgetting the favours of the government he lived under, which had  made him what he was, took up arms at Mackenzie's instigation, and  thought he had a call--a call to be a great general. He passed to his  account, so '_requiescas in pace_,' Lount! for many a villain yet lives,  to whose vile advices you owed your untimely end, and who ought to have  met with your fate instead of you. Lount had the mind of an honest man  in some things, for it is well known that his counsels curbed the bloody  and incendiary spirit of Mackenzie in many instances. The government  has not sequestered his property, although his sons were equally guilty  with himself.    We also pass, in going to Toronto, two other remarkable places. Finch's  Tavern, where we breakfasted at seven o'clock, was formerly the Old  Stand, as it was so called, of the notorious Montgomery, another  general, a tavern general of Mackenzie's, who moved to a place about  four miles from the city, where the rebels were attacked in 1837 by Sir  Francis Head, and near which the battle of Gallows Hill was fought.    Montgomery was taken prisoner, sent to Kingston, and escaped by  connivance, with several others, from the fortress there on a dark  night, fell into a ditch, broke his leg, and afterwards was hauled by  his comrades over a high wall, and got across the St. Lawrence into the  United States, where he was run over afterwards by a waggon and much  injured. His tavern was burnt to the ground by the militia during the  action, on account of the barbarous murder there of Colonel Moodie, a  very old retired officer, who was killed by Mackenzie's orders in cold  blood. It is now rebuilt on a very extensive scale; and he is again  there, having been permitted to return, and his property, which was  confiscated, has been restored to his creditors.    Such were Mackenzie's intended government and the tools he was to govern  by! Such is the British government! The Upper Canadians wisely preferred  the latter.    Next to Richmond Hill is Thornhill, all on the macadamized portion of  the road to Toronto. Thornhill is a very pretty place, with a neat  church and a dell, in which a river must formerly have meandered, but  where now a streamlet runs to join Lake Ontario. Here are extensive  mills, owned by Mr. Thorne, a wealthy merchant, who exports flour  largely, the Yonge Street settlement being a grain country of vast  extent, which not only supplies his mills, but the Red Mills, near  Holland Landing, and many others.    From Montgomery's Tavern to Toronto is almost a continued series for  four miles of gentlemen's seats and cottages, and, being a straight  road, you see the great lake for miles before its shores are reached.  Large sums have been expended on this road, which is carried through a  brick-clay soil, in which the Don has cut deep ravines, so that immense  embankments and deep excavations for the level have been requisite.    Near Toronto, at Blue Hill, large brick yards are in operation, and here  white brick is now made, of which a handsome specimen of church  architecture has been lately erected in the west end of the city. Tiles,  elsewhere not seen in Canada, are also manufactured near Blue Hill; but  they are not extensively used, the snow and high winds being  unfavourable to their adoption, shingles or split wood being cheaper,  and tinned iron plates more durable and less liable to accident.    In most parts of Upper Canada, near the shores of the great lakes, you  can build a house either of stone or brick, as it suits your fancy, for  both these materials are plentiful, particularly clay; but at Toronto  there is no suitable building-stone; plenty of clay, however, is found,  for there you may build your house out of the very excavations for your  cellars; and I confess that I prefer a brick house in Canada to one of  limestone, for the latter material imbibes moisture; and if a brick  house has a good projecting roof, it lasts very long, and is always  warm.    It is surprising to observe the effects of the climate on buildings in  this country. A good stone house, not ten years old, carefully built,  and pointed between the joints of the masonry with the best cement,  requires a total repair after that period, and often before. The  window-sills and lintels of limestone break and crack, and the chimneys  soon become disjointed and unsafe. Although it may seem paradoxical, yet  it is true that the woodwork of a house lasts good much longer than the  stone, or rather the cement, which joins the stone; but wood decays  also very rapidly. A bridge becomes rotten in ten years, and a shingled  roof lasts only fifteen; but then wood is never seasoned in America; it  would not pay.          CHAPTER VII.

Behold us again in Toronto at Macdonald's Hotel; and, as we shall have  to visit this rising city frequently, we shall say very little more  about it at present, but embark as speedily as possible on board the  Transit, and steam over to Niagara.    The Transit, a celebrated packet, now getting old, and commanded by a  son of its well-known owner, Captain Richardson, starts always in summer  at eight a.m. punctually, and makes her voyage by half-past eleven, at  which hour,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#20)"],[1,"to      assist the Spanish Government, and for the method in which      that force had been organised. The amendment was lost by a      majority of 36, on 19th April.]        [Footnote 36: The Irish Municipal Bill, to convert      Corporations of Municipalities into Electoral Councils, was      introduced in the House of Commons on the 15th of February.      The Bill was opposed by the Conservatives, but passed the      House of Commons. In the Lords an amendment of Lyndhurst's      struck out the constructive clauses, and the Act became, on      the 18th of May, an Act for the Abolition of Municipalities      in Ireland. Lord John Russell brought forward a motion to      reconstruct the Bill. But the Peers declined to pass it, and      it was postponed.]        [Footnote 37: As Ministers only obtained a majority of 5 in a      house of 569, the measure was dropped.]          _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    LAEKEN, _28th April 1837._    ... I hope you occupy yourself with the several great questions which  agitate parties. I think a good mode will be to talk concerning them  sometimes with the Dean. He is a good moderate man, and still well  able to give you sufficient information. From conversation with clever  people, such as dine sometimes with you, much may be very usefully  gathered, and you will do well to attend to this. I am no enemy to  this way of instruction, and have seen people who were sharp enough  to profit wonderfully by it. You hear in this way the opinions of a  variety of persons, and it rests with your own good sense to classify  and appreciate them....          [Pageheading: MINISTERIAL ANXIETY]      _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _2nd May 1837._    ... You may depend upon it that I shall profit by your excellent  advice respecting Politics. Pray, dear Uncle, have you read Lord  Palmerston's speech concerning the Spanish affairs,[38] which he  delivered the night of the division on Sir Henry Hardinge's motion? It  is much admired. The Irish Tithes question came on last night in the  House of Commons,[39] and I am very anxious for the morning papers,  to see what has been done. Lord Melbourne looks remarkably well, Lord  Palmerston not very well, and as for poor little Lord John Russell,  he is only a shadow of himself. It must be dreadfully fagging work for  them; they sit so very late too, for when the Spanish question came  on, the division only took place at four o'clock in the morning, and I  saw them at the Drawing-Room the same day afterwards....        [Footnote 38: Lord Palmerston indignantly asked whether      England should continue to fulfil her engagement with the      Queen of Spain, or disgracefully abandon an ally whom she had      pledged herself to succour.]        [Footnote 39: The Irish Tithe Bill, a measure to facilitate      the collection of tithes, was abandoned because the Tories      would not consent to any secular appropriation of Church      revenues, and the Whigs would not consent to the withdrawal      of their amendments. A remarkable feature in the Bill was a      proposal that a portion of every clergyman's income should be      applied to education, as was already prescribed by a former      Act.]          _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _9th May 1837._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--It was very kind of you to write to me from your  new chateau; I hardly ventured to hope for my usual letter, and yet I  should have been much disappointed had I not received it. I am sorry  that the house is so bad, but hope you will have found a good position  for a new one....    Pray, dearest Uncle, may I ask such an indiscreet question as, if  Major Stroekens is a clever man; he was so nervous and embarrassed  when he came here, that I could not make him out. He brought me a very  nice letter from Donna Maria.    I am anxiously waiting to hear the issue of the battle between  the Carlists and Christinos, which is, they say, to decide a great  deal.[40]    Now farewell, dearest Uncle. I beg my affectionate love to my dear  Aunt, and my most respectful _hommages_ to the Members of the Family  with you. Believe me, always, your affectionate Niece,    VICTORIA.    Old Pozzo[41] dined here last Wednesday, and he gave me a long, I  must say clever, dissertation about the state of France, during  dinner-time.        [Footnote 40: After an obstinate investment by the Carlists,      Espartero had relieved Bilbao on Christmas Day, 1836. The      Christino commanders then began to concert a combined      movement on the Carlist lines, which stretched from Irun to      Villafranca.]        [Footnote 41: Count Pozzo di Borgo (1764-1842), Russian      Ambassador.

He was Ambassador in      London for two years, when his health gave way.]          [Pageheading: THE PRINCESS'S ESTABLISHMENT]      _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    LAEKEN, _25th May 1837._    MY DEAREST CHILD,--You have had some battles and difficulties of which  I am completely in the dark. The thing I am most curious to learn  is what the King proposed to you concerning your establishment....  I shall reserve my opinion till I am better informed, but by what  I heard I did not approve of it, because I thought it ill-timed.  Stockmar will be able to do much. Two things seem necessary; not to be  fettered by any establishment other than what will be _comfortable  to you_, and then to avoid any breach with your mother. I have  fully instructed Stockmar, and I must say he left me in such good  disposition that I think he will be able to be of great use to you.  The great thing is to act without precipitation and with caution. The  King seems better again. I am very curious to know what he proposed;  you will have it in your power to modify his proposition, as it is  difficult your _approbation_ should be dispensed with; it would be a  great fault in your situation to _submit_ to this.... They seemed to  think the King dying, which does not appear to be the case. Be steady,  my good child, and _not_ put out by _anything_; as long as I live _you  will not want a faithful friend and supporter_....    Here your somewhat curious little soul has at least the outlines of  things....    _26th._--I received yesterday the whole of the papers concerning the  King's propositions.[42] I approve your letter to the King, as it  is amiable and generous, and this in your position will always tell  favourably. I think that if _he_ is well advised he will chiefly  consult _your wishes_. This is the footing on which you must place  matters. It is not worth while to be told that one is in some sort  of age when the consequence is that you are not consulted in what  concerns you most personally. Avoid in future to say much about  your great _youth_ and _inexperience_. Who made the letter? Was it  yourself, or came it from your Mother? You have now the Baron at your  elbow, and even your Mother was most anxious for his arrival. _Speak  sometimes with him_; it is necessary to accustom you to the thing.    About the King's health.[43] I am doubtful what to think. We have  foreseen the case and treated it formerly. The great thing would be to  make no change, to keep Ministers and everything as it is, and to gain  time; in this way _no one is hurt and no amour-propre blesse_.  For this reason I lean to your keeping, to begin with, Sir Herbert  Taylor[44] for your _official_ secretary, though I am not quite  _decided_ on the subject. He knows the manner in which the _daily  business_ is carried on; this is important. I believe him, and have  found him to be an honest man, that would do for State matters; it  would not be required that he should be your _confidential_ adviser.  Now I conclude, and send you this letter through Stockmar. My best  regards to Lehzen. Ever your faithful Uncle and Friend,    LEOPOLD R.        [Footnote 42: The King had offered the Princess an      establishment of L10,000 a year, independent of her mother.      This was accepted, to the great vexation of the Duchess of      Kent, but the arrangement was not carried into effect.]        [Footnote 43: King William's health was at this time causing      much anxiety.]        [Footnote 44: Private Secretary to King William IV.]          [Pageheading: BIRTHDAY REJOICINGS]      _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _26th May 1837._    ... The demonstrations of affection and kindness from all sides  towards me on my birthday, were most gratifying. The parks and streets  were crowded all day as though something very extraordinary had  happened. Yesterday I received twenty-two Addresses from various  places, all very pretty and loyal; one in particular was very well  written which was presented by Mr. Attwood[45] from the Political  Union at Birmingham.    I am delighted to hear Stockmar is at length arrived; he reached  London on Wednesday, and we shall see him to-day.    How distressed I am that poor dear Ernest[46] has been so ill! Thank  God! that he is now better.    The Spanish affairs have turned out better than you had expected; the  triumphant capture of Irun[47] was a great thing for the Christinos.    The King is much better.        [Footnote 45: Thomas Attwood founded in 1829 the Birmingham Political      Union, which helped to pass the Reform Act. Previously he had been      known for his opposition to the Orders in Council, and the resumption      of cash payments.
