At this moment the Indians who attended them gave the alarm that a  tiger was approaching. The Indians mounted a tree, and the party in the  cave blocked up the mouth of it with a large and heavy stone, which  fortunately lay near. A dreadful roar was heard, which was replied to by  the growling of the two cubs, and the flaming eyes of a tremendous tiger  were seen glowing with fury between the top of the stone and the rock  just above it. The tiger attempted to remove the stone, but his  prodigious strength was unequal to the attempt, and he howled more  tremendously than before. Several of the party had leveled their muskets  and pistols at the head of the tiger, through the narrow opening left by  the stone; but the storm had damped the powder, and the pieces could not  be discharged. The young cubs were then killed and thrust through the  hole to the tiger on the outside, who, after turning them over and  examining them, broke afresh into the wildest fury. The Indians  discharged several arrows at the infuriated animal, but his thick skin  repelled them. The storm ceased, and the thunder was heard only in the  distance, but the tiger laid himself down at the mouth of the cave. In a  short time a roar was heard near, which was answered by the tiger, who  sprang up directly on his feet. The Indians in the tree gave a wild  shriek, as a tigress bounded toward the cave. The howling of the two  animals, after the tigress had examined her cubs, was truly terrible,  and every one in the cavern gave himself over for lost. A powder-flask,  containing their whole stock of gunpowder, had been upset in turning out  the young cubs, so that they were reduced to despair. The tigress, after  staring wildly at the stone at the opening of the cavern, sprang against  it with all her force, and would probably have displaced it, had not the  party joined together to hold it in its place. Suddenly the two tigers  turned their heads toward the forest, and disappeared. The Indians  descended the tree, and urged the party in the cave to take the  opportunity of escaping, for that the tigers had ascended the heights to  find another way into the cave. No time was to be lost; they hurried  through the forest till they came to a wide chasm with a rushing stream  below it. A bridge of reeds had been thrown across the chasm, and over  this bridge they passed, but the tigers were close in pursuit. The last  of the party who crossed the bridge cut the fastenings which tied it to  the rock, and hoped by this means to secure safety, when the tigress  rushed toward the chasm, made a spring, and fell down upon the pointed  rocks below, and from thence into the torrent at the bottom. It was a  fearful sight to see this ferocious animal for a moment in the air,  without knowing whether she would be able to clear the chasm. The tiger  paused not a moment, but making an amazing spring, reached the opposite  side with his fore paws. As he clung to the rock, one of the party  plunged his sword into the breast of the furious beast, while another  struck him a blow on the head with the butt-end of his gun. The tiger  let go his hold, and fell back into the abyss. This was a dreadful  moment! for the man who struck the tiger on the head could not recover  himself; he reeled over the edge of the fearful precipice, stretched out  his hand in vain to seize hold of something with which to save himself,  and then was precipitated into the horrid gulf below!    A novel exhibition was presented in the city of Boston, not long ago,  which attracted the attention of every body, old and young. Herr  Driesbach, the famous tamer of wild animals, made his appearance in an  elegant sleigh, with his pet tiger by his side. In this manner he rode  through the streets. The tiger, it is said, seemed to enjoy the  sleighing mightily, and leaped upon his master, from time to time,  licking his face, and showing other signs of excitement. Driesbach had  to strike him several times, to keep him from making too enthusiastic  demonstrations. After astonishing the citizens for a considerable time,  Driesbach alighted at his hotel, with his tiger, and taking him into one  of the apartments, invited gentlemen to walk in and be introduced,  though there were very few who seemed willing to avail themselves of the  privilege.    [Illustration: CHAPTER END DECORATION]          [Illustration: THE RHINOCEROS.]      The Rhinoceros.      From the accounts of those who are best acquainted with the rhinoceros,  it appears that the animal is tamed only with great difficulty, and  never to such an extent that it is always safe to approach him. Sir  Everard Home gives the following account of one in a menagerie in  London: \"He was so savage, that about a month after he came, he  endeavored to kill the keeper, and nearly succeeded. He ran at him with  the greatest fury; but, fortunately, the horn of the animal passed  between the keeper's thighs, and threw him on the head of the  rhinoceros. The horn struck a wooden partition, into which it was forced  to such a depth, that the animal, for a minute, was unable to withdraw  it; and during this interval, the man escaped. By discipline, the  keeper afterward got the management of him; but frequently, more  especially in the middle of the night, fits of phrensy came on, and  while these lasted, nothing could control his rage. He ran, with great  swiftness, round his den, playing all kinds of antics, making hideous  noises, breaking every thing to pieces, and disturbing the whole  neighborhood. While this fit was on, the keeper never dared to come near  him.\"    When the rhinoceros is quietly pursuing his way through his favorite  glades of mimosa bushes (which his hooked upper lip enables him readily  to seize, and his powerful grinders to masticate), his horns, fixed  loosely in his skin, make a clapping noise by striking one against the  other; but on the approach of danger, if his quick ear or keen scent  makes him aware of the vicinity of a hunter, the head is quickly raised,  and the horns stand stiff, and ready for combat on his terrible front.  The rhinoceros is often accompanied by a sentinel, to give him  warning--a beautiful green-backed and blue-winged bird, about the size  of a jay--which sits on one of his horns.    The following account of the perils of a party hunting for the  rhinoceros is given by Mr. Bruce, a traveler of celebrity: \"We were on  horseback, at the dawn of the day, in search of the rhinoceros; and  after having searched about an hour in the thickest part of the forest,  one of these animals rushed out with great violence, and crossed the  plain toward a thicket of canes, at the distance of nearly two miles.  But though he ran, or rather trotted, with surprising speed, considering  his bulk, he was in a short time pierced with thirty or forty javelins.  This attack so confounded him, that he left his purpose of going to the  thicket, and ran into a deep ravine, without outlet, breaking about a  dozen of the javelins as he entered. Here we thought he was caught in a  trap--for he had scarcely room to turn--and a servant, who had a gun,  standing directly over him, fired at his head. The animal fell  immediately, to all appearance dead. All those on foot now jumped into  the ravine, to cut him up. But they had scarcely begun, when the animal  recovered himself so far as to rise upon his knees; and he would  undoubtedly have destroyed several of the men, had not one of them, with  great presence of mind, cut the sinew of the animal's hind leg. To this  precaution they were indebted, under God, for their lives.\"    The rhinoceros and the elephant have been known to engage in a pitched  battle, in which case the former always comes off victor. The combat,  however, is a very furious one.    There are two species of the rhinoceros. The one which is represented in  the engraving is the double-horned rhinoceros. It is perhaps the largest  of land animals, with the exception of the elephant. When pursued,  notwithstanding its large, unwieldy body, it can run with astonishing  swiftness.    [Illustration: CHAPTER END DECORATION]          The Alligator.      On the whole, though the alligator can hardly claim any attention from  us in these stories, owing to his manner of locomotion, and some other  circumstances, yet I think I will introduce him to the reader, as I have  two or three anecdotes about his tribe, which are worth reading, and as  he comes within the qualifications for introduction to our present  company of animals, so far as to possess the specific number of  locomotive organs.    A British medical officer, many years a resident in the East Indies,  relates the following painful incident: \"A native, being employed in  repairing a ship lying in the Bengal river, carelessly put his legs off  the stage upon which he was seated, at the side of the vessel, and  being engaged in conversation with his wife and child, who were on  board, forgot the danger of his situation. As he proceeded in his  labors, it was necessary to lower the stage, until it came within a few  feet only of the water. He had not been in this position many minutes,  when a monstrous alligator rose suddenly above the surface of the river,  and before the poor man perceived the animal, seized one of his legs,  snapped it off, just above the knee, and descended into the water. The  man then tried to get on board the ship, but in vain. The pain, the  terror, the loss of his limb, so entirely prostrated his strength, that  all his efforts were useless. The wife hung terror-stricken over the  side of the vessel, not knowing what to do, calling for assistance, and  shrieking distractedly. The boy, with more presence of mind, clung to  his father, and endeavored, with all his little strength, to lift him  up. The cries of the woman at length brought some persons to ascertain  what "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18779"],[0,"Physiology and Hygiene for Secondary Schools (#20)"],[1,"uses, however, are  of minor importance when compared with _the main use of oxygen_, which _is  that of an aid in supplying energy to the body_.    *Oxygen and the Maintenance of Life.*--In the supplying of energy to the  body, one of the conditions necessary to the maintenance of life is  provided. Because oxygen is necessary to this process, and because death  quickly results when the supply of it is cut off, oxygen is frequently  called the supporter of life. This idea is misleading, for oxygen has no  more to do with the maintenance of life than have the food materials with  which it unites. Life appears to be more dependent upon oxygen than upon  food, simply because the supply of it in the body at any time is  exceedingly small. Being continually surrounded by an atmosphere  containing free oxygen, the body depends upon this as a constant source of  supply, and does not store it up. Food, on the other hand, is taken in  excess of the body's needs and stored in the various tissues, the supply  being sufficient to last for several days. When the supply of either  oxygen or food is exhausted in the body, life must cease.    *The Oxygen Movement a Necessity.*--Since _free_ oxygen is required for  keeping up the chemical changes in the cells, and since it ceases to be  free as soon as it goes into combination, its continuous movement through  the body is a necessity. The oxygen compounds must be removed as fast as  formed in order to make room for more free oxygen. This movement has  already been studied in connection with the blood and the organs of  respiration, but the consideration of certain details has been deferred  till now. By what means and in what form is the oxygen passed _to_ and  _from_ the cells?    *Passage of Oxygen through the Blood.*--In serving its purpose at the  cells, the oxygen passes twice through the blood--once as it goes toward  the cells and again as it passes from the cells to the exterior of the  body:    _Passage toward the Cells._--This is effected mainly through the hemoglobin  of the red corpuscles. At the lungs the oxygen and the hemoglobin form a  weak chemical compound that breaks up and liberates the oxygen when it  reaches the capillaries in the tissues. The separation of the oxygen from  the hemoglobin at the tissues appears to be due to two causes: first, to  the weakness of the chemical attraction between the atoms of oxygen and  the atoms that make up the hemoglobin molecule; and second, to a  difference in the so-called _oxygen pressure_ at the lungs and at the  tissues.(46)    The attraction of the oxygen and the hemoglobin is sufficient to cause  them to unite where the oxygen pressure is more than one half pound to the  square inch, but it is not sufficiently strong to cause them to unite or  to prevent their separation, if already united, where the oxygen pressure  is less than one half pound to the square inch. The oxygen pressure at the  lungs, which amounts to nearly three pounds to the square inch, easily  causes the oxygen and the hemoglobin to unite, while the almost complete  absence of any oxygen pressure at the tissues, permits their separation.  The blood in its circulation constantly flows from the place of high  oxygen pressure at the lungs to the place of low oxygen pressure at the  tissues and, in so doing, loads up with oxygen at one place and unloads it  at the other (Fig. 55).    _Passage from the Cells._--Since oxygen leaves the free state at the cells  and becomes a part of compounds, we are able to trace it from the body  only by following the course of these compounds. Three waste compounds of  importance are formed at the cells--carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and  urea (N2H4CO). The first is formed by the union of oxygen with carbon, the  second by its union with hydrogen, and the third by its union with  nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon. These compounds are carried by the blood  to the organs of excretion, where they are removed from the body. The  water leaves the body chiefly as a liquid, the urea as a solid dissolved  in water, and the carbon dioxide as a gas. The passage of carbon dioxide  through the blood requires special consideration.                                    [Fig. 55]         Fig. 55--*Diagram illustrating movement, of oxygen and carbon dioxide    through the body* (S.D. Magers). Each moves from a place of relatively           high to a place of relatively low pressure. (See text.)      *Passage of Carbon Dioxide through the Blood.*--Part of the carbon dioxide  is dissolved in the plasma of the blood, and part of it is in weak  chemical combination with substances found in the plasma and in the  corpuscles. Its passage through the blood is accounted for in the same way  as the passage of the oxygen. Its ability to dissolve in liquids and to  enter into chemical combination varies as the _carbon dioxide  pressure_(47) This in turn varies with the amount of the carbon dioxide,  which is greatest at the cells (where it is formed), less in the blood,  and still less in the lungs. Because of these differences, the blood is  able to take it up at the cells and release it at the lungs (Fig. 55).                                    [Fig. 56]      Fig. 56--*Soap bubble* floating in a vessel of carbon dioxide, illustrating         the difference in weight between air and carbon dioxide gas.      *Properties of Carbon Dioxide.*--Carbon dioxide is a colorless gas with  little or no odor. It is classed as a heavy gas, being about one third  heavier than air(48) (Fig. 56). It does not support combustion, but on the  contrary is used to some extent to extinguish fires. It is formed by the  oxidation of carbon in the body, and by the combustion of carbon outside  of the body. It is also formed by the decay of animal and vegetable  matter. From these sources it is continually finding its way into the  atmosphere. Although not a poisonous gas, carbon dioxide may, if it  surround the body, shut out the supply of oxygen and cause death.(49)    *Final Disposition of Carbon Dioxide.*--It is readily seen that the union  of carbon and oxygen, which is continually removing oxygen from the air  and replacing it with carbon dioxide, tends to make the whole atmosphere  deficient in the one and to have an excess of the other. This tendency is  counteracted through the agency of vegetation. Green plants absorb the  carbon dioxide from the air, decompose it, build the carbon into compounds  (starch, etc.) that become a part of the plant, and return the free oxygen  to the air (Fig. 57). In doing this, they not only preserve the necessary  proportion of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but also put  the carbon and oxygen in such a condition that they can again unite. The  force which enables the plant cells to decompose the carbon dioxide is  supplied by the sunlight (Chapter XII).                                    [Fig. 57]      Fig. 57--*Under surface* of a geranium leaf showing breathing pores, highly                              magnified (O.H.).      *Summary.*--Oxygen, by uniting with materials at the cells, keeps up a  condition of chemical activity (oxidation) in the body. This supplies heat  and the other forms of bodily energy. Entering as a free element, oxygen  leaves the body as a part of the waste compounds which it helps to form.  The free oxygen is transported from the lungs to the cells by means of the  hemoglobin of the red corpuscles, while the combined oxygen in carbon  dioxide and other compounds from the cells is carried mainly by the  plasma. The limited supply of free oxygen in the body at any time makes  necessary its continuous introduction into the body.    *Exercises.*--1. Describe the properties of oxygen. How does it unite with  other elements? How does it support combustion?    2. State the purpose of oxygen in the body. What properties enable it to  fulfill this purpose?    3. What is the proof that oxygen does not remain permanently in the body?  How does the oxygen entering the body differ from the same oxygen as it  leaves the body?    4. What is the necessity for the _continuous_ introduction of oxygen into  the body, while food is introduced only at intervals?    5. How are the red corpuscles able to take up and give off oxygen? How is  the plasma able to take up and give off carbon dioxide?    6. If thirty cubic inches of air pass from the lungs at each expiration  and 4.5 per cent of this is carbon dioxide, calculate the number of cubic  feet of the gas expelled in twenty-four hours, estimating the number of  respirations at eighteen per minute.    7. What is the weight of this volume of carbon dioxide, if one cubic foot  weigh 1.79 ounces?    8. What portion of this weight is oxygen and what carbon, the ratio by  weight of carbon to oxygen in carbon dioxide being twelve to thirty-two?    9. What is the final disposition of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?        PRACTICAL WORK      *To show the Difference between Free Oxygen and Oxygen in  Combination.*--Examine some crystals of potassium chlorate (KClO3). They  contain oxygen _in combination_ with potassium and chlorine. Place a few  of these in a small test tube and heat strongly in a gas or alcohol flame.  The crystals first melt, and the liquid which they form soon appears to  boil. If a splinter, having a spark on the end, is now inserted in the  tube, it is kindled into a flame. This shows the presence of _free_  oxygen, the heat having caused the potassium chlorate to decompose. The  difference between free and combined oxygen may also be shown by  decomposing other compounds of oxygen, such as water and mercuric oxide.    *Preparation and Properties of Oxygen.*--Intimately mix 3 grams (1/2  teaspoonful) of potassium chlorate with half its bulk of manganese  dioxide, and place the mixture in a large test tube. Close the test tube  with a tight-fitting stopper which bears a glass tube of sufficient length  and of the right shape"]]]
