Birds of brilliant feathering were  shot, skinned, preserved with arsenical paste, filled with cotton wool,  and laid to dry with their heads and shoulders thrust into paper cones,  after which they were transferred to a box which had to be zealously  watched to keep out the ants.  Certainly scores of these were killed  through eating the poison smeared upon the skins, but that was little  satisfaction if they had first destroyed some delicate bird.    Butterflies, too, and beetles were obtained in great numbers, being  carefully killed, and pinned out in boxes lined with camphored cork.  These insects the two Zulu boys soon learned to capture with the  greatest ease, and after a little teaching they would bring in a  handsome butterfly or moth, without crushing and disfiguring it first so  that it was useless for preservation.    Bok or antelope of various kinds were plentiful enough to make the party  sure of plenty of food; and both Dick and Jack were getting so skilful  with the rifle that they could be depended upon to bring down a koodoo  or springbok at four or five hundred paces.    The kraal had been strengthened, so that they felt no fear of a lion  getting through; but fires were kept up every night, wood being  plentiful, and the bright glow seemed to give confidence to the  occupants of the camp, as well as to the horses and oxen.  Watch was  kept too, but though lions were sometimes heard at a distance they did  not molest the travellers, and but for the stern suggestions of the  General they would have grown careless in the extreme.    For experience and skill in the use of fire-arms made Dick and Jack more  confident.  They had looked upon a lion as a monster of such prowess,  and of so dangerous a character, that they were quite surprised at the  ease with which a good shot with a rifle could hold the king of beasts  at his mercy.    As for Coffee and Chicory, the General several times punished them for  being so daring and running such risks, especially as they were in a  part of the country where lions really were plentiful, although, so far,  little molestation of the travellers had taken place.    It had been decided that upon the next day they would trek onward for  some distance, and perhaps on and on for days, according to the  attractiveness of the country they were passing through, and the  plentifulness of the game.    The General heard Mr Rogers' decision with a smile of satisfaction.    \"I want to take you where the great tusker elephants are,\" he said, \"and  let you shoot the giraffe and rhinoceros.  We have hardly begun yet.\"    He made the boys' eyes glow with excitement as he told them of the size  of the hippopotami and elephants they would encounter, the height of the  giraffes, and the furious nature of the rhinoceros, which beast seemed  to be always mad if it saw a human being.    As they were going to start next day it was decided to let the horses  graze in peace with the oxen, which, after a fortnight's rest, looked  sleek-coated and in far better condition; but Peter, Dirk, and Dinny  were bidden to keep a strict watch over the cattle, for just before  starting the General announced that he had seen a lion-spoor, apparently  two days old.    The day was passed very pleasantly, collecting, by Mr Rogers and his  sons, several very beautiful birds falling to their guns, and their  boxes being filled with splendidly burnished beetles; and at last tired  out, they turned to get back to the little camp by midday, hoping to  find a satisfactory meal ready, for the General had gone out with a  rifle in search of a bok; and his two boys had taken their kiris and  assegais, to see if they could not knock down a few of the large  partridge or quail-like birds.    What was their disappointment then to find that neither the General nor  his sons had returned, while Dinny was in great distress.    \"Sure,\" he said, \"I thought I'd take a fishing-line and a shtick, and go  to the big pool by the little river over yonder, and catch a few of the  fish things; bad cess to 'em, they're no more like the fine salmon and  throut of my own country than this baste of a place is its aiqual.\"    \"Well, Dinny, and you went and didn't catch anything,\" said Dick.    \"Sure, Masther Dick, an' you weren't there,\" said Dinny; \"but ye're  right there; I didn't catch a single fish, for the little gintlemen  wouldn't let me.\"    \"Little gentlemen, Dinny?\" said Mr Rogers eagerly.  \"Did you see any  natives?\"    \"An' is it natives ye'd call the dirthy undersized little craytures?\"  cried Dinny indignantly.  \"Sure I'd take a couple of 'em up under my  arms and run away wid 'em.\"    \"But you say they interfered with you, and wouldn't let you fish,\" said  Mr Rogers.    \"Faix, sor, an' that's what they did.  Ye know the big pool.\"    \"To be sure,\" said Mr Rogers.  \"There are silurus in it.\"    \"Are there though, sor?\" said Dinny.  \"And there's the big rocks up  behind it, where the prickly trees wid red flowers and no leaves at all  grow.\"    \"Yes, I know the place,\" said Mr Rogers impatiently; \"go on.\"    \"Well, sor, I sits meself down comfortable, baits my hook wid a nice bit  of fresh mate as any dacent fish would like to have, and then I says to  meself, `Dinny,' I says, `while ye're waiting to hook a nice fish for  the masther's dinner, I'd have jist a whiff o' tibakky if I were you.'  `Ye're right and I will,' I says; and I outs wid my pipe, fills it, and  was just going to light up, when _splash_!  There was a great big stone  thrown in the wather.    \"`Ah, be aisy, Masther Jack,' I says, for I knew it was you.\"    \"Why, I was away with my father,\" cried Jack.    \"To be sure ye were, Masther Jack, dear; but don't ye see I thought it  was your thrick; and bang comes another big stone down be me side.    \"`I'll tell the masther if ye don't lave off,' I says.  `That's you,  Masther Dick, as throwed that.'    \"Splash comes another, and then I recklected as ye'd both be far away,  and that it must be one of them dirthy little varmints, Coffee or  Chicory.  So I lays down me rod and line, as nice and sthrait a rod as  ye'd cut out of the woods anywhere, ye know, sor, and I picked up my bit  of stick ready for them.    \"`I'll wait till ye throw again, me beauties,' I says; and just as I  says it to meself, a big stone hits me on the back, and another goes in  just by me line.    \"`Now ye shall have it, ye wicked little villains,' I says; and jumping  up I was going to run at 'em, when, murther! there was about a dozen of  the craytures coming down from the rocks, shouting and chattering, and  throwing stones.    \"`Will ye be off?' says one, `ye've no business fishing there widout  lave.'\"    \"How do you know he said that?\" said Dick dryly.    \"Sure an' what else would he say, Masther Dick, dear?  An' ah, ye never  saw such ugly little divils, widout a bit of nose to their dirty faces,  and a grin as if they were all teeth.    \"`Sure I was only catching a fish for the masther's dinner, gintlemen,'  I says, when, murther! if they didn't run at me like mad, and if I  hadn't walked away I belave they'd have killed me.  As it was one  cowardly villain instead of hitting me dacently on the head wid his  stick like a Christian, comes at me and bites me in the leg.\"    \"Let's look, Dinny,\" said Dick, for Mr Rogers listened but did not  speak.    \"Oh ye can look, Masther Dick.  He tuk a pace out of me throusis, and  he'd have tuk a pace out of me leg as well, if I hadn't expostulated wid  him on the head wid me shtick.  Sure I was obliged to run then or they'd  have torn me to pieces; and it's my belafe they've been using the  fishing-line ever since.\"    \"And so you've had an interview with the natives, have you, Dinny?\" said  Mr Rogers dryly.    \"Ah, I wouldn't call them natives, sor,\" said Dinny.    \"What then, baboons?\" said Mr Rogers.    \"Sure, sur, I don't know the name of the thribe, but they're a  dirthy-looking little lot, and as hairy as if they never shaved  themselves a bit.\"    \"Why he's been pelted by monkeys,\" cried Dick, indignantly; and Jack  burst out laughing.    \"Faix, Masther Dick, dear, they behaved like monkeys more than men, and  they're an ugly little thribe of natives; and if I'd had a gun I'd have  given some of them the headache, that I would.\"    \"Ah, here's the General,\" cried Mr Rogers, as the great Zulu came  striding up with a bok over his shoulder.    As he entered the little camp he threw down the bok, and began to skin  it, looking about for Coffee and Chicory.    \"Where are the boys?\" he said at last.    \"Sure they haven't come back,\" said Dinny; \"and I hope they never will,\"  he added, taking the bok to cut up and cook a portion, for Dinny's leg  was very sore and bleeding from a severe bite, and his temper was also a  little more sore from the doubt with which his story had been received.    The Zulu darted a fierce glance at him, but he did not speak.  He only  walked to the waggon, where Mr Rogers was examining some of the  specimens he had killed, and said simply,--    \"May I take the rifle, boss, and go and find my boys?\"    \"Yes, of course,\" exclaimed Mr Rogers.    \"I'll go with you, General,\" cried Jack eagerly.    \"But you are too tired,\" said his father.    \"Oh, no,\" cried Jack.  \"I don't mind.  I'll go with the General.\"    The Zulu darted a grateful look at Jack, and the latter took his rifle  and bullet cartridges, starting off directly after in the way that the  boys had been seen to go.    Jack began chatting to the Zulu as they went along, but after a few  remarks he noticed that the General was very quiet and reserved, while  when he glanced at his countenance it looked so strange that Jack felt  startled, and began to think of how awkward his position would be if the  Zulu were to prove unfaithful, and turn upon him.    But the next minute he was reassured, and found that it was anxiety upon  the General's part about his boys.    \"I am afraid, Boss Jack,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21381"],[0,"Stories Of Ohio (#20)"],[1,"he could for  peace. When he came to Ohio, he dwelt for a time at Mingo Bottom in  Jefferson County, the rendezvous of the assassins who marched against  Gnadenhiitten under Williamson, and of the assassins who were beaten  back from Sandusky under Crawford. Here, as before, Logan was the friend  of the white man, and it was not till the murder of his father, brother,  and sister, cried to him for vengeance, that he made war upon them.    His kindred were of a small party of Indians whom some Virginians lured  across the Ohio near the mouth of Yellow Creek in 1774. On the Virginia  side the murderers made three of the Indians drunk and tomahawked them,  and when they had tricked the others into discharging their guns at  a mark, and so had them defenseless, they ruthlessly shot them down.  Logan's sister, who was the only woman in the party, tried to escape,  but a bullet cut short her flight, and she died praying her murderers to  have mercy on the babe she held in her arms. They spared it, and he  who tells the cruel tale saw it the next day in his own mother's arms  smiling up into her face, while she fed and fondled it.    The news came to Logan while he was speaking at a council of the  Indians, and urging them to make peace with the whites. He instantly  changed his plea; he lifted up his hatchet, and yowed never to lay it  down till he had avenged himself tenfold. He kept his word, and that  summer thirty scalps and prisoners bore witness to his fury.    But it was a short-lived impulse of a nature essentially so good that it  could not long keep the memory of even such an injury. In this very war,  or this out-Durst of the long Indian war, Logan showed himself as before  the friend of the white men. He had pity on many of the captives he  made, and when he could he tried to move other captors to pity. Major  William Robinson, who was one of Logan's prisoners, tells how he was  surprised, together with two friends, by a party of Indians who fired on  them. Robinson ran with a savage in hot chase behind him, who called  to him in English, \"Stop; I won't hurt you.\" \"Yes, you will,\" Robinson  retorted. \"No, I won't,\" the Indian insisted; \"but if you don't stop,  I'll shoot you.\" Robinson fell over a log, and the Indian seized him.  It was Logan, who told him not to be frightened for he should be adopted  into his own tribe when they reached his village. There he was made to  run the gantlet, but Logan instructed him how to manage so that he  got through without harm. Robinson was then tied to the stake and the  Indians prepared to burn him. It was the summer after the murder of  Logan's kindred, and they had already whipped one Virginian to death  merely because his brother was present at the massacre. They could not  forgive, but Logan rose before the council and pleaded with all his  eloquence for Robinson's life. Three times the captive was untied  from the stake, and three times tied to it again before Logan's words  prevailed. At last the great chief was allowed to lay the belt of wampum  on the prisoner for a sign that he was adopted. Then he gave him in  charge to a young Indian, saying, \"This is your cousin; you are to go  home with him, and he will take care of you.\"    But still the sense of his wrong, and the hunger for revenge, gnawed at  Logan's heart, and one day he came to Robinson with a piece of paper  and bade him write a letter for him. He said he meant to leave it in  the cabin of a white man which he was going, to attack, and it was  afterwards found there tied to a war club. He made Robinson write  it several times before he thought the words strong enough. It was  addressed to the man whom Logan thought guilty of the death of his  kindred, but who was afterwards known to have been not even present at  their murder.         \"Captain Cresap: What did you kill my people on       Yellow Creek for? The white people killed my kin at       Conestoga, a great while ago, and I thought nothing       of that. But you killed my kin again on Yellow Creek,       and took my cousin prisoner. Then I thought I must       kill, too. I have been three times to war since then;       but the Indians are not angry; only myself.         \"July 21, 1774.         \"Captain John Logan.\"    Both the matter and the language of this letter are so like those of  Logan's famous speech, that it is clear he must often have thought his  wrongs over in the same terms, brooding upon them with an aching  heart, but not with hate so much as grief. The speech was made at the  Chillicothe town where Lord Dunmore treated with the Ohio tribes for  peace in the August after Logan had written his letter, but it was not  spoken in the council. Logan held aloof from the council, and Dunmore  sent to his cabin for him. It is said by some that his messenger was  the great renegade Simon Girty, who had not yet turned against his own  people, and was then, with his friend Simon Kenton, a scout in Dunmore's  service. Others say that the messenger was a young man named Gibson, but  whoever he was, Logan met him at the door, and coming out into the woods  sat down under a tree which was long known as Logan's Elm. Here, with a  burst of tears, he told the story of his wrongs in language which cannot  be forgotten as long as men have hearts to thrill for others' sorrows.    [Illustration: Logan's Elm 149]    \"I appeal to any white man to say if ever he entered Logan's cabin and  I gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked and I gave him  not clothing. During the course of the last long and bloody war Logan  remained in his tent an advocate of peace. Nay, such was my love for the  whites that those of my own country pointed at me as they passed, and  said, 'Logan is the friend of the white man.' I had even thought to  live with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the  last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked, cut off all the relatives of  Logan, not sparing even my women and children. There runs not a drop  of my blood in the veins of any human creature. This called on me for  revenge. I have sought it. I have killed many. I have fully glutted my  vengeance. For my country I rejoice at the beams of peace. Yet do not  harbor the thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear.  He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for  Logan? Not one.\"    This speech, or rather this message, which Logan sent to Lord Dunmore,  has come down to us in two forms, one which Dunmore's officers wrote out  from the report of the message, and one which Thomas Jefferson framed  upon it. They do not differ greatly, and I have given Jefferson's  version here, because it best expresses the noble mind of a noble man,  a savage, indeed, but far less savage than many of the white men of that  day or any day. A pioneer of Western Pennsylvania, William Brown, who  afterwards became a judge of the Mifflin County courts, calls him \"the  best specimen of humanity he ever met with, _white_ or _red_,\" He first  saw him in the woods, while stooping to drink at a spring. The figure of  a tall Indian showed itself to him in the water, and he sprang for  his rifle, but the Indian knocked the priming out of his own gun, and  offered his hand. It was Logan, and he guided Brown to the hunting camp  of another white man, with whom he afterwards visited Logan's camp.  There they all shot at a mark for a dollar each round, and Logan lost.  A deerskin was worth a dollar, and Logan offered five skins for his five  failures. Brown's friend refused them, saying they were his guests  and had shot with him merely for a trial of skill. Logan answered with  dignity, \"Me try to make you shoot your best; me gentlemen, and me take  your dollar if me beat,\" and he would not allow the victor even to give  him a horn of powder in return.    A lovely story was told by the daughter of Judge Brown concerning Logan,  who was one day at her father's camp when her mother happened to regret  that she had no shoes for her little one then just beginning to walk.  Logan said nothing, but shortly after he came and asked the mother to  let the child spend the day with him at his camp. The mother trembled,  but she knew the delicacy of Logan, and she would not wound him by  showing fear of him. He took the child away, and the long hours passed  till nightfall. Then she saw the great chief coming with his tiny  guest through the woods, and the next moment the child bounded into the  mother's arms, proud and glad to show her feet in the moccasins which  Logan had made for her.    In his old age Logan wandered from place to place, broken by the  misfortunes of his people, and homeless in his own land. He fell a prey  to drink, the enemy of all his race, and he was at last murdered near  Detroit, where, as the story goes, he was sitting by his camp fire, with  his blanket over his head, and lost in gloomy thought, when an Indian  whom he had offended stole upon him and sank his tomahawk in Logan's  skull.    Of all the Indians he seems to me the grandest because he was the  kindest. Tecaughretanego was wise and good. He had a thoughtful mind and  a serene spirit; he could be just and loving to the white man whom he  had taken for his brother, but he had not so noble an ideal of conduct  as Logan. This chief grasped the notion of friendship with all the  whites; he was more than a tribesman; he imagined what it was to be  a citizen. Among the Ohio men of the past there is no nature more  beautiful, no memory worthier than his. He was a savage, and his thirst  for vengeance, or rather the smoldering thought of his wrongs, lowered  him for a time to the level of the white and red men about him. Yet he  was framed for gentleness, and he surpassed another great Ohio Indian  as much in breadth of character, as he surpassed Tecaughretanego in an  ideal of conduct.    Tecumseh, the famous war chief of the Shawnees, was born at the  ancient town of"]]]
