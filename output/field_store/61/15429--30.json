The party rides all night and all the next day without  stopping, and the robbers often look round to see if they are pursued.  They rest for the first time at the salt spring, posting a look-out on  an adjacent mound. They eat and drink without losing a minute, and get  ready for the rest of the ride. The captives are paralysed with fright;  the young women are half choked with weeping, and a little lad in a  tattered shirt goes about crying vainly for his mother. The eyes of the  captives are blindfolded with white bandages that they may not notice  the way they are travelling and try later to escape back to Bam. Then  the headlong ride is resumed, and after eight days the troop of riders  is back at home with their booty, but without their chief.    Innumerable raids of this kind have scourged eastern Persia, and in the  same way Turkomans have devastated Khorasan in the north-east. On the  eastern frontier it is the Kurds who are the robbers. In this disturbed  frontier region there is not a town without its small primitive mud fort  or outlook tower.      SCORPIONS    On running dromedaries we now ride on eastwards through northern  Baluchistan. Dry, burnt-up desert tracts, scantily clothed with  thistles and shrubs, moving dunes of fine yellow sand, low hill ridges  disintegrated by alternate heat and cold--such is the country where a  few nomads wander about with their flocks, and the stranger often  wonders how the animals find a living. In certain valleys, however,  there is pasture and also water, and sometimes belts of thriving  tamarisks are passed, and bushes of saxaul with green leafy branches,  hard wood, and roots which penetrate down to the moisture beneath the  surface.    The great caravan road we are following is, however, exceedingly  desolate. Only at the stations is water to be found, and even that is  brackish; but the worst trial is the heat, which now, at the end of  April, becomes more oppressive every day. The temperature rises nearly  up to 105-1/2 deg. in the shade, and to ride full in the face of the  sun is like thrusting one's head into a blazing furnace. When there is  a wind we are all right, and the sand whirls like yellow ghosts over  the heated ground. But when the air is calm the outlines of the hills  seem to quiver in the heat, and the barrel of a gun which has been out  in the sun blisters the hands on being touched. In the height of the  summer the Baluchis wrap strips of felt round their stirrup-irons to  protect the dromedaries from burns on the flanks.    This region is one of the hottest in the world. The sun stands so high  at mid-day that the shadows of the dromedaries disappear beneath them.  You long for sunset, when the shadows lengthen out and the worst of the  heat is over. It is not really cool even at night, when, moreover, you  are plagued with whole swarms of gnats.    Baluchistan and Persia abound with scorpions, which are indeed to be  found in all the hot regions of the five continents. About two hundred  species have been distinguished. Some are quite small, others six inches  long. Some are dark-brown, others reddish, and others again  straw-yellow, as in Baluchistan. The body consists of a head and thorax  without joints, and a hinder part of seven articulated rings, besides  six tail rings. The last ring, the thirteenth, contains two poison  glands and is furnished with a sting as fine as a needle. The poison is  a fluid clear as water.    Scorpions live in rotten tree-trunks, under stones, on walls, and as  they like warmth they often enter houses and huts, and creep into  clothes and beds.    The scorpion leaves his dark den at night and sets out on the hunt. He  holds his tail turned up over his back, in order to keep his sting from  injury and to be ready at once for attack or defence. When he meets with  a desirable victim, such as a large spider, he darts quickly forward,  seizes it with his claws, which are like those of crabs, raises it above  his head in order to examine it with his eyes, which are turned upwards,  and gives it the death-stroke with his sting. Then he sucks up the  softer parts and grinds the harder between his jaws.    The young ones, which are active as soon as they are born, are like the  old ones from the first day, but are light-coloured and soft. They crawl  about their mother's back and legs and do not leave her body for some  time. When that happens the mother dies, having meanwhile wasted away.    The sting of large scorpions is dangerous even to human beings. Cases  have been known of a man dying in great agony twelve hours after being  stung. Others get cramp, fever, and pains before they begin to recover.  A man who has often been stung becomes at last insensible to the poison.    Many a time I have found scorpions in Asiatic huts, in my tent, on my  bed, and under my boxes, but I have never been stung by one. On the  other hand, it has been the fate of many of my servants, and they told  me that it was difficult to find out where the scorpion had stung them,  for their bodies sweated and burned equally intensely all over. In  Eastern Turkestan it is the practice to catch the scorpion which has  stung a man and crush him into a paste, which is laid over the puncture  made by the sting. But whether this is a real cure I do not know.      THE INDUS    After travelling 1500 miles on camels and dromedaries, the whistle of an  engine sounds like the sweetest music to the ear. At Nushki (see map, p.  132), the furthermost station of the Indian railway, I took leave of my  Baluchi servants, stepped into a train, and was carried past the  garrison town of Quetta south-eastwards to the Indus. Here we find that  one branch of the railway follows the river closely on its western bank  to Karachi, one of the principal seaports of British India. Our train,  however, carries us northwards along the eastern bank to Rawalpindi, an  important military station near the borders of Kashmir.    [Illustration: MAP OF NORTHERN INDIA, SHOWING RIVERS AND MOUNTAIN RANGES.]    In the large roomy compartment it is as warm as it was lately in  Baluchistan, or nearly 107 deg. To shade the railway carriages from the  burning sun overhead, they are provided with a kind of wooden cover with  flaps falling down half over the windows. The glass is not white, as in  European carriage windows, but dark blue or green, otherwise the  reflexion of the sunlight from the ground would be too dazzling. On  either side two windows have, instead of glass, a lattice of root  fibres which are kept wet automatically night and day. Outside the  window is a ventilator, which, set in action by the motion of the train,  forces a rapid current of air through the wet network of fibres. Thereby  the air is cooled some eighteen or twenty degrees, and it is pleasant to  sit partly undressed in the draught.    Look a moment at the map. South of the Himalayas the Indian peninsula  forms an inverted triangle, the apex of which juts out into the Indian  Ocean like a tooth, but the northern part, at the base, is broad. Here  flow the three large rivers of India, the Indus, the Ganges, and the  Bramaputra. The last mentioned waters the plains of Assam at the eastern  angle of the triangle. On the banks of the Ganges stands a swarm of  famous large towns, some of which we shall visit when we return from  Tibet. The Ganges and Bramaputra have a delta in common, through which  their waters pass by innumerable arms out into the Bay of Bengal.    At the western angle of the triangle the Indus streams down to the  Arabian Sea. The sources of the Indus and Bramaputra lie close to each  other, up in Tibet, and the Himalayas are set like an immense jewel  between the glistening silver threads of the two rivers. On the west the  Indus cuts through a valley as much as 10,000 feet deep, and on the east  the Bramaputra makes its way down to the lowlands through a deep-cut  cleft not less wild and awesome.    The Indus has several tributaries. In foaming waterfalls and roaring  rapids they rush down from the mountains to meet their lord. The largest  of them is called the Sutlej, and the lowlands through which it flows  are called the Punjab, a Persian word signifying \"five waters.\" The  Indus has thirteen mouths scattered along 150 miles of coast, and the  whole river is 2000 miles long, or somewhat longer than the Danube.    In the month of July, 325 years before the birth of Christ, Aristotle's  pupil, Alexander, King of Macedonia, floated down the Indus with a fleet  of newly built ships and reached Pattala, where the arms of the delta  diverge. He found the town deserted, for the inhabitants had fled  inland, so he sent light troops after them to tell them that they might  return in peace to their homes. A fortress was erected at the town, and  several wharves on the river bank.    He turned over great schemes in his mind. Had he not at twenty years of  age taken over the government of the little country of Macedonia, and  subdued the people of Thrace, Illyria, and Greece? Had he not led his  troops over the Hellespont, defeated the Persians, and conquered the  countries of Asia Minor, Lycia, Cappadocia, and Phrygia, where with a  blow of his sword he had severed the Gordian knot, a token of supremacy  over Asia? At Issus, on the rectangular bay facing Cyprus, he had  inflicted a crushing defeat on the great King of Persia, Darius  Codomannus, who with the united forces of his kingdom had come to meet  him. At Damascus he captured all the Persian war funds, and afterwards  took the famous commercial towns of the Phoenicians, Tyre and Sidon.  Palestine fell, and Jerusalem with the holy places. On the coast of  Egypt he founded Alexandria, which now, after a lapse of 2240 years, is  still a flourishing city. He marched through the Libyan desert to the  oasis of Zeus Ammon,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2071"],[0,"Stories (#20)"],[1,"avoid them, or glare at them savagely, or say hard things of  them? Oh no! quite the reverse. He was a little shy at first; and when  he saw a party of distressed damsels in a station, with their bewildered  father in vain attempting to make himself understood to a porter, he  would assist them in a brief and businesslike manner as if it were a  duty, lift his cap, and then march off relieved. But by-and-by he  began to make acquaintances in the hotel; and as he was a handsome,  English-looking lad, who bore a certificate of honesty in his clear gray  eyes and easy gait, he was rather made much of. Nor could any fault be  decently found with his appetite.    So we passed on from Konigswinter to Coblenz, and from Coblenz to  Heidelberg, and from Heidelberg south to Freiburg, where we bade adieu  to the last of the towns, and laid hold of a trap with a pair of ancient  and angular horses, and plunged into the Hollenthal, the first great  gorge of the Black Forest mountains. From one point to another we slowly  urged our devious course, walking the most of the day, indeed, and  putting the trap and ourselves up for the night at some quaint roadside  hostelry, where we ate of roe-deer and drank of Affenthaler, and  endeavoured to speak German with a pure Waldshut accent. And then, one  evening, when the last rays of the sun were shining along the hills and  touching the stems of the tall pines, we drove into a narrow valley and  caught sight of a large brown building of wood, with projecting eaves  and quaint windows, that stood close by the forest.    \"Here is my dear inn!\" cried Tita, with a great glow of delight and  affection in her face. \"Here is _mein gutes Thal! Ich gruss' dich ein  tausend Mal!_ And here is old Peter come out to see us; and there is  Franziska!\"    \"Oh, this is Franziska, is it?\" said Charlie.    Yes, this was Franziska. She was a well-built, handsome girl of nineteen  or twenty, with a healthy, sunburnt complexion, and dark hair plaited  into two long tails, which were taken up and twisted into a knot behind.  That you could see from a distance. But on nearer approach you found  that Franziska had really fine and intelligent features, and a pair of  frank, clear, big brown eyes that had a very straight look about them.  They were something of the eyes of a deer, indeed; wide apart, soft, and  apprehensive, yet looking with a certain directness and unconsciousness  that overcame her natural girlish timidity. Tita simply flew at her and  kissed her heartily and asked her twenty questions at once. Franziska  answered in very fair English, a little slow and formal, but quite  grammatical. Then she was introduced to Charlie, and she shook hands  with him in a simple and unembarrassed way; and then she turned to one  of the servants and gave some directions about the luggage. Finally she  begged Tita to go indoors and get off her travelling attire, which was  done, leaving us two outside.    \"She's a very pretty girl,\" Charlie said, carelessly. \"I suppose she's  sort of head cook and kitchen-maid here.\"    The impudence of these young men is something extraordinary.    \"If you wish to have your head in your hands,\" I remarked to him, \"just  you repeat that remark at dinner. Why, Franziska is no end of a swell.  She has two thousand pounds and the half of a mill. She has a sister  married to the Geheimer-Ober-Hofbaurath of Hesse-Cassel. She had visited  both Paris and Munich, and she has her dresses made in Freiburg.\"    \"But why does such an illustrious creature bury herself in this valley,  and in an old inn, and go about bareheaded?\"    \"Because there are folks in the world without ambition, who like to  live a quiet, decent, homely life. Every girl can't marry a  Geheimer-Ober-Hofbaurath. Ziska, now, is much more likely to marry the  young doctor here.\"    \"Oh, indeed! and live here all her days. She couldn't do better. Happy  Franziska!\"    We went indoors. It was a low, large, rambling place, with one immense  room all hung round with roe-deers' horns, and with one lesser room  fitted up with a billiard-table. The inn lay a couple of hundred yards  back from Huferschingen; but it had been made the headquarters of the  keepers, and just outside this room there were a number of pegs for them  to sling their guns and bags on when they came in of an evening to have  a pipe and a chopin of white wine. Ziska's uncle and aunt were both  large, stout, and somnolent people, very good-natured and kind, but a  trifle dull. Ziska really had the management of the place, and she was  not slow to lend a hand if the servants were remiss in waiting on us.  But that, it was understood, was done out of compliment to our small  Queen Tita.    By-and-by we sat down to dinner, and Franziska came to see that  everything was going on straight. It was a dinner \"with scenery.\" You  forgot to be particular about the soup, the venison, and the Affenthaler  when from the window at your elbow you could look across the narrow  valley and behold a long stretch of the Black Forest shining in the red  glow of the sunset. The lower the sun sank the more intense became the  crimson light on the tall stems of the pines; and then you could see the  line of shadow slowly rising up the side of the opposite hill until only  the topmost trees were touched with fire. Then these too lost it, and  all the forest around us seemed to have a pale-blue mist stealing over  it as the night fell and the twilight faded out of the sky overhead.  Presently the long undulations of fir grew black, the stars came out,  and the sound of the stream could be heard distantly in the hollow; and  then, at Tita's wish, we went off for a last stroll in among the soft  moss and under the darkness of the pines, now and again starting some  great capercailzie, and sending it flying and whirring down the glades.    When we returned from that prowl into the forest, we found the inn dark.  Such people as may have called in had gone home; but we suspected that  Franziska had given the neighbours a hint not to overwhelm us on our  first arrival. When we entered the big room, Franziska came in with  candles; then she brought some matches, and also put on the table an odd  little pack of cards, and went out. Her uncle and aunt had, even before  we went out, come and bade us good-night formally, and shaken hands all  round. They are early folk in the Black Forest.    \"Where has that girl gone now?\" says Charlie. \"Into that lonely  billiard-room! Couldn't you ask her to come in here? Or shall we go and  play billiards?\"    Tita stares, and then demurely smiles; but it is with an assumed  severity that she rebukes him for such a wicked proposal, and reminds  him that he must start early next morning. He groans assent. Then she  takes her leave.    The big young man was silent for a moment or two, with his hands in his  pockets and his legs stretched out. I begin to think I am in for it--the  old story of blighted hopes and angry denunciation and hypocritical  joy, and all the rest of it. But suddenly Charlie looks up with a  businesslike air and says:    \"Who is that doctor fellow you were speaking about! Shall we see him  to-morrow?\"    \"You saw him to-night. It was he who passed us on the road with the two  beagles.\"    \"What! that little fellow with the bandy legs and the spectacles?\" he  cries, with a great laugh.    \"That little fellow,\" I observe to him, \"is a person of some importance,  I can tell you. He--\"    \"I suppose his sister married a Geheimer-Ober-under--what the dickens is  it?\" says this disrespectful young man.    \"Dr. Krumm has got the Iron Cross.\"    \"That won't make his legs any the straighter.\"    \"He was at Weissenburg.\"    \"I suppose he got that cast in the eye there.\"    \"He can play the zither in a way that would astonish you. He has got a  little money. Franziska and he would be able to live very comfortably  together.\"    \"Franziska and that fellow?\" says Charlie; and then he rises with a  sulky air, and proposes we should take our candles with us.    But he is not sulky very long; for Ziska, hearing our footsteps, comes  to the passage and bids us a friendly good-night.    \"Good-night, Miss Fahler!\" he says, in rather a shamefaced way; \"and  I am so awfully sorry we have kept you up so late. We sha'n't do it  again.\"    You would have thought by his manner that it was two o'clock, whereas it  was only half-past eleven!          III--DR. KRUMM    There was no particular reason why Dr. Krumm should marry Franziska  Fahler, except that he was the most important young man in  Huferschingen, and she was the most important young woman. People  therefore thought they would make a good match, although Franziska  certainly had the most to give in the way of good looks. Dr. Krumm was  a short, bandy-legged, sturdy young man, with long, fair hair, a tanned  complexion, light-blue eyes not quite looking the same way, spectacles,  and a general air of industrious common sense about him, if one may use  such a phrase. There was certainly little of the lover in his manner  toward Ziska, and as little in hers toward him. They were very good  friends, though, and he called her Ziska, while she gave him his  nickname of Fidelio, his real name being Fidele.    Now on this, the first morning of our stay in Huferschingen, all the  population had turned out at an early hour to see us start for the  forest; and as the Ober-Forster had gone away to visit his parents in  Bavaria, Dr. Krumm was appointed to superintend the operations of  the day. And when everybody was busy renewing acquaintance with us,  gathering the straying dogs, examining guns and cartridge-belts, and  generally aiding in the profound commotion of our setting out, Dr. Krumm  was found to be talking in a very friendly and familiar manner with  our pretty Franziska. Charlie eyed them askance. He began to say  disrespectful things of Krumm: he thought Krumm a plain person. And  then,"]]]
