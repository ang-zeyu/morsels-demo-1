Whilst at Paris he was especially assiduous in collecting, and he relates  with intense rapture, how many choice libraries he found there full of  all kinds of books, which tempted him to spend his money freely; and with  a gladsome heart he gave his dirty lucre for treasures so inestimable to  the bibliomaniac.    Before the commencement of the war which arose from the disputed claims  of Edward, Richard de Bury returned to enjoy in sweet seclusion his  bibliomanical propensities. The modern bibliophiles who know what it is  to revel in the enjoyment of a goodly library, luxuriant in costly  bindings and rich in bibliographical rarities, who are fully susceptible  to the delights and exquisite sensibilities of that sweet madness called  bibliomania, will readily comprehend the multiplied pleasures of that  early and illustrious bibliophile in the seclusion of Auckland Palace; he  there ardently applied his energies and wealth to the accumulation of  books; and whilst engaged in this pleasing avocation, let us endeavor to  catch a glimpse of him. Chambre, to whom we are indebted for many of the  above particulars, tells us that Richard de Bury was learned in the  governing of his house, hospitable to strangers, of great charity, and  fond of disputation with the learned, but he principally delighted in a  multitude of books, _Iste summe delectabatur multitudine librorum_,[182]  and possessed more books than all the bishops put together, an assertion  which requires some modification, and must not be too strictly regarded,  for book collecting at that time was becoming a favorite pursuit; still  the language of Chambre is expressive, and clearly proves how extensive  must have been his libraries, one of which he formed in each of his  various palaces, _diversis maneriis_. So engrossed was that worthy bishop  with the passion of book collecting, that his dormitory was strewed  _jucebant_ with them, in every nook and corner choice volumes were  scattered, so that it was almost impossible for any person to enter  without placing his feet upon some book.[183] He kept in regular  employment no small assemblage of antiquaries, scribes, bookbinders,  correctors, illuminators, and all such persons who were capable of being  useful in the service of books, _librorum servitiis utiliter_.[184]    During his retirement he wrote a book, from the perusal of which the  bibliomaniac will obtain a full measure of delight and instruction. It is  a faithful record of the life and experience of this bibliophile of the  olden time. He tells us how he collected his vellum treasures--his  \"crackling tomes\" so rich in illuminations and calligraphic art!--how he  preserved them, and how he would have others read them. Costly indeed  must have been the book gems he amassed together; for foreign countries,  as well as the scribes at home, yielded ample means to augment his  stores, and were incessantly employed in searching for rarities which his  heart yearned to possess. He completed his Philobiblon at his palace at  Auckland on the 24th of January, 1344.[185]    We learn from the prologue to this rare and charming little volume how  true and genuine a bibliomaniac was Richard de Bury, for he tells us  there, that a vehement love _amor excitet_ of books had so powerfully  seized all the faculties of his mind, that dismissing all other  avocations, he had applied the ardor of his thoughts to the acquisition  of books. Expense to him was quite an afterthought, and he begrudged no  amount to possess a volume of rarity or antiquity. Wisdom, he says, is an  infinite treasure _infinitus thesaurus_, the value of which, in his  opinion, was beyond all things; for how, he asks, can the sum be too  great which purchases such vast delight. We cannot admire the purity of  his Latin so much as the enthusiasm which pervades it; but in the eyes of  the bibliophile this will amply compensate for his minor imperfections.  When expatiating on the value of his books he appears to unbosom, as it  were, all the inward rapture of love. A very _helluo librorum_--a very  Maliabechi of a collector, yet he encouraged no selfish feeling to alloy  his pleasure or to mingle bitterness with the sweets of his avocation.  His knowledge he freely imparted to others, and his books he gladly lent.  This is apparent in the Philobiblon; and his generous spirit warms his  diction--not always chaste--into a fluent eloquence. His composition  overflows with figurative expressions, yet the rude, ungainly form on  which they are moulded deprive them of all claim to elegance or  chastity; but while the homeliness of his diction fails to impress us  with an idea of his versatility as a writer, his chatty anecdotal style  rivets and keeps the mind amused, so that we rise from the little book  with the consciousness of having obtained much profit and satisfaction  from its perusal. Nor is it only the bibliomaniac who may hope to taste  this pleasure in devouring the sweet contents of the Philobiblon; for  there are many hints, many wise sayings, and many singular ideas  scattered over its pages, which will amuse or instruct the general reader  and the lover of olden literature. We observe too that Richard de Bury,  as a writer, was far in advance of his age, and his work manifests an  unusual freedom and independence of mind in its author; for although  living in monkish days, when the ecclesiastics were almost supreme in  power and wealth, he was fully sensible of the vile corruptions and  abominations which were spreading about that time so fearfully among some  of the cloistered devotees--the spotless purity of the primitive times  was scarce known then--and the dark periods of the middle ages were  bright and holy, when compared with the looseness and carnality of those  turbulent days. Richard de Bury dipped his pen in gall when he spoke of  these sad things, and doubtless many a revelling monk winced under the  lashing words he applied to them; not only does he upbraid them for their  carelessness in religion, but severely reprimands their inattention to  literature and learning. \"The monks,\" he says, \"in the present day seem  to be occupied in emptying cups, not in correcting codices, _Calicibus  epotandis, non codicibus emendandis_, which they mingle with the  lascivious music of Timotheus, and emulate his immodest manners, so that  the sportive song _cantus ludentis_, and not the plaintive hymn, proceeds  from the cells of the monks. Flocks and fleeces, grain and granaries,  gardens and olives, potions and goblets, are in this day lessons and  studies of the monks, except some chosen few.\"[186] He speaks in equally  harsh terms of the religious mendicants. He accuses them of forgetting  the words and admonitions of their holy founder, who was a great lover of  books. He wishes them to imitate the ancient members of that fraternity,  who were poor in spirit, but most rich in faith. But it must be  remembered, that about this time the mendicant friars were treated with  undeserved contempt, and much ill feeling rose against them among the  clergy, but the clergy were somewhat prejudiced in their judgment. The  order of St. Dominic, which a century before gloried in the approbation  of the pope, and in the enjoyment of his potential bulls, now winced  under gloomy and foreboding frowns. The sovereign Pontiff Honorius III.  gratefully embraced the service of these friars, and confirmed their  order with important privileges. His successor, Gregory IX., ratified  these favors to gain their useful aid in propping up the papal power, and  commanded the ecclesiastics by a bull to receive these \"well-beloved  children and preaching friars\" of his, with hospitality and respect.  Thus established, they were able to bear the tossings to and fro which  succeeding years produced; but in Richard de Bury's time darker clouds  were gathering--great men had severely chastized them with their pens and  denounced them in their preachings. Soon after a host of others sprang  up--among the most remarkable of whom were Johannes Poliaco, and  Fitzralph, Archbishop of Armagh, who was a dear friend and chaplain of  Richard de Bury's and many learned disputations were carried on between  them.[187] The celebrated oration of Fitzralph's, cited in the presence  of the pope, was a powerful blow to the mendicant friars--an examination  of the matter has rather perplexed than cleared the subject, and I find  it difficult which side to favor, the clergy seem to denounce the begging  friars more from envy and interested motives, for they looked with  extreme jealousy at the encroachments they had made upon their  ecclesiastical functions of confession, absolution, etc., so profitable  to the church in those days. In these matters the church had hitherto  reserved a sole monopoly, and the clergy now determined to protect it  with all the powers of oratorial denunciation; but, looking beyond this  veil of prejudice, I am prone to regard them favorably, for their intense  love of books, which they sought for and bought up with passionate  eagerness. Fitzralph, quite unintentionally, bestows a bright compliment  upon them, and as it bears upon our subject and illustrates the learning  of the time, I am tempted to give a few extracts; he sorely laments the  decrease of the number of students in the university of Oxford; \"So,\"  says he, \"that yet in my tyme, in the universitie of Oxenford, were  thirty thousand Scolers at ones; and now beth unnethe[188] sixe  thousand.\"[189] All the blame of this he lays to the friars, and accuses  them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],[0,"Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#20)"],[1,"se, Miss Peyton said that you were one of the wittiest young  men she knew of, and you were quite the life of the house.\"    \"I suppose I ought to blush,\" said Dick; \"but I'm a prey to hunger just  now, and it's too much of an effort.\"    \"I'll excuse you this time,\" said Fosdick. \"As to the hunger, that's  easily remedied. We shall get home to breakfast, and be in good time  too.\"    Fosdick was right. They were the first to seat themselves at the table.  Mr. Clifton came in directly afterwards. Dick felt a momentary  embarrassment.    \"What would he say,\" thought our hero, \"if he knew where I passed the  night?\"    \"Good-morning, Hunter,\" said Clifton. \"You didn't favor us with your  presence at dinner last evening.\"    \"No,\" said Dick. \"I was absent on very important business.\"    \"Dining with your friend, the mayor, probably?\"    \"Well, no, not exactly,\" said Dick, \"but I had some business with the  city government.\"    \"It seems to me that you're getting to be quite an important character.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Dick. \"I am glad to find that genius is sometimes  appreciated.\"    Here Miss Peyton entered.    \"Welcome, Mr. Hunter,\" she said. \"We missed you last evening.\"    \"I hope it didn't affect your appetite much,\" said Dick.    \"But it did. I appeal to Mr. Fosdick whether I ate anything to speak  of.\"    \"I thought Miss Peyton had a better appetite than usual,\" said Fosdick.    \"That is too bad of you, Mr. Fosdick,\" said Miss Peyton. \"I'm sure I  didn't eat more than my canary bird.\"    \"Just the way it affected me,\" said Dick. \"It always improves my  appetite to see you eat, Miss Peyton.\"    Miss Peyton looked as if she hardly knew whether to understand this  remark as complimentary or otherwise.    That evening, at the dinner-table, Clifton drew a copy of the \"Express\"  from his pocket, and said, \"By Jove, Hunter, here's a capital joke on  you! I'll read it. 'A boy, named Richard Hunter, was charged with  picking a pocket on Chatham Street; but it appearing that the theft was  committed by another party, he was released from custody.'\"    Dick's heart beat a little quicker while this was being read, but he  maintained his self-possession.    \"Of course,\" said he, \"that was the important business that detained me.  But I hope you won't mention it, for the sake of my family.\"    \"I'd make the young rascal change his name, if I were you,\" said  Clifton, \"if he's going to get into the Police record.\"    \"I think I shall,\" said Dick, \"or maybe I'll change my own. You couldn't  mention a highly respectable name that I could take,--could you?\"    \"Clifton is the most respectable name I know of,\" said the young  gentleman owning that name.    \"If you'll make me your heir, perhaps I'll adopt it.\"    \"I'll divide my debts with you, and give you the biggest half,\" said  Clifton.    It is unnecessary to pursue the conversation. Dick found to his  satisfaction that no one at the table suspected that he was the Richard  Hunter referred to in the \"Express.\"          CHAPTER XVIII.    THE CUP AND THE LIP.      While Dick's night preceding the trial was an anxious one, Gilbert and  Roswell Crawford passed a pleasant evening, and slept soundly.    \"Do you think Mr. Rockwell would be willing to give me the same wages he  has paid to the boot-black?\" he inquired with interest.    \"Perhaps he won't take you at all.\"    \"I think he ought to pay some attention to your recommendation,\" said  Mrs. Crawford. \"You ought to have some influence with him.\"    \"Of course,\" said Gilbert, \"I shall do what I can in the matter; but  it's a pity Roswell can't give better references.\"    \"He's never been with a decent employer yet. He's been very unlucky  about his places,\" said Mrs. Crawford.    She might have added that his employers had considered themselves  unfortunate in their engagement of her son; but, even if she had known  it, she would have considered that they were prejudiced against him, and  that they were in fault entirely.    \"I will do what I can for him,\" continued Gilbert; \"but I am very sure  he won't get as much as ten dollars a week.\"    \"I can earn as much as the boot-black, I should hope,\" said Roswell.    \"He didn't earn ten dollars a week.\"    \"He got it.\"    \"That's a very different thing.\"    \"Well, if I get it, I don't care if I don't earn it.\"    \"That's true enough,\" said Gilbert, who did not in his heart set a very  high estimate upon the services of his young cousin, and who, had the  business been his own, would certainly not have engaged him at any  price.    Roswell thought it best not to say any more, having on some previous  occasions been greeted with remarks from his cousin which could not by  any means be regarded as complimentary.    \"Do you think I had better come in at ten o'clock, Cousin James?\"  inquired Roswell, as breakfast was over, and Gilbert prepared to go to  the counting-room.    \"Well, perhaps you may come a little earlier, say about half-past nine,\"  said the book-keeper.    \"All right,\" said Roswell.    Being rather sanguine, he made up his mind that he was going to have the  place, and felt it difficult to keep his good fortune secret. Now, in  the next house there lived a boy named Edward McLean, who was in a  broker's office in Wall Street, at a salary of six dollars a week. Now,  though Edward had never boasted of his good fortune, it used to disturb  Roswell to think that his place and salary were so much superior to his  own. He felt that it was much more respectable to be in a broker's  office, independent of the salary, than to run around the city with  heavy bundles. But if he could enter such an establishment as Rockwell &  Cooper's, at a salary of ten dollars, he felt that he could look down  with conscious superiority upon Edward McLean, with his six dollars a  week.    He went over to his neighbor's, and found Edward just starting for Wall  Street.    \"How are you, Roswell?\" said Edward.    \"Pretty well. Are you going down to the office?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You've got a pretty good place,--haven't you?\"    \"Yes, I like it.\"    \"How much do you get?\"    \"Six dollars a week.\"    \"That's very fair,\" said Roswell, patronizingly.    \"How do you like your place?\" asked Edward. \"I believe you're in a  dry-goods store on Sixth Avenue.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said Roswell.    \"You were?\"    \"Yes, I went in temporarily to oblige them,\" said Roswell, loftily;  \"but, of course, I wouldn't engage to remain any length of time in such  a place, however large the inducements they might offer.\"    Considering Roswell's tone, it would hardly have been supposed that the  large inducements were four dollars a week, and that, even at that  compensation, his services were not desired.    \"Then it wasn't a good place?\" said Edward.    \"Well enough for such as liked it,\" said Roswell. \"I have no complaint  of Hall & Turner. I told them that it was not dissatisfaction with them  that led me to leave the place, but I preferred a different kind of  business.\"    \"Have you got another place?\"    \"I have an offer under consideration,\" said Roswell, consequentially;  \"one of the most solid firms in the city. They offer me ten dollars a  week.\"    \"Ten dollars a week!\" repeated Edward, somewhat staggered by the  statement. \"That's big pay.\"    \"Yes,\" said Roswell; \"but I think I ought to get as much as that.\"    \"Why, I thought myself lucky to get six dollars,\" said Edward.    \"Yes, that's very fair,\" said Roswell, condescendingly. \"In fact, I've  worked at that figure myself; but, of course, one expects more as he  grows older.\"    \"I suppose you'll accept your offer,\" said Edward.    \"I haven't quite made up my mind,\" said Roswell, carelessly. \"I think I  shall.\"    \"You'd better. Such places don't grow on every bush.\"    Though Edward did not more than half believe Roswell's statement, he  kept his disbelief to himself, feeling that it was a matter of  indifference to him whether Roswell received a large or small salary.    \"I must be going down to the office,\" he said. \"Good-morning.\"    \"Good-morning,\" said Roswell, and he re-entered the house, feeling that  he had impressed Edward with a conviction of his superiority, and the  value set upon his services by the business men of New York. He went  upstairs, and picked out a flashy necktie from his drawer, tied it  carefully before the glass, and about nine set out for Rockwell &  Cooper's warehouse.    It is necessary for us to precede him.    Gilbert reached the counting-room at the usual time. His thoughts on the  way thither were pleasant.    \"I shan't be subjected to that young rascal's impertinence,\" he  considered. \"That's one satisfaction.\"    His astonishment, nay, dismay, may be imagined, therefore, when, on  entering the counting-room, the first object his eyes rested on was the  figure of Dick.    \"Good-morning, Mr. Gilbert,\" said our hero, pleasantly.    \"How came you here?\" he demanded.    \"I walked,\" said Dick. \"I don't often ride. I think walkin's good for  the constitution.\"    \"You know what I mean, well enough. How did you get out of prison?\"    \"I haven't been there.\"    \"You were arrested for picking a man's pocket yesterday afternoon,\" said  Gilbert.    \"Excuse me, Mr. Gilbert, you're slightly mistaken there. I was arrested  _on suspicion_ of picking a man's pocket.\"    \"The same thing.\"    \"Not quite, as it has been proved that I was innocent, and the wallet  was taken by another boy.\"    \"Have you been tried?\"    \"Yes, and acquitted.\"    Gilbert looked and felt disappointed. He could not conceive how Dick  could have escaped when the plot to entrap him had been so artfully  contrived.    \"Well, young man,\" he said, \"I'll give you a piece of advice, and if  you're wise you'll follow it.\"    \"That's kind in you,\" said Dick.    \"I pass over your impertinence this time, and will advise you as a  friend to resign your situation before Mr. Rockwell comes.\"    \"Why should I?\"    \"It'll save your being discharged.\"    \"Do you think he'll"]]]
