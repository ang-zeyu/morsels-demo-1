But all this time the old juggler, magician, fairy or whatever you  choose to call him, was looking anxiously into the sky. The result of  this trick was more than he had bargained for. True, he had been able to  produce the magic peach which the mandarin had called for, but his son,  where was his son? He shaded his eyes and looked far up into the blue  heavens, and so did the people, but no one could catch a glimpse of the  departed youth.    \"Oh, my son, my son,\" cried the old man in despair, \"how cruel is the  fate that has robbed me of you, the only prop of my declining years! Oh,  my boy, my boy, would that I had not sent you on so perilous a journey!  Who now will look after my grave when I am gone?\"    Suddenly the silken cord on which the young man had sped so daringly  into the sky, gave a quick jerk which almost toppled over the post to  which it was tied, and there, before the very eyes of the people, it  fell from the lofty height, a silken pile on the ground in front of  them.    The greybeard uttered a loud cry and covered his face with his hands.  \"Alas! the whole story is plain enough,\" he sobbed. \"My boy was caught  in the act of plucking the magic peach from the garden of the gods, and  they have thrown him into prison. Woe is me! Ah! woe is me!\"    The mandarin and his friends were deeply touched by the old man's grief,  and tried in vain to comfort him. \"Perhaps he will return,\" they said.  \"Have courage!\"    \"Yes, but in what a shape?\" replied the magician. \"See! even now they  are restoring him to his father.\"    The people looked, and they saw twirling and twisting through the air  the young man's arm. It fell upon the ground in front of them at the  fairy's feet. Next came the head, a leg, the body. One by one before the  gasping, shuddering people, the parts of the unfortunate young man were  restored to his father.    After the first outburst of wild, frantic grief the old man by a great  effort gained control of his feelings, and began to gather up these  parts, putting them tenderly into the wooden box.    By this time many of the spectators were weeping at the sight of the  father's affliction. \"Come,\" said the mandarin at last, deeply moved,  \"let us present the old man with sufficient money to give his boy a  decent burial.\"    All present agreed willingly, for there is no sight in China that causes  greater pity than that of an aged parent robbed by death of an only son.  The copper cash fell in a shower at the juggler's feet, and soon tears  of gratitude were mingled with those of sorrow. He gathered up the money  and tied it in a large black cloth. Then a wonderful change came over  his face. He seemed all of a sudden to forget his grief. Turning to the  box, he raised the lid. The people heard him say: \"Come, my son; the  crowd is waiting for you to thank them. Hurry up! They have been very  kind to us.\"    In an instant the box was thrown open with a bang, and before the  mandarin and his friends, before the eyes of all the sightseers the  young man, strong and whole once more, stepped forth and bowed, clasping  his hands and giving the national salute.    For a moment all were silent. Then, as the wonder of the whole thing  dawned upon them, the people broke forth into a tumult of shouts,  laughter, and compliments. \"The fairies have surely come to visit us!\"  they shouted. \"The city will be blessed with good fortune! Perhaps it is  Fairy Old Boy himself who is among us!\"    The mandarin rose and addressed the jugglers, thanking them in the name  of the city for their visit and for the taste they had given to him and  his guests of the peach from the heavenly orchard.    Even as he spoke, the magic box opened again; the two fairies  disappeared inside, the lid closed, and the chest rose from the ground  above the heads of the people. For a moment it floated round in a circle  like some homing pigeon trying to find its bearings before starting on  a return journey. Then, with a sudden burst of speed, it shot off into  the heavens and vanished from the sight of those below, and not a thing  remained as proof of the strange visitors except the magic peach seed  that lay beside the teacups on the mandarin's table.    According to the most ancient writings there is now nothing left to tell  of this story. It has been declared, however, by later scholars that the  official and his friends who had eaten the magic peach, at once began to  feel a change in their lives. While, before the coming of the fairies,  they had lived unfairly, accepting bribes and taking part in many  shameful practices, now, after tasting of the heavenly fruit, they began  to grow better. The people soon began to honour and love them, saying,  \"Surely these great men are not like others of their kind, for these men  are just and honest in their dealings with us. They seem not to be  ruling for their own reward!\"    However this may be, we do know that before many years their city became  the centre of the greatest peach-growing section of China, and even  yet when strangers walk in the orchards and look up admiringly at the  beautiful sweet-smelling fruit, the natives sometimes ask proudly, \"And  have you never heard about the wonderful peach which was the beginning  of all our orchards, the magic peach the fairies brought us from the  Western Heaven?\"          THE PHANTOM VESSEL    [Illustration]      Once a ship loaded with pleasure-seekers was sailing from North China  to Shanghai. High winds and stormy weather had delayed her, and she was  still one week from port when a great plague broke out on board. This  plague was of the worst kind. It attacked passengers and sailors alike  until there were so few left to sail the vessel that it seemed as if she  would soon be left to the mercy of winds and waves.    On all sides lay the dead, and the groans of the dying were most  terrible to hear. Of that great company of travellers only one, a  little boy named Ying-lo, had escaped. At last the few sailors, who  had been trying hard to save their ship, were obliged to lie down upon  the deck, a prey to the dreadful sickness, and soon they too were  dead.    Ying-lo now found himself alone on the sea. For some reason--he did not  know why--the gods or the sea fairies had spared him, but as he looked  about in terror at the friends and loved ones who had died, he almost  wished that he might join them.    The sails flapped about like great broken wings, while the giant waves  dashed higher above the deck, washing many of the bodies overboard and  wetting the little boy to the skin. Shivering with cold, he gave himself  up for lost and prayed to the gods, whom his mother had often told him  about, to take him from this dreadful ship and let him escape the fatal  illness.    As he lay there praying he heard a slight noise in the rigging just  above his head. Looking up, he saw a ball of fire running along a  yardarm near the top of the mast. The sight was so strange that he  forgot his prayer and stared with open-mouthed wonder. To his  astonishment, the ball grew brighter and brighter, and then suddenly  began slipping down the mast, all the time increasing in size. The poor  boy did not know what to do or to think. Were the gods, in answer to his  prayer, sending fire to burn the vessel? If so, he would soon escape.  Anything would be better than to be alone upon the sea.    Nearer and nearer came the fireball. At last, when it reached the deck,  to Ying-lo's surprise, something very, very strange happened. Before he  had time to feel alarmed, the light vanished, and a funny little man  stood in front of him peering anxiously into the child's frightened  face.    \"Yes, you are the lad I'm looking for,\" he said at last, speaking in a  piping voice that almost made Ying-lo smile. \"You are Ying-lo, and you  are the only one left of this wretched company.\" This he said, pointing  towards the bodies lying here and there about the deck.    Although he saw that the old man meant him no harm, the child could say  nothing, but waited in silence, wondering what would happen next.    By this time the vessel was tossing and pitching so violently that it  seemed every minute as if it would upset and go down beneath the foaming  waves, never to rise again. Not many miles distant on the right, some  jagged rocks stuck out of the water, lifting their cruel heads as if  waiting for the helpless ship.    The newcomer walked slowly towards the mast and tapped on it three times  with an iron staff he had been using as a cane. Immediately the sails  spread, the vessel righted itself and began to glide over the sea so  fast that the gulls were soon left far behind, while the threatening  rocks upon which the ship had been so nearly dashed seemed like specks  in the distance.    \"Do you remember me?\" said the stranger, suddenly turning and coming up  to Ying-lo, but his voice was lost in the whistling of the wind, and the  boy knew only by the moving of his lips that the old man was talking.  The greybeard bent over until his mouth was at Ying-lo's ear: \"Did you  ever see me before?\"    With a puzzled look, at first the child shook his head. Then as he gazed  more closely there seemed to be something that he recognized about the  wrinkled face. \"Yes, I think so, but I don't know when.\"    With a tap of his staff the fairy stopped the blowing of the wind, and  then spoke once more to his small companion: \"One year ago I passed  through your village. I was dressed in rags, and was begging my way  along the street, trying to find some one who would feel sorry for me.  Alas! no one answered my cry for mercy. Not a crust was thrown into my  bowl. All the people were deaf, and fierce dogs drove me from door to  door. Finally when I was almost dying of hunger, I began to feel that  here was a village without one good person in it.

For one thing, the  key is on the outside of the door; for another, he is not quite such a  fool as that. But he is in a horrible position. He is known to be on bad  terms with his brother; he has just uttered some foolish threat to him,  which may possibly have been overheard. What is he to do? He does  the natural thing, the thing which Mark would always do in such  circumstances. He consults Cayley, the invaluable, inevitable Cayley.    \"Cayley is just outside, Cayley must have heard the shot, Cayley will  tell him what to do. He opens the door just as Cayley is coming to see  what is the matter. He explains rapidly. 'What's to be done, Cay?  What's to be done? It was an accident. I swear it was an accident. He  threatened me. He would have shot me if I hadn't. Think of something,  quick!'    \"Cayley has thought of something. 'Leave it to me,' he says. 'You clear  out altogether. I shot him, if you like. I'll do all the explaining. Get  away. Hide. Nobody saw you go in. Into the passage, quick. I'll come to  you there as soon as I can.'    \"Good Cayley. Faithful Cayley! Mark's courage comes back. Cayley  will explain all right. Cayley will tell the servants that it was an  accident. He will ring up the police. Nobody will suspect Cayley--Cayley  has no quarrel with Robert. And then Cayley will come into the passage  and tell him that it is all right, and Mark will go out by the other  end, and saunter slowly back to the house. He will be told the news by  one of the servants. Robert accidentally shot? Good Heavens!    \"So, greatly reassured, Mark goes into the library. And Cayley goes to  the door of the office.... and locks it. And then he bangs on the door  and shouts, 'Let me in!'\"    Antony was silent. Bill looked at him and shook his head.    \"Yes, Tony, but that doesn't make sense. What's the point of Cayley  behaving like that?\"    Antony shrugged his shoulders without answering.    \"And what has happened to Mark since?\"    Antony shrugged his shoulders again.    \"Well, the sooner we go into that passage, the better,\" said Bill.    \"You're ready to go?\"    \"Quite,\" said Bill, surprised.    \"You're quite ready for what we may find?\"    \"You're being dashed mysterious, old boy.\"    \"I know I am.\" He gave a little laugh, and went on, \"Perhaps I'm being  an ass, just a melodramatic ass. Well, I hope I am.\" He looked at his  watch.    \"It's safe, is it? They're still busy at the pond?\"    \"We'd better make certain. Could you be a sleuthhound, Bill--one of  those that travel on their stomachs very noiselessly? I mean, could you  get near enough to the pond to make sure that Cayley is still there,  without letting him see you?\"    \"Rather!\" He got up eagerly. \"You wait.\"    Antony's head shot up suddenly. \"Why, that was what Mark said,\" he  cried.    \"Mark?\"    \"Yes. What Elsie heard him say.\"    \"Oh, that.\"    \"Yes I suppose she couldn't have made a mistake, Bill? She did hear  him?\"    \"She couldn't have mistaken his voice, if that's what you mean.\"    \"Oh?\"    \"Mark had an extraordinary characteristic voice.\"    \"Oh!\"    \"Rather high-pitched, you know, and well, one can't explain, but--\"    \"Yes?\"    \"Well, rather like this, you know, or even more so if anything.\" He  rattled these words off in Mark's rather monotonous, high-pitched voice,  and then laughed, and added in his natural voice, \"I say, that was  really rather good.\"    Antony nodded quickly. \"That was like it?\" he said.    \"Exactly.\"    \"Yes.\" He got up and squeezed Bill's arm. \"Well just go and see about  Cayley, and then we'll get moving. I shall be in the library.\"    \"Right.\"    Bill nodded and walked off in the direction of the pond. This was  glorious fun; this was life. The immediate programme could hardly be  bettered. First of all he was going to stalk Cayley. There was a little  copse above the level of the pond, and about a hundred yards away from  it. He would come into this from the back, creep cautiously through  it, taking care that no twigs cracked, and then, drawing himself on his  stomach to the edge, peer down upon the scene below him. People were  always doing that sort of thing in books, and he had been filled with a  hopeless envy of them; well, now he was actually going to do it himself.  What fun!    And then, when he had got back unobserved to the house and reported to  Antony, they were going to explore the secret passage! Again, what fun!  Unfortunately there seemed to be no chance of buried treasure, but there  might be buried clues. Even if you found nothing, you couldn't get away  from the fact that a secret passage was a secret passage, and anything  might happen in it. But even that wasn't the end of this exciting day.  They were going to watch the pond that night; they were going to watch  Cayley under the moonlight, watch him as he threw into the silence of  the pond what? The revolver? Well, anyhow, they were going to watch him.  What fun!    To Antony, who was older and who realized into what deep waters they  were getting, it did not seem fun. But it was amazingly interesting.  He saw so much, and yet somehow it was all out of focus. It was like  looking at an opal, and discovering with every movement of it some new  colour, some new gleam of light reflected, and yet never really seeing  the opal as a whole. He was too near it, or too far away; he strained  his eyes and he relaxed his eyes; it was no good. His brain could not  get hold of it.    But there were moments when he almost had it.... and then turned away  from it. He had seen more of life than Bill, but he had never seen  murder before, and this which was in his mind now, and to which he was  afraid to listen, was not just the hot-blooded killing which any man  may come to if he lose control. It was something much more horrible. Too  horrible to be true. Then let him look again for the truth. He looked  again but it was all out of focus.    \"I will not look again,\" he said aloud, as he began to walk towards  the house. \"Not yet, anyway.\" He would go on collecting facts and  impressions. Perhaps the one fact would come along, by itself which  would make everything clear.          CHAPTER XIV. Mr. Beverley Qualifies for the Stage      Bill had come back, and had reported, rather breathless, that Cayley was  still at the pond.    \"But I don't think they're getting up much except mud,\" he said. \"I ran  most of the way back so as to give us as much time as possible.\"    Antony nodded.    \"Well, come along, then,\" he said. \"The sooner, the quicker.\"    They stood in front of the row of sermons. Antony took down the Reverend  Theodore Ussher's famous volume, and felt for the spring. Bill pulled.  The shelves swung open towards them.    \"By Jove!\" said Bill, \"it is a narrow way.\"    There was an opening about a yard square in front of them, which had  something the look of a brick fireplace, a fireplace raised about two  feet from the ground. But, save for one row of bricks in front, the  floor of it was emptiness. Antony took a torch from his pocket and  flashed it down into the blackness.    \"Look,\" he whispered to the eager Bill. \"The steps begin down there. Six  feet down.\"    He flashed his torch up again. There was a handhold of iron, a sort of  large iron staple, in the bricks in front of them.    \"You swing off from there,\" said Bill. \"At least, I suppose you do. I  wonder how Ruth Norris liked doing it.\"    \"Cayley helped her, I should think.... It's funny.\"    \"Shall I go first?\" asked Bill, obviously longing to do so. Antony shook  his head with a smile.    \"I think I will, if you don't mind very much, Bill. Just in case.\"    \"In case of what?\"    \"Well, in case.\"    Bill, had to be content with that, but he was too much excited to wonder  what Antony meant.    \"Righto,\" he said. \"Go on.\"    \"Well, we'll just make sure we can get back again, first. It really  wouldn't be fair on the Inspector if we got stuck down here for the rest  of our lives. He's got enough to do trying to find Mark, but if he has  to find you and me as well--\"    \"We can always get out at the other end.\"    \"Well, we're not certain yet. I think I'd better just go down and back.  I promise faithfully not to explore.\"    \"Right you are.\"    Antony sat down on the ledge of bricks, swung his feet over, and sat  there for a moment, his legs dangling. He flashed his torch into the  darkness again, so as to make sure where the steps began; then returned  it to his pocket, seized the staple in front of him and swung himself  down. His feet touched the steps beneath him, and he let go.    \"Is it all right?\" said Bill anxiously.    \"All right. I'll just go down to the bottom of the steps and back. Stay  there.\"    The light shone down by his feet. His head began to disappear. For  a little while Bill, craning down the opening, could still see faint  splashes of light, and could hear slow uncertain footsteps; for a little  longer he could fancy that he saw and heard them; then he was alone....    Well, not quite alone. There was a sudden voice in the hall outside.    \"Good Lord!\" said Bill, turning round with a start, \"Cayley!\"    If he was not so quick in thought as Antony, he was quick enough in  action. Thought was not demanded now. To close the secret door safely  but noiselessly, to make sure that the books were in the right places,  to move away to another row of shelves so as to be discovered deep in  \"Badminton\" or \"Baedeker\" or whomever the kind gods should send to his  aid the difficulty was not to decide what to do, but to do all this in  five seconds rather than in six.    \"Ah, there you are,\" said Cayley from the doorway.    \"Hallo!\" said Bill, in surprise, looking up from the fourth volume of  \"The Life and Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\" \"Have they finished?\"    \"Finished what?\"    \"The pond,\" said Bill, wondering why he was reading Coleridge on such  a fine afternoon. Desperately he "]]]
