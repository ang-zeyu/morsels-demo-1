Its loss would be irreparable, for there is not a sculptor in  the world capable of making such a beautiful Eros. Remember also, my  father, that this child is Love, and he should not be harshly treated.  Believe me, Love is a virtue, and if I have sinned, it is not through  him, my father, but against him. Never shall I regret aught that he has  caused me to do, and I deplore only those things I have done contrary to  his commands. He does not allow women to give themselves to those who  do not come in his name. For that reason he ought to be honoured. Look,  Paphnutius, how pretty this little Eros is! With what grace he hides  himself in the gardener's beard! One day Nicias, who loved me then,  brought it to me and said, 'It will remind you of me.' But the roguish  boy did not remind me of Nicias, but of a young man I knew at Antioch.  Enough riches have been destroyed upon this pile, my father! Preserve  this Eros, and place it in some monastery. Those who see it will  turn their hearts towards God, for love leads naturally to heavenly  thoughts.\"    The gardener, already believing that the little Eros was saved, smiled  on it as though it had been a child, when Paphnutius, snatching the god  from the arms which held it, threw it into the flames, crying--    \"It is enough that Nicias has touched it to make it replete with every  sort of poison!\"    Then, seizing by armfuls the sparkling robes, the purple mantles, the  golden sandals, the combs, strigils, mirrors, lamps, theorbos, and  lyres, he threw them into this furnace, more costly than the funeral  pile of Sardanapalus, whilst, drunken with the rage of destruction, the  slaves danced round, uttering wild yells amid a shower of sparks and  ashes.    One by one, the neighbours, awakened by the noise, opened the windows,  and rubbing their eyes, looked out to see whence the smoke came. Then  they came down, half dressed, and drew near the fire.    \"What does it mean?\" they wondered.    Amongst them were merchants from whom Thais had often bought perfumes  and stuffs, and they looked on anxiously with long, yellow faces, unable  to comprehend what was going on. Some young debauchees, who, returning  from a supper, passed by there, preceded by their slaves, stopped, their  heads crowned with flowers, their tunics floating, and uttered loud  cries. Attracted by curiosity, the crowd increased unceasingly, and soon  it was known that Thais had been persuaded by the Abbot of Antinoe to  burn her riches and retire to a nunnery.    The shopkeepers thought to themselves--    \"Thais is going to leave the city; we shall sell no more to her; it is  dreadful to think of. What will become of us without her? This monk has  driven her mad. He is ruining us. Why let him do it? What is the use of  the laws? Are there no magistrates in Alexandria? Thais does not think  about us and our wives and our poor children. It is a public scandal.  She ought to be compelled to stay in the city.\"    The young men, on their part, also thought--    \"If Thais is going to renounce acting and love, our chief amusements  will be taken from us. She was the glory, delight, and honour of the  stage. She was the joy even of those who had never possessed her. The  women we loved, we loved in her. There were no kisses given in which she  was altogether absent, for she was the joy of all voluptuaries, and the  mere thought that she breathed amongst us excited us to pleasure.\"    Thus thought the young men, and one of them, named Cerons, who had held  her in his arms, cried out upon the abduction, and blasphemed against  Christ. In every group the conduct of Thais was severely criticised.    \"It is a shameful flight!\"    \"A cowardly desertion!\"    \"She is taking the bread out of our mouths.\"    \"She is robbing our children.\"    \"She ought at least to pay for the wreaths I have sold to her.\"    \"And the sixty robes she has ordered of me.\"    \"She owes money to everybody.\"    \"Who will represent Iphigenia, Electra, and Polyxena when she is gone?  The handsome Polybia herself will not make such a success as she has  done.\"    \"Life will be dull when her door is closed.\"    \"She was the bright star, the soft moon of the Alexandrian sky.\"    All the most notorious mendicants of the city--cripples, blind men,  and paralytics--had by this time assembled in the place; and crawling  through the remnants of the riches, they groaned--    \"How shall we live when Thais is no longer here to feed us? Every day  the fragments from her table fed two hundred poor wretches, and her  lovers, when they quitted her, threw us as they passed handfuls of  silver pieces.\"    Some thieves, too, also mingled with the crowd, and created a deafening  clamour, and pushed their neighbours, to increase disorder, and take  advantage of the tumult to filch some valuable object.    Old Taddeus, who sold Miletan wool and Tarentan linen, and to whom Thais  owed a large sum of money, alone remained calm and silent in the  midst of the uproar. He listened and watched, and gently stroking his  goat-beard, seemed thoughtful. At last he approached young Cerons, and  pulling him by the sleeve, whispered--    \"You are the favoured lover of Thais, handsome youth; show yourself, and  do not allow this monk to carry her off.\"    \"By Pollux and his sister, he shall not!\" cried Cerons. \"I will speak  to Thais, and without flattering myself, I think she will listen to me  rather than to that sooty-faced Lapithan. Place! Place, dogs!\"    And striking with his fist the men, upsetting the old women and treading  on the young children, he reached Thais, and taking her aside--    \"Dearest girl,\" he said, \"look at me, remember, and tell me truly if you  renounce love.\"    But Paphnutius threw himself between Thais and Cerons.    \"Impious wretch!\" he cried, \"beware and touch her not; she is  sacred--she belongs to God.\"    \"Get away, baboon!\" replied the young man furiously. \"Let me speak to my  sweetheart, or if not I will drag your obscene carcase by the beard to  the fire, and roast you like a sausage.\"    And he put his hand on Thais. But, pushed away by the monk with  unexpected force, he staggered back four paces and fell at the foot of  the pile amongst the scattered ashes.    Old Taddeus, meanwhile, had been going from one to the other, pulling  the ears of the slaves and kissing the hands of the masters, inciting  each and all against Paphnutius, and had already formed a little band  resolutely determined to oppose the monk who would steal Thais from  them.    Cerons rose, his face black, his hair singed, and choking with smoke  and rage. He blasphemed against the gods, and threw himself amongst the  assailants, behind whom the beggars crawled, shaking their crutches.  Paphnutius was soon enclosed in a circle of menacing fists, raised  sticks, and cries of death.    \"To the ravens with the monk! to the ravens!\"    \"No; throw him in the fire! Burn him alive!\"    Seizing his fair prey, he pressed her to his heart.    \"Impious men,\" he cried in a voice of thunder, \"strive not to tear the  dove from the eagle of the Lord. But rather copy this woman, and like  she turn your filth into gold. Imitate her example, and renounce the  false wealth which you think you hold and which holds you. Hasten!  the day is at hand, and divine patience begins to grow weary. Repent,  confess your sins, weep and pray. Walk in the footsteps of Thais. Hate  your offenses, which are as great as hers. Which of you, poor or rich,  merchants, soldiers, slaves or eminent citizens, would dare to say,  before God, that he was better than a prostitute? You are all nothing  but living filth, and it is by a miracle of divine goodness that you do  not suddenly turn into streams of mire.\"    Whilst he spoke flames shot from his eyes; an it seemed as though live  coals came from his lips and those who surrounded him were obliged to  hear him in spite of themselves.    But old Taddeus did not remain idle. He picked up stones and oyster  shells, which he hid in the skirt of his tunic, and not daring to throw  them himself slipped them into the hands of the beggars. Soon the stones  began to fly, and a well-directed shell cut Paphnutius' face. The blood,  which flowed down the dark face of the martyr, dropped in a new baptism  on the head of the penitent, and Thais, half stifled in the monk's  embrace and her delicate skin scratched by the coarse cassock, felt a  thrill of horror and fright.    At that moment a man elegantly dressed, and with a wreath of wild celery  on his head, opened a road for himself through the furious crowd, and  cried--    \"Stop! Stop! This monk is my brother!\"    It was Nicias, who, having closed the eyes of the philosopher Eucrites,  was passing through the square to return to his house, and saw, without  very much surprise (for nothing astonished him), the smoking pile, Thais  clad an a serge cassock, and Paphnutius being stoned.    He repeated--    \"Stop, I tell you; spare my old fellow-scholar; respect the beloved head  of Paphnutius!\"    But, being only used to subtle disquisitions with philosophers, he did  not possess that imperious energy which commands vulgar minds. He was  not listened to. A shower of stones and shells fell on the monk, who,  protecting Thais with his body, praised the Lord whose goodness turned  his wounds into caresses. Despairing of making himself heard, and  feeling but too sure that he could not save his friend either by force  or persuasion, Nicias resigned himself to the will of the gods--in  whom he had little confidence--when the idea occurred to him to use a  stratagem which his contempt for men had suddenly suggested to him. He  took from his girdle his purse, which was full of gold and silver, for  he was a pleasure-loving and charitable man, and running up to the men  who were throwing the stones, he chinked the money in their ears. At  first they paid no attention to him, their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781"],[0,"Heidi (#20)"],[1,"-trees  tempted her again. The grandfather had been busy in his little shop,  merely glancing over at the child from time to time. Suddenly he heard  her call: \"Oh grandfather, come!\"    He was frightened and came out quickly He saw her running down the  hill crying: \"They are coming, they are coming. Oh, the doctor is  coming first.\"       [Illustration: THEY ARE COMING, OH, THE DOCTOR IS COMING FIRST]    When Heidi at last reached her old friend, he held out his hand, which  Heidi immediately seized. In the full joy of her heart, she exclaimed:  \"How do you do, doctor? And I thank you a thousand times!\"    \"How are you, Heidi? But what are you thanking me for already?\" the  doctor asked, with a smile.    \"Because you let me come home again,\" the child explained.    The gentleman's face lit up like sunshine. He had certainly not  counted on such a reception on the Alp. On the contrary! Not even  noticing all the beauty around him, he had climbed up sadly, for he  was sure that Heidi probably would not know him any more. He thought  that he would be far from welcome, being obliged to cause her a great  disappointment. Instead, he beheld Heidi's bright eyes looking up at  him in gratefulness and love. She was still holding his arm, when he  said: \"Come now, Heidi, and take me to your grandfather, for I want  to see where you live.\"    Like a kind father he had taken her hand, but Heidi stood still and  looked down the mountain-side.    \"But where are Clara and grandmama?\" she asked.    \"Child, I must tell you something now which will grieve you as much as  it grieves me,\" replied the doctor. \"I had to come alone, for Clara  has been very ill and could not travel. Of course grandmama has not  come either; but the spring will soon be here, and when the days get  long and warm, they will surely visit you.\"    Heidi was perfectly amazed; she could not understand how all those  things that she had pictured to herself so clearly would not happen  after all. She was standing perfectly motionless, confused by the  blow.    It was some time before Heidi remembered that, after all, she had come  down to meet the doctor. Looking up at her friend, she was struck by  his sad and cheerless face. How changed he was since she had seen  him! She did not like to see people unhappy, least of all the good,  kind doctor. He must be sad because Clara and grandmama had not come,  and to console him she said: \"Oh, it won't last long till spring comes  again; then they will come for sure; they'll be able to stay much  longer then, and that will please Clara. Now we'll go to grandfather.\"    Hand in hand she climbed up with her old friend. All the way she tried  to cheer him up by telling him again and again of the coming summer  days. After they had reached the cottage, she called out to her  grandfather quite happily:    \"They are not here yet, but it won't be very long before they are  coming!\"    The grandfather warmly welcomed his guest, who did not seem at all a  stranger, for had not Heidi told him many things about the doctor?  They all three sat down on the bench before the door, and the doctor  told of the object of his visit. He whispered to the child that  something was coming up the mountain very soon which would bring her  more pleasure than his visit. What could it be?    The uncle advised the doctor to spend the splendid days of autumn on  the Alp, if possible, and to take a little room in the village instead  of in Ragatz; then he could easily walk up every day to the hut, and  from there the uncle could take him all around the mountains. This  plan was accepted.    The sun was in its zenith and the wind had ceased. Only a soft  delicious breeze fanned the cheeks of all.    The uncle now got up and went into the hut, returning soon with a  table and their dinner.    \"Go in, Heidi, and set the table here. I hope you will excuse our  simple meal,\" he said, turning to his guest.    \"I shall gladly accept this delightful invitation; I am sure that  dinner will taste good up here,\" said the guest, looking down over the  sun-bathed valley.    Heidi was running to and fro, for it gave her great joy to be able to  wait on her kind protector. Soon the uncle appeared with the steaming  milk, the toasted cheese, and the finely-sliced, rosy meat that had  been dried in the pure air. The doctor enjoyed his dinner better than  any he had ever tasted.    \"Yes, we must send Clara up here. How she could gather strength!\" he  said; \"If she would have an appetite like mine to-day, she couldn't  help getting nice and fat.\"    At this moment a man could be seen walking up with a large sack on his  shoulders. Arriving on top, he threw down his load, breathing in the  pure, fresh air.    Opening the cover, the doctor said: \"This has come for you from  Frankfurt, Heidi. Come and look what is in it.\"    Heidi timidly watched the heap, and only when the gentleman opened the  box with the cakes for the grandmother she said joyfully: \"Oh, now  grandmother can eat this lovely cake.\" She was taking the box and the  beautiful shawl on her arm and was going to race down to deliver the  gifts, when the men persuaded her to stay and unpack the rest. What  was her delight at finding the tobacco and all the other things. The  men had been talking together, when the child suddenly planted herself  in front of them and said: \"These things have not given me as much  pleasure as the dear doctor's coming.\" Both men smiled.    When it was near sunset, the doctor rose to start on his way down. The  grandfather, carrying the box, the shawl and the sausage, and the  guest holding the little girl by the hand, they wandered down the  mountain-side. When they reached Peter's hut, Heidi was told to go  inside and wait for her grandfather there. At parting she asked:  \"Would you like to come with me up to the pasture to-morrow, doctor?\"    \"With pleasure. Good-bye, Heidi,\" was the reply. The grandfather had  deposited all the presents before the door, and it took Heidi long to  carry in the huge box and the sausage. The shawl she put on the  grandmother's knee.    Brigida had silently watched the proceedings, and could not open her  eyes wide enough when she saw the enormous sausage. Never in her life  had she seen the like, and now she really possessed it and could cut  it herself.    \"Oh grandmother, don't the cakes please you awfully? Just look how  soft they are!\" the child exclaimed. What was her amazement when she  saw the grandmother more pleased with the shawl, which would keep her  warm in winter.    \"Grandmother, Clara has sent you that,\" Heidi said.    \"Oh, what kind good people they are to think of a poor old woman like  me! I never thought I should ever own such a splendid wrap.\"    At this moment Peter came stumbling in.    \"The uncle is coming up behind me, and Heidi must--\" that was as far  as he got, for his eyes had fastened on the sausage. Heidi, however,  had already said good-bye, for she knew what he had meant. Though her  uncle never went by the hut any more without stepping in, she knew it  was too late to-day. \"Heidi, come, you must get your sleep,\" he called  through the open door. Bidding them all good-night, he took Heidi by  the hand and under the glistening stars they wandered home to their  peaceful cottage.    [Illustration]          XVII    RETALIATION      Early the next morning the doctor climbed up the mountain in company  with Peter and his goats. The friendly gentleman made several attempts  to start a conversation with the boy, but as answer to his questions  he got nothing more than monosyllables. When they arrived on top, they  found Heidi already waiting, fresh and rosy as the early dawn.    \"Are you coming?\" asked Peter as usual.    \"Of course I shall, if the doctor comes with us,\" replied the child.    The grandfather, coming out of the hut, greeted the newcomer with  great respect. Then he went up to Peter, and hung on his shoulder the  sack, which seemed to contain more than usual that day.    When they had started on their way, Heidi kept urging forward the  goats, which were crowding about her. When at last she was walking  peacefully by the doctor's side, she began to relate to him many  things about the goats and all their strange pranks, and about the  flowers, rocks and birds they saw. When they arrived at their  destination, time seemed to have flown. Peter all the time was sending  many an angry glance at the unconscious doctor, who never even noticed  it.    Heidi now took the doctor to her favorite spot. From there they could  hear the peaceful-sounding bells of the grazing cattle below. The sky  was deep blue, and above their heads the eagle was circling with  outstretched wings. Everything was luminous and bright about them, but  the doctor had been silent. Suddenly looking up, he beheld Heidi's  radiant eyes.    \"Heidi, it is beautiful up here,\" he said. \"But how can anybody with a  heavy heart enjoy the beauty? Tell me!\"    \"Oh,\" exclaimed Heidi, \"one never has a sad heart here. One only gets  unhappy in Frankfurt.\"    A faint smile passed over the doctor's face. Then he began: \"But if  somebody has brought his sorrow away with him, how would you comfort  him?\"    \"God in Heaven alone can help him.\"    \"That is true, child,\" remarked the doctor. \"But what can we do when  God Himself has sent us the affliction?\"    After meditating a moment, Heidi replied: \"One must wait patiently,  for God knows how to turn the saddest things to something happy in the  end. God will show us what He has meant to do for us. But He will only  do so if we pray to Him patiently.\"    \"I hope you will always keep this beautiful belief, Heidi,\" said the  doctor. Then looking up at the mighty cliffs above, he continued:  \"Think how sad it would make us not to be able to see all these  beautiful things. Wouldn't that make us doubly sad? Can you understand  me, child?\"    A great pain shot through Heidi's breast. She had to think"]]]
