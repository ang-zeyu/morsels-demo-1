An' when the Crittenden yooth returns, he brings  with him the Rickett boys an' forty added dogs. Which it's worth a  ten-mile ride to get a glimpse of that outfit of canines! Thar's every  sort onder the canopy: thar's the stolid hound, the alert fice, the  sapient collie; that is thar's individyool beasts wherein the hound, or  fice, or collie seems to preedominate as a strain. The trooth is thar's  not that dog a-whinin' about our hosses' fetlocks who ain't proudly  descended from fifteen different tribes, an' they shorely makes a motley  mass meetin'. Still, they're good, zealous dogs; an' as they're going to  go for'ard an' take most of the resks of that panther, it seems  invidious to criticize 'em.    \"'One of the Twitty boys rides down an' puts the eighty or more dogs  into the bresh. The rest of us lays back an' strains our eyes. Thar he  is! A shout goes up as we descries the panther stealin' off by a far  corner. He's headin' along a hollow that's full of bresh an' baby timber  an' runs parallel with the pike. Big an' yaller he is; we can tell from  the slight flash we gets of him as he darts into a second clump of  bushes. With a cry--what young Crittenden calls a \"view halloo,\"--we  goes stampeedin' down the pike in pursoot.    \"'Our dogs is sta'nch; they shore does themse'fs proud. Singin' in  twenty keys, reachin' from growls to yelps an' from yelps to shrillest  screams, they pushes dauntlessly on the fresh trail of their terrified  quarry. Now an' then we gets a squint of the panther as he skulks from  one copse to another jest ahead. Which he's goin' like a arrow; no  mistake! As for us Chevy Chasers, we parallels the hunt, an' continyoos  poundin' the Skinner turnpike abreast of the pack, ever an' anon givin'  a encouragin' shout as we briefly sights our game.    \"'Gents,' says Colonel Sterett, as he ag'in refreshes hims'ef, 'it's  needless to go over that hunt in detail. We hustles the flyin' demon  full eighteen miles, our faithful dogs crowdin' close an' breathless at  his coward heels. Still, they don't catch up with him; he streaks it  like some saffron meteor.    \"'Only once does we approach within strikin' distance; that's when he  crosses at old Stafford's whisky still. As he glides into view,  Crittenden shouts:    \"'\"Thar he goes!\"    \"'For myse'f I'm prepared. I've got one of these misguided cap-an'-ball  six-shooters that's built doorin' the war; an' I cuts that hardware  loose! This weapon seems a born profligate of lead, for the six chambers  goes off together. Which you should have seen the Chevy Chasers dodge!  An' well they may; that broadside ain't in vain! My aim is so troo that  one of the r'armost dogs evolves a howl an' rolls over; then he sets up  gnawin' an' lickin' his off hind laig in frantic alternations. That hunt  is done for him. We leaves him doctorin' himse'f an' picks him up two  hours later on our triumphant return.    \"'As I states, we harries that foogitive panther for eighteen miles an'  in our hot ardor founders two hosses. Fatigue an' weariness begins to  overpower us; also our prey weakens along with the rest. In the half  glimpses we now an' ag'in gets of him it's plain that both pace an'  distance is tellin' fast. Still, he presses on; an' as thar's no spur  like fear, that panther holds his distance.    \"'But the end comes. We've done run him into a rough, wild stretch of  country where settlements is few an' cabins roode. Of a sudden, the  panther emerges onto the road an' goes rackin' along the trail. We  pushes our spent steeds to the utmost.    \"'Thar's a log house ahead; out in the stump-filled lot in front is a  frowsy woman an' five small children. The panther leaps the rickety  worm-fence an' heads straight as a bullet for the cl'arin! Horrors! the  sight freezes our marrows! Mad an' savage, he's doo to bite a hunk outen  that devoted household! Mutooally callin' to each other, we goads our  horses to the utmost. We gain on the panther! He may wound but he won't  have time to slay that fam'ly.    \"'Gents, it's a soopreme moment! The panther makes for the female  squatter an' her litter, we pantin' an' pressin' clost behind. The  panther is among 'em; the woman an' the children seems transfixed by the  awful spectacle an' stands rooted with open eyes an' mouths. Our  emotions shore beggars deescriptions.    \"'Now ensooes a scene to smite the hardiest of us with dismay. No sooner  does the panther find himse'f in the midst of that he'pless bevy of  little ones, than he stops, turns round abrupt, an' sets down on his  tail; an' then upliftin' his muzzle he busts into shrieks an' yells an'  howls an' cries, a complete case of dog hysterics! That's what he is, a  great yeller dog; his reason is now a wrack because we harasses him the  eighteen miles.    \"'Thar's a ugly outcast of a squatter, mattock in hand, comes tumblin'  down the hillside from some'ers out back of the shanty where he's been  grubbin':    \"'\"What be you-all eediots chasin' my dog for?\" demands this onkempt  party. Then he menaces us with the implement.    \"'We makes no retort but stands passive. The great orange brute whose  nerves has been torn to rags creeps to the squatter an' with mournful  howls explains what we've made him suffer.    \"'No, thar's nothin' further to do an' less to be said. That cavalcade,  erstwhile so gala an' buoyant, drags itself wearily homeward, the  exhausted dogs in the r'ar walkin' stiff an' sore like their laigs is  wood. For more'n a mile the complainin' howls of the hysterical yeller  dog is wafted to our years. Then they ceases; an' we figgers his  sympathizin' master has done took him into the shanty an' shet the door.    \"'No one comments on this adventure, not a word is heard. Each is silent  ontil we mounts the Big Murray hill. As we collects ourse'fs on this  eminence one of the Brackenridge boys holds up his hand for a halt.  \"Gents,\" he says, as--hosses, hunters an' dogs--we-all gathers 'round,  \"gents, I moves you the Chevy Chase Huntin' Club yereby stands adjourned  _sine die_.\" Thar's a moment's pause, an' then as by one impulse every  gent, hoss an' dog, says \"Ay!\" It's yoonanimous, an' from that hour till  now the Chevy Chase Huntin' Club ain't been nothin' save tradition. But  that panther shore disappears; it's the end of his vandalage; an' ag'in  does quadrilles, pra'rs, an poker resoom their wonted sway. That's the  end; an' now, gents, if Black Jack will caper to his dooties we'll  uplift our drooped energies with the usual forty drops.'\"          WOUTER VAN TWILLER    BY WASHINGTON IRVING      It was in the year of our Lord 1629 that Mynheer Wouter Van Twiller was  appointed governor of the province of Nieuw Nederlandts, under the  commission and control of their High Mightinesses the Lords States  General of the United Netherlands, and the privileged West India  Company.    This renowned old gentleman arrived at New Amsterdam in the merry month  of June, the sweetest month in all the year; when dan Apollo seems to  dance up the transparent firmament,--when the robin, the thrush, and a  thousand other wanton songsters make the woods to resound with amorous  ditties, and the luxurious little bob-lincoln revels among the  clover-blossoms of the meadows,--all which happy coincidence persuaded  the old dames of New Amsterdam, who were skilled in the art of  foretelling events, that this was to be a happy and prosperous  administration.    The renowned Wouter (or Walter) Van Twiller was descended from a long  line of Dutch burgomasters, who had successively dozed away their lives  and grown fat upon the bench of magistracy in Rotterdam; and who had  comported themselves with such singular wisdom and propriety, that they  were never either heard or talked of--which, next to being universally  applauded, should be the object of ambition of all magistrates and  rulers. There are two opposite ways by which some men make a figure in  the world; one, by talking faster than they think, and the other, by  holding their tongues and not thinking at all. By the first, many a  smatterer acquires the reputation of a man of quick parts; by the other,  many a dunderpate, like the owl, the stupidest of birds, comes to be  considered the very type of wisdom. This, by the way, is a casual  remark, which I would not, for the universe, have it thought I apply to  Governor Van Twiller. It is true he was a man shut up within himself,  like an oyster, and rarely spoke, except in monosyllables; but then it  was allowed he seldom said a foolish thing. So invincible was his  gravity that he was never known to laugh or even to smile through the  whole course of a long and prosperous life. Nay, if a joke were uttered  in his presence, that set light-minded hearers in a roar, it was  observed to throw him into a state of perplexity. Sometimes he would  deign to inquire into the matter, and when, after much explanation, the  joke was made as plain as a pike-staff, he would continue to smoke his  pipe in silence, and at length, knocking out the ashes, would exclaim,  \"Well, I see nothing in all that to laugh about.\"    With all his reflective habits, he never made up his mind on a subject.  His adherents accounted for this by the astonishing magnitude of his  ideas. He conceived every subject on so grand a scale that he had not  room in his head to turn it over and examine both sides of it. Certain  it is, that if any matter were propounded to him on which ordinary  mortals would rashly determine at first glance, he would put on a vague,  mysterious look, shake his capacious head, smoke some time in profound  silence, and at length observe, that \"he had his doubts about the  matter\";"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18477"],[0,"The Science of Human Nature (#20)"],[1,"structure  that he himself is to build. Life will be what he makes it, and the time  for forming character is during early years. The parent must not only  tell the child this but must help him to realize the truth of it, must  help him continually, consistently.    (4) Of course it is hardly necessary to say that the parent can help  much, perhaps most, by example. The parent must not only tell the child  what to do but must _show_ him how it should be done.    (5) Parents can help in the ways mentioned above, but they can also help  by cooeperating among themselves in planning for the training of the  children of the community. One parent cannot train his children  independently of all the other people in the community. There must be a  certain unity of ideals and aims. Therefore, not only is there need for  cooeperation between parents and teachers but among parents themselves.  Although they cooeperate in everything else, they seldom do in the  training of their children. The people of a community should meet  together occasionally to plan for this common work.    =Importance of Habit in Education and Life.= A man is the sum of his  habits and ideals. He has language habits; he speaks German, or French,  or English. He has writing habits, spelling habits, reading habits,  arithmetic habits. He has political habits, religious habits. He has  various social habits, habitual attitudes which he takes toward his  fellows. He has moral habits--he is honest and truthful, or he is  dishonest and untruthful. He always looks on the bright side, or else on  the dark side of events. All these habits and many more, he has. They  are structures which he has built. One's life, then, is the sum of his  tendencies, and these tendencies one establishes in early life.    This view gives an importance to the work of the school which is derived  from no other view. The school is not a place where we get this little  bit of information, or the other. It is the place where we are molded,  formed, and shaped into the beings we are to be. The school has not  risen to see the real importance of its work. Its aims have been low and  its achievements much lower than its aims. Teachers should rise to the  importance of their calling. Their work is that of gods. They are  creators. They do not make the child. They do not give it memory or  attention or imagination. But they are creators of tendencies,  prejudices, religions, politics, and other habits unnumbered. So that in  a very real sense, the school, with all the other educational  influences, makes the man. We do not give a child the capacity to learn,  but we can determine what he shall learn. We do not give him memory, but  we can select what he shall remember. We do not make the child as he is  at the beginning, but we can, in large measure, determine the world of  influences which complete the task of _making_.    In the early part of life every day and every hour of the day  establishes and strengthens tendencies. Every year these tendencies  become stronger. Every year after maturity, we resist change. By  twenty-five or thirty, \"character has set like plaster.\" The general  attitude and view of the world which we have at maturity, we are to hold  throughout life. Very few men fundamentally change after this. It takes  a tremendous influence and an unusual situation to break one up and make  him an essentially different man after maturity. Every year a \"crank\"  becomes \"crankier.\"    It is well that this is so. Everything in the world costs its price.  Rigidity is the price we pay for efficiency. In order to be efficient,  we must make habitual the necessary movements. After they are  habituated, they resist change. But habit makes for regularity and  order. We could not live in society unless there were regularity,  order, fixity. Habit makes for conservatism. But conservatism is  necessary for order. In a sense, habit works against progress. But  permanent improvement without habit would be impossible, for permanent  progress depends upon holding what we gain. It is well for society that  we are conservative. We could not live in the chaos that would exist  without habit. Public opinion resists change. People refuse to accept a  view that is different from the one they have held. We could get nowhere  if we continually changed, and it is well for us that we continue to do  the old way to which we have become accustomed, till a new and better  one is shown beyond doubt. Even then, it is probably better for an old  person to continue to use the accustomed methods of a lifetime. Although  better methods are developed, they will not be so good for the old  person as those modes of action that he is used to. The possibility of  progress is through new methods which come in with each succeeding  generation.    When we become old we are not willing to change, but the more reasonable  of us are willing that our children should be taught a better way.  Sometimes, of course, we find people who say that what was good enough  for them is good enough for their children. Most of us think better, and  wish to give our children a \"better bringing up than ours has been.\"    These considerations make clear the importance of habit in life. They  should also make clear a very important corollary. If habits are  important in life, then it is the duty of parents and teachers to make a  careful selection of the habits that are to be formed by the children.  The habits that will be necessary for the child to form in order to meet  the various situations of his future life, should be determined. There  should be no vagueness about it. Definite habits, social, moral,  religious, intellectual, professional, etc., will be necessary for  efficiency. We should know what these various habits are, and should  then set about the work of establishing them with system and  determination, just as we would the building of a house. Much school  work and much home training is vague, indefinite, uncertain, done  without a clear understanding of the needs or of the results. We  therefore waste time, years of the child's life, and the results are  unsatisfactory.    =Drill in School Subjects.= In many school subjects, the main object is to  acquire skill in certain processes. As previously explained, we can  become skillful in an act only by repetition of the act. Therefore, in  those subjects in which the main object is the acquiring of skill, there  must be much repetition. This repetition is called drill. The matter of  economical procedure in drill has already been considered, but there are  certain problems connected with drill that must be further discussed.    Drill is usually the hardest part of school work. It becomes monotonous  and tiresome. Moreover, drill is always a means. It is the means by  which we become efficient. Take writing, for example. It is not an end  in itself; it is the means by which we convey thoughts. Reading is a  means by which we are able to get the thought of another. In acquiring a  foreign language, we have first to master the elementary tools that will  enable us to make the thought of the foreign language our own.    It seems that the hardest part of education always comes first, when we  are least able to do it. It used to be that nearly all the work of the  school was drill. There was little school work that was interesting in  itself. In revolt against this kind of school, many modern educators  have tried to plan a curriculum that would be interesting to the child.  In schools that follow this idea, there is little or no drill, pure and  simple. There is no work that is done for the sole purpose of acquiring  skill. The work is so planned that, in pursuing it, the child will of  necessity have to perform the necessary acts and will thereby gain  efficiency. In arithmetic, there is no adding, subtracting, multiplying,  or dividing, only as such things must be done in the performance of  something else that is interesting in itself. For example, the child  plays store and must add up the sales. The child plays bean bag and must  add up the score. Practice gained in this indirect way is known as  incidental drill. Direct drill consists in making a direct approach; we  wish to be efficient at adding, so we practice adding as such and not  merely as incidental to something else.    This plan of incidental drill is in harmony with the principle of  interest previously explained. There are several things, however, that  must be considered. The proper procedure would seem to be to look  forward and find out in what directions the child will need to acquire  skill and then to help him acquire it in the most economical way and at  the proper time. Nature has so made us that we like to do a new trick.  When we have taught a child how to add and subtract, he likes to perform  these operations because the operations themselves give pleasure.  Therefore much repetition can be allowed and much skill acquired by a  direct approach to the practice. When interest drags, incidental drill  can be fallen back upon to help out the interest. Children should be  taught that certain things must be done, certain skill must be acquired.  They should accept some things on the authority of elders. They should  be taught to apply themselves and to give their whole attention to a  thing that must be done. A desire for efficiency can be developed in  them. The spirit of competition can sometimes be effectively used to add  interest to drill. Of course, interest and attention there must be, and  if it cannot be secured in one way, it must be in another.    Experiments have abundantly shown the value of formal drill, that is to  say, drill for drill's sake. If an arithmetic class is divided, one half  being given a few minutes' drill on the fundamental operations each day  but otherwise doing exactly the same work as the other half of the  class, the half receiving the drill acquires much more"]]]
