In connexion with the former of these issues, we have to consider here  not whether that form of intellectual co-operation in which the man  plays the game, and the woman moves the pawns under his orders, is  possible. That form of co-operation is of course possible, and it has,  doubtless, certain utilities.    Nor yet have we to consider whether quite intimate and purely  intellectual association on an equal footing between a particular man  and a selected woman may or may not be possible. It will suffice to  note that the feminist alleges that this also is possible; but  everybody knows that the woman very often marries the man.    What we have to ask is whether--even if we leave out of regard the  whole system of attractions or, as the case may be, repulsions which  come into operation when the sexes are thrown together--purely  intellectual intercourse between man and the typical unselected woman  is not barred by the intellectual immoralities and limitations which  appear to be secondary sexual characters of woman.    With regard to this issue, there would seem to be very little real  difference of opinion among men. But there are great differences in  the matter of candour. There are men who speak out, and who enunciate  like Nietzsche that \"man and woman are alien--never yet has any one  conceived how alien.\"    There are men who, from motives of delicacy or policy, do not speak  out--averse to saying anything that might be unflattering to woman.    And there are men who are by their profession of the feminist faith  debarred from speaking out, but who upon occasion give themselves  away.    Of such is the man who in the House of Commons champions the cause of  woman's suffrage, impassionately appealing to Justice; and then  betrays himself by announcing that he would shake off from his feet  the dust of its purlieus if ever women were admitted as  members--_i.e._ if ever women were forced upon _him_ as close  intellectual associates.    Wherever we look we find aversion to compulsory intellectual  co-operation with woman. We see it in the sullen attitude which the  ordinary male student takes up towards the presence of women students  in his classes. We see it in the fact that the older English  universities, which have conceded everything else to women, have made  a strong stand against making them actual members of the university;  for this would impose them on men as intellectual associates. Again we  see the aversion in the opposition to the admission of women to the  bar. But we need not look so far afield. Practically every man feels  that there is in woman--patent, or hidden away--an element of unreason  which, when you come upon it, summarily puts an end to purely  intellectual intercourse. One may reflect, for example, upon the way  the woman's suffrage controversy has been conducted.    Proceeding now on the assumption that these things are so, and that  man feels that he and woman belong to different intellectual castes,  we come now to the question as to whether it is man who is selfish  when he excludes women from his institutions, or woman when she  unceasingly importunes for admittance. And we may define as _selfish_  all such conduct as pursues the advantage of the agent at the cost of  the happiness and welfare of the general body of mankind.    We shall be in a better position to pronounce judgment on this  question of ethics when we have considered the following series of  analogies:    When a group of earnest and devout believers meet together for special  intercession and worship, we do not tax them with selfishness if they  exclude unbelievers.    Nor do we call people who are really devoted to music selfish if,  coming together for this, they make a special point of excluding the  unmusical.    Nor again would the imputation of selfishness lie against members of a  club for black-balling a candidate who would, they feel, be  uncongenial.    Nor should we regard it as an act of selfishness if the members of a  family circle, or of the same nation, or of any social circle, desired  to come together quite by themselves.    Nor yet would the term selfish apply to an East End music hall  audience when they eject any one who belongs to a different social  class to themselves and wears good clothes.    And the like would hold true of servants resenting their employers  intruding upon them in their hours of leisure or entertainments.    If we do not characterise such exclusions as selfish, but rather  respect and sympathise with them, it is because we recognise that the  whole object and _raison d' etre_ of association would in each case be  nullified by the weak-minded admission of the incompatible intruder.    We recognise that if any charge of selfishness would lie, it would lie  against that intruder.    Now if this holds in the case where the interests of religious worship  or music, or family, national, or social life, or recreation and  relaxation after labour are in question, it will hold true even more  emphatically where the interests of intellectual work are involved.    But the feminist will want to argue.  She will--taking it as always  for granted that woman has a right to all that men's hands or brains  have fashioned--argue that it is very important for the intellectual  development of woman that she should have exactly the same  opportunities as man. And she will, scouting [rejecting with contempt]  the idea of any differences between the intelligences of man and  woman, discourse to you of their intimate affinity.    It will, perhaps, be well to clear up these points.    The importance of the higher development of woman is unquestionable.    But after all it is the intellect of man which really comes into  account in connexion with \"the mass of mental faculties available for  the higher service of mankind.\"    The maintenance of the conditions which allow of man's doing his best  intellectual work is therefore an interest which is superior to that  of the intellectual development of woman. And woman might quite  properly be referred for her intellectual development to instructional  institutions which should be special to herself.    Coming to the question of the intimate resemblances between the  masculine and the feminine intelligence, no man would be venturesome  enough to dispute these, but he may be pardoned if he thinks--one  would hope in no spirit of exaltation--also of the differences.    We have an instructive analogy in connexion with the learned  societies.    It is uncontrovertible that every candidate for election into such a  society will have, and will feel that he has, affinities with the  members of that association. And he is invited to set these forth in  his application. But there may also be differences of which he is not  sensible. On that question the electors are the judges; and they are  the final court of appeal.    There would seem to be here a moral which the feminist would do well  to lay to heart.    There is also another lesson which she might very profitably consider.  A quite small difference will often constitute as effective a bar to a  useful and congenial co-operation as a more fundamental difference.    In the case of a body of intellectual workers one might at first sight  suppose that so small a distinction as that of belonging to a  different nationality--sex, of course, is an infinitely profounder  difference--would not be a bar to unrestricted intellectual  co-operation.    But in point of fact it is in every country, in every learned society,  a uniform rule that when foreign scientists or scholars are admitted  they are placed not on the ordinary list of working members, but on a  special list.    One discerns that there is justification for this in the fact that a  foreigner would in certain eventualities be an incompatible person.    One may think of the eventuality of the learned society deciding to  recognise a national service, or to take part in a national movement.  And one is not sure that a foreigner might not be an incompatible  person in the eventuality of a scientist or scholar belonging to a  nationality with which the foreigner's country was at feud being  brought forward for election. And he would, of course, be an  impossible person in a society if he were, in a spirit of chauvinism,  to press for a larger representation of his own fellow-countrymen.    Now this is precisely the kind of way man feels about woman.  He  recognises that she is by virtue of her sex for certain purposes an  incompatible person; and that, quite apart from this, her secondary  sexual characters might in certain eventualities make her an  impossible person.    We may note, before passing on, that these considerations would seem  to prescribe that woman should be admitted to masculine institutions  only when real humanitarian grounds demand it; that she  should--following here the analogy of what is done in the learned  societies with respect to foreigners--be invited to co-operate with  men only when she is quite specially eminent, or beyond all question  useful for the particular purpose in hand; and lastly, that when  co-opted into any masculine institution woman should always be placed  upon a special list, to show that it was proposed to confine her  co-operation within certain specified limits.    From these general questions, which affect only the woman with  intellectual aspirations, we pass to consider what would be the effect  of feminism upon the rank and file of women if it made of these  co-partners with man in work. They would suffer not only because  woman's physiological disabilities and the restrictions which arise  out of her sex place her at a great disadvantage when she has to enter  into competition with man, but also because under feminism man would  be less and less disposed to take off woman's shoulders a part of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#13)"],[1,"ever been on. If you can drop in and  visit Miss Briggs and myself on Saturday after lunch at our place, I'll  give you a fill-in that will rock the F.B.I. from its gats to its  toupees.\"    \"That's mighty white of you--and Miss Briggs,\" the Special Agent  allowed. \"If the chief lets me, I'll meet you up there, say about 2:30.\"    \"Swell!\" I said. \"And which do you prefer--Scotch or rye?\"    \"I don't drink on duty,\" he told me, \"but I find Bourbon helps fight  off colds this early spring weather.\"    After his departure, I locked myself in the office and with  Arthurjean's help, brought myself up to date on Winnie's business  operations. Tompkins, Wasson & Cone were not, as I had believed, a  high-toned bucket-shop. The proposed Fynch swindle was only the result  of a dopey old maid who practically insisted on helping beat the Axis  by turning her money into Government bonds. There was plenty of honest  graft and many a solid perquisite in straight commission work and  supervision of estates. The firm was not, of course, very scrupulous  but it always gave value for its transactions. It was, in fact, a  pretty slick set-up.    There was a buzz on my inter-office telephone and the receptionist  announced: \"Mr. Axel Roscommon to see you, Mr. Tompkins.\"    \"Oh, ask him to see one of the other partners, will you?\"    \"I told him that you were too busy, but he said he must see you and  would wait.\"    \"He too?\" I asked. \"Okay. Send him in. Do you know an Axel Roscommon,  Arthurjean?\"    \"Uh-uh!\" She shook her head. \"The name's sorta familiar. Something in  oil before Pearl Harbor. I can find out if you'll wait a bit.\"    \"Never mind,\" I told her. \"I'll see him. You stay in the next room and  keep the door ajar so you can take a record.\"    She laughed. \"I can do better than that, boss. I'll switch down the  inter-office phones and keep the door shut. That way. I'll hear every  word you say. It's like a dictaphone.\"    Mr. Roscommon was an extremely well set up man in the middle fifties,  about six-feet two, lean, with iron grey hair, a grey moustache,  steel-blue eyes and a bear-trap grip. He looked prosperous but not  worried by it. He spoke with a faint Irish lilt in his voice but his  manner was most direct and unHibernian.    \"Mr. Tompkins,\" he remarked. \"You must excuse the lack of formality  but you will understand when I tell you that I am chief of the German  intelligence organization in the United States. Now don't think I'm  crazy or indiscreet. The only reason I have come to you is because my  agents in the F.B.I. tell me that you are involved in the sinking of  U.S.S. Alaska off the Aleutians. Thorium bombs, wasn't it? Chalmis was  a pretty smart chap and I warned our people that he was getting hot.  Now I don't ask you why in Wotan's name the Fuehrer thinks it makes  sense to have two intelligence services in this country. Probably  Berlin didn't like my last reports. No, don't get excited. I've engaged  in no subversive activities, I'm an Irish Free State citizen and if you  go to Washington you'll find that they know all about me. Hitler may  want the old Goetterdaemmerung spirit in our outfit but I can't see the  point of too much zeal.\"    I offered him a cigarette. \"What do you want to see me about, Mr.  Roscommon?\" I asked. \"For all you know there may be dictaphones planted  all over the place. My last visitor today was actually a special agent  of the F.B.I.\"    Roscommon lighted his cigarette with a flick of a gold Dunhill lighter.  \"That would be Harcourt--A. J. Harcourt--wouldn't it? A fine chap and  a conscientious agent. I'd heard he'd been assigned to your case.  You'll find him completely reliable. As you know, in time of war there  has to be _some_ practical way of maintaining direct confidential  communication between the enemies. Switzerland? Bah! All milk  chocolate, profiteering and eyewash. I wouldn't trust a Swiss as far as  I could throw the Sub-Treasury Building. I'm acting here for Berlin and  you have at least three men in Berlin to keep in touch with the German  Government over there. That's the only practical way modern wars can be  fought, eh? As Edith Cavell said last time, 'Patriotism is not enough.'  The fact is that even in war, two great countries like Germany and  America must and do maintain direct contact.\"    I pushed the button for Arthurjean. \"Miss Briggs,\" I asked, \"have we  any brandy in the office?\"    Dead-pan and nonchalant, she crossed the room to a small safe,  disguised as a Victorian low-boy, twiddled the dials and revealed a  neat little Frigidaire. She prepared two brandies and soda, handed  them to us and returned to her office.    \"Prosit!\" said I.    \"Heil Roosevelt!\" Roscommon answered.    \"But what did you want to see me about?\" I inquired. \"_You_ may be all  right but _I'm_ already under investigation by the F.B.I.\"    \"Nonsense, old boy, nonsense,\" he reassured me. \"If they, get  troublesome, let me know--I'm in the phone book and my girl will always  know where to reach me, day or night--and I'll tell Washington to stop  proceedings. No, Tompkins, what I wanted to tell you was that--when  you report back to your superior and I'll lay ten-to-one he's that  ass Ribbentrop--just tell him that the war's lost. Our game now is  to salvage resources for the next war, which will be against Russia,  unless I miss my guess. We've got to use these last few weeks and  days to rush funds, patents, papers, brains and organization out of  the Reich. Send them to Sweden, to Switzerland, to Italy. Fly them to  Spain, slip them in U-boats to Buenos Aires or Dublin. Tell Ribbentrop  that New York understands our problem and will play the game right  across the board, but there must be no shilly-shallying, no nonsense  about 'last stands.' If Hitler wants a Siegfried finish, let him have  it, but from now on our job is to save Germany as an asset for her  Western Allies and as a people whom the world will need to fight the  Soviets. Tell him that, will you, old man? Thanks most awfully.\"    Roscommon finished his drink with an expert swirl of the glass, smiled,  shook hands and left the room as abruptly as he had arrived in it. I  picked up the outside phone.    \"Get me F.B.I. Headquarters,\" I said. \"I wish to speak to Mr. A. J.  Harcourt. Thanks, I'll wait.\"          CHAPTER 10      \"Well, there it is, Harcourt,\" I ended my recitation. \"Miss Briggs  believes me, my wife doesn't, and I don't expect you to. But if you're  interested, I can prove I'm Frank Jacklin any number of ways.\"    The G-Man finished his drink and stared absent-mindedly at the ceiling,  while Arthurjean poured him a new shot of Bourbon and water--his fifth.    \"Mr. Tompkins,\" he said at last. \"I'm drinking your liquor in your  house--or Miss Briggs' apartment, whichever it is--and it's not for me  to call you a liar.\"    \"Don't you dare!\" Arthurjean warned him. \"Not while I'm around, G-Man  or no G-Man. Say, what do the initials A. J. stand for in your name?  Abba Jabba?\"    \"What do you think? Andrew Jackson, of course. No, Mr. Tompkins, I  won't call you a liar because, to tell the truth, I'm not sure that you  are. Lots of funny things have happened in this war. This might have  happened. But I can't do anything about it.\"    \"Can't you at least check on the Jacklin angle?\" I asked.    Harcourt shook his head. \"Before I could do any checking, I'd have to  report my reasons to the chief. If I was asked for a reason, I'd have  to explain that I had grounds for thinking that Commander Jacklin's  soul--and the F.B.I. has never established a policy on souls--had been  blown from the Aleutians clear into Westchester County and is now  running round in the body of Winfred S. Tompkins, stock broker. That  report from me would go from my chief right up to J. Edgar Hoover, the  Attorney-General, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Cabinet and President  Roosevelt. Now, wouldn't that look nice on my record? Wouldn't that  just put me right in line for promotion? Be reasonable, you two. I'm  not saying I don't believe this yarn, but it would be worth my job to  act like I believed it--and I got a wife and three kids in Brooklyn, no  fooling.\"    Arthurjean remained silent for a few minutes, \"Andrew Jackson  Harcourt--\" she began.    \"You haven't said anything about this sinister guy Roscommon,\" I  interrupted. \"You could do something about him without worrying about  me and my story.\"    \"Roscommon?\" Harcourt shrugged his shoulders. \"Going after him would  remind me of the time we hit the Governor of North Carolina with a  Great Smoky barbecued bear. Roscommon is all he says he is and orders  are out not to touch him. How do you think we ought to fight this war,  anyhow? Blind-fold?\"    \"What about that Great Smoky bear?\" Arthurjean demanded irrelevantly.  \"You-all from the South, honey-chile?\"    \"The Old North State, sugar! And you?\"    \"Tennessee, thank God! And the name's Arthurjean, Andy, and for the  millionth time I'll explain that my dad's name was Arthur and my  mother's name was Jean, so they ran 'em together, like Johns-Manville  or Pierce-Arrow, but it's all one word. No hyphen. So, there!\"    I urged them to get over their rebel yell and come back to the subject  of the bear.    \"Well, Mr. Tompkins,\" Harcourt explained. \"It's this way. Up in the  Smokies we have a special way of cooking bear. All you need is a bear,  a bee-tree, a two-handed saw and a stick of dynamite. First, you kill  your bear. That's mighty important. You skin him and you gut him and  truss him up like a chicken. Then you ram him up as far as you can deep  inside a bee-tree, just below the honey, and wedge him in so he won't  slip. Then you start a slow fire underneath him inside the tree. The  fire sort of slow-cooks the bear, like a Dutch oven, drives off the  bees and melts the honey-comb. The honey just naturally drips down on  the bear meat while she's cooking. Just about the time the tree's ready  to fall--course, "]]]
