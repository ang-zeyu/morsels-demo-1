And still we  contemplate with pleasure the partnership in literature and affection  between the Howitts,--the congenial pursuits and productions--the  pedestrian tours wherein the married pair showed that marriage, on a  wide enough basis, does not destroy the \"inexhaustible\" entertainment  which lovers find in one another's company.    In naming these instances, I do not mean to imply that community of  employment is essential to the union of husband and wife, more than to  the union of friends. Harmony exists in difference, no less than in  likeness, if only the same key-note govern both parts. Woman the poem,  Man the poet! Woman the heart, Man the head! Such divisions are only  important when they are never to be transcended. If nature is never  bound down, nor the voice of inspiration stifled, that is enough. We  are pleased that women should write and speak, if they feel need of  it, from having something to tell; but silence for ages would be no  misfortune, if that silence be from divine command, and not from Man's  tradition.    While Goetz Von Berlichingen rides to battle, his wife is busy in the  kitchen; but difference of occupation does not prevent that community  of inward life, that perfect esteem, with which he says,      \"Whom God loves, to him gives he such a wife.\"      Manzoni thus dedicates his \"Adelchi.\"    \"To his beloved and venerated wife, Enrichetta Luigia Blondel, who,  with conjugal affection and maternal wisdom, has preserved a virgin  mind, the author dedicates this 'Adelchi,' grieving that he could not,  by a more splendid and more durable monument, honor the dear name, and  the memory of so many virtues.\"    The relation could not be fairer, nor more equal, if she, too, had  written poems. Yet the position of the parties might have been the  reverse as well; the Woman might have sung the deeds, given voice to  the life of the Man, and beauty would have been the result; as we see,  in pictures of Arcadia, the nymph singing to the shepherds, or the  shepherd, with his pipe, alluring the nymphs; either makes a good  picture. The sounding lyre requires not muscular strength, but energy  of soul to animate the hand which would control it. Nature seems to  delight in varying the arrangements, as if to show that she will be  fettered by no rule; and we must admit the same varieties that she  admits.    The fourth and highest grade of marriage union is the religious, which  may be expressed as pilgrimage toward a common shrine. This includes  the others: home sympathies and household wisdom, for these pilgrims  must know how to assist each other along the dusty way; intellectual  communion, for how sad it would be on such a journey to have a  companion to whom you could not communicate your thoughts and  aspirations as they sprang to life; who would have no feeling for the  prospects that open, more and more glorious as we advance; who would  never see the flowers that may be gathered by the most industrious  traveller! It must include all these.    Such a fellow-pilgrim Count Zinzendorf seems to have found in his  countess, of whom he thus writes:    \"Twenty-five years' experience has shown me that just the help-meet  whom I have is the only one that could suit my vocation. Who else  could have so carried through my family affairs? Who lived so  spotlessly before the world? Who so wisely aided me in my rejection of  a dry morality? Who so clearly set aside the Pharisaism which, as  years passed, threatened to creep in among us? Who so deeply discerned  as to the spirits of delusion which sought to bewilder us? Who would  have governed my whole economy so wisely, richly and hospitably, when  circumstances commanded? Who have taken indifferently the part of  servant or mistress, without, on the one side, affecting an especial  spirituality; on the other, being sullied by any worldly pride? Who,  in a community where all ranks are eager to be on a level, would, from  wise and real causes, have known how to maintain inward and outward  distinctions? Who, without a murmur, have seen her husband encounter  such dangers by land and sea? Who undertaken with him, and  _sustained_, such astonishing pilgrimages? Who, amid such  difficulties, would have always held up her head and supported me? Who  found such vast sums of money, and acquitted them on her own credit?  And, finally, who, of all human beings, could so well understand and  interpret to others my inner and outer being as this one, of such  nobleness in her way of thinking, such great intellectual capacity,  and so free from the theological perplexities that enveloped me!\"    Let any one peruse, with all intentness, the lineaments of this  portrait, and see if the husband had not reason, with this air of  solemn rapture and conviction, to challenge comparison? We are  reminded of the majestic cadence of the line whose feet stop in the  just proportion of Humanity,      \"Daughter of God and Mati, accomplished Eve!\"      An observer [Footnote: Spangenberg] adds this testimony:    \"We may, in many marriages, regard it as the best arrangement, if the  man has so much advantage over his wife, that she can, without much  thought of her own, be led and directed by him as by a father. But it  was not so with the count and his consort. She was not made to be a  copy; she was an original; and, while she loved and honored him, she  thought for herself, on all subjects, with so much intelligence, that  he could and did look on her as a sister and friend also.\"    Compare with this refined specimen of a religiously civilized life the  following imperfect sketch of a North American Indian, and we shall  see that the same causes will always produce the same results, The  Flying Pigeon (Ratchewaine) was the wife of a barbarous chief, who had  six others; but she was his only true wife, because the only one of a  strong and pure character, and, having this, inspired a veneration, as  like as the mind of the man permitted to that inspired by the Countess  Zinzendorf. She died when her son was only four years old, yet left on  his mind a feeling of reverent love worthy the thought of Christian  chivalry. Grown to manhood, he shed tears on seeing her portrait.      THE FLYING PIGEON.    \"Ratchewaine was chaste, mild, gentle in her disposition, kind,  generous, and devoted to her husband. A harsh word was never known to  proceed from her mouth; nor was she ever known to be in a passion.  Mabaskah used to say of her, after her death, that her hand was shut  when those who did not want came into her presence; but when the  really poor came in, it was like a strainer full of holes, letting all  she held in it pass through. In the exercise of generous feeling she  was uniform, It was not indebted for its exercise to whim, nor  caprice, nor partiality. No matter of what nation the applicant for  her bounty was, or whether at war or peace with her nation; if he were  hungry, she fed him; if naked, she clothed him; and, if houseless, she  gave him shelter. The continued exercise of this generous feeling kept  her poor. And she has been known to give away her last blanket--all  the honey that was in the lodge, the last bladder of bear's oil, and  the last piece of dried meat.    \"She was scrupulously exact in the observance of all the religious  rites which her faith imposed upon her. Her conscience is represented  to have been extremely tender. She often feared that her acts were  displeasing to the Great Spirit, when she would blacken her face, and  retire to some lone place, and fast and pray.\"    To these traits should be added, but for want of room, anecdotes which  show the quick decision and vivacity of her mind. Her face was in  harmony with this combination. Her brow is as ideal and the eyes and  lids as devout and modest as the Italian picture of the Madonna, while  the lower part of the face has the simplicity and childish strength of  the Indian race. Her picture presents the finest specimen of Indian  beauty we have ever seen. Such a Woman is the sister and friend of all  beings, as the worthy Man is their brother and helper.    With like pleasure we survey the pairs wedded on the eve of missionary  effort They, indeed, are fellow-pilgrims on the well-made road, and  whether or no they accomplish all they hope for the sad Hindoo, or the  nearer savage, we feel that in the burning waste their love is like to  be a healing dew, in the forlorn jungle a tent of solace to one  another. They meet, as children of one Father, to read together one  book of instruction.    We must insert in this connection the most beautiful picture presented  by ancient literature of wedded love under this noble form.    It is from the romance in which Xenophon, the chivalrous Greek,  presents his ideal of what human nature should be.    The generals of Cyrus had taken captive a princess, a woman of  unequalled beauty, and hastened to present her to the prince as that  part of the spoil he would think most worthy of his acceptance. Cyrus  visits the lady, and is filled with immediate admiration by the  modesty and majesty with which she receives him. He finds her name is  Panthea, and that she is the wife of Abradatus, a young king whom she  entirely loves. He protects her as a sister, in his camp, till he can  restore her to her husband.    After the first transports of joy at this reunion, the heart of  Panthea is bent on showing her love and gratitude to her magnanimous  and delicate protector. And as she has nothing so precious to give as  the aid of Abradatus, that is what she most wishes to offer. Her  husband is of one soul with her in this, as in all things.    The description of her grief and self-destruction, after the death  which ensued upon this devotion, I have seen quoted, but never that of  their parting when she sends him forth to battle. I shall copy both.

Only one  tune is played, and that tune never varies. I don't know its real name,  but the White Hussars call it, \"Take me to London again.\" It sounds very  pretty. The Regiment would sooner be struck off the roster than forego  their distinction.    After the \"dismiss\" was sounded, the officers rode off home to prepare for  stables; and the men filed into the lines riding easy. That is to say,  they opened their tight buttons, shifted their helmets, and began to joke  or to swear as the humor took them; the more careful slipping off and  easing girths and curbs. A good trooper values his mount exactly as much  as he values himself, and believes, or should believe, that the two  together are irresistible where women or men, girls or guns, are  concerned.    Then the Orderly-Officer gave the order, \"Water horses,\" and the Regiment  loafed off to the squadron-troughs which were in rear of the stables and  between these and the barracks. There were four huge troughs, one for each  squadron, arranged _en échelon_, so that the whole Regiment could water in  ten minutes if it liked. But it lingered for seventeen, as a rule, while  the Band played.    The Band struck up as the squadrons filed off to the troughs, and the men  slipped their feet out of the stirrups and chaffed each other. The sun was  just setting in a big, hot bed of red cloud, and the road to the Civil  Lines seemed to run straight into the sun's eye. There was a little dot on  the road. It grew and grew till it showed as a horse, with a sort of  gridiron-thing on his back. The red cloud glared through the bars of the  gridiron. Some of the troopers shaded their eyes with their hands and  said--\"What the mischief 'as that there 'orse got on 'im?\"    In another minute they heard a neigh that every soul--horse and man--in  the Regiment knew, and saw, heading straight toward the Band, the dead  Drum-Horse of the White Hussars!    On his withers banged and bumped the kettledrums draped in crape, and on  his back, very stiff and soldierly, sat a bareheaded skeleton.    The Band stopped playing, and, for a moment, there was a hush.    Then some one in E Troop--men said it was the Troop-Sergeant-Major--swung  his horse round and yelled. No one can account exactly for what happened  afterward; but it seems that, at least, one man in each troop set an  example of panic, and the rest followed like sheep. The horses that had  barely put their muzzles into the troughs reared and capered; but as soon  as the Band broke, which it did when the ghost of the Drum-Horse was about  a furlong distant, all hooves followed suit, and the clatter of the  stampede--quite different from the orderly throb and roar of a movement on  parade, or the rough horse-play of watering in camp--made them only more  terrified. They felt that the men on their backs were afraid of something.  When horses once know that, all is over except the butchery.    Troop after troop turned from the troughs and ran--anywhere and  everywhere--like spilled quicksilver. It was a most extraordinary  spectacle, for men and horses were in all stages of easiness, and the  carbine-buckets flopping against their sides urged the horses on. Men were  shouting and cursing, and trying to pull clear of the Band which was being  chased by the Drum-Horse whose rider had fallen forward and seemed to be  spurring for a wager.    The Colonel had gone over to the Mess for a drink. Most of the officers  were with him, and the Subaltern of the Day was preparing to go down to  the lines, and receive the watering reports from the Troop-Sergeant-  Majors. When \"Take me to London again\" stopped, after twenty bars, every  one in the Mess said, \"What on earth has happened?\" A minute later, they  heard unmilitary noises, and saw, far across the plain, the White Hussars  scattered, and broken, and flying.    The Colonel was speechless with rage, for he thought that the Regiment had  risen against him or was unanimously drunk. The Band, a disorganized mob,  tore past, and at its heels labored the Drum-Horse--the dead and buried  Drum-Horse--with the jolting, clattering skeleton, Hogan-Yale whispered  softly to Martyn--\"No wire will stand that treatment,\" and the Band, which  had doubled like a hare, came back again. But the rest of the Regiment was  gone, was rioting all over the Province, for the dusk had shut in and each  man was howling to his neighbor that the Drum-Horse was on his flank.  Troop-horses are far too tenderly treated as a rule. They can, on  emergencies, do a great deal, even with seventeen stone on their backs. As  the troopers found out.    How long this panic lasted I cannot say. I believe that when the moon rose  the men saw they had nothing to fear, and, by twos and threes and  half-troops, crept back into Cantonments very much ashamed of themselves.  Meantime, the Drum-Horse, disgusted at his treatment by old friends,  pulled up, wheeled round, and trotted up to the Mess veranda-steps for  bread. No one liked to run; but no one cared to go forward till the  Colonel made a movement and laid hold of the skeleton's foot. The Band had  halted some distance away, and now came back slowly. The Colonel called  it, individually and collectively, every evil name that occurred to him at  the time; for he had set his hand on the bosom of the Drum-Horse and found  flesh and blood. Then he beat the kettle-drums with his clenched fist, and  discovered that they were but made of silvered paper and bamboo. Next,  still swearing, he tried to drag the skeleton out of the saddle, but found  that it had been wired into the cantle. The sight of the Colonel, with his  arms round the skeleton's pelvis and his knee in the old Drum-Horse's  stomach, was striking. Not to say amusing. He worried the thing off in a  minute or two, and threw it down on the ground, saying to the Band--\"Here,  you curs, that's what you're afraid of.\" The skeleton did not look pretty  in the twilight The Band-Sergeant seemed to recognize it, for he began to  chuckle and choke. \"Shall I take it away, sir?\" said the Band-Sergeant.  \"Yes,\" said the Colonel, \"take it to Hell, and ride there yourselves!\"    The Band-Sergeant saluted, hoisted the skeleton across his saddle-bow, and  led off to the stables. Then the Colonel began to make inquiries for the  rest of the Regiment, and the language he used was wonderful, He would  disband the Regiment--he would court-martial every soul in it--he would  not command such a set of rabble, and so on, and so on. As the men dropped  in, his language grew wilder, until at last it exceeded the utmost limits  of free speech allowed even to a Colonel of Horse.    Martyn took Hogan-Yale aside and suggested compulsory retirement from the  Service as a necessity when all was discovered. Martyn was the weaker man  of the two. Hogan-Yale put up his eyebrows and remarked, firstly, that he  was the son of a Lord, and, secondly, that he was as innocent as the babe  unborn of the theatrical resurrection of the Drum-Horse.    \"My instructions,\" said Yale, with a singularly sweet smile, \"were that  the Drum-Horse should be sent back as impressively as possible. I ask you,  _am_ I responsible if a mule-headed friend sends him back in such a manner  as to disturb the peace of mind of a regiment of Her Majesty's Cavalry?\"    Martyn said, \"You are a great man, and will in time become a General; but  I'd give my chance of a troop to be safe out of this affair.\"    Providence saved Martyn and Hogan-Yale. The Second-in-Command led the  Colonel away to the little curtained alcove wherein the Subalterns of the  White Hussars were accustomed to play poker of nights; and there, after  many oaths on the Colonel's part, they talked together in low tones. I  fancy that the Second-in-Command must have represented the scare as the  work of some trooper whom it would be hopeless to detect; and I know that  he dwelt upon the sin and the shame of making a public laughing-stock of  the scare.    \"They will call us,\" said the Second-in-Command, who had really a fine  imagination--\"they will call us the 'Fly-by-Nights'; they will call us the  'Ghost Hunters'; they will nickname us from one end of the Army List to  the other. All the explanation in the world won't make outsiders  understand that the officers were away when the panic began. For the honor  of the Regiment and for your own sake keep this thing quiet.\"    The Colonel was so exhausted with anger that soothing him down was not so  difficult as might be imagined. He was made to see, gently and by degrees,  that it was obviously impossible to court-martial the whole Regiment and  equally impossible to proceed against any subaltern who, in his belief,  had any concern in the hoax.    \"But the beast's alive! He's never been shot at all!\" shouted the Colonel.  \"It's flat flagrant disobedience! I've known a man broke for less--dam  sight less. They're mocking me, I tell you, Mutman! They're mocking me!\"    Once more, the Second-in-Command set himself to soothe the Colonel, and  wrestled with him for half an hour. At the end of that time, the  Regimental Sergeant-Major reported himself. The situation was rather novel  to him; but he was not a man to be put out by circumstances. He saluted  and said, \"Regiment all comeback, Sir.\" Then, to propitiate the  Colonel--\"An' none of the 'orses any the worse, Sir,\"    The Colonel only snorted and answered--\"You'd better tuck the men into  their cots, then, and see that they don't wake up and cry in the night\"  The Sergeant withdrew.    His little stroke of humor pleased the Colonel, and, further, he felt  slightly ashamed of the language he had been using. The Second-in-Command  worried him again, and the two sat talking far into the night.    Next day but one, there was a Commanding Officer's parade, and the Colonel  harangued the White Hussars vigorously. The pith of"]]]
