After various incoherences  had taken their turn to occupy my fancy, I at length imagined myself  walking, in the evening twilight, to my brother's habitation. A pit,  methought, had been dug in the path I had taken, of which I was not  aware. As I carelessly pursued my walk, I thought I saw my brother,  standing at some distance before me, beckoning and calling me to make  haste. He stood on the opposite edge of the gulph. I mended my pace, and  one step more would have plunged me into this abyss, had not some  one from behind caught suddenly my arm, and exclaimed, in a voice of  eagerness and terror, \"Hold! hold!\"    The sound broke my sleep, and I found myself, at the next moment,  standing on my feet, and surrounded by the deepest darkness. Images  so terrific and forcible disabled me, for a time, from distinguishing  between sleep and wakefulness, and withheld from me the knowledge of my  actual condition. My first panics were succeeded by the perturbations of  surprize, to find myself alone in the open air, and immersed in so deep  a gloom. I slowly recollected the incidents of the afternoon, and how  I came hither. I could not estimate the time, but saw the propriety of  returning with speed to the house. My faculties were still too confused,  and the darkness too intense, to allow me immediately to find my way up  the steep. I sat down, therefore, to recover myself, and to reflect upon  my situation.    This was no sooner done, than a low voice was heard from behind the  lattice, on the side where I sat. Between the rock and the lattice was a  chasm not wide enough to admit a human body; yet, in this chasm he that  spoke appeared to be stationed. \"Attend! attend! but be not terrified.\"    I started and exclaimed, \"Good heavens! what is that? Who are you?\"    \"A friend; one come, not to injure, but to save you; fear nothing.\"    This voice was immediately recognized to be the same with one of  those which I had heard in the closet; it was the voice of him who had  proposed to shoot, rather than to strangle, his victim. My terror made  me, at once, mute and motionless. He continued, \"I leagued to murder  you. I repent. Mark my bidding, and be safe. Avoid this spot. The snares  of death encompass it. Elsewhere danger will be distant; but this spot,  shun it as you value your life. Mark me further; profit by this warning,  but divulge it not. If a syllable of what has passed escape you, your  doom is sealed. Remember your father, and be faithful.\"    Here the accents ceased, and left me overwhelmed with dismay. I was  fraught with the persuasion, that during every moment I remained here,  my life was endangered; but I could not take a step without hazard of  falling to the bottom of the precipice. The path, leading to the summit,  was short, but rugged and intricate. Even star-light was excluded by the  umbrage, and not the faintest gleam was afforded to guide my steps. What  should I do? To depart or remain was equally and eminently perilous.    In this state of uncertainty, I perceived a ray flit across the gloom  and disappear. Another succeeded, which was stronger, and remained for  a passing moment. It glittered on the shrubs that were scattered at the  entrance, and gleam continued to succeed gleam for a few seconds, till  they, finally, gave place to unintermitted darkness.    The first visitings of this light called up a train of horrors in my  mind; destruction impended over this spot; the voice which I had lately  heard had warned me to retire, and had menaced me with the fate of my  father if I refused. I was desirous, but unable, to obey; these gleams  were such as preluded the stroke by which he fell; the hour, perhaps,  was the same--I shuddered as if I had beheld, suspended over me, the  exterminating sword.    Presently a new and stronger illumination burst through the lattice  on the right hand, and a voice, from the edge of the precipice above,  called out my name. It was Pleyel. Joyfully did I recognize his accents;  but such was the tumult of my thoughts that I had not power to answer  him till he had frequently repeated his summons. I hurried, at length,  from the fatal spot, and, directed by the lanthorn which he bore,  ascended the hill.    Pale and breathless, it was with difficulty I could support myself. He  anxiously inquired into the cause of my affright, and the motive of my  unusual absence. He had returned from my brother's at a late hour, and  was informed by Judith, that I had walked out before sun-set, and had  not yet returned. This intelligence was somewhat alarming. He waited  some time; but, my absence continuing, he had set out in search of me.  He had explored the neighbourhood with the utmost care, but, receiving  no tidings of me, he was preparing to acquaint my brother with this  circumstance, when he recollected the summer-house on the bank, and  conceived it possible that some accident had detained me there. He again  inquired into the cause of this detention, and of that confusion and  dismay which my looks testified.    I told him that I had strolled hither in the afternoon, that sleep had  overtaken me as I sat, and that I had awakened a few minutes before  his arrival. I could tell him no more. In the present impetuosity of my  thoughts, I was almost dubious, whether the pit, into which my brother  had endeavoured to entice me, and the voice that talked through the  lattice, were not parts of the same dream. I remembered, likewise, the  charge of secrecy, and the penalty denounced, if I should rashly divulge  what I had heard. For these reasons, I was silent on that subject, and  shutting myself in my chamber, delivered myself up to contemplation.    What I have related will, no doubt, appear to you a fable. You will  believe that calamity has subverted my reason, and that I am amusing  you with the chimeras of my brain, instead of facts that have really  happened. I shall not be surprized or offended, if these be your  suspicions. I know not, indeed, how you can deny them admission. For, if  to me, the immediate witness, they were fertile of perplexity and doubt,  how must they affect another to whom they are recommended only by  my testimony? It was only by subsequent events, that I was fully and  incontestibly assured of the veracity of my senses.    Meanwhile what was I to think? I had been assured that a design had been  formed against my life. The ruffians had leagued to murder me. Whom had  I offended? Who was there with whom I had ever maintained intercourse,  who was capable of harbouring such atrocious purposes?    My temper was the reverse of cruel and imperious. My heart was touched  with sympathy for the children of misfortune. But this sympathy was not  a barren sentiment. My purse, scanty as it was, was ever open, and my  hands ever active, to relieve distress. Many were the wretches whom  my personal exertions had extricated from want and disease, and who  rewarded me with their gratitude. There was no face which lowered at my  approach, and no lips which uttered imprecations in my hearing. On the  contrary, there was none, over whose fate I had exerted any influence,  or to whom I was known by reputation, who did not greet me with smiles,  and dismiss me with proofs of veneration; yet did not my senses assure  me that a plot was laid against my life?    I am not destitute of courage. I have shewn myself deliberative and calm  in the midst of peril. I have hazarded my own life, for the preservation  of another, but now was I confused and panic struck. I have not lived  so as to fear death, yet to perish by an unseen and secret stroke, to be  mangled by the knife of an assassin was a thought at which I shuddered;  what had I done to deserve to be made the victim of malignant passions?    But soft! was I not assured, that my life was safe in all places but  one? And why was the treason limited to take effect in this spot? I  was every where equally defenceless. My house and chamber were, at all  times, accessible. Danger still impended over me; the bloody purpose was  still entertained, but the hand that was to execute it, was powerless in  all places but one!    Here I had remained for the last four or five hours, without the means  of resistance or defence, yet I had not been attacked. A human being was  at hand, who was conscious of my presence, and warned me hereafter to  avoid this retreat. His voice was not absolutely new, but had I never  heard it but once before? But why did he prohibit me from relating  this incident to others, and what species of death will be awarded if I  disobey?    He talked of my father. He intimated, that disclosure would pull upon my  head, the same destruction. Was then the death of my father, portentous  and inexplicable as it was, the consequence of human machinations? It  should seem, that this being is apprised of the true nature of this  event, and is conscious of the means that led to it. Whether it shall  likewise fall upon me, depends upon the observance of silence. Was it  the infraction of a similar command, that brought so horrible a penalty  upon my father?    Such were the reflections that haunted me during the night, and which  effectually deprived me of sleep. Next morning, at breakfast, Pleyel  related an event which my disappearance had hindered him from mentioning  the night before. Early the preceding morning, his occasions called him  to the city; he had stepped into a coffee-house to while away an hour;  here he had met a person whose appearance instantly bespoke him to be  the same whose hasty visit I have mentioned, and whose extraordinary  visage and tones had so powerfully affected me. On an attentive survey,  however, he proved, likewise, to be one with whom my friend had had some  intercourse in Europe. This authorised the liberty of accosting him, and  after some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7937"],[0,"Journal of an African Cruiser (#13)"],[1,"es. But this must have been done  secretly, or the law would have taken hold of them. Slavers, no doubt,  have often watered at Monrovia, but never when their character was known.  On the other hand, the slave stations at St. Paul's river, at Bassa, and  at Junk, have undeniably been broken up by the presence of the colonists.  Even if destitute of sympathy for fellow-men of their own race and hue,  and regardless of their deep stake in the preservation of their character,  the evident fact is, that self-interest would prompt the inhabitants of  Liberia to oppose the slave-trade in their vicinity. Wherever the slaver  comes, he purchases large quantities of rice at extravagant rates, thus  curtailing the supply to the colonist, and enhancing the price. Moreover,  the natives, always preferring the excitement of war to the labors of  peace, neglect the culture of the earth, and have no camwood nor palm-oil  to offer to the honest trader, who consequently finds neither buyers nor  sellers among them.    The truth is, the slave-traders can dispense with assistance from the  Liberian colonists. They procure goods, and everything necessary to their  trade, at Sierra Leone, or from any English or American vessel on the  coast. If the merchantmen find a good market for their cargoes, they are  satisfied, whatever be the character of their customers. This is well  understood and openly avowed here. The English have no right to taunt the  Americans, nor to claim higher integrity on their own part. They lend  precisely the same indirect aid to the traffic that the Americans do, and  furnish everything except vessels, which likewise they would supply, if  they could build them. It is the policy of the English ship-masters on the  coast to represent the Americans as engaged in the slave-trade; for if, by  such accusations, they can induce British or American men-of-war to detain  and examine the fair trader, they thus rid themselves of troublesome  rivals.    The natives are generally favorable to the slave-trade. It brings them  many comforts and luxuries, which the legitimate trade does not supply.  Their argument is, that \"if a man goes into the Bush and buys camwood, he  must pay another to bring it to the beach. But if he buy a slave, this  latter commodity will not only walk, but bring a load of camwood on his  back.\" All slaves exported are Bushmen, many of whom are brought from two  or three hundred miles in the interior. The Fishmen and Kroomen are the  agents between the slave-traders and the interior tribes. They will not  permit the latter to become acquainted with the white men, lest their own  agency and its profits should cease. A slave, once sold, seldom returns to  his home.    If transported to a foreign country, his case is of course hopeless; and  even if recaptured on the coast, his return is almost impossible. His  home, probably, is far distant from the sea. It can only be reached by  traversing the territories of four or five nations, any one of whom would  seize the hapless stranger, and either consign him to slavery among  themselves, or send him again to a market on the coast. Hence, those  recaptured by the English cruisers are either settled at Sierra Leone, or  transported to some other of the colonies of Great Britain.    The price paid to the native agents for a full grown male slave, is about  one musket, twelve pieces of romauls, one cutlass, a demijohn of rum, a  bar of iron, a keg of powder, and ten bars of leaf-tobacco, the whole  amounting to the value of thirty to thirty-five dollars. A female is sold  for about a quarter less; and boys of twelve or thirteen command only a  musket and two pieces of romauls. Slave-vessels go from Havana with  nothing but dollars and doubloons. Other vessels go out with the above  species of goods, and all others requisite for the trade. The slaver buys  the goods on the coast, pays for them with specie, and lands them in  payment for the slaves, money being but little used in traffic with the  natives.    13.--The Decatur arrived this evening, after a passage of thirty days from  Porto Praya. She left the Macedonian on the way, the winds being light,  the current adverse, and the frigate sailing very badly.    17.--The Macedonian arrived.    Coming off from town, to-day, I took a canoe with a couple of Kroomen, who  paddled down the river, till we arrived at a narrow part of the  promontory. On touching the shallows, one of the Kroomen took me on his  back to the dry land. The two then picked up the canoe, carried her across  the cape, perhaps a hundred yards, and launched her, with myself on board,  through the heavy surf.    21.--Sailed at daylight for Sinoe, leaving the Macedonian and Decatur, an  American ship and barque, an English brig, and two Hamburg vessels, at  anchor.    25.--Anchored at Sinoe at noon.    26.--Ashore. Visited Fishtown, a well-built native village, containing  probably four hundred inhabitants. It is within about two hundred yards of  the colonial dwellings. The people are said to have committed many  depredations upon the colonists; and there is an evident intention of  driving them off. This is the tribe with which we are to hold a palaver.    There are two grand divisions of native Africans on the Western Coast, the  Fishmen and the Bushmen; the latter being inhabitants of the interior; and  the former comprising all the tribes along the sea-shore, who gain a  subsistence by fishing, trading between the Bushmen and foreign vessels,  and laboring on shipboard. The Kroomen, so often mentioned, are in some  respects a distinct and separate people; although a large proportion,  probably nine-tenths of those bearing that name, are identical with the  Fishmen. The latter are generally treacherous and deceitful; the Kroomen  are much more honest, but still are not to be trusted without reserve and  discrimination.    The government of these people, and of the natives generally, is nominally  monarchical, but democratic in substance. The regal office appears to be  hereditary in a family, but not to descend according to our ideas of  lineal succession. The power of the king is greatly circumscribed by the  privilege, which every individual in the tribe possesses, of calling a  palaver. If a man deems himself injured, he demands a full discussion of  his rights or wrongs, in presence of the rulers and the tribe. The  head-men sit in judgment, and substantial justice is generally done. There  are persons, celebrated for their power and copiousness of talking, who  appear as counsel in behalf of the respective parties. The more  distinguished of these advocates are sometimes sent for, from a distance  of two or three hundred miles, to speak at a palaver; and, in such cases,  they leave all other employment, and hurry to the scene of action.    It would appear that, on other parts of the coast, or farther in the  interior, the native kings possess more power and assume greater state,  than those who have come under my notice. The King of Appollonia,  adjoining Axim Territory, is said to be very rich and powerful. If the  report of his nearest civilized neighbor, the Governor of Axim, is to be  credited, this potentate's house is furnished most sumptuously in the  European style. Gold cups, pitchers, and plates, are used at his table,  with furniture of corresponding magnificence in all the departments of his  household. He possesses vast treasures in bullion and gold dust. The  Governor of Dixcove informed me, that, about four years ago, he  accompanied an English expedition against Appollonia, which is still  claimed by England, although their fort there has been abandoned. On their  approach, the King fled, and left them masters of the place. Some of the  English soldiers opened the sepulchre of the King last deceased, and took  away an unknown amount of gold. Afterwards, by order of the Governor, the  remainder was taken from the grave, amounting to several hundred dollars.  Together with the treasure, numerous articles had been buried, such as a  knife, plate, and cup, swords, guns, cloth, goods of various kinds, and,  in short, every thing that the dead King had required while alive. There  were also four skeletons, two of each sex, buried beneath the royal  coffin. It is said that sixty victims were sacrificed on occasion of the  funeral, of whom only the most distinguished were allowed, even in death,  to approach their master so nearly, and act as his immediate attendants in  the world of spirits. The splendor of an African funeral, on the Gold  Coast, is unparalleled. It is customary for persons of wealth to smear the  corpses of their friends with oil, and then to powder them with gold-dust  from head to foot, so as to produce the appearance of bronzed or golden  statues.    The present King of Appollonia deposited six hundred ounces of gold (about  ten thousand dollars) with the Governor of Cape Coast Castle, as security  for his good behavior. His cellar is well supplied with rare wines, which  he offers liberally to strangers who land at his residence. All these  circumstances, and this barbaric magnificence, indicate a far different  condition from that of the native Kings in the vicinity of Liberia, who  live simply, like their subjects, on vegetables and fish, and one of whom  was proud to array himself in a cast-off garment of my own. Their wealth  consists not in gold, plate, or bullion, but in crockery and earthenware.  Not only the Kings, but all the rich natives, accumulate articles of this  kind, until their dwellings resemble warehouses of crockery. Perhaps fifty  white wash-bowls, with as many pitchers, mugs, and plates, may be seen  around the room; and when these utensils become so numerous as to excite  the envy of the tribe, the owners are said to bury them in the earth. In  the house of King Glass (so named, I presume, from the transparency of his  character), I noticed the first indications of a taste"]]]
