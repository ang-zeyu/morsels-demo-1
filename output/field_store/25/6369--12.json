You can't mean  'twas?\"    \"Oh, my dear, don't 'e ask me.\"    \"I can't 'ardly believe,\" said the wife miserably, \"that 'e'd do such a  thing.  'E's always been a good-livin' feller, 'e don't drink and 'e  never seemed to be after the maidens.  Can't think,\" she said,  surrendering the point as proven, \"whatever ail the man.\"    The fact that Leadville was capable of using violence to gain his ends  had sunk into Mrs. Tom's mind.  She was like an old hen when a hawk is  in the blue.  \"I don't want to keep Gray 'ome,\" she said uneasily, \"but  if Leadville worry the life out of 'er...\"    Mrs. Byron had rallied from her consternation.  At the bottom of her  heart she preserved a little doubt. The story was perhaps substantially  true, true enough to show in which direction the wind was blowing; but  Gray, being a timid maid, the tale had not lost in the telling.    \"'Tis a pack o' tommy-rot,\" she said at last, anger beginning to colour  her unhappy amazement, \"a man of his years runnin' after young maidens;  but once Gray's married 'e won't think no more about it.  'Tis  disgraceful of him; and, what's more, 'tis madness for'm to think she's  goin' to 'av anything to do wi' an old man like 'e.  Isolda, I do think  'tis time Gray was married.\"    \"Iss, my dear, so do I.\"    \"Well--why don't they?\"    \"It mean a good bit o' money to get married, you know,\" said Mrs. Tom  who, in spite of her alert mind, was not capable of quick decisions,  \"and one thing more, marrying isn't horse-jocking.\"    \"Why don't they put the banns in and get married on the quiet?\"    The other went off on a side issue.  \"You know,\" she said, uttering her  thoughts aloud, \"Leadville's bound to know one day.\"    \"If Gray was to walk in one morning and say 'I'm married,'\" continued  Mrs. Byron, \"what could 'e do then?  'E'd 'av to 'old 'is tongue.\"    The thought of Gray doing anything so bold brought a smile to the  mother's lips.  \"I'm sure she wouldn't do that, S'bina.\"    \"Well, p'raps she wouldn't.\"  Mrs. Byron had realized that her friend,  in revealing the incident of the lane, had meant to convey a warning.  The aunt did not wish to have Gray replaced by the handsome more noisy  Richbell and yet...  \"I feel I belong to speak to Leadville about it,\"  she said reluctantly.  \"But I don't want for'n to think I'm always  watchin' 'im.\"  The little doubt as to his having been as guilty as  Isolda would have her think, had grown.  She could not believe his  jumping out of the hedge had been more than a trick, a practical joke.  Gray, in her alarm, must have magnified it.  These inexperienced girls  were as easily frightened as a sheep!  A way out of the difficulty  occurred to her.  \"My dear, 'ow would it be if Leonora was to come and  stay for a few days?\"    Mrs. Tom thought that Sabina was only postponing the reckoning which in  the long run she would be bound to make, but aloud she gave consent.    \"Well, Leonora can come for a bit and see 'ow they get on, but she'd 'av  to sleep 'ome.  She'd better come down early in the mornin', for 'tis  breakfast-time, when you'm in bed, that Leadville torment Gray.\"    \"Every month,\" said Sabina hopefully, \"I feel I shall soon be able to  get up early in the mornin's; by spring, I'm sure I shall be able to.\"    \"I hope by that time, please God,\" said Mrs. Tom, getting up to go, \"the  maid will be married.\"    She felt it would be as well for Gray to have the protection of a man,  in love with her and constantly at her side and, as she went uphill  between the November hedges, she considered what she should tell her  husband. Tom was a peaceable and cautious man, but his blood was hot.  The wife wondered whether he would be willing for Gray to be married  quietly?  A good deal depended on the girl.  Since the time, as a little  child, that she had fallen into the pail of boiling pig's meal and they  had nearly lost her, she had been her father's pet.  If he understood  that she was unhappy and that Leadville was the cause, he would be  certain to make himself unpleasant.  Mrs. Tom did not wish to stir up  strife.    Leonora, when told she was to spend her days at Auntie Sabina's, shook  back her curls and declared herself delighted.  One of a big household  she knew the stint of comparatively narrow means and a change would be  welcome.  Before Gray was out of her aunt's room the following morning,  impatient fingers were rattling at the handle of the porch; and  Leadville, stealing down as usual in his stockinged feet, heard with  surprise a sound of voices in the kitchen.  He stared when Leonora came  from the linhay carrying hog's pudding and a frying-pan.    \"I've come to breakfast,\" she said, smiling up at him with bright and  friendly eyes, \"and I be comin' every morning.  I like comin' 'ere.  Aunt S'bina says I shall be company for Gray and I dearly love 'og's  puddin', Uncle Leadville, don't you?\"    Leadville's tortured spirit was in the gaze he turned from the busy  child to her sister.  Was he to lose the hour with Gray which had been  the solace of lonely night and empty day, the one hour out of the  twenty-four that was his?  He did not answer Leonora but looked his  anxious question.  Was Gray at the bottom of this?  But no, she could  not be.  It was a scheme of Sabina's, of Mrs. Tom's, or simple accident.    Drawing Old Squire's big elbow-chair up to the table he took his  customary seat.  Leonora chattered of school, of the little pigs that  had had to be killed because they had worms, such dear little pigs, all  black; and Gray served the breakfast.  Leadville, sitting opposite to  her, drank in her morning freshness and looked forward to the time when  this flower should be blooming for him.    A voice called from the Justice Room and Leonora jumped up.  \"I'll see  what auntie wants.\"    \"No, dear, I'll go.\"    \"Leave 'er go,\" rumbled Leadville in his compelling bass and she was off  on the wings of happy service.  He stared resentfully after the flying  figure.  \"What's she doin' 'ere?\"    Gray's heart was aflutter.  \"I miss the children so.\"    His eyes grew tender.  \"You do want a nest of your own, my bird.  I can  see you in it, a li'l place away from 'ere.\"    She shook her head, repudiating the idea with courage born of her  sister's nearness.  \"I don't want never to leave Trevorrick and mammy,  and any of them.\"    \"You'd 'av so much of your own things to think about,\" he murmured, his  mind full of the nest he would build for her, \"you wouldn't 'av time to  think upon 'ome.\"    Before she could answer, Leonora was back.  \"'Tis you auntie want,  Gray.\"    Suspicion flamed in Leadville's eye.  \"If they're schemin' to come  between us,\" he said angrily, \"they'd better look out.  Don't you go,  Gray.\"    But the girl, running on light feet down the long dark passage, was glad  to escape.  When Uncle Leadville looked at her like that, she had ever a  fluttered feeling that she must run away, or something, she knew not  what, but something terrible, would happen.  Instinct was warning her,  instinct that is wiser even than experience and Leadville might sit on  in the kitchen, waiting and waiting, but until he was gone, Gray would  not return.                                       *CHAPTER VII*      The year ran mildly down to Christmas, but the wind with its tang of  cold did not fling a rose into Gray's cheek or buffet her into keener  life and, when again the friends met in council, it was to discuss  changes which both saw to be necessary.    \"Jim's taking the cart into Stowe, week before Christmas,\" said Mrs.  Byron when they had talked the matter over, \"to bring 'ome some coals  and flour.  P'raps that day'll suit Gray?\"    \"Well, I'll talk to 'er and see what she got to say.\"    \"Very well then, Friday before Christmas.\"    \"And you'll 'av Richbell till you see 'ow things turn out?\"    \"Iss.  She growin' to a fine maid.  They'm all pretty but Richbell's got  the best colour.  'Tis lovely an' I don't wonder the boys is maaeze  about 'er.  Still,\" she sighed, \"give me Gray.\"    \"We all know Gray's the favourite here,\" smiled Mrs. Tom, sticking her  needles into the stocking she was knitting and looking round for her  cloak.  \"Well, I think we'm doing the best we can, seein' Leadville's so  teasy.\"    \"He'll settle down right enough now.  'Tedn't as if 'e was a young man.  When 'e do realize 'e's out of the running, 'e'll take it quiet and  we'll be all comfortable again.\"    \"Well, my dear, I hope we shall.  It 'as been a draggin' time for 'ee  since you was laid up.\"    \"'Tis funny,\" said Sabina, \"'ow you think 'Now that's over and done  with,' but 'tedn't.  I thought 'Once I'm out of 'ospital I'll soon put  things to rights,' but I 'aven't done it yet.\"    \"Takes time, my dear.\"    \"Iss, and time's life.\"    Leadville had become so remote and unapproachable that Sabina did not  find an opportunity to tell him the wagon would be going into Stowe the  Friday before Christmas and that Gray would be taking fowls, cream and  butter, to the market.  Not even when the day dawned did he realize that  anything unusual was afoot.  He had come down to breakfast, stared with  sullen aversion at Leonora, as the cheerful child ran to and fro between  kitchen and linhay; and sought in his uninventive mind for expedients  which should leave him alone with her sister for a blessed few minutes.  He did this morning after morning, sometimes successfully; but  generally, as Gray wished to keep the child near her, without its making  much difference.  On this particular day Leonora, chattering of  Christmas festivities, the tree they were to have at the chapel on New  Year's Eve, the tea the following day, was eventually seen off to school  and Gray, turning a deaf ear to Leadville's plea that she would linger,  went candle in hand, for the sun was still below the eastern hill, to  Sabina's room.  Her mind was brimful of the practicalities of the day in  Stowe.  She had no time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#13)"],[1,"of the Mutiny, and had somehow hung on to the position of Civil  Surgeon ever since--he had been years and years at Rassih; the  Government was only too glad to leave him there, regardless of the  feelings of the rest of the station. Why, they were practically natives!  And it was believed they smoked hookahs--certainly their house smelt  like it. Pussy, the daughter (no chicken), had been doing her best to  marry young Smithson, the Taylors' assistant; but she, Mrs. Piggott,  had warned the young man, with the result that just as the Antonios were  expecting him to propose every moment, he had fled into camp. If only  the Antonios could know! They would never speak to her again.    \"And no great loss,\" added Mrs. Piggott, \"except that in such a small  station it's a pity to have rows. Then there are the Fosters (railway  people); they are inclined to give themselves airs because they have a  little money of their own, which is unusual in India. But you will see  them all for yourself, my dear. Of course, you will come to the Club? We  all play tennis there every evening, and have tea and pegs, and look at  the English papers.\"    \"I suppose so,\" said Stella doubtfully; \"but my husband hasn't said  anything about it.\"    \"You must cure him of his dull habits. Hitherto he has only had some of  the men to play tennis with him on his own courts, which, of course, are  first-rate, but it's rather unsociable of him. He must not expect _you_  to hold yourself aloof from the rest of us. Now if he won't bring you  himself to the Club just let me know, and I can always pick you up on my  way.\"    Mrs. Piggott saw herself envied by the station as young Mrs. Crayfield's  bosom friend. She took the first opportunity of telling Mrs. Cuthell,  whom she detested, that Mrs. Crayfield had been perfectly sweet to _her_  when she called, had asked her advice on all kinds of points, and had  taken her into her bedroom to show her the trousseau and the jewellery,  etc.--all of which, by the way, was untrue; but Mrs. Piggott considered  the falsehoods worth while, since it annoyed Mrs. Cuthell and made her  jealous.    Stella thought she would like to belong to the Club; but, to her  surprise, when Robert came to the drawing-room for tea, and she  mentioned the subject, he said he did not wish her to \"make herself  cheap\"; he disapproved of the Club gatherings--a lot of gossiping women  and silly young men. Once a week--whichever day she liked to select--she  could be \"At Home\" to the whole station. Their own tennis courts were in  excellent order, and there was no occasion to become intimate with  anyone.    \"You will return their calls, of course,\" he continued, \"and we must  give a couple of dinner parties, and there will be your weekly  reception. That will be quite enough. Now go and get on your habit and  we'll have a ride.\"    Stella obeyed, feeling rather crestfallen. The programme sounded dull.  Was she never to make any friends? And what was Robert's objection to  all these people? Surely she and Robert were not so superior themselves  as to warrant such splendid isolation! However, for the moment she made  no protest; the recollection of her husband's violence on the night of  their arrival was still with her; she feared to provoke him. But there  would seem to be drawbacks to the position of \"chief lady of the  station,\" according to Robert's idea of its fulfilment!    She forgot her vexation in the delight of mounting the handsome chestnut  mare that was to be her own property, and in the softening sunshine  they skirted the high wall of the city and trotted along the unmetalled  footway of the main road beneath splendid trees planted at equal  distances apart. They passed a few compounds with thatched bungalows  standing well back from the dusty road; these dwellings looked humble in  comparison with the palace on the old fort walls that commanded the  huddled bazaar and the scattered European habitations beyond. They met  native vehicles packed with passengers; and riders of miserable ponies  dismounted, making obeisance, as the Commissioner Sahib went by; low  narrow carts, crowded with women and children and merchandise, creaked  along lazily in the middle of the road.    Then they turned from this main thoroughfare and galloped along a broad,  grass-grown canal bank, flanked on one side with luxuriant plantations;  on the other, dull green water flowed steadily, silently, bearing life  to the villages and crops below. Crossing a bridge, they rode to a  village where Colonel Crayfield wished to make some inquiries connected  with his administration; and Stella watched, keenly interested, while  the headman, a patriarch with a long, henna-dyed beard, hurried forth to  make his report, followed by a rabble of peasants who gathered at a  respectful distance to gape at the spectacle of an Englishwoman on  horseback. Now and then a naked child would run boldly into the open,  only to be hauled back shrieking by relations whose reproaches were as  piercing as the culprit's lamentations.    The memsahib gazed at it all, absorbed; she was sorry when her husband  raised his whip to his hat in farewell salutation to the headman, and  they turned their backs on the village and the eager, excited little  crowd. Their return was by a different route, which, to Stella's secret  interest, took them past the Club gardens. Tennis was in progress, and  the spectators were seated in chairs collected around a refreshment  table. Every head was turned in the direction of the riders; the Club  members seemed as eager to behold the lady on horseback as had been the  villagers. It was pleasing to Stella to find herself the object of so  much human curiosity.          CHAPTER VII      It was the day of Mrs. Crayfield's first garden party. What struck  Stella as an extraordinary form of invitation had gone forth by hand: a  notice, with \"Mrs. Crayfield at Home,\" and the chosen date, inscribed in  large copper-plate by a clerk in the Commissioner's office. Below was  written, \"Please write seen,\" and then came a column of names, the whole  of the visitable community of Rassih. This document came back duly  initialled by all but one or two inaccessible bachelors who were out in  the district on duty. Stella expressed a nervous hope that everyone  would come, and inquired what preparations she ought to make.    \"Trust them to come!\" scoffed Robert. \"And don't worry yourself about  preparations. The servants know what to do.\"    And, indeed, the servants' capabilities seemed miraculous. Tennis nets  were fixed, the courts marked out correctly; tables became covered with  cakes and sandwiches, tea and coffee, spirits and liqueurs, multitudes  of soda-water bottles; there was fresh lemonade and claret-cup. All far  more imposing than even the yearly flower-show at the vicarage at home  that was patronised by the whole county! Stella felt there ought to be a  band in attendance as well. She dressed herself in a soft white gown,  and a lace hat that had cost Santa-Sahib a fabulous sum in London; then  she stood for a few moments on the raised plinth overlooking the garden  to watch Sher Singh giving orders and directions on the tennis ground  below. Nothing had been forgotten; the row of cane chairs had little  strips of carpet in front of them, and a group of small native boys  clothed in white, with red caps and red belts, stood ready till they  should be wanted to retrieve the balls. And all this was to happen every  week!    Santa-Sahib came out and stood beside her, bulky, cheerful, in clean  flannels, smoking a long cheroot.    \"Turn round, little girl,\" he commanded; \"let's have a look at you.\"    She turned and bobbed him a curtsey; he regarded her from head to foot  with a proprietary air of satisfaction, yet he was silent, and Stella  inquired anxiously if she \"would do.\"    \"Just as well, perhaps, that we're not in a big station,\" he exclaimed,  half laughing, half serious, \"or it would take me all my time to look  after you!\"    \"But shall we be here always?\" she asked.    \"The longer the better,\" he answered shortly. \"And no careering off to  the hills, mind, unless of course----\"    \"Unless what? Do tell me!\"    \"Unless your health makes it necessary.\"    \"My health? But I'm as strong as a horse. What do you mean?\"    \"What I say, my good child. Thank goodness you _are_ a fine healthy  young woman, and that old Antonio's strong point is maternity cases!\"    The blood flew to her face, and down again to her toes; such a  possibility, at which she now understood he was hinting, had never  presented itself to her mind. She felt horrified, frightened, as though  caught in a trap. Did Robert expect it of her? How cruel of him to talk  like this just when she was so content and lighthearted, looking forward  to her garden party, to everything in the future. A baby! She knew  nothing about children, and if she did have a child it would, she felt  sure, be exactly like Santa-Sahib--plain, and solid, and red. Why on  earth couldn't one be married without all that sort of thing!    She heard Robert say: \"Why, what's the matter?\" and she looked up to  find his small, hard eyes fixed on her with a quizzical expression that  disturbed her still further.    \"Nothing,\" she replied uneasily, turning from him to hide her distress.  \"Look, there's somebody arriving. Hadn't we better go down?\"    \"It's Beard, the missionary, and his wife, and I'm hanged if they  haven't brought their family with them!\"    An odd little party was scrambling from an antiquated pony carriage. Mr.  Beard, in a long black coat, white trousers, and a pith hat shaped like  a half of a football; Mrs. Beard, in a voluminous gown of some green  material; and three little girls, who all wore sun-hats as well--hats so  large that they appeared to rest on the children's shoulders.    Stella hastened down the steps in front of her husband, to greet the  guests who were now"]]]
