[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],[0,"The Woman in White (#13)"],[1,"-road seem young?\" she  asked.  \"Young enough to be two- or three-and-twenty?\"    \"Yes, Miss Halcombe, as young as that.\"    \"And she was strangely dressed, from head to foot, all in white?\"    \"All in white.\"    While the answer was passing my lips Miss Fairlie glided into view on  the terrace for the third time.  Instead of proceeding on her walk, she  stopped, with her back turned towards us, and, leaning on the  balustrade of the terrace, looked down into the garden beyond.  My eyes  fixed upon the white gleam of her muslin gown and head-dress in the  moonlight, and a sensation, for which I can find no name--a sensation  that quickened my pulse, and raised a fluttering at my heart--began to  steal over me.    \"All in white?\" Miss Halcombe repeated.  \"The most important sentences  in the letter, Mr. Hartright, are those at the end, which I will read  to you immediately.  But I can't help dwelling a little upon the  coincidence of the white costume of the woman you met, and the white  frocks which produced that strange answer from my mother's little  scholar.  The doctor may have been wrong when he discovered the child's  defects of intellect, and predicted that she would 'grow out of them.'  She may never have grown out of them, and the old grateful fancy about  dressing in white, which was a serious feeling to the girl, may be a  serious feeling to the woman still.\"    I said a few words in answer--I hardly know what.  All my attention was  concentrated on the white gleam of Miss Fairlie's muslin dress.    \"Listen to the last sentences of the letter,\" said Miss Halcombe. \"I  think they will surprise you.\"    As she raised the letter to the light of the candle, Miss Fairlie  turned from the balustrade, looked doubtfully up and down the terrace,  advanced a step towards the glass doors, and then stopped, facing us.    Meanwhile Miss Halcombe read me the last sentences to which she had  referred--      \"'And now, my love, seeing that I am at the end of my paper, now for  the real reason, the surprising reason, for my fondness for little Anne  Catherick.  My dear Philip, although she is not half so pretty, she is,  nevertheless, by one of those extraordinary caprices of accidental  resemblance which one sometimes sees, the living likeness, in her hair,  her complexion, the colour of her eyes, and the shape of her face----'\"      I started up from the ottoman before Miss Halcombe could pronounce the  next words.  A thrill of the same feeling which ran through me when the  touch was laid upon my shoulder on the lonely high-road chilled me  again.    There stood Miss Fairlie, a white figure, alone in the moonlight; in  her attitude, in the turn of her head, in her complexion, in the shape  of her face, the living image, at that distance and under those  circumstances, of the woman in white! The doubt which had troubled my  mind for hours and hours past flashed into conviction in an instant.  That \"something wanting\" was my own recognition of the ominous likeness  between the fugitive from the asylum and my pupil at Limmeridge House.    \"You see it!\" said Miss Halcombe.  She dropped the useless letter, and  her eyes flashed as they met mine.  \"You see it now, as my mother saw  it eleven years since!\"    \"I see it--more unwillingly than I can say.  To associate that forlorn,  friendless, lost woman, even by an accidental likeness only, with Miss  Fairlie, seems like casting a shadow on the future of the bright  creature who stands looking at us now.  Let me lose the impression  again as soon as possible.  Call her in, out of the dreary  moonlight--pray call her in!\"    \"Mr. Hartright, you surprise me.  Whatever women may be, I thought that  men, in the nineteenth century, were above superstition.\"    \"Pray call her in!\"    \"Hush, hush! She is coming of her own accord.  Say nothing in her  presence.  Let this discovery of the likeness be kept a secret between  you and me.  Come in, Laura, come in, and wake Mrs. Vesey with the  piano.  Mr. Hartright is petitioning for some more music, and he wants  it, this time, of the lightest and liveliest kind.\"        IX    So ended my eventful first day at Limmeridge House.    Miss Halcombe and I kept our secret.  After the discovery of the  likeness no fresh light seemed destined to break over the mystery of  the woman in white.  At the first safe opportunity Miss Halcombe  cautiously led her half-sister to speak of their mother, of old times,  and of Anne Catherick.  Miss Fairlie's recollections of the little  scholar at Limmeridge were, however, only of the most vague and general  kind.  She remembered the likeness between herself and her mother's  favourite pupil, as something which had been supposed to exist in past  times; but she did not refer to the gift of the white dresses, or to  the singular form of words in which the child had artlessly expressed  her gratitude for them. She remembered that Anne had remained at  Limmeridge for a few months only, and had then left it to go back to  her home in Hampshire; but she could not say whether the mother and  daughter had ever returned, or had ever been heard of afterwards.  No  further search, on Miss Halcombe's part, through the few letters of  Mrs. Fairlie's writing which she had left unread, assisted in clearing  up the uncertainties still left to perplex us.  We had identified the  unhappy woman whom I had met in the night-time with Anne Catherick--we  had made some advance, at least, towards connecting the probably  defective condition of the poor creature's intellect with the  peculiarity of her being dressed all in white, and with the  continuance, in her maturer years, of her childish gratitude towards  Mrs. Fairlie--and there, so far as we knew at that time, our  discoveries had ended.      The days passed on, the weeks passed on, and the track of the golden  autumn wound its bright way visibly through the green summer of the  trees.  Peaceful, fast-flowing, happy time! my story glides by you now  as swiftly as you once glided by me.  Of all the treasures of enjoyment  that you poured so freely into my heart, how much is left me that has  purpose and value enough to be written on this page? Nothing but the  saddest of all confessions that a man can make--the confession of his  own folly.    The secret which that confession discloses should be told with little  effort, for it has indirectly escaped me already.  The poor weak words,  which have failed to describe Miss Fairlie, have succeeded in betraying  the sensations she awakened in me.  It is so with us all.  Our words  are giants when they do us an injury, and dwarfs when they do us a  service.    I loved her.    Ah! how well I know all the sadness and all the mockery that is  contained in those three words.  I can sigh over my mournful confession  with the tenderest woman who reads it and pities me.  I can laugh at it  as bitterly as the hardest man who tosses it from him in contempt.  I  loved her! Feel for me, or despise me, I confess it with the same  immovable resolution to own the truth.    Was there no excuse for me? There was some excuse to be found, surely,  in the conditions under which my term of hired service was passed at  Limmeridge House.    My morning hours succeeded each other calmly in the quiet and seclusion  of my own room.  I had just work enough to do, in mounting my  employer's drawings, to keep my hands and eyes pleasurably employed,  while my mind was left free to enjoy the dangerous luxury of its own  unbridled thoughts.  A perilous solitude, for it lasted long enough to  enervate, not long enough to fortify me.  A perilous solitude, for it  was followed by afternoons and evenings spent, day after day and week  after week alone in the society of two women, one of whom possessed all  the accomplishments of grace, wit, and high-breeding, the other all the  charms of beauty, gentleness, and simple truth, that can purify and  subdue the heart of man.  Not a day passed, in that dangerous intimacy  of teacher and pupil, in which my hand was not close to Miss Fairlie's;  my cheek, as we bent together over her sketch-book, almost touching  hers.  The more attentively she watched every movement of my brush, the  more closely I was breathing the perfume of her hair, and the warm  fragrance of her breath.  It was part of my service to live in the very  light of her eyes--at one time to be bending over her, so close to her  bosom as to tremble at the thought of touching it; at another, to feel  her bending over me, bending so close to see what I was about, that her  voice sank low when she spoke to me, and her ribbons brushed my cheek  in the wind before she could draw them back.    The evenings which followed the sketching excursions of the afternoon  varied, rather than checked, these innocent, these inevitable  familiarities.  My natural fondness for the music which she played with  such tender feeling, such delicate womanly taste, and her natural  enjoyment of giving me back, by the practice of her art, the pleasure  which I had offered to her by the practice of mine, only wove another  tie which drew us closer and closer to one another.  The accidents of  conversation; the simple habits which regulated even such a little  thing as the position of our places at table; the play of Miss  Halcombe's ever-ready raillery, always directed against my anxiety as  teacher, while it sparkled over her enthusiasm as pupil; the harmless  expression of poor Mrs. Vesey's drowsy approval, which connected Miss  Fairlie and me as two model young people who never disturbed her--every  one of these trifles, and many more, combined to fold us together in  the same domestic atmosphere, and to lead us both insensibly to the  same hopeless end.    I should have remembered my position, and have put myself secretly on  my guard.  I did so, but not till it was too late.  All the discretion,  all the experience, which had availed me with other women, and secured  me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/584"],[0,"Our Nig; Or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, in a Two-story White House, (#13)"],[1," had known him well during her  long sojourn in the family; and his praise of her nice butter and  cheese, from which his table was supplied, she knew he felt as well as  spoke.    \"You're sick, very sick,\" he said, quickly, after a moment's pause.  \"Take good care of her, Abby, or she'll never get well. All broken  down.\"    \"Yes, it was at Mrs. Moore's,\" said Mrs. B., \"all this was done. She did  but little the latter part of the time she was here.\"    \"It was commenced longer ago than last summer. Take good care of her;  she may never get well,\" remarked the Dr.    \"We sha'n't pay you for doctoring her; you may look to the town for  that, sir,\" said Mrs. B., and abruptly left the room.    \"Oh dear! oh dear!\" exclaimed Frado, and buried her face in the pillow.    A few kind words of consolation, and she was once more alone in the  darkness which enveloped her previous days. Yet she felt sure they owed  her a shelter and attention, when disabled, and she resolved to feel  patient, and remain till she could help herself. Mrs. B. would not  attend her, nor permit her domestic to stay with her at all. Aunt Abby  was her sole comforter. Aunt Abby's nursing had the desired effect, and  she slowly improved. As soon as she was able to be moved, the kind Mrs.  Moore took her to her home again, and completed what Aunt Abby had so  well commenced. Not that she was well, or ever would be; but she had  recovered so far as rendered it hopeful she might provide for her own  wants. The clergyman at whose house she was taken sick, was now seeking  some one to watch his sick children, and as soon as he heard of her  recovery, again asked for her services.    What seemed so light and easy to others, was too much for Frado; and it  became necessary to ask once more where the sick should find an asylum.    All felt that the place where her declining health began, should be the  place of relief; so they applied once more for a shelter.    \"No,\" exclaimed the indignant Mrs. B., \"she shall never come under this  roof again; never! never!\" she repeated, as if each repetition were a  bolt to prevent admission.    One only resource; the public must pay the expense. So she was removed  to the home of two maidens, (old,) who had principle enough to be  willing to earn the money a charitable public disburses.    Three years of weary sickness wasted her, without extinguishing a life  apparently so feeble. Two years had these maidens watched and cared for  her, and they began to weary, and finally to request the authorities to  remove her.    Mrs. Hoggs was a lover of gold and silver, and she asked the favor of  filling her coffers by caring for the sick. The removal caused severe  sickness.    By being bolstered in the bed, after a time she could use her hands, and  often would ask for sewing to beguile the tedium. She had become very  expert with her needle the first year of her release from Mrs. B., and  she had forgotten none of her skill. Mrs. H. praised her, and as she  improved in health, was anxious to employ her. She told her she could in  this way replace her clothes, and as her board would be paid for, she  would thus gain something.    Many times her hands wrought when her body was in pain; but the hope  that she might yet help herself, impelled her on.    Thus she reckoned her store of means by a few dollars, and was hoping  soon to come in possession, when she was startled by the announcement  that Mrs. Hoggs had reported her to the physician and town officers as  an impostor. That she was, in truth, able to get up and go to work.    This brought on a severe sickness of two weeks, when Mrs. Moore again  sought her, and took her to her home. She had formerly had wealth at her  command, but misfortune had deprived her of it, and unlocked her heart  to sympathies and favors she had never known while it lasted. Her  husband, defrauded of his last means by a branch of the Bellmont family,  had supported them by manual labor, gone to the West, and left his wife  and four young children. But she felt humanity required her to give a  shelter to one she knew to be worthy of a hospitable reception. Mrs.  Moore's physician was called, and pronounced her a very sick girl, and  encouraged Mrs. M. to keep her and care for her, and he would see that  the authorities were informed of Frado's helplessness, and pledged  assistance.    Here she remained till sufficiently restored to sew again. Then came the  old resolution to take care of herself, to cast off the unpleasant  charities of the public.    She learned that in some towns in Massachusetts, girls make straw  bonnets--that it was easy and profitable. But how should SHE, black,  feeble and poor, find any one to teach her. But God prepares the way,  when human agencies see no path. Here was found a plain, poor, simple  woman, who could see merit beneath a dark skin; and when the invalid  mulatto told her sorrows, she opened her door and her heart, and took  the stranger in. Expert with the needle, Frado soon equalled her  instructress; and she sought also to teach her the value of useful  books; and while one read aloud to the other of deeds historic and names  renowned, Frado experienced a new impulse. She felt herself capable of  elevation; she felt that this book information supplied an undefined  dissatisfaction she had long felt, but could not express. Every leisure  moment was carefully applied to self-improvement, and a devout and  Christian exterior invited confidence from the villagers. Thus she  passed months of quiet, growing in the confidence of her neighbors and  new found friends.          CHAPTER XII.    THE WINDING UP OF THE MATTER.        Nothing new under the sun.        SOLOMON.        A FEW years ago, within the compass of my narrative, there appeared  often in some of our New England villages, professed fugitives from  slavery, who recounted their personal experience in homely phrase, and  awakened the indignation of non-slaveholders against brother Pro. Such a  one appeared in the new home of Frado; and as people of color were rare  there, was it strange she should attract her dark brother; that he  should inquire her out; succeed in seeing her; feel a strange sensation  in his heart towards her; that he should toy with her shining curls,  feel proud to provoke her to smile and expose the ivory concealed by  thin, ruby lips; that her sparkling eyes should fascinate; that he  should propose; that they should marry? A short acquaintance was indeed  an objection, but she saw him often, and thought she knew him. He never  spoke of his enslavement to her when alone, but she felt that, like her  own oppression, it was painful to disturb oftener than was needful.    He was a fine, straight negro, whose back showed no marks of the lash,  erect as if it never crouched beneath a burden. There was a silent  sympathy which Frado felt attracted her, and she opened her heart to the  presence of love--that arbitrary and inexorable tyrant.    She removed to Singleton, her former residence, and there was married.  Here were Frado's first feelings of trust and repose on human arm. She  realized, for the first time, the relief of looking to another for  comfortable support. Occasionally he would leave her to \"lecture.\"    Those tours were prolonged often to weeks. Of course he had little spare  money. Frado was again feeling her self-dependence, and was at last  compelled to resort alone to that. Samuel was kind to her when at home,  but made no provision for his absence, which was at last unprecedented.    He left her to her fate--embarked at sea, with the disclosure that he  had never seen the South, and that his illiterate harangues were humbugs  for hungry abolitionists. Once more alone! Yet not alone. A still newer  companionship would soon force itself upon her. No one wanted her with  such prospects. Herself was burden enough; who would have an additional  one?    The horrors of her condition nearly prostrated her, and she was again  thrown upon the public for sustenance. Then followed the birth of her  child. The long absent Samuel unexpectedly returned, and rescued her  from charity. Recovering from her expected illness, she once more  commenced toil for herself and child, in a room obtained of a poor  woman, but with better fortune. One so well known would not be wholly  neglected. Kind friends watched her when Samuel was from home, prevented  her from suffering, and when the cold weather pinched the warmly clad, a  kind friend took them in, and thus preserved them. At last Samuel's  business became very engrossing, and after long desertion, news reached  his family that he had become a victim of yellow fever, in New Orleans.    So much toil as was necessary to sustain Frado, was more than she could  endure. As soon as her babe could be nourished without his mother, she  left him in charge of a Mrs. Capon, and procured an agency, hoping to  recruit her health, and gain an easier livelihood for herself and child.  This afforded her better maintenance than she had yet found. She passed  into the various towns of the State she lived in, then into  Massachusetts. Strange were some of her adventures. Watched by  kidnappers, maltreated by professed abolitionists, who didn't want  slaves at the South, nor niggers in their own houses, North. Faugh! to  lodge one; to eat with one; to admit one through the front door; to sit  next one; awful!    Traps slyly laid by the vicious to ensnare her, she resolutely avoided.  In one of her tours, Providence favored her with a friend who, pitying  her cheerless lot, kindly provided her with a valuable recipe, from  which she might herself manufacture a useful article for her  maintenance. This proved a more agreeable, and an easier way of  sustenance.    And thus, to the present time, may you see her busily employed in  preparing her merchandise; then sallying forth to encounter many frowns,  but some kind friends and purchasers. Nothing"]]]
