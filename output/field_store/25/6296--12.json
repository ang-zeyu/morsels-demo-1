The dramatic club was the pride of Tillie's heart, and her enthusiasm  was the principal factor in keeping it together. Sick or well, Tillie  always attended rehearsals, and was always urging the young people, who  took rehearsals lightly, to \"stop fooling and begin now.\" The young  men--bank clerks, grocery clerks, insurance agents--played tricks,  laughed at Tillie, and \"put it up on each other\" about seeing her home;  but they often went to tiresome rehearsals just to oblige her. They were  good-natured young fellows. Their trainer and stage-manager was young  Upping, the jeweler who ordered Thea's music for her.    Though barely thirty, he had followed half a dozen professions, and had  once been a violinist in the orchestra of the Andrews Opera Company,  then well known in little towns throughout Colorado and Nebraska.    By one amazing indiscretion Tillie very nearly lost her hold upon the  Moonstone Drama Club. The club had decided to put on \"The Drummer Boy of  Shiloh,\" a very ambitious undertaking because of the many supers needed  and the scenic difficulties of the act which took place in Andersonville  Prison. The members of the club consulted together in Tillie's absence  as to who should play the part of the drummer boy. It must be taken by a  very young person, and village boys of that age are self-conscious and  are not apt at memorizing. The part was a long one, and clearly it must  be given to a girl. Some members of the club suggested Thea Kronborg,  others advocated Lily Fisher. Lily's partisans urged that she was much  prettier than Thea, and had a much \"sweeter disposition.\" Nobody denied  these facts. But there was nothing in the least boyish about Lily, and  she sang all songs and played all parts alike. Lily's simper was  popular, but it seemed not quite the right thing for the heroic drummer  boy.    Upping, the trainer, talked to one and another: \"Lily's all right for  girl parts,\" he insisted, \"but you've got to get a girl with some ginger  in her for this. Thea's got the voice, too. When she sings, 'Just Before  the Battle, Mother,' she'll bring down the house.\"    When all the members of the club had been privately consulted, they  announced their decision to Tillie at the first regular meeting that was  called to cast the parts. They expected Tillie to be overcome with joy,  but, on the contrary, she seemed embarrassed. \"I'm afraid Thea hasn't  got time for that,\" she said jerkily. \"She is always so busy with her  music. Guess you'll have to get somebody else.\"    The club lifted its eyebrows. Several of Lily Fisher's friends coughed.  Mr. Upping flushed. The stout woman who always played the injured wife  called Tillie's attention to the fact that this would be a fine  opportunity for her niece to show what she could do. Her tone was  condescending.    Tillie threw up her head and laughed; there was something sharp and wild  about Tillie's laugh--when it was not a giggle. \"Oh, I guess Thea hasn't  got time to do any showing off. Her time to show off ain't come yet. I  expect she'll make us all sit up when it does. No use asking her to take  the part. She'd turn her nose up at it. I guess they'd be glad to get  her in the Denver Dramatics, if they could.\"    The company broke up into groups and expressed their amazement. Of  course all Swedes were conceited, but they would never have believed  that all the conceit of all the Swedes put together would reach such a  pitch as this. They confided to each other that Tillie was \"just a  little off, on the subject of her niece,\" and agreed that it would be as  well not to excite her further. Tillie got a cold reception at  rehearsals for a long while afterward, and Thea had a crop of new  enemies without even knowing it.          X    Wunsch and old Fritz and Spanish Johnny celebrated Christmas together,  so riotously that Wunsch was unable to give Thea her lesson the next  day. In the middle of the vacation week Thea went to the Kohlers'  through a soft, beautiful snowstorm. The air was a tender blue-gray,  like the color on the doves that flew in and out of the white dove-house  on the post in the Kohlers' garden. The sand hills looked dim and  sleepy. The tamarisk hedge was full of snow, like a foam of blossoms  drifted over it. When Thea opened the gate, old Mrs. Kohler was just  coming in from the chicken yard, with five fresh eggs in her apron and a  pair of old top-boots on her feet. She called Thea to come and look at a  bantam egg, which she held up proudly. Her bantam hens were remiss in  zeal, and she was always delighted when they accomplished anything. She  took Thea into the sitting-room, very warm and smelling of food, and  brought her a plateful of little Christmas cakes, made according to old  and hallowed formulae, and put them before her while she warmed her  feet. Then she went to the door of the kitchen stairs and called: \"Herr  Wunsch, Herr Wunsch!\"    Wunsch came down wearing an old wadded jacket, with a velvet collar. The  brown silk was so worn that the wadding stuck out almost everywhere. He  avoided Thea's eyes when he came in, nodded without speaking, and  pointed directly to the piano stool. He was not so insistent upon the  scales as usual, and throughout the little sonata of Mozart's she was  studying, he remained languid and absent-minded. His eyes looked very  heavy, and he kept wiping them with one of the new silk handkerchiefs  Mrs. Kohler had given him for Christmas. When the lesson was over he did  not seem inclined to talk. Thea, loitering on the stool, reached for a  tattered book she had taken off the music-rest when she sat down. It was  a very old Leipsic edition of the piano score of Gluck's \"Orpheus.\" She  turned over the pages curiously.    \"Is it nice?\" she asked.    \"It is the most beautiful opera ever made,\" Wunsch declared solemnly.  \"You know the story, eh? How, when she die, Orpheus went down below for  his wife?\"    \"Oh, yes, I know. I didn't know there was an opera about it, though. Do  people sing this now?\"    \"ABER JA! What else? You like to try? See.\" He drew her from the stool  and sat down at the piano. Turning over the leaves to the third act, he  handed the score to Thea. \"Listen, I play it through and you get the  RHYTHMUS. EINS, ZWEI, DREI, VIER.\" He played through Orpheus' lament,  then pushed back his cuffs with awakening interest and nodded at Thea.  \"Now, VOM BLATT, MIT MIR.\"    \"ACH, ICH HABE SIE VERLOREN, ALL' MEIN GLUCK IST NUN DAHIN.\"    Wunsch sang the aria with much feeling. It was evidently one that was  very dear to him.    \"NOCH EINMAL, alone, yourself.\" He played the introductory measures,  then nodded at her vehemently, and she began:--    \"ACH, ICH HABE SIE VERLOREN.\"    When she finished, Wunsch nodded again. \"SCHON,\" he muttered as he  finished the accompaniment softly. He dropped his hands on his knees and  looked up at Thea. \"That is very fine, eh? There is no such beautiful  melody in the world. You can take the book for one week and learn  something, to pass the time. It is good to know--always. EURIDICE,  EU--RI--DI--CE, WEH DASS ICH AUF ERDEN BIN!\" he sang softly, playing the  melody with his right hand.    Thea, who was turning over the pages of the third act, stopped and  scowled at a passage. The old German's blurred eyes watched her  curiously.    \"For what do you look so, IMMER?\" puckering up his own face. \"You see  something a little difficult, may-be, and you make such a face like it  was an enemy.\"    Thea laughed, disconcerted. \"Well, difficult things are enemies, aren't  they? When you have to get them?\"    Wunsch lowered his head and threw it up as if he were butting something.  \"Not at all! By no means.\" He took the book from her and looked at it.  \"Yes, that is not so easy, there. This is an old book. They do not print  it so now any more, I think. They leave it out, may-be. Only one woman  could sing that good.\"    Thea looked at him in perplexity.    Wunsch went on. \"It is written for alto, you see. A woman sings the  part, and there was only one to sing that good in there. You understand?  Only one!\" He glanced at her quickly and lifted his red forefinger  upright before her eyes.    Thea looked at the finger as if she were hypnotized. \"Only one?\" she  asked breathlessly; her hands, hanging at her sides, were opening and  shutting rapidly.    Wunsch nodded and still held up that compelling finger. When he dropped  his hands, there was a look of satisfaction in his face.    \"Was she very great?\"    Wunsch nodded.    \"Was she beautiful?\"    \"ABER GAR NICHT! Not at all. She was ugly; big mouth, big teeth, no  figure, nothing at all,\" indicating a luxuriant bosom by sweeping his  hands over his chest. \"A pole, a post! But for the voice--ACH! She have  something in there, behind the eyes,\" tapping his temples.    Thea followed all his gesticulations intently. \"Was she German?\"    \"No, SPANISCH.\" He looked down and frowned for a moment. \"ACH, I tell  you, she look like the Frau Tellamantez, some-thing. Long face, long  chin, and ugly al-so.\"    \"Did she die a long while ago?\"    \"Die? I think not. I never hear, anyhow. I guess she is alive somewhere  in the world; Paris, may-be. But old, of course. I hear her when I was a  youth. She is too old to sing now any more.\"    \"Was she the greatest singer you ever heard?\"    Wunsch nodded gravely. \"Quite so. She was the most--\" he hunted for an  English word, lifted his hand over his head and snapped his fingers  noiselessly in the air, enunciating fiercely, \"KUNST-LER-ISCH!\" The word  seemed to glitter in his uplifted hand, his voice was so full of  emotion.    Wunsch rose from the stool and began to button his wadded jacket,  preparing to return to his half-heated room in the loft. Thea  regretfully put on her cloak and hood and set out for home.    When Wunsch looked for his score late that afternoon,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#13)"],[1,"artificer in a leathern  apron; a sinewy figure, but eloquent, in his groping hands and bandaged  face, of some sudden blight of ruin seizing prime.  And he cried out in  a great voice:--    'A boon, lord Duke, a boon!  I am one Lupo, an armourer, and thou seest  me!'    'Certes,' said the Duke.  'Art big enough.'    'O lord!' cried the shattered thing, 'let me see justice as plain with  these blinded eyes.'    'Well, on whom?'    'Lord, on him that took me sleeping, and struck me for ever from the  rolls of daylight, sith I had cursed him for the ruin of my daughter.'    Galeazzo shrugged his shoulders.    'This thine assailant--is he noble?'    'Master, as titles go.'    'Wert a fool, then, to presume.  He were like else to have made it good  to thee.  Now, an eye for--' but he checked himself in the midst of the  enormous blasphemy.    'Judge thou, my guardian angel,' he murmured meekly.    'What!' answered the boy, with a burning face, 'needs _this_ revision by  Heaven?'  And he cried terribly: 'Master armourer, summon thy  transgressor!'    For a moment the man seemed to shrink.    'Nay,' cried the Saint, 'thou need'st not.  I see the hand of God come  forth and write upon a forehead.'  His eyes sparkled, as if in actual  inspiration.  'Tassino!' he cried, in a ringing voice.    ('He heard me address him,' thought Ludovico, curious and watchful.)    At the utterance of that name, the whole nerve of the audience seemed to  leap and fall like a candle-flame. Galeazzo himself started, and his  lids lifted, and his mouth creased a moment to a little malevolent grin.  For why?  This Tassino, while too indifferent a skipjack for his  jealousy, was yet the squire amoroso, the lover _comme il faut_ to his  own correct Duchess, Madam Bona.    A minute's ticking silence was ended by the stir and pert laugh of the  challenged himself, as he left the ring of spectators and sauntered into  the arena.  It was a little showy upstart, to be sure, as ebulliently  curled and groomed as her Grace's lap-dog, and sharing, indeed, with  Messer Tinopino the whole present caprice of their mistress's spoiling.  His own base origin and inherent vulgarity, moreover, seeming to  associate him with the ducal brutishness (an assumption which Galeazzo  rather favoured than resented), confirmed in him a self-confidence which  had early come to see no bounds to its own viciousness or effrontery.    Now he cocked one arm akimbo, and stared with insufferable insolence on  the pronouncer of his name.    'Know'st me, Prophet?' bawled he.  'Not more than I thee, methinks.  Wert well coached in this same inspiration.'    'Well, indeed,' answered Bembo.  'Thou hast said it. It was God spake in  mine ear.'    Tassino laughed scornfully.  It was a study to see these young wits  opposed, the one such plated goods, the other so silver pure.    'In the name of this lying carle,' he cried, 'what spake He?'    'He said,' said Bembo quietly, '\"Let the false swearer remember  Ananias!\"'    Then in a moment he was all ruffled and combative, like a young eagle.    'Answer!' he roared.  'Didst thou this thing?'    Now, a woman-petted, cake-fed belswagger is too much of an anomaly for  the test of nerves.  Tassino, shouted at, gave an hysteric jump which  brought him to the very brink of tears.  He was really an ill-bred  little coward, made arrogant by spoiling.  He had the greatest pity and  tenderness for himself, and to any sense of his being lost would always  respond with a lump in his throat.  Now he suddenly realised his  position, alone and baited before all--no petticoat to fly to, no  sympathy to expect from a converted tyrant, none from a mob which,  habitually the butt to his viciousness, would rejoice in his  discomfiture.  Actually the little beast began to whimper.    'Darest thou!' he cried, stamping.    'Didst thou this thing?' repeated Bernardo.    'It is no business of thine.'    'Didst thou this thing?'    'An oaf's word against----'    'Didst thou this thing?'    'Lord Duke!' appealed Tassino.    'Didst thou this thing?'    The victim fairly burst into tears.    'If I say no----'    'Die, Ananias!' shouted the Duke.  His eyes gleamed maniacally.  He half  rose in his chair.  He seemed as if furious to foreclose on a denouement  his superstition had already anticipated.  Tassino fell upon his knees.    'I did it!' he screamed.    The Duke sank back, his lips twitching and grinning. Then he glanced  covertly at Bembo, and rubbed his hands together, with a motion part  gloating, part deprecatory.  The Ser Ludovico's eyes, shaded under his  palm, were very busy, to and fro.  Bembo stood like frowning marble.    'The law, Master Scrivener?' said he quietly.    The kneeling clerk murmured from a dry throat--    'Holy sir, it takes no cognisance of these accidents. The condescensions  of the great compensate them.'    The Parablist, his lips pressed together, nodded gravely twice or  thrice.    'I see,' he said; 'a condescension which ruins two lives.'    He addressed himself, with a deadly sweetness, to the Duke.    'I prithee, who standest for God's vicegerent, call up the Jew to  sentence.'    Jehoshaphat was produced, and placed beside the blubbered, resentful  young popinjay.  The Saint addressed him:--    'Wretch, thou art convicted of the crime of defacing the Duke's image;  and he at thine elbow of defacing God's image.  Shall man dare the awful  impiety to pronounce the greater guilt thine?  Yet, if it merits death  and mutilation, what for this other?'    He paused, and a stir went through the dead stillness of the hall.  Then  Bembo addressed one of the tipstaves with ineffable civility:--    'Good officer, this rogue hath sweated coins, say'st?'    'Ay, your worship,' answered the man; 'a hundred gold ducats, if a lire.  Shook 'em in a leathern bag, a' did, like so much rusted harness.'    Bembo nodded.    'They are forfeit, by the token; and he shall labour to provide other  hundred, with cost of metal and stamping.'    Jehoshaphat, secure of his limbs, shrieked derisive--    'God of Ishril!  O, yes!  O, to be sure!  I can bleed moneys!'    'Nay,' said the Saint, 'but sweat them.  Go!'    The coiner was dragged away blaspheming.  He would have preferred a  moderate dose of the rack; but the standard set by his sentence elicited  a murmur of popular approval.  From all, that is to say, but Tassino,  who saw his own fate looming big by comparison.  He rose and looked  about him desperately, as if he contemplated bolting.  The spectators  edged together.  He whinnied. Suddenly the stranger's voice swooped upon  him like a hawk:--    'Man's image shall be restored; restore thou God's.'    The little wretch screamed in a sudden access of passion:--    'I don't know what you mean!  Leave me alone. It was his own fault, I  say.  Why did he insult me?'    'Restore thou this image of God his sight,' said Bembo quietly.    'You know I cannot!'    'Thou canst not?  Then an eye for an eye, as it was spoken.  Take ye  this wicked thing, good officers, and blind him even as he blinded the  poor armourer.'    A vibrant sound went up from the spectators, and died.  Messer Ludovico  veiled his sight, and, it might be said, his laughter.  Tassino was seen  struggling and crying in the half-fearful clutch of his gaolers.    'Thou darest not!  Dogs!  Let me go, I say.  What! would ye brave  Madonna?  Lord Duke, lord Duke, help me!'    'To repentance, my poor Tassino,' cried Galeazzo, leaning lustfully  forward.  'I trow thy part on earth is closed.'    The little monster could not believe it.  This instant fall from the  heights!  He was flaccid with terror as he fell screeching on his knees.    'Mercy, good stranger!  Mercy, dear lord saint!  The terror! the  torture!  I could not suffer them and live. O, let me live, I pray  thee!--anywhere, anyhow, and I will do all; make whatever restitution  you impose.'    As he prayed and wept and grovelled, the Saint looked down with icy pity  on his abasement.    'Restitution, Tassino!' he cried, 'for that murthered vision, for that  ruined virtue?  Wouldst thou even in thine impiousness arrogate to  thyself such divine prerogatives?  Yet, in respect of that reason with  which true justice doth hedge her reprisals, the Duke's mercy shall  still allot thee an alternative.  Sith thou canst not restore his honour  or his eyes to poor Lupo, thou shalt take his shame to wife, and in her  seek to renew that image of God which thou hast defaced.  Do this, and  only doing it, know thyself spared.'    A silence of stupefaction fell upon the court.  What would Bona say to  this arbitrary disposal of her pet, made husband to a common gipsy he  had debauched? True, the sentence, by virtue of its ethical  completeness, seemed an inspiration.  But it was a disappointment too.  None doubted but that the popinjay would subscribe to the present letter  in order to evade the practice of it by and by.  Already the paltry soul  of the creature was struggling from its submersion, gasping, and  blinking wickedly to see how it could retort upon its judge and  deliverer.  It had been better to have trodden it under for once and for  good--better for the moral of the lesson, as for all who foresaw some  hope for themselves in the crushing of an insufferable petty tyranny.  Galeazzo himself frowned and bit his nails.  He would have lusted to see  heaven pluck off this vulgar burr for him.  Only his brother, sleek and  smiling, applauded the verdict. He had a far-seeing vision, had  Ludovico, and perhaps already it was alotting a more telling role to the  little aristocrat of San Zeno than had ever been played by the cockney  parvenu down in the arena.    Suddenly the Duke was on his feet, fierce and glaring.    'Answer, dog!' he roared; 'acceptest thou the condition?'    Tassino started and sobbed.    'Yes, yes.  I accept.  I will marry her.'    The Duke took a costly chain from his own neck, and hung it about the  shoulders of"]]]
