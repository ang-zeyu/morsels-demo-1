Beside the queen swam still  another of their enemies. Indeed, the sea devils had crept upon them  and surrounded them everywhere except at the front, and Trot began  to feel nervous and worried for the first time.    Cap'n Bill kept mumbling queer words under his breath, for he had a  way of talking to himself when anything \"upsot him,\" as he would  quaintly remark. Trot always knew he was disturbed or in trouble  when he began to \"growl.\"    The only way now open was straight ahead. They swam slowly, yet fast  enough to keep a safe distance from the dreadful creature behind  them.    \"I'm afraid they are driving us into a trap,\" whispered the Queen  softly. \"But whatever happens, do not lose courage, earth friends.  Clia and I are here to protect you, and our fairy powers are  sufficient to keep you from all harm.\"    \"Oh, I don't mind so very much,\" declared Trot calmly. \"It's like  the fairy adventures in storybooks, and I've often thought I'd like  that kind of adventures, 'cause the story always turns out the right  way.\"    Cap'n Bill growled something just then, but the only words Trot  could make out were, \"never lived to tell the tale.\"    \"Oh, pshaw, Cap'n,\" she said. \"We may be in danger, right enough,  an' to be honest, I don't like the looks of these sea devils at all.  But I'm sure it's no KILLING matter, for we've got the fairy circles  all around us.\"    \"Ha ha!\" laughed the monster beside her. \"WE know all about the  fairy circles, don't we, Migg?\"    \"Ho ho!\" laughed the monster on the other side. \"We do, Slibb, my  boy, and we don't think much of fairy circles, either!\"    \"They have foiled our enemies many a time,\" declared the Princess  with much dignity.    \"Ha ha!\" laughed one. \"That's why we're here now.\"    \"Ho ho!\" laughed the other. \"We've learned a trick or two, and we've  got you fast this time.\"    Then all the sea devils--those above and the one behind, and the two  on the sides--laughed all together, and their laughter was so  horrible that it made even Trot shudder.    But now the queen stopped short, and the others stopped with her.    \"I will go no farther,\" she said firmly, not caring if the monsters  overheard her. \"It is evident that these monsters are trying to  drive us into some secret place, and it is well known that they are  in league with Zog the Terrible, whom they serve because they are as  wicked as he is. We must be somewhere near the hidden castle of Zog,  so I prefer to stay here rather than be driven into some place far  more dangerous. As for the sea devils, they are powerless to injure  us in any way. Not one of those thousand arms about us can possibly  touch our bodies.\"    The only reply to this defiant speech was another burst of horrible  laughter; and now there suddenly appeared before them still another  of the monsters, which thus completely hemmed them in. Then the  creatures began interlacing their long arms--or \"feelers\"--until  they formed a perfect cage around the prisoners, not an opening  being left that was large enough for one of them to escape through.    The mermaids and the girl and sailor man kept huddled close  together, for although they might be walled in by the sea devils,  their captors could not touch them because of the protecting magic  circles.    All at once Trot exclaimed, \"Why, we must be moving!\"    This was startling news, but by watching the flow of water past them  they saw that the little girl was right. The sea devils were  swimming, all together, and as the cage they were in moved forward,  our friends were carried with it.    Queen Aquareine had a stern look upon her beautiful face. Cap'n Bill  guessed from this look that the mermaid was angry, for it seemed  much like the look Trot's mother wore when they came home late to  dinner. But however angry the queen might be, she was unable to help  herself or her guests just now or to escape from the guidance of the  dreaded sea devils. The rest of the party had become sober and  thoughtful, and in dignified silence they awaited the outcome of  this strange adventure.          CHAPTER 12    THE ENCHANTED ISLAND      All at once it grew dark around them. Neither Cap'n Bill nor Trot  liked this gloom, for it made them nervous not to be able to see  their enemies.    \"We must be near a sea cavern, if not within one,\" whispered  Princess Clia, and even as she spoke the network of scarlet arms  parted before them, leaving an avenue for them to swim out of the  cage. There was brighter water ahead, too, so the queen said without  hesitation:    \"Come along, dear friends; but let us clasp hands and keep close  together.\"    They obeyed her commands and swam swiftly out of their prison and  into the clear water before them, glad to put a distance between  themselves and the loathesome sea devils. The monsters made no  attempt to follow them, but they burst into a chorus of harsh  laughter which warned our friends that they had not yet accomplished  their escape.    The four now found themselves in a broad, rocky passage, which was  dimly lighted from some unknown source. The walls overhead, below  them and at the sides all glistened as if made of silver, and in  places were set small statues of birds, beasts and fishes, occupying  niches in the walls and seemingly made from the same glistening  material.    The queen swam more slowly now that the sea devils had been left  behind, and she looked exceedingly grave and thoughtful.    \"Have you ever been here before?\" asked Trot.    \"No, dear,\" said the Queen with a sigh.    \"And do you know where we are?\" continued the girl.    \"I can guess,\" replied Aquareine. \"There is only one place in all  the sea where such a passage as that we are in could exist without  my knowledge, and that is in the hidden dominions of Zog. If we are  indeed in the power of that fearful magician, we must summon all our  courage to resist him, or we are lost!\"    \"Is Zog more powerful than the mermaids?\" asked Trot anxiously.    \"I do not know, for we have never before met to measure our  strength,\" answered Aquareine. \"But if King Anko could defeat the  magician, as he surely did, then I think I shall be able to do so.\"    \"I wish I was sure of it,\" muttered Cap'n Bill.    Absolute silence reigned in the silver passage. No fish were there;  not even a sea flower grew to relieve the stern grandeur of this  vast corridor. Trot began to be impressed with the fact that she was  a good way from her home and mother, and she wondered if she would  ever get back again to the white cottage on the cliff. Here she was,  at the bottom of the great ocean, swimming through a big tunnel that  had an enchanted castle at the end, and a group of horrible sea  devils at the other! In spite of this thought, she was not very much  afraid. Although two fairy mermaids were her companions, she relied,  strange to say, more upon her tried and true friend, Cap'n Bill,  than upon her newer acquaintances to see her safely out of her  present trouble.    Cap'n Bill himself did not feel very confident.    \"I don't care two cents what becomes o' me,\" he told Princess Clia  in a low voice, \"but I'm drea'ful worried over our Trot. She's too  sweet an' young to be made an end of in this 'ere fashion.\"    Clia smiled at this speech. \"I'm sure you will find the little  girl's end a good way off,\" she replied. \"Trust to our powerful  queen, and be sure she will find some means for us all to escape  uninjured.\"    The light grew brighter as they advanced, until finally they  perceived a magnificent archway just ahead of them. Aquareine  hesitated a moment whether to go on or turn back, but there was no  escaping the sea devils behind them, and she decided the best way  out of their difficulties was to bravely face the unknown Zog and  rely upon her fairy powers to prevent his doing any mischief to  herself or her friends. So she led the way, and together they  approached the archway and passed through it.    They now found themselves in a vast cavern, so great in extent that  the dome overhead looked like the sky when seen from earth. In the  center of this immense sea cavern rose the towers of a splendid  castle, all built of coral inlaid with silver and having windows of  clear glass.    Surrounding the castle were beds of beautiful sea flowers, many  being in full bloom, and these were laid out with great care in  artistic designs. Goldfish and silverfish darted here and there  among the foliage, and the whole scene was so pretty and peaceful  that Trot began to doubt there was any danger lurking in such a  lovely place.    As they approached to look around them, a brilliantly colored  gregfish approached and gazed at them curiously with his big,  saucer-like eyes. \"So Zog has got you at last!\" he said in a pitying  tone. \"How foolish you were to swim into that part of the sea where  he is powerful.\"    \"The sea devils made us,\" explained Clia.    \"Well, I'm sorry for you, I'm sure,\" remarked the Greg, and with a  flash of his tail, he disappeared among the sea foliage.    \"Let us go to the castle,\" said the Queen in a determined voice. \"We  may as well boldly defy our fate as to wait until Zog seeks us out.\"    So they swam to the entrance of the castle. The doors stood wide  open, and the interior seemed as well lighted as the cavern itself,  although none of them could discover from whence the light came.    At each side of the entrance lay a fish such as they had never seen  before. It was flat as a doormat and seemed to cling fast to the  coral floor. Upon its back were quills like those of a porcupine,  all pointed and sharp. From the center of the fish arose a head  shaped like a round ball, with a circle of piercing, bead-like eyes  set in it. These strange guardians of the entrance might be able to  tell what their numerous eyes saw, yet they remained silent and  watchful. Even Aquareine gazed upon them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],[0,"The Master Key (#13)"],[1,"lighted, and crowds of pleasure  seekers thronged them everywhere.  Rob experienced a decided sense of  relief as he mixed with the gay populace and enjoyed the sights of the  splendid city, for it enabled him to forget, for a time, the  responsibilities thrust upon him by the possession of the Demon's  marvelous electrical devices.          13.  Rob Loses His Treasures      Our young adventurer had intended to pass the night in the little bed  at his hotel, but the atmosphere of Paris proved so hot and  disagreeable that he decided it would be more enjoyable to sleep while  journeying through the cooler air that lay far above the earth's  surface.  So just as the clocks were striking the midnight hour Rob  mounted skyward and turned the indicator of the traveling machine to  the east, intending to make the city of Vienna his next stop.    He had risen to a considerable distance, where the air was remarkably  fresh and exhilarating, and the relief he experienced from the close  and muggy streets of Paris was of such a soothing nature that he  presently fell fast asleep.  His day in the metropolis had been a busy  one, for, like all boys, he had forgotten himself in the delight of  sight-seeing and had tired his muscles and exhausted his strength to an  unusual degree.    It was about three o'clock in the morning when Rob, moving restlessly  in his sleep, accidently touched with his right hand the indicator of  the machine which was fastened to his left wrist, setting it a couple  of points to the south of east.  He was, of course, unaware of the  slight alteration in his course, which was destined to prove of serious  importance in the near future.  For the boy's fatigue induced him to  sleep far beyond daybreak, and during this period of unconsciousness he  was passing over the face of European countries and approaching the  lawless and dangerous dominions of the Orient.    When, at last, he opened his eyes, he was puzzled to determine where he  was.  Beneath him stretched a vast, sandy plain, and speeding across  this he came to a land abounding in luxuriant vegetation.    The centrifugal force which propelled him was evidently, for some  reason, greatly accelerated, for the scenery of the country he was  crossing glided by him at so rapid a rate of speed that it nearly took  his breath away.    \"I wonder if I've passed Vienna in the night,\" he thought.  \"It ought  not to have taken me more than a few hours to reach there from Paris.\"    Vienna was at that moment fifteen hundred miles behind him; but Rob's  geography had always been his stumbling block at school, and he had not  learned to gage the speed of the traveling machine; so he was  completely mystified as to his whereabouts.    Presently a village having many queer spires and minarets whisked by  him like a flash.  Rob became worried, and resolved to slow up at the  next sign of habitation.    This was a good resolution, but Turkestan is so thinly settled that  before the boy could plan out a course of action he had passed the  barren mountain range of Thian-Shan as nimbly as an acrobat leaps a  jumping-bar.    \"This won't do at all!\" he exclaimed, earnestly.  \"The traveling  machine seems to be running away with me, and I'm missing no end of  sights by scooting along up here in the clouds.\"    He turned the indicator to zero, and was relieved to find it obey with  customary quickness.  In a few moments he had slowed up and stopped,  when he found himself suspended above another stretch of sandy plain.  Being too high to see the surface of the plain distinctly he dropped  down a few hundred feet to a lower level, where he discovered he was  surrounded by billows of sand as far as his eye could reach.    \"It's a desert, all right,\" was his comment; \"perhaps old Sahara  herself.\"    He started the machine again towards the east, and at a more moderate  rate of speed skimmed over the surface of the desert.  Before long he  noticed a dark spot ahead of him which proved to be a large body of  fierce looking men, riding upon dromedaries and slender, spirited  horses and armed with long rifles and crookedly shaped simitars.    \"Those fellows seem to be looking for trouble,\" remarked the boy, as he  glided over them, \"and it wouldn't be exactly healthy for an enemy to  get in their way.  But I haven't time to stop, so I'm not likely to get  mixed up in any rumpus with them.\"    However, the armed caravan was scarcely out of sight before Rob  discovered he was approaching a rich, wooded oasis of the desert, in  the midst of which was built the walled city of Yarkand.  Not that he  had ever heard of the place, or knew its name; for few Europeans and  only one American traveler had ever visited it.  But he guessed it was  a city of some importance from its size and beauty, and resolved to  make a stop there.    Above the high walls projected many slender, white minarets, indicating  that the inhabitants were either Turks or some race of Mohammedans; so  Rob decided to make investigations before trusting himself to their  company.    A cluster of tall trees with leafy tops stood a short distance outside  the walls, and here the boy landed and sat down to rest in the  refreshing shade.    The city seemed as hushed and still as if it were deserted, and before  him stretched the vast plain of white, heated sands.  He strained his  eyes to catch a glimpse of the band of warriors he had passed, but they  were moving slowly and had not yet appeared.    The trees that sheltered Rob were the only ones without the city,  although many low bushes or shrubs grew scattering over the space  between him and the walls.  An arched gateway broke the enclosure at  his left, but the gates were tightly shut.    Something in the stillness and the intense heat of the mid-day sun made  the boy drowsy.  He stretched himself upon the ground beneath the dense  foliage of the biggest tree and abandoned himself to the languor that  was creeping over him.    \"I'll wait until that army of the desert arrives,\" he thought,  sleepily.  \"They either belong in this city or have come to capture it,  so I can tell better what to dance when I find out what the band plays.\"    The next moment he was sound asleep, sprawling upon his back in the  shade and slumbering as peacefully as an infant.    And while he lay motionless three men dropped in quick succession from  the top of the city wall and hid among the low bushes, crawling  noiselessly from one to another and so approaching, by degrees, the  little group of trees.    They were Turks, and had been sent by those in authority within the  city to climb the tallest tree of the group and discover if the enemy  was near.  For Rob's conjecture had been correct, and the city of  Yarkand awaited, with more or less anxiety, a threatened assault from  its hereditary enemies, the Tatars.    The three spies were not less forbidding in appearance than the horde  of warriors Rob had passed upon the desert.  Their features were coarse  and swarthy, and their eyes had a most villainous glare.  Old fashioned  pistols and double-edged daggers were stuck in their belts and their  clothing, though of gorgeous colors, was soiled and neglected.    With all the caution of the American savage these Turks approached the  tree, where, to their unbounded amazement, they saw the boy lying  asleep.  His dress and fairness of skin at once proclaimed him, in  their shrewd eyes, a European, and their first thought was to glance  around in search of his horse or dromedary.  Seeing nothing of the kind  near they were much puzzled to account for his presence, and stood  looking down at him with evident curiosity.    The sun struck the polished surface of the traveling machine which was  attached to Rob's wrist and made the metal glitter like silver.  This  attracted the eyes of the tallest Turk, who stooped down and stealthily  unclasped the band of the machine from the boy's outstretched arm.  Then, after a hurried but puzzled examination of the little instrument,  he slipped it into the pocket of his jacket.    Rob stirred uneasily in his sleep, and one of the Turks drew a slight  but stout rope from his breast and with gentle but deft movement passed  it around the boy's wrists and drew them together behind him.  The  action was not swift enough to arouse the power of repulsion in the  Garment of Protection, but it awakened Rob effectually, so that he sat  up and stared hard at his captors.    \"What are you trying to do, anyhow?\" he demanded.    The Turks laughed and said something in their own language.  They had  no knowledge of English.    \"You're only making fools of yourselves,\" continued the boy,  wrathfully.  \"It's impossible for you to injure me.\"    The three paid no attention to his words.  One of them thrust his hand  into Rob's pocket and drew out the electric tube.  His ignorance of  modern appliances was so great that he did not know enough to push the  button.  Rob saw him looking down the hollow end of the tube and  murmured:    \"I wish it would blow your ugly head off!\"    But the fellow, thinking the shining metal might be of some value to  him, put the tube in his own pocket and then took from the prisoner the  silver box of tablets.    Rob writhed and groaned at losing his possessions in this way, and  while his hands were fastened behind him tried to feel for and touch  the indicator of the traveling machine.  When he found that the machine  also had been taken, his anger gave way to fear, for he realized he was  in a dangerously helpless condition.    The third Turk now drew the Record of Events from the boy's inner  pocket.  He knew nothing of the springs that opened the lids, so, after  a curious glance at it, he secreted the box in the folds of his sash  and continued the search of the captive.  The Character Marking  Spectacles were next abstracted, but the Turk, seeing in them nothing  but spectacles, scornfully thrust them back into Rob's"]]]
