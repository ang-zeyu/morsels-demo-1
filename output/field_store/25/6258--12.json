The brooding spirit of life itself  is there; and the summer may burst out in a moment.    He was born in an interval of a rapid mid-night journey in March,  at a place in the neighbourhood of Arezzo, the thin, clear air of  which was then thought to be favourable to the [78] birth of  children of great parts.  He came of a race of grave and dignified  men, who, claiming kinship with the family of Canossa, and  some colour of imperial blood in their veins, had, generation after  generation, received honourable employment under the  government of Florence.  His mother, a girl of nineteen years, put  him out to nurse at a country house among the hills of Settignano,  where every other inhabitant is a worker in the marble quarries,  and the child early became familiar with that strange first stage in  the sculptor's art.  To this succeeded the influence of the sweetest  and most placid master Florence had yet seen, Domenico  Ghirlandajo.  At fifteen he was at work among the curiosities of  the garden of the Medici, copying and restoring antiques,  winning the condescending notice of the great Lorenzo.  He knew  too how to excite strong hatreds; and it was at this time that in a  quarrel with a fellow-student he received a blow on the face  which deprived him for ever of the comeliness of outward form.    It was through an accident that he came to study those works of  the early Italian sculptors which suggested much of his own  grandest work, and impressed it with so deep a sweetness.  He  believed in dreams and omens.  One of his friends dreamed twice  that Lorenzo, then lately dead, appeared to him in grey and dusty  apparel.  To Michelangelo this dream seemed to portend the  troubles which afterwards really came, and with [79] the  suddenness which was characteristic of all his movements, he left  Florence.  Having occasion to pass through Bologna, he  neglected to procure the little seal of red wax which the stranger  entering Bologna must carry on the thumb of his right hand.  He  had no money to pay the fine, and would have been thrown into  prison had not one of the magistrates interposed.  He remained in  this man's house a whole year, rewarding his hospitality by  readings from the Italian poets whom he loved.  Bologna, with its  endless colonnades and fantastic leaning towers, can never have  been one of the lovelier cities of Italy.  But about the portals of its  vast unfinished churches and its dark shrines, half hidden by  votive flowers and candles, lie some of the sweetest works of the  early Tuscan sculptors, Giovanni da Pisa and Jacopo della  Quercia, things as winsome as flowers; and the year which  Michelangelo spent in copying these works was not a lost year.  It was now, on returning to Florence, that he put forth that unique  presentment of Bacchus, which expresses, not the mirthfulness of  the god of wine, but his sleepy seriousness, his enthusiasm, his  capacity for profound dreaming.  No one ever expressed more  truly than Michelangelo the notion of inspired sleep, of faces  charged with dreams.  A vast fragment of marble had long lain  below the Loggia of Orcagna, and many a sculptor had had his  thoughts of a design which should just fill this famous block of  [80] stone, cutting the diamond, as it were, without loss.  Under  Michelangelo's hand it became the David which stood till lately  on the steps of the Palazzo Vecchio, when it was replaced below  the Loggia.  Michelangelo was now thirty years old, and his  reputation was established.  Three great works fill the remainder  of his life--three works often interrupted, carried on through a  thousand hesitations, a thousand disappointments, quarrels with  his patrons, quarrels with his family, quarrels perhaps most of all  with himself--the Sistine Chapel, the Mausoleum of Julius the  Second, and the Sacristy of San Lorenzo.    In the story of Michelangelo's life the strength, often turning to  bitterness, is not far to seek.  A discordant note sounds  throughout it which almost spoils the music.  He \"treats the Pope  as the King of France himself would not dare to treat him\": he  goes along the streets of Rome \"like an executioner,\" Raphael  says of him.  Once he seems to have shut himself up with the  intention of starving himself to death.  As we come, in reading  his life, on its harsh, untempered incidents, the thought again and  again arises that he is one of those who incur the judgment of  Dante, as having \"wilfully lived in sadness.\"  Even his tenderness  and pity are embittered by their strength.  What passionate  weeping in that mysterious figure which, in the Creation of  Adam, crouches below the image of the Almighty, as he comes  with the forms of things to be, woman [81] and her progeny, in  the fold of his garment!  What a sense of wrong in those two  captive youths, who feel the chains like scalding water on their  proud and delicate flesh!  The idealist who became a reformer  with Savonarola, and a republican superintending the fortification  of Florence--the nest where he was born, il nido ove naqqu'io, as  he calls it once, in a sudden throb of affection--in its last struggle  for liberty, yet believed always that he had imperial blood in his  veins and was of the kindred of the great Matilda, had within the  depths of his nature some secret spring of indignation or sorrow.  We know little of his youth, but all tends to make one believe in  the vehemence of its passions.  Beneath the Platonic calm of the  sonnets there is latent a deep delight in carnal form and colour.  There, and still more in the madrigals, he often falls into the  language of less tranquil affections; while some of them have the  colour of penitence, as from a wanderer returning home.  He who  spoke so decisively of the supremacy in the imaginative world of  the unveiled human form had not been always, we may think, a  mere Platonic lover.  Vague and wayward his loves may have  been; but they partook of the strength of his nature, and  sometimes, it may be, would by no means become music, so that  the comely order of his days was quite put out: par che amaro  ogni mio dolce io senta.    But his genius is in harmony with itself; and [82] just as in the  products of his art we find resources of sweetness within their  exceeding strength, so in his own story also, bitter as the ordinary  sense of it may be, there are select pages shut in among the rest--  pages one might easily turn over too lightly, but which yet  sweeten the whole volume.  The interest of Michelangelo's  poems is that they make us spectators of this struggle; the  struggle of a strong nature to adorn and attune itself; the struggle  of a desolating passion, which yearns to be resigned and sweet  and pensive, as Dante's was.  It is a consequence of the  occasional and informal character of his poetry, that it brings us  nearer to himself, his own mind and temper, than any work done  only to support a literary reputation could possibly do.  His letters  tell us little that is worth knowing about him--a few poor quarrels  about money and commissions.  But it is quite otherwise with  these songs and sonnets, written down at odd moments,  sometimes on the margins of his sketches, themselves often  unfinished sketches, arresting some salient feeling or  unpremeditated idea as it passed.  And it happens that a true  study of these has become within the last few years for the first  time possible.  A few of the sonnets circulated widely in  manuscript, and became almost within Michelangelo's own  lifetime a subject of academical discourses.  But they were first  collected in a volume in 1623 by the great-nephew of  Michelangelo, Michelangelo Buonarroti the younger.  He omitted  [83] much, re-wrote the sonnets in part, and sometimes  compressed two or more compositions into one, always losing  something of the force and incisiveness of the original.  So the  book remained, neglected even by Italians themselves in the last  century, through the influence of that French taste which despised  all compositions of the kind, as it despised and neglected Dante.  \"His reputation will ever be on the increase, because he is so little  read,\" says Voltaire of Dante.--  But in 1858 the last of the  Buonarroti bequeathed to the municipality of Florence the  curiosities of his family.  Among them was a precious volume  containing the autograph of the sonnets.  A learned Italian, Signor  Cesare Guasti, undertook to collate this autograph with other  manuscripts at the Vatican and elsewhere, and in 1863 published  a true version of Michelangelo's poems, with dissertations and a  paraphrase.*    People have often spoken of these poems as if they were a  mere cry of distress, a lover's complaint over the obduracy of  Vittoria Colonna.  But those who speak thus forget that though it  is quite possible that Michelangelo had seen Vittoria, that  somewhat shadowy figure, as early as 1537, yet their closer  intimacy did not begin till about the year 1542, when  Michelangelo was nearly seventy years old.  Vittoria herself, an  ardent neo-catholic, vowed to perpetual widowhood since the  news [84] had reached her, seventeen years before, that her  husband, the youthful and princely Marquess of Pescara, lay dead  of the wounds he had received in the battle of Pavia, was then no  longer an object of great passion.  In a dialogue written by the  painter, Francesco d' Ollanda, we catch a glimpse of them  together in an empty church at Rome, one Sunday afternoon,  discussing indeed the characteristics of various schools of art, but  still more the writings of Saint Paul, already following the ways  and tasting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4065"],[0,"Side-Lights on Astronomy and Kindred Fields of Popular Science (#13)"],[1,"are  scattered in space; in other words, what is the volume of space which,  on the average, contains a single star. This method gives a thickness  of the stars greater by about twenty-five per cent, than that derived  from the measures of parallax. That is to say, a sphere like the second  we have proposed, having a radius 800,000 times the distance of the  sun, and therefore a diameter 1,600,000 times this distance, would,  judging by the proper motions, have ten or twelve stars contained  within it, while the measures of parallax only show eight stars within  the sphere of this diameter having the sun as its centre. The  probabilities are in favor of the result giving the greater thickness  of the stars. But, after all, the discrepancy does not change the  general conclusion as to the limits of the visible universe. If we  cannot estimate its extent with the same certainty that we can  determine the size of the earth, we can still form a general idea of it.    The estimates we have made are based on the supposition that the stars  are equally scattered in space. We have good reason to believe that  this is true of all the stars except those of the Milky Way. But, after  all, the latter probably includes half the whole number of stars  visible with a telescope, and the question may arise whether our  results are seriously wrong from this cause. This question can best be  solved by yet another method of estimating the average distance of  certain classes of stars.    The parallaxes of which we have heretofore spoken consist in the change  in the direction of a star produced by the swing of the earth from one  side of its orbit to the other. But we have already remarked that our  solar system, with the earth as one of its bodies, has been journeying  straightforward through space during all historic times. It follows,  therefore, that we are continually changing the position from which we  view the stars, and that, if the latter were at rest, we could, by  measuring the apparent speed with which they are moving in the opposite  direction from that of the earth, determine their distance. But since  every star has its own motion, it is impossible, in any one case, to  determine how much of the apparent motion is due to the star itself,  and how much to the motion of the solar system through space. Yet, by  taking general averages among groups of stars, most of which are  probably near each other, it is possible to estimate the average  distance by this method. When an attempt is made to apply it, so as to  obtain a definite result, the astronomer finds that the data now  available for the purpose are very deficient. The proper motion of a  star can be determined only by comparing its observed position in the  heavens at two widely separate epochs. Observations of sufficient  precision for this purpose were commenced about 1750 at the Greenwich  Observatory, by Bradley, then Astronomer Royal of England. But out of  3000 stars which he determined, only a few are available for the  purpose. Even since his time, the determinations made by each  generation of astronomers have not been sufficiently complete and  systematic to furnish the material for anything like a precise  determination of the proper motions of stars. To determine a single  position of any one star involves a good deal of computation, and if we  reflect that, in order to attack the problem in question in a  satisfactory way, we should have observations of 1,000,000 of these  bodies made at intervals of at least a considerable fraction of a  century, we see what an enormous task the astronomers dealing with this  problem have before them, and how imperfect must be any determination  of the distance of the stars based on our motion through space. So far  as an estimate can be made, it seems to agree fairly well with the  results obtained by the other methods. Speaking roughly, we have  reason, from the data so far available, to believe that the stars of  the Milky Way are situated at a distance between 100,000,000 and  200,000,000 times the distance of the sun. At distances less than this  it seems likely that the stars are distributed through space with some  approach to uniformity. We may state as a general conclusion, indicated  by several methods of making the estimate, that nearly all the stars  which we can see with our telescopes are contained within a sphere not  likely to be much more than 200,000,000 times the distance of the sun.    The inquiring reader may here ask another question. Granting that all  the stars we can see are contained within this limit, may there not be  any number of stars outside the limit which are invisible only because  they are too far away to be seen?    This question may be answered quite definitely if we grant that light  from the most distant stars meets with no obstruction in reaching us.  The most conclusive answer is afforded by the measure of starlight. If  the stars extended out indefinitely, then the number of those of each  order of magnitude would be nearly four times that of the magnitude  next brighter. For example, we should have nearly four times as many  stars of the sixth magnitude as of the fifth; nearly four times as many  of the seventh as of the sixth, and so on indefinitely. Now, it is  actually found that while this ratio of increase is true for the  brighter stars, it is not so for the fainter ones, and that the  increase in the number of the latter rapidly falls off when we make  counts of the fainter telescopic stars. In fact, it has long been known  that, were the universe infinite in extent, and the stars equally  scattered through all space, the whole heavens would blaze with the  light of countless millions of distant stars separately invisible even  with the telescope.    The only way in which this conclusion can be invalidated is by the  possibility that the light of the stars is in some way extinguished or  obstructed in its passage through space. A theory to this effect was  propounded by Struve nearly a century ago, but it has since been found  that the facts as he set them forth do not justify the conclusion,  which was, in fact, rather hypothetical. The theories of modern science  converge towards the view that, in the pure ether of space, no single  ray of light can ever be lost, no matter how far it may travel. But  there is another possible cause for the extinction of light. During the  last few years discoveries of dark and therefore invisible stars have  been made by means of the spectroscope with a success which would have  been quite incredible a very few years ago, and which, even to-day,  must excite wonder and admiration. The general conclusion is that,  besides the shining stars which exist in space, there may be any number  of dark ones, forever invisible in our telescopes. May it not be that  these bodies are so numerous as to cut off the light which we would  otherwise receive from the more distant bodies of the universe? It is,  of course, impossible to answer this question in a positive way, but  the probable conclusion is a negative one. We may say with certainty  that dark stars are not so numerous as to cut off any important part of  the light from the stars of the Milky Way, because, if they did, the  latter would not be so clearly seen as it is. Since we have reason to  believe that the Milky Way comprises the more distant stars of our  system, we may feel fairly confident that not much light can be cut off  by dark bodies from the most distant region to which our telescopes can  penetrate. Up to this distance we see the stars just as they are. Even  within the limit of the universe as we understand it, it is likely that  more than one-half the stars which actually exist are too faint to be  seen by human vision, even when armed with the most powerful  telescopes. But their invisibility is due only to their distance and  the faintness of their intrinsic light, and not to any obstructing  agency.    The possibility of dark stars, therefore, does not invalidate the  general conclusions at which our survey of the subject points. The  universe, so far as we can see it, is a bounded whole. It is surrounded  by an immense girdle of stars, which, to our vision, appears as the  Milky Way. While we cannot set exact limits to its distance, we may yet  confidently say that it is bounded. It has uniformities running through  its vast extent. Could we fly out to distances equal to that of the  Milky Way, we should find comparatively few stars beyond the limits of  that girdle. It is true that we cannot set any definite limit and say  that beyond this nothing exists. What we can say is that the region  containing the visible stars has some approximation to a boundary. We  may fairly anticipate that each successive generation of astronomers,  through coming centuries, will obtain a little more light on the  subject--will be enabled to make more definite the boundaries of our  system of stars, and to draw more and more probable conclusions as to  the existence or non-existence of any object outside of it. The wise  investigator of to-day will leave to them the task of putting the  problem into a more positive shape.          V    MAKING AND USING A TELESCOPE      The impression is quite common that satisfactory views of the heavenly  bodies can be obtained only with very large telescopes, and that the  owner of a small one must stand at a great disadvantage alongside of  the fortunate possessor of a great one. This is not true to the extent  commonly supposed. Sir William Herschel would have been delighted to  view the moon through what we should now consider a very modest  instrument; and there are some objects, especially the moon, which  commonly present a more pleasing aspect through a small telescope than  through a large one. The numerous owners of small telescopes throughout  the country might find their instruments much more interesting than  they do if they"]]]
