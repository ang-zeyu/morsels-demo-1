[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8417"],[0,"What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#13)"],[1,"was merely a  farce, though a very useless and inconvenient one, I permitted the  arrangement rather than make a row and retard my progress, and set out  with the young prince, Hamed, Farhan, and two camels and drivers,  leaving Imam and the other nine camels, with their drivers, behind, to  follow as soon as I should send back.    At the western extremity of the valley we came upon a small mound of  earth, all white and glistening, covered with nitre in an efflorescent  form, which shone so conspicuously in the sun, it could be seen at  many miles' distance; from the base of it a clear spring of water  trickled, so disagreeable in taste that no one, save Somali, could  possibly drink it. Now, emerging from the low land, we again left the  trees behind us, and rose by a well-beaten foot-track to the primary  level of the country, where stone and bare ground prevailed. Each of  these elevations and depressions was a mere reflection of the other,  only varying more or less according to their size; and as my line was  directed due west, I always had the mountain-range at even distance on  the north, whilst every feature on the south remained the same. It was  monotonous in the extreme. At the fifth mile we came upon some springs  of bitter water, sunk in deep cavities in the earth, from which we  filled our water-skins, and travelled on till night; when, dark  overtaking us, we slipped into a hollow in the ground, called Ali,  cooked a little rice with the water we had brought, and slept it out  till morning. Distance, thirteen miles.    22d.--As soon as the morning was well aired with the sun, and the  black men had recovered from the torpor which the cold seemed to  produce on them as it does on lizards and snakes, I struck out for Jid  Ali, hoping to surprise the Abban, and thereby counteract, if  possible, his various machinations. But this was not to be done. At  the thirteenth mile, as we were descending in full view of Jid Ali, at  a place called Birhamir, I was met by the Akil Husayn Hadji himself,  who, instead of showing any disposition to hinder my approach, was  very affable and kind in manner. He politely begged me to remain where  I was and rest the day, and on the morrow he would take me to the Tug  (river) below. He had never felt indisposed towards me; but one Galed  Ali, an Akil superior to himself, was averse to my proceeding further.  Unfortunately for the Somali, their lies are very transparent, and  they were too fond of uttering falsehoods ever to be trusted. I  neither believed in the existence of Galed Ali, nor in his own kind  intentions towards me, and therefore begged him to prove it by  allowing me to pass. This began a long discussion. The wars were  raging. The Dulbahantas would not let me see their country, as they  could not see why an Englishman should wish to travel where even  beggars were afraid to go; and then followed a hundred other excuses,  all of which I rejected as freely as he advanced them.    Then at length, Somali fashion, the true meaning of his unwelcome  visit transpired. He then said--\"Well, if you have no fear of  anything, and will join us in our fight, to represent your nation's  disposition in our favour, I will give you as many horses as you may  wish to have, and a free passage to Berbera, as soon as it is  concluded.\" This was certainly a tempting offer, as I told him; but I  said, Although, as far as I was individually concerned, there was  nothing which would please me better, still, being a servant of the  Government, I could not represent anything they had not sanctioned;  and, moreover, I was bound to be at Berbera by a certain date, which I  could not if I went southwards with them. They argued, There would be  no delay in finishing the battles, if I merely showed myself as a  representative of the English, for the enemy would retire before a  shot was fired, concluding that the opinion of the world was against  them. They all declared the war had lasted so long, and had been so  harassing, they wished ardently to put an end to it. I told them, in  my opinion, it was all their own fault; that they ought never to have  commenced the war, for the chief they now recognised was a mere  usurper--a traitor, in fact, who ought to be punished.    The Abban's mother, Mrs Awado, of whom I knew nothing until now, and  who was living at Birhamir, in a hut close by, then hastened towards  us, joined our party, and interrupted the conversation by clapping her  hands and beating her knees, exclaiming, in wild dismay and terrifying  words, \"Oh! why have you come to this land, where there are no laws,  or any respect for life? You don't know what these people are you've  come amongst! Come with me now to my place; rest the night, and  refresh yourself: tomorrow morning your Abban will come and conduct  you safely on your way.\" This was a climax to the day's journey; the  men smelt grub in an instant, and hurried off with the old lady to  some empty stone enclosures (sheepfolds), and at once unburdened and  \"lay-to\" for the night. As before, I had many conferences about the  THE WADI NOGAL, which Lieutenant Burton had desired me to investigate,  but could obtain no satisfactory information. They said there were  many wadis in Nogal, but the largest one was in the Mijjertaine  country, where its waters were deep and large, with extensive forest  around it, frequented by numerous herds of elephants. Those in advance  of my line of march, on the road to Berbera, were all mere nullahs,  like Yubbé Tug, or Jid Ali Tug, and were not used for agricultural  purposes. However, in the southern Dulbahanta country, south by west  of this, at a distance of five or six marches, there was a nullah,  with many springs in it, which united in certain places, and became a  running stream. This I now, from subsequent inquiries and inspection  of Lieut. Cruttenden's map,[18] suspect is the watercourse set down in  my instructions as the Wadi Nogal. This watercourse, I was assured,  bounded the Nogal or white stony country on the west, and divided it  from the Haud or red stoneless country, which is occupied in most part  by the southern Dulbahantas, who have \"the finest grazing-grounds in  the world, and possess incalculable numbers of camels and horses  (meaning ponies), and cows, sheep, and goats; whilst the game which  roamed about there covered the ground like flocks of sheep.\" Of these  the largest were giraffes, rhinoceroses, and lions, elephants being  confined to the Mijjertaine country, the Koolies hills to the south of  Berbera, and the Webbé Shebéli, or Haines River.[19]    23d.--Early in the morning, accompanied by Husayn Ali, who opposed me  no longer, we commenced our descent to the valley of Jid Ali, an  expansive flat several miles in breadth, fuller and better wooded in  the north than any place I had yet seen, but tapering away to the  south and eastwards, until it became lost to sight in the barren  plateau. After marching a mile or so, we found the Abban hastening to  meet us, in high dudgeon with my men for having advanced contrary to  his mandates, before he had time to arrive and smooth the way; for now  the great impressive spell, his influence, which I was to understand  could alone save me from the terrors of the unruly Dulbahantas, was  proved to me of secondary importance, and he, consequently,  insignificant. This occasioned a little delay; but at last, the Abban  becoming reconciled to this defeat of his projected plans, we were  permitted to resume the march, and, soon arriving in the bed of the  valley, encamped near the watercourse of Jid Ali Tug, on the meridian  of Mai. The water in the nullah extended upwards of half a mile, when  it became absorbed in the thirsty soil. It consisted of a chain of  pools, connected by little runners, the produce of some bitter  springs, and made the country green in consequence. Attracted by my  dates and rice--for I had brought no other property save my  specimen-boxes and ammunition--many of the Dulbahantas forgot their  occupations in war, and flocked around my camp all day and night,  bothering my servants incessantly whilst cooking, and begging presents  from me every moment. I remained here three days, trying to negotiate  with the head men for permission to advance, but obtained no practical  result. They insisted, for even coming thus far, that I should give  them as many cloths and material as I had given to the Warsingali, for  they would take no less. When told all my worldly goods did not admit  of such a payment, they quietly said, I had come there against their  will; they did not believe me; and if I did not open my boxes to their  inspection, they would smash them up and help themselves. This was an  everyday occurrence, which became only insignificant, as it was  repeated without being carried into execution. Most of the time the  Abban was away, stopping at his home, and no business could be done. I  therefore took short excursions about the valley shooting, and  inspecting the various habitations.    Animals were more abundant, in consequence of the greater extent of  water; and I shot gazelles, little saltiana antelopes, hares, Egyptian  geese, rock-pigeons, ducks and teal, and snipe and partridge, besides  a choice collection of small birds. In one place I found a small stone  hut, occupied by an old man who had once been on a pilgrimage to  Mecca, and had seen the art of cultivating ground. He was now turning  his experience to account by growing jowari (a species of millet), and  effected it with some success; for he had two small enclosures, which  he irrigated by cuts from the nullah, that produced grain, which grew  from eight to nine feet high. He was loud in praise of the advantages  which he derived from his farm, saying it saved his flocks, and  assisted him in the means of food when his ewes were pregnant, or  giving lamb. I patronised this farmer, and offered to lend him some  tools"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8419"],[0,"The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804-1806 (#13)"],[1," from 3 to 5 Ms. apart and higher Some places being 160 or 180  feet the river not So wide We made a Mast of Cotton wood, to day in the  Course of the evening & night it turned of a butifull red Colour          [Clark, July 2, 1804]  July 2nd, 1804 Set out early and proceeed on the left of the islands,  two of which are large a high bottom Situated on the L.
