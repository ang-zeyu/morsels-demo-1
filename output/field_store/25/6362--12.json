Views ev'ry bell, and hums th' approving sound;  Poised on her busy plumes, with feeling nice  She draws from every flower, nor tries a floret twice.     He fears no bailiff's wrath, no baron's blame,  His is untax'd and undisputed game:  Nor less the place of curious plant he knows;  He both his Flora and his Fauna shows;  For him is blooming in its rich array  The glorious flower which bore the palm away;  In vain a rival tried his utmost art,  His was the prize, and joy o'erflow'd his heart.     \"This, this! is beauty; cast, I pray, your eyes  On this my glory! see the grace! the size!  Was ever stem so tall, so stout, so strong,  Exact in breadth, in just proportion long?  These brilliant hues are all distinct and clean,  No kindred tint, no blending streaks between:  This is no shaded, run-off, pin-eyed thing;  A king of flowers, a flower for England's king:  I own my pride, and thank the favouring star  Which shed such beauty on my fair Bizarre.\"     Thus may the poor the cheap indulgence seize,  While the most wealthy pine and pray for ease;  Content not always waits upon success,  And more may he enjoy who profits less.     Walter and William took (their father dead)  Jointly the trade to which they both were bred;  When fix'd, they married, and they quickly found  With due success their honest labours crown'd;  Few were their losses, but although a few,  Walter was vex'd and somewhat peevish grew:  \"You put your trust in every pleading fool,\"  Said he to William, and grew strange and cool.  \"Brother forbear,\" he answer'd; \"take your due,  Nor let my lack of caution injure you:\"  Half friends they parted,--better so to close,  Than longer wait to part entirely foes.     Walter had knowledge, prudence, jealous care;  He let no idle views his bosom share;  He never thought nor felt for other men -  \"Let one mind one, and all are minded then.\"  Friends he respected, and believed them just,  But they were men, and he would no man trust;  He tried and watch'd his people day and night, -  The good it harm'd not; for the bad 'twas right:  He could their humours bear, nay disrespect,  But he could yield no pardon to neglect;  That all about him were of him afraid  \"Was right,\" he said--\"so should we be obey'd.\"     These merchant-maxims, much good fortune too,  And ever keeping one grand point in view,  To vast amount his once small portion drew.     William was kind and easy; he complied  With all requests, or grieved when he denied;  To please his wife he made a costly trip,  To please his child he let a bargain slip;  Prone to compassion, mild with the distress'd,  He bore with all who poverty profess'd,  And some would he assist, nor one would he arrest.  He had some loss at sea, bad debts at land,  His clerk absconded with some bills in hand,  And plans so often fail'd, that he no longer plann'd.  To a small house (his brother's) he withdrew,  At easy rent--the man was not a Jew;  And there his losses and his cares he bore,  Nor found that want of wealth could make him poor.     No, he in fact was rich! nor could he move,  But he was follow'd by the looks of love;  All he had suffer'd, every former grief,  Made those around more studious in relief;  He saw a cheerful smile in every face,  And lost all thoughts of error and disgrace.   Pleasant it was to see them in their walk  Round their small garden, and to hear them talk;  Free are their children, but their love refrains  From all offence--none murmurs, none complains;  Whether a book amused them, speech or play,  Their looks were lively, and their hearts were gay;  There no forced efforts for delight were made,  Joy came with prudence, and without parade;  Their common comforts they had all in view,  Light were their troubles, and their wishes few:  Thrift made them easy for the coming day,  Religion took the dread of death away;  A cheerful spirit still ensured content,  And love smiled round them wheresoe'er they went.     Walter, meantime, with all his wealth's increase,  Gain'd many points, but could not purchase peace;  When he withdrew from business for an hour,  Some fled his presence, all confess'd his power;  He sought affection, but received instead  Fear undisguised, and love-repelling dread;  He look'd around him--\"Harriet, dost thou love?\"  \"I do my duty,\" said the timid dove;  \"Good Heav'n, your duty! prithee, tell me now -  To love and honour--was not that your vow?  Come, my good Harriet, I would gladly seek  Your inmost thought--Why can't the woman speak?  Have you not all things?\"--\"Sir, do I complain?\" -  \"No, that's my part, which I perform in vain;  I want a simple answer, and direct -  But you evade; yes! 'tis as I suspect.  Come then, my children! Watt! upon your knees  Vow that you love me.\"--\"Yes, sir, if you please.\"  \"Again!  By Heav'n, it mads me; I require  Love, and they'll do whatever I desire:  Thus too my people shun me; I would spend  A thousand pounds to get a single friend;  I would be happy--I have means to pay  For love and friendship, and you run away:  Ungrateful creatures! why, you seem to dread  My very looks; I know you wish me dead.  Come hither, Nancy! you must hold me dear;  Hither, I say; why! what have you to fear?  You see I'm gentle--Come, you trifler, come:  My God! she trembles!--Idiot, leave the room!  Madam; your children hate me; I suppose  They know their cue; you make them all my foes:  I've not a friend in all the world--not one:  I'd be a bankrupt sooner; nay, 'tis done;  In every better hope of life I fail,  You're all tormentors, and my house a jail.  Out of my sight! I'll sit and make my will -  What, glad to go? stay, devils, and be still;  'Tis to your Uncle's cot you wish to run,  To learn to live at ease and be undone;  Him you can love, who lost his whole estate,  And I, who gain you fortunes, have your hate;  'Tis in my absence you yourselves enjoy:  Tom! are you glad to lose me? tell me, boy:  Yes! does he answer?--Yes! upon my soul;  No awe, no fear, no duty, no control!  Away! away! ten thousand devils seize  All I possess, and plunder where they please!  What's wealth to me?--yes, yes! it gives me sway,  And you shall feel it--Go! begone, I say.\" {4}        LETTER IX.

Common Amusements of a Bathing-place--Morning Rides, Walks, &c.--  Company resorting to the Town--Different Choice of Lodgings--Cheap  Indulgences--Seaside Walks--Wealthy Invalid--Summer evening on the  Sands--Sea Productions--\"Water parted from the Sea\"--Winter Views  serene--In what cases to be avoided--Sailing upon the River--A small  Islet of Sand off the Coast--Visited by Company--Covered by the  Flowing of the Tide--Adventure in that place.    OF our Amusements ask you?--We amuse  Ourselves and friends with seaside walks and views,  Or take a morning ride, a novel, or the news;  Or, seeking nothing, glide about the street,  And so engaged, with various parties meet;  Awhile we stop, discourse of wind and tide  Bathing and books, the raffle, and the ride;  Thus, with the aid which shops and sailing give,  Life passes on; 'tis labour, but we live.     When evening comes, our invalids awake,  Nerves cease to tremble, heads forbear to ache;  Then cheerful meals the sunken spirits raise,  Cards or the dance, wine, visiting, or plays.     Soon as the season comes, and crowds arrive,  To their superior rooms the wealthy drive;  Others look round for lodging snug and small,  Such is their taste--they've hatred to a hall:  Hence one his fav'rite habitation gets,  The brick-floor'd parlour which the butcher lets;  Where, through his single light, he may regard  The various business of a common yard,  Bounded by backs of buildings form'd of clay,  By stable, sties, and coops, et caetera.     The needy-vain, themselves awhile to shun,  For dissipation to these dog-holes run;  Where each (assuming petty pomp) appears,  And quite forgets the shopboard and the shears.     For them are cheap amusements:  they may slip  Beyond the town and take a private dip;  When they may urge that, to be safe they mean,  They've heard there's danger in a light machine;  They too can gratis move the quays about,  And gather kind replies to every doubt;  There they a pacing, lounging tribe may view,  The stranger's guides, who've little else to do;  The Borough's placemen, where no more they gain  Than keeps them idle, civil, poor, and vain.  Then may the poorest with the wealthy look  On ocean, glorious page of Nature's book!  May see its varying views in every hour,  All softness now, then rising with all power,  As sleeping to invite, or threat'ning to devour:  'Tis this which gives us all our choicest views;  Its waters heal us, and its shores amuse.     See! those fair nymphs upon that rising strand,  Yon long salt lake has parted from the land;  Well pleased to press that path, so clean, so pure,  To seem in danger, yet to feel secure;  Trifling with terror, while they strive to shun  The curling billows; laughing as they run;  They know the neck that joins the shore and sea,  Or, ah! how changed that fearless laugh would be.     Observe how various Parties take their way,  By seaside walks, or make the sand-hills gay;  There group'd are laughing maids and sighing swains,  And some apart who feel unpitied pains;  Pains from diseases, pains which those who feel,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon — Complete (#13)"],[1,"his wife was sparing with her tears: and  what if he hadn't treated her so well!  But when you come to women, women  all belong to the kite species: no one ought to waste a good turn upon  one of them; it's just like throwing it down a well!  An old love's like  a cancer!\"          CHAPTER THE FORTY-THIRD.    He was becoming very tiresome, and Phileros cried out, \"Let's think about  the living!  He has what was coming to him, he lived respectably, and  respectably he died.  What's he got to kick about'?  He made his pile  from an as, and would pick a quadrans out of a dunghill with his teeth,  any old time.  And he grew richer and richer, of course: just like a  honeycomb.  I expect that he left all of a hundred thousand, by Hercules,  I do!  All in cold cash, too; but I've eaten dog's tongue and must speak  the truth: he was foul-mouthed, had a ready tongue, he was a trouble  maker and no man.  Now his brother was a good fellow, a friend to his  friend, free-handed, and he kept a liberal table.  He picked a loser at  the start, but his first vintage set him upon his legs, for he sold his  wine at the figure he demanded, and, what made him hold his head higher  still, he came into a legacy from which he stole more than had been left  to him.  Then that fool friend of yours, in a fit of anger at his  brother, willed his property away to some son-of-a-bitch or other, who  he was, I don't know, but when a man runs away from his own kin, he has  a long way to go!  And what's more, he had some slaves who were  ear-specialists at the keyhole, and they did him a lot of harm, for a man  won't prosper when he believes, on the spot, every tale that he hears; a  man in business, especially.  Still, he had a good time as long as he  lived: for happy's the fellow who gets the gift, not the one it was meant  for.  He sure was Fortune's son!  Lead turned to gold in his hands.  It's  easy enough when everything squares up and runs on schedule.  How old  would you think he was?  Seventy and over, but he was as tough as horn,  carried his age well, and was as black as a crow.  I knew the fellow for  years and years, and he was a lecher to the very last.  I don't believe  that even the dog in his house escaped his attentions, by Hercules, I  don't; and what a boy-lover he was!  Saw a virgin in every one he met!  Not that I blame him though, for it's all he could take with him.\"          CHAPTER THE FORTY-FOURTH.    Phileros had his say and Ganymedes exclaimed, \"You gabble away about  things that don't concern heaven or earth: and none of you cares how the  price of grain pinches.  I couldn't even get a mouthful of bread today,  by Hercules, I couldn't.  How the drought does hang on!  We've had famine  for a year.  If the damned AEdiles would only get what's coming to them.  They graft with the bakers, scratch-my-arse-and-I'll-scratch-yours!  That's the way it always is, the poor devils are out of luck, but the  jaws of the capitalists are always keeping the Saturnalia.  If only we  had such lion-hearted sports as we had when I first came from Asia!  That  was the life!  If the flour was not the very best, they would beat up  those belly-robbing grafters till they looked like Jupiter had been at  them.  How well I remember Safinius; he lived near the old arch, when I  was a boy.  For a man, he was one hot proposition!  Wherever he went, the  ground smoked!  But he was square, dependable, a friend to a friend, you  could safely play mora with him, in the dark.  But how he did peel them  in the town hall: he spoke no parables, not he!  He did everything  straight from the shoulder and his voice roared like a trumpet in the  forum.  He never sweat nor spat.  I don't know, but I think he had a  strain of the Asiatic in him.  And how civil and friendly-like he was,  in returning everyone's greeting; called us all by name, just like he was  one of us!  And so provisions were cheap as dirt in those days.  The loaf  you got for an as, you couldn't eat, not even if someone helped you, but  you see them no bigger than a bull's eye now, and the hell of it is that  things are getting worse every day; this colony grows backwards like a  calf's tall!  Why do we have to put up with an AEdile here, who's not  worth three Caunian figs and who thinks more of an as than of our lives?  He has a good time at home, and his daily income's more than another  man's fortune.  I happen to know where he got a thousand gold pieces.  If we had any nuts, he'd not be so damned well pleased with himself!  Nowadays, men are lions at home and foxes abroad.  What gets me is, that  I've already eaten my old clothes, and if this high cost of living keeps  on, I'll have to sell my cottages!  What's going to happen to this town,  if neither gods nor men take pity on it?  May I never have any luck if I  don't believe all this comes from the gods!  For no one believes that  heaven is heaven, no one keeps a fast, no one cares a hang about Jupiter:  they all shut their eyes and count up their own profits.  In the old  days, the married women, in their stolas, climbed the hill in their bare  feet, pure in heart, and with their hair unbound, and prayed to Jupiter  for rain!  And it would pour down in bucketfuls then or never, and they'd  all come home, wet as drowned rats.  But the gods all have the gout now,  because we are not religious; and so our fields are burning up!\"          CHAPTER THE FORTY-FIFTH.    \"Don't be so down in the mouth,\" chimed in Echion, the ragman; \"if it  wasn't that it'd be something else, as the farmer said, when he lost his  spotted pig.  If a thing don't happen today, it may tomorrow.  That's the  way life jogs along.  You couldn't name a better country, by Hercules,  you couldn't, if only the men had any brains.  She's in hot water right  now, but she ain't the only one.  We oughtn't to be so particular;  heaven's as far away everywhere else.  If you were somewhere else, you'd  swear that pigs walked around here already roasted.  Think of what's  coming!  We'll soon have a fine gladiator show to last for three days, no  training-school pupils; most of them will be freedmen.  Our Titus has a  hot head and plenty of guts and it will go to a finish.  I'm well  acquainted with him, and he'll not stand for any frame-ups.  It will be  cold steel in the best style, no running away, the shambles will be in  the middle of the amphitheatre where all the crowd can see.  And what's  more, he has the coin, for he came into thirty million when his father  had the bad luck to die.  He could blow in four hundred thousand and his  fortune never feel it, but his name would live forever.  He has some  dwarfs already, and a woman to fight from a chariot.  Then, there's  Glyco's steward; he was caught screwing Glyco's wife.  You'll see some  battle between jealous husbands and favored lovers.  Anyhow, that cheap  screw of a Glyco condemned his steward to the beasts and only published  his own shame.  How could the slave go wrong when he only obeyed orders?  It would have been better if that she-piss-pot, for that's all she's fit  for, had been tossed by the bull, but a fellow has to beat the saddle  when he can't beat the jackass.  How could Glyco ever imagine that a  sprig of Hermogenes' planting could turn out well?  Why, Hermogenes could  trim the claws of a flying hawk, and no snake ever hatched out a rope  yet!  And look at Glyco!  He's smoked himself out in fine shape, and as  long as he lives, he'll carry that stain!  No one but the devil himself  can wipe that out, but chickens always come home to roost.  My nose tells  me that Mammaea will set out a spread: two bits apiece for me and mine!  And he'll nick Norbanus out of his political pull if he does; you all  know that it's to his interest to hump himself to get the best of him.  And honestly, what did that fellow ever do for us?  He exhibited some two  cent gladiators that were so near dead they'd have fallen flat if you  blew your breath at them.  I've seen better thugs sent against wild  beasts!  And the cavalry he killed looked about as much like the real  thing as the horsemen on the lamps; you would have taken them for  dunghill cocks!  One plug had about as much action as a jackass with a  pack-saddle; another was club-footed; and a third who had to take the  place of one that was killed, was as good as dead, and hamstrung into the  bargain.  There was only one that had any pep, and he was a Thracian, but  he only fought when we egged him on.  The whole crowd was flogged  afterwards.  How the mob did yell 'Lay it on!'  They were nothing but  runaways.  And at that he had the nerve to say, 'I've given you a show.'  'And I've applauded,' I answered; 'count it up and you'll find that I  gave more than I got!  One hand washes the other.'\"          CHAPTER THE FORTY-SIXTH    \"Agamemnon, your looks seem to say, What's this boresome nut trying to  hand us?'  Well, I'm talking because you, who can talk book-foolishness,  won't.  You don't belong to our bunch, so you laugh in your sleeve at the  way us poor people talk, but we know that you're only a fool with a lot  of learning.  Well, what of it?  Some day I'll get you to come to my  country place and take a look at my little estate.  We'll have fresh eggs  and spring chicken to chew on when we get there; it will be all right  even if the weather has kept things back this year.  We'll find enough to  satisfy us, and my kid will soon grow up to be a pupil of yours; he can  divide up to four, now, and you'll have a little servant at your side, if  he lives.  When he has a minute to himself, he never takes his eyes from  his tablets; he's smart too, and has the right kind of stuff in him, even  if he is crazy about birds.  I've had to kill three of his linnets  already.  I told him that a weasel had gotten them, but he's found  another hobby, now he paints all the time.  He's left the marks of his  heels on his Greek already, and is doing pretty well"]]]
