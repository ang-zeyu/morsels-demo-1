[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54335"],[0,"The Women of Mormondom (#13)"],[1,"daughters of Zion perfectly  understood it nearly fifty years ago.    Joseph was indeed a sublime and daring oracle. Such a conception  grasped even before he laid the foundation stone of a Zion--that all  America is to be the New Jerusalem of the world and of the future--was  worthy to make him the prophet of America.    Zion was not a county in Missouri, a city in Ohio or Illinois; nor is  she now a mere embryo State in the Rocky Mountains.    Kirtland was but a \"stake of Zion\" where the first temple rose. Jackson  county is the enchanted spot where the \"centre stake\" of Zion is to be  planted, and the grand temple reared, by-and-by. Nauvoo with its temple  was another stake. Utah also is but a stake. Here we have already the  temple of St. George, and in Salt Lake City a temple is being built  which will be a Masonic unique to this continent.    Perchance it will stand in the coming time scarcely less a monument  to the name of its builder--Brigham Young--than the temple of Old  Jerusalem has been to the name of Solomon.    But all America is the world's New Jerusalem!    With this cardinal conception crowding the soul of the Mormon prophet,  inspired by the very archangels of Israel, what a vast Abrahamic drama  opened to the view of the saints in Kirtland when the first temple  lifted its sacred tower to the skies!    The archangels of Israel had come down to fulfill on earth the  grand Abrahamic programme. The two worlds--the visible and the  invisible--were quickly engaging in the divine action, to consummate,  in this \"dispensation of the fullness of times,\" the promises made unto  the fathers.    And all America for the God of Israel.    There is method in Mormonism--method infinite. Mormonism is Masonic.  The God of Israel is a covenant maker; the crown of the covenant is the  temple.    But woman must not be lost to view in our admiration of the prophet's  conceptions.    How stands woman in the grand temple economy, as she loomed up in her  mission, from the house of the Lord in Kirtland?    The apostles and elders laid the foundations, raised the arches, and  put on the cap stone; but it was woman that did the \"inner work of the  temple.\"    George A. Smith hauled the first load of rock; Heber C. Kimball worked  as an operative mason, and Brigham Young as a painter and glazier in  the house; but the sisters wrought on the \"veils of the temple.\"    Sister Polly Angel, wife of Truman O. Angel, the church architect,  relates that she and a band of sisters were working on the \"veils,\" one  day, when the prophet and Sidney Rigdon came in.    \"Well, sisters,\" observed Joseph, \"you are always on hand. The sisters  are always first and foremost in all good works. Mary was first at the  resurrection; and the sisters now are the first to work on the inside  of the temple.\"    'Tis but a simple incident, but full of significance. It showed  Joseph's instinctive appreciation of woman and her mission. Her place  was _inside_ the temple, and he was about to put her there,--a high  priestess of Jehovah, to whose name he was building temples. And  wonderfully suggestive was his prompting, that woman was the first  witness of the resurrection.    Once again woman had become an oracle of a new dispensation and a new  civilization. She can only properly be this when a temple economy comes  round in the unfolding of the ages. She can only be a legitimate oracle  _in_ the temple.    When she dares to play the oracle, without her divine mission and  anointing, she is accounted in society as a witch, a fortune-teller, a  medium, who divines for hire and sells the gift of the invisibles for  money.    But in the temple woman is a sacred and sublime oracle. She is a  prophetess and a high priestess. Inside the temple she cannot but be  as near the invisibles as man--nearer indeed, from her finer nature,  inside the mystic veil, the emblems of which she has worked upon with  her own hands.    Of old the oracle had a priestly royalty. The story of Alexander the  Great and the oracle of Delphi is famous. The conqueror demanded speech  from the oracle concerning his destiny. The oracle was a woman; and  womanlike she refused to utter the voice of destiny at the imperious  bidding of a mortal. But Alexander knew that woman was inspired--that  he held in his grip the incarnated spirit of the temple, and he essayed  to drag her to the holy ground where speech was given.    \"He is invincible!\" exclaimed the oracle, in wrath.    \"The oracle speaks!\" cried Alexander, in exultation.    The prophetess was provoked to an utterance; woman forced to obey the  stronger will of man; but it was woman's inspired voice that sent  Alexander through the world a conquering destiny.    And the prophet of Mormondom knew that woman is, by the gifts of God  and nature, an inspired being. If she was this in the temples of Egypt  and Greece, more abundantly is she this in the temples of Israel. In  them woman is the medium of Jehovah. This is what the divine scheme of  the Mormon prophet has made her to this age; and she began her great  mission to the world in the temple at Kirtland.    But this temple-building of the Mormons has a vaster meaning than the  temples of Egypt, the oracles of Greece, or the cathedrals of the  Romish Church.    It is the vast Hebrew iliad, begun with Abraham and brought down  through the ages, in a race still preserved with more than its original  quality and fibre; and in a God who is raising up unto Abraham a  mystical seed of promise, a latter-day Israel.    Jehovah is a covenant-maker. \"And I will make with Israel a new and  everlasting covenant,\" is the text that Joseph and Brigham have been  working upon. Hence this temple building in America, to fulfill and  glorify the new covenant of Israel.    The first covenant was made with Abraham and the patriarchs _in the  East_. The greater and the everlasting covenant will restore the  kingdom to Israel. That covenant has been made _in the West_, with  these veritable children of Abraham. God has raised up children unto  Abraham to fulfill the promises made to him. This is Mormonism.    The West is the future world. Yet how shall there be the new  civilization without its distinctive temples? Certainly there shall be  no Abrahamic dispensation and covenant unless symbolized by temples  raised to the name of the God of Israel!    All America, then, is Zion!    A hundred temples lifting their towers to the skies in the world's New  Jerusalem. Temples built to the name of the God of Israel.    Mark this august wonder of the age; the Mormons build not temples to  the name of Jesus, but to the name of Jehovah--not to the Son, but to  the Father.    The Hebrew symbol is not the cross, but the sceptre. The Hebrews know  nothing of the cross. It is the symbol of heathenism, whence Rome  received her signs and her worship. Rome adopted the cross and she has  borne it as her mark. She never reared her cathedrals to the name of  the God of Israel, nor has she taught the nations to fear his name. Nor  has she prophesied of the New Jerusalem of the last days, which must  supersede Rome and give the millennial civilization to the world.    The reign of Messiah! Temples to the Most High God! The sceptre, not  the cross!    There is a grand Masonic consistency in the divine scheme of the Mormon  prophet, and the sisters began to comprehend the infinite themes of  their religion when they worked in the temple at Kirtland, and beheld  in the service the glory of Israel's God.        CHAPTER XII.    ELIZA R. SNOW'S GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF THE TEMPLE AND ITS  DEDICATION--HOSANNAS TO GOD--HIS GLORY FILLS THE HOUSE.    The erection of the Kirtland temple was a leading characteristic of the  work of the last dispensation.    It was commenced in June, 1833, under the immediate direction of the  Almighty, through his servant, Joseph Smith, whom he had called in  his boyhood, like Samuel of old, to introduce the fullness of the  everlasting gospel.    At that time the saints were few in number, and most of them very poor;  and, had it not been for the assurance that God had spoken, and had  commanded that a house should be built to his name, of which he not  only revealed the form, but also designated the dimensions, an attempt  towards building that temple, under the then existing circumstances,  would have been, by all concerned, pronounced preposterous.    Although many sections of the world abounded with mosques, churches,  synagogues and cathedrals, built professedly for worship, this was  the first instance, for the lapse of many centuries, of God having  given a pattern, from the heavens, and manifested by direct revelation  how the edifice should be constructed, in order that he might accept  and acknowledge it as his own. This knowledge inspired the saints to  almost superhuman efforts, while through faith and union they acquired  strength. In comparison with eastern churches and cathedrals, this  temple is not large, but in view of the amount of available means  possessed, a calculation of the cost, at the lowest possible figures,  would have staggered the faith of any but Latter-day saints; and it now  stands as a monumental pillar.    Its dimensions are eighty by fifty-nine feet; the walls fifty feet  high, and the tower one hundred and ten feet. The two main halls  are fifty-five by sixty-five feet, in the inner court. The building  has four vestries in front, and five rooms in the attic, which were  devoted to literature, and for meetings of the various quorums of the  priesthood.    There was a peculiarity in the arrangement of the inner court which  made it more than ordinarily impressive--so much so that a sense of  sacred awe seemed to rest upon all who entered; not only the saints,  but strangers also manifested a high degree of reverential feeling.  Four pulpits stood, one above another, in the centre of the building,  from north to south, both on the east and west ends;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],[0,"Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#13)"],[1,"and worked at the tin business in sight of this dungeon  where the Prophet was so unjustly imprisoned and suffered so much, this  knowledge of the country was welcome news to me. On one occasion, as  I was informed by the late Bishop Alexander McRae, who was imprisoned  in this same jail, and as he substantially related to me, five of the  prisoners, viz: Joseph Smith, Hyrum, his brother, Caleb Baldwin, Lyman  Wight, Sidney Rigdon and Bishop McRae were taking supper together. All  but Brother McRae partook of tea, as they were glad to get anything to  sustain life. Soon afterwards five of the inmates were taken sick and  some of them were blind for three days, after which they were afflicted  with sore eyes for a long time. Bishop McRae escaped this affliction  as he did not partake of the tea. All of the six prisoners agreed that  poison had been put in the tea, but how and by whom was unknown to them.    While the prisoners were confined in this jail, young Joseph Smith and  Emma, his mother, visited their husband and father. It was at this time  that Joseph's son, now the leader of the Reorganized church, claims  to have received a blessing under the hands of his father. Joseph F.  Smith, with his mother, visited his father in this same jail, and  although but an infant, received a blessing under his hands. Owing to  the delicate state of her health, Joseph F.'s mother had to be taken  on a bed in a carriage, to see, perhaps for the last time, her husband  as a prisoner for the gospel's sake. The meeting and parting on that  occasion must have been heartrending under the circumstances. Very few  can now realize such days as those of the imprisonment at Liberty jail.    From the day that Joseph Smith received the plates at the hands of  Moroni, the angel, until his incarceration in Liberty jail, his life  was one of persecution, trial and imprisonment, so much so that on one  occasion Joseph was led to pray:    \"O God! where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy  hiding place? How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye--yea,  thy pure eye--behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people,  and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?  Yea O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful  oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened towards them, and  they bowels be moved with compassion towards them? O Lord God Almighty,  maker of the heaven and earth, and seas, and all things that in them  are, and who controlleth and subjecteth the devil and the dark and  benighted dominion of Sheol! Stretched forth thy hand; let think eye  pierce; let thy pavilion be taken up; let thy hiding place no longer be  covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine heart be softened, and  thy bowels moved with compassion towards us. * * * Remember thy suffering  Saints, O our God.\"    The Prophet loved the Saints, and he knew of their extreme suffering,  and their moving through mud and rain, in poverty, leaving their homes  and all behind them, while he, with his brethren, was in a dungeon  liable to be poisoned at any time. They knew their lives were not safe  in such a mobocratic state as was Missouri then. However, Joseph had  consolation, dark as it appeared, for he promised his brethren that not  one of their lives should be lost. In the midst of their cries unto the  Lord, he was answered thus:    \"My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversary and thine afflictions  shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God  shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes. Thou  art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither  charge thee with transgression, as they did Job. * * * Wo unto all those  that discomfort my people, and drive, and murder, and testify against  them, saith the Lord of Hosts. A generation of vipers shall not escape  the damnation of hell. * * * Let thy bowels also be full of charity  towards all men and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish  thy thoughts unceasingly. Then shall thy confidence wax strong in the  presence of God, and the doctrine of the Priesthood shall distill upon  thy soul as the dews from heaven. The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant  companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and  truth, and they dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without  compulsory means it shall flow unto thee for ever and ever.\"    When I looked upon the Liberty jail in 1834, again in 1838-39, and  for the last time in 1888, in the last stages of decay (it being 54  years from the time I first saw it), my soul was moved upon with deep  emotion, for thoughts of the past crowded upon my mind. Indeed, I felt  almost bewildered, and as if in a dream. It was only four years and  nine months after the Prophet left this dungeon that he was murdered,  dying as a martyr in Carthage jail, Hancock County, Illinois, on the  memorable 27th of June, 1844.    Elder Jenson, Bishop Black and myself obtained a photograph of the jail  as a relic, from which the engraving illustrating this article has been  taken. The jail was built about 1830, of hewn oak logs, and was only 14  by 14-1/2 feet in the clear. Soon after a stone wall two feet thick was  added, leaving a space of twelve inches between the logs and the stone  wall, which was filled in with loose stones, thus making a wall four  feet thick.    In order to show how particular the Prophet was regarding revelations  which he received from the Lord, I will relate an incident which  occurred in Liberty jail. While the Prophet was receiving a revelation,  the late Bishop Alexander McRae was writing as Joseph received it. Upon  this occasion Brother McRae suggested a slight change in the wording of  the revelation, when Joseph sternly asked:    \"Do you know who you are writing for?\"    Brother McRae, who at once discovered his mistake, begged the Prophet's  pardon for undertaking to correct the word of the Lord.    In March, 1839, and less than one month before leaving the jail, Joseph  received the word of the Lord, as follows:    \"The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall  have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee, while the pure  in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek  council, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand.  And thy people shall never be turned against thee by the testimony of  traitors. And although their influence shall cast thee into trouble,  into bars and walls, thou shalt be had in honor, and but for a small  moment and thy voice shall be more terrible in the midst of thy enemies  than the fierce lion, because of thy righteousness; and thy God shall  stand by thee forever and ever. If thou art called to pass through  tribulation; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in  perils by land or by sea; if thou are accused of all manner of false  accusations; if thy enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the  society of thy father and mother, and brethren and sisters; and if,  with a drawn sword, thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife  and of thine offspring, and thine elder son (Joseph), although but 6  years of age, ... and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies  prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb; and if thou  should be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the  sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if  the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine  enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to  hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell gape open the  mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall  give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of Man hath  descended below them all; art thou greater than he? Therefore hold on  thy way, and the Priesthood shall remain with thee, for their bounds  are set and they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years shall  not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God  shall be with you for ever and every.\"    CHAPTER 6    The Assassination of Generals Joseph and Hyrum Smith in Carthage,  Hancock Co., Ill., June 27, 1844, while under the pledged protection of  the Governor of the State.    The engraving presented on another page is a true representation of  the jail at Carthage, Illinois, wherein Joseph Smith, revered by  the \"Mormon\" people as a prophet of God, and his brother Hyrum were  foully murdered in 1844. A sketch of the building was made by the late  Robert Campbell soon after the massacre, from which the illustration  accompanying this sketch was made.    The mob of eighty men, whose faces were painted black, were under the  direction of the notorious Captain Williams, who is represented in the  picture as standing just back of the four men who are shooting the  Prophet as he is lying partially stunned against the well curb. The  Captain is directing the murder, as is to be seen in the engraving.  Farther to the right is Captain Smith, with his company of Carthage  Greys, who were entrusted with the care and custody of the prisoners  under the pledge of the Governor of the state for their safety.    In the afternoon of the day of the murder, the mob were concealed  in the woods about three-quarters of a mile northwest of the jail,  where they had previously marched. The front of the jail is to the  south. Communication for some time was kept up between the mob and  the Carthage Greys by couriers, until a perfect understanding was  effected between the two mobs, for by this mutual understanding the  State troops had become identified with the murder. The diabolical plot  was so arranged that the troops had their guns loaded only with blank  cartridges. From the situation of affairs, the disbanding of the troops  at Carthage (except"]]]
