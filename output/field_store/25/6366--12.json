Harker affected no surprise at all--he looked the  astonishment he felt as the younger man rose and motioned him to the  comfortable easy-chair which he himself had just previously taken.    \"Dear me!\" he exclaimed, nodding his thanks. \"I'd no idea that I should  meet you in these far-off parts, Dr. Bryce! This is a long way from  Wrychester, sir, for Wrychester folk to meet in.\"    \"I'd no idea of meeting you, Mr. Harker,\" responded Bryce. \"But it's  a small world, you know, and there are a good many coincidences in it.  There's nothing very wonderful in my presence here, though--I ran down  to see after a country practice--I've left Dr. Ransford.\"    He had the lie ready as soon as he set eyes on Harker, and whether  the old man believed it or not, he showed no sign of either belief or  disbelief. He took the chair which Bryce drew forward and pulled out an  old-fashioned cigar-case, offering it to his companion.    \"Will you try one, doctor?\" he asked. \"Genuine stuff that, sir--I've a  friend in Cuba who remembers me now and then. No,\" he went on, as Bryce  thanked him and took a cigar, \"I didn't know you'd finished with the  doctor. Quietish place this to practise in, I should think--much quieter  even than our sleepy old city.\"    \"You know it?\" inquired Bryce.    \"I've a friend lives here--old friend of mine,\" answered Harker. \"I come  down to see him now and then--I've been here since yesterday. He does a  bit of business for me. Stopping long, doctor?\"    \"Only just to look round,\" answered Bryce.    \"I'm off tomorrow morning--eleven o'clock,\" said Harker. \"It's a longish  journey to Wrychester--for old bones like mine.\"    \"Oh, you're all right!--worth half a dozen younger men,\" responded  Bryce. \"You'll see a lot of your contemporaries out, Mr. Harker.  Well--as you've treated me to a very fine cigar, now you'll let me treat  you to a drop of whisky?--they generally have something of pretty good  quality in these old-fashioned establishments, I believe.\"    The two travellers sat talking until bedtime--but neither made any  mention of the affair which had recently set all Wrychester agog with  excitement. But Bryce was wondering all the time if his companion's  story of having a friend at Barthorpe was no more than an excuse, and  when he was alone in his own bedroom and reflecting more seriously he  came to the conclusion that old Harker was up to some game of his own in  connection with the Paradise mystery.    \"The old chap was in the Library when Ambrose Campany said that there  was a clue in that Barthorpe history,\" he mused. \"I saw him myself  examining the book after the inquest. No, no, Mr. Harker!--the facts  are too plain--the evidences too obvious. And yet--what interest has a  retired old tradesman of Wrychester got in this affair? I'd give a good  deal to know what Harker really is doing here--and who his Barthorpe  friend is.\"    If Bryce had risen earlier next morning, and had taken the trouble to  track old Harker's movements, he would have learnt something that would  have made him still more suspicious. But Bryce, seeing no reason for  hurry, lay in bed till well past nine o'clock, and did not present  himself in the coffee-room until nearly half-past ten. And at that  hour Simpson Harker, who had breakfasted before nine, was in close  consultation with his friend--that friend being none other than the  local superintendent of police, who was confidentially closeted with the  old man in his private house, whither Harker, by previous arrangement,  had repaired as soon as his breakfast was over. Had Bryce been able to  see through walls or hear through windows, he would have been surprised  to find that the Harker of this consultation was not the quiet,  easy-going, gossipy old gentleman of Wrychester, but an eminently  practical and business-like man of affairs.    \"And now as regards this young fellow who's staying across there at the  Peacock,\" he was saying in conclusion, at the very time that Bryce was  leisurely munching his second mutton chop in the Peacock coffee-room,  \"he's after something or other--his talk about coming here to see after  a practice is all lies!--and you'll keep an eye on him while he's  in your neighbourhood. Put your best plainclothes man on to him at  once--he'll easily know him from the description I gave you--and let him  shadow him wherever he goes. And then let me know of his movement--he's  certainly on the track of something, and what he does may be useful  to me--I can link it up with my own work. And as regards the other  matter--keep me informed if you come on anything further. Now I'll go  out by your garden and down the back of the town to the station. Let me  know, by the by, when this young man at the Peacock leaves here, and, if  possible--and you can find out--for where.\"    Bryce was all unconscious that any one was interested in his movements  when he strolled out into Barthorpe market-place just after eleven.  He had asked a casual question of the waiter and found that the old  gentleman had departed--he accordingly believed himself free from  observation. And forthwith he set about his work of inquiry in his own  fashion. He was not going to draw any attention to himself by asking  questions of present-day inhabitants, whose curiosity might then be  aroused; he knew better methods than that. Every town, said Bryce to  himself, possesses public records--parish registers, burgess rolls,  lists of voters; even small towns have directories which are more  or less complete--he could search these for any mention or record of  anybody or any family of the name of Braden. And he spent all that day  in that search, inspecting numerous documents and registers and books,  and when evening came he had a very complete acquaintance with the  family nomenclature of Barthorpe, and he was prepared to bet odds  against any one of the name of Braden having lived there during the past  half-century. In all his searching he had not once come across the name.    The man who had spent a very lazy day in keeping an eye on Bryce, as he  visited the various public places whereat he made his researches, was  also keeping an eye upon him next morning, when Bryce, breakfasting  earlier than usual, prepared for a second day's labours. He followed  his quarry away from the little town: Bryce was walking out to Braden  Medworth. In Bryce's opinion, it was something of a wild-goose chase to  go there, but the similarity in the name of the village and of the dead  man at Wrychester might have its significance, and it was but a two  miles' stroll from Barthorpe. He found Braden Medworth a very small,  quiet, and picturesque place, with an old church on the banks of a river  which promised good sport to anglers. And there he pursued his tactics  of the day before and went straight to the vicarage and its vicar, with  a request to be allowed to inspect the parish registers. The vicar,  having no objection to earning the resultant fees, hastened to comply  with Bryce's request, and inquired how far back he wanted to search and  for what particular entry.    \"No particular entry,\" answered Bryce, \"and as to period--fairly recent.  The fact is, I am interested in names. I am thinking\"--here he used  one more of his easily found inventions--\"of writing a book on English  surnames, and am just now inspecting parish registers in the Midlands  for that purpose.\"    \"Then I can considerably simplify your labours,\" said the vicar, taking  down a book from one of his shelves. \"Our parish registers have been  copied and printed, and here is the volume--everything is in there from  1570 to ten years ago, and there is a very full index. Are you staying  in the neighbourhood--or the village?\"    \"In the neighbourhood, yes; in the village, no longer than the time I  shall spend in getting some lunch at the inn yonder,\" answered Bryce,  nodding through an open window at an ancient tavern which stood in the  valley beneath, close to an old stone bridge. \"Perhaps you will kindly  lend me this book for an hour?--then, if I see anything very noteworthy  in the index, I can look at the actual registers when I bring it back.\"    The vicar replied that that was precisely what he had been about to  suggest, and Bryce carried the book away. And while he sat in the inn  parlour awaiting his lunch, he turned to the carefully-compiled index,  glancing it through rapidly. On the third page he saw the name Bewery.    If the man who had followed Bryce from Barthorpe to Braden Medworth had  been with him in the quiet inn parlour he would have seen his quarry  start, and heard him let a stifled exclamation escape his lips. But the  follower, knowing his man was safe for an hour, was in the bar outside  eating bread and cheese and drinking ale, and Bryce's surprise was  witnessed by no one. Yet he had been so much surprised that if all  Wrychester had been there he could not, despite his self-training in  watchfulness, have kept back either start or exclamation.    Bewery! A name so uncommon that here--here, in this out-of-the-way  Midland village!--there must be some connection with the object of his  search. There the name stood out before him, to the exclusion of all  others--Bewery--with just one entry of figures against it. He turned to  page 387 with a sense of sure discovery.    And there an entry caught his eye at once--and he knew that he had  discovered more than he had ever hoped for. He read it again and again,  gloating over his wonderful luck.    June 19th, 1891. John Brake, bachelor, of the parish of St. Pancras,  London, to Mary Bewery, spinster, of this parish, by the Vicar.  Witnesses, Charles Claybourne, Selina Womersley, Mark Ransford.    Twenty-two years ago! The Mary Bewery whom Bryce knew in Wrychester was  just about twenty--this Mary Bewery,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#13)"],[1,"I pulled it  out of my pocket and tossed it to him.    \"Thanks,\" he said, as cool as you please. \"And here's your  horse-shoe. Fair exchange!\"    I burst out laughing, and he looked disconcerted, as I hoped he  would.    \"I thought you'd be in Brooklyn by now,\" I said, \"at 600 Abingdon  Avenue, laying out Chapter One. What do you mean by following me  this way? You nearly frightened me to death last night. I felt like  one of Fenimore Cooper's heroines, shut up in the blockhouse while  the redskins prowled about.\"    He flushed and looked very uncomfortable.    \"I owe you an apology,\" he said. \"I certainly never intended that  you should see me. I bought a ticket for New York and checked my  bag through. And then while I was waiting for the train it came  over me that your brother was right, and that it was a darned risky  thing for you to go jaunting about alone in Parnassus. I was afraid  something might happen. I followed along the road behind you,  keeping well out of sight.\"    \"Where were you while I was at Pratt's?\"    \"Sitting not far down the road eating bread and cheese,\" he said.  \"Also I wrote a poem, a thing I very rarely do.\"    \"Well, I hope your ears burned,\" I said, \"for those Pratts have  certainly raised you to the peerage.\"    He got more uncomfortable than ever.    \"Well,\" he said, \"I dare say it was all an error, but anyway I _did_  follow you. When you turned off into that lane, I kept pretty close  behind you. As it happens, I know this bit of country, and there are  very often some hoboes hanging around the old quarry up that lane.  They have a cave there where they go into winter quarters. I was  afraid some of them might bother you. You could hardly have chosen a  worse place to camp out. By the bones of George Eliot, Pratt ought  to have warned you. I can't conceive why you didn't stop at his  house overnight anyway.\"    \"If you must know, I got weary of hearing them sing your praises.\"    I could see that he was beginning to get nettled.    \"I regret having alarmed you,\" he said. \"I see that Peg has dropped  a shoe. If you'll let me fix it for you, after that I won't bother  you.\"    We turned back again along the road, and I noticed the right side of  his face for the first time. Under the ear was a large livid bruise.    \"That hobo, or whoever he was,\" I said, \"must have been a better  fighter than Andrew. I see he landed on your cheek. Are you always  fighting?\"    His annoyance disappeared. Apparently the Professor enjoyed a fight  almost as much as he did a good book.    \"Please don't regard the last twenty-four hours as typical of me,\"  he said with a chuckle. \"I am so unused to being a squire of dames  that perhaps I take the responsibilities too seriously.\"    \"Did you sleep at all last night?\" I asked. I think I began to  realize for the first time that the gallant little creature had been  out all night in a drizzling rain, simply to guard me from possible  annoyance; and I had been unforgivably churlish about it.    \"I found a very fine haystack in a field overlooking the quarry.  I crawled into the middle of it. A haystack is sometimes more  comfortable than a boarding-house.\"    \"Well,\" I said penitently, \"I can never forgive myself for the  trouble I've caused you. It was awfully good of you to do what  you did. Please put your cap on and don't catch cold.\"    We walked for several minutes in silence. I watched him out of the  corner of my eye. I was afraid he might have caught his death of  cold from being out all night in the wet, to say nothing of the  scuffle he had had with the tramp; but he really looked as chipper  as ever.    \"How do you like the wild life of a bookseller?\" he said.  \"You must read George Borrow. He would have enjoyed Parnassus.\"    \"I was just thinking, when I met you, that I could write a book  about my adventures.\"    \"Good!\" he said. \"We might collaborate.\"    \"There's another thing we might collaborate on,\" I said, \"and  that's breakfast. I'm sure you haven't had any.\"    \"No,\" he said, \"I don't think I have. I never lie when I know  I shan't be believed.\"    \"I haven't had any, either,\" I said. I thought that to tell an  untruth would be the least thing I could do to reward the little  man for his unselfishness.    \"Well,\" he said, \"I really thought that by this time--\"    He broke off. \"Was that Bock barking?\" he asked sharply.    We had been walking slowly, and had not yet reached the spot where  the lane branched from the main road. We were still about three  quarters of a mile from the place where I had camped overnight. We  both listened carefully, but I could hear nothing but the singing of  the telephone wires along the road.    \"No matter,\" he said. \"I thought I heard a dog.\" But I noticed that  he quickened his pace.    \"I was saying,\" he continued, \"that I had really thought to have  lost Parnassus for good by this morning, but I'm tickled to death to  have a chance to see her again. I hope she'll be as good a friend to  you as she has been to me. I suppose you'll sell her when you return  to the Sage?\"    \"I don't know I'm sure,\" I said. \"I must confess I'm still a little  at sea. My desire for an adventure seems to have let me in deeper  than I expected. I begin to see that there's more in this  bookselling game than I thought. Honestly, it's getting into my  blood.\"    \"Well, that's fine,\" he said heartily. \"I couldn't have left  Parnassus in better hands. You must let me know what you do with  her, and then perhaps, when I've finished my book, I can buy her  back.\"    We struck off into the lane. The ground was slippery under the trees  and we went single file, Mifflin in front. I looked at my watch--it  was nine o'clock, just an hour since I had left the van. As we  neared the spot Mifflin kept looking ahead through the birch trees  in a queer way.    \"What's the matter?\" I said. \"We're almost there, aren't we?\"    \"We _are_ there,\" he said. \"Here's the place.\"    Parnassus was gone!        CHAPTER TEN      We stood in complete dismay--I did, at any rate--for about as long  as it takes to peel a potato. There could be no doubt in which  direction the van had moved, for the track of the wheels was plain.  It had gone farther up the lane toward the quarry. In the earth,  which was still soggy, were a number of footprints.    \"By the bones of Polycarp!\" exclaimed the Professor, \"those hoboes  have stolen the van. I guess they think it'll make a fine Pullman  sleeper for them. If I'd realized there was more than one of them  I'd have hung around closer. They need a lesson.\"    Good Lord! I thought, here's Don Quixote about to wade into another  fight.    \"Hadn't we better go back and get Mr. Pratt?\" I asked.    This was obviously the wrong thing to say. It put the fiery little  man all the more on his mettle. His beard bristled. \"Nothing of the  sort!\" he said. \"Those fellows are cowards and vagabonds anyway.  They can't be far off; you haven't been away more than an hour, have  you? If they've done anything to Bock, by the bones of Chaucer, I'll  harry them. I _thought_ I heard him bark.\"    He hurried up the lane, and I followed in a panicky frame of mind.  The track wound along a hillside, between a high bank and a forest  of birch trees. I think the distance can't have been more than a  quarter of a mile. Anyway, in a very few minutes the road made a  sharp twist to the right and we found ourselves looking down into  the quarry, over a sheer rocky drop of a hundred feet at least.  Below, drawn over to one side of the wall of rock, stood Parnassus.  Peg was between the shafts. Bock was nowhere to be seen. Sitting by  the van were three disreputable looking men. The smoke of a cooking  fire rose into the air; evidently they were making free with my  little larder.    \"Keep back,\" said the Professor softly. \"Don't let them see us.\" He  flattened himself in the grass and crawled to the edge of the cliff.  I did the same, and we lay there, invisible from below, but quite  able to see everything in the quarry. The three tramps were  evidently enjoying an excellent breakfast.    \"This place is a regular hang-out for these fellows,\" Mifflin  whispered. \"I've seen hoboes about here every year. They go into  winter quarters about the end of October, usually. There's an old  blasted-out section of this quarry that makes a sheltered dormitory  for them, and as the place isn't worked any more they're not  disturbed here so long as they don't make mischief in the  neighbourhood. We'll give them....\"    \"Hands up!\" said a rough voice behind us. I looked round. There was  a fat, red-faced villainous-looking creature covering us with a  shiny revolver. It was an awkward situation. Both the Professor and  I were lying full length on the ground. We were quite helpless.    \"Get up!\" said the tramp in a husky, nasty voice. \"I guess youse  thought we wasn't covering our trail? Well, we'll have to tie you  up, I reckon, while we get away with this Crystal Pallis of yourn.\"    I scrambled to my feet, but to my surprise the Professor continued  to lie at full length.    \"Get up, deacon!\" said the tramp again. \"Get up on them graceful  limbs, _if_ you please.\"    I guess he thought himself safe from attack by a woman. At any rate,  he bent over as if to grab Mifflin by the neck. I saw my chance  and jumped on him from behind. I am heavy, as I have said, and he  sprawled on the ground. My doubts as to the pistol being loaded were  promptly dissolved, for it went off like a cannon. Nobody was in  front of it, however, and Mifflin was on his feet like a flash. He  had the ruffian by the throat and kicked the weapon out of his hand.  I ran to seize it.    \"You son of Satan!\" said the valiant Redbeard. \"Thought you could  bully us, did you? Miss McGill, you were as quick as Joan of Arc.  Hand me the pistol, please.\"    I gave it to him, and he shoved it under the hobo's nose.    \"Now,\" he said, \"take off that rag around your neck.\"    The rag was"]]]
