[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#13)"],[1,"(see  sec. 127) proves that they were in favor with the Lord and had been  _diligent_ and _patient_ and _persevering_ in their works. We have seen  too, from the Prophet's own words, that \"laboring with their might\"  meant _one-tenth_ of their _time_ or _means--a tithing_ of the people,  which is all the Lord had asked of them, and this could be redoubled  without any thought of lethargy or lack of diligence. There is no  sense in the Reorganite \"defender,\" being unreasonable, technical and  peevish in this matter to win a point for a dilapidated cause. There is  sufficient evidence given in this book; and it is not all that could  be given by any means, to show that the Saints labored faithfully,  diligently, and did all that the Lord required of them until they had  completed the Temple; and that, too, while they were being harassed,  persecuted, and in every way opposed by their enemies. All these facts  the \"defender\" very carefully avoids.    Another thing. Who was it that failed to be diligent and to labor  with their mights in building the Temple? Those scattered members who  refused to go to Nauvoo when commanded, and afterwards,--if we may  accept Reorganite testimony--became the nucleus of their Church! Those  who fled from Nauvoo with James J. Strang, Sidney Rigdon and William  Smith; forsaking the Church; refusing to assist in the completion of  the Temple; opposing the building of that edifice; even prophesying  that it would not be built, and blocking the progress of its erection!  Notwithstanding the Lord declared to Parley P. Pratt in a revelation  just following the martyrdom--which is accepted by the Reorganites as  genuine--\"Go and say unto _my people_ (not rejected) in Nauvoo, that  they shall continue to pursue their daily duties and take care of  themselves, and make no movement in _Church government_ to reorganize  or alter anything until the return of the remainder of the quorum of  the Twelve (not rejected). _But exhort them that they continue to build  the House of the Lord which I have commanded them to build in Nauvoo_.\"  (My comments and italics). Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, page 371).  Notwithstanding this commandment, some forsook Nauvoo and refused to  assist in building the Temple, and these were the ones who afterwards  became active members of the \"Reorganization.\" It will take more  evidence than a lot of innuendos, accusations, and downright sophistry  to prove that the Lord rejected those who labored diligently on the  Temple, according to His command, and accepted those who rejected the  Temple, and refused to assist in its erection.    12. Commenting on this the Reorganite \"defender\" says: \"On page 23 he  quotes from Sidney Rigdon, 'In the _Messenger_ and _Advocate_ for June,  1846;' and on next page (24) he says: 'At that time (June, 1846) the  temple was not quite finished.' On page 24, not finished in June, and  on page 23, finished on May 1st. On which page is he correct?\"    If the foregoing criticism was written through ignorance, of course the  writer may be excused, for one cannot be expected to furnish reasoning  powers to men who lack the capacity to understand a simple fact. But it  appears very forcibly that it is a deliberate prevarication, prepared  purposely to deceive, and thus shall I look upon it, rather than lay it  to his stupidity.    There is no contradiction whatever here, for I did not say, as he gives  it: \"At this time (June, 1846) the Temple was not quite finished.\"  The reference taken from the letter of Sidney Rigdon, appeared in  the _Messenger_ and _Advocate_ of June, 1846, along with a number of  other articles _written_ in March, April and May, 1846. Any greenhorn,  much less a man of wisdom and intelligence, knows that an article  appearing in a monthly magazine is _always written before_ the date  of publication of the magazine, and more was this the case in 1846,  when the modern improvements and facilities were not to be had by a  small country publication. Now, what I did say--which would have been  apparent to his readers had he dared to publish the statement of Sidney  Rigdon and my comment which proves the diligence of the Saints _up to_  the last--was this: \"This article was written just shortly after the  exodus commenced, and at _that time_ (i. e., shortly after the exodus  commenced) the Temple was not quite finished, but it was finished  before all the Saints left Nauvoo.\" (See context). This harmonizes  perfectly with the date of dedication. Moreover, Sidney Rigdon had  not been at Nauvoo since before the exodus commenced, which was in  February, 1846, not June, and was not prepared to say just what the  Saints did after that time.    13. In answer to the question, \"when was the Church rejected with  its dead?\" the president of the \"Reorganization\" in an editorial in  the Saints' Herald, February 17, 1905, said: \"We are not aware that  specific date or time, or any one specific act has been fixed upon as  _the_ time and _the_ event when and why the Church was rejected.\" He  then declares that the seed was sown as early as 1843 that finally grew  and culminated in the \"rejection of the Church.\"    Mr. Heman C. Smith quotes Lyman Wight (True Succession, p. 74) as  follows: \"We were to have sufficient time to build that house,  [Nauvoo Temple] during which time our baptisms for our dead should be  acceptable in the river. If we did not build within this time we were  to be rejected as a church, we and our dead together. Both the Temple  and baptizing went very leisurely, till the Temple was somewhere in  building the second story, when Brother Joseph from the stand announced  the alarming declaration that baptism for the dead was no longer  acceptable in the river. As much to say the time for building the  Temple had passed by, and both we and our dead were rejected together.  * * *    \"The Church now stands rejected together with their dead. The Church  being rejected now stands alienated from her God in every sense of the  word.\"    Mr. Heman C. Smith accepts this statement saying: \"What but blind  ambition to rule prevented others of the signers [Apostles] from  recognizing the consequence so apparent?\"    This was written by Lyman Wight in _1851_ and was an _afterthought_ on  his part, for he continued to work in the ministry until the death of  Joseph and Hyrum Smith, without one intimation by word or deed that  the Church had been rejected in 1841. Moreover, if the Saints could  get the structure of a building that cost a million dollars \"somewhere  in building the second story\" in that time of distress and trouble,  within _about six months_ they could not possibly have worked _very  leisurely_, and the Prophet in 1842 praised them for their diligence  and zeal. (See page 38).    Another Reorganite writer (A. M. Chase) in the Saints' Herald for June  20, 1906, declares that the Church was rejected in 1841: \"When this  appointment was ended by revelation, October 3, 1841, and the temple  not completed, then all Israel should have known they were 'rejected as  a church' with their dead.\"    It is quite evident that the sufficient time was up on this date, for  they were to have the privilege to baptize in the river \"while the time  was passing\" and this privilege of baptizing in the river terminated,  October 3, 1841, thus proving that the time had come for baptisms in  the Temple. It was not _finished_ and the revelation did not call for  it to be _finished_, and at this time it was _built_ sufficiently for  this ordinance to be attended to in the font in the proper way. For  that reason the Lord transferred the ordinance of baptism for the  dead from the river to the font of the Lord's House. That he had not  rejected the Church is evident from this very commandment, for in it  the Lord tells them to baptize in the font in the Temple, which He  would not have done had they been rejected. If He had rejected them He  would have stated so positively in a revelation to the Prophet, for  he received several revelations _after_ this event and some of them  were concerning baptism for the dead and temple work. (See sections  127 and 128). This commandment given to the Church in 1841 and other  revelations subsequently, prove conclusively that the Lord would and  did accept of the work for the dead in the Temple, without it being  \"completely finished,\" after the privilege to baptize in the river had  expired. The thing for which they were to be rejected was the failure  to perform these ordinances, _after the expiration of river baptisms_,  and the Saints did not fail to perform the ordinances in the Temple.    14. The Reorganite \"defender\" at this point carefully avoids the  evidence and argument presented here, and argues at great length  attempting to prove that the Church was rejected because the Lord  said He was \"_about_ to restore many things to the earth pertaining  to the Priesthood.\" The Lord said: \"I deign to reveal unto _My  Church_, things which have been kept hid from before the foundation  of the world, things that pertain to the dispensation of the fulnesss  of times.\" The \"defender\" says these things were not revealed, nor  restored to the Church; that no revelations that were kept hid from  before the foundation of the world, pertaining to the Priesthood in the  dispensation of the fulnesss of times, have been revealed from heaven;  therefore the Church was rejected with its dead. He says their Doctrine  and Covenants contains no such revelations; that no such revelations  are to be found in our edition of the Doctrine and Covenants; and,  therefore, he concludes, no such revelations have been given to us, or  the Church; so the Church must have been rejected.    He asks me to answer the following questions: \"Now let us ask, Mr.  Smith: Have any such revelations been received? Name them. Where are  they and what are they?\"    I have taken this matter up under the head of \"Temple Building and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#13)"],[1,"of war contracts, prompt  clearance of unneeded Government-owned equipment from private plants, and  other reconversion policies have greatly speeded up the beginning of  peacetime work in reconverted plants.    Although the first great shock of demobilization and war-work termination  has thus been met better than many observers expected, specific industries  and specific regions show much unevenness in the progress of reconversion.    The Quarterly Report of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion  analyzes the difficulties in recruiting personnel and obtaining materials  that hamper reconversion in certain industries and proposes policies to  deal with these situations. The lack of adequate housing is one of the main  factors checking the flow of workers into areas where job opportunities  exist.    FEDERAL REVENUE, BORROWING, AND THE    PUBLIC DEBT    I. FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS AND TAX POLICY    Recommendations for tax legislation should be considered not only in the  light of the financial requirements of the ensuing year, but also in the  light of future years' financial requirements and a full consideration of  economic conditions.    Expenditures are estimated at nearly 36 billion dollars in the fiscal year  1947; they can hardly be expected to be reduced to less than 25 billion  dollars in subsequent years. Net receipts in the fiscal year 1947 are  estimated at 31.5 billion dollars.    Included in this estimate are 2 billion dollars of receipts from disposal  and rental of surplus property and 190 million dollars of receipts from  renegotiation of wartime contracts. These sources of receipts will  disappear in future years. Tax collections for the fiscal year 1947 also  will not yet fully reflect the reduction in corporate tax liabilities  provided in the Revenue Act of 1945. If the extraordinary receipts from the  disposal of surplus property and renegotiation of contracts be disregarded,  and if the tax reductions adopted in the Revenue Act of 1945 were fully  effective, present tax rates would yield about 27 billion dollars.    These estimates for the fiscal year 1947 are based on the assumption of  generally favorable business conditions but not on an income reflecting  full employment and the high productivity that we hope to achieve. In  future years the present tax system, in conjunction with a full employment  level of national income, could be expected to yield more than 30 billion  dollars, which is substantially above the anticipated peacetime level of  expenditures.    In view of the still extraordinarily large expenditures in the coming year  and continuing inflationary pressures, I am making no recommendation for  tax reduction at this time.    We have already had a substantial reduction in taxes from wartime peaks.  The Revenue Act of 1945 was a major tax-reduction measure. It decreased the  total tax load by more than one-sixth, an amount substantially in excess of  the reductions proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury to congressional  tax committees in October 1945. These proposed reductions were designed to  encourage reconversion and peacetime business expansion.    The possibility of further tax reductions must depend on the budgetary  situation and the economic situation. The level of anticipated expenditures  for the fiscal year 1947 and the volume of outstanding public debt require  the maintenance of large revenues.    Moreover, inflationary pressures still appear dangerously powerful, and  ill-advised tax reduction would operate to strengthen them still further.    My decision not to recommend additional tax reductions at this time is made  in the light of existing economic conditions and prospects.    2. BORROWING AND THE PUBLIC DEBT    The successful conclusion of the Victory loan marked the end of war  borrowing and the beginning of the transition to postwar debt management.    Because of the success of the Victory loan, I am happy to report that the  Treasury will not need to borrow any new money from the public during the  remainder of the present fiscal year except through regular sales of  savings bonds and savings notes. Furthermore, a part of the large cash  balance now in the Treasury will be used for debt redemption so that the  public debt which now amounts to about 278 billion dollars will decrease by  several billion dollars during the next 18 months. The present statutory  debt limit of 300 billion dollars will provide an ample margin for all of  the public-debt transactions through the fiscal year 1947. The net effect  of the excess of expenditures and debt redemption on the Treasury cash  balance, as compared with selected previous years, is shown in the  following table:    EXCESS Of BUDGET EXPENDITURES, THE PUBLIC DEBT, AND THE TREASURY CASH  BALANCE IN SELECTED YEARS    Excess of At end of period    Budget ex- _____________________    penditures Public Cash bal-    Fiscal Year over receipts debt ance    1940 $3. 9 $43. 0 $1. 9    1945 53. 6 258. 7 24. 7 1946:    July-Dec. 1945 18. 1 278. 1 26. 0    Jan.-June 1946 10. 5 275. 0 11. 9    1947 4. 3 271. 0 3. 2    Although the public debt is expected to decline, a substantial volume of  refinancing will be required, because of the large volume of maturing  obligations. Redemptions of savings bonds also have been running high in  recent months and are expected to remain large for some time. The issuance  of savings bonds will be continued. These bonds represent a convenient  method of investment for small savers, and also an anti-inflationary method  of refinancing. Government agencies and trust funds are expected to buy  about 2.5 billion dollars of Government securities during the next 6  months, and 2.8 billion dollars more during the fiscal year 1947. Through  these and other debt operations, the distribution of the Federal debt among  the various types of public and private owners will change, even though the  total is expected to decline.    The interest policies followed in the refinancing operations will have a  major impact not only on the provision for interest payments in future  budgets, but also on the level of interest rates prevailing in private  financing. The average rate of interest on the debt is now a little under 2  percent. Low interest rates will be an important force in promoting the  full production and full employment in the postwar period for which we are  all striving. Close wartime cooperation between the Treasury Department and  the Federal Reserve System has made it possible to finance the most  expensive war in history at low and stable rates of interest. This  cooperation will continue.    No less important than the level of interest rates paid on the debt is the  distribution of its ownership. Of the total debt, more than half represents  direct savings of individuals or investments of funds received from  individual savings by life insurance companies, mutual savings banks,  savings and loan associations, private or Government trust funds, and other  agencies.    Most of the remaining debt--more than 100 billion dollars--is held by the  commercial banks and the Federal Reserve banks. Heavy purchases by the  banks were necessary to provide adequate funds to finance war expenditures.  A considerable portion of these obligations are short-term in character and  hence will require refinancing in the coming months and years. Since they  have been purchased out of newly created bank funds, continuance of the  present low rates of interest is entirely appropriate. To do otherwise  would merely increase bank profits at the expense of the taxpayer.    The 275-billion dollar debt poses a problem that requires careful  consideration in the determination of financial and economic policies. We  have learned that the problem, serious as it is, can be managed. Its  management will require determined action to keep our Federal Budget in  order and to relate our fiscal policies to the requirements of an expanding  economy. The more successful we are in achieving full production and full  employment the easier it will be to manage the debt and pay for the debt  service. Large though the debt is, it is within our economic capacity. The  interest charges on it amount to but a small proportion of our national  income. The Government is determined, by a resolute policy of economic  stabilization, to protect the interests of the millions of American  citizens who have invested in its securities.    During the past 6 months the net revenue receipts of the Federal Government  have been about 20 billion dollars, almost as much as during the closing 6  months of 1944 when the country was still engaged in all-out warfare. The  high level of these receipts reflects the smoothness of the reconversion  and particularly the strength of consumer demand. But the receipts so far  collected, it must be remembered, do not reflect any of the tax reductions  made by the Revenue Act of 1945. These reductions will not have their full  effect on the revenue collected until the fiscal year 1948.    It is good to move toward a balanced budget and a start on the retirement  of the debt at a time when demand for goods is strong and the business  outlook is good. These conditions prevail today. Business is good and there  are still powerful forces working in the direction of inflation. This is  not the time for tax reduction.    RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC FEDERAL ACTIVITIES    1. WAR LIQUIDATION AND NATIONAL DEFENSE    (a) War expenditures.    The fiscal year 1947 will see a continuance of war liquidation and  occupation. During this period we shall also lay the foundation for our  peacetime system of national defense.    In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 1945, almost wholly a period of  global warfare, war expenditures amounted to 90.5 billion dollars. For the  fiscal year 1946 war expenditures were originally estimated at 70 billion  dollars. That estimate was made a year ago while we"]]]
