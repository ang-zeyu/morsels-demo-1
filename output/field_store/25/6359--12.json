The soldiers holding his horse both turned and looked inquiringly at  the soldiers holding Nerle's horse; and these turned to look at a  double captain who came out of two doors in the wall and walked up to  them.    \"Such things were never before heard of!\" said the two captains, their  startled eyes fixed upon the prisoners.  \"We must take them to the Ki  and the Ki-Ki.\"    \"Why so?\" asked Prince Marvel.    \"Because,\" replied the officers, \"they are our rulers, under grace of  the High Ki, and all unusual happenings must be brought to their  notice.  It is our law, you know--the law of the Kingdom of Twi.\"    \"Very well,\" said Marvel, quietly; \"take us where you will; but if any  harm is intended us you will be made to regret it.\"    \"The Ki and the Ki-Ki will decide,\" returned the captains gravely,  their words sounding at the same instant.    And then the two pairs of soldiers led the horses through the double  streets, the captains marching ahead with drawn swords, and crowds of  twin men and twin women coming from the double doors of the double  houses to gaze upon the strange sight of men and horses who were not  double.    Presently they came upon a twin palace with twin turrets rising high  into the air; and before the twin doors the prisoners dismounted.  Marvel was escorted through one door and Nerle through another, and  then they saw each other going down a double hallway to a room with a  double entrance.    Passing through this they found themselves in a large hall with two  domes set side by side in the roof.  The domes were formed of stained  glass, and the walls of the hall were ornamented by pictures in pairs,  each pair showing identically the same scenes.  This, was, of course,  reasonable enough in such a land, where two people would always look at  two pictures at the same time and admire them in the same way with the  same thoughts.    Beneath one of the domes stood a double throne, on which sat the Ki of  Twi--a pair of gray-bearded and bald-headed men who were lean and lank  and stoop-shouldered.  They had small eyes, black and flashing, long  hooked noses, great pointed ears, and they were smoking two pipes from  which the smoke curled in exactly the same circles and clouds.    Beneath the other dome sat the Ki-Ki of Twi, also on double thrones,  similar to those of the Ki.  The Ki-Ki were two young men, and had  golden hair combed over their brows and \"banged\" straight across; and  their eyes were blue and mild in expression, and their cheeks pink and  soft.  The Ki-Ki were playing softly upon a pair of musical instruments  that resembled mandolins, and they were evidently trying to learn a new  piece of music, for when one Ki-Ki struck a false note the other Ki-Ki  struck the same false note at the same time, and the same expression of  annoyance came over the two faces at the same moment.    When the prisoners entered, the pairs of captains and soldiers bowed  low to the two pairs of rulers, and the Ki exclaimed--both in the same  voice of surprise:    \"Great Kika-koo! what have we here?\"    \"Most wonderful prisoners, your Highnesses,\" answered the captains.  \"We found them at your cities' gates and brought them to you at once.  They are, as your Highnesses will see, each singular, and but half of  what he should be.\"    \"'Tis so!\" cried the double Ki, in loud voices, and slapping their  right thighs with their right palms at the same time.  \"Most  remarkable!  Most remarkable!\"    \"I don't see anything remarkable about it,\" returned Prince Marvel,  calmly.  \"It is you, who are not singular, but double, that seem  strange and outlandish.\"    \"Perhaps--perhaps!\" said the two old men, thoughtfully.  \"It is what we  are not accustomed to that seems to us remarkable.  Eh, Ki-Ki?\" they  added, turning to the other rulers.    The Ki-Ki, who had not spoken a word but continued to play softly,  simply nodded their blond heads carelessly; so the Ki looked again at  the prisoners and asked:    \"How did you get here?\"    \"We cut a hole through the prickly hedge,\" replied Prince Marvel.    \"A hole through the hedge!  Great Kika-koo!\" cried the gray-bearded Ki;  \"is there, then, anything or any place on the other side of the hedge?\"    \"Why, of course!  The world is there,\" returned the prince, laughing.    The old men looked puzzled, and glanced sharply from their little black  eyes at their prisoners.    \"We thought nothing existed outside the hedge of Twi,\" they answered,  simply.  \"But your presence here proves we were wrong.  Eh! Ki-Ki?\"    This last was again directed toward the pair of musicians, who  continued to play and only nodded quietly, as before.    \"Now that you are here,\" said the twin Ki, stroking their two gray  beards with their two left hands in a nervous way, \"it must be evident  to you that you do not belong here.  Therefore you must go back through  the hedge again and stay on the other side.  Eh, Ki-Ki?\"    The Ki-Ki still continued playing, but now spoke the first words the  prisoners had heard from them.    \"They must die,\" said the Ki-Ki, in soft and agreeable voices.    \"Die!\" echoed the twin Ki, \"die?  Great Kika-koo!  And why so?\"    \"Because, if there is a world on the other side of the hedge, they  would tell on their return all about the Land of Twi, and others of  their kind would come through the hedge from curiosity and annoy us.  We can not be annoyed.  We are busy.\"    Having delivered this speech both the Ki-Ki went on playing the new  tune, as if the matter was settled.    \"Nonsense!\" retorted the old Ki, angrily.  \"You are getting more and  more bloodthirsty every day, our sweet and gentle Ki-Ki!  But we are  the Ki--and we say the prisoners shall not die!\"    \"We say they shall!\" answered the youthful Ki-Ki, nodding their two  heads at the same time, with a positive motion.  \"You may be the Ki,  but we are the Ki-Ki, and your superior.\"    \"Not in this case,\" declared the old men.  \"Where life and death are  concerned we have equal powers with you.\"    \"And if we disagree?\" asked the players, gently.    \"Great Kika-koo!  If we disagree the High Ki must judge between us!\"  roared the twin Ki, excitedly.    \"Quite so,\" answered the Ki-Ki.  \"The strangers shall die.\"    \"They shall not die!\" stormed the old men, with fierce gestures toward  the others, while both pairs of black eyes flashed angrily.    \"Then we disagree, and they must be taken to the High Ki,\" returned the  blond musicians, beginning to play another tune.    The two Ki rose from their thrones, paced two steps to the right and  three steps to the left, and then sat down again.    \"Very well!\" they said to the captains, who had listened unmoved to the  quarrel of the rulers; \"keep these half-men safe prisoners until  to-morrow morning, and then the Ki-Ki and we ourselves will conduct  them to the mighty High Ki.\"    At this command the twin captains bowed again to both pairs of rulers  and led Prince Marvel and Nerle from the room.  Then they were escorted  along the streets to the twin houses of the captains, and here the  officers paused and scratched their left ears with uncertain gestures.    \"There being only half of each of you,\" they said, \"we do not know how  to lock each of you in double rooms.\"    \"Oh, let us both occupy the same room,\" said Prince Marvel.  \"We prefer  it.\"    \"Very well,\" answered the captains; \"we must transgress our usual  customs in any event, so you may as well be lodged as you wish.\"    So Nerle and the prince were thrust into a large and pleasant room of  one of the twin houses, the double doors were locked upon them by twin  soldiers, and they were left to their own thoughts.        15.  The High Ki of Twi    \"Tell me, Prince, are we awake or asleep?\" asked Nerle, as soon as they  were alone.    \"There is no question of our being awake,\" replied the prince, with a  laugh.  \"But what a curious country it is--and what a funny people!\"    \"We can't call them odd or singular,\" said the esquire, \"for everything  is even in numbers and double in appearance.  It makes me giddy to look  at them, and I keep feeling of myself to make sure there is still only  one of me.\"    \"You are but half a boy!\" laughed the prince--\"at least so long as you  remain in the Land of Twi.\"    \"I'd like to get out of it in double-quick time,\" answered Nerle; \"and  we should even now be on the other side of the hedge were it not for  that wicked pair of Ki-Ki, who are determined to kill us.\"    \"It is strange,\" said the prince, thoughtfully, \"that the  fierce-looking old Ki should be our friends and the gentle Ki-Ki our  enemies.  How little one can tell from appearances what sort of heart  beats in a person's body!\"    Before Nerle could answer the two doors opened and two pairs of  soldiers entered.  They drew two small tables before the prince and two  before Nerle, and then other pairs of twin soldiers came and spread  cloths on the tables and set twin platters of meat and bread and fruit  on each of the tables.  When the meal had been arranged the prisoners  saw that there was enough for four people instead of two; and the  soldiers realized this also, for they turned puzzled looks first on the  tables and then on the prisoners.  Then they shook all their twin heads  gravely and went away, locking the twin doors behind them.    \"We have one advantage in being singular,\" said Nerle, cheerfully; \"and  that is we are not likely to starve to death.  For we can eat the  portions of our missing twins as well as our own.\"    \"I should think you would enjoy starving,\" remarked the prince.    \"No; I believe I have more exquisite suffering in store for me, since I  have met that gentle pair of Ki-Ki,\" said Nerle.    While they were eating the two captains came in and sat down in two  chairs.  These captains seemed friendly fellows, and after watching the  strangers for a while they remarked:    \"We are glad to see you able to eat so heartily; for to-morrow"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5180"],[0,"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Ruling (#13)"],[1,"about individual Web site requests  made by library patrons.  Finnell, whose consulting firm  specializes in data analysis, has substantial experience  evaluating Internet access logs generated on networked systems.  He spent more than a year developing a reporting tool for N2H2,  and, in the course of that work, acquired a familiarity with the  design and operation of Internet filtering products.      The Tacoma library uses Cyber Patrol filtering software, and  logs information only on sites that were blocked.  Finnell worked  from a list of all sites that were blocked in the Tacoma public  library in the month of August 2001.  The Westerville library  uses the Websense filtering product, and logs information on both  blocked sites and non-blocked sites.  When the logs reach a  certain size, they are overwritten by new usage logs.  Because of  this overwriting feature, logs were available to Finnell only for  the relatively short period from October 1, 2001 to October 3,  2001.  The Greenville library uses N2H2's filtering product and  logs both blocked sites and sites that patrons accessed.  The  logs contain more than 500,000 records per day.  Because of the  volume of the records, Finnell restricted his analysis to the  period from August 2, 2001 to August 15, 2001.      Finnell calculated an overblocking rate for each of the  three libraries by examining the host Web site containing each of  the blocked pages.  He did not employ a sampling technique, but  instead examined each blocked Web site.  If the contents of a  host Web site or the pages within the Web site were consistent  with the filtering product's definition of the category under  which the site was blocked, Finnell considered it to be an  accurate block.  Finnell and three others, two of whom were  temporary employees, examined the Web sites to determine whether  they were consistent with the filtering companies' category  definitions.  Their review was, of course, necessarily limited  by: (1) the clarity of the filtering companies' category  definitions; (2) Finnell's and his employees' interpretations of  the definitions; and (3) human error.  The study's reliability is  also undercut by the fact that Finnell failed to archive the  blocked Web pages as they existed either at the point that a  patron in one of the three libraries was denied access or when  Finnell and his team reviewed the pages.  It is therefore  impossible for anyone to check the accuracy and consistency of  Finnell's review team, or to know whether the pages contained the  same content when the block occurred as they did when Finnell's  team reviewed them.  This is a key flaw, because the results of  the study depend on individual determinations as to overblocking  and underblocking, in which Finnell and his team were required to  compare what they saw on the Web pages that they reviewed with  standard definitions provided by the filtering company.      Tacoma library's Cyber Patrol software blocked 836 unique  Web sites during the month of August.  Finnell determined that  783 of those blocks were accurate and that 53 were inaccurate.   The error rate for Cyber Patrol was therefore estimated to be  6.34%, and the true error rate was estimated with 95% confidence  to lie within the range of 4.69% to 7.99%.   Finnell and his  team reviewed 185 unique Web sites that were blocked by  Westerville Library's Websense filter during the logged period  and determined that 158 of them were accurate and that 27 of them  were inaccurate.  He therefore estimated the Websense filter's  overblocking rate at 14.59% with a 95% confidence interval of  9.51% to 19.68%.  Additionally, Finnell examined 1,674 unique Web  sites that were blocked by the Greenville Library's N2H2 filter  during the relevant period and determined that 1,520 were  accurate and that 87 were inaccurate.  This yields an estimated  overblocking rate of 5.41% and a 95% confidence interval of 4.33%  to 6.55%.  Finnell's methodology was materially flawed in that it  understates the rate of overblocking for the following reasons.  First, patrons from the three libraries knew that the filters  were operating, and may have been deterred from attempting to  access Web sites that they perceived to be \"borderline\" sites,  i.e., those that may or may not have been appropriately filtered  according to the filtering companies' category definitions.  Second, in their cross-examination of Finnell, the plaintiffs  offered screen shots of a number of Web sites that, according to  Finnell, had been appropriately blocked, but that Finnell  admitted contained only benign materials.  Finnell's explanation  was that the Web sites must have changed between the time when he  conducted the study and the time of the trial, but because he did  not archive the images as they existed when his team reviewed  them for the study, there is no way to verify this.  Third,  because of the way in which Finnell counted blocked Web sites   i.e., if separate patrons attempted to reach the same Web site,  or one or more patrons attempted to access more than one page on  a single Web site, Finnell counted these attempts as a single  block, see supra note 10  his results necessarily understate the  number of times that patrons were erroneously denied access to  information.      At all events, there is no doubt that Finnell's estimated  rates of overblocking, which are based on the filtering  companies' own category definitions, significantly understate the  rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA's category definitions  for filtering for adults.  The filters used in the Tacoma,  Westerville, and Greenville libraries were configured to block,  among other things, images of full nudity and sexually explicit  materials.  There is no dispute, however, that these categories  are far broader than CIPA's categories of visual depictions that  are obscene, or child pornography, the two categories of material  that libraries subject to CIPA must certify that they filter  during adults' use of the Internet.  Finnell's study also calculated underblocking rates with  respect to the Westerville and Greenville Libraries (both of  which logged not only their blocked sites, but all sites visited  by their patrons), by taking random samples of URLs from the list  of sites that were not blocked.  The study used a sample of 159  sites that were accessed by Westerville patrons and determined  that only one of them should have been blocked under the  software's category definitions, yielding an underblocking rate  of 0.6%.  Given the size of the sample, the 95% confidence  interval is 0% to 1.86%.  The study examined a sample of 254 Web  sites accessed by patrons in Greenville and found that three of  them should have been blocked under the filtering software's  category definitions.  This results in an estimated underblocking  rate of 1.2% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0% to  2.51%.      We do not credit Finnell's estimates of the rates of  underblocking in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries  for several reasons.  First, Finnell's estimates likely  understate the actual rate of underblocking because patrons, who  knew that filtering programs were operating in the Greenville and  Westerville Libraries, may have refrained from attempting to  access sites with sexually explicit materials, or other contents  that they knew would probably meet a filtering program's blocked  categories.  Second, and most importantly, we think that the  formula that Finnell used to calculate the rate of underblocking  in these two libraries is not as meaningful as the formula that  information scientists typically use to calculate a rate of  recall, which we describe above in Subsection II.E.3.  As Dr.  Nunberg explained, the standard method that information  scientists use to calculate a rate of recall is to sort a set of  items into two groups, those that fall into a particular category  (e.g., those that should have been blocked by a filter) and those  that do not.  The rate of recall is then calculated by dividing  the number of items that the system correctly identified as  belonging to the category by the total number of items in the  category.      In the example above, we discussed a database that contained  1000 photographs.  Assume that 200 of these photographs were  pictures of dogs.  If, for example, a classification system  designed to identify pictures of dogs identified 80 of the dog  pictures and failed to identify 120, it would have performed with  a recall rate of 40%.  This would be analogous to a filter that  underblocked at a rate of 60%.  To calculate the recall rate of  the filters in the Westerville and Greenville public libraries in  accordance with the standard method described above, Finnell  should have taken a sample of sites from the libraries' Internet  use logs (including both sites that were blocked and sites that  were not), and divided the number of sites in the sample that the  filter incorrectly failed to block by the total number of sites  in the sample that should have been blocked.  What Finnell did  instead was to take a sample of sites that were not blocked, and  divide the total number of sites in this sample by the number of  sites in the sample that should have been blocked.  This made the  denominator that Finnell used much larger than it would have been  had he used the standard method for calculating recall,  consequently making the underblocking rate that he calculated  much lower than it would have been under the standard method.      Moreover, despite the relatively low rates of underblocking  that Finnell's study found, librarians from several of the  libraries proffered by defendants that use blocking products,  including Greenville, Tacoma, and Westerville, testified that  there are instances of underblocking in their libraries.  No  quantitative evidence was presented comparing the effectiveness  of filters and"]]]
