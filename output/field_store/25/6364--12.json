The sanctified tradition that a detective was an agile person with a  variety of side-whiskers no longer obtains even in light literature, and  the most imaginative of us is frankly aware of the fact that a detective  is just a common man earning (or pretending to earn) a common living by  common and obvious means. Yet in spite of ourselves we are accustomed  to attribute superhuman acuteness and a lightning-like rapidity of  intellect to this vague and romantic class of fellow-citizens. The  ordinary work of a detective, however, requires neither of these  qualities. Honesty and obedience are his chief requirements, and if he  have intelligence as well, so much the better, provided it be of the  variety known as \"horse\" sense. A genuine candidate for the job of  Sherlock Holmes would find little competition. In the first place, the  usual work of a detective does not demand any extraordinary powers of  deduction at all.    Leaving out of consideration those who are merely private policemen  (often in uniform), and principally engaged in patrolling residential  streets, preserving order at fairs, race-tracks, and political meetings,  or in breaking strikes and preventing riots, the largest part of the  work for which detectives are employed is not in the detection of  crime and criminals, but in simply watching people, following them, and  reporting as accurately as possible their movements. These functions are  known in the vernacular as spotting, locating, and trailing. It  requires patience, some powers of observation, and occasionally a little  ingenuity. The real detective under such circumstances is the man to  whom they hand in their reports. Yet much of the most dramatic and  valuable work that is done involves no acuteness at all, but simply a  willingness to act as a spy and to brave the dangers of being found out.    There is nothing more thrilling in the pages of modern history than the  story of the man (James McPartland) who uncovered the conspiracies of  the Molly McGuires. But the work of this man was that of a spy pure and  simple.    Another highly specialized class of detectives is that engaged in police  and banking work, who by experience (or even origin) have a wide and  intimate acquaintance with criminals of various sorts, and by their  familiarity with the latters' whereabouts, associates, work, and methods  are able to recognize and run down the perpetrators of particular  crimes.    Thus, for example, there are men in the detective bureau of New York  City who know by name, and perhaps have a speaking acquaintance with,  a large number of the pick-pockets and burglars of the East Side. They  know their haunts and their ties of friendship or marriage. When any  particular job is pulled off they have a pretty shrewd idea of who is  responsible for it and lay their plans accordingly. If necessary,  they run in the whole gang and put each of them through a course of  interrogation, accusation, and browbeating until some one breaks down  or makes a slip that involves him in a tangle. These men are special  policemen whose knowledge makes them detectives by courtesy. But  their work does not involve any particular superiority or quickness of  intellect--the quality which we are wont to associate with the detection  of crime.    Now, if the ordinary householder finds that his wife's necklace has  mysteriously disappeared, his first impulse is to send for a detective  of some sort or other. In general, he might just as well send for his  mother-in-law. Of course, the police can and will watch the pawnshops  for the missing baubles, but no crook who is not a fool is going to  pawn a whole necklace on the Bowery the very next day after it has been  \"lifted.\" Or he can enlist a private detective who will question the  servants and perhaps go through their trunks, if they will let him.  Either sort will probably line up the inmates of the house for general  scrutiny and try to bully them separately into a confession. This may  save the master a disagreeable experience, but it is the simplest sort  of police work and is done vicariously for the taxpayer, just as the  public garbage man relieves you from the burden of taking out the  ashes yourself, because he is paid for it, not on account of your own  incapacity or his superiority.    The real detective is the one who, taking up the solution of a crime or  other mystery, brings to bear upon it unusual powers of observation  and deduction and an exceptional resourcefulness in acting upon his  conclusions. Frankly, I have known very few such, although for some ten  years I have made use of a large number of so-called detectives in both  public and private matters. As I recall the long line of cases where  these men have rendered service of great value, almost every one  resolves itself into a successful piece of mere spying or trailing.  Little ingenuity or powers of reason were required. Of course, there  are a thousand tricks that an experienced man acquires as a matter of  course, but which at first sight seem almost like inspiration. I shall  not forget my delight when Jesse Blocher, who had been trailing Charles  Foster Dodge through the South (when the latter was wanted as the chief  witness against Abe Hummel on the charge of subornation of perjury of  which he was finally convicted), told me how he instantly located his  man, without disclosing his own identity, by unostentatiously leaving a  note addressed to Dodge in a bright-red envelope upon the office counter  of the Hotel St. Charles in New Orleans, where he knew his quarry to be  staying. A few moments later the clerk saw it, picked it up, and, as  a matter of course, thrust it promptly into box No. 420, thus  involuntarily hanging, as it were, a red lantern on Dodge's door.    There is no more reason to look for superiority of intelligence or  mental alertness among detectives of the ordinary class than there is to  expect it from clerks, stationary engineers, plumbers, or firemen. While  comparisons are invidious, I should be inclined to say that the ordinary  chauffeur was probably a brighter man than the average detective. This  is not to be taken in derogation of the latter, but as a compliment to  the former. There are a great many detectives of ambiguous training. I  remember in one case discovering that of the more important detectives  employed by a well-known private Anti-Criminal Society in New York, one  had been a street vender of frankfurters (otherwise yclept \"hot dogs\"),  and another the keeper of a bird store, which last perhaps qualified him  for the pursuit and capture of human game. There is a popular fiction  that lawyers are shrewd and capable, similar to the prevailing one  that detectives are astute and cunning. But, as the head of one of  the biggest agencies in the country remarked to me the other day, when  discussing the desirability of retaining local counsel in a distant  city: \"You know how hard it is to find a lawyer that isn't a dead one.\"  I feel confident that he did not mean this in the sense that there was  no good lawyer except a dead lawyer. What my detective friend probably  had in mind was that it was difficult to find a lawyer who brought to  bear on a new problem any originality of thought or action. It is even  harder to find a detective who is not in this sense a dead one. I have  the feeling, being a lawyer myself, that it is harder to find a live  detective than a live lawyer. There are a few of both, however, if you  know where to look for them. But it is easy to fall into the hands of  the Philistines.    The fundamental reason why it is so hard to form any just opinion of  detectives in general is that (except by their fruits) there is little  opportunity to discriminate between the able and the incapable. Now, the  more difficult and complicated his task the less likely is the sleuth  (honest or otherwise) to succeed. The chances are a good deal more than  even that he will never solve the mystery for which he is engaged.  Thus at the end of three months you will have only his reports and his  bill--which are poor comfort, to say the least. And yet he may have  really worked eighteen hours a day in your service. But a dishonest  detective has only to disappear (and take his ease for the same period)  and send you his reports and his bill--and you will have only his word  for how much work he has done and how much money he has spent. You are  absolutely in his power--unless you hire another detective to watch  HIM. Consequently there is no class in the world where the temptation to  dishonesty is greater than among detectives. This, too, is, I fancy,  the reason that the evidence of the police detective is received with so  much suspicion by jurymen--they know that the only way for him to retain  his position is by making a record and getting convictions, and hence  they are always looking for jobs and frame-ups. If a police detective  doesn't make arrests and send a man to jail every once in a while there  is no conclusive way for his superiors to be sure he isn't loafing.    There are a very large number of persons who go into the detective  business for the same reason that others enter the ministry--they can't  make a living at anything else, Provided he has squint eyes and a dark"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#13)"],[1,"    [Footnote 148: Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 37.]    THE PLAGIARISM CLINCHED.    Thus far we have established in a general way the existence and nature  of Solomon Spaulding's rewritten \"Manuscript Found.\" By undenied  evidence we have shown its theft from Patterson's printing office  before Spaulding's death and under circumstances which made the latter  suspect Sidney Rigdon as the thief; that Rigdon, prior to this time,  was so intimate with the employees of that printing office as to give  rise to a general belief that he was himself employed there, and beyond  all question evidencing an intimacy such as afforded him opportunity  to purloin the manuscript. By like uncontradicted evidence, we have  shown Rigdon to have been in possession of a similar manuscript,  the existence of which is not explained by any other literary work  ever done by him, and which, on one of the several occasions when he  exhibited it, was said by him to have been written by Spaulding. We  have established a perfectly plain and probable connection between  Smith and Rigdon through Parley P. Pratt, and such contradictory  statements as to the sudden and miraculous conversions of the two  latter as bring home with redoubled force the suspicion of a concealed  motive, such as a conspiracy in fraud would best explain. It now  remains only to make more certain the points of identity between  Spaulding's rewritten \"Manuscript Found\" and the Book of Mormon. When  this is done we will have established the plagiarism and convicted  Smith, Rigdon, and Pratt as the conspirators who perpetrated the fraud.  With the identity of the distinguishing features in the \"Manuscript  Found\" and Book of Mormon established, we will have demonstrated beyond  all _reasonable_ doubt the very low origin of the Mormons' Book.  Some day will be done a work of supererogation in making a critical  examination of the absurdities and contradictions upon which rest the  claim of divinity. Present space will only allow the completion of that  branch of the argument under consideration.    Before proceeding to the examination of the direct evidence, it will  be well to give an account of the discovery of this identity, the very  spontaneity of which adds force to the evidence adduced. Spaulding,  like most authors, had a great fondness for his productions, and often  read them to his friends. In 1832 or 1833, when Mormonism was fairly  afloat, a Mormon preacher brought a copy of the Book of Mormon to  Conneaut or New Salem, as it was sometimes called, the very place where  Spaulding wrote most of his \"Manuscript Found.\" A public meeting was  appointed, in which the Book of Mormon was copiously read from and  discussed by the elder. The historical part and style were immediately  recognized by many present, among them John Spaulding, brother to  Solomon Spaulding. Being \"eminently pious,\" he was amazed and afflicted  that his brother's manuscript should have been perverted to so wicked  a purpose. With tear-filled eyes he arose in the meeting and expressed  sorrow and regret that the writings of his sainted brother should  be used for a purpose so vile and shocking. So much excitement was  produced that a citizens' meeting appointed Dr. Philastus Hurlburt to  gather the evidence which afterwards was published in Howe's \"Mormonism  Unveiled.\" [149]    [Footnote 149: \"Gleanings by the Way,\" 252-3. \"Mormons' Own Book,\"  29-30. \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 417. _et. seq._ Boston _Recorder,_ May,  1839.]    In the first publication of Matilda Spaulding Davidson's letter,  from which the above is gleaned, the words \"Mormon preacher\" in the  manuscript published over her name were, by the typesetter, converted  into \"woman preacher.\" Mormons at once undertook to impeach the  statement, not by denying the main features of the story of its value  as an argument, but wholly upon the ground that Mormons never had a  \"woman\" preacher. As the result of this criticism, it was shown to have  been due solely to typographical error, [150] thus leaving the statement  as corrected free from criticism upon this ground. The very spontaneity  of this outburst and its surrounding circumstances absolutely preclude  every imputation of premeditation, every suspicion of personal  interest, and every impeachment based upon an assumed hatred of  Mormonism. Further, when we in addition remember that this occurrence  was comparatively close to the time when Spaulding read his manuscript  to many of those present in this same audience, then this circumstance  will rightfully be accorded a very great evidentiary weight.    [Footnote 150: \"Gleanings by the Way,\" 264.]    The evidence gathered by Dr. Philastus Hurlburt pursuant to the  citizens' meeting of Conneaut was first published in Howe's \"Mormonism  Unveiled,\" in 1834, and is the most important single collection of  original evidence ever made upon this subject. We will first examine  that evidence in so far as it relates to the identity of Spaulding's  \"Manuscript Found\" and the Book of Mormon, afterwards introducing such  corroborating evidence as may be at hand. Unless otherwise indicated,  the following evidence was taken before and published in 1834 by E. D.  Howe in the nineteenth chapter of his \"Mormonism Unveiled.\" The first  witness introduced is John Spaulding who lived with his brother Solomon  at Conneaut, O. Of a book his brother had been writing John Spaulding  says this:        \"The book he was writing was entitled 'Manuscript Found,' of which      he read to me many passages. It was an historical romance of the      first settlers of America, endeavoring to show that the American      Indians are the descendants of the Jew, or the lost tribes. It      gave a detailed account of their journey from Jerusalem by land      and sea till they arrived in America under the command of _Nephi_      and _Lehi._ They afterwards had quarrels and contentions and      separated into two distinct nations, one of which he denominated      _Nephites_ and the other _Lamanites._ Cruel and bloody wars ensued,      in which great multitudes were slain. They buried their dead in      large heaps, which caused the mounds so common in this country. The      arts, sciences and civilization were brought into view in order to      account for all the curious antiquities found in various parts of      North and South America. I have recently read the Book of Mormon,      and, to my great surprise, I find _nearly all the same historical      matter, names, etc.,_ as they were in my brother's writings. I      well remember that he wrote in the old style and commenced about      every sentence with 'And it came to pass,' or 'Now it came to      pass,' the _same as in the Book of Mormon,_ and, according to my      best recollection and belief, it is the same as my brother Solomon      wrote, with the exception of the religious matter. By what means      it has fallen into the hands of Joseph Smith, Jr., I am unable to      determine.        \"JOHN SPAULDING.\"    Our next witness is Martha Spaulding, wife of John Spaulding. She says:        \"I was personally acquainted with Solomon Spaulding about twenty      years ago. I was at his house a short time before he left Conneaut;      he was then writing a historical novel, founded upon the first      settlers of America. He represented them as an enlightened and      warlike people. He had for many years contended that the aborigines      of America were the descendants of some of the lost tribes of      Israel, and this idea he carried out in the book in question. The      lapse of time which has intervened prevents my recollecting but few      of the leading incidents of his writings; but the names of _Nephi_      and _Lehi_ are yet fresh in my memory as being the principal      heroes of his tale. They were officers of the company which first      came off from Jerusalem. He gave a particular account of their      journey by land and sea till they arrived in America, after which      disputes arose between the chiefs which caused them to separate      into different bands, one of which was called Lamanites and the      other Nephites. Between these were recounted tremendous battles,      which frequently covered the ground with the slain; and their      being buried in large heaps was the cause of the numerous mounds      in the country. Some of these people he represented as being very      large. I have read the Book of Mormon, which has brought fresh to      my recollection the writings of Solomon Spaulding, and I have no      manner of doubt that the historical part of it is the same that I      read and heard more than twenty years ago. The old, obsolete style      and the phrases of 'and it came to pass,' etc., are the same.        \"MARTHA SPAULDING\"    Our third witness is Henry Lake, Spaulding's business partner at  Conneaut. He says:        \"He [Spaulding] very frequently read to me from a manuscript      which he was writing, which he entitled the 'Manuscript Found,'      and which he represented as being found in this town. I spent      many hours in hearing him read said writings, and became well      acquainted with its contents. He wished me to assist him in getting      his production printed, alleging that a book of that kind would      meet with a rapid sale. I designed doing so, but the forge not      meeting our anticipations, we failed in business, when I declined      having anything to do with the publication of the book. This      book represented the American Indians as the descendants of the      lost tribes, gave an account of their leaving Jerusalem, their      contentions and wars, which were many and great. One time, when he      was reading to me the tragic account of Laban, I pointed out to him      what I considered an inconsistency, which he promised to correct,      but by referring to the Book of Mormon I find, to my surprise, that      it stands there just as he read it to me"]]]
