For dress the insect wore a dark-blue swallowtail coat with a yellow silk  lining and a flower in the button-hole; a vest of white duck that stretched        145  tightly across the wide body; knickerbockers of fawn-colored plush, fastened  at the knees with gilt buckles; and, perched upon its small head, was  jauntily set a tall silk hat.    Standing upright before our amazed friends the Woggle-Bug appeared to be  fully as tall as the Tin Woodman; and surely no bug in all the Land of Oz  had ever before attained so enormous a size.    \"I confess,\" said the Scarecrow, \"that your abrupt appearance has caused me  surprise, and no doubt has startled my companions. I hope, however, that  this circumstance will not distress you. We shall probably get used to you  in time.\"    \"Do not apologize, I beg of you!\" returned the Woggle-Bug, earnestly. \"It  affords me great pleasure to surprise people; for surely I cannot be classed  with ordinary insects and am entitled to both curiosity and admiration from  those I meet.\"    \"You are, indeed,\" agreed his Majesty.    \"If you will permit me to seat myself in your august company,\" continued the  stranger, \"I will gladly relate my history, so that you will be better able  to comprehend my unusual--may I say remarkable?--appearance.\"    \"You may say what you please,\" answered the Tin Woodman, briefly.        146    So the Woggle-Bug sat down upon the grass, facing the little group of  wanderers, and told them the following story:                   Line-Art Drawing        147               A Highly Magnified History      \"It is but honest that I should acknowledge at the beginning of my recital  that I was born an ordinary Woggle-Bug,\" began the creature, in a frank and  friendly tone. \"Knowing no better, I used my arms as well as my legs for  walking, and crawled under the edges of stones or hid among the roots of  grasses with no thought beyond finding a few insects smaller than myself to  feed upon.    \"The chill nights rendered me stiff and motionless, for I wore no clothing,  but each morning the warm rays of the sun gave me new life and restored me  to activity. A horrible existence is this, but you must remember it is the  regular ordained existence of Woggle-Bugs, as well as of many other tiny  creatures that inhabit the earth.    \"But Destiny had singled me out, humble though I was, for a grander fate!  One day I crawled near        148  to a country school house, and my curiosity being excited by the monotonous  hum of the students within, I made bold to enter and creep along a crack  between two boards until I reached the far end, where, in front of a hearth  of glowing embers, sat the master at his desk.    \"No one noticed so small a creature as a Woggle-Bug, and when I found that  the hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine, I  resolved to establish my future home beside it. So I found a charming nest  between two bricks and hid myself therein for many, many months.    \"Professor Nowitall is, doubtless, the most famous scholar in the land of  Oz, and after a few days I began to listen to the lectures and discourses he  gave his pupils. Not one of them was more attentive than the humble,  unnoticed Woggle-Bug, and I acquired in this way a fund of knowledge that I  will myself confess is simply marvelous. That is why I place 'T.E.'  Thoroughly Educated upon my cards; for my greatest pride lies in the fact  that the world cannot produce another Woggle-Bug with a tenth part of my own  culture and erudition.\"    \"I do not blame you,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Education is a thing to be proud  of. I'm educated myself. The mess of brains given me by the Great        149  Wizard is considered by my friends to be unexcelled.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" interrupted the Tin Woodman, \"a good heart is, I believe,  much more desirable than education or brains.\"    \"To me,\" said the Saw-Horse, \"a good leg is more desirable than either.\"    \"Could seeds be considered in the light of brains?\" enquired the  Pumpkinhead, abruptly.    \"Keep quiet!\" commanded Tip, sternly.    \"Very well, dear father,\" answered the obedient Jack.    The Woggle-Bug listened patiently--even respectfully--to these remarks,  and then resumed his story.    \"I must have lived fully three years in that secluded school-house hearth,\"  said he, \"drinking thirstily of the ever-flowing fount of limpid knowledge  before me.\"    \"Quite poetical,\" commented the Scarecrow, nodding his head approvingly.    \"But one, day\" continued the Bug, \"a marvelous circumstance occurred that  altered my very existence and brought me to my present pinnacle of  greatness. The                   Line-Art Drawing        150  Professor discovered me in the act of crawling across the hearth, and before  I could escape he had caught me between his thumb and forefinger.    \"'My dear children,' said he, 'I have captured a Woggle-Bug--a very rare  and interesting specimen. Do any of you know what a Woggle-Bug is?'    \"'No!' yelled the scholars, in chorus.    \"'Then,' said the Professor, 'I will get out my famous magnifying-glass and  throw the insect upon a screen in a highly-magnified condition, that you may  all study carefully its peculiar construction and become acquainted with its  habits and manner of life.'    \"He then brought from a cupboard a most curious instrument, and before I  could realize what had happened I found myself thrown upon a screen in a  highly-magnified state--even as you now behold me.    \"The students stood up on their stools and craned their heads forward to get  a better view of me, and two little girls jumped upon the sill of an open  window where they could see more plainly.    \"'Behold!' cried the Professor, in a loud voice, 'this highly-magnified  Woggle-Bug; one of the most curious insects in existence!'    \"Being Thoroughly Educated, and knowing what is required of a cultured  gentleman, at this juncture I stood upright and, placing my hand upon my        151               Full page line-art drawing.                   \"THEE STUDENTS STOOD UP ON THEIR STOOLS.\"        152  bosom, made a very polite bow. My action, being unexpected, must have  startled them, for one of the little girls perched upon the window-sill gave  a scream and fell backward out the window, drawing her companion with her as  she disappeared.    \"The Professor uttered a cry of horror and rushed away through the door to  see if the poor children were injured by the fall. The scholars followed  after him in a wild mob, and I was left alone in the school-room, still in a  Highly-Magnified state and free to do as I pleased.    \"It immediately occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to escape. I  was proud of my great size, and realized that now I could safely travel  anywhere in the world, while my superior culture would make me a fit  associate for the most learned person I might chance to meet.    \"So, while the Professor picked the little girls--who were more frightened  than hurt--off the ground, and the pupils clustered around him closely  grouped, I calmly walked out of the school-house, turned a corner, and  escaped unnoticed to a grove of trees that stood near\"    \"Wonderful!\" exclaimed the Pumpkinhead, admiringly.    \"It was, indeed,\" agreed the Woggle-Bug. \"I        153  have never ceased to congratulate myself for escaping while I was Highly  Magnified; for even my excess-                     Line-Art Drawing      ive knowledge would have proved of little use to me had I remained a tiny,  insignificant insect.\"    \"I didn't know before,\" said Tip, looking at the        154  Woggle-Bug with a puzzled expression, \"that insects wore clothes.\"    \"Nor do they, in their natural state,\" returned the stranger. \"But in the  course of my wanderings I had the good fortune to save the ninth life of a  tailor--tailors having, like cats, nine lives, as you probably know. The  fellow was exceedingly grateful, for had he lost that ninth life it would  have been the end of him; so he begged permission to furnish me with the  stylish costume I now wear. It fits very nicely, does it not?\" and the  Woggle-Bug stood up and turned himself around slowly, that all might examine  his person.    \"He must have been a good tailor,\" said the Scarecrow, somewhat enviously.    \"He was a good-hearted tailor, at any rate,\" observed Nick Chopper.    \"But where were you going, when you met us?\" Tip asked the Woggle-Bug.    \"Nowhere in particular,\" was the reply, \"although it is my intention soon to  visit the Emerald City and arrange to give a course of lectures to select  audiences on the 'Advantages of Magnification.'\"    \"We are bound for the Emerald City now,\" said the Tin Woodman; \"so, if it  pleases you to do so, you are welcome to travel in our company.\"        155    The Woggle-Bug bowed with profound grace.    \"It will give me great pleasure,\" said he \"to accept your kind invitation;  for nowhere in the Land of Oz could I hope to meet with so congenial a  company.\"    \"That is true,\" acknowledged the Pumpkinhead. \"We are quite as congenial as  flies and honey.\"    \"But--pardon me if I seem inquisitive--are you not all rather--ahem!  rather unusual?\" asked the Woggle-Bug, looking from one to another with  unconcealed interest.    \"Not more so than yourself,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"Everything in life is  unusual until you get accustomed to it.\"    \"What rare philosophy!\" exclaimed the Woggle-Bug, admiringly.    \"Yes; my brains are working well today,\" admitted the Scarecrow, an accent  of pride in his voice.    \"Then, if you are sufficiently rested and refreshed, let us bend our steps  toward the Emerald City,\" suggested the magnified one.    \"We can't,\" said Tip. \"The Saw-Horse has broken a leg, so he can't bend his  steps.
