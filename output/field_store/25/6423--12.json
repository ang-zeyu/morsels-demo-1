At present there is and can be very little system or regularity  about me. About half of my time I am scarcely alive, and a great part  of the rest the slave and sport of morbid feeling and unreasonable  prejudice. I have everything but good health.    \"I still rejoice that this letter will find you in good old  Connecticut--thrice blessed--'oh, had I the wings of a dove' I would be  there too. Give my love to Mary H. I remember well how gently she used  to speak to and smile on that forlorn old daddy that boarded at your  house one summer. It was associating with her that first put into my  head the idea of saying something to people who were not agreeable, and  of saying something when I had nothing to say, as is generally the case  on such occasions.\"    Again she writes to the same friend: \"Your letter, my dear G., I have  just received, and read through three times. Now for my meditations  upon it. What a woman of the world you are grown. How good it would be  for me to be put into a place which so breaks up and precludes thought.  Thought, intense emotional thought, has been my disease. How much good  it might do me to be where I could not but be thoughtless....    \"Now, Georgiana, let me copy for your delectation a list of matters  that I have jotted down for consideration at a teachers' meeting to be  held to-morrow night. It runneth as follows. Just hear! 'About quills  and paper on the floor; forming classes; drinking in the entry (cold  water, mind you); giving leave to speak; recess-bell, etc., etc.' 'You  are tired, I see,' says Gilpin, 'so am I,' and I spare you.    \"I have just been hearing a class of little girls recite, and telling  them a fairy story which I had to spin out as it went along, beginning  with 'once upon a time there was,' etc., in the good old-fashioned way  of stories.    \"Recently I have been reading the life of Madame de Stael and  'Corinne.' I have felt an intense sympathy with many parts of that  book, with many parts of her character. But in America feelings  vehement and absorbing like hers become still more deep, morbid, and  impassioned by the constant habits of self-government which the rigid  forms of our society demand. They are repressed, and they burn inward  till they burn the very soul, leaving only dust and ashes. It seems  to me the intensity with which my mind has thought and felt on every  subject presented to it has had this effect. It has withered and  exhausted it, and though young I have no sympathy with the feelings of  youth. All that is enthusiastic, all that is impassioned in admiration  of nature, of writing, of character, in devotional thought and  emotion, or in the emotions of affection, I have felt with vehement  and absorbing intensity,--felt till my mind is exhausted, and seems  to be sinking into deadness. Half of my time I am glad to remain in a  listless vacancy, to busy myself with trifles, since thought is pain,  and emotion is pain.\"    During the winter of 1833-34 the young school-teacher became so  distressed at her own mental listlessness that she made a vigorous  effort to throw it off. She forced herself to mingle in society, and,  stimulated by the offer of a prize of fifty dollars by Mr. James Hall,  editor of the \"Western Monthly,\" a newly established magazine, for the  best short story, she entered into the competition. Her story, which  was entitled \"Uncle Lot,\" afterwards republished in the \"Mayflower,\"  was by far the best submitted, and was awarded the prize without  hesitation. This success gave a new direction to her thoughts, gave her  an insight into her own ability, and so encouraged her that from that  time on she devoted most of her leisure moments to writing.    Her literary efforts were further stimulated at this time by the  congenial society of the Semi-Colon Club, a little social circle that  met on alternate weeks at Mr. Samuel Foote's and Dr. Drake's. The name  of the club originated with a roundabout and rather weak bit of logic  set forth by one of its promoters. He said: \"You know that in Spanish  Columbus is called 'Colon.' Now he who discovers a new pleasure is  certainly half as great as he who discovers a new continent. Therefore  if Colon discovered a continent, we who have discovered in this club a  new pleasure should at least be entitled to the name of 'Semi-Colons.'\"  So Semi-Colons they became and remained for some years.    At some meetings compositions were read, and at others nothing  was read, but the time was passed in a general discussion of some  interesting topic previously announced. Among the members of the club  were Professor Stowe, unsurpassed in Biblical learning; Judge James  Hall, editor of the \"Western Monthly;\" General Edward King; Mrs.  Peters, afterwards founder of the Philadelphia School of Design; Miss  Catherine Beecher; Mrs. Caroline Lee Hentz; E. P. Cranch; Dr. Drake;  S. P. Chase, and many others who afterwards became prominent in their  several walks of life.    In one of her letters to Miss May, Mrs. Stowe describes one of her  methods for entertaining the members of the Semi-Colon as follows:--    \"I am wondering as to what I shall do next. I have been writing a  piece to be read next Monday evening at Uncle Sam's _soiree_ (the  Semi-Colon). It is a letter purporting to be from Dr. Johnson. I have  been stilting about in his style so long that it is a relief to me to  come down to the jog of common English. Now I think of it I will just  give you a history of my campaign in this circle.    \"My first piece was a letter from Bishop Butler, written in his  outrageous style of parentheses and foggification. My second a  satirical essay on the modern uses of languages. This I shall send  to you, as some of the gentlemen, it seems, took a fancy to it and  requested leave to put it in the 'Western Magazine,' and so it is in  print. It is ascribed to _Catherine_, or I don't know that I should  have let it go. I have no notion of appearing in _propria personae_.    \"The next piece was a satire on certain members who were getting very  much into the way of joking on the worn-out subjects of matrimony and  old maid and old bachelorism. I therefore wrote a set of legislative  enactments purporting to be from the ladies of the society, forbidding  all such allusions in future. It made some sport at the time. I try not  to be personal, and to be courteous, even in satire.    \"But I have written a piece this week that is making me some disquiet.  I did not like it that there was so little that was serious and  rational about the reading. So I conceived the design of writing a _set  of letters_, and throwing them in, as being the letters of a friend.  I wrote a letter this week for the first of the set,--easy, not very  sprightly,--describing an imaginary situation, a house in the country,  a gentleman and lady, Mr. and Mrs. Howard, as being pious, literary,  and agreeable. I threw into the letter a number of little particulars  and incidental allusions to give it the air of having been really a  letter. I meant thus to give myself an opportunity for the introduction  of different subjects and the discussion of different characters in  future letters.    \"I meant to write on a great number of subjects in future. Cousin  Elisabeth, only, was in the secret; Uncle Samuel and Sarah Elliot were  not to know.    \"Yesterday morning I finished my letter, smoked it to make it look  yellow, tore it to make it look old, directed it and scratched out the  direction, postmarked it with red ink, sealed it and broke the seal,  all this to give credibility to the fact of its being a real letter.  Then I inclosed it in an envelope, stating that it was a part of a  _set_ which had incidentally fallen into my hands. This envelope was  written in a scrawny, scrawly, gentleman's hand.    \"I put it into the office in the morning, directed to 'Mrs. Samuel E.  Foote,' and then sent word to Sis that it was coming, so that she  might be ready to enact the part.    \"Well, the deception took. Uncle Sam examined it and pronounced, _ex  cathedra_, that it must have been a real letter. Mr. Greene (the  gentleman who reads) declared that it must have come from Mrs. Hall,  and elucidated the theory by spelling out the names and dates which  I had erased, which, of course, he accommodated to his own tastes.  But then, what makes me feel uneasy is that Elisabeth, after reading  it, did not seem to be exactly satisfied. She thought it had too much  sentiment, too much particularity of incident,--she did not exactly  know what. She was afraid that it would be criticised unmercifully.  Now Elisabeth has a tact and quickness of perception that I trust  to, and her remarks have made me uneasy enough. I am unused to being  criticised, and don't know how I shall bear it.\"    In 1833 Mrs. Stowe first had the subject of slavery brought to her  personal notice by taking a trip across the river from Cincinnati into  Kentucky in company with Miss Dutton, one of the associate teachers in  the Western Institute. They visited an estate that afterwards figured  as that of Colonel Shelby in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" and here the young  authoress first came into personal contact with the negro slaves of  the South. In speaking, many years afterwards, of this visit, Miss  Dutton said: \"Harriet did not seem to notice anything in particular  that happened, but sat much of the time as though abstracted in  thought. When the negroes did funny things and cut up capers, she did  not seem to pay the slightest attention to them. Afterwards, however,  in reading 'Uncle Tom.' I recognized scene after scene of that visit  portrayed with the most minute fidelity, and knew at once where the  material for that portion of the story had been gathered.\"    At this time, however, Mrs. Stowe was more deeply interested in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6753"],[0,"Psmith in the City (#13)"],[1,"buffoonery, Mr Smith--'    Psmith raised a pained pair of eyebrows.    'Buffoonery, sir!'    'I cannot understand what made you act as you did last night, unless  you are perfectly mad, as I am beginning to think.'    'But, surely, sir, there was nothing remarkable in my behaviour? When a  merchant has attached himself to your collar, can you do less than  smite him on the other cheek? I merely acted in self-defence. You saw  for yourself--'    'You know what I am alluding to. Your behaviour during my speech.'    'An excellent speech,' murmured Psmith courteously.    'Well?' said Mr Bickersdyke.    'It was, perhaps, mistaken zeal on my part, sir, but you must remember  that I acted purely from the best motives. It seemed to me--'    'That is enough, Mr Smith. I confess that I am absolutely at a loss to  understand you--'    'It is too true, sir,' sighed Psmith.    'You seem,' continued Mr Bickersdyke, warming to his subject, and  turning gradually a richer shade of purple, 'you seem to be determined  to endeavour to annoy me.' ('No no,' from Psmith.) 'I can only assume  that you are not in your right senses. You follow me about in my club--'    'Our club, sir,' murmured Psmith.    'Be good enough not to interrupt me, Mr Smith. You dog my footsteps in  my club--'    'Purely accidental, sir. We happen to meet--that is all.'    'You attend meetings at which I am speaking, and behave in a perfectly  imbecile manner.'    Psmith moaned slightly.    'It may seem humorous to you, but I can assure you it is extremely bad  policy on your part. The New Asiatic Bank is no place for humour, and I  think--'    'Excuse me, sir,' said Psmith.    The manager started at the familiar phrase. The plum-colour of his  complexion deepened.    'I entirely agree with you, sir,' said Psmith, 'that this bank is no  place for humour.'    'Very well, then. You--'    'And I am never humorous in it. I arrive punctually in the morning,  and I work steadily and earnestly till my labours are completed. I  think you will find, on inquiry, that Mr Rossiter is satisfied with my  work.'    'That is neither here nor--'    'Surely, sir,' said Psmith, 'you are wrong? Surely your jurisdiction  ceases after office hours? Any little misunderstanding we may have at  the close of the day's work cannot affect you officially. You could  not, for instance, dismiss me from the service of the bank if we were  partners at bridge at the club and I happened to revoke.'    'I can dismiss you, let me tell you, Mr Smith, for studied insolence,  whether in the office or not.'    'I bow to superior knowledge,' said Psmith politely, 'but I confess I  doubt it. And,' he added, 'there is another point. May I continue to  some extent?'    'If you have anything to say, say it.'    Psmith flung one leg over the other, and settled his collar.    'It is perhaps a delicate matter,' he said, 'but it is best to be  frank. We should have no secrets. To put my point quite clearly, I must  go back a little, to the time when you paid us that very welcome  week-end visit at our house in August.'    'If you hope to make capital out of the fact that I have been a guest  of your father--'    'Not at all,' said Psmith deprecatingly. 'Not at all. You do not take  me. My point is this. I do not wish to revive painful memories, but it  cannot be denied that there was, here and there, some slight bickering  between us on that occasion. The fault,' said Psmith magnanimously,  'was possibly mine. I may have been too exacting, too capricious.  Perhaps so. However, the fact remains that you conceived the happy  notion of getting me into this bank, under the impression that, once I  was in, you would be able to--if I may use the expression--give me  beans. You said as much to me, if I remember. I hate to say it, but  don't you think that if you give me the sack, although my work is  satisfactory to the head of my department, you will be by way of  admitting that you bit off rather more than you could chew? I merely  make the suggestion.'    Mr Bickersdyke half rose from his chair.    'You--'    'Just so, just so, but--to return to the main point--don't you? The  whole painful affair reminds me of the story of Agesilaus and the  Petulant Pterodactyl, which as you have never heard, I will now proceed  to relate. Agesilaus--'    Mr Bickersdyke made a curious clucking noise in his throat.    'I am boring you,' said Psmith, with ready tact. 'Suffice it to say  that Comrade Agesilaus interfered with the pterodactyl, which was doing  him no harm; and the intelligent creature, whose motto was \"Nemo me  impune lacessit\", turned and bit him. Bit him good and hard, so that  Agesilaus ever afterwards had a distaste for pterodactyls. His  reluctance to disturb them became quite a byword. The Society papers of  the period frequently commented upon it. Let us draw the parallel.'    Here Mr Bickersdyke, who had been clucking throughout this speech,  essayed to speak; but Psmith hurried on.    'You are Agesilaus,' he said. 'I am the Petulant Pterodactyl. You, if I  may say so, butted in of your own free will, and took me from a happy  home, simply in order that you might get me into this place under you,  and give me beans. But, curiously enough, the major portion of that  vegetable seems to be coming to you. Of course, you can administer the  push if you like; but, as I say, it will be by way of a confession that  your scheme has sprung a leak. Personally,' said Psmith, as one friend  to another, 'I should advise you to stick it out. You never know what  may happen. At any moment I may fall from my present high standard of  industry and excellence; and then you have me, so to speak, where the  hair is crisp.'    He paused. Mr Bickersdyke's eyes, which even in their normal state  protruded slightly, now looked as if they might fall out at any moment.  His face had passed from the plum-coloured stage to something beyond.  Every now and then he made the clucking noise, but except for that he  was silent. Psmith, having waited for some time for something in the  shape of comment or criticism on his remarks, now rose.    'It has been a great treat to me, this little chat,' he said affably,  'but I fear that I must no longer allow purely social enjoyments to  interfere with my commercial pursuits. With your permission, I will  rejoin my department, where my absence is doubtless already causing  comment and possibly dismay. But we shall be meeting at the club  shortly, I hope. Good-bye, sir, good-bye.'    He left the room, and walked dreamily back to the Postage Department,  leaving the manager still staring glassily at nothing.          13. Mike is Moved On      This episode may be said to have concluded the first act of the  commercial drama in which Mike and Psmith had been cast for leading  parts. And, as usually happens after the end of an act, there was a  lull for a while until things began to work up towards another climax.  Mike, as day succeeded day, began to grow accustomed to the life of the  bank, and to find that it had its pleasant side after all. Whenever a  number of people are working at the same thing, even though that thing  is not perhaps what they would have chosen as an object in life, if  left to themselves, there is bound to exist an atmosphere of  good-fellowship; something akin to, though a hundred times weaker  than, the public school spirit. Such a community lacks the main motive  of the public school spirit, which is pride in the school and its  achievements. Nobody can be proud of the achievements of a bank. When  the business of arranging a new Japanese loan was given to the New  Asiatic Bank, its employees did not stand on stools, and cheer. On the  contrary, they thought of the extra work it would involve; and they  cursed a good deal, though there was no denying that it was a big thing  for the bank--not unlike winning the Ashburton would be to a school.  There is a cold impersonality about a bank. A school is a living thing.    Setting aside this important difference, there was a good deal of the  public school about the New Asiatic Bank. The heads of departments were  not quite so autocratic as masters, and one was treated more on a  grown-up scale, as man to man; but, nevertheless, there remained a  distinct flavour of a school republic. Most of the men in the bank,  with the exception of certain hard-headed Scotch youths drafted in from  other establishments in the City, were old public school men. Mike  found two Old Wrykinians in the first week. Neither was well known to  him. They had left in his second year in the team. But it was pleasant  to have them about, and to feel that they had been educated at the  right place.    As far as Mike's personal comfort went, the presence of these two  Wrykinians was very much for the good. Both of them knew all about his  cricket, and they spread the news. The New Asiatic Bank, like most  London banks, was keen on sport, and happened to possess a cricket team  which could make a good game with most of the second-rank clubs. The  disappearance to the East of two of the best bats of the previous  season caused Mike's advent to be hailed with a good deal of  enthusiasm. Mike was a county man. He had only played once for his  county, it was true, but that did not matter. He had passed the barrier  which separates the second-class bat from the first-class, and the bank  welcomed him with awe. County men did not come their way every day.    Mike did not like being in the bank, considered in the light of a  career. But he bore no grudge against the inmates of the bank, such as  he had borne against the inmates of Sedleigh. He had looked on the  latter as bound up with the school, and, consequently, enemies. His  fellow workers in the bank he regarded as companions in misfortune.  They were all in the same boat together. There were men from Tonbridge,  Dulwich, Bedford, St Paul's, and a dozen other schools. One or two of  them he knew by"]]]
