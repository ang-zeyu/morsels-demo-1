No one happening to see her, on she ran, unable to think  for fear, and ready to run anywhere to elude the awful creature with  the stilt-legs.  Not daring to look behind her, she rushed straight out  of the gate and up the mountain.  It was foolish indeed--thus to run  farther and farther from all who could help her, as if she had been  seeking a fit spot for the goblin creature to eat her in his leisure;  but that is the way fear serves us: it always sides with the thing we  are afraid of.    The princess was soon out of breath with running uphill; but she ran  on, for she fancied the horrible creature just behind her, forgetting  that, had it been after her such long legs as those must have overtaken  her long ago.  At last she could run no longer, and fell, unable even  to scream, by the roadside, where she lay for some time half dead with  terror.  But finding nothing lay hold of her, and her breath beginning  to come back, she ventured at length to get half up and peer anxiously  about her.  It was now so dark she could see nothing.  Not a single  star was out.  She could not even tell in what direction the house lay,  and between her and home she fancied the dreadful creature lying ready  to pounce upon her. She saw now that she ought to have run up the  stairs at once.  It was well she did not scream; for, although very few  of the goblins had come out for weeks, a stray idler or two might have  heard her. She sat down upon a stone, and nobody but one who had done  something wrong could have been more miserable.  She had quite  forgotten her promise to visit her grandmother.  A raindrop fell on her  face.  She looked up, and for a moment her terror was lost in  astonishment.  At first she thought the rising moon had left her place,  and drawn nigh to see what could be the matter with the little girl,  sitting alone, without hat or cloak, on the dark bare mountain; but she  soon saw she was mistaken, for there was no light on the ground at her  feet, and no shadow anywhere.  But a great silver globe was hanging in  the air; and as she gazed at the lovely thing, her courage revived.  If  she were but indoors again, she would fear nothing, not even the  terrible creature with the long legs!  But how was she to find her way  back?  What could that light be?  Could it be--? No, it couldn't.  But  what if it should be--yes--it must be--her great-great-grandmother's  lamp, which guided her pigeons home through the darkest night!  She  jumped up: she had but to keep that light in view and she must find the  house.  Her heart grew strong.  Speedily, yet softly, she walked down  the hill, hoping to pass the watching creature unseen.  Dark as it was,  there was little danger now of choosing the wrong road.  And--which was  most strange--the light that filled her eyes from the lamp, instead of  blinding them for a moment to the object upon which they next fell,  enabled her for a moment to see it, despite the darkness.  By looking  at the lamp and then dropping her eyes, she could see the road for a  yard or two in front of her, and this saved her from several falls, for  the road was very rough.  But all at once, to her dismay, it vanished,  and the terror of the beast, which had left her the moment she began to  return, again laid hold of her heart.  The same instant, however, she  caught the light of the windows, and knew exactly where she was.  It  was too dark to run, but she made what haste she could, and reached the  gate in safety.  She found the house door still open, ran through the  hall, and, without even looking into the nursery, bounded straight up  the stair, and the next, and the next; then turning to the right, ran  through the long avenue of silent rooms, and found her way at once to  the door at the foot of the tower stair.    When first the nurse missed her, she fancied she was playing her a  trick, and for some time took no trouble about her; but at last,  getting frightened, she had begun to search; and when the princess  entered, the whole household was hither and thither over the house,  hunting for her.  A few seconds after she reached the stair of the  tower they had even begun to search the neglected rooms, in which they  would never have thought of looking had they not already searched every  other place they could think of in vain.  But by this time she was  knocking at the old lady's door.        CHAPTER 15    Woven and Then Spun    'Come in, Irene,' said the silvery voice of her grandmother.    The princess opened the door and peeped in.  But the room was quite  dark and there was no sound of the spinning-wheel.  She grew frightened  once more, thinking that, although the room was there, the old lady  might be a dream after all.  Every little girl knows how dreadful it is  to find a room empty where she thought somebody was; but Irene had to  fancy for a moment that the person she came to find was nowhere at all.  She remembered, however, that at night she spun only in the moonlight,  and concluded that must be why there was no sweet, bee-like humming:  the old lady might be somewhere in the darkness.  Before she had time  to think another thought, she heard her voice again, saying as before:  'Come in, Irene.'  From the sound, she understood at once that she was  not in the room beside her.  Perhaps she was in her bedroom.  She  turned across the passage, feeling her way to the other door.  When her  hand fell on the lock, again the old lady spoke:    'Shut the other door behind you, Irene.  I always close the door of my  workroom when I go to my chamber.'    Irene wondered to hear her voice so plainly through the door: having  shut the other, she opened it and went in.  Oh, what a lovely haven to  reach from the darkness and fear through which she had come!  The soft  light made her feel as if she were going into the heart of the milkiest  pearl; while the blue walls and their silver stars for a moment  perplexed her with the fancy that they were in reality the sky which  she had left outside a minute ago covered with rainclouds.    'I've lighted a fire for you, Irene: you're cold and wet,' said her  grandmother.    Then Irene looked again, and saw that what she had taken for a huge  bouquet of red roses on a low stand against the wall was in fact a fire  which burned in the shapes of the loveliest and reddest roses, glowing  gorgeously between the heads and wings of two cherubs of shining  silver.  And when she came nearer, she found that the smell of roses  with which the room was filled came from the fire-roses on the hearth.  Her grandmother was dressed in the loveliest pale blue velvet, over  which her hair, no longer white, but of a rich golden colour, streamed  like a cataract, here falling in dull gathered heaps, there rushing  away in smooth shining falls.  And ever as she looked, the hair seemed  pouring down from her head and vanishing in a golden mist ere it  reached the floor.  It flowed from under the edge of a circle of  shining silver, set with alternated pearls and opals.  On her dress was  no ornament whatever, neither was there a ring on her hand, or a  necklace or carcanet about her neck.  But her slippers glimmered with  the light of the Milky Way, for they were covered with seed-pearls and  opals in one mass.  Her face was that of a woman of three-and-twenty.    The princess was so bewildered with astonishment and admiration that  she could hardly thank her, and drew nigh with timidity, feeling dirty  and uncomfortable.  The lady was seated on a low chair by the side of  the fire, with hands outstretched to take her, but the princess hung  back with a troubled smile.    'Why, what's the matter?' asked her grandmother.  'You haven't been  doing anything wrong--I know that by your face, though it is rather  miserable.  What's the matter, my dear?'    And she still held out her arms.    'Dear grandmother,' said Irene, 'I'm not so sure that I haven't done  something wrong.  I ought to have run up to you at once when the  long-legged cat came in at the window, instead of running out on the  mountain and making myself such a fright.'    'You were taken by surprise, my child, and you are not so likely to do  it again.  It is when people do wrong things wilfully that they are the  more likely to do them again.  Come.'    And still she held out her arms.    'But, grandmother, you're so beautiful and grand with your crown on;  and I am so dirty with mud and rain!  I should quite spoil your  beautiful blue dress.'    With a merry little laugh the lady sprung from her chair, more lightly  far than Irene herself could, caught the child to her bosom, and,  kissing the tear-stained face over and over, sat down with her in her  lap.    'Oh, grandmother!  You'll make yourself such a mess!' cried Irene,  clinging to her.    'You darling! do you think I care more for my dress than for my little  girl?  Besides--look here.'    As she spoke she set her down, and Irene saw to her dismay that the  lovely dress was covered with the mud of her fall on the mountain road.  But the lady stooped to the fire, and taking from it, by the stalk in  her fingers, one of the burning roses, passed it once and again and a  third time over the front of her dress; and when Irene looked, not a  single stain was to be discovered.    'There!' said her grandmother, 'you won't mind coming to me now?'    But Irene again hung back, eying the flaming rose which the lady held  in her hand.    'You're not afraid of the rose--are you?' she said, about to throw it  on the hearth again.    'Oh! don't, please!' cried Irene.  'Won't you hold it to my frock and  my hands and my face?  And I'm afraid my feet and my knees want it too.'    'No, answered her grandmother, smiling a little sadly, as she threw the  rose from her; 'it is too hot for you yet.  It would set your frock in  a flame.

The \"Angle\" was quite lively that afternoon. All our own teams were  there, \"Stick-in-the-Mud\" having arrived first after all, with his load  in a better condition than the others. Such a genuine smile of  satisfaction beamed on his good-natured face, that I could not forbear  congratulating him on his triumph over difficulties. Several other teams  had brought supplies for the contractor; and fifty or sixty navvies going  out in search of work on the contract were camped about everywhere; some  in tents, some under waggons, while some sat up all night round the  fires, smoking and recounting their experience of the road. Many of the  men were very lame and stiff, after their hundred-mile tramp. Numbers of  Indians had come in to trade, and the ceaseless \"tom-tom\" from the wigwam  on the opposite bank told how they were gambling away their earnings.  They kept up this dissipation until daylight, when they went away in  canoes. The way-house being full when we arrived, the Hudson Bay  Company's officer very kindly vacated his quarters for us, and paid us  every attention in his power, even robbing his tiny garden of half its  early lettuce for our benefit. We had a comfortable night's sleep, much  enjoyed after our toils and troubles, and on a misty summer morning we  packed ourselves and our luggage into a large rowing-boat. The big  steamer, _Lady of the Lake_, being, as usual, stuck on a rock, about  forty miles out, we were towed behind a barge by a shaky-looking little  tug. Glad were we to have room to move about a little, and after the  crowded and cramping waggon the boat seemed a paradise.    Floating almost due north over the smooth waters of the bay, we were soon  on the Lake of the Woods. The scenery is very lovely; island follows  island. Some seem but a pile of moss-covered stone, every crevice filled  with ferns, blueberries, and wild juniper bushes; others are great masses  of rock, their perpendicular sides covered with curling black cariboo  moss and crowned with great pines; others, again, have shelving sandy  shores, covered with tangled vines and bright-hued wild-flowers. As we  passed along, each long stretch of the lake appeared more beautiful than  the last. Then the sun went down, turning to gold and crimson the fleecy  clouds mirrored in the lake, glinting on the distant white pines,  throwing into bold relief their darker brothers and the jagged walls of  moss-covered rock, in varied tints--black, red, green, and white. The  shadows slowly deepened, the long grey clouds hung like a curtain in the  sky, where the stars began to gleam softly. The varied foliage turned to  a deep, rich blue, shading into green like a peacock's tail. Silence was  around us, broken only by the weird cry of the loon diving in the distant  bay, and the ceaseless, monotonous puff-puff of the little tug as she  pursued her way over the peaceful waters.    About three or four o'clock--how little note we took of time!--we reached  the rock on which the big steamer was still fast, stopping to give her  another anchor and cable, and wishing her good luck and a speedy release.    We had been amusing ourselves during the afternoon by watching the cook  on the barge dive up and down through the narrow doorway of a sort of box  to a small rusty sheet-iron cooking-stove, with an equally rusty  stove-pipe. First seizing an axe, he chopped up some wood from a pile in  the corner, and filled the stove; then he dragged down a bag of flour into  his den; then up again he started, as suddenly as a Jack-in-the-box, for  a round tin; then for some flat pans. Next we heard him shouting from  below, \"Is that fire burning good, boys? Cram her full; pile in more  wood, and don't heed the smoke!\" and he suddenly appeared with the pans  full of buns, which were quickly baked. Then, leaning over the railing of  the barge, he cried--    \"If you would have your tea now, ladies, while the buns are hot, and  would pass along your tea-kettle, I have some tea ready for you.\"    Accepting his invitation with thanks, a tin can of buns was soon in our  boat, and never did the lightest tea-buns, served in the daintiest of  snowy napkins, taste more delicious. The number we demolished proved our  appreciation of his cookery.    About sundown we altered our course. After passing a pretty green hill,  from which a group of squaws, children, and dogs watched us, we turned to  the west and entered Clear Water Bay. The night was getting dark, damp,  and chilly, the children were sleepy, and we were tired and silent. The  men on the tug had become quiet and drowsy; nothing seemed to stir but  the flying sparks from the funnel of the tug, which dropped all around  us, and not even a cry from a loon broke through the stillness.    Suddenly--\"Here we are!\" rang out from a dozen voices, followed by a  heavy splash and a cry of \"A man overboard!\" While we peered out into the  darkness, dreading we knew not what, a laugh came from the barge. It was  only the short stove-pipe, which some one had knocked overboard in the  darkness. In our relief at finding that the accident was nothing worse,  we quite forgot the future misery of our poor friend the bun-maker, whose  cookery would have to be carried on amidst redoubled volumes of smoke. A  moment later the light of a camp fire appeared, and leaving the tug the  barge was poled up to it. One of the engineers belonging to Mr. C----'s  staff came to meet us. He had been ordered into town, and had waited at  Clear Water two days for the tug or steamer to take him to the \"Angle,\"  intending, if they did not arrive before morning, to cross next day in a  canoe.    We were soon comfortably settled in Mr. K----'s tent, while he directed a  party of Indians, who seemed to spring up in every direction, to put up  another. Some of the men on the barge had tents too; others made great  fires, piled with broken branches until the blaze shot up to the  tree-tops. The swift, silent movements of the Indians stepping hither  and thither, now in the glare of the fire, then lost in the surrounding  darkness; the chatter of the men; the barking of the dogs; and the sharp  crackle of the blazing logs helped to compose a strange and lively scene.  Gradually all grew quiet, and settled down for the night; the Indians,  rolling themselves in their blankets, lay down with their feet to the  fire, and we felt that this was indeed a fitting ending to our day upon  the Lake of the Woods.    I think one always wakes earlier when camping out than when sleeping in a  house. Our first night under canvas in the \"Nor'-west\" was no exception  to the rule. We were up and out before five o'clock; yet, early as it  was, we found our camping-ground almost deserted. The Indians, who were  nearly all \"packers,\" employed by the contractors to carry stuff over the  portages, had shouldered their packs and gone, and only a few of the men  still lingered. One poor fellow had caught several fish, and on being  asked what he would take for them, replied that he would gladly exchange  a couple for a piece of fat and the loan of a frying-pan to cook his own  meal in. This offer was at once accepted, and before long we had some  nicely cleaned fish added to our repast. The fire being stirred up, and  the kettle set on, I heard groans of despair over the condition of the  larder. The tin box which contained all that was left of our supplies  became more difficult to pack the more empty it grew, and, being unloaded  the night before by hands ignorant of the necessity of keeping it right  side up, the salt was spilt into the tea, and the preserves were smeared  over all the spoons. There was no bread left, and at last we had to  content ourselves with a rather light meal of fish and salted tea,  consoled by the reflection that we were near the end of our journey.    The camping-ground did not look at all romantic in the morning. Furniture  was scattered everywhere, boxes of all sizes and descriptions were strewn  about amidst dead fires and charred branches, and a general air of  untidiness and discomfort pervaded everything. Mr. K---- left us soon  after breakfast, and we set out to walk over our first portage.  [Footnote: A \"portage\" is the shore of a cataract, rapid, or chute, along  which the Indians carry their canoes and luggage. The Winnipeg River, in  its course of 160 miles from the Lake of the Woods to Lake Winnipeg,  makes a descent of 360 feet, occasioning falls, rapids, chutes, and  cataracts, which make its navigation difficult. The portaging, or  carrying power of the Indians, says Major Butler, is remarkable; one man  often carrying two hundred-weight for several miles. The skill with which  they avoid whirlpools, land below the fall and re-launch their canoes  above it beyond the power of the current, is unerring, and indispensable  to travellers.] This led us up a narrow pathway, all hills and hollows;  then over a smooth rock with the trail scarcely visible. A narrow gully  succeeded, still wet from the spring rain; then we passed through a belt  of low-growing trees leading to a bare rock, its crevices filled with  moss white as the rock itself. On reaching the highest point we stopped  to rest and look back. Clearwater Bay lay far below us, glistening in the  sunlight, and beyond, over the point that forms the bay, the lake and its  numberless islands extended for miles. As we descended, we met the  packers returning for another load, coming at a light, easy run, one  after the other, in Indian file, their straps hanging loosely over one  arm. Mr. C----'s own man, a handsome, lithe, graceful Indian of the Brant  tribe, stepped out of the line to shake hands with us and bid us welcome  to the contract, with a natural politeness and grace which would have  adorned the drawing-rooms "]]]
