In one leap he was over France, and another over Belgium; and with the  third he was standing by long ditches of water frozen fast, and over  them glided hundreds upon hundreds of lads and maids. Outside each door  stood a wee wooden shoe empty. Teig saw scores of them as he looked down  the ditch of a street.    \"What is the meanin' o' those shoes? \" he asked the fairies.    \"Ye poor lad!\" answered the wee man next to him; \"are ye not knowing  anything? This is the Gift Night of the year, when every man gives to  his neighbour.\"    A child came to the window of one of the houses, and in her hand was a  lighted candle. She was singing as she put the light down close to the  glass, and Teig caught the words:         \"Open your door an' greet ye the stranger--       For ye mind that the wee Lord had  naught but a manger.                   Mhuire as truagh!\"    \"'Tis the de'il's work!\" cried Teig, and he set the red cap more firmly  on his head.    \"I'm for another country.\"    I cannot be telling you a half of the adventures Teig had that night,  nor half the sights that he saw. But he passed by fields that held  sheaves of grain for the birds and doorsteps that held bowls of porridge  for the wee creatures. He saw lighted trees, sparkling and heavy with  gifts; and he stood outside the churches and watched the crowds pass in,  bearing gifts to the Holy Mother and Child.    At last the fairies straightened their caps and cried, \"Now for the  great hall in the King of England's palace!\"    Whist--and away they went, and Teig after them; and the first thing he  knew he was in London, not an arm's length from the King's throne. It  was a grander sight than he had seen in any other country. The hall was  filled entirely with lords and ladies; and the great doors were open for  the poor and the homeless to come in and warm themselves by the King's  fire and feast from the King's table. And many a hungry soul did the  King serve with his own hands.    Those that had anything to give gave it in return. It might be a bit of  music played on a harp or a pipe, or it might be a dance or a song; but  more often it was a wish, just, for good luck and safekeeping.    Teig was so taken up with the watching that he never heard the fairies  when they wished themselves on; moreover, he never saw the wee girl that  was fed, and went laughing away. But he heard a bit of her song as she  passed through the door:    \"Feed ye the hungry an' rest ye the weary, This ye must do for the sake  of Our Mary.\"    Then the anger had Teig. \"I'll stop your pestherin' tongue, once an' for  all time!\" and, catching the cap from his head, he threw it after her.  No sooner was the cap gone than every soul in the hall saw him. The next  moment they were about him, catching at his coat and crying:    \"Where is he from, what does he here? Bring him before the King!\" And  Teig was dragged along by a hundred hands to the throne where the King  sat.    \"He was stealing food,\" cried one.    \"He was robbing the King's jewels,\" cried another.    \"He looks evil,\" cried a third. \"Kill him!\"    And in a moment all the voices took it up and the hall rang with: \"Aye,  kill him, kill him!\"    Teig's legs took to trembling, and fear put the leash on his tongue; but  after a long silence he managed to whisper:    \"I have done evil to no one--no one!\"    \"Maybe,\" said the King; \"but have ye done good? Come, tell us, have ye  given aught to any one this night? If ye have, we will pardon ye.\"    Not a word could Teig say--fear tightened the leash--for he was knowing  full well there was no good to him that night.    \"Then ye must die,\" said the King. \"Will ye try hanging or beheading?\"    \"Hanging, please, your Majesty,\" said Teig.    The guards came rushing up and carried him off.    But as he was crossing the threshold of the hall a thought sprang at him  and held him.    \"Your Majesty,\" he called after him, \"will ye grant me a last request?\"    \"I will,\" said the King.    \"Thank ye. There's a wee red cap that I'm mortal fond of, and I lost  it a while ago; if I could be hung with it on, I would hang a deal more  comfortable.\"    The cap was found and brought to Teig.    \"Clip, clap, clip, clap, for my wee red cap, I wish I was home,\" he  sang.    Up and over the heads of the dumfounded guard he flew, and--whist--and  away out of sight. When he opened his eyes again, he was sitting dose  by his own hearth, with the fire burnt low. The hands of the clock were  still, the bolt was fixed firm in the door. The fairies' lights were  gone, and the only bright thing was the candle burning in old Barney's  cabin across the road.    A running of feet sounded outside, and then the snatch of a song         \"'Tis well that ye mind--ye who sit by the fire--       That the Lord he was born in a dark and cold byre.                  Mhuire as traugh!\"    \"Wait ye, whoever ye are!\" and Teig was away to the corner, digging fast  at the loose clay, as a terrier digs at a bone. He filled his hands full  of the shining gold, then hurried to the door, unbarring it.    The miller's wee Cassie stood there, peering at him out of the darkness.    \"Take those to the widow O'Donnelly, do ye hear? And take the rest to  the store. Ye tell Jamie to bring up all that he has that is eatable an'  dhrinkable; and to the neighbours ye say, 'Teig's keepin' the feast this  night.' Hurry now!\"    Teig stopped a moment on the threshold until the tramp of her feet had  died away; then he made a hollow of his two hands and called across the  road:    \"Hey there, Barney, will ye come over for a sup?\"          X. A STORY OF THE CHRIST-CHILD*    *Reprinted by permission of the author from her collection,  \"Christmastide,\" published by the Chicago Kindergarten College.    A German legend for Christmas Eve as told by    ELIZABETH HARKISON    Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, on the night before Christmas,  a little child was wandering all alone through the streets of a great  city. There were many people on the street, fathers and mothers, sisters  and brothers, uncles and aunts, and even gray-haired grandfathers and  grandmothers, all of whom were hurrying home with bundles of presents  for each other and for their little ones. Fine carriages rolled by,  express wagons rattled past, even old carts were pressed into service,  and all things seemed in a hurry and glad with expectation of the coming  Christmas morning.    From some of the windows bright lights were already beginning to stream  until it was almost as bright as day. But the little child seemed to  have no home, and wandered about listlessly from street to street. No  one took any notice of him except perhaps Jack Frost, who bit his bare  toes and made the ends of his fingers tingle. The north wind, too,  seemed to notice the child, for it blew against him and pierced his  ragged garments through and through, causing him to shiver with cold.  Home after home he passed, looking with longing eyes through the  windows, in upon the glad, happy children, most of whom were helping to  trim the Christmas trees for the coming morrow.    \"Surely,\" said the child to himself, \"where there is so must gladness  and happiness, some of it may be for me.\" So with timid steps he  approached a large and handsome house. Through the windows, he could see  a tall and stately Christmas tree already lighted. Many presents hung  upon it. Its green boughs were trimmed with gold and silver ornaments.  Slowly he climbed up the broad steps and gently rapped at the door. It  was opened by a large man-servant. He had a kindly face, although his  voice was deep and gruff. He looked at the little child for a moment,  then sadly shook his head and said, \"Go down off the steps. There is  no room here for such as you.\" He looked sorry as he spoke; possibly he  remembered his own little ones at home, and was glad that they were not  out in this cold and bitter night. Through the open door a bright light  shone, and the warm air, filled with fragrance of the Christmas pine,  rushed out from the inner room and greeted the little wanderer with a  kiss. As the child turned back into the cold and darkness, he wondered  why the footman had spoken thus, for surely, thought he, those little  children would love to have another companion join them in their joyous  Christmas festival. But the little children inside did not even know  that he had knocked at the door.    The street grew colder and darker as the child passed on. He went sadly  forward, saying to himself, \"Is there no one in all this great city who  will share the Christmas with me?\" Farther and farther down the street  he wandered, to where the homes were not so large and beautiful. There  seemed to be little children inside of nearly all the houses. They were  dancing and frolicking about. Christmas trees could be seen in nearly  every window, with beautiful dolls and trumpets and picture-books and  balls and tops and other dainty toys hung upon them. In one window the  child noticed a little lamb made of soft white wool. Around its neck was  tied a red ribbon. It had evidently been hung on the tree for one of the  children. The little stranger stopped before this window and looked long  and earnestly at the beautiful things inside, but most of all was he  drawn toward the white lamb. At last creeping up to the window-pane, he  gently tapped upon it. A little girl came to the window and looked out  into the dark street where the snow had now begun to fall. She saw the  child, but she only frowned and shook her head and said, \"Go away and  come some other time. We are too busy to take care of you now.\" Back  into the dark,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#13)"],[1,"and the dead fish look  virtually leaped back into his eyes.    \"So you came to the Devil's Den?\" he murmured in a soft yet deadly  tone. \"And how did two on their way to Australia know of the Devil's  Den? Perhaps somebody told you here in Singapore, eh? Told you that old  Serrangi would look out for you, so?\"    \"So, there appear to be three, not two, fools in this room!\"    Freddy Farmer's voice was like a machine gun going off. Dave started  violently inwardly, and he watched for the look of blind rage to rush  over Serrangi's ugly face. But no rage appeared. Instead the Devil's  Den owner glanced at Freddy with a new interest. A new interest, and  just the slightest touch of respect in his eyes.    \"With a tongue like that, you must have been close to death many times  in your life, my friend!\" the Sumatran grunted. \"But perhaps I do not  understand the meaning of your words, eh?\"    \"The meaning was plain enough!\" Freddy Farmer snapped as he thrust  his chin out. \"We of the Gestapo who serve the Fuehrer, and the  Fatherland, unto the death, do not go about revealing who we are by  stupid questions. _Mein Gott!_ Do you think the Devil's Den is not  known beyond the borders of Singapore? Do you think that in Berlin  the name, Serrangi, has no meaning? Do you think we do not plan ahead  for all eventualities? _Himmel!_ We were put ashore with our money,  our forged papers, and everything we carried, lost! Would you have us  sit on the beach and cry great tears, and hope for the miracle of a  boat coming along to pick us up and take us southward to Australia? Of  course not! There was but one thing to do. We did it. We came here and  identified ourselves so that we could talk with you.\"    \"I see, I see,\" Serrangi murmured in an almost apologetic tone. \"But  more than one poor fool has thrown away his life out here because of  his tongue. However, you convince me that you are not of that type.  Torpedoed, eh? And going to Australia? What was to be the nature of  your work in Australia?\"    The Sumatran looked at Dave as he asked the question, but the Yank born  R.A.F. Flight Lieutenant was not to be caught off guard that easily. He  dragged down one corner of his mouth and gave Serrangi a hard stare.    \"In Berlin there is one _Herr Himmler_,\" he said. \"If you communicate  with him perhaps he will be good enough to tell you of the work we were  to do in Australia.\"    The Devil's Den owner grunted, and then his thin body shook with silent  laughter.    \"So!\" he finally exclaimed. \"So much for my curiosity, eh? It would  seem that there are _no_ fools in this room. And at least two who are  well trained members of the Gestapo. But I am still interested about  your unfortunate affair at sea. Tell me about it. Perhaps I have sailed  on the same ship. Perhaps I even know her captain. Tell me about it.\"          CHAPTER NINE    _The Gods Smile_      Serrangi of the Devil's Den made the request in a very matter of fact,  friend to friend tone. But it sounded alarm bells inside Dave. He  suddenly knew that the next few moments could well mean life or death  for Freddy and him. Their faked story had to be good. It had to be  better than that. It had to be perfect. One little slip-up, one tiny  flaw, and Serrangi would pounce on it like a striking vulture. It was  obvious that the man was going to check and double-check every little  detail with what he himself knew. And because of the high position  that Serrangi undoubtedly held in the shadier circles of Singapore,  he probably was well informed on everything about everything. Yes,  here was the test. Here was the test of presenting the ship torpedoing  knowledge with which Air Vice Marshal Bostworth had acquainted them.    Dave shrugged, made a little gesture, and without asking Serrangi  permission he casually dropped into a vacant chair.    \"It was not something one likes to remember,\" he grunted. \"However, if  you like to hear of such things, I see no reason why we should not tell  you.\"    Dave shrugged again and swiveled around to look at Freddy who had  followed his lead and also dropped comfortably into a chair.    \"Do you wish to tell him, my friend?\" Dave asked. \"I was unconscious  for a bit, you know. From the explosion. Perhaps something happened  during that time that I miss.\"    \"If it did, I do not remember,\" the English youth replied in a bored  voice. \"No, go ahead and tell him all about it. Then, perhaps, we can  get on with more important things.\"    Dave made a face, hunched a shoulder, and swiveled back to face  Serrangi. He scowled for a moment as though collecting his memory  thoughts, then he launched into a detailed torpedoing at sea. It was  really a masterpiece of description. In fact, it was almost as though  Dave and Freddy had actually lived through it! Serrangi listened  eagerly, and every now and then he interrupted with a pointed question.  However, through the grace of God, and Dave's quick wits, the Yank was  able to give a satisfactory answer to each and every question. Finally,  when he was sweating inwardly from pent up nervousness, he came to the  end of his bogus tale.    \"And so we are here,\" he grunted. \"And next time I hope we can go  by airplane. I am not one who is happy on the sea. Any sea! So, now  you know all about it. Consider yourself fortunate that you were not  aboard. It was not pleasant, and we were not saved through any efforts  of our own. I shall always believe that it was the great invisible hand  of _Der Fuehrer_ that reached out and protected us. It is not the first  time in my life that I have felt that way, either.\"    \"It was at least the will of our leader, that you should be saved,\"  Serrangi said with almost a reverent note in his ashy voice. \"But just  the same it was unfortunate.\"    The Devil's Den owner stopped and scowled at the ash of his cigarette.  For a long time he didn't say anything. Dave and Freddy, believing  that silence was their best bet, didn't so much as utter a peep. They  sat perfectly still looking at Serrangi with their fingers mentally  crossed, and a prayer in their hearts. They had driven in the opening  wedge. It was now up to Serrangi to make the next move ... if any. And  that was the point! That was the thought that so completely filled  their heads they felt ready to explode from the pressure.    Would Serrangi take them into his crowd? Would he assign them to some  espionage work here in Singapore and give them the stepping stone they  needed to attain their real objective? Or would he simply express  sorrow at their plight, but state that it was not up to him to take  care of two stranded Gestapo agents? But, perhaps more important than  anything else, _did Serrangi believe their story_? He acted as though  he did, but that could mean most anything. And, likewise, nothing. What  thoughts were passing through that brain of his behind the hideous  face? Was he sealing their doom ... or what?    As the silence continued it was all Dave could do to refrain from  encouraging the Sumatran to speak. It was almost as though he had sunk  back into the weird trance he'd been in when they first entered the  room. His face was a blank, save for the frown. And the fishy look was  creeping back into his eyes again. Then, suddenly, Freddy Farmer took  the bull by the horns.    \"Well, I can see we were mistaken!\" he said harshly. \"There is no help  to be had here. I believe I'll remember that fact when I do return to  Berlin!\"    \"Sit down, or there'll be a knife in your heart!\"    Serrangi's voice was like the hiss of a deadly snake coiled to strike.  His eyes seemed to flash sparks as he fixed them on Freddy Farmer.  And one hand darted under his dirty jacket like a little shaft of  lightning. Freddy managed to glare but he sat down very quickly.    \"That is better,\" Serrangi said in a softer voice. \"Listen to me, you  of the quick tongue! In Germany you may be lord and master over many  slaves, but here in Singapore _Serrangi_ holds a man's life or his  death in his hands. Remember that! Your Fuehrer may be the greatest man  ever born. I truly believe he is. But it is not my love for Germany, or  your Fuehrer's cause that makes me work for you Nazis. It is the price  you _pay me_. I am only interested in wealth, and my own power. So do  not speak your sharp Nazi tongue to me. I will not crawl. Instead I  will slit your throat and throw you to the street dogs, and forget all  about you by the morrow.\"    The owner of the Devil's Den nodded curtly for emphasis, and made a  little motion with one hand as though brushing something aside.    \"And now that we understand each other,\" he continued after the pause.  \"We can talk of things to do. First, it will be impossible for me to  arrange for you to continue your journey to Australia. There is not  a boat leaving Singapore these days that you could possibly hide on.  And....\"    \"But as passengers?\" Dave grunted to add to the impression that they  really were Australia bound.    \"Even more impossible!\" the Sumatran grated at him. \"The British would  unmask you in five minutes. No, I cannot help you at all to continue to  Australia.\"    \"Then, perhaps, here in Singapore?\" Freddy Farmer murmured with a world  of genuine hopefulness in his voice. \"Perhaps you have work for us? It  does not matter where one serves, so long as one serves the Fatherland.\"    Serrangi shook his head and took a fresh cigarette from a carved ivory  box on the desk.    \"There are too many of you Nazi agents in Singapore, as it is,\" he  grunted. \"The dog British are not stupid all day _and_ night. They feel  war in the Far East is not far off, and their Intelligence Service is  on the alert. No, I could not give you anything to do in Singapore  that would make you even worth your food and drink. It was indeed most  unfortunate that you were torpedoed at sea.\"    Serrangi nodded and sighed as though that ended everything. Dave's  heart dropped down into"]]]
