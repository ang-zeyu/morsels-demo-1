In the bows of two of the canoes were the runners that the chief had  sent forth three hours earlier.  It was evident that they had been  dispatched to follow and bring back this party, and that the signal  from the bank was one that had been determined upon before they left  the village.    In a few moments the dugouts drew up to the verdure-clad bank.   The  native warriors filed out, and with them a half-dozen white men.  Sullen, ugly-looking customers they were, and none more so than the  evil-faced, black-bearded man who commanded them.    \"Where is the white man your messengers report to be with you?\" he  asked of the chief.    \"This way, bwana,\" replied the native.  \"Carefully have I kept silence  in the village that he might be still asleep when you returned.  I do  not know that he is one who seeks you to do you harm, but he questioned  me closely about your coming and your going, and his appearance is as  that of the one you described, but whom you believed safe in the  country which you called Jungle Island.    \"Had you not told me this tale I should not have recognized him, and  then he might have gone after and slain you.   If he is a friend and no  enemy, then no harm has been done, bwana; but if he proves to be an  enemy, I should like very much to have a rifle and some ammunition.\"    \"You have done well,\" replied the white man, \"and you shall have the  rifle and ammunition whether he be a friend or enemy, provided that you  stand with me.\"    \"I shall stand with you, bwana,\" said the chief, \"and now come and look  upon the stranger, who sleeps within my village.\"    So saying, he turned and led the way toward the hut, in the shadow of  which the unconscious Tarzan slept peacefully.    Behind the two men came the remaining whites and a score of warriors;  but the raised forefingers of the chief and his companion held them all  to perfect silence.    As they turned the corner of the hut, cautiously and upon tiptoe, an  ugly smile touched the lips of the white as his eyes fell upon the  giant figure of the sleeping ape-man.    The chief looked at the other inquiringly.  The latter nodded his head,  to signify that the chief had made no mistake in his suspicions.  Then  he turned to those behind him and, pointing to the sleeping man,  motioned for them to seize and bind him.    A moment later a dozen brutes had leaped upon the surprised Tarzan, and  so quickly did they work that he was securely bound before he could  make half an effort to escape.    Then they threw him down upon his back, and as his eyes turned toward  the crowd that stood near, they fell upon the malign face of Nikolas  Rokoff.    A sneer curled the Russian's lips.  He stepped quite close to Tarzan.    \"Pig!\" he cried.  \"Have you not learned sufficient wisdom to keep away  from Nikolas Rokoff?\"    Then he kicked the prostrate man full in the face.    \"That for your welcome,\" he said.    \"Tonight, before my Ethiop friends eat you, I shall tell you what has  already befallen your wife and child, and what further plans I have for  their futures.\"          Chapter 8    The Dance of Death      Through the luxuriant, tangled vegetation of the Stygian jungle night a  great lithe body made its way sinuously and in utter silence upon its  soft padded feet.  Only two blazing points of yellow-green flame shone  occasionally with the reflected light of the equatorial moon that now  and again pierced the softly sighing roof rustling in the night wind.    Occasionally the beast would stop with high-held nose, sniffing  searchingly.  At other times a quick, brief incursion into the branches  above delayed it momentarily in its steady journey toward the east.  To  its sensitive nostrils came the subtle unseen spoor of many a tender  four-footed creature, bringing the slaver of hunger to the cruel,  drooping jowl.    But steadfastly it kept on its way, strangely ignoring the cravings of  appetite that at another time would have sent the rolling, fur-clad  muscles flying at some soft throat.    All that night the creature pursued its lonely way, and the next day it  halted only to make a single kill, which it tore to fragments and  devoured with sullen, grumbling rumbles as though half famished for  lack of food.    It was dusk when it approached the palisade that surrounded a large  native village.  Like the shadow of a swift and silent death it circled  the village, nose to ground, halting at last close to the palisade,  where it almost touched the backs of several huts.  Here the beast  sniffed for a moment, and then, turning its head upon one side,  listened with up-pricked ears.    What it heard was no sound by the standards of human ears, yet to the  highly attuned and delicate organs of the beast a message seemed to be  borne to the savage brain.  A wondrous transformation was wrought in  the motionless mass of statuesque bone and muscle that had an instant  before stood as though carved out of the living bronze.    As if it had been poised upon steel springs, suddenly released, it rose  quickly and silently to the top of the palisade, disappearing,  stealthily and cat-like, into the dark space between the wall and the  back of an adjacent hut.    In the village street beyond women were preparing many little fires and  fetching cooking-pots filled with water, for a great feast was to be  celebrated ere the night was many hours older.   About a stout stake  near the centre of the circling fires a little knot of black warriors  stood conversing, their bodies smeared with white and blue and ochre in  broad and grotesque bands.   Great circles of colour were drawn about  their eyes and lips, their breasts and abdomens, and from their  clay-plastered coiffures rose gay feathers and bits of long, straight  wire.    The village was preparing for the feast, while in a hut at one side of  the scene of the coming orgy the bound victim of their bestial  appetites lay waiting for the end.  And such an end!    Tarzan of the Apes, tensing his mighty muscles, strained at the bonds  that pinioned him; but they had been re-enforced many times at the  instigation of the Russian, so that not even the ape-man's giant brawn  could budge them.    Death!    Tarzan had looked the Hideous Hunter in the face many a time, and  smiled.  And he would smile again tonight when he knew the end was  coming quickly; but now his thoughts were not of himself, but of those  others--the dear ones who must suffer most because of his passing.    Jane would never know the manner of it.  For that he thanked Heaven;  and he was thankful also that she at least was safe in the heart of the  world's greatest city.  Safe among kind and loving friends who would do  their best to lighten her misery.    But the boy!    Tarzan writhed at the thought of him.  His son!  And now he--the mighty  Lord of the Jungle--he, Tarzan, King of the Apes, the only one in all  the world fitted to find and save the child from the horrors that  Rokoff's evil mind had planned--had been trapped like a silly, dumb  creature.  He was to die in a few hours, and with him would go the  child's last chance of succour.    Rokoff had been in to see and revile and abuse him several times during  the afternoon; but he had been able to wring no word of remonstrance or  murmur of pain from the lips of the giant captive.    So at last he had given up, reserving his particular bit of exquisite  mental torture for the last moment, when, just before the savage spears  of the cannibals should for ever make the object of his hatred immune  to further suffering, the Russian planned to reveal to his enemy the  true whereabouts of his wife whom he thought safe in England.    Dusk had fallen upon the village, and the ape-man could hear the  preparations going forward for the torture and the feast.   The dance  of death he could picture in his mind's eye--for he had seen the thing  many times in the past.  Now he was to be the central figure, bound to  the stake.    The torture of the slow death as the circling warriors cut him to bits  with the fiendish skill, that mutilated without bringing  unconsciousness, had no terrors for him.  He was inured to suffering  and to the sight of blood and to cruel death; but the desire to live  was no less strong within him, and until the last spark of life should  flicker and go out, his whole being would remain quick with hope and  determination.   Let them relax their watchfulness but for an instant,  he knew that his cunning mind and giant muscles would find a way to  escape--escape and revenge.    As he lay, thinking furiously on every possibility of self-salvation,  there came to his sensitive nostrils a faint and a familiar scent.  Instantly every faculty of his mind was upon the alert.  Presently his  trained ears caught the sound of the soundless presence without--behind  the hut wherein he lay.   His lips moved, and though no sound came  forth that might have been appreciable to a human ear beyond the walls  of his prison, yet he realized that the one beyond would hear.  Already  he knew who that one was, for his nostrils had told him as plainly as  your eyes or mine tell us of the identity of an old friend whom we come  upon in broad daylight.    An instant later he heard the soft sound of a fur-clad body and padded  feet scaling the outer wall behind the hut and then a tearing at the  poles which formed the wall.   Presently through the hole thus made  slunk a great beast, pressing its cold muzzle close to his neck.    It was Sheeta, the panther.    The beast snuffed round the prostrate man, whining a little.  There was  a limit to the interchange of ideas which could take place between  these two, and so Tarzan could not be sure that Sheeta understood all  that he attempted to communicate to him.  That the man was tied and  helpless Sheeta could, of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8502"],[0,"Common Diseases of Farm Animals (#13)"],[1,"sufficient exercise. The  male is more often affected by the latter cause than the female. This is  because the average stockman does not consider exercise given under the  right conditions an important factor in maintaining the vigor of the male.  Young males should not be given excessive intercourse with the female. Such  practice is certain to seriously affect the potency of the animal. The  excessive use of the stallion can be avoided by practising artificial  impregnation of a part of the mares that he is called to serve. Sterility  caused by growths and closure of the os may be corrected by an operation.    Chronic inflammation of the maternal passages should be treated by  irrigating the parts with a one per cent warm water solution of lysol, or  liquor cresolis compound. The parts should be irrigated daily for as long a  period as necessary. Fat animals should be subjected to a rigid diet and  given plenty of exercise. Following this treatment a stimulating ration may  be fed for the purpose of encouraging the sexual desire. In weak and  debilitated animals, the cause should first be removed and a proper ration  fed. Cantharides and strychnine are the drugs most highly recommended for  increasing the sexual desire.    SIGNS OF PREGNANCY.--The signs which characterize pregnancy are numerous  and varied. For convenience we may classify the many signs of pregnancy  under two heads, probable and positive. Under the head of probable signs,  we may group the following symptoms of pregnancy: cessation of heat;  changes in the animal's disposition; increase in the volume of the abdomen  and tendency to put on fat. The positive signs are the change in the volume  of the udder; the secretion of milk; the movement of the foetus and  presence of the foetus in the womb, as determined by rectal examination or  by the feel of the abdomen.    _The probable signs_ are not reliable, and should be considered only in  connection with some positive sign. Persons who base their opinion of the  condition of an animal that is supposed to be pregnant on probable signs,  are frequently mistaken. It has frequently happened that animals whose  condition was not at all certain have given birth to young, without giving  rise to what may be termed characteristic probable signs.    The earliest probable symptom is the cessation of heat. In the large  pregnant animals, irregular heat periods may occur, but in the majority of  cases we may safely consider the animal impregnated if several heat periods  are passed over.    It has been generally observed that the disposition of the pregnant animal  is changed. They become more quiet and less nervous and irritable. The  tendency of pregnant animals to put on fat is frequently taken advantage of  by the stockman, who may allow the boar to run with the herd during the  latter period of fattening.    The increase in the volume of the abdomen may be considered a _positive_  sign of pregnancy in the small animals, but in the mare and cow it can not  be depended on. Animals that are pregnant for the first time, do not show  as great an increase in the volume of the abdomen as do animals that have  gone through successive pregnant periods. The volume of the abdomen may  vary greatly in the different individuals, and can not be depended on as a  positive indication of pregnancy during the first two-thirds of the period  of pregnancy in the larger domestic animals.    Comparatively early in pregnancy, the presence of a foetus can be  determined by feeling the uterus through the wall of the rectum. In the  small domestic animals the feeling of the abdomen gives the best results.  In the cow this method of diagnosis is practised during the latter periods  of pregnancy. The examiner stands with his back toward the animal's head,  and on the right side of the cow and the left side of the mare. The palm of  the hand is applied against the abdominal wall, about eight or ten inches  in front of the stifle and just below the flank. Moderate pressure is used,  and if a hard, voluminous mass is felt, or if the foetus moves, it is a  sure sign that the animal is pregnant. It is not uncommon for the foetus to  show some movement in the morning, or after the animal drinks freely of  cold water. The increase in the volume of the udder occurs at a  comparatively early period in animals that are pregnant for the first time.  The secretion of milk and the dropping of the muscles of the quarters  indicate that parturition is near. The Abderhalden test for determining  whether or not an animal is pregnant is now practised.    HYGIENE OF PREGNANT ANIMALS.--Pregnant animals that are confined in a  pasture that is free from injurious weeds and not too rough or hilly, and  where the animals have access to clean water and the necessary shelter,  seldom suffer from an abnormal birth. Here they live under the most  favorable conditions for taking exercise, securing a suitable diet and  avoiding injury. It may not be possible in managing breeding animals to  provide such surroundings at all times, but we should observe every  possible hygienic precaution, especially if the animal has reached the  later periods of pregnancy.    All pregnant animals are inclined to be lazy, but, if permitted, will take  the necessary exercise. Pregnant mares are usually worked. Such exercise  does no harm, providing the work is not hard or of an unusual character.  Cows are usually subject to more natural conditions than other domestic  animals.    Protecting pregnant animals against injuries resulting from crowding,  slipping and fighting is an important part of their care. Injuries from  crowding together in the sleeping quarters and about feeding-troughs, or  through doors and climbing over low partitions are common causes of injury  in pregnant sows. Crowding together in the stable or yard, or through  doorways, fighting, and slipping on floors, or icy places sometimes results  in injury. It is rare, however, for cows to abort from an injury, but  parturition may not be completely free from disagreeable complications.  Under the conditions mentioned retention of the fetal membranes is common.    Ewes frequently suffer from too close confinement during late winter. Sows  are often subject to the most unhygienic conditions. This is shown in the  heavy death-rate in sows and pigs. During the late winter and early spring  the conditions may be such as not to permit of exercise. Stormy, snowy,  muddy weather is common at this season of the year. Persons caring for ewes  and sows should see that they take sufficient exercise. It may be necessary  to drive them about for a short time each day. At such times it may be  advisable to give them a laxative dose of oil, or give a laxative with the  feed. When there is any indication of constipation, this should be  practised.    Pregnant animals should be fed carefully. We may feed animals that are not  in this condition in a careless fashion, but if pregnant, over-feeding, the  feeding of a fattening ration, or spoiled feed, and sudden changes in the  feed can not be practised with any degree of safety. A bulky ration of dry  feed and drinking impure, or too little, water may cause constipation,  acute indigestion and abortion. The ration fed should contain the necessary  inorganic and organic elements for the building up of the body tissues of  the foetus.    At the end of the parturition period, separate quarters should be provided.  The mare or cow should be given a comfortable clean stall away from the  other animals. The ewe should be provided with a warm room if the weather  is cold. It is always best to give the sow a separate pen that is dry and  clean, and away from the other animals. All danger from injury to the  mother and young should be guarded against.    ABORTION.--The expulsion of the foetus at any time during the period of  gestation, when it is not sufficiently developed to live independently of  the mother, is termed abortion. Abortion may be either _accidental_ or  _infectious_. Accidental abortion is more commonly met with in the mare and  sow than the infectious form. In ruminants the opposite holds true.    _The causes of accidental abortion_ are faulty methods of feeding and care.  Injuries, acute indigestion, mouldy, spoiled feeds, chilling resulting from  exposure and drinking ice-cold water, nervousness brought on by fright, or  excitement and general diseases are the common causes of abortion.    _Infectious abortion_ is most common in cows. Other domestic animals that  may be affected are the mare, sow and ewe.    _It is caused_ by a specific germ. The _Bacillus abortus_ of Bang is the  cause of abortion in cows, but the specific germ that produces abortion in  other species of animals has not been proven. In this country, Keer, Good,  Giltner and others have proven that the Bang bacillus of abortion is  infectious for other species of animals, and outbreaks of this disease have  been said to occur among breeding ewes pastured and fed on infected  premises. Its infectiousness for the females of other species has never  been proven in natural outbreaks.    The disease-producing germs are present in the body of the foetus, the  fetal membranes, the discharge from the maternal passages, the faeces and  milk of aborting animals. The male may carry the infection in the sheath,  urethra and on the penis. The natural avenues of infection are the maternal  passages and digestive tract.    It is very seldom that abortion is carried from one herd to another by  means other than through the breeding of animals free from abortion to  animals affected by this disease. The purchase of a bull or cow from an  infected herd and breeding them to animals that are free from disease, is a  common method of spreading the disease. After serving the diseased animal,  the male may carry the bacillus of abortion into the maternal passages of  the next cow he serves. There are numerous cases "]]]
