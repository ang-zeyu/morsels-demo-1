Leo awoke in some degree to the gravity of the situation, and saw  the advantage of making common cause with Charles, whose help in Germany  was needful. Accordingly he made a secret treaty with the Emperor for  mutual defence, and was anxious to draw England to the same side. The  religious question was beginning to be of importance, and Francis I. was  regarded as a favourer of heretics, whereas Henry VIII. was strictly  orthodox, was busy in suppressing Lutheran opinions at home, and was  preparing his book which should confute Luther for ever.    Another circumstance also greatly affected the attitude of Charles, the  death of his minister Chièvres, who had been his tutor in his youth, and  continued to exercise great influence over his actions. Charles was  cold, reserved, and ill-adapted to make friends. It was natural that one  whom he had trusted from his boyhood should sway his policy at the  first. Chièvres was a Burgundian, whose life had been spent in saving  Burgundy from French aggression, and the continuance of this watchful  care was his chief object till the last. His first thought was for  Burgundy, and to protect that he wished for peace with France and  opposed an adventurous policy. On his death in May 1521 Charles V.  entered on a new course of action. He felt himself for the first time  his own master, and took his responsibilities upon himself. He seems to  have admitted to himself that the advice of Chièvres had not always been  wise, and he never allowed another minister to gain the influence  Chièvres had possessed. He contented himself with officials who might  each represent some part of his dominions, and whose advice he used in  turns, but none of whom could claim to direct his policy as a whole.    Chief of these officials was a Savoyard, Mercurino della Gattinara,  whose diplomatic skill was now of great service to the Emperor.  Gattinara was a man devoted to his master's interests, and equal to  Wolsey in resoluteness and pertinacity. Hitherto Wolsey had had the  strongest will amongst the statesmen of Europe, and had reaped all the  advantages of his strength. In Gattinara he met with an opponent who was  in many ways his match. It is true that Gattinara had not Wolsey's  genius, and was not capable of Wolsey's far-reaching schemes; but he had  a keen eye to the interests of the moment, and could neither be baffled  by _finesse_ nor overborne by menaces. His was the hand that first  checked Wolsey's victorious career.    So it was that through a combination of causes the prospects of peace  suddenly darkened just as Wolsey was preparing to stand forward as the  mediator of Europe. Doubtless he hoped, when first he put forward the  project of a conference, that it might be the means of restoring his  original design of 1518, a European peace under the guarantee of  England. Since that had broken down he had been striving to maintain  England's influence by separate alliances; he hoped in the conference to  use this position in the interests of peace. But first of all the  alliance with the Emperor must be made closer, and the Emperor showed  signs of demanding that this closer alliance should be purchased by a  breach with France. If war was inevitable, England had most to gain by  an alliance with Charles, to whom its friendship could offer substantial  advantages, as England, in case of war, could secure to Charles the  means of communicating between the Netherlands and Spain, which would be  cut off if France were hostile and the Channel were barred by English  ships. Moreover the prospect of a marriage between Charles and the  Princess Mary was naturally gratifying to Henry; while English industry  would suffer from any breach of trading relations with the Netherlands,  and the notion of war with France was still popular with the English.    So Wolsey started for Calais at the beginning of August with the  intention of strengthening England's alliance with the Emperor, that  thereby England's influence might be more powerful. Charles on the other  hand was resolved on war; he did not wish for peace by England's  mediation, but he wished to draw England definitely into the league  between himself and the Pope against France. Wolsey knew that much  depended on his own cleverness, and nerved himself for the greatest  caution, as Francis was beginning to be suspicious of the preparations  of Charles, and the attitude of affairs was not promising for a pacific  mediation.    This became obvious at the first interview of Wolsey with the imperial  envoys, foremost amongst whom was Gattinara. They were commissioned to  treat about the marriage of Charles with the Princess Mary, and about a  secret undertaking for war against France; but their instructions  contained nothing tending to peace. The French envoys were more pacific,  as war was not popular in France.    On 7th August the conference was opened under Wolsey's presidency; but  Gattinara did nothing save dwell upon the grievances of his master  against France; he maintained that France had been the aggressor in  breaking the existing treaty; he had no powers to negotiate peace or  even a truce, but demanded England's help, which had been promised to  the party first aggrieved. The French retorted in the same strain, but  it was clear that they were not averse to peace, and were willing to  trust to Wolsey's mediation. Wolsey saw that he could make little out of  Gattinara. He intended to visit the Emperor, who had come to Bruges for  the purpose, as soon as he had settled with the imperial envoys the  preliminaries of an alliance; now he saw that the only hope of  continuing the conference lay in winning from Charles better terms than  the stubborn Gattinara would concede. So he begged the French envoys to  remain in Calais while he visited the Emperor and arranged with him  personally for a truce. As the French were desirous of peace, they  consented.    On 16th August Wolsey entered Bruges in royal state, with a retinue of  1000 horsemen. Charles came to the city gate to meet him, and received  him almost as an equal. Wolsey did not dismount from his horse, but  received Charles's embrace seated. He was given rooms in Charles's  palace, and the next day at church Charles sat by Wolsey's side and  shared the same kneeling stool with him. Their private conferences dealt  solely with the accord between England and the Emperor. Wolsey saw that  it was useless to urge directly the cause of peace, and trusted to use  for this purpose the advantages which his alliance would give. He  succeeded, however, in considerably modifying the terms which had been  first proposed. He diminished the amount of dowry which Mary was to  receive on her marriage, and put off her voyage to the Emperor till she  should reach the age of twelve, instead of seven, which was first  demanded. Similarly he put off the period when England should declare  war against France till the spring of 1523, though he agreed that if war  was being waged between Francis and Charles in November, England should  send some help to Charles. Thus he still preserved England's freedom of  action, and deferred a rupture with France. Every one thought that many  things might happen in the next few months, and that England was pledged  to little. Further, Wolsey guarded the pecuniary interests of Henry by  insisting that if France ceased to pay its instalments for the purchase  of Tournai, the Emperor should make good the loss. He also stipulated  that the treaty should be kept a profound secret, so that the  proceedings of the conference should still go on.    Wolsey was impressed by Charles, and gave a true description of his  character to Henry: \"For his age he is very wise and understanding his  affairs, right cold and temperate in speech, with assured manner,  couching his words right well and to good purpose when he doth speak.\"  We do not know what was Charles's private opinion of Wolsey. He can  scarcely have relished Wolsey's lofty manner, for Wolsey bore himself  with all the dignity of a representative of his king. Thus, the King of  Denmark, Charles's brother-in-law, was in Bruges, and sought an  interview with Wolsey, who answered that it was unbecoming for him to  receive in his chamber any king to whom he was not commissioned; if the  King of Denmark wished to speak with him, let him meet him, as though by  accident, in the garden of the palace.    When the provisions of the treaty had been drafted, Wolsey set out for  Calais on 26th August, and was honourably escorted out of Bruges by the  Emperor himself. On his return the business of the conference began, and  was dragged on through three weary months. The imperial envoys naturally  saw nothing to be gained by the conference except keeping open the  quarrel with France till November, when Henry was bound to send help to  the Emperor if peace were not made. Wolsey remained true to his two  principles: care for English interests, and a desire for peace. He  secured protection for the fishery of the Channel in case of war, and he  cautiously strove to lead up both parties to see their advantage in  making a truce if they could not agree upon a peace. It was inevitable  that these endeavours should bring on Wolsey the suspicions of both. The  French guessed something of the secret treaty from the warlike  appearance which England began to assume, and cried out that they were  being deceived. The imperial envoys could not understand how one who had  just signed a treaty with their master, could throw obstacles in their  way and pursue a mediating policy of his own. Really both sides were  only engaged in gaining time, and their attention was more fixed upon  events in the field than on any serious project of agreement.    When in the middle of September the French arms won some successes,  Gattinara showed himself inclined to negotiate for a truce. The  conference, which hitherto had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],[0,"The Crisis — Complete (#13)"],[1," word,\" he replied. \"But I met old  Sparks at the Tavern, and he started to talk about the horses, and--and  he insisted.\"    \"And you hadn't the strength of character,\" she said, scornfully, \"to  refuse.\"    \"Pshaw, Jinny, a gentleman must be a gentleman. I'm no Yankee.\"    For a space Virginia answered nothing. Then she said, without changing  her position:    \"If you were, you might be worth something.\"    \"Virginia!\"    She did not reply, but sat gazing toward the water. He began to pace the  veranda, fiercely.    \"Look here, Jinny,\" he cried, pausing in front of her. \"There are some  things you can't say to me, even in jest.\"    Virginia rose, flicked her riding-whip, and started down the steps.    \"Don't be a fool, Max,\" she said.    He followed her, bewildered. She skirted the garden, passed the orchard,  and finally reached a summer house perched on a knoll at the edge of the  wood. Then she seated herself on a bench, silently. He took a place on  the opposite side, with his feet stretched out, dejectedly.    \"I'm tired trying to please you,\" he said. \"I have been a fool. You  don't care that for me. It was all right when I was younger, when there  was no one else to take you riding, and jump off the barn for your  amusement, Miss. Now you have Tom Catherwood and Jack Brinsmade and  the Russell boys running after you, it's different. I reckon I'll go to  Kansas. There are Yankees to shoot in Kansas.\"    He did not see her smile as he sat staring at his feet.    \"Max,\" said she, all at once, \"why don't you settle down to something?  Why don't you work?\"    Young Mr. Colfax's arm swept around in a circle.    \"There are twelve hundred acres to look after here, and a few niggers.  That's enough for a gentleman.\"    \"Pooh!\" exclaimed his cousin, \"this isn't a cotton plantation. Aunt  Lillian doesn't farm for money. If she did, you would have to check your  extravagances mighty quick, sir.\"    \"I look after Pompey's reports, I do as much work as my ancestors,\"  answered Clarence, hotly.    \"Ah, that is the trouble,\" said Virginia.    \"What do you mean?\" her cousin demanded.    \"We have been gentlemen too long,\" said Virginia.    The boy straightened up and rose. The pride and wilfulness of  generations was indeed in his handsome face. And something else went  with it. Around the mouth a grave tinge of indulgence.    \"What has your life been?\" she went on, speaking rapidly. \"A mixture of  gamecocks and ponies and race horses and billiards, and idleness at the  Virginia Springs, and fighting with other boys. What do you know? You  wouldn't go to college. You wouldn't study law. You can't write a decent  letter. You don't know anything about the history of your country. What  can you do--?\"    \"I can ride and fight,\" he said. \"I can go to New Orleans to-morrow  to join Walker's Nicaragua expedition. We've got to beat the  Yankees,--they'll have Kansas away from us before we know it.\"    Virginia's eye flashed appreciation.    \"Do you remember, Jinny,\" he cried, \"one day long ago when those Dutch  ruffians were teasing you and Anne on the road, and Bert Russell and  Jack and I came along? We whipped 'em, Jinny. And my eye was closed.  And you were bathing it here, and one of my buttons was gone. And you  counted the rest.\"    \"Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief, doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief,\"  she recited, laughing. She crossed over and sat beside him, and her tone  changed. \"Max, can't you understand? It isn't that. Max, if you would  only work at something. That is why the Yankees beat us. If you would  learn to weld iron, or to build bridges, or railroads. Or if you would  learn business, and go to work in Pa's store.\"    \"You do not care for me as I am?\"    \"I knew that you did not understand,\" she answered passionately. \"It is  because I care for you that I wish to make you great. You care too much  for a good time, for horses, Max. You love the South, but you think too  little how she is to be saved. If war is to come, we shall want men like  that Captain Robert Lee who was here. A man who can turn the forces of  the earth to his own purposes.\"    For a moment Clarence was moodily silent.    \"I have always intended to go into politics, after Pa's example,\" he  said at length.    \"Then--\" began Virginia, and paused.    \"Then--?\" he said.    \"Then--you must study law.\"    He gave her the one keen look. And she met it, with her lips tightly  pressed together. Then he smiled.    \"Virginia, you will never forgive that Yankee, Brice.\"    \"I shall never forgive any Yankee,\" she retorted quickly. \"But we are  not talking about him. I am thinking of the South, and of you.\"    He stooped toward her face, but she avoided him and went back to the  bench.    \"Why not?\" he said.    \"You must prove first that you are a man,\" she said.    For years he remembered the scene. The vineyard, the yellow stubble; and  the river rushing on and on with tranquil power, and the slow panting of  the steamboat. A doe ran out of the forest, and paused, her head raised,  not twenty feet away.    \"And then you will marry me, Jinny?\" he asked finally.    \"Before you may hope to control another, we shall see whether you can  control yourself, sir.\"    \"But it has all been arranged,\" he exclaimed, \"since we played here  together years ago!\"    \"No one shall arrange that for me,\" replied Virginia promptly. \"And  I should think that you would wish to have some of the credit for  yourself.\"    \"Jinny!\"    Again she avoided him by leaping the low railing. The doe fled into the  forest, whistling fearfully. Virginia waved her hand to him and started  toward the house. At the corner of the porch she ran into her aunt Mrs.  Colfax was a beautiful woman. Beautiful when Addison Colfax married her  in Kentucky at nineteen, beautiful still at three and forty. This, I am  aware, is a bald statement. \"Prove it,\" you say. \"We do not believe it.  It was told you by some old beau who lives upon the memory of the past.\"    Ladies, a score of different daguerrotypes of Lillian Colfax are in  existence. And whatever may be said of portraits, daguerrotypes do not  flatter. All the town admitted that she was beautiful. All the town knew  that she was the daughter of old Judge Colfax's overseer at Halcyondale.  If she had not been beautiful, Addison Colfax would not have run away  with her. That is certain. He left her a rich widow at five and twenty,  mistress of the country place he had bought on the Bellefontaine Road,  near St. Louis. And when Mrs. Colfax was not dancing off to the Virginia  watering-places, Bellegarde was a gay house.    \"Jinny,\" exclaimed her aunt, \"how you scared me! What on earth is the  matter?\"    \"Nothing,\" said Virginia    \"She refused to kiss me,\" put in Clarence, half in play, half in  resentment.    Mrs. Colfax laughed musically. She put one of her white hands on each  of her niece's cheeks, kissed her, and then gazed into her face until  Virginia reddened.    \"Law, Jinny, you're quite pretty,\" said her aunt    \"I hadn't realized it--but you must take care of your complexion. You're  horribly sunburned, and you let your hair blow all over your face. It's  barbarous not to wear a mask when you ride. Your Pa doesn't look after  you properly. I would ask you to stay to the dance to-night if your  skin were only white, instead of red. You're old enough to know better,  Virginia. Mr. Vance was to have driven out for dinner. Have you seen  him, Clarence?\"    \"No, mother.\"    \"He is so amusing,\" Mrs. Colfax continued, \"and he generally brings  candy. I shall die of the blues before supper.\" She sat down with a  grand air at the head of the table, while Alfred took the lid from the  silver soup-tureen in front of her. \"Jinny, can't you say something  bright? Do I have to listen to Clarence's horse talk for another hour?  Tell me some gossip. Will you have some gumbo soup?\"    \"Why do you listen to Clarence's horse talk?\" said Virginia. \"Why don't  you make him go to work!\"    \"Mercy!\" said Mrs. Colfax, laughing, \"what could he do?\"    \"That's just it,\" said Virginia. \"He hasn't a serious interest in life.\"    Clarence looked sullen. And his mother, as usual, took his side.    \"What put that into your head, Jinny,\" she said. \"He has the place here  to look after, a very gentlemanly occupation. That's what they do in  Virginia.\"    \"Yes,\" said Virginia, scornfully, \"we're all gentlemen in the South.  What do we know about business and developing the resources of the  country? Not THAT.\"    \"You make my head ache, my dear,\" was her aunt's reply. \"Where did you  get all this?\"    \"You ask me because I am a girl,\" said Virginia. \"You believe that women  were made to look at, and to play with,--not to think. But if we are  going to get ahead of the Yankees, we shall have to think. It was all  very well to be a gentleman in the days of my great-grandfather. But now  we have railroads and steamboats. And who builds them? The Yankees. We  of the South think of our ancestors, and drift deeper and deeper into  debt. We know how to fight, and we know how to command. But we have  been ruined by--\" here she glanced at the retreating form of Alfred, and  lowered her voice, \"by niggers.\"    Mrs. Colfax's gaze rested languidly on her niece's faces which glowed  with indignation.    \"You get this terrible habit of argument from Comyn,\" she said. \"He  ought to send you to boarding-school. How mean of Mr. Vance not to come!  You've been talking with that old reprobate Whipple. Why does Comyn put  up with him?\"    \"He isn't an old reprobate,\" said Virginia, warmly.    \"You really ought to go to school,\" said her aunt. \"Don't be eccentric.  It isn't fashionable. I suppose you wish Clarence to go into a factory.\"    \"If I were a man,\" said Virginia, \"and going into a factory would teach  me how to make a locomotive or a cotton press, or to build a bridge, I  should go into a factory. We shall never beat the Yankees until we meet  them on their own ground."]]]
