In commenting on  the trial the following day, the Times stigmatised as \"feeble\" the  prevarications by which Mrs. Dyson tried to explain away her intimacy  with Peace. In this part of his cross-examination Mr. Lockwood had made  it appear at least highly probable that there had been a much closer  relationship between Mrs. Dyson and Peace than the former was willing to  acknowledge.    The evidence of Mrs. Dyson was followed by that of five persons who had  either seen Peace in the neighbourhood of Banner Cross Terrace on the  night of the murder, or heard the screams and shots that accompanied it.  A woman, Mrs. Gregory, whose house was between that of the Dysons and  the passage in which Dyson was shot, said that she had heard the noise  of the clogs Mrs. Dyson was wearing as she went across the yard. A  minute later she heard a scream. She opened her back door and saw Dyson  standing by his own. She told him to go to his wife. She then went back  into her house, and almost directly after heard two shots, followed by  another scream, but no sound as of any scuffling.    Another witness was a labourer named Brassington. He was a stranger to  Peace, but stated that about eight o'clock on the night of the murder  a man came up to him outside the Banner Cross Hotel, a few yards from  Dyson's house. He was standing under a gas lamp, and it was a bright  moonlight night. The man asked him if he knew of any strange people who  had come to live in the neighbourhood. Brassington answered that he  did not. The man then produced a bundle of letters which he asked  Brassington to read. But Brassington declined, as reading was not one of  his accomplishments. The man then said that \"he would make it a warm 'un  for those strange folks before morning--he would shoot both of them,\"  and went off in the direction of Dyson's house. Brassington swore  positively that Peace was the stranger who had accosted him that night,  and Mr. Lockwood failed to shake him in his evidence. Nor could Mr.  Lockwood persuade the surgeon who was called to Dyson at the time of his  death to admit that the marks on the nose and chin of the dead man  could have been caused by a blow; they were merely abrasions of the skin  caused by the wounded man falling to the ground.    Evidence was then given as to threats uttered by Peace against the  Dysons in the July of 1876, and as to his arrest at Blackheath in the  October of 1878. The revolver taken from Peace that night was produced,  and it was shown that the rifling of the bullet extracted from Dyson's  head was the same as that of the bullet fired from the revolver carried  by Peace at the time of his capture.    Mr. Campbell Foster wanted to put in as evidence the card that Dyson  had flung into Peace's garden at Darnall requesting him not to interfere  with his family. This card had been found among the bundle of letters  dropped by Peace near the scene of the murder. Mr. Lockwood objected to  the admission of the card unless all the letters were admitted at the  same time. The Judge ruled that both the card and the letters were  inadmissible, as irrelevant to the issue; Mr. Lockwood had, he said,  very properly cross-examined Mrs. Dyson on these letters to test her  credibility, but he was bound by her answers and could not contradict  her by introducing them as evidence in the case.    Mr. Lockwood in his address to the jury did his best to persuade them  that the death of Dyson was the accidental result of a struggle between  Peace and himself. He suggested that Mrs. Dyson had left her house that  night for the purpose of meeting Peace, and that Dyson, who was jealous  of his wife's intimacy with him, had gone out to find her; that Dyson,  seeing Peace, had caught hold of him; and that the revolver had gone  off accidentally as Dyson tried to wrest it from his adversary.  He repudiated the suggestion of Mr. Foster that the persons he had  confronted with Mrs. Dyson in the course of his cross-examination had  been hired for a paltry sum to come into court and lie.    Twice, both at the beginning and the end of his speech, Mr. Lockwood  urged as a reason for the jury being tender in taking Peace's life that  he was in such a state of wickedness as to be quite unprepared to meet  death. Both times that his counsel put forward this curious plea, Peace  raised his eyes to heaven and exclaimed \"I am not fit to die.\"    Mr. Justice Lopes in summing up described as an \"absolute surmise\" the  theory of the accidental discharge of the pistol. He asked the jury to  take Peace's revolver in their hands and try the trigger, so as to see  for themselves whether it was likely to go off accidentally or not. He  pointed out that the pistol produced might not have been the pistol used  at Banner Cross; at the same time the bullet fired in November, 1876,  bore marks such as would have been produced had it been fired from the  pistol taken from Peace at Blackheath in October, 1878. He said that Mr.  Lockwood had been perfectly justified in his attempt to discredit the  evidence of Mrs. Dyson, but the case did not rest on her evidence alone.  In her evidence as to the threats uttered by Peace in July, 1876, Mrs.  Dyson was corroborated by three other witnesses. In the Judge's opinion  it was clearly proved that no struggle or scuffle had taken place  before the murder. If the defence, he concluded, rested on no solid  foundation, then the jury must do their duty to the community at large  and by the oath they had sworn.    It was a quarter past seven when the jury retired. Ten minutes later  they came back into court with a verdict of guilty. Asked if he had  anything to say, Peace in a faint voice replied, \"It is no use my  saying anything.\" The Judge, declining very properly to aggravate the  prisoner's feelings by \"a recapitulation of any portion of the details  of what I fear, I can only call your criminal career,\" passed on him  sentence of death. Peace accepted his fate with composure.    Before we proceed to describe the last days of Peace on earth, let us  finish with the two women who had succeeded Mrs. Peace in his ardent  affections.    A few days after Peace's execution Mrs. Dyson left England for America,  but before going she left behind her a narrative intended to contradict  the imputations which she felt had been made against her moral  character. An Irishwoman by birth, she said that she had gone to America  when she was fifteen years old.    There she met and married Dyson, a civil engineer on the Atlantic and  Great Western Railway. Theirs was a rough and arduous life. But Mrs.  Dyson was thoroughly happy in driving her husband about in a buggy among  bears and creeks. She did not know fear and loved danger: \"My husband  loved me and I loved him, and in his company and in driving him about in  this wild kind of fashion I derived much pleasure.\" However, Mr. Dyson's  health broke down, and he was obliged to return to England. It was at  Darnall that the fatal acquaintance with Peace began. Living next  door but one to the Dysons, Peace took the opportunity of introducing  himself, and Mr. Dyson \"being a gentleman,\" took polite notice of his  advances. He became a constant visitor at the house. But after a time  Peace began to show that he was not the gentleman Mr. Dyson was. He  disgusted the latter by offering to show him improper pictures and \"the  sights of the town\" of Sheffield.    The Dysons tried to shake off the unwelcome acquaintance, but that was  easier said than done. By this time Peace had set his heart on making  Mrs. Dyson leave her husband. He kept trying to persuade her to go to  Manchester with him, where he would take a cigar or picture shop, to  which Mrs. Dyson, in fine clothes and jewelry, should lend the charm of  her comely presence. He offered her a sealskin jacket, yards of silk,  a gold watch. She should, he said, live in Manchester like a lady, to  which Mrs. Dyson replied coldly that she had always lived like one and  should continue to do so quite independently of him. But Peace would  listen to no refusal, however decided its tone. Dyson threw over  the card into Peace's garden. This only served to aggravate his  determination to possess himself of the wife. He would listen at  keyholes, leer in at the window, and follow Mrs. Dyson wherever she  went. When she was photographed at the fair, she found that Peace had  stood behind her chair and by that means got himself included in the  picture. At times he had threatened her with a revolver. On one occasion  when he was more insulting than usual, Mrs. Dyson forgot her fear of him  and gave him a thrashing. Peace threatened \"to make her so that neither  man nor woman should look at her, and then he would have her all to  himself.\" It was with some purpose of this kind, Mrs. Dyson suggested,  that Peace stole a photograph of herself out of a locket, intending to  make some improper use of it. At last, in desperation, the Dysons moved  to Banner Cross. From the day of their arrival there until the murder,  Mrs. Dyson never saw Peace. She denied altogether having been in his  company the night before the murder. The letters were \"bare forgeries,\"  written by Peace or members of his family to get her into their power.    Against the advice of all her friends Mrs. Dyson had come back from  America to give evidence against Peace. To the detective who saw her at  Cleveland she said, \"I will go back if I have to walk on my head all the  way\"; and though she little knew what she would have to go through in  giving her evidence, she would do it again under the circumstances. \"My"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#13)"],[1,"were we to attempt to study them in all their  complexity.    We have shown that man is influenced by different logics, which  under normal conditions exist in juxtaposition, without mutually  influencing one another.  Under the action of various events they  enter into mutual conflict, and the irreducible differences  which divide them are visibly manifested, involving considerable  individual and social upheavals.    Mystic logic, which we shall presently consider as it appears in  the Jacobin mind, plays a very important part.  But it is not  alone in its action.  The other forms of logic--affective logic,  collective logic, and rational logic--may predominate according  to circumstances.      2.  The Mystic Mentality.      Leaving aside for the moment the influence of affective,  rational, and collective logic, we will occupy ourselves solely  with the considerable part played by the mystic elements which  have prevailed in so many revolutions, and notably in the French  Revolution.    The chief characteristic of the mystic temperament consists in  the attribution of a mysterious power to superior beings or  forces, which are incarnated in the form of idols, fetiches,  words, or formulae.    The mystic spirit is at the bottom of all the religious and most  political beliefs.  These latter would often vanish could we  deprive them of the mystic elements which are their chief  support.    Grafted on the sentiments and passionate impulses which it  directs, mystic logic constitutes the might of the great popular  movements.  Men who would be by no means ready to allow  themselves to be killed for the best of reasons will readily  sacrifice their lives to a mystic ideal which has become an  object of adoration.    The principles of the Revolution speedily inspired a wave of  mystic enthusiasm analogous to those provoked by the various  religious beliefs which had preceded it.  All they did was to  change the orientation of a mental ancestry which the  centuries had solidified.    So there is nothing astonishing in the savage zeal of the men of  the Convention.  Their mystic mentality was the same as that of  the Protestants at the time of the Reformation.  The principal  heroes of the Terror--Couthon, Saint-Just, Robespierre, &c.--were  Apostles.  Like Polyeuctes, destroying the altars of the false  gods to propagate his faith, they dreamed of converting the  globe.  Their enthusiasm spilled itself over the earth.  Persuaded that their magnificent formulae were sufficient to  overturn thrones, they did not hesitate to declare war upon  kings.  And as a strong faith is always superior to a doubtful  faith, they victoriously faced all Europe.    The mystic spirit of the leaders of the Revolution was betrayed  in the least details of their public life.  Robespierre,  convinced that he was supported by the Almighty, assured his  hearers in a speech that the Supreme Being had ``decreed the  Republic since the beginning of time.''  In his quality of High  Pontiff of a State religion he made the Convention vote a decree  declaring that ``the French People recognises the existence of  the Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul.''  At the  festival of this Supreme Being, seated on a kind of throne, he  preached a lengthy sermon.    The Jacobin Club, directed by Robespierre, finally assumed all  the functions of a council.  There Maximilien proclaimed ``the  idea of a Great Being who watches over oppressed innocence and  who punishes triumphant crime.''    All the heretics who criticised the Jacobin orthodoxy were  excommunicated--that is, were sent to the Revolutionary Tribunal,  which they left only for the scaffold.    The mystic mentality of which Robespierre was the most celebrated  representative did not die with him.  Men of identical mentality  are to be found among the French politicians of to-day.  The old  religious beliefs no longer rule their minds, but they are the  creatures of political creeds which they would very soon force on  others, as did Robespierre, if they had the chance of so doing.  Always ready to kill if killing would spread their faith, the  mystics of all ages have employed the same means of persuasion as  soon as they have become the masters.    It is therefore quite natural that Robespierre should still have  many admirers.  Minds moulded like his are to be met with in  their thousands.  His conceptions were not guillotined with him.  Old as humanity, they will only disappear with the last believer.    This mystic aspect of all revolutions has escaped the majority of  the historians.  They will persist for a long time yet in trying  to explain by means of rational logic a host of phenomena which  have nothing to do with reason.  I have already cited a passage  from the history of MM. Lavisse and Rambaud, in which the  Reformation is explained as ``the result of the free individual  reflections suggested to simple folk by an extremely pious  conscience, and a bold and courageous reason.''    Such movements are never comprehended by those who imagine that  their origin is rational.  Political or religious, the beliefs  which have moved the world possess a common origin and  follow the same laws.  They are formed, not by the reason, but  more often contrary to reason.  Buddhism, Christianity, Islamism,  the Reformation, sorcery, Jacobinism, socialism, spiritualism,  &c., seem very different forms of belief, but they have, I  repeat, identical mystic and affective bases, and obey forms of  logic which have no affinity with rational logic.  Their might  resides precisely in the fact that reason has as little power to  create them as to transform them.    The mystic mentality of our modern political apostles is strongly  marked in an article dealing with one of our recent ministers,  which I cite from a leading journal:    ``One may ask into what category does M. A----fall?  Could we  say, for instance, that he belongs to the group of unbelievers?  Far from it!  Certainly M. A---- has not adopted any positive  faith; certainly he curses Rome and Geneva, rejecting all the  traditional dogmas and all the known Churches.  But if he makes a  clean sweep it is in order to found his own Church on the ground  so cleared, a Church more dogmatic than all the rest; and his own  inquisition, whose brutal intolerance would have no reason to  envy the most notorious of Torquemadas.    `` `We cannot,' he says, `allow such a thing as scholastic  neutrality.  We demand lay instruction in all its plenitude, and  are consequently the enemies of educational liberty.'  If he does  not suggest erecting the stake and the pyre, it is only on  account of the evolution of manners, which he is forced to take  into account to a certain extent, whether he will or no.  But,  not being able to commit men to the torture, he invokes the  secular arm to condemn their doctrines to death.  This is exactly  the point of view of the great inquisitors.  It is the same  attack upon thought.  This freethinker has so free a spirit that  every philosophy he does not accept appears to him, not only  ridiculous and grotesque, but criminal.  He flatters himself that  he alone is in possession of the absolute truth.  Of this he is  so entirely sure that everyone who contradicts him seems to him  an execrable monster and a public enemy.  He does not suspect for  a moment that after all his personal views are only hypotheses,  and that he is all the more laughable for claiming a Divine right  for them precisely because they deny divinity.  Or, at least,  they profess to do so; but they re-establish it in another shape,  which immediately makes one regret the old.  M. A---- is a  sectary of the goddess Reason, of whom he has made a Moloch, an  oppressive deity hungry for sacrifice.  No more liberty of  thought for any one except for himself and his friends; such is  the free thought of M. A----.  The outlook is truly attractive.  But perhaps too many idols have been cast down during the last  few centuries for men to bow before this one.''    We must hope for the sake of liberty that these gloomy fanatics  will never finally become our masters.    Given the silent power of reason over mystic beliefs, it is quite  useless to seek to discuss, as is so often done, the rational  value of revolutionary or political ideas.  Only their influence  can interest us.  It matters little that the theories of the  supposed equality of men, the original goodness of mankind, the  possibility of re-making society by means of laws, have  been given the lie by observation and experience.  These empty  illusions must be counted among the most potent motives of action  that humanity has known.      3.  The Jacobin Mentality.      Although the term ``Jacobin mentality'' does not really belong to  any true classification, I employ it here because it sums up a  clearly defined combination which constitutes a veritable  psychological species.    This mentality dominates the men of the French Revolution, but is  not peculiar to them, as it still represents one of the most  active elements in our politics.    The mystic mentality which we have already considered is an  essential factor of the Jacobin mind, but it is not in itself  enough to constitute that mind.  Other elements, which we shall  now examine, must be added.    The Jacobins do not in the least suspect their mysticism.  On the  contrary, they profess to be guided solely by pure reason.  During the Revolution they invoked reason incessantly, and  considered it as their only guide to conduct.    The majority of historians have adopted this rationalist  conception of the Jacobin mind, and Taine fell into the same  error.  It is in the abuse of rationalism that he seeks the  origin of a great proportion of the acts of the Jacobins.  The  pages in which he has dealt with the subject contain many truths,  however, and as they are in other ways very remarkable, I  reproduce the most important"]]]
