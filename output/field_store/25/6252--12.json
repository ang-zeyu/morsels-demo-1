After looking at them we went up many flights of most dangerously steep  stairs, almost in pitch darkness the whole time, until we came to a  small courtyard. Then after climbing up more steps, we were ushered into  a small latticed room where we were given the usual Tibetan tea and  sweetmeats. I presented the Jongpen with one of the new lever electric  torches, with which he was much pleased, saying it would be of much use  to him in going up and down his dark staircases. After tea he took us up  on to the roof of the fort, which was quite flat, and from which we had  a most magnificent view. We stood on the top of a great precipice and  looked straight down at our camp, which lay many hundred feet below but  almost within a stone's throw. From here too we could look across the  wide plains and valleys of the Yaru and its tributaries to the main  chain of the Himalayas which formed the Southern boundary to the  picture. From this side they do not appear nearly as imposing as they do  when seen from the South. Seen as they are from a height of over 15,000  feet, the distance to the sky line is not nearly so great, and as a rule  we found the Northern slopes to be much less steep than those on the  Southern side. The snow line, too, was also several thousand feet  higher. Every day great masses of moist cumulus clouds came rolling up  and round the peaks to the South of us, indicating heavy falls of rain  and snow on the South, but very little of this came over the  watershed--only an occasional slight hailstorm or a few drops of rain.  From this point we could see as far West as Mount Everest, still over a  hundred miles away. After spending some time up there and admiring and  discussing the view, we descended once more into the fort, where the  Jongpen showed us some of the carpets that his womenfolk were busy  making and promised to have some ready for us by the time that we came  back. We also much admired the curious old locks by which the doors and  boxes were fastened; before leaving, he made me a present of one of  these locks.      [3] Dzong means fort.    June 7 saw us still at Khamba Dzong, as the transport would not be ready  till the following day. Raeburn, who for some time had been suffering  from the same complaint as Dr. Kellas, was unfortunately getting no  better and was getting weaker every day. We were therefore reluctantly  compelled to send him back again into Sikkim to Lachen, where he could  be taken charge of by the lady missionaries and properly looked after.  Wollaston and Gyalzen Kazi were to accompany him down to Lachen, and if  possible to rejoin us by the time that we got to Tingri. This break-up  of our climbing party was most annoying and seriously weakened our  party, obliging us to alter our plans for reconnoitring in a thorough  manner the various approaches to Mount Everest. The following day, after  a good deal of delay and argument about the loads, we got everything  loaded up and started off for Lingga, a march of about 16 miles to the  West. For the first few miles we rode across a great plain on which were  several small herds of goa, but these were very wary and kept well out  of shot. The path then took us alongside a small isolated rocky hill in  which we kept putting up numerous hares who often got up right under our  ponies' feet. We crossed the Yaru River, now only a small stream, at the  picturesque village of Mende with its fine willow trees, and then after  passing over a spur, formed of slaty rock, we descended into another  great plain which extended all the way to Tingri. Five miles across this  plain was the village of Lingga, surrounded by marshes and ponds, with  barley fields and rich grass growing between the patches of water. There  were several other villages in sight, so that the plain was evidently  fertile and could support a considerable population. This was the first  place where we became bothered by sand flies, which in the morning were  very troublesome; but when the wind got up, as it always did in the  afternoons, it blew them away, and for once was welcome. The villagers  were very hospitable; they produced tea and beer brewed from barley for  us as soon as we arrived there. The latter is quite a pleasant drink on  a hot day, but it did not agree with my inside at all. The people here  had never seen a European before, and though at first inclined to be  rather shy, they soon became very friendly and curious. Some pieces of  silver paper from chocolates quite won the hearts of the children who  flocked around and did not in the least mind being photographed. To the  South extended the chain of snows of the main range of the Himalayas,  and on the way we had several clear and distinct views of Mount Everest.  Morshead, who had left the day before, was camped at a small monastery a  few miles to the North of us in order to follow the crest of the ridge  of hills and to survey both sides, but was to join us again at Tinki.  The weather now was really delightful, though to the South of us we  still saw heavy clouds which brought showers of snow as far as the  mountains, but they did not reach us.    From here to Tinki was about 13 miles over a perfectly level plain. The  midges or sand flies were very troublesome the whole way and came in  hundreds round one's head, got inside one's topee, and were thoroughly  objectionable. The plain appeared very fertile, as there seemed to be  plenty of water and great herds of yaks and flocks of sheep were grazing  upon it. In the marshes and ponds were many bar-headed geese, Brahminy  ducks, mallard and teal. After the rains, it is evident that a great  part of this plain is under water. About a couple of miles from Tinki we  crossed some curious sand dunes, about 20 feet high, which are evidently  on the move, and soon afterwards the Jongpen of Tinki came riding out to  meet us with a few mounted followers, he himself riding a fine white  pony. He was very Chinese in appearance, wearing finely embroidered  silks with a Chinese hat and a long pigtail, and his manners were  excellent. He escorted us to the place where our camp was to be, and had  had three or four tents already pitched for us. Tea and country beer  were at once served, and we rested in the shade of his Chinese tents  until our transport arrived.    [Illustration: TINKI DZONG.]    We were encamped in a very picturesque spot beside a large pond that was  full of bar-headed geese, Brahminy ducks and terns. On the opposite side  of this pond rose the walls and towers of the fort of Tinki. As soon as  we had settled down, the Jongpen came again to pay us a formal visit,  presented us with four sheep and a couple of hundred eggs and promised  to do everything he could to help us and to forward us on our way. Half  a mile above us was a large village and a big monastery belonging to the  Yellow Sect of Buddhists who also owned a fine grove of willows. The  bottom of the valley was all covered with barley fields, now a tender  green and coming up well. As the fresh transport had not arrived, we had  to spend the following day there. This gave an opportunity for Abdul  Jalil, our photographic assistant, to rejoin us. We had sent him back to  Phari in order to change some more rupees into Tibetan currency, as we  found that Indian notes or rupees were not accepted any further to the  West. Abdul Jalil had been very nervous about travelling with so much  money and had borrowed a revolver and a rifle from members of the  Expedition besides two large Tibetan swords and a dagger which he  obtained from the Jongpen. In the morning, with Bullock, I went to  return the call of the Jongpen. His fort at the time was under repair,  so he was living in a small house outside the main building. He was very  affable and gave us tea: we were then able to make all the arrangements  for transport except the actual fixing of the price. For this he said he  would have to consult his head-men. Just as we were about to leave he  insisted on our eating the large meal which he had had prepared for us.  He gave us small dishes of excellent macaroni and mince, seasoned up  with chillies and very well cooked--much better than anything our cooks  could produce. This we had to eat with chopsticks--a somewhat difficult  proceeding, as we were not yet used to them. Later on, however, after  much practice, we found no difficulty in consuming the numerous bowls of  this excellent dish that the Tibetans always set before one. The Jongpen  told us that he had been twenty-nine years in Government service, and he  was expecting to have a better post than this shortly. His health was  poor and he said he had been suffering much from indigestion, so I gave  him some pills and tabloids, for which he was very grateful. On the  return journey, he told me that he had greatly benefited by my  treatment. The bar-headed geese and the wild duck here were  extraordinarily tame, allowing us to approach within five yards of them  and showing no signs of fear. They would come and waddle round our  tents, picking up any scraps of food. The Jongpen had begged us not to  shoot or kill any of them, as he said a Lama had been sent specially  from Lhasa some years ago in order to tame the creatures, and certainly  the result was extraordinary; it was most interesting to watch these  birds, ordinarily so wild, from so close a distance. In the evening the  Jongpen came over to see us again, and after a good hour's bargaining  over the price of the transport, we finally reached a reasonable and  amicable agreement. Every evening, to the South of us, there were  constant flashes of lightning all along the horizon. In the morning I  woke up to the unusual sound of drops of rain, but this only lasted for  five minutes and then cleared up, though the sky remained clouded all  the morning. There was the usual"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39465"],[0,"Eleven Years in the Rocky Mountains and Life on the Frontier (#13)"],[1,"tribe most dreaded in the Rocky Mountains, and  went by the name of \"Bugs Boys,\" which rendered into good English, meant  \"the devil's own.\" They are now so well known that to mention their  characteristics seems like repeating a \"twice-told tale;\" but as they  will appear so often in this narrative, Irving's account of them as he  had it from Bonneville when he was fresh from the mountains, will, after  all, not be out of place. \"These savages,\" he says, \"are the most  dangerous banditti of the mountains, and the inveterate foe of the  trapper. They are Ishmaelites of the first order, always with weapon in  hand, ready for action. The young braves of the tribe, who are destitute  of property, go to war for booty; to gain horses, and acquire the means  of setting up a lodge, supporting a family, and entitling themselves to  a seat in the public councils. The veteran warriors fight merely for the  love of the thing, and the consequence which success gives them among  their people. They are capital horsemen, and are generally well mounted  on short, stout horses, similar to the prairie ponies, to be met with in  St. Louis. When on a war party, however, they go on foot, to enable them  to skulk through the country with greater secrecy; to keep in thickets  and ravines, and use more adroit subterfuges and stratagems. Their mode  of warfare is entirely by ambush, surprise, and sudden assaults in the  night time. If they succeed in causing a panic, they dash forward with  headlong fury; if the enemy is on the alert, and shows no signs of fear,  they become wary and deliberate in their movements.    \"Some of them are armed in the primitive style, with bows and arrows;  the greater part have American fusees, made after the fashion of those  of the Hudson's Bay Company. These they procure at the trading post of  the American Fur Company, on Maria's River, where they traffic their  peltries for arms, ammunition, clothing, and trinkets. They are  extremely fond of spirituous liquors and tobacco, for which nuisances  they are ready to exchange, not merely their guns and horses, but even  their wives and daughters. As they are a treacherous race, and have  cherished a lurking hostility to the whites, ever since one of their  tribe was killed by Mr. Lewis, the associate of General Clarke, in his  exploring expedition across the Rocky Mountains, the American Fur  Company is obliged constantly to keep at their post a garrison of sixty  or seventy men.\"    \"Under the general name of Blackfeet are comprehended several tribes,  such as the Surcies, the Peagans, the Blood Indians, and the Gros  Ventres of the Prairies, who roam about the Southern branches of the  Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers, together with some other tribes further  north. The bands infesting the Wind River Mountains, and the country  adjacent, at the time of which we are treating, were Gros Ventres _of  the Prairies_, which are not to be confounded with the Gros Ventres _of  the Missouri_, who keep about the _lower_ part of that river, and are  friendly to the white men.\"    \"This hostile band keeps about the head-waters of the Missouri, and  numbers about nine hundred fighting men. Once in the course of two or  three years they abandon their usual abodes and make a visit to the  Arapahoes of the Arkansas. Their route lies either through the Crow  country, and the Black Hills, or through the lands of the Nez Perces,  Flatheads, Bannacks, and Shoshonies. As they enjoy their favorite state  of hostility with all these tribes, their expeditions are prone to be  conducted in the most lawless and predatory style; nor do they hesitate  to extend their maraudings to any party of white men they meet with,  following their trail, hovering about their camps, waylaying and  dogging the caravans of the free traders, and murdering the solitary  trapper. The consequences are frequent and desperate fights between them  and the mountaineers, in the wild defiles and fastnesses of the Rocky  Mountains.\" Such were the Blackfeet at the period of which we are  writing; nor has their character changed at this day, as many of the  Montana miners know to their cost.          CHAPTER III.      1830. Sublette's camp commenced moving back to the east side of the  Rocky Mountains in October. Its course was up Henry's fork of the Snake  River, through the North Pass to Missouri Lake, in which rises the  Madison fork of the Missouri River. The beaver were very plenty on  Henry's fork, and our young trapper had great success in making up his  packs; having learned the art of setting his traps very readily. The  manner in which the trapper takes his game is as follows:--    He has an ordinary steel trap weighing five pounds, attached to a chain  five feet long, with a swivel and ring at the end, which plays round  what is called the _float_, a dry stick of wood, about six feet long.  The trapper wades out into the stream, which is shallow, and cuts with  his knife a bed for the trap, five or six inches under water. He then  takes the float out the whole length of the chain in the direction of  the centre of the stream, and drives it into the mud, so fast that the  beaver cannot draw it out; at the same time tying the other end by a  thong to the bank. A small stick or twig, dipped in musk or castor,  serves for bait, and is placed so as to hang directly above the trap,  which is now set. The trapper then throws water plentifully over the  adjacent bank to conceal any foot prints or scent by which the beaver  would be alarmed, and going to some distance wades out of the stream.    In setting a trap, several things are to be observed with care:--first,  that the trap is firmly fixed, and the proper distance from the  bank--for if the beaver can get on shore with the trap, he will cut off  his foot to escape: secondly, that the float is of dry wood, for should  it not be, the little animal will cut it off at a stroke, and swimming  with the trap to the middle of the dam, be drowned by its weight. In the  latter case, when the hunter visits his traps in the morning, he is  under the necessity of plunging into the water and swimming out to dive  for the missing trap, and his game. Should the morning be frosty and  chill, as it very frequently is in the mountains, diving for traps is  not the pleasantest exercise. In placing the bait, care must be taken to  fix it just where the beaver in reaching it will spring the trap. If the  bait-stick be placed high, the hind foot of the beaver will be caught:  if low, his fore foot.    The manner in which the beavers make their dam, and construct their  lodge, has long been reckoned among the wonders of the animal creation;  and while some observers have claimed for the little creature more  sagacity than it really possesses, its instinct is still sufficiently  wonderful. It is certainly true that it knows how to keep the water of a  stream to a certain level, by means of an obstruction; and that it cuts  down trees for the purpose of backing up the water by a dam. It is not  true, however, that it can always fell a tree in the direction required  for this purpose. The timber about a beaver dam is felled in all  directions; but as trees that grow near the water, generally lean  towards it, the tree, when cut, takes the proper direction by  gravitation alone. The beaver then proceeds to cut up the fallen timber  into lengths of about three feet, and to convey them to the spot where  the dam is to be situated, securing them in their places by means of mud  and stones. The work is commenced when the water is low, and carried on  as it rises, until it has attained the desired height. And not only is  it made of the requisite height and strength, but its shape is suited  exactly to the nature of the stream in which it is built. If the water  is sluggish the dam is straight; if rapid and turbulent, the barrier is  constructed of a convex form, the better to resist the action of the  water.    [Illustration: BEAVER-DAM.]    When the beavers have once commenced a dam, its extent and thickness are  continually augmented, not only by their labors, but by accidental  accumulations; thus accommodating itself to the size of the growing  community. At length, after a lapse of many years, the water being  spread over a considerable tract, and filled up by yearly accumulations  of drift-wood and earth, seeds take root in the new made ground, and the  old beaver-dams become green meadows, or thickets of cotton-wood and  willow.    The food on which the beaver subsists, is the bark of the young trees in  its neighborhood; and when laying up a winter store, the whole community  join in the labor of selecting, cutting up, and carrying the strips to  their store-houses under water. They do not, as some writers have  affirmed, when cutting wood for a dam strip off the bark and store it in  their lodges for winter consumption; but only carry under water the  stick with the bark on.         \"The beaver has two incisors and eight molars in each jaw; and       empty hollows where the canine teeth might be. The upper pair of       cutting teeth extend far into the jaw, with a curve of rather more       than a semicircle; and the lower pair of incisors form rather less       than a semicircle. Sometimes, one of these teeth gets broken and       then the opposite tooth continues growing until it forms a nearly       complete circle. The chewing muscle of the beaver is strengthened       by tendons in such a way as to give it great power. But more is       needed to enable the beaver to eat wood. The insalivation of the       dry food is provided for by the extraordinary size of the salivary       glands.         \"Now, every part of these instruments is of vital importance to the       beavers. The loss of an incisor involves the formation of an       obstructive circular tooth; deficiency of saliva renders the food       indigestible; and when old age comes and the enamel is worn"]]]
