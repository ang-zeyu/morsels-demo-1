I'm plumb sorry  for Man. We used to be pretty good friends--\" He stopped short, his face  contrite.    Val was looking away, and she was winking very fast. Also, her lips were  quivering unmistakably, though she was biting them to keep them steady.    Kent stared at her helplessly. \"Say! I never thought you'd mind a little  joshing,\" he said gently, when the silence was growing awkward. \"I ought to  be killed! You--you must get awful lonesome--\"    She turned her face toward him quickly, as if he were the first person  who had understood her blank loneliness. \"That,\" she told him, in an  odd, hesitating manner, \"atones for the--the 'joshing.' No one seems to  realize--\"    \"Why don't you get out and ride around, or do something beside stick right  here in this coulee like a--a cactus?\" he demanded, with a roughness that  somehow was grateful to her. \"I'll bet you haven't been a mile from the  ranch since Man brought you here. Why don't you go to town with him when  he goes? It'd be a whole lot better for you--for both of you. Have you got  acquainted with any of the women here yet? I'll gamble you haven't!\" He was  waving the handkerchief gently like a flag, to dry it.    Val watched him; she had never seen any one hold a handkerchief by the  corners and wave it up and down like that for quick drying, and the  expedient interested her, even while she was wondering if it was quite  proper for him to lecture her in that manner. His scolding was even more  confusing than his teasing.    \"I've been down to the river twice,\" she defended weakly, and was angry  with herself that she could not find words with which to quell him.    \"Really?\" He down at her indulgently. \"How did you ever manage to get so  far? It must be all of half a mile!\"    \"Oh, you're perfectly horrible!\" she flashed suddenly. \"I don't see how it  can possibly concern you whether I go anywhere or not.\"    \"It does, though. I'm a lot public-spirited. I hate to see taxes go up, and  every lunatic that goes to the asylum costs the State just that much more.  I don't know an easier recipe for going crazy than just to stay off alone  and think. It's a fright the way it gets sheep-herders, and such.\"    \"I'm _such_, I suppose!\"    Kent glanced at her, approved mentally of the color in her cheeks and the  angry light in her eyes, and laughed at her quite openly.    \"There's nothing like getting good and mad once in a while, to take  the kinks out of your brain,\" he observed. \"And there's nothing like  lonesomeness to put 'em in. A good fighting mad is what you need, now and  then; I'll have to put Man next, I guess. He's too mild.\"    \"No one could accuse you of that,\" she retorted, laughing a little in spite  of herself. \"If I were a man I should want to blacken your eyes--\" And she  blushed hotly at being betrayed into a personality which seemed to her  undignified, and, what was worse, unrefined. She turned her back squarely  toward him, started down the path, and remembered that she had not filled  the water bucket, and that without it she could not consistently return to  the house.    Kent interpreted her glance, went sliding down the steep bank and recovered  the pail; he was laughing to himself while he rinsed and filled it at the  spring, but he made no effort to explain his amusement. When he came back  to where she stood watching him, Val gave her head a slight downward tilt  to indicate her thanks, turned, and led the way back to the house without  a word. And he, following after, watched her slim figure swinging lightly  down the hill before him, and wondered vaguely what sort of a hell her life  was going to be, out here where everything was different from what she had  been accustomed to, and where she did not seem to \"fit into the scenery,\"  as he put it.    \"You ought to learn to ride horseback,\" he advised unexpectedly.    \"Pardon me--you ought to learn to wait until your advice is wanted,\" she  replied calmly, without turning her head. And she added, with a sort of  defiance: \"I do not feel the need of either society or diversion, I assure  you; I am perfectly contented.\"    \"That's real nice,\" he approved. \"There's nothing like being satisfied with  what's handed out to you.\" But, though he spoke with much unconcern, his  tone betrayed his skepticism.    The others had finished eating and were sitting upon their heels in the  shade of the house, smoking and talking in that desultory fashion common to  men just after a good meal. Two or three glanced rather curiously at Kent  and his companion, and he detected the covert smile on the scandal-hungry  face of Polycarp Jenks, and also the amused twist of Fred De Garmo's lips.  He went past them without a sign of understanding, set the water pail down  in its proper place upon a bench inside the kitchen door, tilted his hat  to Val, who happened to be looking toward him at that moment, and went out  again.    \"What's the hurry, Kenneth?\" quizzed Polycarp, when Kent started toward the  corral.    \"Follow my trail long enough and you'll find out--maybe,\" Kent snapped in  reply. He felt that the whole group was watching hum, and he knew that if  he looked back and caught another glimpse of Fred De Garmo's sneering face  he would feel compelled to strike it a blow. There would be no plausible  explanation, of course, and Kent was not by nature a trouble hunter; and so  he chose to ride away without his dinner.    While Polycarp was still wondering audibly what was the matter, Kent passed  the house on his gray, called \"So-long, Man,\" with scarcely a glance at his  host, and speedily became a dim figure in the smoke haze.    \"He must be runnin' away from you, Fred,\" Polycarp hinted, grinning  cunningly. \"What you done to him--hey?\"    Fred answered him with an unsatisfactory scowl. \"You sure would be wise, if  you found out everything you wanted to know,\" he said contemptuously, after  an appreciable Wait. \"I guess we better be moving along, Bill.\" He rose,  brushed off his trousers with a downward sweep of his hands, and strolled  toward the corrals, followed languidly by Bill Madison.    As if they had been waiting for a leader, the others rose also and prepared  to depart. Polycarp proceeded, in his usual laborious manner, to draw his  tobacco from his pocket, and pry off a corner.    \"Why don't you burn them guards now, Manley, while you got plenty of help?\"  he suggested, turning his slit-lidded eyes toward the kitchen door, where  Val appeared for an instant to reach the broom which stood outside.    \"Because I don't want to,\" snapped Manley: \"I've got plenty to do without  that.\"    \"Well, they ain't wide enough, nor long enough, and they don't run in the  right direction--if you ask me.\" Polycarp spat solemnly off to the right.    \"I don't ask you, as it happens.\" Manley turned and went into the home.    Polycarp looked quizzically at the closed door. \"He's mighty touchy about  them guards, for a feller that thinks they're all right--_he-he!_\" he  remarked, to no one in particular. \"Some of these days, by granny, he'll  wisht he'd took my advice!\"    Since no one gave him the slightest attention, Polycarp did not pursue the  subject further. Instead, with both ears open to catch all that was said,  he trailed after the others to the corral. It was a matter of instinct,  as well as principle, with Polycarp Jenks, to let no sentence, however  trivial, slip past his hearing and his memory.          CHAPTER VIII. THE PRAIRIE FIRE    A calamity expected, feared, and guarded against by a whole community does  sometimes occur, and with a suddenness which finds the victims unprepared  in spite of all their elaborate precautions. Compared with the importance  of saving the range from fire, it was but a trivial thing which took nearly  every man who dwelt in Lonesome Land to town on a certain day when the wind  blew free from out the west. They were weary of watching for the fire which  did not come licking through the prairie grass, and a special campaign  train bearing a prospective President of our United States was expected to  pass through Hope that afternoon.    Since all trains watered at the red tank by the creek, there would be a  five-minute stop, during which the prospective President would stand upon  the rear platform and deliver a three-minute address--a few gracious words  to tickle the self-esteem of his listeners--and would employ the other two  minutes in shaking the hand of every man, woman, and child who could reach  him before the train pulled out. There would be a cheer or two given as he  was borne away--and there would be something to talk about afterward in the  saloons. Scarce a man of then had ever seen a President, and it was worth  riding far to look upon a man who even hoped for so exalted a position.    Manley went because he intended to vote for the man, and called it an act  of loyalty to his party to greet the candidate; also because it took very  little, now that haying was over and work did not press, to start him down  the trail in the direction of Hope.    At the Blumenthall ranch no man save the cook remained at home, and he only  because he had a boil on his neck which sapped his interest in all things  else. Polycarp Jenks was in town by nine o'clock, and only one man remained  at the Wishbone. That man was Kent, and he stayed because, according to his  outraged companions, he was an ornery cuss, and his bump of patriotism was  a hollow in his skull. Kent had told them, one and all, that he wouldn't  ride twenty-five miles to shake hands with the Deity Himself--which,  however, is not a verbatim report of his statement. The prospective  President had not done anything so big, he said, that a man should want to  break his neck getting to town just "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8547"],[0,"Pirke Avot: The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (#13)"],[1,"h; the holy flesh never became putrid; no fly (10) was  seen in the slaughter-house; no unclean accident ever befell the  high-priest on the Day of Atonement; the rain never quenched the fire  of the wood-pile on the altar (11); neither did the wind overcome the  column of smoke that arose therefrom (12); nor was there ever found  any disqualifying defect in the omer (of new barley, offered on the  second day of Passover) or in the two loaves (the first fruits of the  wheat-harvest, offered on Pentecost) (13), or in the shewbread (14);  though the people stood closely pressed together, they found ample  space to prostrate themselves; never did serpent or scorpion injure  any one in Jerusalem; nor did any man ever say to his fellow, \"the  place is too strait for me (15) to lodge over night in Jerusalem.\"  9.  Ten things were created on the eve of Sabbath in the twilight (16):  the mouth of the earth (17); the mouth of the well (18); the mouth of  the ass (19); the rainbow (20); the manna (21); the rod (22); the  shamir (23); the shape of written characters; the writing, and the  tables of stone: some say, the destroying spirits also, and the  sepulchre of Moses (24), and the ram of Abraham our father (25); and  others say, tongs, also, made with tongs (26).          (1) The expression \"and God said\" occurs ten times in Genesis        I (verses 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24, 26 28, and 29).  Many        commentators count the opening phrase of this chapter, \"In the        beginning God created the heavens and the earth,\" as one of        the sayings, maintaining that the idea of saying is implied in        it.  Cf. Ps. XXXIII, 16.  According to the Rabbis, the wicked        destroy and the righteous preserve the world, and, since it        required ten sayings to create the world, the guilt of the        sinner and the righteousness of the just are emphasized more        than if it had been created merely by one word.          (2) The ten generations are Adam, Seth, Enosh, Kenan,        Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methusaleh, Lamech, and Noah.  The        period from Adam to Noah is known as the \"generation of the        flood\" (_dor ha-mabbul_).          (3) These are Shem, Arpachshad, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, Reu,        Serug, Nahor, Terah, and Abraham.  Noah's good deeds were        sufficient only to save himself and family, while Abraham's        were sufficient to sustain the whole world.          (4) These trials may be reckoned as follows: (1) his        migration, Gen. XII, 12; (2) the famine in Canaan, XII, 10;        (3) the seizing of Sarah by Pharaoh, XII, 15; (4) the battle        with the four kings, XIV; (5) his marriage with Hagar because        of Sarah's sterility, XVI, 2; (6) the circumcision, XVII, 10;        (7) the seizing of Sarah by Abimelech, king of Gerar, XX, 2;        (8) the banishment of Hagar, XXI, 10; (9) the banishment of        Ishmael, XXI, 10; and (10) God's command to sacrifice Isaac,        XXII, 2.

Some interpreters explain this, however, as \"the        love of God for Abraham.\"          (6) That they escaped the ten plagues with which the Egyptians        were afflicted.          (7) Legend says that at the passage of the Red Sea the ten        miracles wrought were as follows: (1) the waters divided; (2)        the waters were like a tent, or a vault; (3) the sea-bed was        dry and hard; (4) but when the Egyptians trod upon it, it        became muddy and slimy; (5) the sea was divided into twelve        parts, one for each tribe; (6) the waters became as hard as        stone; (7) the congealed waters appeared like blocks of        building-stone; (8) the water was transparent so that the        tribes could see one another; (9) fresh drinking water flowed        from the congealed water; (10) after Israel had partaken of        the drinking water, it became congealed, and did not wet the        ground under foot.  See Ginzberg, _Legends of the Jews_, III,        p. 21 _et seq._          (8) This verse is not found in the Talmudic versions of        _Abot_.  The plagues at the sea are alluded to in the \"Song of        Moses,\" Ex. XV.  See the commentary of Bartenora.          (9) Num. XIV, 22.  The ten are enumerated by Maimonides,        Bartenora, Hoffmann, and others.          (10) The fly is a symbol of impurity.

XXIII, 15-17.          (14) Every Sabbath, twelve loaves of bread were placed on a        table in the Sanctuary \"before the Lord\" (Lev. XXIV, 5-9) to        serve as a constant reminder to the twelve tribes that their        place was before the altar of God.          (15) Isa. XLIX, 20.          (16) Since all things were said to have been created during        the first six days of creation, and since \"there is nothing        new under the sun\" (Eccles. I, 9), everything miraculous or        supernatural that existed or occurred after creation was        explained by the Rabbis as having been made or preordained in        the twilight at the moment of transition between the end of        the work of creation and the beginning of the Sabbath.

(26) An allusion to a saying found in _Tosefta Erubin_, \"Tongs        are made with tongs; but how was the first pair made?  It        could only have been a creation of God.\"  One instrument        presupposes another; one thing is the cause of another, but        the original cause is God.  Cf. _Pesachim_, 54a.    10. There are seven marks of an uncultured, and seven of a wise man.  The wise man does not speak before him who is greater than he in  wisdom; and does not interrupt the speech of his companion; he is not  hasty to answer; he questions according to the subject-matter; and  answers to the point; he speaks upon the first thing first, and upon  the last, last; regarding that which he has not understood he says, \"I  do not understand it;\" and he acknowledges the truth.  The reverse of  all this is to be found in an uncultured man.  11. Seven kinds of  punishment come into the world for seven important transgressions.  If  some give their tithes (27) and others do not, a dearth ensues from  drought and some suffer hunger while others are full.  If they all  determine to give no tithes, a dearth ensures from tumult (28) and  drought.  If they further resolve not to give the dough-cake (29), an  exterminating dearth ensures.  Pestilence comes into the world to  fulfil those death penalties threatened in the _Torah_, the execution  of which, however, is within the function of a human tribunal (30),  and for the violation of the law regarding the fruits of the seventh  year (31).  The sword (32) comes into the world for the delay of  justice, and for the perversion of justice, and on account of the  offence of those who interpret the _Torah_, not according to its true  sense (33).  Noxious beasts come into the world for vain swearing  (34), and for the profanation of the Divine Name (35).  Captivity  comes into the world on account of idolatry, immortality, bloodshed,  and the neglect of the year of rest for the soil (31).  12. At four  periods pestilence grows apace: in the fourth year, in the seventh, at  the conclusion of the seventh year, and at the conclusion of the Feast  of Tabernacles in each year: in the fourth year, for default of giving  the tithe to the poor in the third year (36); in the seventh year, for  default of giving the title to the poor in the sixth year (37); at the  conclusion of the seventh year, for the violation of the law regarding  the fruits of the seventh year (31), and at the conclusion of the  Feast of Tabernacles in each year, for robbing the poor of the grants  legally assigned to them (38).          (27) See chapter I, n. 37.          (28) Of war, when agriculture is neglected, and crops are        destroyed, etc.          (29) Num. XV, 20: \"Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of        your dough for a heave offering.\"  This commandment is        observed in spirit to-day by the Jewish housewife, who takes a        part of bread which is kneaded, and burns it, after reciting        the blessing, \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the        universe, Who has sanctified us by Thy commandments, and        commanded us to separate the _challah_.\"  The ninth treatise        of the _Order Zeraim_ of the _Mishnah_ is called _Challah._        See Friedlander, _Jewish Religion_, p. 357.
