At day-break, on the 1st of November, they counted no  less than five and forty canoes that were coming from the shore  towards the Endeavour; and these were followed by several more from  another place. Some of the Indians traded fairly; but others of them  took what was handed down to them without making any return, and added  derision to fraud. The insolence of one of them was very remarkable.  Some linen hanging over the ship's side to dry, this man without any  ceremony untied it, and put it up in his bundle. Being immediately  called to, and required to return it, instead of doing so, he let his  canoe drop astern, and laughed at the English. A musket which was  fired over his head, did not put a stop to his mirth. From a second  musket, which was loaded with small shot, he shrunk a little, when the  shot struck him upon his back; but he regarded it no more than one of  our men would have done the stroke of a rattan, and continued with  great composure to pack up the linen which he hard stolen. All the  canoes now dropped astern, and set up their song of defiance, which  lasted till they were at about four hundred yards' distance from the  ship. As they did not appear to have a design of attacking our  voyagers, Lieutenant Cook was unwilling to do them any hurt; and yet  he thought that their going off in a bravado might have a bad effect  when it should be reported on shore. To convince them therefore, that  they were still in his power, though far beyond the reach of any  missile weapon with which they were acquainted, he ordered a four  pounder to be fired in such a manner as to pass near them. As the shot  happened to strike the water, and to rise several times at a great  distance beyond the canoes, the Indians were so much terrified, that  without once looking behind them, they paddled away as fast as they  were able.    In standing westward from a small island called Mowtohora, the  Endeavour suddenly shoaled her water front seventeen to ten fathom. As  the lieutenant knew that she was not far off from some small islands  and rocks, which lead been seen before it was dark, and which he had  intended to have passed that evening, he thought it more prudent to  tack, and to spend the night under Mowtohora, where he was certain  that there was no danger. It was happy for himself, and for all our  voyagers, that he formed this resolution. In the morning they  discovered ahead of them several rocks, some of which were level with  the surface of the water, and some below it; and the striking against  which could not in the hour of darkness, have been avoided. In passing  between these rocks and the main, the ship had only from ten to seven  fathom water.    While Mr. Cook was near an island which he called the Mayor, the  inhabitants of the neighbouring coast displayed many instances of  hostility, and, in their traffic with our navigators, committed  various acts of fraud and robbery. As the lieutenant intended to  continue in the place five or six days, in order to make an  observation of the transit of Mercury, it was absolutely necessary for  the prevention of future mischief, to convince these people that the  English were not to be ill treated with impunity. Accordingly, some  small shot were fired at a thief of uncommon insolence, and a musket  ball was discharged through the bottom of his boat. Upon this it was  paddled to about a hundred yards' distance; and to the surprise of Mr.  Cook and his friends, the Indians in the other canoes took not the  least notice of their wounded companion, though he bled very much, but  returned to the ship, and continued to trade with the most perfect  indifference and unconcern. For a considerable time they dealt fairly.  At last, however, one of them thought fit to move off with two  different pieces of cloth which had been given for the same weapon.  When he had gotten to such a distance, that he thought himself secure  of his prizes, a musket was fired after him, which fortunately struck  the boat just at the water's edge, and made two holes in her side.  This excited such an alarm, that not only the people who were shot at,  but all the rest of the canoes, made off with the utmost expedition.  As the last proof of superiority, our commander ordered a round shot  to be fired over them, and not a boat stopped till they got to land.    After an early breakfast on the 9th of November, Lieutenant Cook went  on shore, with Mr. Green, and proper instruments, to observe the  transit of Mercury. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were of the party. The  weather had for some time been very thick, with much rain; but this  day proved so favourable, that not a cloud intervened during the whole  transit. The observation of the ingress was made by Mr. Green alone,  Mr. Cook being employed in taking the Sun's altitude to ascertain the  time.    While the gentlemen were thus engaged on shore, they were alarmed by  the firing of a great gun from the ship: and on their return received  the following account of the transaction from Mr. Gore, the second  lieutenant, who had been left commanding officer on board. During the  carrying on of a trade with some small canoes, two very large ones  came up full of men. In one of the canoes were forty-seven persons,  all of whom were armed with pikes, stones, and darts, and assumed the  appearance of a hostile intention. However, after a little time they  began to traffic, some of them offering their arms, and one of them a  square piece of cloth, which makes a part of their dress, called  _haabow_. Mr. Gore having agreed for it, sent down the price,  which was a piece of British cloth, and expected his purchase. But as  soon as the Indian had gotten Mr. Gore's cloth in his possession, he  refused to part with his own, and put off his canoe. Upon being  threatened for his fraud, he and his companions began to sing their  war song in defiance, and shook their paddles. Though their insolence  did not proceed to an attack, and only defied Mr. Gore to take any  remedy in his power, he was so provoked, that he levelled a musket,  loaded with ball, at the offender, while he was holding the cloth in  his hand, and shot him dead. When the Indian fell, all the canoes put  off to some distance, but continued to keep together in such a manner  that it was apprehended they might still meditate an attack. To secure  therefore a safe passage for the boat of the Endeavour, which was  wanted on shore, a round shot was fired with so much effect over  their heads, as to make them all flee with the utmost precipitation.  It was matter of regret to Lieutenant Cook that Mr. Gore had not, in  the case of the offending Indian, tried the experiment of a few small  shot, which had been successful in former instances of robbery.    On Friday, the 10th, our commander, accompanied by Mr. Banks and the  other gentlemen, went with two boats, to examine a large river that  empties itself into the head of Mercury Bay. As the situation they  were now in abounded with conveniences, the lieutenant has taken care  to point them out, for the benefit of future navigators. If any  occasion should ever render it necessary for a ship either to winter  here, or to stay for a considerable length of time, tents might be  built on a high point or peninsula in this place, upon ground  sufficiently spacious for the purpose; and they might easily be made  impregnable to the whole force of the country. Indeed the most skilful  engineer in Europe could not choose a situation better adapted to  enable a small number to defend themselves against a greater. Among  other accommodations which the Endeavour's company met with in Mercury  Bay, they derived an agreeable refreshment from some oyster beds,  which they had fortunately discovered. The oysters, which were as good  as ever came from Colchester, and about the same size, were so  plentiful, that not the boat only, but the ship itself, might have  been loaded in one tide.    On Wednesday, the 15th, Lieutenant Cook sailed out of Mercury Bay.  This name has been given to it, on account of the observation which  had there been made of the transit of that planet over the sun. The  river where oysters had been so plentifully found, he called Oyster  River. There is another river, at the head of the Bay, which is the  best and safest place for a ship that wants to stay any length of  time. From the number of mangroves about it, the lieutenant named it  Mangrove River. In several parts of Mercury Bay, our voyagers saw,  thrown upon the shore, great quantities of iron sand, which is brought  down by every little rivulet of freshwater that finds its way from the  country. This is a demonstration, that there is ore of that metal not  far inland; and yet none of the inhabitants of New Zealand, who had  yet been seen, knew the use of iron, or set upon it the least degree  of value. They had all of them preferred the most worthless and  useless trifle not only to a nail, but to any tool of that metal.  Before the Endeavour left the bay, the ship's name and that of the  commander were cut upon one of the trees near the watering place,  together with the date of the year and month when our navigators were  there. Besides this, Mr. Cook, after displaying the English colours  took formal possession of the place in the name of his Britannic  Majesty, King George the Third.    In the range from Mercury Bay, several canoes, on the 18th, put off  from different places, and advanced towards the Endeavour. When two of  them, in which there might be about sixty men, came within the reach  of the human voice, the Indians sung their war song, but seeing that  little notice was taken of them, they threw a few stones at the  English, and then rowed off towards the shore. In a short time,  however, they returned, as if with a fixed resolution to provoke our  voyagers to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#13)"],[1,"pli multe en aprilo, tamen post  la pluvo la herbo sxajnas pli verda, kaj la nuboj baldaux forflugas de  la blua cxielo.

LESSON XIX.                           \"JU\" AND \"DES\" IN COMPARISONS.    84. In clauses expressing a comparison between two objects, acts or  states, the adverbial use of English \"the ... the ...\" (meaning \"by how  much ... by that much ...\") is rendered by the adverbs \"ju\" and \"des\",  respectively:         Ju pli bona li estas, des pli felicxa li estos,     the better he is, the happier he will be.     Ju pli ofte mi rigardas, des pli mi volas rigardi,     the oftener I look, the more I wish to look.     Ju pli bele la luno brilas, des pli oni sxatas la nokton,       the more beautifully the moon shines, the more one likes the night.     Ju malpli pluvas, des pli la floroj velkas,       the less it rains, the more the flowers wither.     Ju malpli multe vi helpas, des malpli multe mi lauxdos vin,       the less you help, the less I shall praise you.     Cxar vi helpis, mi des pli multe lauxdos vin,       because you helped, I shall praise you the (that much) more.    [Footnote: Cf. Shakespeare, As You Like It, V, II, 49, \"By so much the  more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I  shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.\"]                              THE PREPOSITION \"INTER\".    85. In English, the preposition \"between\" is used in reference to two  persons or things, and \"among\" in reference to three or more. As the  difference in meaning is not essential, Esperanto has but the one  preposition inter to express both \"between\" and \"among\":       Li sidas inter vi kaj mi, he is sitting between you and me.     Li sidas inter siaj amikoj, he is sitting among his friends.     La monato majo estas inter aprilo kaj junio,        the month of May is between April and June.     Inter tiuj libroj estas tre interesa libro,        among those books there is a very interesting book.                               THE PREPOSITION \"PRO\".    86. Cause or reason may be expressed not only by an adverb (78) or a  clause (83), but also by use of the preposition \"pro\", because of, on  account of, for the sake of, for. It directs the thought away from the  complement toward the action, feeling or state caused by it, or done in  its interest or behalf:       La floroj velkas pro la seka vetero,        the flowers wilt because of the dry weather.     Mi skribis la leteron pro vi,        I wrote the letter for you (for your sake).     Pro tiuj nuboj mi timas ke pluvos,        on account of those clouds I fear that it will rain.     Oni sxatas cxerizojn pro la dolcxa gusto,        people like cherries because of the sweet taste.                 PREPOSITIONS WITH ADVERBS AND OTHER PREPOSITIONS.    87. Prepositions may be used with adverbs or with prepositional phrases  when the meaning permits:       La kato kuris el sub la tablo, the cat ran out-from under the table.     Li venos el tie, he will come out of there.     De nun li estos zorga, from now he will be careful.     Li staris dekstre de la vojo, he stood on the right of the road.     Mi iros for de cxi tie, I shall go away from here.                                     VOCABULARY       auxtuno = autumn, fall.            negxo = snow.     decembro = December.               novembro = November.     des = (see 84).                    nuda = bare, naked.     februaro = February.               oktobro = October.     glacio = ice.                      pro = because of (86).     inter = between, among (85).       rikolti = to harvest.     januaro = January.                 rivero = river.     ju = (see 84).                     septembro = September.     kovri = to cover.                  tero = ground, earth.                           LA AUXTUNO KAJ LA VINTRO.    La sezonoj de la jaro estas la vintro, la printempo, la somero, kaj la  auxtuno. La auxtuno estas inter la somero kaj la vintro. Gxiaj monatoj  estas septembro, oktobro kaj novembro. En septembro oni povas kolekti  maturajn fruktojn. Tiam ankaux oni rikoltas la flavan grenon de la  kampoj. Dum cxi tiu monato kaj dum oktobro la folioj sur la brancxoj  komencas esti rugxaj kaj flavaj, anstataux verdaj. La herbo velkas, kaj  bruna tapisxo sxajnas kovri la teron. Baldaux la folioj falas al la  tero, kaj en novembro la arboj estas tute nudaj. Pli aux malpli frue  negxas. La glacio ofte kovras la akvon en la riveroj, kaj restas sur la  stratoj kaj la vojoj. La mola blanka negxo kovras la teron, kaj kusxas  sur la brancxoj de la arboj. Tiam, pro la fortaj ventoj, gxi falas de  la brancxoj al la tero. La birdoj frue lasas tian veteron, kaj flugas  de cxi tie al pli sudaj kampoj kaj arboj. Ili ne povas resti, pro la  malvarmaj tagoj kaj noktoj. Ili malsxatas la negxon kaj la glacion pli  multe ol ni. Ju pli multe negxas; des pli malofte ni volas promeni. Ni  preferas resti en la domo, anstataux ekster gxi. Ju pli ni rigardas la  nudajn brancxojn de la arboj, des pli malagrabla sxajnas la vintro.  Tamen la junaj infanoj tre sxatas tian veteron, kaj ju pli negxas, kaj  ju pli forte la norda vento blovas, des malpli ili estas kontentaj en  la domo. Ili volas kuri sur la negxo, cxirkaux la arboj kaj inter ili,  kun siaj junaj amikoj. Ili povas bone amuzi sin per la negxo. La monatoj  de la vintro estas decembro, januaro kaj februaro. Gxi estas la plej  malvarma sezono.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. September, October and November are the months of autumn. 2. In these  months, people harvest the yellow grain and gather various fruits. 3.  The leaves on the trees around us begin to have red and yellow colors.  4. They begin to fall from the branches and lie upon the ground. 5. The  more strongly the cold north wind blows through the branches, the sooner  the leaves fall from there. 6.

The demonstrative adverb of manner and degree, related to the  demonstrative pronoun \"tiu\", is \"tiel\", in that (this) manner, in  such a way, thus, so. Like English \"thus,\" \"so,\" \"tiel\" may modify  adjectives and other adverbs, by indicating degree:       Cxu oni tiel helpas amikon?        Does one help a friend in that (this) way?     Mi gxin skribis tiel, I wrote it thus (in such a way).     La vetero estas tiel bela, the weather is so beautiful.     Tiel mallonge li parolis, thus briefly he spoke.     Mi trovis tiel belan floron, I found such a beautiful flower.     Li prenis tiel multe, he took that much (so much).                      PREPOSITIONS EXPRESSING TIME-RELATIONS.    89. The relations which prepositions express may be of various kinds.  As in English, a certain number of prepositions primarily expressing  place may also express time-relations. Such prepositions are \"antaux\",  \"cxirkaux\", \"de\", \"en\", \"gxis\", \"inter\", \"post\", and \"je\" (whose use in  other than time-relations will be explained later):       Mi foriros cxirkaux junio, I shall depart about June.     De tiu horo mi estis via amiko, from that hour I was your friend.     Li ne parolis al mi de tiu semajno,        he"]]]
