It  is, I now perceive, the Lens which makes this full accord possible, and  it is basically about the Lens that you are here?\"    \"It is,\" and Samms went on to cover in flashing thoughts his  conception of what the Galactic Patrol should be and should become.  That was easy enough; but when he tried to describe in detail the  qualifications necessary for Lensmanship, he began to bog down. \"Force,  drive, scope, of course ... range ... power ... but above all, an  absolute integrity ... an ultimate incorruptibility....\" He could  recognize such a mind after meeting it and studying it, but as to  finding it ... It might not be in any place of power or authority. His  own, and Rod Kinnison's, happened to be; but Costigan's was not ... and  both Knobos and DalNalten had made inconspicuousness a fine art....    \"I see,\" the native stated, when it became clear that Samms could say  no more. \"It is evident, of course, that I cannot qualify; nor do I  know anyone personally who can. However....\"    \"What?\" Samms demanded. \"I was sure, from the feel of your mind, that  you ... but with a mind of such depth and breadth, such tremendous  scope and power, you must be incorruptible!\"    \"I am,\" came the dry rejoinder. \"We all are. No Rigellian is, or ever  will be or can be, what you think of as 'corrupt' or 'corruptible'.  Indeed, it is only by the narrowest, most intense concentration upon  every line of your thought that I can translate your meaning into a  concept possible for any of us even to understand.\"    \"Then what ... Oh, I see. I was starting at the wrong end. Naturally  enough, I suppose, I looked first for the qualities rarest in my own  race.\"    \"Of course. Our minds have ample scope and range; and, perhaps,  sufficient power. But those qualities which you refer to as 'force'  and 'drive' are fully as rare among us as absolute mental integrity is  among you. What you know as 'crime' is unknown. We have no police, no  government, no laws, no organized armed forces of any kind. We take,  practically always, the line of least resistance. We live and let live,  as your thought runs. We work together for the common good.\"    \"Well ... I don't know what I expected to find here, but certainly not  this....\" If Samms had never before been completely thunderstruck,  completely at a loss, he was then. \"You don't think, then, that there  is any chance?\"    \"I have been thinking, and there may be a chance ... a slight one,  but still a chance,\" the Rigellian said, slowly. \"For instance, that  youth, so full of curiosity, who first visited your planet. Thousands  of us have wondered, to ourselves and to each other, about the  peculiar qualities of mind which compelled him and others to waste  so much time, effort, and wealth upon a project so completely useless  as exploration. Why, he had even to develop energies and engines  theretofore unknown, and which can never be of any real use!\"    Samms was shaken by the calm finality with which the Rigellian  dismissed all possibility of the usefulness of inter-stellar  exploration, but stuck doggedly to his purpose.    \"However slight the chance, I must find and talk to this man. I suppose  he is now out in deep space somewhere. Have you any idea where?\"    \"He is now in his home city, accumulating funds and manufacturing fuel  with which to continue his pointless activities. That city is named ...  that is, in your English you might call it ... Suntown? Sunberg? No, it  must be more specific ... Rigelsville? Rigel City?\"    \"Rigelston, I would translate it?\" Samms hazarded.    \"Exactly--Rigelston.\" The professor marked its location upon a globular  mental map far more accurate and far more detailed than the globe which  Captain Winfield and his lieutenant were then studying.    \"Thanks. Now, can you and will you get in touch with this explorer and  ask him to call a meeting of his full crew and any others who might be  interested in the project I have outlined?\"    \"I can. I will. He and his kind are not quite sane, of course, as  you know; but I do not believe that even they are so insane as to be  willing to subject themselves to the environment of your vessel.\"    \"They will not be asked to come here. The meeting will be held in  Rigelston. If necessary, I shall insist that it be held there.\"    \"You would? I perceive that you would. It is strange ... yes,  fantastic ... you are quarrelsome, pugnacious, anti-social, vicious,  small-bodied and small-brained; timid, nervous, and highly and  senselessly excitable; unbalanced and unsane; as sheerly monstrous  mentally as you are physically....\" These outrageous thoughts were sent  as casually and as impersonally as though the sender were discussing  the weather. He paused, then went on: \"And yet, to further such a  completely visionary project, you are eager to subject yourself to  conditions whose counterparts I could not force myself, under any  circumstances whatever, to meet. It may be ... it must be true that  there is an extension of the principle of working together for the  common good which my mind, for lack of pertinent data, has not been  able to grasp. I am now en rapport with Dronvire the explorer.\"    \"Ask him, please, not to identify himself to me. I do not want to go  into that meeting with any preconceived ideas.\"    \"A balanced thought,\" the Rigellian approved. \"Someone will be at the  airport to point out to you the already desolated area in which the  space-ship of the explorers makes its so-frightful landings; Dronvire  will ask someone to meet you at the airport and bring you to the place  of meeting.\"    The telepathic line snapped and Samms turned a white and sweating face  to the _Chicago's_ captain.    \"God, what a strain! Don't ever try telepathy unless you positively  have to--especially not with such an outlandishly _different_ race as  these Rigellians are!\"    \"Don't worry; I won't.\" Winfield's words were not at all sympathetic,  but his tone was. \"You looked as though somebody was beating your  brains out with a spiked club. Where next, First Lensman?\"    Samms marked the location of Rigelston upon the vessel's chart, then  donned ear-plugs and a special, radiation-proof suit of armor, equipped  with refrigerators and with extra-thick blocks of lead glass to protect  the eyes.    The airport, an extremely busy one well outside the city proper, was  located easily enough, as was the spot upon which the Tellurian ship  was to land. Lightly, slowly, she settled downward, her jets raving  out against a gravity fully twice that of her native Earth. Those  blasts, however, added little or nothing to the destruction already  accomplished by the craft then lying there--a torpedo-shaped cruiser  having perhaps one-twentieth of the _Chicago's_ mass and bulk.    The superdreadnaught landed, sinking into the hard, dry ground to a  depth of some ten or fifteen feet before she stopped. Samms, en rapport  with the entity who was to be his escort, made a flashing survey of the  mind so intimately in contact with his own. No use. This one was not  and never could become Lensman material. He climbed heavily down the  ladder. This double-normal gravity made the going a bit difficult, but  he could stand that a lot better than some of the other things he was  going to have to take. The Rigellian equivalent of an automobile was  there, waiting for him, its door invitingly open.    Samms had known--in general--what to expect. The two-wheeled chassis  was more or less similar to that of his own Dillingham. The body  was a narrow torpedo of steel, bluntly pointed at both ends, and  without windows. Two features, however, were both unexpected and  unpleasant--the hard, tough steel of which that body was forged  was an inch and a half thick, instead of one-sixteenth; and even  that extraordinarily armored body was dented and scarred and marred,  especially about the fore and rear quarters, as deeply and as badly and  as casually as are the fenders of an Earthly jalopy!    The Lensman climbed, not easily or joyously, into that grimly  forbidding black interior. Black? It was so black that the  port-hole-like doorway seemed to admit no light at all. It was blacker  than a witch's cat in a coal cellar at midnight! Samms flinched; then,  stiffening, thought at the driver.    \"My contact with you seems to have slipped. I'm afraid that I will  have to cling to you rather more tightly than may be either polite or  comfortable. Deprived of sight, and without your sense of perception, I  am practically helpless.\"    \"Come in, Lensman, by all means. I offered to maintain full  engagement, but it seemed to me that you declined it; quite possibly  the misunderstanding was due to our unfamiliarity with each others'  customary mode of thought. Relax, please, and come in ... there!  Better?\"    \"Infinitely better. Thanks.\"    And it was. The darkness vanished; through the unexplainable perceptive  sense of the Rigellian he could \"see\" everything--he had a practically  perfect three-dimensional view of the entire circumambient sphere. He  could see both the inside and the outside of the ground car he was in  and of the immense space-ship in which he had come to Rigel IV. He  could see the bearings and the wrist-pins of the internal-combustion  engine of the car, the interior structure of the welds that held the  steel plates together, the busy airport outside, and even deep into  the ground. He could see and study in detail the deepest-buried, most  heavily shielded parts of the atomic engines of the _Chicago_.    But he was wasting time. He could also plainly see a deeply-cushioned  chair, designed to fit a human body, welded to a stanchion and equipped  with half a dozen padded restraining straps. He sat down quickly;  strapped himself in.    \"Ready?\"    \"Ready.\"    The door banged shut with a clangor which burst through space-suit and  ear-plug"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4962"],[0,"The Story of Germ Life (#13)"],[1,"without such  additions, it is a method that is decidedly inferior to that which  first pasteurizes the cream and subsequently adds a starter.    There is still another method of adding bacteria to cream to  insure a more advantageous ripening, which is frequently used,  and, being simpler, is in many cases a decided advantage. This  method is by the use of what is called a natural starter. A  natural starter consists simply of a lot of cream which has been  taken from the most favourable source possible--that is, from the  cleanest and best dairy, or from the herd producing the best  quality of cream--and allowing this cream to stand in a warm place  for a couple of days until it becomes sour. The cream will by that  time be filled with large numbers of bacteria, and this is then  put as a starter into the vat of cream to be ripened. Of course,  in the use of this method the butter maker has no control over the  kinds of bacteria that will grow in the starter, but it is found,  practically, that if the cream is taken from a good source the  results are extremely favourable, and there is produced in this  way almost always an improvement in the butter.    The use of pure cultures is still quite new, particularly in this  country. In the European butter-making countries they have been  used for a longer period and have become very much better known.  What the future may develop along this line it is difficult to  say; but it seems at least probable that as the difficulties in  the details are mastered the time will come when starters will be  used by our butter makers for their cream ripening, just as yeast  is used by housewives for raising bread, or by brewers for  fermenting malt. These starters will probably in time be furnished  by bacteriologists. Bacteriology, in other words, is offering in  the near future to our butter makers a method of controlling the  ripening of the cream in such a way as to insure the obtaining of  a high and uniform quality of butter, so far, at least, as  concerns flavour and aroma.    BACTERIA IN CHEESE.    Cheese ripening.--The third great product of the dairy industry is  cheese, and in connection with this product the dairyman is even  more dependent upon bacteria than he is in the production of  butter. In the manufacture of cheese the casein of the milk is  separated from the other products by the use of rennet, and is  collected in large masses and pressed, forming the fresh cheese.  This cheese is then set aside for several weeks, and sometimes for  months, to undergo a process that is known as ripening. During the  ripening there are developed in the cheese the peculiar flavours  which are characteristic of the completed product. The taste of  freshly made cheese is extremely unlike that of the ripened  product. While butter made from unripened cream has a pleasant  flavour, and one which is in many places particularly enjoyed,  there is nowhere a demand for unripened cheese, for the freshly  made cheese has a taste that scarce any one regards as pleasant.  Indeed, the whole value of the cheese is dependent upon the  flavour of the product, and this flavour is developed during the  ripening.    The cheese maker finds in the ripening of his cheese the most  difficult part of his manufacture. It is indeed a process over  which he has very little control. Even when all conditions seem to  be correct, when cheese is made in the most careful manner, it not  infrequently occurs that the ripening takes place in a manner that  is entirely abnormal, and the resulting cheese becomes worthless.  The cheese maker has been at an entire loss to understand these  irregularities, nor has he possessed any means of removing them.  The abnormal ripening that occurs takes on various types.  Sometimes the cheese will become extraordinarily porous, filled  with large holes which cause the cheese to swell out of proper  shape and become worthless. At other times various spots of red or  blue appear in the manufactured cheese; while again unpleasant  tastes and flavours develop which render the product of no value.  Sometimes a considerable portion of the product of the cheese  factory undergoes such irregular ripening, and the product for a  long time will thus be worthless. If some means could be  discovered of removing these irregularities it would be a great  boon to the cheese manufacturer; and very many attempts have been  made in one way or another to furnish the cheese maker with some  details in the manufacture which will enable him in a measure to  control the ripening.    The ripening of the cheese has been subjected to a large amount of  study on the part of bacteriologists who have been interested in  dairy products. That the ripening of cheese is the result of  bacterial growth therein appears to be probable from a priori  grounds. Like the ripening of cream, it is a process that occurs  somewhat slowly. It is a chemical change which is accompanied by  the destruction of proteid matter; it takes place best at certain  temperatures, and temperatures which we know are favourable to the  growth of micro-organisms, all of which phenomena suggest to us  the action of bacteria. Moreover, the flavours and the tastes that  arise have a decided resemblance in many cases to the  decomposition products of bacteria, strikingly so in Limburger  cheese. When we come to study the matter of cheese ripening  carefully we learn beyond question that this a priori conclusion  is correct. The ripening of any cheese is dependent upon several  different factors. The method of preparation, the amount of water  left in the curd, the temperature of ripening, and other  miscellaneous factors connected with the mechanical process of  cheese manufacture, affect its character. But, in addition to all  these factors, there is undoubtedly another one, and that is the  number and the character of the bacteria that chance to be in the  curd when the cheese is made. While it is found that cheeses which  are treated by different processes will ripen in a different  manner, it is also found that two cheeses which have been made  under similar conditions and treated in identically the same way  may also ripen in a different manner, so that the resulting  flavour will vary. The variations between cheeses thus made may be  slight or they may be considerable, but variations certainly do  occur. Every one knows the great difference in flavours of  different cheeses, and these flavours are due in considerable  measure to factors other than the simple mechanical process of  making the cheese. The general similarity of the whole process to  a bacterial fermentation leads us to believe at the outset that  some of the differences in character are due to different kinds of  bacteria that multiply in the cheese and produce decomposition  therein.    When the matter comes to be studied by bacteriology, the  demonstration of this position becomes easy. That the ripening of  cheese is due to growth of bacteria is very easily proved by  manufacturing cheeses from milk which is deprived of bacteria. For  instance, cheeses have been made from milk that has been either  sterilized or pasteurized--which processes destroy most of the  bacteria therein--and, treated otherwise in a normal manner, are  set aside to ripen. These cheeses do NOT ripen, but remain for  months with practically the same taste that they had originally.  In other experiments the cheese has been treated with a small  amount of disinfective, which is sufficient to prevent bacteria  from growing, and again ripening is found to be absolutely  prevented. Furthermore, if the cheese under ordinary conditions is  studied during the ripening process, it is found that bacteria are  growing during the whole time. These facts all taken together  plainly prove that the ripening of cheese is a fermentation due to  bacteria. It will be noticed, however, that the conditions in the  cheese are not favourable for very rapid bacterial growth. It is  true that there is plenty of food in the cheese for bacterial  life, but the cheese is not very moist; it is extremely dense,  being subjected in all cases to more or less pressure. The  penetration of oxygen into the centre of the mass must be  extremely slight. The density, the lack of a great amount of  moisture, and the lack of oxygen furnish conditions in which  bacteria will not grow very rapidly. The conditions are far less  favourable than those of ripening cream, and the bacteria do not  grow with anything like the rapidity that they grow in cream.  Indeed, the growth of these organisms during the ripening is  extremely slow compared to the possibilities of bacterial growth  that we have already noticed. Nevertheless, the bacteria do  multiply in the cheese, and as the ripening goes on they become  more and more abundant, although the number fluctuates, rising and  falling under different conditions.    When the attempt is made to determine the relation of the  different kinds of ripening to different kinds of bacteria, it has  thus far met with extremely little success. That different  flavours are due to the ripening produced by different kinds of  bacteria would appear to be almost certain when we remember, as we  have already noticed, the different kinds of decomposition  produced by different species of bacteria. It would seem,  moreover, that it ought not to be very difficult to separate from  the ripened cheese the bacteria which are present, and thus obtain  the kind of bacteria necessary to produce the desired ripening.  But for some reason this does not prove to be so easy in practice  as it seems to be in theory. Many different species of bacteria  have been separated from cheeses. One bacteriologist, studying  several cheeses, separated about eighty different species  therefrom, and others have found perhaps as many more from  different sources. Moreover, experiments have been made with a  considerable"]]]
