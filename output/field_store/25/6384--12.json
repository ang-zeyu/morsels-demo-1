The Professor tried, by evincing interest, ignorance, and incredulity,  and even indignation, to encourage the gorilla to say more; but to his  disappointment, all the more intense after having exchanged that one  word of conversation with one of the beasts, the gorilla only repeated  what it had said, and beat on the cage again. For half an hour this  went on, the Professor showing every sign of sympathy, the gorilla  raging and beating upon the cage.    It was half an hour of the most intense excitement to the Professor,  during which time he saw the realization of dreams that many  considered crazy, glittering as it were within his grasp, and all the  while this ridiculous gorilla would do nothing but repeat the mere  shred of a sentence and beat the cage with its great hands; and the  heat of course was intense. And by the end of the half hour the  excitement and the heat seem to have got the better of the Professor's  temper, and he waved the disgusting brute angrily away with a gesture  that probably was not much less impatient than the gorilla's own. And  at that the animal suddenly became voluble. He beat more furiously  than ever upon the cage and slipped his great fingers through the  bars, trying to reach the Professor, and poured out volumes of  ape-chatter.    Why, why did men shoot at him, he asked. He made himself terrible,  therefore men ought to love him. That was the whole burden of what the  Professor calls its argument. \"Me, me terrible,\" two slaps on the  chest and then a growl. \"Man love me.\" And then the emphatic  negative word, and the sound that meant guns, and sudden furious  rushes at the cage to try to get at the Professor.    The gorilla, Professor Beek explains, evidently admired only strength;  whenever he said \"I make myself terrible to Man,\" a sentence he  often repeated, he drew himself up and thrust out his huge chest and  bared his frightful teeth; and certainly, the Professor says, there  was something terribly grand about the menacing brute. \"Me  terrible,\" he repeated again and again, \"Me terrible. Sky, sun,  stars with me. Man love me. Man love me. No?\" It meant that all the  great forces of nature assisted him and his terrible teeth, which he  gnashed repeatedly, and that therefore man should love him, and he  opened his great jaws wide as he said this, showing all the brutal  force of them.    There was to my mind a genuine ring in Professor Beek's story, because  he was obviously so much more concerned, and really troubled, by the  dreadful depravity of this animal's point of view, or mentality as he  called it, than he was concerned with whether or not we believed what  he had said.    And I mentioned that there was a circumstance in his story of a  plausible and even corroborative nature. It is this. Professor Beek,  who noticed at the time a bullet wound in the tip of the gorilla's  left ear, by means of which it was luckily identified, put his  analysis of its mentality in writing and showed it to several others,  before he had any way of accounting for the beast having such a mind.    Long afterwards it was definitely ascertained that this animal had  been caught when young on the slopes of Kilimanjaro and trained and  even educated, so far as such things are possible, by an eminent  German Professor, a persona grata at the Court of Berlin.          The Home of Herr Schnitzelhaaser      The guns in the town of Greinstein were faintly audible. The family of  Schnitzelhaaser lived alone there in mourning, an old man and old  woman. They never went out or saw any one, for they knew they could  not speak as though they did not mourn. They feared that their secret  would escape them. They had never cared for the war that the War Lord  made. They no longer cared what he did with it. They never read his  speeches; they never hung out flags when he ordered flags: they hadn't  the heart to.    They had had four sons.    The lonely old couple would go as far as the shop for food. Hunger  stalked behind them. They just beat hunger every day, and so saw  evening: but there was nothing to spare. Otherwise they did not go out  at all. Hunger had been coming slowly nearer of late. They had nothing  but the ration, and the ration was growing smaller. They had one pig  of their own, but the law said you might not kill it. So the pig was  no good to them.    They used to go and look at that pig sometimes when hunger pinched.  But more than that they did not dare to contemplate.    Hunger came nearer and nearer. The war was going to end by the first  of July. The War Lord was going to take Paris on this day and that  would end the war at once. But then the war was always going to end.  It was going to end in 1914, and their four sons were to have come  home when the leaves fell. The War Lord had promised that. And even if  it did end, that would not bring their four sons home now. So what did  it matter what the War Lord said.    It was thoughts like these that they knew they had to conceal. It was  because of thoughts like these that they did not trust themselves to  go out and see other people, for they feared that by their looks if by  nothing else, or by their silence or perhaps their tears, they might  imply a blasphemy against the All Highest. And hunger made one so  hasty. What might one not say? And so they stayed indoors.    But now. What would happen now? The War Lord was coming to Greinstein  in order to hear the guns. One officer of the staff was to be billeted  in their house. And what would happen now?    They talked the whole thing over. They must struggle and make an  effort. The officer would be there for one evening. He would leave in  the morning quite early in order to make things ready for the return  to Potsdam: he had charge of the imperial car. So for one evening they  must be merry. They would suppose, it was Herr Schnitzelhaaser's  suggestion, they would think all the evening that Belgium and France  and Luxemburg all attacked the Fatherland, and that the Kaiser,  utterly unprepared, quite unprepared, called on the Germans to defend  their land against Belgium.    Yes, the old woman could imagine that; she could think it all the  evening.    And then,--it was no use not being cheerful altogether,--then one  must imagine a little more, just for the evening: it would come quite  easy; one must think that the four boys were alive.    Hans too? (Hans was the youngest).    Yes, all four. Just for the evening.    But if the officer asks?    He will not ask. What are four soldiers?    So it was all arranged; and at evening the officer came. He brought  his own rations, so hunger came no nearer. Hunger just lay down  outside the door and did not notice the officer.    A this supper the officer began to talk. The Kaiser himself, he said,  was at the Schartzhaus.    \"So,\" said Herr Schnitzelhaaser; \"just over the way.\" So close.  Such an honour.    And indeed the shadow of the Schartzhaus darkened their garden in the  morning.    It was such an honour, said Frau Schnitzelhaaser too. And they began  to praise the Kaiser. So great a War Lord, she said; the most glorious  war there had ever been.    Of course, said the officer, it would end on the first of July.    Of course, said Frau Schnitzelhaaser. And so great an admiral, too.  One must remember that also. And how fortunate we were to have him:  one must not forget that. Had it not been for him the crafty Belgians  would have attacked the Fatherland, but they were struck down before  they could do it. So much better to prevent a bad deed like that than  merely to punish after. So wise. And had it not been for him, if it  had not been for him...    The old man saw that she was breaking down and hastily he took up that  feverish praise. Feverish it was, for their hunger and bitter loss  affected their minds no less than illness does, and the things they  did they did hastily and intemperately. His praise of the War Lord  raced on as the officer ate. He spoke of him as of those that benefit  man, as of monarchs who bring happiness to their people. And now, he  said, he is here in the Schartzhaus beside us, listening to the guns  just like a common soldier.    Finally the guns, as he spoke, coughed beyond ominous hills.  Contentedly the officer went on eating. He suspected nothing of the  thoughts his host and hostess were hiding. At last he went upstairs to  bed.    As fierce exertion is easy to the fevered, so they had spoken; and it  wears them, so they were worn. The old woman wept when the officer  went out of hearing. But old Herr Schnitzelhaaser picked up a big  butcher's knife. \"I will bear it no more,\" he said.    His wife watched him in silence as he went away with his knife. Out of  the house he went and into the night. Through the open door she saw  nothing; all was dark; even the Schartzhaus, where all was gay  to-night, stood dark for fear of aeroplanes. The old woman waited in  silence.    When Herr Schnitzelhaaser returned there was blood on his knife.    \"What have you done?\" the old woman asked him quite calmly. \"I have  killed our pig,\" he said.    She broke out then, all the more recklessly for the long restraint of  the evening; the officer must have heard her.    \"We are lost! We are lost!\" she cried. \"We may not kill our pig.  Hunger has made you mad. You have ruined us.\"    \"I will bear it no longer,\" he said. \"I have killed our pig.\"    \"But they will never let us eat it,\" she cried. \"Oh, you have  ruined us!\"    \"If you did not dare to kill our pig,\" he said, \"why did you not  stop me when you saw me go? You saw me go with the knife?\"    \"I thought,\" she said, \"you were going to kill the Kaiser.\"          A Deed of Mercy      As Hindenburg and the Kaiser came down, as we read, from Mont d'Hiver,  during the recent offensive, they saw on the edge of a crater two  wounded British soldiers.
