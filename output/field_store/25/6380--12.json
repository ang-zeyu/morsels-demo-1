THE LEGEND OF QU'APPELLE VALLEY      I am the one who loved her as my life,    Had watched her grow to sweet young womanhood;  Won the dear privilege to call her wife,    And found the world, because of her, was good.  I am the one who heard the spirit voice,    Of which the paleface settlers love to tell;  From whose strange story they have made their choice    Of naming this fair valley the \"Qu'Appelle.\"    She had said fondly in my eager ear--    \"When Indian summer smiles with dusky lip,  Come to the lakes, I will be first to hear    The welcome music of thy paddle dip.  I will be first to lay in thine my hand,    To whisper words of greeting on the shore;  And when thou would'st return to thine own land,    I'll go with thee, thy wife for evermore.\"    Not yet a leaf had fallen, not a tone    Of frost upon the plain ere I set forth,  Impatient to possess her as my own--    This queen of all the women of the North.  I rested not at even or at dawn,    But journeyed all the dark and daylight through--  Until I reached the Lakes, and, hurrying on,    I launched upon their bosom my canoe.    Of sleep or hunger then I took no heed,    But hastened o'er their leagues of waterways;  But my hot heart outstripped my paddle's speed    And waited not for distance or for days,  But flew before me swifter than the blade    Of magic paddle ever cleaved the Lake,  Eager to lay its love before the maid,    And watch the lovelight in her eyes awake.    So the long days went slowly drifting past;    It seemed that half my life must intervene  Before the morrow, when I said at last--    \"One more day's journey and I win my queen!\"  I rested then, and, drifting, dreamed the more    Of all the happiness I was to claim,--  When suddenly from out the shadowed shore,    I heard a voice speak tenderly my name.    \"Who calls?\" I answered; no reply; and long    I stilled my paddle blade and listened. Then  Above the night wind's melancholy song    I heard distinctly that strange voice again--  A woman's voice, that through the twilight came    Like to a soul unborn--a song unsung.    I leaned and listened--yes, she spoke my name,    And then I answered in the quaint French tongue,  \"Qu'Appelle? Qu'Appelle?\" No answer, and the night    Seemed stiller for the sound, till round me fell  The far-off echoes from the far-off height--    \"Qu'Appelle?\" my voice came back, \"Qu'Appelle? Qu'Appelle?\"  This--and no more; I called aloud until    I shuddered as the gloom of night increased,  And, like a pallid spectre wan and chill,    The moon arose in silence in the east.    I dare not linger on the moment when    My boat I beached beside her tepee door;  I heard the wail of women and of men,--    I saw the death-fires lighted on the shore.  No language tells the torture or the pain,    The bitterness that flooded all my life,--  When I was led to look on her again,    That queen of women pledged to be my wife.  To look upon the beauty of her face,    The still closed eyes, the lips that knew no breath;  To look, to learn,--to realize my place    Had been usurped by my one rival--Death.  A storm of wrecking sorrow beat and broke    About my heart, and life shut out its light  Till through my anguish some one gently spoke,    And said, \"Twice did she call for thee last night.\"    I started up--and bending o'er my dead,    Asked when did her sweet lips in silence close.  \"She called thy name--then passed away,\" they said,  \"Just on the hour whereat the moon arose.\"    Among the lonely Lakes I go no more,    For she who made their beauty is not there;  The paleface rears his tepee on the shore    And says the vale is fairest of the fair.  Full many years have vanished since, but still    The voyageurs beside the campfire tell  How, when the moonrise tips the distant hill,    They hear strange voices through the silence swell.  The paleface loves the haunted lakes they say,    And journeys far to watch their beauty spread  Before his vision; but to me the day,    The night, the hour, the seasons are all dead.  I listen heartsick, while the hunters tell    Why white men named the valley The Qu'Appelle.        THE ART OF ALMA-TADEMA      There is no song his colours cannot sing,    For all his art breathes melody, and tunes  The fine, keen beauty that his brushes bring    To murmuring marbles and to golden Junes.    The music of those marbles you can hear    In every crevice, where the deep green stains  Have sunken when the grey days of the year    Spilled leisurely their warm, incessant rains    That, lingering, forget to leave the ledge,    But drenched into the seams, amid the hush  Of ages, leaving but the silent pledge    To waken to the wonder of his brush.    And at the Master's touch the marbles leap    To life, the creamy onyx and the skins  Of copper-coloured leopards, and the deep,    Cool basins where the whispering water wins    Reflections from the gold and glowing sun,    And tints from warm, sweet human flesh, for fair  And subtly lithe and beautiful, leans one--    A goddess with a wealth of tawny hair.        GOOD-BYE      Sounds of the seas grow fainter,    Sounds of the sands have sped;  The sweep of gales,  The far white sails,    Are silent, spent and dead.    Sounds of the days of summer    Murmur and die away,  And distance hides  The long, low tides,    As night shuts out the day.          MISCELLANEOUS POEMS    (These miscellaneous poems are all of later date.)        IN GREY DAYS      Measures of oil for others,    Oil and red wine,  Lips laugh and drink, but never    Are the lips mine.    Worlds at the feet of others,    Power gods have known,  Hearts for the favoured round me    Mine beats, alone.    Fame offering to others    Chaplets of bays,  I with no crown of laurels,    Only grey days.    Sweet human love for others,    Deep as the sea,  God-sent unto my neighbour--    But not to me.    Sometime I'll wrest from others    More than all this,  I shall demand from Heaven    Far sweeter bliss.    What profit then to others,    Laughter and wine?  I'll have what most they covet--    Death, will be mine.        BRANDON      (ACROSTIC)    Born on the breast of the prairie, she smiles to her sire--the sun,  Robed in the wealth of her wheat-lands, gift of her mothering soil,  Affluence knocks at her gateways, opulence waits to be won.  Nuggets of gold are her acres, yielding and yellow with spoil,  Dream of the hungry millions, dawn of the food-filled age,  Over the starving tale of want her fingers have turned the page;  Nations will nurse at her storehouse, and God gives her grain for wage.        THE INDIAN CORN PLANTER      He needs must leave the trapping and the chase,    For mating game his arrows ne'er despoil,  And from the hunter's heaven turn his face,    To wring some promise from the dormant soil.    He needs must leave the lodge that wintered him,    The enervating fires, the blanket bed--  The women's dulcet voices, for the grim    Realities of labouring for bread.    So goes he forth beneath the planter's moon    With sack of seed that pledges large increase,  His simple pagan faith knows night and noon,    Heat, cold, seedtime and harvest shall not cease.    And yielding to his needs, this honest sod,    Brown as the hand that tills it, moist with rain,  Teeming with ripe fulfilment, true as God,    With fostering richness, mothers every grain.        THE CATTLE COUNTRY      Up the dusk-enfolded prairie,    Foot-falls, soft and sly,  Velvet cushioned, wild and wary,    Then--the coyote's cry.    Rush of hoofs, and roar and rattle,    Beasts of blood and breed,  Twenty thousand frightened cattle,    Then--the wild stampede.    Pliant lasso circling wider    In the frenzied flight--  Loping horse and cursing rider,    Plunging through the night.    Rim of dawn the darkness losing    Trail of blackened soil;  Perfume of the sage brush oozing    On the air like oil.    Foothills to the Rockies lifting    Brown, and blue, and green,  Warm Alberta sunlight drifting    Over leagues between.    That's the country of the ranges,    Plain and prairie land,  And the God who never changes    Holds it in His hand.        AUTUMN'S ORCHESTRA      (INSCRIBED TO ONE BEYOND SEAS)    Know by the thread of music woven through  This fragile web of cadences I spin,  That I have only caught these songs since you  Voiced them upon your haunting violin.    THE OVERTURE    October's orchestra plays softly on  The northern forest with its thousand strings,  And Autumn, the conductor wields anon  The Golden-rod-- The baton that he swings.    THE FIRS    There is a lonely minor chord that sings  Faintly and far along the forest ways,  When the firs finger faintly on the strings  Of that rare violin the night wind plays,  Just as it whispered once to you and me  Beneath the English pines beyond the sea.    MOSSES    The lost wind wandering, forever grieves      Low overhead,  Above grey mosses whispering of leaves      Fallen and dead.  And through the lonely night sweeps their refrain  Like Chopin's prelude, sobbing 'neath the rain.    THE VINE    The wild grape mantling the trail and tree,  Festoons in graceful veils its drapery,  Its tendrils cling, as clings the memory stirred  By some evasive haunting tune, twice heard.    THE MAPLE    I    It is the blood-hued maple straight and strong,  Voicing abroad its patriotic song.    II    Its daring colours bravely flinging forth  The ensign of the Nation of the North.    HARE-BELL    Elfin bell in azure dress,  Chiming all day long,  Ringing through the wilderness  Dulcet notes of song.  Daintiest of forest flowers  Weaving like a spell--  Music through the Autumn hours,  Little Elfin bell.    THE GIANT OAK    And then the sound of marching armies 'woke  Amid the branches of the soldier oak,  And tempests ceased their warring cry, and dumb  The lashing storms"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],[0,"The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#13)"],[1,"den, as set forth in Genesis; but it  affirms that none but Adam is or shall be answerable for Adam's  disobedience; that mankind in general are absolutely absolved  from responsibility for that \"original sin,\" and that each shall  account for his own transgressions alone; that the Fall was  foreknown of God--that it was turned to good effect by which the  necessary condition of mortality should be inaugurated; and that  a Redeemer was provided, before the world was; that general  salvation, in the sense of redemption from the effects of the  Fall, comes to all without their seeking it; but that individual  salvation or rescue from the effects of personal sins is to be  acquired by each for himself by faith and good works through the  redemption wrought by Jesus Christ.  The Church holds that  children are born to earth in a sinless state, that they need no  individual redemption; that should they die before reaching years  of accountability, they return without taint of earthly sin; but  as they attain youth or maturity in the flesh, their  responsibility increases with their development.    According to the teachings of \"Mormonism,\" Christ's instructions  to the people to pray \"Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on  earth as it is in heaven\" was not a petition for the impossible,  but a fore-shadowing of what shall eventually be.  We believe  that the day shall yet come when the Kingdom of God on earth  shall be one with the Kingdom in heaven; and one King shall rule  in both.  The Church is regarded as the beginning of this Kingdom  on earth; though until the coming of the King, there is no  authority in the Church exercising or claiming temporal rule or  dominion among the governments of earth.  Yet the Church is none  the less the beginning of the Kingdom, the germ from which the  Kingdom shall develop.    And the Church must be in direct communication with the heavenly  Kingdom of which the earthly Kingdom when established shall be a  part.  Of such a nature was the Church in so far as it existed  before the time of Christ's earthly ministry; for the biblical  record is replete with instances of direct communication between  the prophets and their God.  The scriptures are silent as to a  single dispensation in which the spiritual leaders of the people  depended upon the records of earlier times and by-gone ages for  their guidance; but on the contrary, the evidence is complete  that in every stage of the Church's history the God of heaven  communicated his mind and will unto his earthly representatives.  Israel of old were led and governed in all matters spiritual and  to a great extent in their temporal affairs by the direct word of  revelation.  Noah did not depend upon the record of God's  dealings with Adam or Enoch, but was directed by the very word  and voice of the God whom he represented.  Moses was no mere  theologian trained for his authority or acts on what God had said  to Abraham, to Isaac, or to Jacob; he acted in accordance with  instructions given unto him from time to time, as the  circumstances of his ministry required.  And so on through all  the line of prophets, major and minor, down to the priest of the  course of Abia unto whom the angel announced the birth of John  who was to be the direct fore-runner of the Messiah.    When the Christ came in the flesh he declared that he acted not  of himself but according to instructions given him of the Father.  Thus the Messiah was a revelator, receiving while in the flesh  communication direct and frequent from the heavens.  By such  revelation he was guided in his earthly ministry; by such he  instructed his disciples; unto such he taught his apostles to  look for safe guidance when he would have left them.    During his earthly ministry Christ called and ordained men to  offices in the Church.  We have a record of apostles  particularly, numbering twelve, and beside these, seventy others  who were commissioned to preach, teach, baptize and perform other  ordinances of the Church.  After our Lord's departure, we read of  the apostles continuing their labors in the light of continued  revelation.  By this sure guide they selected and set apart those  who were to officiate in the Church.  By revelation, Peter was  directed to carry the gospel to the Gentiles; which expansion of  the work was inaugurated by the conversion of the devout  Cornelius and his household.  By revelation, Saul of Tarsus  became Paul the Apostle, a valiant defender of the faith.  Holy  men of old spake and wrote as they were moved upon by the Holy  Ghost and depended not upon the precedents of ancient history nor  entirely upon the law then already written.  They operated under  the conviction that the living Church must be in communication  with its living Head; and that the work of God, while it was to  be wrought out through the instrumentality of man, was to be  directed by him whose work it was, and is.    \"Mormonism\" claims the same necessity to exist today.  It holds  that it is no more nearly possible now than it was in the days of  the ancient prophets or in the apostolic age for the Church of  Christ to exist without direct and continuous revelation from  God.  This necessitates the existence and authorized  ministrations of prophets, apostles, high priests, seventies,  elders, bishops, priests, teachers and deacons, now as  anciently--not men selected by men without authority, clothed by  human ceremonial alone, nor men with the empty names of office,  but men who bear the title because they possess the authority,  having been called of God.    Is it unreasonable, is it unphilosophical, thus to look for  additional light and knowledge?  Shall religion be the one  department of human thought and effort in which progression is  impossible?  What would we say of the chemist, the astronomer,  the physicist, or the geologist, who would proclaim that no  further discovery or revelation of scientific truth is possible,  or who would declare that the only occupation open to students of  science is to con the books of by-gone times and to apply the  principles long ago made known, since none others shall ever be  discovered?    The chief motive impelling to research and investigation is the  conviction that to knowledge and wisdom there is no end.  \"Mormonism\" affirms that all wisdom is of God, that the halo of  his glory is intelligence, and that man has not yet learned all  there is to learn of him and his ways.  We hold that the doctrine  of continuous revelation from God is not less philosophical and  scientific than scriptural.        CHAPTER II    The Latter-day Saints affirm that the authority to act in the  name of God--the Holy Priesthood--has been restored to earth in  this dispensation and age, in accordance with the inspired  predictions of earlier times.  But, it may be asked, what  necessity was there for a restoration if the Priesthood had been  once established upon earth?  None indeed, had it never been  taken away.  A general apostasy from the primitive Church is  conceded in effect by some authorities in ecclesiastical history;  though few admit the entire discontinuance of priestly power, or  the full suspension of authority to operate in the ordinances of  the Church.  This great apostasy was foretold.  Paul warned the  Saints of Thessalonica against those who claimed that the second  coming of Christ was then near at hand: \"For,\" said he, \"that day  shall not come except there come a falling away first.\"  (II  Thess. 2:3.)  \"Mormonism\" contends that there has been a general  falling away from the Church of Christ, dating from the time  immediately following the apostolic period.  We believe that the  proper interpretation of history will confirm this view; and,  moreover, that the inspired scriptures foretold just such a  condition.[5]    [Footnote 5: See \"The Great Apostasy: Considered in the Light of  Scriptural and Secular History,\" by James E. Talmage.  Published  by the _Deseret News_, Salt Lake City, Utah; 176 pp.]    If the Priesthood had been once taken from the earth no human  power could re-establish it; the restoration of this authority  from heaven would be necessary.  The Church claims that in the  present age this restoration has been effected by the personal  ministrations of those who exercised the authority in earlier  dispensations.  Thus, in 1829, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery  received the Lesser or Aaronic Priesthood under the hands of John  the Baptist, who visited them as a resurrected being--the same  Baptist who by special and divine commission held the authority  of that Priesthood in the dispensation of the \"Meridian of Time.\"  Later, the Higher or Melchizedek Priesthood was conferred upon  them through the personal ministrations of Peter, James, and  John--the same three who constituted the presidency of the  apostolic body in the primitive Church, after the departure of  the Lord Jesus Christ by whom it was founded.    That the claim is a bold one is conceded without argument.  The  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints professes to have the  Priesthood of old restored in its fulness; and, moreover, while  acknowledging the right of every individual as of every sect or  other organization of individuals to believe and practise  according to choice in matters religious, it affirms that it is  the only Church on the face of the earth possessing this  authority and Priesthood; and that therefore it is _The Church_  and the only Church of Christ upon the earth today.  It holds as  absolutely indispensable to proper Church organization, the  presence of the living oracles of God who shall be directed from  the heavens in their earthly ministry; and these, \"Mormonism\"  asserts, are to be found with the Church of Jesus Christ.    \"Mormonism\" emphasizes the doctrine that that which is Caesar's  be given unto Caesar, while that which is God's be rendered unto  him.  Therefore, it teaches that all things pertaining"]]]
