[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6104"],[0,"Station Life in New Zealand (#13)"],[1," result. In the evening we played round games. But we all went early  to bed, as, we had to be up betimes, and in the saddle by seven o'clock,  to catch the 9-30 train at Rolleston; twenty miles off. We had a  beautiful, still morning for our ride, and reached the station--a shed  standing out on the plain--in time to see our horses safely paddocked  before the train started for Christchurch. The distance by rail was only  fifteen miles, so we were not long about it; and we walked to the hotel  from the railway-station in the town. A bath and breakfast were both  very enjoyable, and then F---- went out to transact his business, and I  employed myself in unpacking and _ironing_ a ball-dress for a party,  to which we were engaged that evening. There was also another ball the  following night. The second was a very late one, and we had scarcely an  hour's sleep before we were obliged to get up and start by the 6 A.M.  train back to Rolleston, where we remounted our horses and rode to dear  little Waireka in time for breakfast. By the evening I was sufficiently  rested to make another cake, which also, happily, turned out well.    We intended to return home the next day (Friday), but a terrific  \"nor'-wester\" came on in the night, and it was impossible to stir out of  the house; it was the severest gale since our arrival, and it is hardly  possible to give you a correct idea of the force and fury of the wind.  Not a glimpse of the mountains was to be seen; a haze of dust, as thick  as any fog, shut everything out. The sheep had all taken refuge under  the high banks of the creeks. It is curious that sheep always feed head  to wind in a nor'-west gale, whereas they will drift for miles before  a sou'-wester. The trees bent almost flat before the hot breath of this  hurricane, and although the house was built of cob, and its walls were  very thick and solid, the creaking and swaying of the shingled roof kept  me in perpetual alarm. The verandah was a great protection; and yet  the small river-pebbles, of which the garden-walk was made, were dashed  against the windows like hailstones by each gust. We amused ourselves  indoors by the study and composition of acrostics, and so got through an  imprisonment of two days, without a moment's cessation of the wind;  but towards sunset on Saturday there were signs of a lull, and about  midnight the gale dropped; and we heard the grateful, refreshing sound  of soft and continuous rain, and when we came out to breakfast on  Sunday morning everything looked revived again. It is a most fortunate  meteorological fact that these very high winds are generally succeeded  by heavy rain; everything is so parched and shrivelled up by them that  I do not know what would become of the vegetation otherwise. We held a  council, to determine what had better be done about returning home, and  finally decided to risk a wet ride sooner than disappoint the little  congregation; for should it prove a fine afternoon, those who lived near  would certainly come; so we mounted after breakfast.    I was wrapped in one of the gentlemen's macintoshes, and found the ride  far from disagreeable. As we neared our own station we began to look out  for signs of disaster; and about half a mile from the house saw some of  the vanes from the chimneys on the track; a little nearer home, across  the path lay a large zinc chimney-pot; then another; and when we came  close enough to see the house distinctly, it looked very much dwarfed  without its chimneys. There had been a large pile of empty boxes at  the back of the stable; these were all blown away in the gale. One huge  packing-case was sailing tranquilly about on the pond, and planks and  fragments of zinc were strewn over the paddock. The moment we reached  the house, Mr. U----, the gentleman-cadet of whom I have told you, came  out, with a melancholy face, to tell me that a large wooden cage, full  of the canaries which I had brought from England with me, had been blown  out of the verandah, though it was on the most sheltered side of the  house. It really seemed incredible at first, but the cage was lying  in ruins in the middle of the paddock, and all my birds except one  had disappeared. It happened in the middle of the night, and Mr.  U----described, very amusingly, that when he was awakened by the noise  which the cage made against a wire fence (which it just \"topped\" in  passing), he sprang out of his bed in the attic, and clambered out of  the window, expecting to find the very heavy sort of staircase-ladder in  its place; but it was \"over the hills and far away,\" so he had a drop of  about twelve feet to the ground, which thoroughly aroused him. He went  into the verandah to see if the cage was safe, and was nearly knocked  down by a big tin bath, ordinarily kept there, which was just starting  across country. As soon as he missed the cage he very pluckily went  after it, being able to keep sight of it by the fitful gleams of  moon-light, and he was just in time to rescue the poor little surviving  canary. We could not help laughing at the recital of all the mischief  which had been done, but still it is very tiresome, and the garden  looks, if possible, more wretched than ever. There is no shelter for  it yet, and my poor green-peas are blown nearly out of the ground. It  rained hard all the evening, so our congregation was confined to the  home party.          Letter XIV: A Christmas picnic, and other doings.      Broomielaw, December 1866. It is too late to wish you a merry Christmas  and a happy New Year in this letter. In order to allow them to reach you  in time I should have sent my good wishes in October's letter; I must  remember to do so next year. I am writing on the last days of the month,  so I shall be able to tell you of our own Christmas doings; though,  first, I must describe the festivities attending a \"coming of age in  the Bush,\" to which we were invited about the middle of this month. How  strange Christmas picnics and balls will appear in your eyes, before  which still dangle probably the dear old traditional holly and ivy! I am  obliged to preface all my descriptions with an account of a ride, if  I am to begin, according to your repeated injunctions, at the very  beginning; for a ride is quite certain to be both the beginning and end  of each excursion, simply because we have no other means of going about,  except on our feet. The ride upon this occasion was to Rockwood, where  the birthday party was to assemble, but the road had not now so many  terrors for me. In consequence of the fine dry weather, most of the bad  places were safer and firmer, and the numerous creeks were only shallow  sparkling streamlets over which a child could jump, instead of the muddy  noisy wide brooks of three months ago. The day on which we started, this  time, was a great contrast to the former one. When we reached the saddle  I have before told you of, instead of being met and nearly driven back  by a violent \"sutherly buster,\" we stopped before beginning the steep  descent to admire the exquisite view before us.    Close on our right hand rose the Government bush out of which we get our  firewood, standing grand and gloomy amid huge cliffs and crags; even  the summer sunshine could not enliven it, nor the twitter and chirrup  of countless birds. In front, the chain of hills we were crossing rolled  down in gradually decreasing hillocks, till they merged in the vast  plains before us, stretching away as far as the eye could reach towards  the south, all quivering in the haze and glare of the bright sunlight.  The background, extending along the horizon, was formed of lofty  mountains still glistening white against the dazzling blue sky. Just at  our feet the Rockwood paddocks looked like carpets of emerald velvet,  spread out among the yellowish tussocks; the fences which enclose them  were either golden with broom and gorse, or gay with wild roses and  honeysuckle. Beyond these we saw the bright patches of flowers in the  garden, and nothing could be more effective than the white gable of the  house standing out against the vast black birch forest which clothed the  steep hill-sides for miles--the contrast was so picturesque between the  little bit of civilization and culture and the great extent of wild,  savage scenery around it. After the utter treelessness of our own  immediate neighbourhood, the sight of such a mass of foliage is a joy to  my eyes.    The day following our arrival was _the_ birthday, and we prepared  to enjoy every hour of it. The party assembled was a very large one,  consisting, however, chiefly of gentlemen, for the utmost exertions in  the district could not produce more than five ladies altogether, and  two of those had come an immense way. Directly after breakfast we all  sallied forth, the ladies equipped in light cotton dresses (muslin is  too thin for the bush) and little sailor hats,--we did not want shady  ones, for never a gleam of sun can penetrate into a real New Zealand  Bush, unless in a spot which has been very much cleared. Strong boots  with nails in the soles, to help us to keep on our feet up the steep  clay hill-sides, and a stout stick, completed our equipment; perhaps  we were not very smart, but we looked like going at all events. I can  answer for myself that I enjoyed every moment of that long Midsummer  holiday most intensely, though I fear I must have wearied our dear,  charming host, by my incessant questions about the names of the trees  and shrubs, and of the habits and ways of the thousands of birds. It was  all so new and so delightful to me,--the green gloom, the hoarse croak  of the ka-ka, as it alighted almost at our feet and prepared, quite  careless of our vicinity, to tear up the loose soil at the root of a  tall tree, in search of grubs. It is a species of parrot, but with very  dingy reddish-brown plumage, only slightly enlivened by a few, scarlet  feathers in the wing.

The post-runner had brought the mail as usual, and there was one  private letter for me.  I opened it with great excitement, for the  envelope bore the stamp of the firm.  At last Colles had deigned to  answer.    Inside was a sheet of the firm's notepaper, with the signature of  Colles across the top.  Below some one had pencilled these five words:    '_The Blesbok[1] are changing ground._'    I looked to see that Japp had not suffocated himself, then shut up the  store, and went back to my room to think out this new mystification.    The thing had come from Colles, for it was the private notepaper of the  Durban office, and there was Colles' signature. But the pencilling was  in a different hand.  My deduction from this was that some one wished  to send me a message, and that Colles had given that some one a sheet  of signed paper to serve as a kind of introduction.  I might take it,  therefore, that the scribble was Colles' reply to my letter.    Now, my argument continued, if the unknown person saw fit to send me a  message, it could not be merely one of warning. Colles must have told  him that I was awake to some danger, and as I was in  Blaauwildebeestefontein, I must be nearer the heart of things than any  one else.  The message must therefore be in the nature of some  password, which I was to remember when I heard it again.    I reasoned the whole thing out very clearly, and I saw no gap in my  logic.  I cannot describe how that scribble had heartened me.  I felt  no more the crushing isolation of yesterday. There were others beside  me in the secret.  Help must be on the way, and the letter was the  first tidings.    But how near?--that was the question; and it occurred to me for the  first time to look at the postmark.  I went back to the store and got  the envelope out of the waste-paper basket. The postmark was certainly  not Durban.  The stamp was a Cape Colony one, and of the mark I could  only read three letters, T. R. S.  This was no sort of clue, and I  turned the thing over, completely baffled.  Then I noticed that there  was no mark of the post town of delivery.  Our letters to  Blaauwildebeestefontein came through Pietersdorp and bore that mark.  I  compared the envelope with others.  They all had a circle, and  'Pietersdorp' in broad black letters.  But this envelope had nothing  except the stamp.    I was still slow at detective work, and it was some minutes before the  explanation flashed on me.  The letter had never been posted at all.  The stamp was a fake, and had been borrowed from an old envelope.  There was only one way in which it could have come.  It must have been  put in the letter-bag while the postman was on his way from  Pietersdorp.  My unknown friend must therefore be somewhere within  eighty miles of me.  I hurried off to look for the post-runner, but he  had started back an hour before.  There was nothing for it but to wait  on the coming of the unknown.    That afternoon I again took Mr Wardlaw for a walk.  It is an ingrained  habit of mine that I never tell anyone more of a business than is  practically necessary.  For months I had kept all my knowledge to  myself, and breathed not a word to a soul. But I thought it my duty to  tell Wardlaw about the letter, to let him see that we were not  forgotten.  I am afraid it did not encourage his mind.  Occult messages  seemed to him only the last proof of a deadly danger encompassing us,  and I could not shake his opinion.    We took the same road to the crown of the Berg, and I was confirmed in  my suspicion that the woods were empty and the watchers gone.  The  place was as deserted as the bush at Umvelos'.  When we reached the  summit about sunset we waited anxiously for the sound of drums.  It  came, as we expected, louder and more menacing than before.  Wardlaw  stood pinching my arm as the great tattoo swept down the escarpment,  and died away in the far mountains beyond the Olifants. Yet it no  longer seemed to be a wall of sound, shutting us out from our kindred  in the West.  A message had pierced the wall.  If the blesbok were  changing ground, I believed that the hunters were calling out their  hounds and getting ready for the chase.      [1] A species of buck.        CHAPTER VII    CAPTAIN ARCOLL TELLS A TALE    It froze in the night, harder than was common on the Berg even in  winter, and as I crossed the road next morning it was covered with  rime.  All my fears had gone, and my mind was strung high with  expectation.  Five pencilled words may seem a small thing to build hope  on, but it was enough for me, and I went about my work in the store  with a reasonably light heart.  One of the first things I did was to  take stock of our armoury.  There were five sporting Mausers of a cheap  make, one Mauser pistol, a Lee-Speed carbine, and a little  nickel-plated revolver.  There was also Japp's shot-gun, an old  hammered breech-loader, as well as the gun I had brought out with me.  There was a good supply of cartridges, including a stock for a .400  express which could not be found.  I pocketed the revolver, and  searched till I discovered a good sheath-knife.  If fighting was in  prospect I might as well look to my arms.    All the morning I sat among flour and sugar possessing my soul in as  much patience as I could command.  Nothing came down the white road  from the west.  The sun melted the rime; the flies came out and buzzed  in the window; Japp got himself out of bed, brewed strong coffee, and  went back to his slumbers.  Presently it was dinner-time, and I went  over to a silent meal with Wardlaw.  When I returned I must have fallen  asleep over a pipe, for the next thing I knew I was blinking drowsily  at the patch of sun in the door, and listening for footsteps.  In the  dead stillness of the afternoon I thought I could discern a shuffling  in the dust.  I got up and looked out, and there, sure enough, was some  one coming down the road.    But it was only a Kaffir, and a miserable-looking object at that.  I  had never seen such an anatomy.  It was a very old man, bent almost  double, and clad in a ragged shirt and a pair of foul khaki trousers.  He carried an iron pot, and a few belongings were tied up in a dirty  handkerchief.  He must have been a _dacha_[1] smoker, for he coughed  hideously, twisting his body with the paroxysms.  I had seen the type  before--the old broken-down native who had no kin to support him, and  no tribe to shelter him.  They wander about the roads, cooking their  wretched meals by their little fires, till one morning they are found  stiff under a bush.    The native gave me a good-day in Kaffir, then begged for tobacco or a  handful of mealie-meal.    I asked him where he came from.    'From the west, Inkoos,' he said, 'and before that from the south.  It  is a sore road for old bones.'    I went into the store to fetch some meal, and when I came out he had  shuffled close to the door.  He had kept his eyes on the ground, but  now he looked up at me, and I thought he had very bright eyes for such  an old wreck.    'The nights are cold, Inkoos,' he wailed, 'and my folk are scattered,  and I have no kraal.  The aasvogels follow me, and I can hear the  blesbok.' 'What about the blesbok?' I asked with a start.    'The blesbok are changing ground,' he said, and looked me straight in  the face.    'And where are the hunters?' I asked. 'They are here and behind me,' he  said in English, holding out his pot for my meal, while he began to  edge into the middle of the road.    I followed, and, speaking English, asked him if he knew of a man named  Colles.    'I come from him, young Baas.  Where is your house?  Ah, the school.  There will be a way in by the back window?  See that it is open, for  I'll be there shortly.'  Then lifting up his voice he called down in  Sesuto all manner of blessings on me for my kindness, and went  shuffling down the sunlit road, coughing like a volcano.    In high excitement I locked up the store and went over to Mr Wardlaw.  No children had come to school that day, and he was sitting idle,  playing patience.  'Lock the door,' I said, 'and come into my room.  We're on the brink of explanations.'    In about twenty minutes the bush below the back-window parted and the  Kaffir slipped out.  He grinned at me, and after a glance round, hopped  very nimbly over the sill.  Then he examined the window and pulled the  curtains.    'Is the outer door shut?' he asked in excellent English.  'Well, get me  some hot water, and any spare clothes you may possess, Mr Crawfurd.  I  must get comfortable before we begin our _indaba_.[2]  We've the night  before us, so there's plenty of time. But get the house clear, and see  that nobody disturbs me at my toilet.  I am a modest man, and sensitive  about my looks.'    I brought him what he wanted, and looked on at an amazing  transformation.  Taking a phial from his bundle, he rubbed some liquid  on his face and neck and hands, and got rid of the black colouring.  His body and legs he left untouched, save that he covered them with  shirt and trousers from my wardrobe. Then he pulled off a scaly wig,  and showed beneath it a head of close-cropped grizzled hair.  In ten  minutes the old Kaffir had been transformed into an active  soldierly-looking man of maybe fifty years.  Mr Wardlaw stared as if he  had seen a resurrection.    'I had better introduce myself,' he said, when he had taken the edge  off his thirst and hunger.  'My name is Arcoll, Captain James Arcoll.  I am speaking to Mr Crawfurd, the storekeeper, and Mr Wardlaw, the  schoolmaster, of Blaauwildebeestefontein. Where, by the way, is Mr  Peter Japp?  Drunk?  Ah, yes, it was always his failing.  The quorum,  however, is complete without him.'    By this time it was about sunset, and I remember I cocked my ear to  hear the drums beat.  Captain Arcoll noticed the movement as he noticed  all else. 'You're listening for the drums,"]]]
