Hercule put out the lights in the coffee-room, and then he and I went  upstairs--not to bed, mind you--but to have a quiet talk together over  the events of the past half-hour.    The result of our talk was that ten minutes later my man quietly stole  downstairs and out of the house. He did not, however, go out by the  front door, but through a back way which, leading through a  cabbage-patch and then across a field, cuts into the main road some two  hundred metres higher up.    Hercule and I had decided that he would walk the three leagues into  Calais, despite the cold, which was intense, and the blizzard, which was  nearly blinding, and that he would call at the post of gendarmerie at  the city gates, and there see the officer in command and tell him the  exact state of the case. It would then be for that officer to decide  what was to be done; our responsibility as loyal citizens would be  completely covered.    Hercule, you must know, had just emerged from our cabbage-patch on to  the field when he was suddenly challenged:    \"Qui va la?\"    He gave his name. His certificate of citizenship was in his pocket; he  had nothing to fear. Through the darkness and the veil of snow he had  discerned a small group of men wearing the uniform of the 9th Regiment  of the Line.    \"Four men,\" said the foremost of these, speaking quickly and  commandingly, \"wearing the same uniform that I and my men are wearing  ... have you seen them?\"    \"Yes,\" said Hercule hurriedly.    \"Where are they?\"    \"In the outhouse close by.\"    The other suppressed a cry of triumph.    \"At them, my men!\" he said in a whisper, \"and you, citizen, thank your  stars that we have not come too late.\"    \"These men ...\" whispered Hercule. \"I had my suspicions.\"    \"Aristocrats, citizen,\" rejoined the commander of the little party, \"and  one of them is that cursed Englishman--the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"    Already the soldiers, closely followed by Hercule, had made their way  through our cabbage-patch back to the house.    The next moment they had made a bold dash for the barn. There was a  great deal of shouting, a great deal of swearing and some firing, whilst  Hercule and I, not a little frightened, remained in the coffee-room,  anxiously awaiting events.    Presently the group of soldiers returned, not the ones who had first  come, but the others. I noticed their leader, who seemed to be  exceptionally tall.    He looked very cheerful, and laughed loudly as he entered the  coffee-room. From the moment that I looked at his face I knew, somehow,  that Hercule and I had been fooled, and that now, indeed, we stood eye  to eye with that mysterious personage who is called the Scarlet  Pimpernel.    I screamed, and Hercule made a dash for the door; but what could two  humble and peaceful citizens do against this band of desperate men, who  held their lives in their own hands? They were four and we were two, and  I do believe that their leader has supernatural strength and power.    He treated us quite kindly, even though he ordered his followers to bind  us down to our bed upstairs, and to tie a cloth round our mouths so that  our cries could not be distinctly heard.    Neither my man nor I closed an eye all night, of course, but we heard  the miscreants moving about in the coffee-room below. But they did no  mischief, nor did they steal any of the food or wines.    At daybreak we heard them going out by the front door, and their  footsteps disappearing toward Calais. We found their discarded uniforms  lying in the coffee-room. They must have entered Calais by daylight,  when the gates were opened--just like other peaceable citizens. No doubt  they had forged passports, just as they had stolen uniforms.    Our maid-of-all-work released us from our terrible position in the  course of the morning, and we released the soldiers of the 9th Regiment  of the Line, whom we found bound and gagged, some of them wounded, in  the outhouse.    That same afternoon we were arrested, and here we are, ready to die if  we must, but I swear that I have told you the truth, and I ask you, in  the name of justice, if we have done anything wrong, and if we did not  act like loyal and true citizens, even though we were pitted against an  emissary of the devil?          IV    THE OLD SCARECROW      Nobody in the quartier could quite recollect when it was that the new  Public Letter-Writer first set up in business at the angle formed by the  Quai des Augustins and the Rue Dauphine, immediately facing the Pont  Neuf; but there he certainly was on the 28th day of February, 1793, when  Agnes, with eyes swollen with tears, a market basket on her arm, and a  look of dreary despair on her young face, turned that selfsame angle on  her way to the Pont Neuf, and nearly fell over the rickety construction  which sheltered him and his stock-in-trade.    \"Oh, mon Dieu! citizen Lepine, I had no idea you were here,\" she  exclaimed as soon as she had recovered her balance.    \"Nor I, citizeness, that I should have the pleasure of seeing you this  morning,\" he retorted.    \"But you were always at the other corner of the Pont Neuf,\" she argued.    \"So I was,\" he replied, \"so I was. But I thought I would like a change.  The Faubourg St. Michel appealed to me; most of my clients came to me  from this side of the river--all those on the other side seem to know  how to read and write.\"    \"I was just going over to see you,\" she remarked.    \"You, citizeness,\" he exclaimed in unfeigned surprise, \"what should  procure a poor public writer the honour of--\"    \"Hush, in God's name!\" broke in the young girl quickly as she cast a  rapid, furtive glance up and down the quai and the narrow streets which  converged at this angle.    She was dressed in the humblest and poorest of clothes, her skimpy shawl  round her shoulders could scarce protect her against the cold of this  cruel winter's morning; her hair was entirely hidden beneath a frilled  and starched cap, and her feet were encased in coarse worsted stockings  and sabots, but her hands were delicate and fine, and her face had that  nobility of feature and look of patient resignation in the midst of  overwhelming sorrow which proclaimed a lofty refinement both of soul and  of mind.    The old Letter-Writer was surveying the pathetic young figure before him  through his huge horn-rimmed spectacles, and she smiled on him through  her fast-gathering tears. He used to have his pitch at the angle of the  Pont Neuf, and whenever Agnes had walked past it, she had nodded to him  and bidden him \"Good morrow!\" He had at times done little commissions  for her and gone on errands when she needed a messenger; to-day, in the  midst of her despair, she had suddenly thought of him and that rumour  credited him with certain knowledge which she would give her all to  possess.    She had sallied forth this morning with the express purpose of speaking  with him; but now suddenly she felt afraid, and stood looking at him for  a moment or two, hesitating, wondering if she dared tell him--one never  knew these days into what terrible pitfall an ill-considered word might  lead one.    A scarecrow he was, that old Public Letter-Writer, more like a great,  gaunt bird than a human being, with those spectacles of his, and his  long, very sparse and very lanky fringe of a beard which fell from his  cheeks and chin and down his chest for all the world like a crumpled  grey bib. He was wrapped from head to foot in a caped coat which had  once been green in colour, but was now of many hues not usually seen in  rainbows. He wore his coat all buttoned down the front, like a  dressing-gown, and below the hem there peeped out a pair of very large  feet encased in boots which had never been a pair. He sat upon a  rickety, straw-bottomed chair under an improvised awning which was made  up of four poles and a bit of sacking. He had a table in front of him--a  table partially and very insecurely propped up by a bundle of old papers  and books, since no two of its four legs were completely whole--and on  the table there was a neckless bottle half-filled with ink, a few sheets  of paper and a couple of quill pens.    The young girl's hesitation had indeed not lasted more than a few  seconds.    Furtively, like a young creature terrified of lurking enemies, she once  more glanced to right and left of her and down the two streets and the  river bank, for Paris was full of spies these days--human bloodhounds  ready for a few sous to sell their fellow-creatures' lives. It was  middle morning now, and a few passers-by were hurrying along wrapped to  the nose in mufflers, for the weather was bitterly cold.    Agnes waited until there was no one in sight, then she leaned forward  over the table and whispered under her breath:    \"They say, citizen, that you alone in Paris know the whereabouts of the  English milor'--of him who is called the Scarlet Pimpernel....\"    \"Hush-sh-sh!\" said the old man quickly, for just at that moment two men  had gone by, in ragged coats and torn breeches, who had leered at Agnes  and her neat cap and skirt as they passed. Now they had turned the angle  of the street and the old man, too, sank his voice to a whisper.    \"I know nothing of any Englishman,\" he muttered.    \"Yes, you do,\" she rejoined insistently. \"When poor Antoine Carre was  somewhere in hiding and threatened with arrest, and his mother dared not  write to him lest her letter be intercepted, she spoke to you about the  English milor', and the English milor' found Antoine Carre and took him  and his mother safely out of France. Mme. Carre is my godmother.... I  saw her the very night when she went to meet the English milor' at his  commands. I know all that happened then.... I know that you were the  intermediary.\"    \"And if I was,\" he muttered sullenly as he fiddled with his pen and  paper, \"maybe I've had cause to regret it. For a week after that Carre  episode I dared not show my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5817"],[0,"The Clockmaker — or, the Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick, of Slickville (#13)"],[1,"a bank, and says he to me arter breakfast, Major, says  he, I wish I knew where to get a real slapping trotter  of a horse, one that could trot with a flash of lightning  for a mile, and beat it by a whole neck or so. Says I,  my Lord, (for you must know, he says he's the nearest  male heir to a Scotch dormant peerage,) my Lord, says I,  I have one a proper sneezer, a chap that can go ahead of  a rail road steamer, a real natural traveller, one that  can trot with the ball out of the small eend of a rifle,  and never break into a gallop. Says he, Major, I wish  you would'nt give me that are nickname, I dont like it,  (though he looked as tickled all the time as possible,)  I never knew says he a lord that warnt a fool, that's a  fact, and that's the reason I don't go ahead and claim  the title. Well, says I, my Lord I dont know, but somehow  I cant help a thinkin, if you have a good claim, you'd  be more like a fool not to go ahead with it. Well, says  he, Lord or no Lord, let's look at your horse. So away  I went to Joe Brown's livery stable, at tother eend of  the city, and picked out the best trotter he had, and no  great stick to brag on either; says I, Joe Brown what do  you ax for that are horse? Two hundred dollars, says he;  well says I, I will take him out and try him, and if I  like him I will keep him. So I shows our Carolina Lord  the horse, and when he gets on him, says I, dont let him  trot as fast as he can, resarve that for a heat; if folks  find out how everlastin fast he is, they'd be afeared to  stump you for a start. When he returned, he said he liked  the horse amazinly, and axed the price; four hundred  dollars, says I, you cant get nothin special without a  good price, pewter cases never hold good watches; I know  it, says he, the horse is mine. Thinks I to myself,  that's more than ever I could say of him then any how.    Well, I was goin to tell you about the soup--says the  Major its near about dinner time, jist come and see how  you like the location. There was a sight of folks there,  gentlemen and ladies in the public room (I never seed so  many afore except at commencement day,) all ready for a  start, and when the gong sounded, off we sott like a  flock of sheep. Well, if there warnt a jam you may  depend--some one give me a pull, and I near abouts went  heels up over head, so I reached out both hands, and  caught hold of the first thing I could, and what should  it be but a lady's dress--well, as I'm alive, rip went  the frock, and tare goes the petticoat, and when I righted  myself from my beam eends, away they all came home to  me, and there she was, the pretty critter, with all her  upper riggin standin as far as her waist, and nothin left  below but a short linen under garment. If she didn't  scream, its a pity, and the more she screamed the more  folks larfed, for no soul could help larfin, till one of  the waiters folded her up in a table cloth. What an  awkward devil you be, Slick, says the Major, now that  comes of not falling in first, they should have formed  four deep, rear rank in open order, and marched in to  our splendid national air, and filed off to their seats  right and left shoulders forward. I feel kinder sorry,  too, says he, for that are young heifer, but she shewed  a proper pretty leg tho' Slick, didn't she--I guess you  don't often get such a chance as that are. Well I gets  near the Major at table, and afore me stood a china  utensil with two handles, full of soup, about the size  of a foot tub, with a large silver scoop in it, near  about as big as a ladle of a maple sugar kettle. I was  jist about bailing out some soup into my dish, when the  Major said fish it up from the bottom, Slick,--well, sure  enough, I gives it a drag from the bottom, and up come  the fat pieces of turtle, and the thick rich soup, and  a sight of little forced meat balls of the size of sheep's  dung. No soul could tell how good it was--it was near  about as handSUM as father's old genuine particular cider,  and that you could feel tingle clean away down to the  tip eends of your toes. Now, says the Major, I'll give  you, Slick, a new wrinkle on your horn. Folks aint thought  nothin of unless they live at Treemont: its all the go.  Do you dine at Peep's tavern every day, and then off hot  loot to Treemont, and pick your teeth on the street steps  there, and folks will think you dine there. I do it often,  and it saves two dollars a day. Then he put his finger  on his nose, and says he, \"MUM IS THE WORD.\" Now this  Province is jist like that are soup, good enough at top,  but dip down and you have the riches, the coal, the iron  ore, the gypsum, and what not. As for Halifax, its well  enough in itself, though no great shakes neither, a few  sizeable houses, with a proper sight of small ones, like  half a dozen old hens with their broods of young chickens;  but the people, the strange critters, they are all asleep.  They walk in their sleep, and talk in their sleep, and  what they say one day they forget the next, they say they  were dreaming. You know where Governor Campbell lives,  don't you, in a large stone house with a great wall round  it, that looks like a state prison; well, near hand there  is a nasty dirty horrid lookin buryin ground there--its  filled with large grave rats as big as kittens, and the  springs of black water there, go through the chinks of  the rocks and flow into all the wells, and fairly pyson  the folks--its a dismal place, I tell you--I wonder the  air from it don't turn all the silver in the Gineral's  house of a brass color, (and folks say he has four cart  loads of it) its so everlastin bad--its near about as  nosey as a slave ship of niggers. Well you may go there  and shake the folks to all etarnity and you wont wake  em, I guess, and yet there ant much difference atween  their sleep and the folks at Halifax, only they lie still  there and are quiet, and don't walk and talk in their  sleep like them above ground.    Halifax reminds me of a Russian officer I once seed at  Warsaw; he had lost both arms in battle: but I guess I  must tell you first why I went there, cause that will  show you how we speculate. One Sabbath day, after bell  ringin, when most of the women had gone to meetin (for  they were great hands for pretty sarmons, and our Unitarian  ministers all preach poetry, only they leave the ryme  out, it sparkles like perry,) I goes down to East India  wharf to see Captain Zeek Hancock, of Nantucket, to  enquire how oil was, and if it it would bear doing any  thing in; when who should come along but Jabish Green.  Slick, says he, how do you do; isn't this as pretty a  day as you'll see between this and Norfolk; it whips  English weather by a long chalk; and then he looked down  at my watch seals, and looked and looked as if he thought  I'd stole 'em. At last he looks up, and says he, Slick,  I suppose you would'nt go to Warsaw, would you, if it  was made worth your while? Which Warsaw? says I, for I  believe in my heart we have a hundred of them. None of  ourn at all, says he; Warsaw in Poland. Well, I don't  know, says I; what do you call worth while? Six dollars  a day, expenses paid, and a bonus of one thousand dollars,  if speculation turns out well. I am off, says I, whenever  you say go. Tuesday, says he, in the Hamburgh packet.  Now, says he, I'm in a tarnation hurry; I'm goin a  pleasurin to-day in the Custom House Boat, along with  Josiah Bradford's galls down to Nahant. But I'll tell  you what I am at: the Emperor of Russia has ordered the  Poles to cut off their queues on the 1st of January; you  must buy them all up, and ship them off to London for  the wig makers. Human hair is scarce and risin. Lord a  massy! says I, how queer they will look, wont they.  Well, I vow, that's what the sea folks call sailing UNDER  BARE POLES, come true, aint it? I guess it will turn out  a good spec, says he; and a good one it did turn out--  he cleared ten thousand dollars by it. When I was at  Warsaw, as I was a sayin, there was a Russian officer  there who had lost both his arms in battle; a good natured  contented critter, as I een amost ever see'd, and he was  fed with spoons by his neighbors, but arter awhile they  grew tired of it, and I guess he near about starved to  death at last. Now Halifax is like that are SPOONEY, as  I used to call him; it is fed by the outports, and they  begin to have enough to do to feed themselves--it must  larn to live without 'em. They have no river, and no  country about them; let them make a rail road to Minas  Basin, and they will have arms of their own to feed  themselves with. If they don't do it, and do it soon, I  guess they'll get into a decline that no human skill will  cure. They are proper thin now; you can count their ribs  een a most as far as you can see them. The only thing  that will either make or save Halifax, is a rail road  across the country to Bay of Fundy.    It will do to talk of, says one; you'll see it some day  says another; yes, says a third, it will come, but we  are too young yet. Our old minister had a darter, a real  clever lookin gall as you'd see in a day's ride, and she  had two or three offers of marriage from sponsible  men--most particular good specs--but minister always said  'Phoebe, you are too young--the day will come--but you  are too young yet dear.' Well, Phoebe did'nt think so at  all; she said she guessed she knew better nor that: so  the next offer she had, she said she had no notion to  lose another chance--off she sot to Rhode Island and got  married; says she, father's too old, he don't know. That's  jist the case at Halifax. The old folks say the country  is too young--the time will come, and so on; and in the  mean time the young folks won't wait, and run off to the  States, where the maxim is, 'youth is the time for  improvement; a new country is never too young for  exertion--push on--keep movin--go ahead.' Darn it all,  said the Clockmaker,"]]]
