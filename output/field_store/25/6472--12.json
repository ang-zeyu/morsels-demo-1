We had been hit in the casing, well forward, and, as was  subsequently proved when we dived, little material damage was caused to  the boat.    This enemy success caused a temporary cessation of fire. The two  wounded men were cautiously making their way aft to the conning tower,  and I called for a couple of stokers to come up and carry away the  third, when Von Weissman suddenly gave the order to dive. The gun's  crew at once made a rush for the conning tower, and were down the hatch  in a trice, one of the wounded men fainting at the bottom.    I was unaware as to the reason of this order to dive, and thought that  perhaps the Captain had sighted a periscope. As I was turning to  precede him down the conning tower hatch I distinctly saw the man lying  by the gun lift his hand. I felt I could not leave him there, and  instinctively cried, \"He is still alive!\" But Von Weissman, who was  urging the crew to hurry down the hatch, pressed the diving alarm as  soon as the last sailor was half in the hatch.    I knew that this meant that the boat would be under in 30 to 40  seconds, so I had no alternative but to get down the hatch as quickly  as possible.    I did so with reluctance, and I was followed by Von Weissman, who  joined me in the upper conning tower.    I forced myself not to look out of the conning tower scuttles during  the few seconds that elapsed as the casing slowly went under, until at  last nothing but waving green water showed at each little window. I  feared that, if I had looked, I would have seen a wounded man, stung  into activity by the cold touch of the Atlantic. Perhaps Von Weissman  read my thoughts, or else he remembered my remark concerning the man,  for he turned to me and in level tones said:    \"Have you any doubt that he was dead?\"    I hesitated a moment, and he continued:    \"By my direction you have no doubt. He _was_!\"    How brutal war is, and what a perfect exponent of the art the Captain  proves himself to be! To me a life is a life, a particle of the thing  divine; to him a life is a unit, and a half-maimed and probably dying  seaman is as nothing in the scales when the safety of a U-boat is at  stake. The seamen are numbered in their tens of thousands, the U-boats  in their tens. The steamer had hit us once, luckily only in the casing,  a second hit might well have punctured the pressure hull, and our fate  in these waters would have been certain. Therefore, having summed these  things up and balanced them in his mind, he dived and the sailor died.    Once below water Von Weissman seemed more his imperturbable self, and  unless I am mistaken he is never really happy on the surface, at least  when in action. He is a true water mole.           *       *       *       *       *    A day full of interest, though once again I have had to force myself to  absorb the horrors of War. I imagine that I am now going through the  experiences of a new arrival on the Western Front, who feels a desire  to shudder at the sight of every corpse.    At 10 a.m. this morning we sighted the topsails of a sailing boat to  the southwest. Closing her on the surface, we approached to within  about 6,000 metres, when suddenly Von Weissman ordered \"Gun Action  Stations.\"    The gun crew came tumbling up, but not quick enough to suit him, for as  they were mustering at the gun he gave the order to dive, only,  however, taking her down to periscope depth before instantly ordering  surface and then \"Gun Action Stations\" again. This time we opened fire  on the ship, which was a Norwegian barque and, being in the barred  zone, liable to destruction.    Von Weissman had announced overnight that at the first opportunity he  would give \"that ---- gun's crew a bellyful of practice,\" and he  certainly did. As soon as the first shot was fired, she backed her  topsails, and when our fourth shot struck her, somewhere near the foot  of the foremast, her crew could be seen hastily abandoning their ship.    This action on their part had no influence with Von Weissman, who had  taken personal charge of the helm, and, with the engines running at  three-quarter speed, he was zigzagging about, to make it harder for the  gun's crew. Every now and then he flung a gibe at the crew, such as  suggesting that they should go back to the High Seas Fleet and learn  how to shoot.    The sailing ship was soon on fire, for, considering the circumstances,  the shooting was very fair, though had I been controlling it I could  have confidently guaranteed better results. When she was blazing nicely  fore and aft, Von Weissman ordered the practice to cease, and sent the  crew below. He then ordered course south, speed ten knots, and I took  over the watch.    An hour and a half later, when the navigator gave me a spell, a black  cloud on the northern horizon marked the funeral pyre of another of our  victims. When I went below, the Captain had just finished playing with  his precious old chart.           *       *       *       *       *    We received a message at 2 a.m. last night from Heligoland to return  forthwith; it is now 2 a.m. and we are approaching the redoubtable  Dover Barrage. We had no trouble coming up channel to-day, which seems  singularly empty, at any rate in mid-channel, where we were.           *       *       *       *       *    We got back about three hours ago, and as I was appointed temporary to  the boat, Von Weissman kindly allowed me to leave her and come up to  Bruges as soon as we got into the shelters at Zeebrugge.    I got up here just, in time for a late dinner. Hunger satisfied, I  retired to my room and, needless to say, at once rang up my darling  Zoe.    By the mercy of providence she was in, but imagine my sensations when I  heard that that accursed swine of a Colonel was also back from the  front, and expected in at the flat at any moment, being then, she  thought, engaged in his after dinner drinking bouts at the cavalry  officers' club. I could only groan.    A laugh at the other end stung me to furious rage, appeased in an  instant by her soothing tones as she told me that I should be glad to  hear that he was only up from the Somme on a four-days leave, and was  returning next morning by the 8 a.m. troop train. Glad! I could have  danced for joy. I breathed again.    As the Colonel was expected back at any moment she thought it advisable  to terminate the conversation, which was done with obvious reluctance  on her part, or so I flatter myself.    He goes to-morrow, so far so good, but what of the intervening period?    Could any more refined torture be imagined than that I, who love her as  I love my own soul, should have to sit here, whilst scarcely a mile  away, probably at this very moment as I write, that gross brute is  privileged to kiss her, to look at her, to--oh! it's unbearable. When I  think of that hog, for though I've never seen him, I've seen his  photograph, and I know instinctively that he _is_ gross, fresh, as she  says, from a drinking bout, should at this moment be permitted to raise  his pigs' eyes and look into those glorious wells of violet light; when  I think that his is the privilege to see those masses of black hair  fall in uncontrolled splendour, then I understand to the full the deep  pleasures of murder.    I would give anything to destroy this man, and could shake the  Englishman by the hand who fires the delivering bullet!    Steady! Steady! What do I write? No! I mean it, every word of it. Yet  of all the mysteries, and to me Zoe is a mass of them, surely the  strangest of all is contained in the question: Why does she live with  him?    She doesn't love him, she's practically told me so. In fact, I know she  doesn't. Let me reason it out by logic. She lives with him, whether  voluntarily or involuntarily. Suppose it be voluntarily, then her  reasons must be (a) Love; (b) Fascination; (c) Some secret reason. If  she is living with him involuntarily it must be: (d) He has a hold on  her; (e) For financial reasons.    I strike out at once (a) and (e), for in the case of (e) she knows well  that I would provide for her, and (a) I refuse to admit, (b) is hardly  credible--I eliminate that. I am left with (c) and (d) which might be  the same thing. But what hold can he have on her; she can't have a  past, she is too young and sweet for that.    I must find out about this before I go to sea again.           *       *       *       *       *    Three days ago, I was racking my brains for the solution of a problem,  and, as I see from what I wrote, I was somewhat outside myself. In the  interval things have taken an amazing turn. I am still bewildered--but  I must put it all down from the beginning.    The Colonel left as she said he would, and I went round to lunch with  her.    We had a delightful _tete-a-tete_, and after lunch she played the  piano. I was feeling in splendid voice and she accompanied me to  perfection in Tchaikowsky's \"To the Forest,\" always a favourite of  mine. As the last chords died away, Zoe jumped up from the piano and,  with eyes dancing with excitement, placed her hands on my shoulders and  exclaimed:    \"Karl! I have an idea! I shall make a prisoner of you for two or three  days.\"    I laughed heartily and almost told her that she had already made me a  prisoner for life, only I can never get those sort of remarks out quick  enough.    But when she said, \"No! I am not joking, I mean it,\" I felt there was  more meaning in her sentence than I had at first thought. I begged to  be enlightened, and she then unfolded her scheme.    She told me for the first time, that in a forest not far from Bruges  she had a little summer-house, to which she used to retreat for  week-ends in the hot weather when the Colonel was away. He knew nothing  of this country house (she was very insistent on that point), so I  imagined she paid for it out of her dress allowance or in some other  way.

I have never before seen  such a complete defeat of the land. A little more and the water will be  right inside the cottages, and their occupants will have to put up  _machans_ to live on. The cows will die if they have to remain  standing like this in water up to their knees. All the snakes have been  flooded out of their holes, and they, with sundry other homeless reptiles  and insects, will have to chum with man and take refuge on the thatch of  his roof.    The vegetation rotting in the water, refuse of all kinds floating about,  naked children with shrivelled limbs and enlarged spleens splashing  everywhere, the long-suffering patient housewives exposed in their wet  clothes to wind and rain, wading through their daily tasks with tucked-up  skirts, and over all a thick pall of mosquitoes hovering in the noxious  atmosphere--the sight is hardly pleasing!    Colds and fevers and rheumatism in every home, the malaria-stricken  infants constantly crying,--nothing can save them. How is it possible for  men to live in such unlovely, unhealthy, squalid, neglected surroundings?  The fact is we are so used to bear everything, hands down,--the ravages of  Nature, the oppression of rulers, the pressure of our _shastras_ to  which we have not a word to say, while they keep eternally grinding us  down.          ON THE WAY TO BOALIA,    _22nd September 1894._      It feels strange to be reminded that only thirty-two Autumns have come and  gone in my life; for my memory seems to have receded back into the dimness  of time immemorial; and when my inner world is flooded with a light, as of  an unclouded autumn morning, I feel I am sitting at the window of some  magic palace, gazing entranced on a scene of distant reminiscence, soothed  with soft breezes laden with the faint perfume of all the Past.    Goethe on his death-bed wanted \"more light.\" If I have any desire left at  all at such a time, it will be for \"more space\" as well; for I dearly love  both light and space. Many look down on Bengal as being only a flat  country, but that is just what makes me revel in its scenery all the more.  Its unobstructed sky is filled to the brim, like an amethyst cup, with the  descending twilight and peace of the evening; and the golden skirt of the  still, silent noonday spreads over the whole of it without let or  hindrance.    Where is there another such country for the eye to look on, the mind to  take in?          CALCUTTA,    _5th October 1894._      To-morrow is the Durga Festival. As I was going to S----'s yesterday, I  noticed images being made in almost every big house on the way. It struck  me that during these few days of the Poojahs, old and young alike had  become children.    When we come to think of it, all preparation for enjoyment is really a  playing with toys which are of no consequence in themselves. From outside  it may appear wasteful, but can that be called futile which raises such a  wave of feeling through and through the country? Even the driest of  worldly-wise people are moved out of their self-centred interests by the  rush of the pervading emotion.    Thus, once every year there comes a period when all minds are in a melting  mood, fit for the springing of love and affection and sympathy. The songs  of welcome and farewell to the goddess, the meeting of loved ones, the  strains of the festive pipes, the limpid sky and molten gold of autumn,  are all parts of one great paean of joy.    Pure joy is the children's joy. They have the power of using any and every  trivial thing to create their world of interest, and the ugliest doll is  made beautiful with their imagination and lives with their life. He who  can retain this faculty of enjoyment after he has grown up, is indeed the  true Idealist. For him things are not merely visible to the eye or audible  to the ear, but they are also sensible to the heart, and their narrowness  and imperfections are lost in the glad music which he himself supplies.    Every one cannot hope to be an Idealist, but a whole people approaches  nearest to this blissful state at such seasons of festivity. And then what  may ordinarily appear to be a mere toy loses its limitations and becomes  glorified with an ideal radiance.          BOLPUR,    _19th October 1894._      We know people only in dotted outline, that is to say, with gaps in our  knowledge which we have to fill in ourselves, as best we can. Thus, even  those we know well are largely made up of our imagination. Sometimes the  lines are so broken, with even the guiding dots missing, that a portion of  the picture remains darkly confused and uncertain. If, then, our best  friends are only pieces of broken outline strung on a thread of  imagination, do we really know anybody at all, or does anybody know us  except in the same disjointed fashion? But perhaps it is these very  loopholes, allowing entrance to each other's imagination, which make for  intimacy; otherwise each one, secure in his inviolate individuality, would  have been unapproachable to all but the Dweller within.    Our own self, too, we know only in bits, and with these scraps of material  we have to shape the hero of our life-story,--likewise with the help of  our imagination. Providence has, doubtless, deliberately omitted portions  so that we may assist in our own creation.          BOLPUR,    _31st October 1894._      The first of the north winds has begun to blow to-day, shiveringly. It  looks as if there had been a visitation of the tax-gatherer in the  _Amlaki_ groves,--everything beside itself, sighing, trembling,  withering. The tired impassiveness of the noonday sunshine, with its  monotonous cooing of doves in the dense shade of the mango-tops, seems to  overcast the drowsy watches of the day with a pang, as of some impending  parting.    The ticking of the clock on my table, and the pattering of the squirrels  which scamper in and out of my room, are in harmony with all other midday  sounds.    It amuses me to watch these soft, grey and black striped, furry squirrels,  with their bushy tails, their twinkling bead-like eyes, their gentle yet  busily practical demeanour. Everything eatable has to be put away in the  wire-gauze cupboard in the corner, safe from these greedy creatures. So,  sniffing with an irrepressible eagerness, they come nosing round and round  the cupboard, trying to find some hole for entrance. If any grain or crumb  has been dropped outside they are sure to find it, and, taking it between  their forepaws, nibble away with great industry, turning it over and over  to adjust it to their mouths. At the least movement of mine up go their  tails over their backs and off they run, only to stop short half-way, sit  up on their tails on the door-mat, scratching their ears with their  hind-paws, and then come back.    Thus little sounds continue all day long--gnawing teeth, scampering feet,  and the tinkling of the china on the shelves.          SHELIDAH,    _7th December 1894._      As I walk on the moonlit sands, S---- usually comes up for a business  talk.    He came last evening; and when silence fell upon me after the talk was  over, I became aware of the eternal universe standing before me in the  evening light. The trivial chatter of one person had been enough to  obscure the presence of its all-pervading manifestation.    As soon as the patter of words came to an end, the peace of the stars  descended, and filled my heart to overflowing. I found my seat in one  corner, with these assembled millions of shining orbs, in the great  mysterious conclave of Being.    I have to start out early in the evening so as to let my mind absorb the  tranquillity outside, before S---- comes along with his jarring inquiries  as to whether the milk has agreed with me, and if I have finished going  through the Annual Statement.    How curiously placed are we between the Eternal and the Ephemeral! Any  allusion to the affairs of the stomach sounds so hopelessly discordant  when the mind is dwelling on the things of the spirit,--and yet the soul  and the stomach have been living together so long. The very spot on which  the moonlight falls is my landed property, but the moonlight tells me that  my _zamindari_ is an illusion, and my _zamindari_ tells me that  this moonlight is all emptiness. And as for poor me, I remain distracted  between the two.          SHELIDAH,    _23rd February_ 1895.      I grow quite absent-minded when I try to write for the _Sadhana_  magazine.    I raise my eyes to every passing boat and keep staring at the ferry going  to and fro. And then on the bank, close to my boat, there are a herd of  buffaloes thrusting their massive snouts into the herbage, wrapping their  tongues round it to get it into their mouths, and then munching away,  blowing hard with great big gasps of contentment, and flicking the flies  off their backs with their tails.    All of a sudden a naked weakling of a human cub appears on the scene,  makes sundry noises, and pokes one of the patient beasts with a cudgel,  whereupon, throwing occasional glances at the human sprig out of a corner  of its eye, and snatching at tufts of leaves or grass here and there on  the way, the unruffled beast leisurely moves on a few paces, and that imp  of a boy seems to feel that his duty as herdsman has been done.    I fail to penetrate this mystery of the boy-cowherd's mind. Whenever a cow  or a buffalo has selected a spot to its liking and is comfortably grazing  there, I cannot divine what purpose is served by worrying it, as he  insists on doing, till it shifts somewhere else. I suppose it is man's  masterfulness glorying in triumph over the powerful creature it has tamed.  Anyhow, I love to see these buffaloes amongst the lush grass.    But this is not what I started to say. I wanted to tell you how the least  thing distracts me nowadays from my duty to the _Sadhana_. In my last  letter["]]]
