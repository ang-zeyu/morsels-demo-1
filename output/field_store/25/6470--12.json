The sons of Uisnech are dead and they will trouble  you no more; and you have your wife hale and whole to yourself.\"    \"Blessings for that upon you and may the good results accrue to me,  Duanan. I count it no loss what I spent in the schooling and teaching  of you. Now dry up the flood, and let me see if I can behold Deirdre,\"  said Connachar. And Duanan Gacha Druid dried up the flood from the  plain and the three sons of Uisnech were lying together dead, without  breath of life, side by side on the green meadow plain and Deirdre  bending above showering down her tears.    Then Deirdre said this lament: \"Fair one, loved one, flower of beauty;  beloved upright and strong; beloved noble and modest warrior. Fair one,  blue-eyed, beloved of thy wife; lovely to me at the trysting-place came  thy clear voice through the woods of Ireland. I cannot eat or smile  henceforth. Break not to-day, my heart: soon enough shall I lie within  my grave. Strong are the waves of sorrow, but stronger is sorrow's  self, Connachar.\"    The people then gathered round the heroes' bodies and asked Connachar  what was to be done with the bodies. The order that he gave was that  they should dig a pit and put the three brothers in it side by side.    Deirdre kept sitting on the brink of the grave, constantly asking the  gravediggers to dig the pit wide and free. When the bodies of the  brothers were put in the grave, Deirdre said:--      Come over hither, Naois, my love,    Let Arden close to Allen lie;    If the dead had any sense to feel,    Ye would have made a place for Deirdre.    The men did as she told them. She jumped into the grave and lay down by  Naois, and she was dead by his side.    The king ordered the body to be raised from out the grave and to be  buried on the other side of the loch. It was done as the king bade, and  the pit closed. Thereupon a fir shoot grew out of the grave of Deirdre  and a fir shoot from the grave of Naois, and the two shoots united in a  knot above the loch. The king ordered the shoots to be cut down, and  this was done twice, until, at the third time, the wife whom the king  had married caused him to stop this work of evil and his vengeance on  the remains of the dead.          MUNACHAR AND MANACHAR    There once lived a Munachar and a Manachar, a long time ago, and it is  a long time since it was, and if they were alive now they would not be  alive then. They went out together to pick raspberries, and as many as  Munachar used to pick Manachar used to eat. Munachar said he must go  look for a rod to make a gad to hang Manachar, who ate his raspberries  every one; and he came to the rod. \"What news the day?\" said the rod.  \"It is my own news that I'm seeking. Going looking for a rod, a rod to  make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one.\"    \"You will not get me,\" said the rod, \"until you get an axe to cut me.\"  He came to the axe. \"What news to-day?\" said the axe. \"It's my own news  I'm seeking. Going looking for an axe, an axe to cut a rod, a rod to  make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one.\"    \"You will not get me,\" said the axe, \"until you get a flag to edge me.\"  He came to the flag. \"What news today?\" says the flag. \"It's my own  news I'm seeking. Going looking for a flag, flag to edge axe, axe to  cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my  raspberries every one.\"    \"You will not get me,\" says the flag, \"till you get water to wet me.\"  He came to the water. \"What news to-day?\" says the water. \"It's my own  news that I'm seeking. Going looking for water, water to wet flag, flag  to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang  Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one.\"    \"You will not get me,\" said the water, \"until you get a deer who will  swim me.\" He came to the deer. \"What news to-day?\" says the deer. \"It's  my own news I'm seeking. Going looking for a deer, deer to swim water,  water to wet flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a  gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one.\"    \"You will not get me,\" said the deer, \"until you get a hound who will  hunt me.\" He came to the hound. \"What news to-day?\" says the hound.  \"It's my own news I'm seeking. Going looking for a hound, hound to hunt  deer, deer to swim water, water to wet flag, flag to edge axe, axe to  cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my  raspberries every one.\"    \"You will not get me,\" said the hound, \"until you get a bit of butter  to put in my claw.\" He came to the butter. \"What news to-day?\" says the  butter. \"It's my own news I'm seeking. Going looking for butter, butter  to go in claw of hound, hound to hunt deer, deer to swim water, water  to wet flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a  gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one.\"    \"You will not get me,\" said the butter, \"until you get a cat who shall  scrape me.\" He came to the cat. \"What news to-day?\" said the cat. \"It's  my own news I'm seeking. Going looking for a cat, cat to scrape butter,  butter to go in claw of hound, hound to hunt deer, deer to swim water,  water to wet flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a  gad, gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one.\"    \"You will not get me,\" said the cat, \"until you will get milk which you  will give me.\" He came to the cow. \"What news to-day?\" said the cow.  \"It's my own news I'm seeking. Going looking for a cow, cow to give me  milk, milk I will give to the cat, cat to scrape butter, butter to go  in claw of hound, hound to hunt deer, deer to swim water, water to wet  flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to  hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one.\"    \"You will not get any milk from me,\" said the cow, \"until you bring me  a whisp of straw from those threshers yonder.\" He came to the  threshers. \"What news to-day?\" said the threshers. \"It's my own news  I'm seeking. Going looking for a whisp of straw from ye to give to the  cow, the cow to give me milk, milk I will give to the cat, cat to  scrape butter, butter to go in claw of hound, hound to hunt deer, deer  to swim water, water to wet flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a  rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every  one.\"    \"You will not get any whisp of straw from us,\" said the threshers,  \"until you bring us the makings of a cake from the miller over yonder.\"  He came to the miller. \"What news to-day?\" said the miller. \"It's my  own news I'm seeking. Going looking for the makings of a cake which I  will give to the threshers, the threshers to give me a whisp of straw,  the whisp of straw I will give to the cow, the cow to give me milk,  milk I will give to the cat, cat to scrape butter, butter to go in claw  of hound, hound to hunt deer, deer to swim water, water to wet flag,  flag to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang  Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one.\"    \"You will not get any makings of a cake from me,\" said the miller,  \"till you bring me the full of that sieve of water from the river over  there.\"    He took the sieve in his hand and went over to the river, but as often  as ever he would stoop and fill it with water, the moment he raised it  the water would run out of it again, and sure, if he had been there  from that day till this, he never could have filled it. A crow went  flying by him, over his head. \"Daub! daub!\" said the crow.    \"My blessings on ye, then,\" said Munachar, \"but it's the good advice  you have,\" and he took the red clay and the daub that was by the brink,  and he rubbed it to the bottom of the sieve, until all the holes were  filled, and then the sieve held the water, and he brought the water to  the miller, and the miller gave him the makings of a cake, and he gave  the makings of the cake to the threshers, and the threshers gave him a  whisp of straw, and he gave the whisp of straw to the cow, and the cow  gave him milk, the milk he gave to the cat, the cat scraped the butter,  the butter went into the claw of the hound, the hound hunted the deer,  the deer swam the water, the water wet the flag, the flag sharpened the  axe, the axe cut the rod, and the rod made a gad, and when he had it  ready to hang Manachar he found that Manachar had BURST.          GOLD-TREE AND SILVER-TREE    Once upon a time there was a king who had a wife, whose name was  Silver-tree, and a daughter, whose name was Gold-tree. On a certain day  of the days, Gold-tree and Silver-tree went to a glen, where there was  a well, and in it there was a trout.    Said Silver-tree, \"Troutie, bonny little fellow, am not I the most  beautiful queen in the world?\"    \"Oh! indeed you are not.\"    \"Who then?\"    \"Why, Gold-tree, your daughter.\"    Silver-tree went home, blind with rage. She lay down on the bed, and  vowed she would never be well until she could get the heart and the  liver of Gold-tree, her daughter, to eat.    At nightfall the king came home, and it was told him that Silver-tree,  his wife, was very ill. He went where she was, and asked her what was  wrong with her.    \"Oh! only a thing--which you may heal if you like.\"    \"Oh! indeed there is nothing at all which I could do for you that I  would not do.\"    \"If I get the heart and the liver of Gold-tree, my daughter, to eat, I  shall be well.\"    Now it happened about this time that the son of a great king had come  from abroad to ask Gold-tree for marrying. The king now agreed to this,  and they went abroad.    The king then went and sent his lads to the hunting-hill for a he-goat,  and he gave its heart and its liver to his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7896"],[0,"The Eight Strokes of the Clock (#13)"],[1,"stries, the well-bound books and  pretty knick-knacks denoted a love of art and a seeking after style in Jean  Louis. This room was really his. In the adjoining apartments on either  side, through the open doors, Renine was able to note the bad taste of the  two mothers.    He went up to Jean Louis and, in a low voice, asked:    \"Are they well off?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you?\"    \"They settled the manor-house upon me, with all the land around it, which  makes me quite independent.\"    \"Have they any relations?\"    \"Sisters, both of them.\"    \"With whom they could go to live?\"    \"Yes; and they have sometimes thought of doing so. But there can't be any  question of that. Once more, I assure you....\"    Meantime the car had returned. The two women jumped up hurriedly, ready to  speak.    \"Leave it to me,\" said Renine, \"and don't be surprised by anything that I  say. It's not a matter of asking her questions but of frightening her, of  flurrying her.... The sudden attack,\" he added between his teeth.    The car drove round the lawn and drew up outside the windows. Hortense  sprang out and helped an old woman to alight, dressed in a fluted linen  cap, a black velvet bodice and a heavy gathered skirt.    The old woman entered in a great state of alarm. She had a pointed face,  like a weasel's, with a prominent mouth full of protruding teeth.    \"What's the matter, Madame d'Imbleval?\" she asked, timidly stepping into  the room from which the doctor had once driven her. \"Good day to you,  Madame Vaurois.\"    The ladies did not reply. Renine came forward and said, sternly:    \"Mlle. Boussignol, I have been sent by the Paris police to throw light  upon a tragedy which took place here twenty-seven years ago. I have just  secured evidence that you have distorted the truth and that, as the result  of your false declarations, the birth-certificate of one of the children  born in the course of that night is inaccurate. Now false declarations in  matters of birth-certificates are misdemeanours punishable by law. I shall  therefore be obliged to take you to Paris to be interrogated ... unless  you are prepared here and now to confess everything that might repair the  consequences of your offence.\"    The old maid was shaking in every limb. Her teeth were chattering. She was  evidently incapable of opposing the least resistance to Renine.    \"Are you ready to confess everything?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" she panted.    \"Without delay? I have to catch a train. The business must be settled  immediately. If you show the least hesitation, I take you with me. Have  you made up your mind to speak?\"    \"Yes.\"    He pointed to Jean Louis:    \"Whose son is this gentleman? Madame d'Imbleval's?\"    \"No.\"    \"Madame Vaurois', therefore?\"    \"No.\"    A stupefied silence welcomed the two replies.    \"Explain yourself,\" Renine commanded, looking at his watch.    Then Madame Boussignol fell on her knees and said, in so low and dull a  voice that they had to bend over her in order to catch the sense of what  she was mumbling:    \"Some one came in the evening ... a gentleman with a new-born baby wrapped  in blankets, which he wanted the doctor to look after. As the doctor wasn't  there, he waited all night and it was he who did it all.\"    \"Did what?\" asked Renine. \"What did he do? What happened?\"    \"Well, what happened was that it was not one child but the two of them that  died: Madame d'Imbleval's and Madame Vaurois' too, both in convulsions.  Then the gentleman, seeing this, said, 'This shows me where my duty lies. I  must seize this opportunity of making sure that my own boy shall be happy  and well cared for. Put him in the place of one of the dead children.' He  offered me a big sum of money, saying that this one payment would save him  the expense of providing for his child every month; and I accepted. Only, I  did not know in whose place to put him and whether to say that the boy was  Louis d'Imbleval or Jean Vaurois. The gentleman thought a moment and said  neither. Then he explained to me what I was to do and what I was to say  after he had gone. And, while I was dressing his boy in vest and binders  the same as one of the dead children, he wrapped the other in the blankets  he had brought with him and went out into the night.\"    Mlle. Boussignol bent her head and wept. After a moment, Renine said:    \"Your deposition agrees with the result of my investigations.\"    \"Can I go?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And is it over, as far as I'm concerned? They won't be talking about this  all over the district?\"    \"No. Oh, just one more question: do you know the man's name?\"    \"No. He didn't tell me his name.\"    \"Have you ever seen him since?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Have you anything more to say?\"    \"No.\"    \"Are you prepared to sign the written text of your confession?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Very well. I shall send for you in a week or two. Till then, not a word to  anybody.\"    He saw her to the door and closed it after her. When he returned, Jean  Louis was between the two old ladies and all three were holding hands. The  bond of hatred and wretchedness which had bound them had suddenly snapped;  and this rupture, without requiring them to reflect upon the matter, filled  them with a gentle tranquillity of which they were hardly conscious, but  which made them serious and thoughtful.    \"Let's rush things,\" said Renine to Hortense. \"This is the decisive moment  of the battle. We must get Jean Louis on board.\"    Hortense seemed preoccupied. She whispered:    \"Why did you let the woman go? Were you satisfied with her statement?\"    \"I don't need to be satisfied. She told us what happened. What more do you  want?\"    \"Nothing.... I don't know....\"    \"We'll talk about it later, my dear. For the moment, I repeat, we must get  Jean Louis on board. And immediately.... Otherwise....\"    He turned to the young man:    \"You agree with me, don't you, that, things being as they are, it is best  for you and Madame Vaurois and Madame d'Imbleval to separate for a time?  That will enable you all to see matters more clearly and to decide in  perfect freedom what is to be done. Come with us, monsieur. The most  pressing thing is to save Genevieve Aymard, your _fiancee_.\"    Jean Louis stood perplexed and undecided. Renine turned to the two women:    \"That is your opinion too, I am sure, ladies?\"    They nodded.    \"You see, monsieur,\" he said to Jean Louis, \"we are all agreed. In great  crises, there is nothing like separation ... a few days' respite. Quickly  now, monsieur.\"    And, without giving him time to hesitate, he drove him towards his bedroom  to pack up.    Half an hour later, Jean Louis left the manor-house with his new friends.    \"And he won't go back until he's married,\" said Renine to Hortense, as they  were waiting at Carhaix station, to which the car had taken them, while  Jean Louis was attending to his luggage. \"Everything's for the best. Are  you satisfied?\"    \"Yes, Genevieve will be glad,\" she replied, absently.    When they had taken their seats in the train, Renine and she repaired to  the dining-car. Renine, who had asked Hortense several questions to which  she had replied only in monosyllables, protested:    \"What's the matter with you, my child? You look worried!\"    \"I? Not at all!\"    \"Yes, yes, I know you. Now, no secrets, no mysteries!\"    She smiled:    \"Well, since you insist on knowing if I am satisfied, I am bound to  admit that of course I am ... as regards my friend Genevieve, but that,  in another respect--from the point of view of the adventure--I have an  uncomfortable sort of feeling....\"    \"To speak frankly, I haven't 'staggered' you this time?\"    \"Not very much.\"    \"I seem to you to have played a secondary part. For, after all, what have I  done? We arrived. We listened to Jean Louis' tale of woe. I had a midwife  fetched. And that was all.\"    \"Exactly. I want to know if that _was_ all; and I'm not quite sure.  To tell you the truth, our other adventures left behind them an impression  which was--how shall I put it?--more definite, clearer.\"    \"And this one strikes you as obscure?\"    \"Obscure, yes, and incomplete.\"    \"But in what way?\"    \"I don't know. Perhaps it has something to do with that woman's confession.  Yes, very likely that is it. It was all so unexpected and so short.\"    \"Well, of course, I cut it short, as you can readily imagine!\" said Renine,  laughing. \"We didn't want too many explanations.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Why, if she had given her explanations with too much detail, we should  have ended by doubting what she was telling us.\"    \"By doubting it?\"    \"Well, hang it all, the story is a trifle far-fetched! That fellow arriving  at night, with a live baby in his pocket, and going away with a dead one:  the thing hardly holds water. But you see, my dear, I hadn't much time to  coach the unfortunate woman in her part.\"    Hortense stared at him in amazement:    \"What on earth do you mean?\"    \"Well, you know how dull-witted these countrywomen are. And she and I  had no time to spare. So we worked out a little scene in a hurry ... and  she really didn't act it so badly. It was all in the right key: terror,  _tremolo_, tears....\"    \"Is it possible?\" murmured Hortense. \"Is it possible? You had seen her  beforehand?\"    \"I had to, of course.\"    \"But when?\"    \"This morning, when we arrived. While you were titivating yourself at  the hotel at Carhaix, I was running round to see what information I  could pick up. As you may imagine, everybody in the district knows the  d'Imbleval-Vaurois story. I was at once directed to the former midwife,  Mlle. Boussignol. With Mlle. Boussignol it did not take long. Three minutes  to settle a new version of what had happened and ten thousand francs to  induce her to repeat that ... more or less credible ... version to the  people at the manor-house.\"    \"A quite incredible version!\"    \"Not so bad as all that, my child, seeing that you believed it ... and  the others too. And that "]]]
