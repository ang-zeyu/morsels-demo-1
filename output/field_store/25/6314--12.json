But as we look from  below, the winding outline of the hills puts this gap out of sight,  and Norma and Norba become in appearance one whole. Norma looks like  a continuation of Norba; it might pass for its still inhabited part,  perhaps, as at Syracuse and Girgenti, for the elder stronghold within  which the city had again shrunk up. From the points where the eye can  take in ruined Ninfa at the foot of the cliff, and the further town of  Sermoneta crowning a hill-top far lower than the height of Norba, the  whole grouping is wonderful. The view from Norba itself takes in points  with which we have become familiar since we first gazed on them from  the height of the Latian Jupiter. But we see them in new groupings and  new proportions; the islands, prisons for dangerous or discreditable  members of the Imperial house, stand out in special prominence in front  of the Circaean height--a height so nearly cut off from the mainland  that it seems like the greatest of the island group. Nowhere do we  better understand what men looked on as a great and strong city in days  when they had not yet learned that an element of truer might lurked  in what, judged by the standard of Norba, would seem a mere group of  molehills by the yellow Tiber.    As the whole city lay on the top of the hill, the space taken in by  the walls is necessarily greater than in those towns where the hill  stands distinct, the _arx_ alone crowns the top, and where the town  walls are placed lower down. The nature of the construction adapts  itself to the needs of the different parts of the circuit. The mass  of the wall is of polygonal stones, rude, but far less rude than the  rudest at Cori. Without being actually laid in regular order, they  have a certain tendency to fall into courses as it were of themselves,  and it is not always easy to tell how far the roughness of the stone  has been from the beginning, and how far it is due to the action of  the weather on stones cut perhaps somewhat less carefully than the  finer stones at Cori. But the Norban builders could, when it was worth  their while, do something more than this. They could, when they had  to make a corner, put together squared stones cut with a good deal of  exactness, and when it was convenient that a corner should be rounded  off, they could do that too with equal skill. This last was done at  the greatest gateway looking towards Norma. Here there is no sign  of either lintel, arch, or attempt at arch, to span the opening; it  would almost seem that the gate itself was simply placed across the  opening with nothing over it, much as at Tusculum the gate was hung  between two pieces of native rock. That the arch was not known to the  first builders of Norba, but that they had reached the stage in which  men began as it were to stretch forth their hands towards that great  invention, is shown by a ruined building--one of the few things within  the wall of Norba which can be called even a ruined building--a little  way beyond the _arx_. Here we have a distinct attempt at a vault for  the roof; but it is not the apparent cupola of Mykene and New Grange,  nor the apparent barrel-vault of Tusculum. The building is oblong, and  the attempted arches rise on both sides, from the small ones as well  as from the longer. The ruined state of the building, whatever it was,  most unluckily hinders us from seeing how the four vaults, so to call  them, were made to meet in the middle. It must have been a strange  problem in construction. Hard by is the other building at which we have  already hinted as being of later date. It has real arches and masonry,  like that which at Cori is attributed to Sulla's time. But it may as  well come before the overthrow of Norba in his day as after it.    From primaeval and forsaken Norba we go down the hill-side, learning  as we go how high Norba stands, to hardly less forsaken, though only  mediaeval, Ninfa. Ninfa, unlike Norba, has a few inhabitants; there is  a house and a mill, if not within the fortified enclosure, at least  just outside it, and, if the enclosure itself contains no actual  dwelling-places of man, it contains abundance of buildings which have  once been so. One can hardly fancy a greater contrast than that which  strikes us between the stern primaeval wall of Norba, fencing in the  thick-standing corn, and the wall of Ninfa, with its towers, its varied  and picturesque outline, fencing in a crowd of houses, churches, and  buildings of every kind, the oldest of which could not have arisen till  a thousand years after Norba became desolate. All are now forsaken,  roofless, shattered, forming one of the most singular gatherings of  ruins to be seen anywhere, the mummy, as it has been well called, of  a dead town. Ninfa was once a place of some consequence, which played  its part in local history; perhaps the most notable event suggested  by its name is that here Alexander III., a Pope who had so much to  do with our own history, was consecrated after his famous disputed  election. But its position in the deadly flat, close by a stream,  led to its ruin; the malaria was too much for it, and Ninfa ceased to  be reckoned among the cities of articulate-speaking men. Some freak  might restore the greatness of Norba; for there is nothing to hinder  men living there if the fancy took them; they cannot live at Ninfa  without greater changes than a Marius or a Sulla can work. There is  something specially striking in a town, whose remains are so extensive,  standing so utterly desolate. There is something Irish in the look  of things at Ninfa, as indeed there is in the look of a good many of  the ruined mediaeval sites which often meet us in this region. It is  not merely the fact of their being ruined, though there is something  Irish in that; the tall, slender towers, of which there are many both  at Ninfa and elsewhere, have a real likeness to many buildings in  Ireland. But, though the general look of Ninfa is singularly striking,  there is less to be learned from the particular buildings than might  have been looked for. They are spread over several centuries, some of  the houses reaching even into _Renaissance_ times. The church of most  pretension lies without the walls; several within them keep their apses  and the paintings on them, but little more. The whole is a wilderness  of ruins, strange, impressive, but hardly venerable. As the ruin of a  town, the wreck of many buildings crowded close together, fallen Ninfa  has little of the solemnity of our own ruined castles and abbeys. As  for the elements of wonder and mystery, they dwell in this region on  the hill-top, among the mighty masses of stone which the men of an  unrecorded age piled together to make Norba.          Segni.      The visitor to Segni will find difficulties in studying the history  on the spot second only to those which he finds at Norba. It is quite  certain that he will find no books at Norba, save such as he may take  with him, which are not likely to be many. It is possible that there  may be books at Segni; there may lurk in some odd corner either a  hidden scholar with his treasured library, or a bookseller of that  class, sometimes to be found in old-fashioned places, who dislikes  nothing so much as parting with his books. But, if such there be, they  do not force themselves on the eye on one's entrance into Segni. A  natural and important question is sure to present itself, and--without  wings to fly at once to the libraries of Rome--there is no immediate  means of answering it. Is the name of Signia--now by a very slight  change _Segni_--to be found in any of the lists of the Thirty Cities of  Latium? The lists are many, and the traveller is not likely to carry  them all in his head. He may perhaps be able to repeat the lines in  which Macaulay draws the picture of many of them; and, if so, every  step that he takes among the Latin cities will make him more fully  admire the fitness and force of the points and epithets picked out  in each case. But at Segni the Lay of Regillus fails him; he has his  quotations for Cora and Norba; he has no quotations for Signia. Still  Macaulay's verses are not a full or formal list of the cities; while,  if he argues that Signia lies too much in the heart of the Volscian  and Hernican land to have belonged to the Latin name, he is met by the  fact that \"Ferentinum of the rock,\" yet further on, has its place in  them alongside of \"Gabia of the pool.\" He turns to his guide-book--and  the guide-book of Gsell-fels, though it sometimes leaves things out,  is almost always to be trusted for what it puts in; he there finds only  the entry of the alleged Roman colony of the days of the Tarquins, with  the remark that the existing walls seem to point to an earlier origin.  And again a thought may occur to him, if not at Segni itself, yet in  the later course of the journey of which Segni forms a part--Were the  people of ancient Signia specially skilful in the making of mosaic  pavements? There is a kind of work called _opus Signinum_, a pattern  of black spots on a white ground, of which there is a good deal at  Pompeii, and of which the visitor to Segni will most likely see an  example a few days later at Anagni. The question is hardly so exciting  as the question as to the position of Signia in the days of the Latin  League. But it is one which may suggest itself, and it is one which  it will be hard to answer with only the resources which are to be had  at Segni itself. The visitor to Segni is thus likely to find himself  a little uncomfortable as to more than one point in the history of the  place where he stands. And he will feel most uncomfortable of all as to  the great point of all with regard to its earliest history. Still, he  may for the moment comfort himself by thinking that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],[0,"\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#13)"],[1,"pastors, and chief of them our Holy Father the Pope.\"]    The Greek Orthodox catechism says: \"The Church is a society  founded upon earth by Jesus Christ, which is united into one  whole, by one divine doctrine and by sacraments, under the rule  and guidance of a priesthood appointed by God,\" meaning by the  \"priesthood appointed by God\" the Greek Orthodox priesthood,  consisting of certain individuals who happen to be in such or such  positions.    The Lutheran catechism says: \"The Church is holy Christianity, or  the collection of all believers under Christ, their head, to whom  the Holy Ghost through the Gospels and sacraments promises,  communicates, and administers heavenly salvation,\" meaning that  the Catholic Church is lost in error, and that the true means of  salvation is in Lutheranism.    For Catholics the Church of God coincides with the Roman  priesthood and the Pope.  For the Greek Orthodox believer the  Church of God coincides with the establishment and priesthood of  Russia. [See Footnote]        [Footnote: Homyakov's definition of the Church, which      was received with some favor among Russians, does not      improve matters, if we are to agree with Homyakov in      considering the Greek Orthodox Church as the one true      Church.  Homyakov asserts that a church is a collection      of men (all without distinction of clergy and laymen)      united together by love, and that only to men united by      love is the truth revealed (let us love each other, that      in the unity of thought, etc.), and that such a church      is the church which, in the first place, recognizes the      Nicene Creed, and in the second place does not, after      the division of the churches, recognize the popes and      new dogmas.  But with such a definition of the church,      there is still more difficulty in reconciling, as      Homyakov tries to do, the church united by love with      the church that recognizes the Nicene Creed and the      doctrine of Photius.  So that Homyakov's assertion that      this church, united by love, and consequently holy,      is the same church as the Greek Orthodox priesthood      profess faith in, is even more arbitrary than the      assertions of the Catholics or the Orthodox.  If we      admit the idea of a church in the sense Homyakov      gives to it--that is, a body of men bound together      by love and truth--then all that any man can predicate      in regard to this body, if such an one exists, is      its love and truth, but there can be no outer signs      by which one could reckon oneself or another as a      member of this holy body, nor by which one could put      anyone outside it; so that no institution having      an external existence can correspond to this idea.]    For Lutherans the Church of God coincides with a body of men who  recognize the authority of the Bible and Luther's catechism.    Ordinarily, when speaking of the rise of Christianity, men  belonging to one of the existing churches use the word church in  the singular, as though there were and had been only one church.  But this is absolutely incorrect.  The Church, as an institution  which asserted that it possessed infallible truth, did not make  its appearance singly; there were at least two churches directly  this claim was made.    While believers were agreed among themselves and the body was one,  it had no need to declare itself as a church.  It was only when  believers were split up into opposing parties, renouncing one  another, that it seemed necessary to each party to confirm their  own truth by ascribing to themselves infallibility.  The  conception of one church only arose when there were two sides  divided and disputing, who each called the other side heresy, and  recognized their own side only as the infallible church.    If we knew that there was a church which decided in the year 51 to  receive the uncircumcised, it is only so because there was another  church--of the Judaists--who decided to keep the uncircumcised  out.    If there is a Catholic Church now which asserts its own infallibility,  that is only because there are churches--Greco-Russian, Old Orthodox,  and Lutheran--each asserting its own infallibility and denying that of  all other churches. So that the one Church is only a fantastic  imagination which has not the least trace of reality about it.    As a real historical fact there has existed, and still exist,  several bodies of men, each asserting that it is the one Church,  founded by Christ, and that all the others who call themselves  churches are only sects and heresies.    The catechisms of the churches of the most world-wide influence--the  Catholic, the Old Orthodox, and the Lutheran--openly assert this.    In the Catholic catechism it is said: \"Quels sont ceux qui sont  hors de l'eglise?  Les infideles, les heretiques, les  schismatiques.\" [Footnote: \"Who are those who are outside the  Church? Infidels, heretics, and schismatics.\"]  The so-called  Greek Orthodox are regarded as schismatics, the Lutherans as  heretics; so that according to the Catholic catechism the only  people in the Church are Catholics.    In the so-called Orthodox catechism it is said: By the one  Christian Church is understood the Orthodox, which remains fully  in accord with the Universal Church.  As for the Roman Church and  other sects (the Lutherans and the rest they do not even dignify  by the name of church), they cannot be included in the one true  Church, since they have themselves separated from it.    According to this definition the Catholics and Lutherans are  outside the Church, and there are only Orthodox in the Church.    The Lutheran catechism says: \"Die wahre kirche wird darein  erkannt, dass in ihr das Wort Gottes lauter und rein ohne  Menschenzusatze gelehrt and die Sacramente treu nach Christi  Einsetzung gewahret werden.\" [Footnote: \"The true Church will be  known by the Word of God being studied clear and unmixed with  man's additions and the sacraments being maintained faithful to  Christ's teaching.\"]    According to this definition all those who have added anything to  the teaching of Christ and the apostles, as the Catholic and Greek  churches have done, are outside the Church.  And in the Church  there are only Protestants.    The Catholics assert that the Holy Ghost has been transmitted  without a break in their priesthood.  The Orthodox assert that the  same Holy Ghost has been transmitted without a break in their  priesthood.  The Arians asserted that the Holy Ghost was  transmitted in their priesthood (they asserted this with just as  much right as the churches in authority now).  The Protestants of  every kind--Lutherans, Reformed Church, Presbyterians, Methodists,  Swedenborgians, Mormons--assert that the Holy Ghost is only  present in their communities.  If the Catholics assert that the  Holy Ghost, at the time of the division of the Church into Arian  and Greek, left the Church that fell away and remained in the one  true Church, with precisely the same right the Protestants of  every denomination can assert that at the time of the separation  of their Church from the Catholic the Holy Ghost left the Catholic  and passed into the Church they professed.  And this is just what  they do.    Every church traces its creed through an uninterrupted  transmission from Christ and the Apostles.  And truly every  Christian creed that has been derived from Christ must have come  down to the present generation through a certain transmission.  But that does not prove that it alone of all that has been  transmuted, excluding all the rest, can be the sole truth,  admitting of no doubt.    Every branch in a tree comes from the root in unbroken connection;  but the fact that each branch comes from the one root, does not  prove at all that each branch was the only one.  It is precisely  the same with the Church.  Every church presents exactly the same  proofs of the succession, and even the same miracles, in support  of its authenticity, as every other.  So that there is but one  strict and exact definition of what is a church (not of something  fantastic which we would wish it to be, but of what it is and has  been in reality)--a church is a body of men who claim for  themselves that they are in complete and sole possession of the  truth.  And these bodies, having in course of time, aided by the  support of the temporal authorities, developed into powerful  institutions, have been the principal obstacles to the diffusion  of a true comprehension of the teaching of Christ.    It could not be otherwise.  The chief peculiarity which  distinguished Christ's teaching from previous religions consisted  in the fact that those who accepted it strove ever more and more  to comprehend and realize its teaching.  But the Church doctrine  asserted its own complete and final comprehension and realization  of it.    Strange though it may seem to us who have been brought up in the  erroneous view of the Church as a Christian institution, and in  contempt for heresy, yet the fact is that only in what was called  heresy was there any true movement, that is, true Christianity,  and that it only ceased to be so when those heresies stopped short  in their movement and also petrified into the fixed forms of a  church.    And, indeed what is a heresy?  Read all the theological works one  after another.  In all of them heresy is the subject which first  presents itself for definition; since every theological work deals  with the true doctrine of Christ as distinguished from the  erroneous doctrines which surround it, that is, heresies.  Yet you  will not find anywhere anything like a definition of heresy.    The treatment of this subject by the learned historian of  Christianity, E. de Pressense, in his \"Histoire du Dogme\" (Paris,  1869), under the heading \"Ubi Christus, ibi Ecclesia,\" may serve  as an illustration of the complete absence of anything like a  definition of what is"]]]
