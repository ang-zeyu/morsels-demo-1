[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4339"],[0,"Nerves and Common Sense (#13)"],[1," country, a little walk out of doors is pleasanter  than in the city, for the air is better; and there is much that is  interesting, in the way of trees and sky, and stars, at night.    As you walk, make a conscious effort to look out and about you.  Forget the work of the day, and take good long breaths.    When you do not feel like going out of doors, take a story book--or  some other reading, if you prefer--and put your mind right on it for  half an hour. The use of a really good novel cannot be  overestimated. It not only serves as recreation, but it introduces  us to phases of human nature that otherwise we would know nothing  whatever about. A very great change from the day's work can be found  in a good novel and a very happy change.    If the air in the theaters were fresher and good seats did not cost  so much a good play, well acted, would be better than a good novel.  Sometimes it freshens us up to play a game after the day's work is  over, and for those who love music there is of course the greatest  rest in that. But there again comes in the question of cost.    Why does not some kind soul start concerts for the people where, for  a nominal admission, the best music can be heard? And why does not  some other kind soul start a theater for the people where, for a  very small price of admission, they can see the best plays and see  them well acted?    We have public libraries in all our cities and towns, and a  librarian in one large city loves to tell the tale of a poor woman  in the slums with her door barred with furniture for fear of the  drunken raiders in the house, quietly reading a book from the public  library.    There are many similar stories to go with that. If we had really  good theaters and really good concerts to be reached as simply and  as easily as the books in our public libraries, the healthy  influence throughout the cities would be proportionately increased.  The trouble is that people cater as much to the rich with their  ideas of a national theater as the theatrical syndicate itself.    I could not pretend to suggest amusements that would appeal to any  or every reader, but I can make my point clear that when one is  tired it is healthy to have a change of activity before going to  rest.    \"Oh,\" I hear, \"I can't! I can't! I am too tired.\"    I know the feeling.    I have no doubt the man who wrote for nearly two days had a very  strong tendency to go right to bed, but he had common sense behind  it, and he knew the result would be better if he followed his common  sense rather than his inclination. And so it proved.    It seems very hard to realize that it is not the best thing to go  right to bed or to sit and do nothing when one is so tired as to  make it seem impossible to do anything else.    It would be wrong to take vigorous physical exercise after great  brain or body fatigue, but entire change of attention and gentle  exercise is just what is needed, although care should always be  taken not to keep at it too long. Any readers who make up their  minds to try this process of resting will soon prove its happy  effect.    A quotation from a recent daily paper reads, \"'Rest while you work,'  says Annie Payson Call,\"--and then the editor adds, \"and get fired,\"  and although the opportunity for the joke was probably thought too  good to lose, it was a natural misinterpretation of a very practical  truth.    I can easily imagine a woman--especially a tired out and bitter  woman--reading directions telling how to work restfully and  exclaiming with all the vehemence of her bitterness: \"That is all  very well to write about. It sounds well, but let any one take hold  of my work and try to do it restfully.    \"If my employer should come along and see me working in a lazy way  like that, he would very soon discharge me. No, no. I am tired out;  I must keep at it as long as I can, and when I cannot keep at it any  longer, I will die--and there is the end.\"    \"It is nothing but drudge, drudge for your bread and butter--and  what does your bread and butter amount to when you get it?\"    There are thousands of women working to-day with bodies and minds so  steeped in their fatigue that they cannot or will not take an idea  outside of their rut of work. The rut has grown so deep, and they  have sunken in so far that they cannot look over the edge.    It is true that it is easier to do good hard work in the lines to  which one has been accustomed than to do easy work which is strange.  Nerves will go on in old accustomed habits--even habits of tiresome  strain--more easily than they will be changed into new habits of  working without strain.    The mind, too, gets saturated with a sense of fatigue until the  fatigue seems normal, and to feel well rested would--at first--seem  abnormal. This being a fact, it is a logical result that an  habitually tired and strained mind will indignantly refuse the idea  that it can do more work and do it better without the strain.    There is a sharp corner to be turned to learn to work without  strain, when one has had the habit of working with it. After the  corner is turned, it requires steady, careful study to understand  the new normal habit of working restfully, and to get the new habit  established.    When once it is established, this normal habit of work develops its  own requirements, and the working without strain becomes to us an  essential part of the work itself.    For taken as a whole, more work is done and the work is done better  when we avoid strain than when we do not. What is required to find  this out is common sense and strength of character.    Character grows with practice; it builds and builds on itself when  once it has a fair start, and a very little intelligence is needed  if once the will is used to direct the body and mind in the lines of  common sense.    Intelligence grows, too, as we use it. Everything good in the soul  grows with use; everything bad, destroys.    Let us make a distinction to begin with between \"rest while you  work\" and \"working restfully.\"    \"Rest while you work\" might imply laziness. There is a time for rest  and there is a time for work. When we work we should work entirely.  When we rest we should rest entirely.    If we try to mix rest and work, we do neither well. That is true.  But if we work restfully, we work then with the greatest amount of  power and the least amount of effort.    That means more work and work better done after the right habit is  established than we did before, when the wrong habit was  established. The difficulty comes, and the danger of \"getting  fired,\" when we are changing our habit.    To obviate that difficulty, we must be content to change our habit  more slowly. Suppose we come home Saturday night all tired out; go  to bed and go to sleep, and wake Sunday almost more tired than when  we went to bed. On Sunday we do not have to go to work.    Let us take a little time for the sole purpose of thinking our work  over, and trying to find where the unnecessary strain is.    \"But,\" I hear some one say, \"I am too tired to think.\" Now it is a  scientific fact that when our brains are all tired out in one  direction, if we use our wills to start them working in another  direction, they will get rested.    \"But,\" again I hear, \"if I think about my work, why isn't that  using my brain in the same direction?\" Because in thinking to apply  new principles to work, of which you have never thought before, you  are thinking in a new direction.    Not only that, but in applying new and true principles to your work  you are bringing new life into the work itself.    On this Sunday morning, when you take an hour to devote yourself to  the study of how you can work without getting overtired ask yourself  the following questions:--    (1) \"What do I resist in or about my work?\" Find out each thing that  you do resist, and drop the contractions that come in your body,  with the intention of dropping the resistances in your mind.    (2) \"Do I drop my work at meals and eat quietly?\"    (3) \"Do I take every opportunity that I can to get fresh air, and  take good, full breaths of it?\"    (4) \"Do I feel hurried and pushed in my work? Do I realize that no  matter how much of a hurry there may be, I can hurry more  effectively if I drop the strain of the hurry?\"    (5) \"How much superfluous strain do I use in my work? Do I work with  a feeling of strain? How can I observe better in order to become  conscious of the strain and drop it?\"    These are enough questions for one time! If you concentrate on these  questions and on finding the answers, and do it diligently, you will  be surprised to see how the true answers will come to you, and how  much clearer they will become as you put them into daily practice.          CHAPTER XII    _Imaginary Vacations_      ONCE a young woman who had very hard work to do day after day and  who had come to where she was chronically strained and tired, turned  to her mother just as she was starting for work in the morning, and  in a voice tense with fatigue and trouble, said:--    \"Mother, I cannot stand it. I cannot stand it. Unless I can get a  vacation long enough at least to catch my breath, I shall break down  altogether.\"    \"Why don't you take a vacation today?\" asked her mother. The  daughter got a little irritated and snapped out:---    \"Why do you say such a foolish thing as that, Mother? You know as  well as I that I could not leave my work to-day.\"    \"Don't be cross, dear. Stop a minute and let me tell you what I  mean. I have been thinking about it and I know you will appreciate  what I have to say, and I know you can do it. Now listen.\" Whereupon  the mother went on to explain quite graphically a process of  pretense--good, wholesome pretense.    To any one who has no imagination this would not or could not  appeal.    To the young woman of whom I write it not only appealed heartily,  but she tried it and made it work. It was simply that she "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4341"],[0,"Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (#13)"],[1,"exist. Separate groups of penguins have separate  resting-places and separate fishing abodes, and do not fight for them.  The droves of cattle in Australia have particular spots to which each  group repairs to rest, and from which it never deviates; and so on.(28)  We have any numbers of direct observations of the peace that prevails in  the nesting associations of birds, the villages of the rodents, and the  herds of grass-eaters; while, on the other side, we know of few sociable  animals which so continually quarrel as the rats in our cellars do, or  as the morses, which fight for the possession of a sunny place on the  shore. Sociability thus puts a limit to physical struggle, and leaves  room for the development of better moral feelings. The high development  of parental love in all classes of animals, even with lions and tigers,  is generally known. As to the young birds and mammals whom we  continually see associating, sympathy--not love--attains a further  development in their associations. Leaving aside the really touching  facts of mutual attachment and compassion which have been recorded as  regards domesticated animals and with animals kept in captivity, we have  a number of well certified facts of compassion between wild animals at  liberty. Max Perty and L. Buchner have given a number of such facts.(29)  J.C. Wood's narrative of a weasel which came to pick up and to carry  away an injured comrade enjoys a well-merited popularity.(30) So also  the observation of Captain Stansbury on his journey to Utah which is  quoted by Darwin; he saw a blind pelican which was fed, and well fed, by  other pelicans upon fishes which had to be brought from a distance of  thirty miles.(31) And when a herd of vicunas was hotly pursued by  hunters, H.A. Weddell saw more than once during his journey to Bolivia  and Peru, the strong males covering the retreat of the herd and lagging  behind in order to protect the retreat. As to facts of compassion with  wounded comrades, they are continually mentioned by all field  zoologists. Such facts are quite natural. Compassion is a necessary  outcome of social life. But compassion also means a considerable advance  in general intelligence and sensibility. It is the first step towards  the development of higher moral sentiments. It is, in its turn, a  powerful factor of further evolution.    If the views developed on the preceding pages are correct, the question  necessarily arises, in how far are they consistent with the theory of  struggle for life as it has been developed by Darwin, Wallace, and their  followers? and I will now briefly answer this important question. First  of all, no naturalist will doubt that the idea of a struggle for life  carried on through organic nature is the greatest generalization of our  century. Life is struggle; and in that struggle the fittest survive. But  the answers to the questions, \"By which arms is this struggle chiefly  carried on?\" and \"Who are the fittest in the struggle?\" will widely  differ according to the importance given to the two different aspects of  the struggle: the direct one, for food and safety among separate  individuals, and the struggle which Darwin described as  \"metaphorical\"--the struggle, very often collective, against adverse  circumstances. No one will deny that there is, within each species, a  certain amount of real competition for food--at least, at certain  periods. But the question is, whether competition is carried on to the  extent admitted by Darwin, or even by Wallace; and whether this  competition has played, in the evolution of the animal kingdom, the part  assigned to it.    The idea which permeates Darwin's work is certainly one of real  competition going on within each animal group for food, safety, and  possibility of leaving an offspring. He often speaks of regions being  stocked with animal life to their full capacity, and from that  overstocking he infers the necessity of competition. But when we look in  his work for real proofs of that competition, we must confess that we do  not find them sufficiently convincing. If we refer to the paragraph  entitled \"Struggle for Life most severe between Individuals and  Varieties of the same Species,\" we find in it none of that wealth of  proofs and illustrations which we are accustomed to find in whatever  Darwin wrote. The struggle between individuals of the same species is  not illustrated under that heading by even one single instance: it is  taken as granted; and the competition between closely-allied animal  species is illustrated by but five examples, out of which one, at least  (relating to the two species of thrushes), now proves to be  doubtful.(32) But when we look for more details in order to ascertain  how far the decrease of one species was really occasioned by the  increase of the other species, Darwin, with his usual fairness, tells  us:    \"We can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between  allied forms which fill nearly the same place in nature; but probably in  no case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over  another in the great battle of life.\"    As to Wallace, who quotes the same facts under a slightly-modified  heading (\"Struggle for Life between closely-allied Animals and Plants  often most severe\"), he makes the following remark (italics are mine),  which gives quite another aspect to the facts above quoted. He says:    \"In some cases, no doubt, there is actual war between the two, the  stronger killing the weaker. But this is by no means necessary, and  there may be cases in which the weaker species, physically, may prevail  by its power of more rapid multiplication, its better withstanding  vicissitudes of climate, or its greater cunning in escaping the attacks  of common enemies.\"    In such cases what is described as competition may be no competition at  all. One species succumbs, not because it is exterminated or starved out  by the other species, but because it does not well accommodate itself to  new conditions, which the other does. The term \"struggle for life\" is  again used in its metaphorical sense, and may have no other. As to the  real competition between individuals of the same species, which is  illustrated in another place by the cattle of South America during a  period of drought, its value is impaired by its being taken from among  domesticated animals. Bisons emigrate in like circumstances in order to  avoid competition. However severe the struggle between plants--and this  is amply proved--we cannot but repeat Wallace's remark to the effect  that \"plants live where they can,\" while animals have, to a great  extent, the power of choice of their abode. So that we again are asking  ourselves, To what extent does competition really exist within each  animal species? Upon what is the assumption based? The same remark must  be made concerning the indirect argument in favour of a severe  competition and struggle for life within each species, which may be  derived from the \"extermination of transitional varieties,\" so often  mentioned by Darwin. It is known that for a long time Darwin was worried  by the difficulty which he saw in the absence of a long chain of  intermediate forms between closely-allied species, and that he found the  solution of this difficulty in the supposed extermination of the  intermediate forms.(33) However, an attentive reading of the different  chapters in which Darwin and Wallace speak of this subject soon brings  one to the conclusion that the word \"extermination\" does not mean real  extermination; the same remark which Darwin made concerning his  expression: \"struggle for existence,\" evidently applies to the word  \"extermination\" as well. It can by no means be understood in its direct  sense, but must be taken \"in its metaphoric sense.\" If we start from the  supposition that a given area is stocked with animals to its fullest  capacity, and that a keen competition for the sheer means of existence  is consequently going on between all the inhabitants--each animal being  compelled to fight against all its congeners in order to get its daily  food--then the appearance of a new and successful variety would  certainly mean in many cases (though not always) the appearance of  individuals which are enabled to seize more than their fair share of the  means of existence; and the result would be that those individuals would  starve both the parental form which does not possess the new variation  and the intermediate forms which do not possess it in the same degree.  It may be that at the outset, Darwin understood the appearance of new  varieties under this aspect; at least, the frequent use of the word  \"extermination\" conveys such an impression. But both he and Wallace knew  Nature too well not to perceive that this is by no means the only  possible and necessary course of affairs.    If the physical and the biological conditions of a given area, the  extension of the area occupied by a given species, and the habits of all  the members of the latter remained unchanged--then the sudden appearance  of a new variety might mean the starving out and the extermination of  all the individuals which were not endowed in a sufficient degree with  the new feature by which the new variety is characterized. But such a  combination of conditions is precisely what we do not see in Nature.  Each species is continually tending to enlarge its abode; migration to  new abodes is the rule with the slow snail, as with the swift bird;  physical changes are continually going on in every given area; and new  varieties among animals consist in an immense number of cases-perhaps in  the majority--not in the growth of new weapons for snatching the food  from the mouth of its congeners--food is only one out of a hundred of  various conditions of existence--but, as Wallace himself shows in a  charming paragraph on the \"divergence of characters\" (Darwinism, p.  107), in forming new"]]]
