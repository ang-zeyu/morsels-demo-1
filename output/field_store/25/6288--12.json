This is the real  explanation of light comedy, which holds the same relation to actual  life as does a jointed dancing-doll to a man walking,--being, as it is,  an artificial exaggeration of a natural rigidity in things. The thread  that binds it to actual life is a very fragile one. It is scarcely more  than a game which, like all games, depends on a previously accepted  convention. Comedy in character strikes far deeper roots into life.  With that kind of comedy we shall deal more particularly in the final  portion of our investigation. But we must first analyse a certain type  of the comic, in many respects similar to that of light comedy: the  comic in words.      II    There may be something artificial in making a special category for the  comic in words, since most of the varieties of the comic that we have  examined so far were produced through the medium of language. We must  make a distinction, however, between the comic EXPRESSED and the comic  CREATED by language. The former could, if necessary, be translated from  one language into another, though at the cost of losing the greater  portion of its significance when introduced into a fresh society  different in manners, in literature, and above all in association of  ideas. But it is generally impossible to translate the latter. It owes  its entire being to the structure of the sentence or to the choice of  the words. It does not set forth, by means of language, special cases  of absentmindedness in man or in events. It lays stress on lapses of  attention in language itself. In this case, it is language itself that  becomes comic.    Comic sayings, however, are not a matter of spontaneous generation; if  we laugh at them, we are equally entitled to laugh at their author.  This latter condition, however, is not indispensable, since the saying  or expression has a comic virtue of its own. This is proved by the fact  that we find it very difficult, in the majority of these cases, to say  whom we are laughing at, although at times we have a dim, vague feeling  that there is some one in the background.    Moreover, the person implicated is not always the speaker. Here it  seems as though we should draw an important distinction between the  WITTY (SPIRITUEL) and the COMIC. A word is said to be comic when it  makes us laugh at the person who utters it, and witty when it makes us  laugh either at a third party or at ourselves. But in most cases we can  hardly make up our minds whether the word is comic or witty. All that  we can say is that it is laughable.    Before proceeding, it might be well to examine more closely what is  meant by ESPRIT. A witty saying makes us at least smile; consequently,  no investigation into laughter would be complete did it not get to the  bottom of the nature of wit and throw light on the underlying idea. It  is to be feared, however, that this extremely subtle essence is one  that evaporates when exposed to the light.    Let us first make a distinction between the two meanings of the word  wit ESPRIT, the broader one and the more restricted. In the broader  meaning of the word, it would seem that what is called wit is a certain  DRAMATIC way of thinking. Instead of treating his ideas as mere  symbols, the wit sees them, he hears them and, above all, makes them  converse with one another like persons. He puts them on the stage, and  himself, to some extent, into the bargain. A witty nation is, of  necessity, a nation enamoured of the theatre. In every wit there is  something of a poet--just as in every good reader there is the making  of an actor. This comparison is made purposely, because a proportion  might easily be established between the four terms. In order to read  well we need only the intellectual side of the actor's art; but in  order to act well one must be an actor in all one's soul and body. In  just the same way, poetic creation calls for some degree of  self-forgetfulness, whilst the wit does not usually err in this  respect. We always get a glimpse of the latter behind what he says and  does. He is not wholly engrossed in the business, because he only  brings his intelligence into play. So any poet may reveal himself as a  wit when he pleases. To do this there will be no need for him to  acquire anything; it seems rather as though he would have to give up  something. He would simply have to let his ideas hold converse with one  another \"for nothing, for the mere joy of the thing!\" [Footnote: \"Pour  rien, pour le plaisir\" is a quotation from Victor Hugo's Marion  Delorme] He would only have to unfasten the double bond which keeps his  ideas in touch with his feelings and his soul in touch with life. In  short, he would turn into a wit by simply resolving to be no longer a  poet in feeling, but only in intelligence.    But if wit consists, for the most part, in seeing things SUB SPECIE  THEATRI, it is evidently capable of being specially directed to one  variety of dramatic art, namely, comedy. Here we have a more restricted  meaning of the term, and, moreover, the only one that interests us from  the point of view of the theory of laughter. What is here called WIT is  a gift for dashing off comic scenes in a few strokes--dashing them off,  however, so subtly, delicately and rapidly, that all is over as soon as  we begin to notice them.    Who are the actors in these scenes? With whom has the wit to deal?  First of all, with his interlocutors themselves, when his witticism is  a direct retort to one of them. Often with an absent person whom he  supposes to have spoken and to whom he is replying. Still oftener, with  the whole world,--in the ordinary meaning of the term,--which he takes  to task, twisting a current idea into a paradox, or making use of a  hackneyed phrase, or parodying some quotation or proverb. If we compare  these scenes in miniature with one another, we find they are almost  always variations of a comic theme with which we are well acquainted,  that of the \"robber robbed.\" You take up a metaphor, a phrase, an  argument, and turn it against the man who is, or might be, its author,  so that he is made to say what he did not mean to say and lets himself  be caught, to some extent, in the toils of language. But the theme of  the \"robber robbed\" is not the only possible one. We have gone over  many varieties of the comic, and there is not one of them that is  incapable of being volatilised into a witticism.    Every witty remark, then, lends itself to an analysis, whose chemical  formula, so to say, we are now in a position to state. It runs as  follows: Take the remark, first enlarge it into a regular scene, then  find out the category of the comic to which the scene evidently  belongs: by this means you reduce the witty remark to its simplest  elements and obtain a full explanation of it.    Let us apply this method to a classic example. \"Your chest hurts me\"  (J'AI MAL A VOTRE POITRINE) wrote Mme. de Sevigne to her ailing  daughter--clearly a witty saying. If our theory is correct, we need  only lay stress upon the saying, enlarge and magnify it, and we shall  see it expand into a comic scene. Now, we find this very scene, ready  made, in the AMOUR MEDECIN of Moliere. The sham doctor, Clitandre, who  has been summoned to attend Sganarelle's daughter, contents himself  with feeling Sganarelle's own pulse, whereupon, relying on the sympathy  there must be between father and daughter, he unhesitatingly concludes:  \"Your daughter is very ill!\" Here we have the transition from the witty  to the comical. To complete our analysis, then, all we have to do is to  discover what there is comical in the idea of giving a diagnosis of the  child after sounding the father or the mother. Well, we know that one  essential form of comic fancy lies in picturing to ourselves a living  person as a kind of jointed dancing-doll, and that frequently, with the  object of inducing us to form this mental picture, we are shown two or  more persons speaking and acting as though attached to one another by  invisible strings. Is not this the idea here suggested when we are led  to materialise, so to speak, the sympathy we postulate as existing  between father and daughter?    We now see how it is that writers on wit have perforce confined  themselves to commenting on the extraordinary complexity of the things  denoted by the term without ever succeeding in defining it. There are  many ways of being witty, almost as many as there are of being the  reverse. How can we detect what they have in common with one another,  unless we first determine the general relationship between the witty  and the comic? Once, however, this relationship is cleared up,  everything is plain sailing. We then find the same connection between  the comic and the witty as exists between a regular scene and the  fugitive suggestion of a possible one. Hence, however numerous the  forms assumed by the comic, wit will possess an equal number of  corresponding varieties. So that the comic, in all its forms, is what  should be defined first, by discovering (a task which is already quite  difficult enough) the clue that leads from one form to the other. By  that very operation wit will have been analysed, and will then appear  as nothing more than the comic in a highly volatile state. To follow  the opposite plan, however, and attempt directly to evolve a formula  for wit, would be courting certain failure. What should we think of a  chemist who, having ever so many jars of a certain substance in his  laboratory, would prefer getting that substance from the atmosphere, in  which merely infinitesimal traces of its vapour are to be found?    But this comparison between the witty and the comic is also indicative  of the line we must take in studying the comic in words. On the one  hand, indeed, we find there is no essential difference between a word  that is comic and one that is witty; on the other hand, the latter,  although connected with a figure of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#13)"],[1,"the rope from the old man, who, when he was  free, at once shouldered his scythe, rearranged his white robe and  nodded farewell.    The next moment he had disappeared, and with a rustle and rumble and  roar of activity the world came to life again and jogged along as it  always had before.    Jim wound up his lasso, mounted the butcher's horse and rode slowly  down the street.    Loud screams came from the corner, where a great crowd of people  quickly assembled. From his seat on the horse Jim saw Miss Scrapple,  attired in the policeman's uniform, angrily shaking her fists in  Mulligan's face, while the officer was furiously stamping upon the  lady's hat, which he had torn from his own head amidst the jeers of  the crowd.    As he rode past the schoolhouse he heard a tremendous chorus of  yells, and knew Prof. Sharpe was having a hard time to quell the  riot caused by the sign on the blackboard.    Through the window of the barber shop he saw the \"mean man\"  frantically belaboring the barber with a hair brush, while his hair  stood up stiff as bayonets in all directions. And the grocer ran out  of his door and yelled \"Fire!\" while his shoes left a track of  molasses wherever he stepped.    Jim's heart was filled with joy. He was fairly reveling in the  excitement he had caused when some one caught his leg and pulled him  from the horse.    \"What're ye doin' hear, ye rascal?\" cried the butcher, angrily;  \"didn't ye promise to put that beast inter Plympton's pasture? An'  now I find ye ridin' the poor nag around like a gentleman o'  leisure!\"    \"That's a fact,\" said Jim, with surprise; \"I clean forgot about the  horse!\"    * * * * *    This story should teach us the supreme importance of Time and the  folly of trying to stop it. For should you succeed, as Jim did, in  bringing Time to a standstill, the world would soon become a dreary  place and life decidedly unpleasant.          THE WONDERFUL PUMP      Not many years ago there lived on a stony, barren New England farm a  man and his wife. They were sober, honest people, working hard from  early morning until dark to enable them to secure a scanty living  from their poor land.    Their house, a small, one-storied building, stood upon the side of a  steep hill, and the stones lay so thickly about it that scarce  anything green could grow from the ground. At the foot of the hill,  a quarter of a mile from the house by the winding path, was a small  brook, and the woman was obliged to go there for water and to carry  it up the hill to the house. This was a tedious task, and with the  other hard work that fell to her share had made her gaunt and bent  and lean.    Yet she never complained, but meekly and faithfully performed her  duties, doing the housework, carrying the water and helping her  husband hoe the scanty crop that grew upon the best part of their  land.    One day, as she walked down the path to the brook, her big shoes  scattering the pebbles right and left, she noticed a large beetle  lying upon its back and struggling hard with its little legs to turn  over, that its feet might again touch the ground. But this it could  not accomplish; so the woman, who had a kind heart, reached down and  gently turned the beetle with her finger. At once it scampered from  the path and she went on to the brook.    The next day, as she came for water, she was surprised to see the  beetle again lying upon its back and struggling helplessly to turn.  Once more the woman stopped and set him upon his feet; and then, as  she stooped over the tiny creature, she heard a small voice say:    \"Oh, thank you! Thank you so much for saving me!\"    Half frightened at hearing a beetle speak in her own language, the  woman started back and exclaimed:    \"La sakes! Surely you can't talk like humans!\" Then, recovering from  her alarm, she again bent over the beetle, who answered her:    \"Why shouldn't I talk, if I have anything to say?    \"'Cause you're a bug,\" replied the woman.    \"That is true; and you saved my life--saved me from my enemies, the  sparrows. And this is the second time you have come to my  assistance, so I owe you a debt of gratitude. Bugs value their lives  as much as human beings, and I am a more important creature than  you, in your ignorance, may suppose. But, tell me, why do you come  each day to the brook?\"    \"For water,\" she answered, staring stupidly down at the talking  beetle.    \"Isn't it hard work?\" the creature inquired.    \"Yes; but there's no water on the hill,\" said she.    \"Then dig a well and put a pump in it,\" replied the beetle.    She shook her head.    \"My man tried it once; but there was no water,\" she said, sadly.    \"Try it again,\" commanded the beetle; \"and in return for your  kindness to me I will make this promise: if you do not get water  from the well you will get that which is more precious to you. I  must go now. Do not forget. Dig a well.\"    And then, without pausing to say good-by, it ran swiftly away and  was lost among the stones.    The woman returned to the house much perplexed by what the beetle  had said, and when her husband came in from his work she told him  the whole story.    The poor man thought deeply for a time, and then declared:    \"Wife, there may be truth in what the bug told you. There must be  magic in the world yet, if a beetle can speak; and if there is such  a thing as magic we may get water from the well. The pump I bought  to use in the well which proved to be dry is now lying in the barn,  and the only expense in following the talking bug's advice will be  the labor of digging the hole. Labor I am used to; so I will dig the  well.\"    Next day he set about it, and dug so far down in the ground that he  could hardly reach the top to climb out again; but not a drop of  water was found.    \"Perhaps you did not dig deep enough,\" his wife said, when he told  her of his failure.    So the following day he made a long ladder, which he put into the  hole; and then he dug, and dug, and dug, until the top of the ladder  barely reached the top of the hole. But still there was no water.    When the woman next went to the brook with her pail she saw the  beetle sitting upon a stone beside her path. So she stopped and  said:    \"My husband has dug the well; but there is no water.\"    \"Did he put the pump in the well?\" asked the beetle.    \"No,\" she answered.    \"Then do as I commanded; put in the pump, and if you do not get  water I promise you something still more precious.\"    Saying which, the beetle swiftly slid from the stone and  disappeared. The woman went back to the house and told her husband  what the bug had said.    \"Well,\" replied the simple fellow, \"there can be no harm in trying.\"    So he got the pump from the barn and placed it in the well, and then  he took hold of the handle and began to pump, while his wife stood  by to watch what would happen.    No water came, but after a few moments a gold piece dropped from the  spout of the pump, and then another, and another, until several  handfuls of gold lay in a little heap upon the ground.    The man stopped pumping then and ran to help his wife gather the  gold pieces into her apron; but their hands trembled so greatly  through excitement and joy that they could scarcely pick up the  sparkling coins.    At last she gathered them close to her bosom and together they ran  to the house, where they emptied the precious gold upon the table  and counted the pieces.    All were stamped with the design of the United States mint and were  worth five dollars each. Some were worn and somewhat discolored from  use, while others seemed bright and new, as if they had not been  much handled. When the value of the pieces was added together they  were found to be worth three hundred dollars.    Suddenly the woman spoke.    \"Husband, the beetle said truly when he declared we should get  something more precious than water from the well. But run at once  and take away the handle from the pump, lest anyone should pass this  way and discover our secret.\"    So the man ran to the pump and removed the handle, which he carried  to the house and hid underneath the bed.    They hardly slept a wink that night, lying awake to think of their  good fortune and what they should do with their store of yellow  gold. In all their former lives they had never possessed more than a  few dollars at a time, and now the cracked teapot was nearly full of  gold coins.    The following day was Sunday, and they arose early and ran to see if  their treasure was safe. There it lay, heaped snugly within the  teapot, and they were so willing to feast their eyes upon it that it  was long before the man could leave it to build the fire or the  woman to cook the breakfast.    While they ate their simple meal the woman said:    \"We will go to church to-day and return thanks for the riches that  have come to us so suddenly. And I will give the pastor one of the  gold pieces.\"    \"It is well enough to go to church,\" replied her husband, \"and also  to return thanks. But in the night I decided how we will spend all  our money; so there will be none left for the pastor.\"    \"We can pump more,\" said the woman.    \"Perhaps; and perhaps not,\" he answered, cautiously. \"What we have  we can depend upon, but whether or not there be more in the well I  cannot say.\"    \"Then go and find out,\" she returned, \"for I am anxious to give  something to the pastor, who is a poor man and deserving.\"    So the man got the pump handle from beneath the bed, and, going to  the pump, fitted it in place. Then he set a large wooden bucket  under the spout and began to pump. To their joy the gold pieces soon  began flowing into the pail, and, seeing it about to run over the  brim, the woman brought another pail. But now the stream suddenly  stopped, and the man said, cheerfully:    \"That is enough for to-day, good wife! We have added greatly to our  treasure, and the parson shall have his gold piece.
