He had at the same time taken up  little Morning, and carried her to his wife, to conceal her in the  lodging he had at the bottom of the courtyard.    About eight days afterward the wicked Queen said to the clerk of the  kitchen, \"I will sup on little Day.\"    He answered not a word, being resolved to cheat her as he had done  before. He went to find out little Day, and saw him with a little foil  in his hand, with which he was fencing with a great monkey, the child  being then only three years of age. He took him up in his arms and  carried him to his wife, that she might conceal him in her chamber along  with his sister, and in the room of little Day cooked up a young kid,  very tender, which the Ogress found to be wonderfully good.    This was hitherto all mighty well; but one evening this wicked Queen  said to her clerk of the kitchen:    \"I will eat the Queen with the same sauce I had with her children.\"    It was now that the poor clerk of the kitchen despaired of being able  to deceive her. The young Queen was turned of twenty, not reckoning the  hundred years she had been asleep; and how to find in the yard a beast  so firm was what puzzled him. He took then a resolution, that he might  save his own life, to cut the Queen's throat; and going up into her  chamber, with intent to do it at once, he put himself into as great  fury as he could possibly, and came into the young Queen's room with his  dagger in his hand. He would not, however, surprise her, but told  her, with a great deal of respect, the orders he had received from the  Queen-mother.    \"Do it; do it\" (said she, stretching out her neck). \"Execute your  orders, and then I shall go and see my children, my poor children, whom  I so much and so tenderly loved.\"    For she thought them dead ever since they had been taken away without  her knowledge.    \"No, no, madam\" (cried the poor clerk of the kitchen, all in tears);  \"you shall not die, and yet you shall see your children again; but then  you must go home with me to my lodgings, where I have concealed them,  and I shall deceive the Queen once more, by giving her in your stead a  young hind.\"    Upon this he forthwith conducted her to his chamber, where, leaving her  to embrace her children, and cry along with them, he went and dressed a  young hind, which the Queen had for her supper, and devoured it with  the same appetite as if it had been the young Queen. Exceedingly was  she delighted with her cruelty, and she had invented a story to tell the  King, at his return, how the mad wolves had eaten up the Queen his wife  and her two children.    One evening, as she was, according to her custom, rambling round about  the courts and yards of the palace to see if she could smell any fresh  meat, she heard, in a ground room, little Day crying, for his mamma was  going to whip him, because he had been naughty; and she heard, at the  same time, little Morning begging pardon for her brother.    The Ogress presently knew the voice of the Queen and her children, and  being quite mad that she had been thus deceived, she commanded next  morning, by break of day (with a most horrible voice, which made  everybody tremble), that they should bring into the middle of the great  court a large tub, which she caused to be filled with toads, vipers,  snakes, and all sorts of serpents, in order to have thrown into it the  Queen and her children, the clerk of the kitchen, his wife and maid;  all whom she had given orders should be brought thither with their hands  tied behind them.    They were brought out accordingly, and the executioners were just going  to throw them into the tub, when the King (who was not so soon expected)  entered the court on horseback (for he came post) and asked, with the  utmost astonishment, what was the meaning of that horrible spectacle.    No one dared to tell him, when the Ogress, all enraged to see what had  happened, threw herself head foremost into the tub, and was instantly  devoured by the ugly creatures she had ordered to be thrown into it for  others. The King could not but be very sorry, for she was his mother;  but he soon comforted himself with his beautiful wife and his pretty  children.          CINDERELLA, OR THE LITTLE GLASS SLIPPER      Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the  proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former  husband, two daughters of her own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like  her in all things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter,  but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took  from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.    No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the mother-in-law  began to show herself in her true colors. She could not bear the good  qualities of this pretty girl, and the less because they made her own  daughters appear the more odious. She employed her in the meanest work  of the house: she scoured the dishes, tables, etc., and scrubbed madam's  chamber, and those of misses, her daughters; she lay up in a sorry  garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay in fine rooms,  with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where  they had looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves at  their full length from head to foot.    The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who  would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him entirely. When she  had done her work, she used to go into the chimney-corner, and sit down  among cinders and ashes, which made her commonly be called Cinderwench;  but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called  her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel,  was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters, though they were always  dressed very richly.    It happened that the King's son gave a ball, and invited all persons of  fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a very  grand figure among the quality. They were mightily delighted at this  invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats,  and head-clothes as might become them. This was a new trouble to  Cinderella; for it was she who ironed her sisters' linen, and plaited  their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but how they should  be dressed.    \"For my part,\" said the eldest, \"I will wear my red velvet suit with  French trimming.\"    \"And I,\" said the youngest, \"shall have my usual petticoat; but then,  to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my  diamond stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the  world.\"    They sent for the best tire-woman they could get to make up their  head-dresses and adjust their double pinners, and they had their red  brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de la Poche.    Cinderella was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these  matters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them always for the  best, nay, and offered her services to dress their heads, which they  were very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said to  her:    \"Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?\"    \"Alas!\" said she, \"you only jeer me; it is not for such as I am to go  thither.\"    \"Thou art in the right of it,\" replied they; \"it would make the people  laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.\"    Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads awry, but she was  very good, and dressed them perfectly well They were almost two days  without eating, so much were they transported with joy. They broke above  a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a  fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass.  At last the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderella followed  them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of  them, she fell a-crying.    Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.    \"I wish I could--I wish I could--\"; she was not able to speak the rest,  being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.    This godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, \"Thou wishest thou  couldst go to the ball; is it not so?\"    \"Y--es,\" cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.    \"Well,\" said her godmother, \"be but a good girl, and I will contrive  that thou shalt go.\" Then she took her into her chamber, and said to  her, \"Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.\"    Cinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and  brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin  could make her go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside  of it, having left nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with  her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded  all over with gold.    She then went to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all  alive, and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor, when,  giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, the mouse  was that moment turned into a fine horse, which altogether made a very  fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored dapple-gray. Being  at a loss for a coachman,    \"I will go and see,\" says Cinderella, \"if there is never a rat in the  rat-trap--we may make a coachman of him.\"    \"Thou art in the right,\" replied her godmother; \"go and look.\"    Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge  rats. The fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest  beard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat,  jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld. After  that, she said to her:    \"Go again into the garden, and you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50302"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of Nauvoo (#13)"],[1,"fall. While Joseph extended a hearty  welcome to the doctor to come to Nauvoo, he by no means held out very  flattering inducements to him, as may be seen by Joseph's letters to  him in answer to those of Bennett's, expressing his determination to  join the Saints at Commerce. He said:        I have no doubt that you would be of great service to this      community in practicing your profession, as well as those other      abilities of which you are in possession. Though to devote      your time and abilities in the cause of truth and a suffering      people, may not be the means of exalting you in the eyes of this      generation, or securing you the riches of this world, yet by so      doing you may rely on the approval of Jehovah, \"that blessing which      maketh rich and addeth no sorrow.\" * * * Therefore, my general      invitation is, let all who will come, come and partake of the      poverty of Nauvoo, freely.        I should be disposed to give you a special invitation to come as      early as possible, believing you will be of great service to us.      However, you must make your own arrangements according to your      circumstances. Were it possible for you to come here this season      to suffer affliction with the people of God, no one will be more      pleased to give you a cordial welcome than myself.    Surely this was frank enough, and ought to have dispelled from the  doctor's mind, if at that time such ideas lurked there, all thoughts  of winning worldly fame, or gratifying vain ambition, by linking his  fortunes with those of The Church of Jesus Christ.        CHAPTER XIII.    RENEWAL OF HOSTILITIES BY MISSOURI.    IT would appear that Hatred's hunger is never fed; it seems to possess  an appetite which is insatiable, and can never feel at ease so long  as the object of its detestation remains within its reach; and even  when that object is removed beyond the immediate power of Hatred to do  it harm, as the dragon of the apocalypse when he could not follow the  woman he had persecuted into the wilderness, cast out of his mouth a  flood of water after her to destroy her--even so Hatred, when baffled  in his efforts to destroy his victims, sends out floods of falsehood to  overwhelm them by infusing his own venom into the breasts of others;  that that destruction which he could not bring to pass himself, might  be brought about by another.    Such was the course of hate-blinded Missouri towards the Saints of  God, whom she had driven beyond her borders. Seeing that she had not  destroyed them, but that they were now upon the eve of enjoying an era  of prosperity such as they had never enjoyed while within her borders,  she employed all her cunning to incite the hatred of the citizens of  Illinois against them. But this was not easy of accomplishment; and at  first, the misrepresentations of a State that had been guilty of such  outrages as those committed by Missouri against the Latter-day Saints,  had but little weight in Illinois.    Finding that their accusations against the people whom they had so  wronged had little or no effect, an effort was made to give coloring  to their statements; and stolen goods were conveyed from Missouri to  the vicinity of Commerce, so that when they were found, suspicion might  rest upon the people in whose neighborhood the stolen articles were  discovered.    Nor did their outrages stop at this. But doubtless being emboldened  by reason of the general government's refusing to make any effort to  redress the wrongs of the Saints, a company of men led by William  Allensworth, H. M. Woodyard, Wm. Martin, J. H. Owsely, John Bain, Light  T. Lait and Halsay White, crossed over the Mississippi to Illinois, at  a point a few miles above Quincy, and kidnapped Alanson Brown, James  Allred, Benjamin Boyce and Noah Rogers; and without any writ or warrant  of any character whatever, they dragged them over to Missouri, to a  neighborhood called Tully, in Lewis County. These unfortunate men were  imprisoned for a day or two in an old log cabin, during which time  their lives were repeatedly threatened. At one time Brown was taken  out, a rope placed around his neck, and he was hung up to a tree until  he was nearly strangled to death. Boyce at the same time was tied to a  tree, stripped of his clothing and inhumanly beaten. Rogers was also  beaten, and Allred was stripped of every particle of clothing, and  tied up to a tree for the greater part of the night, and threatened  frequently by a man named Monday, exclaiming: \"G--d d--n you, I'll cut  you to the hollow.\" He was finally, however, released without being  whipped.    After they had received this inhuman treatment, their captors performed  an act purely Missourian in its character, that is, they gave them the  following note of acquittal:                                             TULLY, MISSOURI, July 12, 1840.        The people of Tully, having taken up Mr. Allred, with some others,      and having examined into the offenses committed, find nothing to      justify his detention any longer, and have released him.        By order of the committee.                                                       H. M. WOODYARD.    As soon as the people of Commerce and vicinity were informed of this  outrage, Gentiles as well as Mormons were loud in their condemnation  of it, and at once a mass meeting was called, and resolutions were  adopted, expressing their unqualified indignation, and calling upon  the governor of Illinois to take the necessary steps to punish those  who had committed this outrage, and by vindicating the law, give the  Missourians to understand there was a limit beyond which their deeds of  violence must not pass.    D.H. Wells, not then a member of The Church, and George Miller were  appointed a committee to wait upon Governor Carlin, and lay the case  before him. For this purpose they repaired to Quincy, and at the  recital of the cruelties practiced upon the men who were the victims of  the Missourians, the governor's wife, who was present at the interview,  was moved to tears, and the governor himself was greatly agitated. He  promised to counsel with the State attorney, who by law was made his  adviser, and promised to take such steps as the case seemed to require,  and the law to justify. Just what was done by Governor Carlin, however,  I am unable to learn; but one thing is certain, and that is, the guilty  parties were never brought to justice, nor even to a trial--indeed it  may be that even then the love which Governor Carlin once had for the  Saints, and which at last became dead, had begun to grow cold.    Scarcely had the excitement occasioned by the kidnapping of Allred  and his associates subsided, when Governor Boggs of Missouri made a  requisition on Governor Carlin, of Illinois, for the persons of Joseph  Smith, Jr., Sidney Rigdon, Lyman Wight, P.P. Pratt, Caleb Baldwin and  Alanson Brown, as fugitives from justice. Governor Carlin granted the  requisition--was it another case of Herod and Pilate being made friends  over the surrender of God's Prophet? But fortunately when the sheriff  went to Commerce with his requisition, Joseph and his brethren were  not at home, and could not be found; so that the officers returned  without them. These men were not fugitives from justice, no process  had ever been found against them, the governor himself had connived at  their escape from the hands of the officers charged with the duty of  conducting them from Liberty, Clay County, to Boone County; [1] and  these men did not feel disposed to try again \"the solemn realities of  mob law in Missouri.\"    These circumstances gave the Saints to understand that their peace  in their beautiful situation on the banks of the placid, grand,  old Mississippi was not to be without alloy; the goal of their  final triumph and rest had not been reached. These incidents were a  premonition of danger; they were indeed the few drops of rain which  sometimes precede the storm, but a kind Providence shut out from their  vision how fierce that storm would be, or how would they have had the  courage to meet it?    Footnotes    1. Missouri Persecutions, Chapter XLVII.        CHAPTER XIV.    FOUNDING A CITY.    MEANTIME Commerce had become Nauvoo. The city of Nauvoo was  incorporated by act of the legislature of Illinois, on the fourteenth  of December, 1840. The charter granted on that date described the  boundaries of the city, but gave to the citizens--whom it erected a  body corporate and politic--the right to extend the area of the city  whenever any tract of land adjoining should have been laid out into  town lots and recorded according to law. The city council was to  consist of a mayor, four aldermen and nine councilors to be elected  by the qualified voters of the city. The first Monday in February was  appointed for the first election of officers.    The charter granted to the citizens of Nauvoo the most plenary powers  in the management of their local affairs. Indeed, about the only limit  placed upon their powers was, that they do nothing inconsistent with  the constitution of the United States, and the State constitution of  Illinois. But inside of those lines they were all powerful to make  and execute such ordinances as in the wisdom of the city council were  necessary for the peace, good order, and general welfare of the city.  It afterwards became a question in the State as to whether or not  powers too great had not been granted the city government--but of that  I shall have occasion to speak further on.    The leading men of the State appeared not only willing but anxious  to grant the privileges of this city government to the Saints. S. H.  Little, of the upper house of the State legislature, especially stood  by the Saints, and pleaded for their rights; together with Messrs.  Snyder, Ralston, Moore, Ross and Stapp; while Mr. John F.
