Yes, I've had some adventures in my time; and, do  you know, Mistress Blythe, I still lust after 'em.  Yes, old and  useless as I be, there's an awful longing sweeps over me at times to  sail out--out--out there--forever and ever.\"    \"Like Ulysses, you would        'Sail beyond the sunset and the baths       Of all the western stars until you die,'\"    said Anne dreamily.    \"Ulysses?  I've read of him.  Yes, that's just how I feel--jest how all  us old sailors feel, I reckon.  I'll die on land after all, I s'pose.  Well, what is to be will be.  There was old William Ford at the Glen  who never went on the water in his life, 'cause he was afraid of being  drowned.  A fortune-teller had predicted he would be.  And one day he  fainted and fell with his face in the barn trough and was drowned.  Must you go?  Well, come soon and come often.  The doctor is to do the  talking next time.  He knows a heap of things I want to find out.  I'm  sorter lonesome here by times.  It's been worse since Elizabeth Russell  died.  Her and me was such cronies.\"    Captain Jim spoke with the pathos of the aged, who see their old  friends slipping from them one by one--friends whose place can never be  quite filled by those of a younger generation, even of the race that  knows Joseph.  Anne and Gilbert promised to come soon and often.    \"He's a rare old fellow, isn't he?\" said Gilbert, as they walked home.    \"Somehow, I can't reconcile his simple, kindly personality with the  wild, adventurous life he has lived,\" mused Anne.    \"You wouldn't find it so hard if you had seen him the other day down at  the fishing village.  One of the men of Peter Gautier's boat made a  nasty remark about some girl along the shore.  Captain Jim fairly  scorched the wretched fellow with the lightning of his eyes.  He seemed  a man transformed.  He didn't say much--but the way he said it!  You'd  have thought it would strip the flesh from the fellow's bones.  I  understand that Captain Jim will never allow a word against any woman  to be said in his presence.\"    \"I wonder why he never married,\" said Anne.  \"He should have sons with  their ships at sea now, and grandchildren climbing over him to hear his  stories--he's that kind of a man.  Instead, he has nothing but a  magnificent cat.\"    But Anne was mistaken.  Captain Jim had more than that.  He had a  memory.        CHAPTER 10    LESLIE MOORE    \"I'm going for a walk to the outside shore tonight,\" Anne told Gog and  Magog one October evening.  There was no one else to tell, for Gilbert  had gone over the harbor.  Anne had her little domain in the speckless  order one would expect of anyone brought up by Marilla Cuthbert, and  felt that she could gad shoreward with a clear conscience.  Many and  delightful had been her shore rambles, sometimes with Gilbert,  sometimes with Captain Jim, sometimes alone with her own thoughts and  new, poignantly-sweet dreams that were beginning to span life with  their rainbows.  She loved the gentle, misty harbor shore and the  silvery, wind-haunted sand shore, but best of all she loved the rock  shore, with its cliffs and caves and piles of surf-worn boulders, and  its coves where the pebbles glittered under the pools; and it was to  this shore she hied herself tonight.    There had been an autumn storm of wind and rain, lasting for three  days.  Thunderous had been the crash of billows on the rocks, wild the  white spray and spume that blew over the bar, troubled and misty and  tempest-torn the erstwhile blue peace of Four Winds Harbor.  Now it was  over, and the shore lay clean-washed after the storm; not a wind  stirred, but there was still a fine surf on, dashing on sand and rock  in a splendid white turmoil--the only restless thing in the great,  pervading stillness and peace.    \"Oh, this is a moment worth living through weeks of storm and stress  for,\" Anne exclaimed, delightedly sending her far gaze across the  tossing waters from the top of the cliff where she stood.  Presently  she scrambled down the steep path to the little cove below, where she  seemed shut in with rocks and sea and sky.    \"I'm going to dance and sing,\" she said.  \"There's no one here to see  me--the seagulls won't carry tales of the matter.  I may be as crazy as  I like.\"    She caught up her skirt and pirouetted along the hard strip of sand  just out of reach of the waves that almost lapped her feet with their  spent foam.  Whirling round and round, laughing like a child, she  reached the little headland that ran out to the east of the cove; then  she stopped suddenly, blushing crimson; she was not alone; there had  been a witness to her dance and laughter.    The girl of the golden hair and sea-blue eyes was sitting on a boulder  of the headland, half-hidden by a jutting rock.  She was looking  straight at Anne with a strange expression--part wonder, part sympathy,  part--could it be?--envy.  She was bare-headed, and her splendid hair,  more than ever like Browning's \"gorgeous snake,\" was bound about her  head with a crimson ribbon.  She wore a dress of some dark material,  very plainly made; but swathed about her waist, outlining its fine  curves, was a vivid girdle of red silk.  Her hands, clasped over her  knee, were brown and somewhat work-hardened; but the skin of her throat  and cheeks was as white as cream.  A flying gleam of sunset broke  through a low-lying western cloud and fell across her hair.  For a  moment she seemed the spirit of the sea personified--all its mystery,  all its passion, all its elusive charm.    \"You--you must think me crazy,\" stammered Anne, trying to recover her  self-possession.  To be seen by this stately girl in such an abandon of  childishness--she, Mrs. Dr. Blythe, with all the dignity of the matron  to keep up--it was too bad!    \"No,\" said the girl, \"I don't.\"    She said nothing more; her voice was expressionless; her manner  slightly repellent; but there was something in her eyes--eager yet shy,  defiant yet pleading--which turned Anne from her purpose of walking  away.  Instead, she sat down on the boulder beside the girl.    \"Let's introduce ourselves,\" she said, with the smile that had never  yet failed to win confidence and friendliness.  \"I am Mrs. Blythe--and  I live in that little white house up the harbor shore.\"    \"Yes, I know,\" said the girl.  \"I am Leslie Moore--Mrs. Dick Moore,\"  she added stiffly.    Anne was silent for a moment from sheer amazement.  It had not occurred  to her that this girl was married--there seemed nothing of the wife  about her.  And that she should be the neighbor whom Anne had pictured  as a commonplace Four Winds housewife!  Anne could not quickly adjust  her mental focus to this astonishing change.    \"Then--then you live in that gray house up the brook,\" she stammered.    \"Yes.  I should have gone over to call on you long ago,\" said the  other.  She did not offer any explanation or excuse for not having gone.    \"I wish you WOULD come,\" said Anne, recovering herself somewhat.  \"We're such near neighbors we ought to be friends.  That is the sole  fault of Four Winds--there aren't quite enough neighbors.  Otherwise it  is perfection.\"    \"You like it?\"    \"LIKE it!  I love it.  It is the most beautiful place I ever saw.\"    \"I've never seen many places,\" said Leslie Moore, slowly, \"but I've  always thought it was very lovely here.  I--I love it, too.\"    She spoke, as she looked, shyly, yet eagerly.  Anne had an odd  impression that this strange girl--the word \"girl\" would persist--could  say a good deal if she chose.    \"I often come to the shore,\" she added.    \"So do I,\" said Anne.  \"It's a wonder we haven't met here before.\"    \"Probably you come earlier in the evening than I do.  It is generally  late--almost dark--when I come.  And I love to come just after a  storm--like this.  I don't like the sea so well when it's calm and  quiet.  I like the struggle--and the crash--and the noise.\"    \"I love it in all its moods,\" declared Anne.  \"The sea at Four Winds is  to me what Lover's Lane was at home.  Tonight it seemed so free--so  untamed--something broke loose in me, too, out of sympathy.  That was  why I danced along the shore in that wild way.  I didn't suppose  anybody was looking, of course.  If Miss Cornelia Bryant had seen me  she would have forboded a gloomy prospect for poor young Dr. Blythe.\"    \"You know Miss Cornelia?\" said Leslie, laughing.  She had an exquisite  laugh; it bubbled up suddenly and unexpectedly with something of the  delicious quality of a baby's.  Anne laughed, too.    \"Oh, yes.  She has been down to my house of dreams several times.\"    \"Your house of dreams?\"    \"Oh, that's a dear, foolish little name Gilbert and I have for our  home.  We just call it that between ourselves.  It slipped out before I  thought.\"    \"So Miss Russell's little white house is YOUR house of dreams,\" said  Leslie wonderingly.  \"_I_ had a house of dreams once--but it was a  palace,\" she added, with a laugh, the sweetness of which was marred by  a little note of derision.    \"Oh, I once dreamed of a palace, too,\" said Anne.  \"I suppose all girls  do.  And then we settle down contentedly in eight-room houses that seem  to fulfill all the desires of our hearts--because our prince is there.  YOU should have had your palace really, though--you are so beautiful.  You MUST let me say it--it has to be said--I'm nearly bursting with  admiration.  You are the loveliest thing I ever saw, Mrs. Moore.\"    \"If we are to be friends you must call me Leslie,\" said the other with  an odd passion.    \"Of course I will.  And MY friends call me Anne.\"    \"I suppose I am beautiful,\" Leslie went on, looking stormily out to  sea.  \"I hate my beauty.  I wish I had always been as brown and plain  as the brownest and plainest girl at the fishing village over there.  Well, what do you think of Miss Cornelia?\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5449"],[0,"Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Complete (#13)"],[1,"spot.    These glances had hitherto been unobserved by him to whom they were  directed.    Leaning against the wall on the right hand side of the room, dressed in  his long, snow-white priest's robe, Pentaur stood awaiting the princess.  His head-dress touched the ceiling, and the narrow streak of light,  which fell through the opening in the roof, streamed on his handsome  head and his breast, while all around him was veiled in twilight gloom.    Once more the suffering girl looked up, and her glance this time met  the eye of the young priest, who immediately raised his hand, and  half-mechanically, in a low voice, uttered the words of blessing; and  then once more fixed his gaze on the dingy floor, and pursued his own  reflections.    Some hours since he had come hither, obedient to the orders of Ameni,  to impress on the princess that she had defiled herself by touching  a paraschites, and could only be cleansed again by the hand of the  priests.    He had crossed the threshold of the paraschites most reluctantly, and  the thought that he, of all men, had been selected to censure a deed  of the noblest humanity, and to bring her who had done it to judgment,  weighed upon him as a calamity.    In his intercourse with his friend Nebsecht, Pentaur had thrown off many  fetters, and given place to many thoughts that his master would have  held sinful and presumptuous; but at the same time he acknowledged the  sanctity of the old institutions, which were upheld by those whom he had  learned to regard as the divinely-appointed guardians of the spiritual  possessions of God's people; nor was he wholly free from the pride of  caste and the haughtiness which, with prudent intent, were inculcated in  the priests. He held the common man, who put forth his strength to win a  maintenance for his belongings by honest bodily labor--the merchant--the  artizan--the peasant, nay even the warrior, as far beneath the godly  brotherhood who strove for only spiritual ends; and most of all he  scorned the idler, given up to sensual enjoyments.    He held him unclean who had been branded by the law; and how should  it have been otherwise? These people, who at the embalming of the dead  opened the body of the deceased, had become despised for their office of  mutilating the sacred temple of the soul; but no paraschites chose his  calling of his own free will.--[Diodorus I, 91]--It was handed down from  father to son, and he who was born a paraschites--so he was taught--had  to expiate an old guilt with which his soul had long ago burdened itself  in a former existence, within another body, and which had deprived it  of absolution in the nether world. It had passed through various animal  forms, and now began a new human course in the body of a paraschites,  once more to stand after death in the presence of the judges of the  under-world.    Pentaur had crossed the threshold of the man he despised with aversion;  the man himself, sitting at the feet of the suffering girl, had  exclaimed as he saw the priest approaching the hovel:    \"Yet another white robe! Does misfortune cleanse the unclean?\"    Pentaur had not answered the old man, who on his part took no further  notice of him, while he rubbed the girl's feet by order of the leech;  and his hands impelled by tender anxiety untiringly continued the same  movement, as the water-wheel in the Nile keeps up without intermission  its steady motion in the stream.    \"Does misfortune cleanse the unclean?\" Pentaur asked himself. \"Does it  indeed possess a purifying efficacy, and is it possible that the Gods,  who gave to fire the power of refining metals and to the winds power to  sweep the clouds from the sky, should desire that a man--made in their  own image--that a man should be tainted from his birth to his death with  an indelible stain?\"    He looked at the face of the paraschites, and it seemed to him to  resemble that of his father.    This startled him!    And when he noticed how the woman, in whose lap the girl's head  was resting, bent over the injured bosom of the child to catch her  breathing, which she feared had come to a stand-still--with the anguish  of a dove that is struck down by a hawk--he remembered a moment in his  own childhood, when he had lain trembling with fever on his little bed.  What then had happened to him, or had gone on around him, he had long  forgotten, but one image was deeply imprinted on his soul, that of the  face of his mother bending over him in deadly anguish, but who had gazed  on her sick boy not more tenderly, or more anxiously, than this despised  woman on her suffering child.    \"There is only one utterly unselfish, utterly pure and utterly divine  love,\" said he to himself, \"and that is the love of Isis for Horus--the  love of a mother for her child. If these people were indeed so foul as  to defile every thing they touch, how would this pure, this tender, holy  impulse show itself even in them in all its beauty and perfection?\"    \"Still,\" he continued, \"the Celestials have implanted maternal love in  the breast of the lioness, of the typhonic river-horse of the Nile.\"    He looked compassionately at the wife of the paraschites.    He saw her dark face as she turned it away from the sick girl. She had  felt her breathe, and a smile of happiness lighted up her old features;  she nodded first to the surgeon, and then with a deep sigh of relief to  her husband, who, while he did not cease the movement of his left hand,  held up his right hand in prayer to heaven, and his wife did the same.    It seemed to Pentaur that he could see the souls of these two, floating  above the youthful creature in holy union as they joined their hands;  and again he thought of his parents' house, of the hour when his sweet,  only sister died. His mother had thrown herself weeping on the pale  form, but his father had stamped his foot and had thrown back his head,  sobbing and striking his forehead with his fist.    \"How piously submissive and thankful are these unclean ones!\" thought  Pentaur; and repugnance for the old laws began to take root in his  heart. \"Maternal love may exist in the hyaena, but to seek and find  God pertains only to man, who has a noble aim. Up to the limits of  eternity--and God is eternal!--thought is denied to animals; they cannot  even smile. Even men cannot smile at first, for only physical  life--an animal soul--dwells in them; but soon a share of the world's  soul--beaming intelligence--works within them, and first shows itself in  the smile of a child, which is as pure as the light and the truth from  which it comes. The child of the paraschites smiles like any other  creature born of woman, but how few aged men there are, even among the  initiated, who can smile as innocently and brightly as this woman who  has grown grey under open ill-treatment.\"    Deep sympathy began to fill his heart, and he knelt down by the side of  the poor child, raised her arm, and prayed fervently to that One who  had created the heavens and who rules the world--to that One, whom the  mysteries of faith forbade him to name; and not to the innumerable gods,  whom the people worshipped, and who to him were nothing but incarnations  of the attributes of the One and only God of the initiated--of whom he  was one--who was thus brought down to the comprehension of the laity.    He raised his soul to God in passionate emotion; but he prayed, not  for the child before him and for her recovery, but rather for the  whole despised race, and for its release from the old ban, for the  enlightenment of his own soul, imprisoned in doubts, and for strength to  fulfil his hard task with discretion.    The gaze of the sufferer followed him as he took up his former position.    The prayer had refreshed his soul and restored him to cheerfulness of  spirit. He began to reflect what conduct he must observe towards the  princess.    He had not met Bent-Anat for the first time yesterday; on the contrary,  he had frequently seen her in holiday processions, and at the high  festivals in the Necropolis, and like all his young companions had  admired her proud beauty--admired it as the distant light of the stars,  or the evening-glow on the horizon.    Now he must approach this lady with words of reproof.    He pictured to himself the moment when he must advance to meet her, and  could not help thinking of his little tutor Chufu, above whom he towered  by two heads while he was still a boy, and who used to call up his  admonitions to him from below. It was true, he himself was tall  and slim, but he felt as if to-day he were to play the part towards  Bent-Anat of the much-laughed-at little tutor.    His sense of the comic was touched, and asserted itself at this  serious moment, and with such melancholy surroundings. Life is rich in  contrasts, and a susceptible and highly-strung human soul would break  down like a bridge under the measured tread of soldiers, if it were  allowed to let the burden of the heaviest thoughts and strongest  feelings work upon it in undisturbed monotony; but just as in music  every key-note has its harmonies, so when we cause one chord of our  heart to vibrate for long, all sorts of strange notes respond and clang,  often those which we least expect.    Pentaur's glance flew round the one low, over-filled room of the  paraschites' hut, and like a lightning flash the thought, \"How will the  princess and her train find room here?\" flew through his mind.    His fancy was lively, and vividly brought before him how the daughter of  the Pharaoh with a crown on her proud head would bustle into the silent  chamber, how the chattering courtiers would follow her, and how the  women by the walls, the physicians by the side of the sick girl, the  sleek white cat from the chest where she sat, would rise and throng  round her. There must be frightful confusion. Then he imagined how the  smart lords and ladies would keep themselves far from the unclean,"]]]
