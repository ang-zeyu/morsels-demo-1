'I'll get you the name of the branch  he's been promoted to, for I think I heard they'd moved him up one  already.' And the next day he brought me the name of the township of  Yea, some fifty miles north of Melbourne; but, with the vagueness which  characterized all his information, he was unable to say whether I  should find my relative there or not.    \"'He's a single man, and his initials are W. F.,' said the doctor, who  was certain enough of the immaterial points.  'He left his old post  several days ago, but it appears he's not due at the new one till the  New Year.  No doubt he'll go before then to take things over and settle  in.  You might find him up there and you might not.  If I were you I  should write.'    \"'That'll lose two days,' said I, 'and more if he isn't there,' for I'd  grown quite keen on this up-country manager, and I felt that if I could  get at him while the holidays were still on, a little conviviality  might help matters considerably.    \"'Then,' said the doctor, 'I should get a quiet horse and ride.  You  needn't use that hand.'    \"'Can't I go by train?'    \"'You can and you can't.  You would still have to ride.  I suppose  you're a horseman?'    \"'Yes.'    \"'Then I should certainly ride all the way.  It's a delightful road,  through Whittlesea and over the Plenty Ranges.  It'll give you some  idea of the bush, Mr. Raffles, and you'll see the sources of the water  supply of this city, sir.  You'll see where every drop of it comes  from, the pure Yan Yean! I wish I had time to ride with you.'    \"'But where can I get a horse?'    \"The doctor thought a moment.    \"'I've a mare of my own that's as fat as butter for want of work,' said  he.  'It would be a charity to me to sit on her back for a hundred  miles or so, and then I should know you'd have no temptation to use  that hand.'    \"'You're far too good!' I protested.    \"'You're A. J. Raffles,' he said.    \"And if ever there was a prettier compliment, or a finer instance of  even Colonial hospitality, I can only say, Bunny, that I never heard of  either.\"    He sipped his whiskey, threw away the stump of  his cigarette, and lit  another before continuing.    \"Well, I managed to write a line to W. F. with my own hand, which, as  you will gather, was not very badly wounded; it was simply this third  finger that was split and in splints; and next morning the doctor  packed me off on a bovine beast that would have done for an ambulance.  Half the team came up to see me start; the rest were rather sick with  me for not stopping to see the match out, as if I could help them to  win by watching them.  They little knew the game I'd got on myself, but  still less did I know the game I was going to play.    \"It was an interesting ride enough, especially after passing the place  called Whittlesea, a real wild township on the lower slope of the  ranges, where I recollect having a deadly meal of hot mutton and tea,  with the thermometer at three figures in the shade.  The first thirty  miles or so was a good metal road, too good to go half round the world  to ride on, but after Whittlesea it was a mere track over the ranges, a  track I often couldn't see and left entirely to the mare.  Now it  dipped into a gully and ran through a creek, and all the time the local  color was inches thick; gum-trees galore and parrots all colors of the  rainbow.  In one place a whole forest of gums had been ring-barked, and  were just as though they had been painted white, without a leaf or a  living thing for miles. And the first living thing I did meet was the  sort to give you the creeps; it was a riderless horse coming full tilt  through the bush, with the saddle twisted round and the stirrup-irons  ringing.  Without thinking, I had a shot at heading him with the  doctor's mare, and blocked him just enough to allow a man who came  galloping after to do the rest.    \"'Thank ye, mister,' growled the man, a huge chap in a red checked  shirt, with a beard like W. G. Grace, but the very devil of an  expression.    \"'Been an accident?' said I, reining up.    \"'Yes,' said he, scowling as though he defied me to ask any more.    \"'And a nasty one,' I said, 'if that's blood on the saddle!'    \"Well, Bunny, I may be a blackguard myself, but I don't think I ever  looked at a fellow as that chap looked at me.  But I stared him out,  and forced him to admit that it was blood on the twisted saddle, and  after that he became quite tame.  He told me exactly what had happened.  A mate of his had been dragged under a branch, and had his nose  smashed, but that was all; had sat tight after it till he dropped from  loss of blood; another mate was with him back in the bush.    \"As I've said already, Bunny, I wasn't the old stager that I am now--in  any respect--and we parted good enough friends.  He asked me which way  I was going, and, when I told him, he said I should save seven miles,  and get a good hour earlier to Yea, by striking off the track and  making for a peak that we could see through the trees, and following a  creek that I should see from the peak.  Don't smile, Bunny!  I began by  saying I was a child in those days.  Of course, the short cut was the  long way round; and it was nearly dark when that unlucky mare and I saw  the single street of Yea.    \"I was looking for the bank when a fellow in a white suit ran down from  the veranda.    \"'Mr. Raffles?' said he.    \"'Mr. Raffles,' said I, laughing as I shook his hand.    \"'You're late.'    \"'I was misdirected.'    \"'That all?  I'm relieved,' he said.  'Do you know what they are  saying?  There are some brand-new bushrangers on the road between  Whittlesea and this--a second Kelly gang!  They'd have caught a Tartar  in you, eh?'    \"'They would in you,' I retorted, and my tu quoque shut him up and  seemed to puzzle him. Yet there was much more sense in it than in his  compliment to me, which was absolutely pointless.    \"'I'm afraid you'll find things pretty rough,' he resumed, when he had  unstrapped my valise, and handed my reins to his man.  'It's lucky  you're a bachelor like myself.'    \"I could not quite see the point of this remark either, since, had I  been married, I should hardly have sprung my wife upon him in this  free-and-easy fashion.  I muttered the conventional sort of thing, and  then he said I should find it all right when I settled, as though I had  come to graze upon him for weeks!  'Well,' thought I, 'these Colonials  do take the cake for hospitality!'  And, still marvelling, I let him  lead me into the private part of the bank.    \"'Dinner will be ready in a quarter of an hour,' said he as we entered.  'I thought you might like a tub first, and you'll find all ready in the  room at the end of the passage.  Sing out if there's anything you want.  Your luggage hasn't turned up yet, by the way, but here's a letter that  came this morning.'    \"'Not for me?'    \"'Yes; didn't you expect one?'    \"'I certainly did not!'    \"'Well, here it is.'    \"And, as he lit me to my room, I read my own superscription of the  previous day--to W. F. Raffles!    \"Bunny, you've had your wind bagged at footer, I daresay; you know what  that's like?  All I can say is that my moral wind was bagged by that  letter as I hope, old chap, I have never yet bagged yours. I couldn't  speak.  I could only stand with my own letter in my hands until he had  the good taste to leave me by myself.    \"W. F. Raffles!  We had mistaken EACH OTHER for W. F.  Raffles--for the  new manager who had not yet arrived!  Small wonder we had conversed at  cross-purposes; the only wonder was that we had not discovered our  mutual mistake.  How the other man would have laughed!  But I--I could  not laugh.  By Jove, no, it was no laughing matter for me!  I saw the  whole thing in a flash, without a tremor, but with the direst  depression from my own single point of view.  Call it callous if you  like, Bunny, but remember that I was in much the same hole as you've  since been in yourself, and that I had counted on this W. F. Raffles  even as you counted on A. J.  I thought of the man with the W. G.  beard--the riderless horse and the bloody saddle--the deliberate  misdirection that had put me off the track and out of the way--and now  the missing manager and the report of bushrangers at this end.  But I  simply don't pretend to have felt any personal pity for a man whom I  had never seen; that kind of pity's usually cant; and besides, all mine  was needed for myself.    \"I was in as big a hole as ever.  What the devil was I to do?  I doubt  if I have sufficiently impressed upon you the absolute necessity of my  returning to Melbourne in funds.  As a matter of fact it was less the  necessity than my own determination which I can truthfully ascribe as  absolute.    \"Money I would have--but how--but how?  Would this stranger be open to  persuasion--if I told him the truth?  No; that would set us all  scouring the country for the rest of the night.  Why should I tell him?  Suppose I left him to find out his mistake ... would anything be  gained?  Bunny, I give you my word that I went in to dinner without a  definite intention in my head, or one premeditated lie upon my lips.  I  might do the decent, natural thing, and explain matters without loss of  time; on the other hand, there was no hurry.  I had not opened the  letter, and could always pretend I had not noticed the initials;  meanwhile something might turn up.  I could wait a little and see.  Tempted I already was, but as yet the temptation was vague, and its  very vagueness made me tremble.    \"'Bad news, I'm afraid?' said the manager, when at last I sat down at  his table.    \"'A mere annoyance,' I answered--I do assure you--on the spur of the  moment and nothing else. But my lie was told; my position was taken;  from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#13)"],[1,"A LOUD CRY, FOR LYING AT THE BOTTOM OF  THE STAIR WAS THE FORM OF HIS SON.\"]    \"Have any of you seen aught of my son Henry?\" he asked the men there.    \"No, my lord,\" one said in reply. \"I marked him by our side just before  the French got a footing at the other end of the wall, but I saw him not  afterwards.\"    \"He ran towards the steps at the corner there,\" Sir Eustace said, \"with a  message from me that the inner doors were to be closed. Come along, men,\"  he said to those with torches, and going to the corner of the wall  descended the steps, which were steep and narrow. He took a torch from one  of the men and held it over his head. As he neared the bottom he gave a  low cry and ran down the last few steps, where, lying at the bottom, was  the form of his son. He was stretched at full length, and there was a  terrible gash on his forehead. The knight knelt beside him and raised his  head, from which the steel cap had fallen; there was a deep stain of blood  on the pavement beneath. He placed his hand on the boy's heart and his ear  to his lips, and the men with the torches stood silently round. It was but  too evident what had happened. In his haste to carry the message Henry's  foot had slipped, and he had fallen headforemost down the steep steps, his  head coming in contact with the edge of one of them. Without a word Sir  Eustace raised the boy gently in his arms. His face was sufficient to tell  the men the news; their young lord was dead.    Sir Eustace carried him through the inner gate and up to the boy's own  room, and laid him down on his bed, then silently he went out again and  crossed the court to the keep. Dame Margaret was seeing to the wounded  being laid on the straw in the lower room, and did not notice him until he  touched her. She turned sharply round, his face was sufficient to tell her  the truth. She gave a low cry and stepped back a pace, and he moved  forwards and drew her to him.    \"Love,\" he said tenderly, \"God has taken him. He was fitter for heaven  than any of us; he was too gentle for this rough world of ours. We shall  mourn for him, but with him it is well.\"    Dame Margaret laid her head on his shoulder, and burst into a passion of  tears. Sir Eustace let her weep for a time, then he whispered:    \"You must be brave, my love. There will be other mourners here for their  dear ones who have died fighting for us; they will need your comfort. A  Villeroy could not die better than doing his duty. It was not by man's  hand that he fell, but God took him. His foot slipped in running down the  stair from the wall, and he must assuredly have died without a pang. Take  the priest with you; I will see to the wounded here. Father Gregory,\" he  went on, raising his voice, \"Dame Margaret has more need of you at the  present moment than have these brave fellows. A grievous misfortune has  befallen us. My son is dead; he fell while doing his duty. Do you take her  to his room; I give her to your charge for the present. I have my work to  do, and will see that your patients are well cared for.\"    There was a murmur of surprise and regret from the wounded and those who  had brought them in. The poor lad had been a general favourite in the  castle for his gentle and pleasant ways with all, though many a time the  rough soldiers had said among themselves, \"'Tis a pity that he was not a  girl, and the Lady Agnes a boy. He is more fit for a priest than for a  baron in times like these, for assuredly he will never grow into a stout  man-at-arms like his father.\" That a soldier should have been killed in  such a fight was to be expected, but that a gentle boy like this should  have fallen seemed strange and unnatural, and all sorrowed for him as well  as for their lord and lady, and the men forgot for a time the smart of  their wounds in their regret at his untimely death.    Sir Eustace went about his work quietly and earnestly, bound up the  soldiers' wounds, and saw as far as might be to their comfort. Their  number was not large, as it was only in the fight on the wall that aught  save their heads had been exposed, and those struck by cross-bow bolts had  for the most part fallen as they stood. The eight men brought in had  without exception received wounds from the swords of the French knights,  and though some of the gashes were broad and deep, none of them were  likely to prove fatal. Just as the knight had finished, Guy entered. He  had heard the news, which had spread like wildfire through the castle. The  lad's eyes were red, for he had been greatly attached to Henry, whose  constant companion he had been whenever the family had been at their  English home.    \"It is a strange fate, lad,\" Sir Eustace said, laying his hand upon Guy's  shoulder. \"You who have exposed yourself freely--for I marked you in the  fight--have come through scatheless, while Henry, whom I thought to keep  out of danger, has fallen. And what is your news?\"    \"There have been seventeen killed, my lord, besides Jean Bouvard, who was  struck in the face by one of the last crossbow bolts shot before they drew  off.\"    \"This is bad news indeed. I wondered why he came not to me as soon as we  had beaten them off, but I thought not of this. He was a good and  trustworthy fellow, and I shall miss him sorely. Seventeen, say you? It is  too many; and yet there might have been more. Who are they?\"    \"Four of our archers, Sir Eustace, one of our English men-at-arms, and six  of your French men-at-arms. These were all killed by cross-bow bolts and  arrows, Two of your tenants, Pierre Leroix and Jules Beaune, and four of  their men fell on the wall when the French gained a footing there; three  were, I hear, unmarried men, the other has left a wife and three  children.\"    \"They shall be my care,\" the knight said. \"The wives of Leroix and Beaune  shall hold their farms free of dues until their eldest sons come of age.  Does all seem quiet without?\"    \"All is quiet, my lord; but as I left the wall but now a knight with a  white flag and four torch-bearers was coming down the slope towards the  outwork.\"    \"I will go there myself,\" Sir Eustace said; \"'tis likely they do but come  to ask for leave to carry off the dead and wounded, which we will gladly  let them do, for it will save us much trouble to-morrow.\"    It was as the knight had supposed, and he at once gave the permission  asked for, and in a short time a great number of men with torches came  down the slope and for the next two hours were occupied in carrying off  their dead and wounded comrades. A close watch was maintained all night,  though there was small fear of a renewal of the attack. At daybreak the  rear-guard of the enemy could be seen retiring, and a party of men-at-arms, under Sir Eustace himself, on going out to reconnoitre, found that  none had remained behind. A mound marked the place where their dead had  been buried in one great grave. Many of the mantlets had been removed, and  they doubted not that these had been used as litters for the conveyance of  the wounded. They afterwards heard that some four hundred and fifty men  had been killed, and that over a hundred, too sorely wounded to be able to  walk, had been carried away.    In the afternoon Henry was buried beneath the chapel in the castle, while  the men-at-arms and others were laid in the inner court-yard. Having  learned that the Orleanists, greatly disheartened at their heavy repulse,  had marched away to the south, the gates of the castle were opened. A  small number of the garrison were retained in the castle, and the rest  were sent out to aid the tenants in felling trees and getting up temporary  shelters near their former homes until these could be rebuilt as before.  For the time their wives and families were to remain in the castle.    All fear of another attack by the Orleanists speedily passed away. Artois  was, upon the whole, strongly Burgundian, and an army marching from  Flanders speedily brought the whole province over to that side. Nothing  was done towards commencing the work of rebuilding the farmhouses, for it  was evident that the castle might at any moment be again beleaguered.    Two months passed quietly. Sir Eustace busied himself in seeing that the  tenants were comfortably re-established in their temporary homes. The  Burgundians had again obtained several advantages, and as Sir Clugnet was  known to have marched away with his following to the assistance of the  Orleanists, who had of late fared badly, there was no fear of any fresh  attack being made upon the castle. One day a messenger rode in from the  Governor of Calais, who was personally known to Sir Eustace. The letter  that he carried was an important one. After the usual greeting it read:--    _For the love I bear you, Sir Eustace, I write to let you know that  there is a change in affairs. It seems that the Duke of Burgundy has but  been playing with our King Henry, and that the offer of a marriage was  made only in order to obtain assistance and the countenance of the king.  Being now, as it would seem, powerful enough to hold his own against his  enemies without such aid, the matter has fallen through. I have received a  royal order, which has also been sent to the governors of other English  towns, and it has been proclaimed everywhere by sound of trumpets, that  none of Henry's subjects of whatever rank should in any way interfere  between the two factions in France, nor go into France to serve either of  them by arms or otherwise under pain of death and confiscation of fortune.  But I would tell you for your private ear, that I have news that our king  is in correspondence with the Dukes of Berri, Orleans, and Bourbon, and  that it is like that he will shortly declare for that party, being  grievously offended at the treatment that he has received at the hands of  the Duke of Burgundy after having given him loyal help and assistance  which had, in no slight degree, assisted him in making"]]]
