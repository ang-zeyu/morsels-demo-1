Is this applicable to the states of mind also? Recall the shloka  of the Bhagavad-Gita in which it is said that the Jiva goes out  into the world, drawing round him the five senses and mind as  sixth. That may throw a little light on the subject. You have  five senses, the five ways of knowing, the five jnanendriyas or  organs of knowing. Only by these five senses can you know the  outer world. Western psychology says that nothing exists in  thought that does not exist in sensation. That is not true  universally; it is not true of the abstract mind, nor wholly of  the concrete. But there is a great deal of truth in it. Every  idea is a pentad. It is made up of five elements. Each element  making up the idea comes from one of the senses, and of these  there are at present five. Later on every idea will be a heptad,  made up of seven elements. For the present, each has five  qualities, which build up the idea. The mind unites the whole  together into a single thought, synthesises the five sensations.  If you think of an orange and analyse your thought of an orange,  you will find in it: colour, which comes through the eye;  fragrance, which comes through the nose; taste, which comes  through the tongue; roughness or smoothness, which comes through  the sense of touch; and you would hear musical notes made by the  vibrations of the molecules, coming through the sense of hearing,  were it keener. If you had a perfect sense of hearing. you would  hear the sound of the orange also, for wherever there is  vibration there is sound. All this, synthesised by the mind into  one idea, is an orange. That is the root reason for the  \"association of ideas\". It is not only that a fragrance recalls  the scene and the circumstances under which the fragrance was  observed, but because every impression is made through all the  five senses and, therefore, when one is stimulated, the others  are recalled. The mind is like a prism. If you put a prism in the  path of a ray of white light, it will break it up into its seven  constituent rays and seven colours will appear. Put another prism  in the path of these seven rays, and as they pass through the  prism, the process is reversed and the seven become one white  light. The mind is like the second prism. It takes in the five  sensations that enter through the senses, and combines them into  a single precept. As at the present stage of evolution the senses  are five only, it unites the five sensations into one idea. What  the white ray is to the seven- coloured light, that a thought or  idea is to the fivefold sensation. That is the meaning of the  much controverted Sutra: \"Vrittayah panchatayych,\" \"the vrittis,  or modes of the mind, are pentads.\" If you look at it in that  way, the later teachings will be more clearly understood.    As I have already said, that sentence, that nothing exists in  thought which is not in sensation, is not the whole truth. Manas,  the sixth sense, adds to the sensations its own pure elemental  nature. What is that nature that you find thus added? It is the  establishment of a relation, that is really what the mind adds.  All thinking is the \"establishment of relations,\" and the more  closely you look into that phrase, the more you will realise how  it covers all the varied processes of the mind. The very first  process of the mind is to become aware of an outside world.  However dimly at first, we become aware of something outside  ourselves--a process generally called perception. I use the more  general term \"establishing a relation,\" because that runs through  the whole of the mental processes, whereas perception is only a  single thing. To use a well-known simile, when a little baby  feels a pin pricking it, it is conscious of pain, but not at  first conscious of the pin, nor yet conscious of where exactly  the pin is. It does not recognise the part of the body in which  the pin is. There is no perception, for perception is defined as  relating a sensation to the object which causes the sensation.  You only, technically speaking, \"perceive\" when you make a  relation between the object and yourself. That is the very first  of these mental processes, following on the heels of sensation.  Of course, from the Eastern standpoint, sensation is a mental  function also, for the senses are part of the cognitive faculty,  but they are unfortunately classed with feelings in Western  psychology. Now having established that relation between yourself  and objects outside, what is the next process of the mind?  Reasoning: that is, the establishing of relations between  different objects, as perception is the establishment of your  relation with a single object. When you have perceived many  objects, then you begin to reason in order to establish relations  between them. Reasoning is the establishment of a new relation,  which comes out from the comparison of the different objects that  by perception you have established in relation with yourself, and  the result is a concept. This one phrase, \"establishment of  relations,\" is true all round. The whole process of thinking is  the establishment of relations, and it is natural that it should  be so, because the Supreme Thinker, by establishing a relation,  brought matter into existence. Just as He, by establishing that  primary relation between Himself and the Not-Self, makes a  universe possible, so do we reflect His powers in ourselves,  thinking by the same method, establishing relations, and thus  carrying out every intellectual process.          Pleasure and Pain        Let us pass again from that to another statement made by this  great teacher of Yoga: \"Pentads are of two kinds, painful and  non-painful.\" Why did he not say: \"painful and pleasant\"? Because  he was an accurate thinker, a logical thinker, and he uses the  logical division that includes the whole universe of discourse, A  and Not-A, painful and non-painful. There has been much  controversy among psychologists as to a third kind --indifferent.  Some psychologists divide all feelings into three: painful,  pleasant and indifferent. Feelings cannot be divided merely into  pain and pleasure, there is a third class, called indifference,  which is neither painful nor pleasant. Other psychologists say  that indifference is merely pain or pleasure that is not marked  enough to be called the one or the other. Now this controversy  and tangle into which psychologists have fallen might be avoided  if the primary division of feelings were a logical division. A  and Not-A--that is the only true and logical division. Patanjali  is absolutely logical and right. In order to avoid the quicksand  into which the modern psychologists have fallen, he divides all  vrittis, modes of mind, into painful and nonpainful.    There is, however, a psychological reason why we should say  \"pleasure and pain,\" although it is not a logical division. The  reason why there should be that classification is that the word  pleasure and the word pain express two fundamental states of  difference, not in the Self, but in the vehicles in which that  Self dwells. The Self, being by nature unlimited, is ever  pressing, so to say, against any boundaries which seek to limit  him. When these limitations give way a little before the constant  pressure of the Self, we feel \"pleasure,\" and when they resist or  contract, we feel \"pain\". They are not states of the Self so much  as states of the vehicles, and states of certain changes in  consciousness. Pleasure and pain belong to the Self as a whole,  and not to any aspect of the Self separately taken. When pleasure  and pain are marked off as belonging only to the desire nature,  the objection arises: \"Well, but in the exercise of the cognitive  faculty there is an intense pleasure. When you use the creative  faculty of the mind you are conscious of a profound joy in its  exercise, and yet that creative faculty can by no means be  classed with desire.\" The answer is: \"Pleasure belongs to the  Self as a whole. Where the vehicles yield themselves to the Self,  and permit it to 'expand' as is its eternal nature, then what is  called pleasure is felt.\" It has been rightly said: \"Pleasure is  a sense of moreness.\" Every time you feel pleasure, you will find  the word \"moreness\" covers the case. It will cover the lowest  condition of pleasure, the pleasure of eating. You are becoming  more by appropriating to yourself a part of the Not-Self, food.  You will find it true of the highest condition of bliss, union  with the Supreme. You become more by expanding yourself to His  infinity. When you have a phrase that can be applied to the  lowest and highest with which you are dealing, you may be fairly  sure it is all-inclusive, and that, therefore, \"pleasure is  moreness\" is a true statement. Similarly, pain is \"lessness\".    If you understand these things your philosophy of life will  become more practical, and you will be able to help more  effectively people who fall into evil ways. Take drink. The real  attraction of drinking lies in the fact that, in the first stages  of it, a more keen and vivid life is felt. That stage is  overstepped in the case of the man who gets drunk, and then the  attraction ceases. The attraction lies in the first stages, and  many people have experienced that, who would never dream of  becoming drunk. Watch people who are taking wine and see how much  more lively and talkative they become. There lies the attraction,  the danger.    The real attraction in most coarse forms of excess is that they  give an added sense of life, and you will never be able to redeem  a man from his excess unless you know why he does it.  Understanding the attractiveness of the first step, the increase  of life, then you will be able to put your finger on the point of  temptation, and meet that in your argument with him.

This Indian said something to  the chief, which seemed to interest and excite them all. Chief  Manuelito advanced, and extending his hand in greeting, said that he  had often wished to meet me, the wizard who had beaten the champion  marksman of the Navajo tribe.    Several years before I had in the town of Cubero, at the request of  Mexican friends, shot a target match with the most renowned marksman of  the Navajo tribe, my pistol being pitted against the Navajo's rifle,  and had beaten him with a wonderful shot to the discomfiture and  distress of a trading band of Indians, who bet on their champion's  prowess and lost their goods to the knowing Mexicans.    The chief then requested me to favor them with an exhibition of my  skill. I readily assented and directed them to put up a target. They  placed a flat rock against the trunk of a pine tree at so great a  distance that it was barely distinguishable to the naked eye. I guessed  the distance and my shot fell just below the mark. Then I raised the  hind sight of my Winchester a notch and the next shot shattered the  stone to pieces. At this the Indians went wild. They had thought it  impossible for any man to perform this feat of marksmanship, and were  most enthusiastic in the profession of their admiration. Gladly would  they have adopted me into their tribe as a great chief or medicine man  had I wished to ally myself to them. There was the opportunity of a  lifetime, but I did not embrace it.    As the sun was now low in the heavens, I advised Don Juan to remain in  camp for the night and spoke to Chief Manuelito, expressing my wish to  pass through his country unmolested and without delay. The chief  assured me of his protection and bade us have no care. We slept soundly  that night, a band of Indians guarding our camp and herd under orders  of Manuelito, who had become my stanch friend and admirer. The  following day we came to the end of the reservation and soon crossed  the boundary line of New Mexico into Arizona.          CHAPTER IX.    IN ARIZONA      I left New Mexico with the intention of making Los Angeles in the  golden State my future home, and now, thirty years later, I have not  reached there yet. Vainly have I tried to break the thraldom of my  fate, for I did not know that here I was to meet face to face with the  mighty mystery of an ancient cult, the God of a long-forgotten  civilization, a psychic power which has ordered my path in life and  controlled my actions.    As its servant, at its bidding, I write this, and shall now unfold, and  in the course of this narrative give to the world a surprising  revelation of the power of ancient Aztec idols, which would be  incredible in the light of our twentieth century of Christian  civilization if it were not sustained by the evidence of undeniable  facts.    Our road led through a hilly country toward the Little Colorado River.  In the distance loomed the San Francisco Mountains, extinct craters  which had belched fire and lava long, long ago at the birth of Arizona,  when the earth was still in the travail of creation. We forded the  Little Colorado at Sunset Crossing, a lonely colony, where a few  Mormons were the only inhabitants of a vast area of wilderness. We were  headed due west toward a mesa rising abruptly from the plateau which we  were then traversing. This mesa was again capped by a chain of lofty  peaks, one of the Mogollon mountain ranges. We ascended the towering  mesa through the difficult Chavez pass, which is named after its  discoverer, the noted Mexican, Colonel Francisco Chavez, who may be  remembered as a representative in Congress of the United States, for  the Territory of New Mexico. A day's heavy toil brought us to the  summit of the mesa, which was a beautiful place, but unspeakably  lonesome. This wonderful highland is a malpais or lava formation and  densely covered with a forest of stately pines and mountain juniper.  Strange to say, vegetation thrives incredibly in the rocky lava; a  knee-high growth of the most nutritious grama grasses, indigent to this  region, rippled in the breeze like waves of a golden sea and we saw  numerous signs of deer, antelope, and turkey. Our road, a mere trail,  wound over this plateau, which was a veritable impenetrable jungle in  places, a part of the great Coconino forest. Think and wonder! An  unbroken forest of ten thousand square miles, it is said to be the most  extensive woodland on the face of the globe. This trail was the worst  road to travel I have seen or expect ever to pass over. The wagons  moved as ships tossed on a stormy sea, chuck! chuck! from boulder to  boulder, without intermittence. We found delicious spring water about  noon and passed a most remarkable place later in the day. This must  have been the pit of a volcano. A few steps aside from the road you  might lean over the precipice and look straight down into a great,  round crater, so deep that it made a person dizzy. At the bottom there  was a ranch house, a small lake and a cultivated field, the whole being  apparently ten acres in area. I looked straight down on a man who was  walking near the house and appeared no larger than a little doll and  his dog seemed to be the size of a grasshopper, but we heard the dog  bark and heard the cackling of hens quite plainly. On one side of this  pit there was a break in the formation, which made this curious place  accessible by trail.    We had been advised that we would find a natural tank of rain water in  the vicinity of this place and camped there at nightfall. We turned our  stock out, but our herders did not find the promised water. Our cook  reported that there was not a drop of water in camp, as the spigot of  his water tank had been loosened by the roughness of the road and all  the water was lost. Now this would have been a matter of small  consequence if Don Juan had not been taken ill suddenly. He threw  himself on the ground and cried for water. \"Agua, por Dios!\" (Water,  for God's sake) he cried, \"or I shall die.\" \"Why, Don Juan,\" I said,  \"there is no water here. I advise you to wait till moonrise when the  cattle are rested and then leave for the next watering place, which is  Beaver Head, at the foot of the mesa; we ought to reach there about ten  o'clock to-morrow morning. Surely until then you can endure a little  thirst!\" \"Amiga, I cannot, I am dying,\" moaned Don Juan, in great  distress. As I suspected that he had lost his nerve on the Navajo  reservation, I felt greatly annoyed, and when he became frantic in his  cries I promised to go down to Beaver Creek to get him a drink of  water, for I recalled to mind his little daughter who bid me farewell  with these words: \"Adios, Senor Americano, I charge you with the care  of my padrecito. If you promise me, I know that he will return to me  safely.\"    I set out on my long night-walk, stumbling over rocks and boulders in  the darkness. It was a beautiful night, the crisp atmosphere was laden  with the fragrant exhalation of the nut pines and junipers and there  was not a breath of air stirring. I got down to water at midnight, the  time of moonrise, filled my canteen and started on the return trip.  Slowly I reascended the steep mesa, and when I reached the summit I sat  down on a rock in a thicket of junipers. The moon had now risen above  the trees and cast its dim light over an enchanting scene. The sense of  utter loneliness, a homesickness, a feeling of premonition, stole over  me, and weirdly I sensed the presence of I knew not what. From the  shadows spoke an owl, sadly, anxiously, \"Hoo, hoo! Where are you? You!\"  and his mate answered him tenderly, seductively, \"Tee, hee! Come to me!  Me!\"    In the west, far, far away, clustered a range of mountains, spread out  like an enormous horse-shoe and in its center arose the form of a  solitary hill. In the heavens from the east drifted a white, ragged  cloud. The solitary hill seemed to rise high and higher and all the  mountains bowed before it. The spectral cloud resolved itself into a  terrible vision which enveloped the central hill. Great Heavens! Again  I saw the phantom dog and fancied that I heard shrill screams of  \"Perro, perro, gringo perro!\" A crackling noise, a coming shadow, and  forward I fell on my face, ever on the alert, ever ready. An unearthly  yell and a great body flew over, fierce claws grazing me. Two balls of  fire shone in the bush, but my rifle cracked and a great lion fell in  its tracks. I expected my companions to meet me soon, coming my way.  Instead, I found them, after my all-night's walk, snugly camped where I  had left them. Don Juan explained that with God's favor they had found  the water soon after I had left them. He said that they had called loud  and long after me, but I did not seem to hear.    This day we descended the mesa and entered the valley of the Verde  River, one of Arizona's permanent water courses. This valley is  cultivated for at least forty miles from its source to where it enters  precipitous mountains. We forded the crystal waters of the river at  Camp Verde, an army post, and crossed another range of mountains and  several valleys into a comparatively open country, and on the night of  a day late in November we camped on Lynx Creek, and were then within a  half day's travel of our destination.          CHAPTER X.    AT THE SHRINE OF A \"SPHINX OF AZTLAN\"      Not a drop of rain had fallen on us since we left the Rio Grande, the  days were as summer in a northern climate, but the nights were quite  chill, the effect of an altitude of five thousand feet above sea level.  The country had lost its appearance of loneliness, for we passed  several parties of miners and heard the heavy booming of giant powder  at intervals, and from various directions all through the day.    We were joined by a jolly party of miners who were eager for"]]]
