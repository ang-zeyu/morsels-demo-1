If upon opening fruit you find it is not perfect, or there is a  worm in it, pass your plate quietly and without remark to the  waiter, who will bring you a clean one.    None but a low-bred clown will ever carry fruit or _bon bons_ away  from the table.    Drinking wine with people is an old custom, but it will now-adays  be found to exist only among the past or passing generation. If  you are, however, asked to take wine with any one, you should fill  your glass with the same sort of wine your friend has, and raise  it to your lips. You need only taste, not act upon the principle  of \"no heel-taps.\"    A man would be looked upon as a curiosity, nay, many would not  understand what he meant, who should at the present day propose a  \"sentiment\" before drinking wine.    Never spit from your mouth the skins of grapes, the stones or pips  of fruits. Receive them upon the prongs of your fork, laid  horizontally, and place them as conveniently as so inelegant a  process will allow upon the edge of your plate.    Never play with your fingers upon the table.    Never play with your knife and fork, fidget with your salt-cellar,  balance your spoon on your tumbler, make pills of your bread, or  perform any of those vulgar antics unfortunately too often seen at  table.    Never in conversation, illustrate your remarks by plans drawn upon  the table-cloth with your nail, or built of your knife, fork and  spoon.    Never stretch your feet out under the table, so as to touch those  of your opposite neighbor. It is quite as bad to put them up under  you upon the chair-bar, or curl them up under the chair itself.    Try to take an easy position at table, neither pressing closely up  to it, nor yet so far away as to risk depositing your food upon  the floor instead of conveying it to your mouth.    Never touch fruit with your fingers. If you wish to peel an apple,  a pear or a peach, hold the fruit on a fork in your left hand, and  peel with a silver knife in your right. Eat it in small slices cut  from the whole fruit, but never bite it, or anything else at  table. Need I say no fruit should ever be sucked at the table.    When the hostess thinks her lady friends have taken as much  dessert as they wish, she catches the eye of the principal among  them; an interchange of ocular telegraphing takes place, the  hostess rises, and with her all the company rise; the gentlemen  make a passage for the ladies to pass; the one who is nearest to  the door opens it, and holds it open until all the ladies have  passed out of the room.    As soon as the ladies have retired the gentlemen may resume their  seats for more wine and conversation, but it is a very poor  compliment to the lady guests to linger long in the dining-room.    The ladies upon leaving the dining-room, retire to the drawing-  room, and occupy themselves until the gentlemen again join them.  It is well for the hostess to have a reserve force for this  interval, of photographic albums, stereoscopes, annuals, new  music, in fact, all the ammunition she can provide to make this  often tedious interval pass pleasantly.    If you dine in the French fashion, the gentlemen rise with the  ladies, each offering his arm to the lady he escorted to dinner,  and all proceed to the drawing-room together.    If the gentlemen remain to have coffee served in the dining-room,  tea may be served in the drawing-room to the ladies.    Upon returning to the drawing-room the gentlemen should never  cluster round the door, but join the ladies at once, striving to  repay the hospitality of the hostess by making themselves as  agreeable as possible to the guests.    From two to three hours after dinner is the proper time to leave  the house.    If the dinner is for the gentlemen guests alone, and the lady of  house presides, her duties are over when she rises after dessert.  The gentlemen do not expect to find her in the drawing-room again.  In this case cigars may be served with the coffee, and then the  servants may retire, unless especially summoned to wait. If  smoking is indulged in, have placed upon the table a number of  small match boxes, ashes receivers, and between the chairs  spittoons. And here let me add a few words upon smoking taken from  an English authority, but which, with a few exceptions will apply  equally well to lovers of the weed upon this side of the water. He  says:    \"But what shall I say of the fragrant weed which Raleigh taught  our gallants to puff in capacious bowls; which a royal pedant  denounced in a famous 'Counterblast,' which his flattering,  laureate, Ben Jonson, ridiculed to please his master; which our  wives and sisters protest gives rise to the dirtiest and most  unsociable habit a man can indulge in; of which some fair flowers  declare that they love the smell, and others that they will never  marry an indulger (which, by the way, they generally end in  doing); which has won a fame over more space and among better men  than Noah's grape has ever done; which doctors still dispute  about, and boys get sick over; but which is the solace of the  weary laborer; the support of the ill-fed; the refresher of  overwrought brains; the soother of angry fancies; the boast of the  exquisite; the excuse of the idle; the companion of the  philosopher; and the tenth muse of the poet. I will go neither  into the the medical nor the moral questions about the dreamy  calming cloud. I will content myself so far with saying what may  be said for everything that can bless and curse mankind, that in  moderation it is at least harmless; but what is moderate and what  is not, must be determined in each individual case, according to  the habits and constitution of the subjects. If it cures asthma,  it may destroy digestion; if it soothes the nerves, it may, in  excess, produce a chronic irritability.    \"But I will regard it in a social point of view, and, first as a  narcotic, notice its effects on the individual character. I  believe then, that in moderation it diminishes the violence of the  passions, and particularly that of the temper. Interested in the  subject, I have taken care to seek instances of members of the  same family having the same violent temper by inheritance, of whom  the one has been calmed down by smoking, and the other gone on in  his passionate course. I believe that it induces a habit of calm  reflectiveness, which causes us to take less prejudiced, perhaps  less zealous views of life, and to be therefore less irritable in  our converse with our fellow-creatures. I am inclined to think  that the clergy, the squirearchy and the peasantry, are the most  prejudiced and most violent classes in this country (England);  there may be other reasons for this, but it is noteworthy that  these are the classes which smoke least. On the other hand, I  confess that it induces a certain lassitude, and a lounging, easy  mode of life, which is fatal both to the precision of manners and  the vivacity of conversation. The mind of a smoker is  contemplative rather than active, and if the weed cures our  irritability, it kills our wit. I believe that it is a fallacy to  suppose that it encourages drinking. There is more drinking and  less smoking in England than in any other country of the the  civilized world. There was more drinking among the gentry of last  century, who never smoked at all. Smoke and wine do not go well  together. Coffee and beer are its best accompaniments; and the one  cannot intoxicate, the other must be largely imbibed to do so. I  have observed among young bachelors that very little wine is drunk  in their chambers, and that beer is gradually taking its place.  The cigar, too, is an excuse for rising from the dinner-table,  where there are no ladies to go to.    \"In another point of view, I am inclined to think that smoking has  conduced to make the society of men, when alone, less riotous,  less quarrelsome and even less vicious than it was. Where young  men now blow a common cloud, they were formerly driven to a  fearful consumption of wine; and this in their heads, they were  ready and roused to any iniquity. But the pipe is the bachelors  wife. With it, he can endure solitude longer, and is not forced  into low society in order to shun it. With it, too, the idle can  pass many an hour, which otherwise he would have given, not to  work, but to extravagant follies. With it, he is no longer  restless, and impatient for excitement of any kind. We never hear  now of young blades issuing in bands from their wine to beat the  watch or disturb the slumbering citizens, as we did thirty or  forty years ago, when smoking was still a rarity; they are all  puffing harmlessly in their chambers now. But, on the other hand,  I foresee with dread a too tender allegiance to the pipe, to the  destruction of good society, and the abandonment of the ladies. No  wonder they hate it, dear creatures! the pipe is the worst rival a  woman can have, and it is one whose eyes she cannot scratch out;  who improves with age, while she herself declines; who has an art  which no woman possesses, that of never wearying her devotee; who  is silent, yet a companion; costs little, yet gives much pleasure;  who, lastly, never upbraids, and always yields the same joy. Ah!  this is a powerful rival to wife or maid; and no wonder that at  last the woman succumbs, consents, and, rather than lose her lord  or master, even supplies the hated herb with her own fair hands.    \"There are rules to limit this indulgence. One must never smoke,  nor even ask to smoke, in the company of the fair. If they know  that in a few minutes you will be running off to your cigar, the  fair will do well--say it is in a garden, or so--to allow you to  bring it out and smoke it there.    \"One must never smoke, again, in the streets--that is, in  daylight. The deadly crime may be committed, like burglary, after  dark, but not before.    \"O"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],[0,"The King in Yellow (#13)"],[1," Steep stairways pitch down to doors  that open on the court. The ground floors are occupied by shops of  second-hand dealers, and by iron workers. All day long the place rings  with the clink of hammers and the clang of metal bars.    Unsavoury as it is below, there is cheerfulness, and comfort, and hard,  honest work above.    Five flights up are the ateliers of architects and painters, and the  hiding-places of middle-aged students like myself who want to live alone.  When I first came here to live I was young, and not alone.    I had to walk a while before any conveyance appeared, but at last, when I  had almost reached the Arc de Triomphe again, an empty cab came along and  I took it.    From the Arc to the Rue de Rennes is a drive of more than half an hour,  especially when one is conveyed by a tired cab horse that has been at the  mercy of Sunday fete-makers.    There had been time before I passed under the Dragon's wings to meet my  enemy over and over again, but I never saw him once, and now refuge was  close at hand.    Before the wide gateway a small mob of children were playing. Our  concierge and his wife walked among them, with their black poodle,  keeping order; some couples were waltzing on the side-walk. I returned  their greetings and hurried in.    All the inhabitants of the court had trooped out into the street. The  place was quite deserted, lighted by a few lanterns hung high up, in  which the gas burned dimly.    My apartment was at the top of a house, halfway down the court, reached  by a staircase that descended almost into the street, with only a bit of  passage-way intervening, I set my foot on the threshold of the open door,  the friendly old ruinous stairs rose before me, leading up to rest and  shelter. Looking back over my right shoulder, I saw _him,_ ten paces  off. He must have entered the court with me.    He was coming straight on, neither slowly, nor swiftly, but straight on  to me. And now he was looking at me. For the first time since our eyes  encountered across the church they met now again, and I knew that the  time had come.    Retreating backward, down the court, I faced him. I meant to escape by  the entrance on the Rue du Dragon. His eyes told me that I never should  escape.    It seemed ages while we were going, I retreating, he advancing, down the  court in perfect silence; but at last I felt the shadow of the archway,  and the next step brought me within it. I had meant to turn here and  spring through into the street. But the shadow was not that of an  archway; it was that of a vault. The great doors on the Rue du Dragon  were closed. I felt this by the blackness which surrounded me, and at the  same instant I read it in his face. How his face gleamed in the darkness,  drawing swiftly nearer! The deep vaults, the huge closed doors, their  cold iron clamps were all on his side. The thing which he had threatened  had arrived: it gathered and bore down on me from the fathomless shadows;  the point from which it would strike was his infernal eyes. Hopeless, I  set my back against the barred doors and defied him.      There was a scraping of chairs on the stone floor, and a rustling as the  congregation rose. I could hear the Suisse's staff in the south aisle,  preceding Monseigneur C---- to the sacristy.    The kneeling nuns, roused from their devout abstraction, made their  reverence and went away. The fashionable lady, my neighbour, rose also,  with graceful reserve. As she departed her glance just flitted over my  face in disapproval.    Half dead, or so it seemed to me, yet intensely alive to every trifle, I  sat among the leisurely moving crowd, then rose too and went toward the  door.    I had slept through the sermon. Had I slept through the sermon? I looked  up and saw him passing along the gallery to his place. Only his side I  saw; the thin bent arm in its black covering looked like one of those  devilish, nameless instruments which lie in the disused torture-chambers  of mediaeval castles.    But I had escaped him, though his eyes had said I should not. _Had_  I escaped him? That which gave him the power over me came back out of  oblivion, where I had hoped to keep it. For I knew him now. Death and the  awful abode of lost souls, whither my weakness long ago had sent  him--they had changed him for every other eye, but not for mine. I had  recognized him almost from the first; I had never doubted what he was  come to do; and now I knew while my body sat safe in the cheerful little  church, he had been hunting my soul in the Court of the Dragon.    I crept to the door: the organ broke out overhead with a blare. A  dazzling light filled the church, blotting the altar from my eyes. The  people faded away, the arches, the vaulted roof vanished. I raised my  seared eyes to the fathomless glare, and I saw the black stars hanging in  the heavens: and the wet winds from the lake of Hali chilled my face.    And now, far away, over leagues of tossing cloud-waves, I saw the moon  dripping with spray; and beyond, the towers of Carcosa rose behind the  moon.    Death and the awful abode of lost souls, whither my weakness long ago had  sent him, had changed him for every other eye but mine. And now I heard  _his voice_, rising, swelling, thundering through the flaring light,  and as I fell, the radiance increasing, increasing, poured over me in  waves of flame. Then I sank into the depths, and I heard the King in  Yellow whispering to my soul: \"It is a fearful thing to fall into the  hands of the living God!\"          THE YELLOW SIGN      \"Let the red dawn surmise      What we shall do,    When this blue starlight dies      And all is through.\"      I    There are so many things which are impossible to explain! Why should  certain chords in music make me think of the brown and golden tints of  autumn foliage? Why should the Mass of Sainte Cecile bend my thoughts  wandering among caverns whose walls blaze with ragged masses of virgin  silver? What was it in the roar and turmoil of Broadway at six o'clock  that flashed before my eyes the picture of a still Breton forest where  sunlight filtered through spring foliage and Sylvia bent, half curiously,  half tenderly, over a small green lizard, murmuring: \"To think that this  also is a little ward of God!\"    When I first saw the watchman his back was toward me. I looked at him  indifferently until he went into the church. I paid no more attention to  him than I had to any other man who lounged through Washington Square  that morning, and when I shut my window and turned back into my studio I  had forgotten him. Late in the afternoon, the day being warm, I raised  the window again and leaned out to get a sniff of air. A man was standing  in the courtyard of the church, and I noticed him again with as little  interest as I had that morning. I looked across the square to where the  fountain was playing and then, with my mind filled with vague impressions  of trees, asphalt drives, and the moving groups of nursemaids and  holiday-makers, I started to walk back to my easel. As I turned, my  listless glance included the man below in the churchyard. His face was  toward me now, and with a perfectly involuntary movement I bent to see  it. At the same moment he raised his head and looked at me. Instantly I  thought of a coffin-worm. Whatever it was about the man that repelled me  I did not know, but the impression of a plump white grave-worm was so  intense and nauseating that I must have shown it in my expression, for he  turned his puffy face away with a movement which made me think of a  disturbed grub in a chestnut.    I went back to my easel and motioned the model to resume her pose. After  working a while I was satisfied that I was spoiling what I had done as  rapidly as possible, and I took up a palette knife and scraped the colour  out again. The flesh tones were sallow and unhealthy, and I did not  understand how I could have painted such sickly colour into a study which  before that had glowed with healthy tones.    I looked at Tessie. She had not changed, and the clear flush of health  dyed her neck and cheeks as I frowned.    \"Is it something I've done?\" she said.    \"No,--I've made a mess of this arm, and for the life of me I can't see  how I came to paint such mud as that into the canvas,\" I replied.    \"Don't I pose well?\" she insisted.    \"Of course, perfectly.\"    \"Then it's not my fault?\"    \"No. It's my own.\"    \"I am very sorry,\" she said.    I told her she could rest while I applied rag and turpentine to the  plague spot on my canvas, and she went off to smoke a cigarette and look  over the illustrations in the _Courrier Francais_.    I did not know whether it was something in the turpentine or a defect in  the canvas, but the more I scrubbed the more that gangrene seemed to  spread. I worked like a beaver to get it out, and yet the disease  appeared to creep from limb to limb of the study before me. Alarmed, I  strove to arrest it, but now the colour on the breast changed and the  whole figure seemed to absorb the infection as a sponge soaks up water.  Vigorously I plied palette-knife, turpentine, and scraper, thinking all  the time what a _seance_ I should hold with Duval who had sold me  the canvas; but soon I noticed that it was not the canvas which was  defective nor yet the colours of Edward. \"It must be the turpentine,\" I  thought angrily, \"or else my eyes have become so blurred and confused by  the afternoon light that I can't see straight.\" I called Tessie, the  model. She came and leaned over my chair blowing rings of smoke into the  air.    \"What _have_ you been doing to it?\" she exclaimed    \"Nothing,\" I growled, \"it must be this turpentine!\"    \"What a horrible colour it is now,\" she continued. \"Do you think my flesh  resembles green cheese?\"    \"No, I don't,\" I said angrily; \"did you ever know me to paint like that  before?\"    \"No, indeed!\"    \"Well, then!\"    \"It must be the turpentine, or"]]]
