[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6317"],[0,"Sailing Alone Around the World (#13)"],[1,"  gloomy aspect to the scene.    I was not to be let off easy. The Virgins would collect tribute even  from the _Spray_ passing their promontory. Fitful rain-squalls from  the northwest followed the northeast gale. I reefed the sloop's sails,  and sitting in the cabin to rest my eyes, I was so strongly impressed  with what in all nature I might expect that as I dozed the very air I  breathed seemed to warn me of danger. My senses heard \"_Spray_ ahoy!\"  shouted in warning. I sprang to the deck, wondering who could be there  that knew the _Spray_ so well as to call out her name passing in the  dark; for it was now the blackest of nights all around, except away in  the southwest, where the old familiar white arch, the terror of Cape  Horn, rapidly pushed up by a southwest gale. I had only a moment to  douse sail and lash all solid when it struck like a shot from a  cannon, and for the first half-hour it was something to be remembered  by way of a gale. For thirty hours it kept on blowing hard. The sloop  could carry no more than a three-reefed mainsail and forestaysail;  with these she held on stoutly and was not blown out of the strait. In  the height of the squalls in this gale she doused all sail, and this  occurred often enough.    After this gale followed only a smart breeze, and the _Spray_, passing  through the narrows without mishap, cast anchor at Sandy Point on  February 14, 1896.    [Illustration: The course of the _Spray_ through the Strait of  Magellan.]    Sandy Point (Punta Arenas) is a Chilean coaling-station, and boasts  about two thousand inhabitants, of mixed nationality, but mostly  Chileans. What with sheep-farming, gold-mining, and hunting, the  settlers in this dreary land seemed not the worst off in the world.  But the natives, Patagonian and Fuegian, on the other hand, were as  squalid as contact with unscrupulous traders could make them. A large  percentage of the business there was traffic in \"fire-water.\" If there  was a law against selling the poisonous stuff to the natives, it was  not enforced. Fine specimens of the Patagonian race, looking smart in  the morning when they came into town, had repented before night of  ever having seen a white man, so beastly drunk were they, to say  nothing about the peltry of which they had been robbed.    The port at that time was free, but a customhouse was in course of  construction, and when it is finished, port and tariff dues are to be  collected. A soldier police guarded the place, and a sort of vigilante  force besides took down its guns now and then; but as a general thing,  to my mind, whenever an execution was made they killed the wrong man.  Just previous to my arrival the governor, himself of a jovial turn of  mind, had sent a party of young bloods to foray a Fuegian settlement  and wipe out what they could of it on account of the recent massacre  of a schooner's crew somewhere else. Altogether the place was quite  newsy and supported two papers--dailies, I think. The port captain, a  Chilean naval officer, advised me to ship hands to fight Indians in  the strait farther west, and spoke of my stopping until a gunboat  should be going through, which would give me a tow. After canvassing  the place, however, I found only one man willing to embark, and he on  condition that I should ship another \"mon and a doog.\" But as no one  else was willing to come along, and as I drew the line at dogs, I said  no more about the matter, but simply loaded my guns. At this point in  my dilemma Captain Pedro Samblich, a good Austrian of large  experience, coming along, gave me a bag of carpet-tacks, worth more  than all the fighting men and dogs of Tierra del Fuego. I protested  that I had no use for carpet-tacks on board. Samblich smiled at my  want of experience, and maintained stoutly that I would have use for  them. \"You must use them with discretion,\" he said; \"that is to say,  don't step on them yourself.\" With this remote hint about the use of  the tacks I got on all right, and saw the way to maintain clear decks  at night without the care of watching.    [Illustration: The man who wouldn't ship without another \"mon and a  doog.\"]    Samblich was greatly interested in my voyage, and after giving me the  tacks he put on board bags of biscuits and a large quantity of smoked  venison. He declared that my bread, which was ordinary sea-biscuits  and easily broken, was not nutritious as his, which was so hard that I  could break it only with a stout blow from a maul. Then he gave me,  from his own sloop, a compass which was certainly better than mine,  and offered to unbend her mainsail for me if I would accept it. Last of  all, this large-hearted man brought out a bottle of Fuegian gold-dust  from a place where it had been _cached_ and begged me to help myself  from it, for use farther along on the voyage. But I felt sure of  success without this draft on a friend, and I was right. Samblich's  tacks, as it turned out, were of more value than gold.    [Illustration: A Fuegian Girl.]    The port captain finding that I was resolved to go, even alone, since  there was no help for it, set up no further objections, but advised  me, in case the savages tried to surround me with their canoes, to  shoot straight, and begin to do it in time, but to avoid killing them  if possible, which I heartily agreed to do. With these simple  injunctions the officer gave me my port clearance free of charge, and  I sailed on the same day, February 19, 1896. It was not without  thoughts of strange and stirring adventure beyond all I had yet  encountered that I now sailed into the country and very core of the  savage Fuegians.    A fair wind from Sandy Point brought me on the first day to St.  Nicholas Bay, where, so I was told, I might expect to meet savages;  but seeing no signs of life, I came to anchor in eight fathoms of  water, where I lay all night under a high mountain. Here I had my  first experience with the terrific squalls, called williwaws, which  extended from this point on through the strait to the Pacific. They  were compressed gales of wind that Boreas handed down over the hills  in chunks. A full-blown williwaw will throw a ship, even without sail  on, over on her beam ends; but, like other gales, they cease now and  then, if only for a short time.    February 20 was my birthday, and I found myself alone, with hardly so  much as a bird in sight, off Cape Froward, the southernmost point of  the continent of America. By daylight in the morning I was getting my  ship under way for the bout ahead.    The sloop held the wind fair while she ran thirty miles farther on her  course, which brought her to Fortescue Bay, and at once among the  natives' signal-fires, which blazed up now on all sides. Clouds flew  over the mountain from the west all day; at night my good east wind  failed, and in its stead a gale from the west soon came on. I gained  anchorage at twelve o'clock that night, under the lee of a little  island, and then prepared myself a cup of coffee, of which I was  sorely in need; for, to tell the truth, hard beating in the heavy  squalls and against the current had told on my strength. Finding that  the anchor held, I drank my beverage, and named the place Coffee  Island. It lies to the south of Charles Island, with only a narrow  channel between.    [Illustration: Looking west from Fortescue Bay, where the _Spray_ was  chased by Indians. (From a photograph.)]    By daylight the next morning the _Spray_ was again under way, beating  hard; but she came to in a cove in Charles Island, two and a half  miles along on her course. Here she remained undisturbed two days,  with both anchors down in a bed of kelp. Indeed, she might have  remained undisturbed indefinitely had not the wind moderated; for  during these two days it blew so hard that no boat could venture out  on the strait, and the natives being away to other hunting-grounds,  the island anchorage was safe. But at the end of the fierce wind-storm  fair weather came; then I got my anchors, and again sailed out upon  the strait.    Canoes manned by savages from Fortescue now came in pursuit. The wind  falling light, they gained on me rapidly till coming within hail, when  they ceased paddling, and a bow-legged savage stood up and called to  me, \"Yammerschooner! yammerschooner!\" which is their begging term. I  said, \"No!\" Now, I was not for letting on that I was alone, and so I  stepped into the cabin, and, passing through the hold, came out at the  fore-scuttle, changing my clothes as I went along. That made two men.  Then the piece of bowsprit which I had sawed off at Buenos Aires, and  which I had still on board, I arranged forward on the lookout, dressed  as a seaman, attaching a line by which I could pull it into motion.  That made three of us, and we didn't want to \"yammerschooner\"; but for  all that the savages came on faster than before. I saw that besides  four at the paddles in the canoe nearest to me, there were others in  the bottom, and that they were shifting hands often. At eighty yards I  fired a shot across the bows of the nearest canoe, at which they all  stopped, but only for a moment. Seeing that they persisted in coming  nearer, I fired the second shot so close to the chap who wanted to  \"yammerschooner\" that he changed his mind quickly enough and bellowed  with fear, \"Bueno jo via Isla,\" and sitting down in his canoe, he  rubbed his starboard cat-head for some time. I was thinking of the  good port captain's advice when I pulled the trigger, and must have  aimed pretty straight; however, a miss was as good as a mile for Mr.  \"Black Pedro,\" as he it was, and no other, a leader in several bloody  massacres. He made for the island now, and the others followed him. I  knew by his Spanish lingo and by his full beard that he was the  villain I have named, a renegade mongrel, and the worst murderer in  Tierra del Fuego. The authorities had been in search of him for two  years. The Fuegians "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6322"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#13)"],[1,"of the torrid zone, the centigrade  thermometer rose no higher than 18 degrees. The phosphorescence of  the ocean seemed to augment the mass of light diffused through the  air. After midnight, great black clouds rising behind the volcano  shrouded at intervals the moon and the beautiful constellation of  the Scorpion. We beheld lights carried to and fro on shore, which  were probably those of fishermen preparing for their labours. We  had been occasionally employed, during our passage, in reading the  old voyages of the Spaniards, and these moving lights recalled to  our fancy those which Pedro Gutierrez, page of Queen Isabella, saw  in the isle of Guanahani, on the memorable night of the discovery  of the New World.    On the 17th, in the morning, the horizon was foggy, and the sky  slightly covered with vapour. The outlines of the mountains of  Lancerota appeared stronger: the humidity, increasing the  transparency of the air, seemed at the same time to have brought  the objects nearer our view. This phenomenon is well known to all  who have made hygrometrical observations in places whence the chain  of the Higher Alps or of the Andes is seen. We passed through the  channel which divides the isle of Alegranza from Montana Clara,  taking soundings the whole way; and we examined the archipelago of  small islands situated northward of Lancerota. In the midst of this  archipelago, which is seldom visited by vessels bound for  Teneriffe, we were singularly struck with the configuration of the  coasts. We thought ourselves transported to the Euganean mountains  in the Vicentin, or the banks of the Rhine near Bonn. The form of  organized beings varies according to the climate, and it is that  extreme variety which renders the study of the geography of plants  and animals so attractive; but rocks, more ancient perhaps than the  causes which have produced the difference of the climate on the  globe, are the same in both hemispheres. The porphyries containing  vitreous feldspar and hornblende, the phonolite, the greenstone,  the amygdaloids, and the basalt, have forms almost as invariable as  simple crystallized substances. In the Canary Islands, and in the  mountains of Auvergne, in the Mittelgebirge in Bohemia, in Mexico,  and on the banks of the Ganges, the formation of trap is indicated  by a symmetrical disposition of the mountains, by truncated cones,  sometimes insulated, sometimes grouped, and by elevated plains,  both extremities of which are crowned by a conical rising.    The whole western part of Lancerota, of which we had a near view,  bears the appearance of a country recently convulsed by volcanic  eruptions. Everything is black, parched, and stripped of vegetable  mould. We distinguished, with our glasses, stratified basalt in  thin and steeply-sloping strata. Several hills resembled the Monte  Novo, near Naples, or those hillocks of scoria and ashes which the  opening earth threw up in a single night at the foot of the volcano  of Jorullo, in Mexico. In fact, the abbe Viera relates, that in  1730, more than half the island changed its appearance. The great  volcano, which we have just mentioned, and which the inhabitants  call the volcano of Temanfaya, spread desolation over a most  fertile and highly cultivated region: nine villages were entirely  destroyed by the lavas. This catastrophe had been preceded by a  tremendous earthquake, and for several years shocks equally violent  were felt. This last phenomenon is so much the more singular, as it  seldom happens after an eruption, when the elastic vapours have  found vent by the crater, after the ejection of the melted matter.  The summit of the great volcano is a rounded hill, but not entirely  conic. From the angles of altitude which I took at different  distances, its absolute elevation did not appear to exceed three  hundred toises. The neighbouring hills, and those of Alegranza and  Isla Clara, were scarcely above one hundred or one hundred and  twenty toises. We may be surprised at the small elevation of these  summits, which, viewed from the sea, wear so majestic a form; but  nothing is more uncertain than our judgment on the greatness of  angles, which are subtended by objects close to the horizon. From  illusions of this sort it arose, that before the measures of  Messrs. de Churruca and Galleano, at Cape Pilar, navigators  considered the mountains of the straits of Magellan, and those of  Terra del Fuego, to be extremely elevated.    The island of Lancerota bore formerly the name of Titeroigotra. On  the arrival of the Spaniards, its inhabitants were distinguished  from the other Canarians by marks of greater civilization. Their  houses were built with freestone, while the Guanches of Teneriffe  dwelt in caverns. At Lancerota, a very singular custom prevailed at  that time, of which we find no example except among the people of  Thibet. A woman had several husbands, who alternately enjoyed the  prerogatives due to the head of a family. A husband was considered  as such only during a lunar revolution, and whilst his rights were  exercised by others, he remained classed among the household  domestics. In the fifteenth century the island of Lancerota  contained two small distinct states, divided by a wall; a kind of  monument which outlives national enmities, and which we find in  Scotland, in China, and Peru.    We were forced by the winds to pass between the islands of  Alegranza and Montana Clara, and as none on board the sloop had  sailed through this passage, we were obliged to be continually  sounding. We found from twenty-five to thirty-two fathoms. The lead  brought up an organic substance of so singular a structure that we  were for a long time doubtful whether it was a zoophyte or a kind  of seaweed. The stem, of a brownish colour and three inches long,  has circular leaves with lobes, and indented at the edges. The  colour of these leaves is a pale green, and they are membranous and  streaked like those of the adiantums and Gingko biloba. Their  surface is covered with stiff whitish hairs; before their opening  they are concave, and enveloped one in the other. We observed no  mark of spontaneous motion, no sign of irritability, not even on  the application of galvanic electricity. The stem is not woody, but  almost of a horny substance, like the stem of the Gorgons. Azote  and phosphorus having been abundantly found in several cryptogamous  plants, an appeal to chemistry would be useless to determine  whether this organized substance belonged to the animal or  vegetable kingdom. Its great analogy to several sea-plants, with  adiantum leaves, especially the genus caulerpa of M. Lamoureux, of  which the Fucus proliter of Forskael is one of the numerous  species, engaged us to rank it provisionally among the sea-wracks,  and give it the name of Fucus vitifolius. The bristles which cover  this plant are found in several other fuci.* (* Fucus  lycopodioides, and F. hirsutus.) The leaf, examined with a  microscope at the instant we drew it up from the water, did not  present, it is true, those conglobate glands, or those opaque  points, which the parts of fructification in the genera of ulva and  fucus contain; but how often do we find seaweeds in such a state  that we cannot yet distinguish any trace of seeds in their  transparent parenchyma.    The vine-leaved fucus presents a physiological phenomenon of the  greatest interest. Fixed to a piece of madrepore, this seaweed  vegetates at the bottom of the ocean, at the depth of 192 feet,  notwithstanding which we found its leaves as green as those of our  grasses. According to the experiments of Bouguer, light is weakened  after a passage of 180 feet in the ratio of 1 to 1477.8. The  seaweed of Alegranza consequently presents a new example of plants  which vegetate in great obscurity without becoming white. Several  germs, enveloped in the bulbs of the lily tribes, the embryo of the  malvaceae, of the rhamnoides, of the pistacea, the viscum, and the  citrus, the branches of some subterraneous plants; in short,  vegetables transported into mines, where the ambient air contains  hydrogen or a great quantity of azote, become green without light.  From these facts we are inclined to admit that it is not  exclusively by the influence of the solar rays that this carburet  of hydrogen is formed in the organs of plants, the presence of  which makes the parenchyma appear of a lighter or darker green,  according as the carbon predominates in the mixture.    Mr. Turner, who has so well made known the family of the seaweeds,  as well as many other celebrated botanists, are of opinion that  most of the fuci which we gather on the surface of the ocean, and  which, from the 23rd to the 35th degree of latitude and 32nd of  longitude, appear to the mariner like a vast inundated meadow, grow  primitively at the bottom of the ocean, and float only in their  ripened state, when torn up by the motion of the waves. If this  opinion be well founded, we must agree that the family of seaweeds  offers formidable difficulties to naturalists, who persist in  thinking that absence of light always produces whiteness; for how  can we admit that so many species of ulvaceae and dictyoteae, with  stems and green leaves, which float on the ocean, have vegetated on  rocks near the surface of the water?    From some notions which the captain of the Pizarro had collected in  an old Portuguese itinerary, he thought himself opposite to a small  fort, situated north of Teguisa, the capital of the island of  Lancerota. Mistaking a rock of basalt for a castle, he saluted it  by hoisting the Spanish flag, and sent a boat with an officer to  inquire of the commandant whether any English vessels were cruising  in the roads. We were not a little surprised to learn that the land  which we had considered as a prolongation of the coast of  Lancerota, was the small island of Graciosa, and that for several  leagues there was not an"]]]
