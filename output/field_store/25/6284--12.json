But until the master hand is satisfied of all the  requisites for producing fine goods, he should confine production to the  best his facilities will make in the most perfect, uniform manner.    Samples of fine goods are shown all over the country every day, and were  consumers or merchants sure that the product would be the same, there  would be much less difficulty in introducing and more homemade goods  used where now importations are depended upon. The Stevens crash mills  import raw flax because it is to be had according to sample, perfectly  classified, and saves the employment of skilled labor to assort and  classify, and of purchasing a great deal not wanted. The manufacturers  of edge tools and knives use imported steel because it is warranted and  the warrant proves good, while the uncertainty of American steel is such  that a knife will often crack in tempering and cause the loss of labor  worth ten times the difference in the price of the steel. Samples of  alpacas and other dress goods are shown in our jobbing houses fully  equal to any imported goods, but the goods when received are quite often  of various grades and imperfections of character.    The imperfect or second quality productions find sale, but at a much  lower price, and are to be found at second rate places, the  imperfections slight and the goods perhaps generally quite as  serviceable, but not absolutely so, and first class houses, catering to  those who pay highest prices, cannot afford to have any other house  carry better articles than they do. The use of perfect appliances and  the best material and the employment of the highest skill are not yet  the first step and an absolute necessity, as it should be, in America.  The supply of such machinery, material, and labor can be had if those  who propose to enter the production of first class articles will insist  upon it, and if such supplies are appreciated by the payment of their  higher value. The American standard of production is not the highest,  and it can be materially elevated, and while, as at present, too many  common articles are supplied, the leading manufacturers should turn to  producing finer, the finest, and in smaller quantities, to take the  place of many articles now imported, and to supply the new market which  such productions will always create in any country.           *       *       *       *       *                              =The Wool Product of the World.=    From an interesting article on the wool trade of the Pacific coast,  published in a recent number of the San Francisco _Journal of Commerce_,  we learn that the number of sheep in the world is now estimated at from  four hundred and eighty-four to six hundred millions, of which the  United States has about 36,000,000, and Great Britain the same number.  From 1801 to 1875 the wool clip of Great Britain and Ireland increased  from 94,000,000 to 325,000,000 pounds. That of France has increased  almost as rapidly, though the wool is finer, as a rule, and hence the  superiority of French cloths. Australia produces nearly as much wool as  the parent country--Great Britain. The United States product increased  from very little at the beginning of the century to about 200,000,000  pounds at the present time. Of this California has produced about one  fourth, and the Pacific coast as a whole almost one third. If the ratio  of growth shown in the past prevails in the future, the day is not far  distant when the Pacific coast will produce at least one half the wool  produced in the United States, as not only California and Oregon, but  also Washington, Idaho, Montana, Utah, and New Mexico are well adapted  to its production. The wool clip of Australia is about 284,000,000  pounds; that of Buenos Ayres and the river Plata, 222,500,000 pounds;  other countries not previously given, 463,000,000 pounds. The total clip  of the world last year was about 1,497,500,000 pounds, worth  $150,000,000. This when scoured would yield about 852,000,000 pounds of  clean wool.           *       *       *       *       *                                   =Street Main Joints.=    At the annual meeting of the New England Association of Gas Engineers,  Mr. Thomas, of Williamsburg, made the following remarks on this subject:  \"In my early experience with the Williamsburg Gaslight Company, with  which I became connected in the year 1854, I found pretty nearly all the  street mains that were laid were connected with cement joints. While  there is no doubt in my own mind that a joint can be made perfectly  tight with cement, I much prefer the lead joint. Another thing to be  taken into consideration to keep tight joints is that the mains should  be laid a sufficient depth under the surface to protect them from the  action of severe frosts. A great many of the mains were not more than 18  inches or 2 feet below the surface of the streets, and at this depth in  our climate it is a matter of impossibility to keep joints tight, as the  action of the frost in winter will displace the mains and cause the  joints to leak. From the bad manner in which our mains were laid, and  the cement joints leaking so much, we could not afford to turn gas on  during the day. Had we done so we should not have had any to supply the  city at night, and we were thus compelled to shut off the gas just as  soon as there was any apology for daylight, and keep it shut off as late  as possible in the evening.    \"With the most careful working in this manner, for a period of nine or  twelve months, our losses from leakage amounted to about 52 to 55 per  cent of the gas manufactured. A great part of this loss was caused by  the cement joints leaking, and also a part due to the fact that the  mains were not at sufficient depth under the surface to protect them  from the action of the frost. As soon as we possibly could I went over  the whole of our mains (there was about 17 miles in all), stripping  them, cutting out the cement, and rejointing them with lead. In one  season we got the loss from leakage down to 20 per cent, and this with  the gas turned on during the 24 hours of the day.    \"One great objection to cement joints is the rigidity of them; in cases  where pipes have been disturbed by other excavations and settled, I  found in all cases that the mains were broken. In a leading main from  our old works, with cement joints, the main, a 10-inch one, was broken  entirely off and fractured lengthwise besides, by the upheaval of the  ground from frost. In some of the same mains that we had rejointed with  lead the mains were drawn apart, drawing the lead out, but with very  little loss of gas, as the gasket being driven in tight prevented any  great leakage. In cases of this kind the lead was easily driven back,  and the joint made perfectly tight again. I have never in our city put  in any street mains that I have not used lead in the joints, and in  laying mains we always make them gas tight with the gasket used.    \"At the present time we have over 90 miles of street mains laid, and  outside of our loss from street lamps (we get paid for three foot  burners and they average about 3-1/4 foot) our loss from leakage will not  exceed 6 per cent. We have suffered severe loss of gas from sewering in  our city. In some cases where there are railroad tracks in the streets,  the sewers have been run on both sides of the street, alongside and  parallel with our pipes; these excavations are much deeper than our  mains lie, and the earth is always filled in loosely and left to settle.    \"In cases of this kind, whole blocks of mains were dragged down, the  pipe broken, and the joints partially pulled apart; at the same time the  leakage from the joints was not so great, the gasket preventing the  leakage. In laying street mains, what you want particularly to attend  to, and especially in the East here, where you have colder weather than  we have (we have not seen much winter until we came on here), is to get  them down under the surface a sufficient depth to protect them from the  frost. With us the least depth is 2 feet 9 inches under the surface of  the street, and I am confident, could our mains remain in the ground as  we put them down, our loss from leakage by them would be very small  indeed. While, as I stated in the beginning, I have no doubt that a  cement joint can be made tight, I can see no benefit in using cement for  the purpose, as I consider lead far superior in accommodating itself to  any upheaval or settling of the earth where the mains are laid down.\"           *       *       *       *       *                                =Successful Shad Hatching.=    Professor J. W. Milner, who has charge of the shad hatching operations  under the direction of the United States Fish Commissioner, Professor  Baird, is now engaged in the preparation of the report of the work for  the season just completed. Speaking of the work on the Atlantic  seaboard, and the distribution of young fish, the report says that at  the Salmon Creek Station, on Albemarle Sound, they obtained 12,730,000  eggs, and turned out 3,000,000 young fish. At the Havre de Grace Station  12,230,000 eggs were obtained, and 9,575,000 young fish were turned out.  About 6,000,000 young shad have been distributed in the rivers emptying  into the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico during the season. The distribution  of shad during the past season has been carried on on a much larger  scale than in any previous year, and with great success. The restocking  of the rivers of the Atlantic is only the work of a few years.           *       *       *       *       *                                =New Use for Lemon Verbena.=    The well known fragrant garden favorite, the sweet-scented or lemon  verbena (_Lippia citriodora_),"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4330"],[0,"Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia — Complete (#13)"],[1,"the crevices of which they had driven  their prey. Seven fine bream were taken, the whole of which they insisted  on giving to our men, although I am not aware that any of themselves had  broken their fast that day. They soon, however, procured a quantity of  muscles, with which they sat down very contentedly at a fire. My  barometrical admeasurement gave the cataract an elevation of 680 feet  above the level of the sea; and my observations placed it in east  longitude 148 degrees 3 minutes and in latitude 31 degrees 50 minutes  south.    It became an object with us to gain the right bank of the Macquarie as  soon as possible; for it was evident that the country to the southward of  it was much more swampy than it was to the north: but for some distance  below the cataract, we found it impossible to effect our purpose. The  rocks composing the bed of the river at the cataract, which are of trapp  formation, disappeared at about eight miles below it, when the river  immediately assumed another character. Its banks became of equal height,  which had not before been the case, and averaged from fifteen to eighteen  feet. They were composed entirely of alluvial soil, and were higher than  the highest flood-marks. Its waters appeared to be turbid and deep, and  its bed was a mixture of sand and clay. The casuarina, which had so often  been admired by us, entirely disappeared and the channel in many places  became so narrow as to be completely arched over by gum-trees.    A TRIBE OF NATIVES.    On the 16th, we fell in with a numerous tribe of natives who joined our  train after the very necessary ceremonies of an introduction had passed,  and when added to those who still accompanied us, amounted to fifty-three.  On this occasion I was riding somewhat in front of the party, when I came  upon them. They were very different in appearance from those whom we had  surprised at the river; and from the manner in which I was received, I was  led to infer that they had been informed of our arrival, and had  purposely assembled to meet us. I was saluted by an old man, who had  stationed himself in front of his tribe, and who was their chief. Behind  him the young men stood in a line, and behind them the warriors were  seated on the ground.    CONDUCT OF THE NATIVES.    I had a young native with me who had attached himself to our party, and  who, from his extreme good nature and superior intelligence, was  considered by us as a first-rate kind of fellow. He explained who and what  we were, and I was glad to observe that the old chief seemed perfectly  reconciled to my presence, although he cast many an anxious glance at the  long train of animals that were approaching. The warriors, I remarked,  never lifted their eyes from the ground. They were hideously painted with  red and yellow ochre, and had their weapons at their sides, while their  countenances were fixed, sullen, and determined. In order to overcome this  mood, I rode up to them, and, taking a spear from the nearest, gave him  my gun to examine; a mark of confidence that was not lost upon them, for  they immediately relaxed from their gravity, and as soon as my party  arrived, rose up and followed us. That which appeared most to excite their  surprise, was the motion of the wheels of the boat carriage. The young  native whom I have noticed above, acted as interpreter, and, by his  facetious manner, contrived to keep the whole of us in a fit of laughter  as we moved along. He had been named Botheri by some stockman.      In consequence of our wish to cross the river, we kept near it, and  experienced considerable delay from the frequent marshes that opposed  themselves to our progress. In one of these we saw a number of ibises and  spoonbills; and the natives succeeded in killing two or three snakes. Our  view to the westward was extremely limited; but to the eastward the  country appeared in some places to expand into plains.    CROSSING OF THE RIVER.    After travelling some miles down the banks of the river, finding that they  still retained their steep character, we turned back to a place which Mr.  Hume had observed, and at which he thought we might, with some little  trouble, cross to the opposite side. And, however objectionable the  attempt was, we found ourselves obliged to make it. We descended,  therefore, into the channel of the river, and unloaded the animals and  boat-carriage. In order to facilitate the ascent of the right bank, some  of the men were directed to cut steps up it. I was amused to see the  natives voluntarily assist them; and was surprised when they took up bags  of flour weighing 100 pounds each, and carried them across the river. We  were not long in getting the whole of the stores over. The boat was then  hoisted on the shoulders of the strongest, and deposited on the top of the  opposite bank; and ropes being afterwards attached to the carriage, it was  soon drawn up to a place of safety. The natives worked as hard as our own  people, and that, too, with a cheerfulness for which I was altogether  unprepared, and which is certainly foreign to their natural habits. We  pitched our tents as soon as we had effected the passage of the river;  after which, the men went to bathe, and blacks and whites were mingled  promiscuously in the stream. I did not observe that the former differed in  any respect from the natives who frequent the located districts. They were  generally clean limbed and stout, and some of the young men had pleasing  intelligent countenances. They lacerate their bodies, inflicting deep  wounds to raise the flesh, and extract the front teeth like the Bathurst  tribes; and their weapons are precisely the same. They are certainly a  merry people, and sit up laughing and talking more than half the night.    BAROMETER BROKEN.    During the removal of the stores my barometer was unfortunately broken,  and I had often, in the subsequent stages of the journey, occasion to  regret the accident. I apprehend that the corks in the instrument, placed  to steady the tube, are too distant from each other in most cases; and  indeed I fear that barometers as at present constructed, will seldom be  carried with safety in overland expeditions.    DESERTED BY THE NATIVES.    Nine only of the natives accompanied us on the morning succeeding the day  in which we crossed the river. Botheri was, however, at the head of them;  and, as we journeyed along, he informed me that he had been promised a  wife on his return from acting as our guide, by the chief of the last  tribe. The excessive heat of the weather obliged us to shorten our  journey, and we encamped about noon in some scrub after having traversed a  level country for about eleven miles.    Several considerable plains were noticed to our right, stretching east and  west, which were generally rich in point of soil; but we passed through  much brushy land during the day. It was lamentable to see the state of  vegetation upon the plains from want of moisture. Although the country  had assumed a level character, and was more open than on the higher  branches of the Macquarie, the small freestone elevations, backing the  alluvial tracts near the river, still continued upon our right, though  much diminished in height, and at a great distance from the banks. They  seemed to be covered with cypresses and beef-wood, but dwarf-box and the  acacia pendula prevailed along the plains; while flooded-gum alone  occupied the lands in the immediate neighbourhood of the stream, which was  evidently fast diminishing, both in volume and rapidity; its bed, however,  still continuing to be a mixture of sand and clay.    The cattle found such poor feed around the camp that they strayed away in  search of better during the night. On such an occasion Botheri and his  fraternity would have been of real service; but he had decamped at an  early hour, and had carried off an axe, a tomahawk, and some bacon,  although I had made him several presents. I was not at all surprised at  this piece of roguery, since cunning is the natural attribute of a savage;  but I was provoked at their running away at a moment when I so much  required their assistance.    Left to ourselves, I found Mr. Hume of the most essential service in  tracking the animals, and to his perseverance we were indebted for their  speedy recovery, They had managed to find tolerable feed near a serpentine  sheet of water, which Mr. Hume thought it would be advisable to examine.  We directed our course to it as soon as the cattle were loaded, moving  through bush, and found it to be a very considerable creek that receives a  part of the superfluous waters of the Macquarie, and distributes them,  most probably, over the level country to the north. It was much wider than  the river, being from fifty to sixty yards across, and is resorted to by  the natives, who procure muscles from its bed in great abundance. We were  obliged to traverse its eastern bank to its junction with the river, at  which it fortunately happened to be dry. We had, however, to cut roads  down both its banks before we could cross it; and, consequently, made but  a short day's journey. The soil passed over was inferior to the generality  of soil near the river, but we encamped on a tongue of land on which both  the flooded-gum and the grass were of luxuriant height. We found a  quantity of a substance like pipe-clay in the bed of the river, similar to  that mentioned by Mr. Oxley.    GREAT HEAT.    The heat, which had been excessive at Wellington Valley, increased upon us  as we advanced into the interior. The thermometer was seldom under 114  degrees at noon, and rose still higher at 2 p.m. We had no dews at night,  and consequently the range of the instrument was trifling in the  twenty-four hours. The country looked bare and scorched, and the plains  over which we journeyed had large fissures traversing them, so that the  earth may literally be said to have gasped for moisture."]]]
