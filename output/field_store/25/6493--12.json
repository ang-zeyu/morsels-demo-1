Does any one in his senses believe that an  ape-human animal developed one-third of the normal human brain in  375,000 or 750,000 years, when it took 59,250,000 years to develop  two-thirds of the brain? If one-third of the normal brain developed in  the last 750,000 years, the rate of development must have been 39.5  times as great as in the preceding 59,250,000 years. If one-third  developed in the last 375,000 years, the rate of development must have  been 78 times as rapid as in the preceding 59,625,000 years. This is  incredible. If life began 500,000,000 years ago, and one-third the  brain developed in the last 750,000 years, the rate must have been 332  times as rapid as in the preceding 499,250,000 years; and 666 times as  rapid in 375,000 years as in the preceding 499,625,000 years. All  these guesses are clearly impossible.    But the agile evolutionist may try to escape the death sentence of  mathematics and the condemnation of reason, by saying that the brain  developed more rapidly than the rest of the body. But he is estopped  from that claim, by the statement of this same Prof. R. S. Lull: \"The  brain, especially the type of brain found in the higher human races,  must have been _very_ slow of development.\" If so, the pithecanthropus  must have lived more than 20,000,000 years ago! So swiftly does  inexorable mathematics upset this reckless theory.    This calculation has been made upon the basis of the estimate of  60,000,000 years since life began, taken from Prof. H. H. Newman in  \"Readings in Evolution,\" p. 68.  But, seeing that even this great  estimate of the period of life is not sufficient for evolution, in a  private letter to the writer, Prof. Newman raises his guess to  500,000,000 years. In that case, the pithecanthropus must have lived  one-third of 500,000,000, or 166,666,666 years ago.  And, if we are  reckless enough to admit the \"moderate estimate\" of 1,000,000,000  years, gravely suggested by Prof. Russell, of Princeton University, it  must have lived 333,333,333 years ago. These reckless estimates seem  removed, by the whole diameter of reason, from even a respectable  guess. Every new guess seems to make their case more hopeless. And any  guess that they can make, out of harmony with the Scripture statement,  can be disproved by cold mathematics. In like manner, if the Piltdown  man had the estimated brain capacity of 1070 c.c., instead of the  normal 1500 c.c., this fabricated creature must have lived about  17,200,000 years ago, if life began 60,000,000 years ago; and  143,333,333 years ago, if life began 500,000,000 years ago; (c.c. =  cubic centimeters).    Prof. Schaaffhausen, the discoverer, estimated the capacity of the  Neanderthal man at 1033 c.c. Then he must have lived 18,680,000 years  ago, if we accept the 60,000,000 year period; and 311,333,333 years  ago, if we accept Prof. Russell's guess of 1,000,000,000 years.    And in all these long ages, fragments of only four skeletons of very  doubtful character have been found, and upon this flimsy proof, the  youth of our land are expected by self-styled \"scientists\" to believe  it, even though it leads them into infidelity and atheism, and causes  the loss of their souls.    Let us take another view. Let us assume that the pithecanthropus  really lived 750,000 years ago, as claimed, which is 1.25% of  60,000,000 years. Therefore, its brain capacity then should have been  98.75% normal, or 1481.25 c.c. or 18.75 c.c. less than the normal 1500  c.c. Also 750,000 years is only .15% of 500,000,000 years; hence in  that case, the brain should have been 99.85% normal, or 1497.75  c.c. In either case, the intelligence must have excelled that of many  nations and races. All these calculations prove positively that no  such creatures as these four alleged ape-men ever could have lived in  the age assigned to them; or, if so, that none could have had, at that  time, the low brain capacity claimed. Q. E. D.    Is it not plain that for the last 2,000,000 years out of 60,000,000  years, the developing human race must have been over 29/30 or 96 2/3%  normal, in intelligence, morality, and spirituality? This is greater  than that of many peoples today. With this high degree of  intelligence, man was capable of great inventions and discoveries.  Not a single monument remains. We would expect some great monument  like the pyramids of Egypt. A race with such advancement, for so many  years would have been able to reach the heights of invention,  discovery, and learning of the present age. Not a whit of evidence  comes down to us.    If 2,000,000 years ago, man had the same skull capacity as the ape,  600 c.c., he has gained 900 c.c. in 2,000,000 years, and only 600  c.c. in 58,000,000 years. His improvement in the last 2,000,000 years,  must have been 43.5 times as rapid as during the preceding 58,000,000  years; or 373.5 times as rapid as during the preceding 498,000,000  years. How was that possible?        17. EIGHT IMPASSABLE GULFS      The evolution theory, stretching from matter to man, is impossible,  because of many impassable gulfs. Some of these impassable gulfs  are:--    1. Between the living and non-living or dead matter;  2. Between the vegetable and the animal kingdoms;  3. Between the invertebrates and the vertebrates;  4. Between marine animals and amphibians;  5. Between amphibians and reptiles;  6. Between reptiles and birds;  7. Between reptiles and mammals;  8. Between mammals and the human body;  9. Between soulless simians and the soul of man, bearing the image of     God.    There is not a scrap of evidence that these gulfs have ever been  crossed. In the scheme, the material must become living by spontaneous  generation; some plants must become invertebrate animals; some  invertebrates must become vertebrates; some marine animals must become  amphibians; some amphibians must become reptiles; some reptiles must  become mammals; some mammals must become humans; some senseless,  soulless simians must acquire a soul and become spiritual enough to  bear the image of God.    There is no convincing proof that any of these great and incredible  advances were ever made. If we estimate the probability of each  transmutation at 10%, which is too high, then the probability that all  these changes up to man were made is .1 raised to the 8th  power, .00000001.  Therefore, there is not more than one chance out of  100,000,000 that these 8 changes were made. And if we estimate the  probability of each great change at .001, which is doubtless still too  high, the probability that man took these 8 great steps of evolution  is one out of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or a million,  million, million, million. If we estimate the probability of each  change even at 60%, which is far above all reason, the probability of  man's evolution through these 8 changes is only 1 out of 60, which  marks an improbability close to an impossibility. The highest estimate  we can reasonably make, destroys all hope that man or even any other  species could have come by evolution. Few persons realize how  improbable an event is made which depends upon a number of  possibilities or even probabilities, until calculated by the rule of  Compound Mathematical Probability.    Imagine the Copernican or the gravitation theory depending on a number  of possibilities or probabilities! No true theory is built on such an  uncertain foundation.    But, if the evolutionists could prove that 7 out of 8 of the great  changes certainly did occur, but failed to prove the 8th, they would  lose their case. But they have failed in all. They must prove all to  win. There is not the slightest probability that any one of these  changes ever occurred. Hence, the evolution of man from this long line  of alleged ancestors is an absolute impossibility. Q. E. D.    None of these changes is _now_ occurring. There is no spontaneous  generation now. Darwin himself said that spontaneous generation in the  past was \"absolutely inconceivable.\"  No reptiles are becoming  mammals, none becoming birds, no apes or monkeys are becoming men. No  species is now transmuted into another, no new species arises. Is not  this proof enough that such great changes never occurred?    Moreover, if dead matter caused one living germ, why did it not cause  more? If some reptiles developed into mammals, and birds, why not all?  If one family of simians became human, why not others? Why not at  least become anthropoids? Why did all other members of the simian  family not become at least part human?  Why have they remained  stationary?    Besides, we have with us yet the invertebrates that have not yet  become vertebrates; marine animals that have not become amphibians;  amphibians that have not become reptiles; reptiles that have become  neither mammals nor birds, and a multitude of simians that have not  become human, and are not moving toward man either in bodily form or  intelligence or spirituality. We have the one-celled amoeba, the  microscopic animals, and the lowest forms of animal life. If the great  law of progress and advancement to higher forms has prevailed for so  many million years, there should be none but the highest species. All  should have reached the status of human beings and there should be  none of the lower forms of life which are so abundant. Changes so  radical and vast, stretching through so many ages, would require  millions of connecting links. If reptiles became hairy mammals, we  would expect fossils of thousands, if not millions, in the transition  state. If some reptiles were changed into the 12,000 species of birds,  we would expect countless fossils, part reptile, part bird. Only one  is claimed, the arch√¶opteryx (ancient bird), two specimens of which  are known, which had a feathered tail, and which is only a slight  modification of other birds. Many other birds have departed farther  from the normal. There should be millions of fossils"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#13)"],[1,"mechanical, we may be  sure that external pressure is brought to bear to reach an external end.    2. Since in reality there is nothing to which growth is relative save  more growth, there is nothing to which education is subordinate save  more education. It is a commonplace to say that education should not  cease when one leaves school. The point of this commonplace is that the  purpose of school education is to insure the continuance of education by  organizing the powers that insure growth. The inclination to learn from  life itself and to make the conditions of life such that all will learn  in the process of living is the finest product of schooling.    When we abandon the attempt to define immaturity by means of fixed  comparison with adult accomplishments, we are compelled to give up  thinking of it as denoting lack of desired traits. Abandoning this  notion, we are also forced to surrender our habit of thinking of  instruction as a method of supplying this lack by pouring knowledge into  a mental and moral hole which awaits filling. Since life means growth,  a living creature lives as truly and positively at one stage as at  another, with the same intrinsic fullness and the same absolute claims.  Hence education means the enterprise of supplying the conditions which  insure growth, or adequacy of life, irrespective of age. We first look  with impatience upon immaturity, regarding it as something to be got  over as rapidly as possible. Then the adult formed by such educative  methods looks back with impatient regret upon childhood and youth as a  scene of lost opportunities and wasted powers. This ironical situation  will endure till it is recognized that living has its own intrinsic  quality and that the business of education is with that quality.  Realization that life is growth protects us from that so-called  idealizing of childhood which in effect is nothing but lazy indulgence.  Life is not to be identified with every superficial act and interest.  Even though it is not always easy to tell whether what appears to be  mere surface fooling is a sign of some nascent as yet untrained power,  we must remember that manifestations are not to be accepted as ends in  themselves. They are signs of possible growth. They are to be turned  into means of development, of carrying power forward, not indulged or  cultivated for their own sake. Excessive attention to surface phenomena  (even in the way of rebuke as well as of encouragement) may lead to  their fixation and thus to arrested development. What impulses are  moving toward, not what they have been, is the important thing for  parent and teacher. The true principle of respect for immaturity cannot  be better put than in the words of Emerson: \"Respect the child. Be not  too much his parent. Trespass not on his solitude. But I hear the outcry  which replies to this suggestion: Would you verily throw up the reins  of public and private discipline; would you leave the young child to  the mad career of his own passions and whimsies, and call this anarchy  a respect for the child's nature? I answer,--Respect the child, respect  him to the end, but also respect yourself.... The two points in a boy's  training are, to keep his naturel and train off all but that; to keep  his naturel, but stop off his uproar, fooling, and horseplay; keep  his nature and arm it with knowledge in the very direction in which it  points.\" And as Emerson goes on to show this reverence for childhood  and youth instead of opening up an easy and easy-going path to the  instructors, \"involves at once, immense claims on the time, the thought,  on the life of the teacher. It requires time, use, insight, event, all  the great lessons and assistances of God; and only to think of using it  implies character and profoundness.\"    Summary. Power to grow depends upon need for others and plasticity.  Both of these conditions are at their height in childhood and youth.  Plasticity or the power to learn from experience means the formation of  habits. Habits give control over the environment, power to utilize  it for human purposes. Habits take the form both of habituation, or  a general and persistent balance of organic activities with the  surroundings, and of active capacities to readjust activity to meet new  conditions. The former furnishes the background of growth; the latter  constitute growing. Active habits involve thought, invention, and  initiative in applying capacities to new aims. They are opposed  to routine which marks an arrest of growth. Since growth is the  characteristic of life, education is all one with growing; it has no  end beyond itself. The criterion of the value of school education is the  extent in which it creates a desire for continued growth and supplies  means for making the desire effective in fact.    1 Intimations of its significance are found in a number of writers, but  John Fiske, in his Excursions of an Evolutionist, is accredited with its  first systematic exposition.    2 This conception is, of course, a logical correlate of the conceptions  of the external relation of stimulus and response, considered in  the last chapter, and of the negative conceptions of immaturity and  plasticity noted in this chapter.          Chapter Five: Preparation, Unfolding, and Formal Discipline    1. Education as Preparation. We have laid it down that the educative  process is a continuous process of growth, having as its aim at every  stage an added capacity of growth. This conception contrasts sharply  with other ideas which have influenced practice. By making the contrast  explicit, the meaning of the conception will be brought more clearly to  light. The first contrast is with the idea that education is a process  of preparation or getting ready. What is to be prepared for is, of  course, the responsibilities and privileges of adult life. Children are  not regarded as social members in full and regular standing. They are  looked upon as candidates; they are placed on the waiting list. The  conception is only carried a little farther when the life of adults  is considered as not having meaning on its own account, but as a  preparatory probation for \"another life.\" The idea is but another form  of the notion of the negative and privative character of growth already  criticized; hence we shall not repeat the criticisms, but pass on to the  evil consequences which flow from putting education on this basis.  In the first place, it involves loss of impetus. Motive power is not  utilized. Children proverbially live in the present; that is not only  a fact not to be evaded, but it is an excellence. The future just as  future lacks urgency and body. To get ready for something, one knows not  what nor why, is to throw away the leverage that exists, and to seek for  motive power in a vague chance. Under such circumstances, there is, in  the second place, a premium put on shilly-shallying and procrastination.  The future prepared for is a long way off; plenty of time will intervene  before it becomes a present. Why be in a hurry about getting ready for  it? The temptation to postpone is much increased because the present  offers so many wonderful opportunities and proffers such invitations to  adventure. Naturally attention and energy go to them; education accrues  naturally as an outcome, but a lesser education than if the full stress  of effort had been put upon making conditions as educative as possible.  A third undesirable result is the substitution of a conventional average  standard of expectation and requirement for a standard which concerns  the specific powers of the individual under instruction. For a severe  and definite judgment based upon the strong and weak points of the  individual is substituted a vague and wavering opinion concerning what  youth may be expected, upon the average, to become in some more or less  remote future; say, at the end of the year, when promotions are to take  place, or by the time they are ready to go to college or to enter  upon what, in contrast with the probationary stage, is regarded as the  serious business of life. It is impossible to overestimate the loss  which results from the deflection of attention from the strategic point  to a comparatively unproductive point. It fails most just where it  thinks it is succeeding--in getting a preparation for the future.    Finally, the principle of preparation makes necessary recourse on a  large scale to the use of adventitious motives of pleasure and pain. The  future having no stimulating and directing power when severed from the  possibilities of the present, something must be hitched on to it to make  it work. Promises of reward and threats of pain are employed. Healthy  work, done for present reasons and as a factor in living, is largely  unconscious. The stimulus resides in the situation with which one is  actually confronted. But when this situation is ignored, pupils have to  be told that if they do not follow the prescribed course penalties will  accrue; while if they do, they may expect, some time in the future,  rewards for their present sacrifices. Everybody knows how largely  systems of punishment have had to be resorted to by educational systems  which neglect present possibilities in behalf of preparation for a  future. Then, in disgust with the harshness and impotency of this  method, the pendulum swings to the opposite extreme, and the dose of  information required against some later day is sugar-coated, so that  pupils may be fooled into taking something which they do not care for.    It is not of course a question whether education should prepare for the  future. If education is growth, it must progressively realize present  possibilities, and thus make individuals better fitted to cope with  later requirements. Growing is not something which is completed in odd  moments; it is a continuous leading into the future. If the environment,  in school and out, supplies conditions"]]]
