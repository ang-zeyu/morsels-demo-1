Very hard gales, with some heavy showers of  Rain, the most part of these 24 Hours, which brought us under our two  Courses, Broke one of our Main Topmast phuttock Plates, washed overboard  a small Boat belonging to the Boatswain, and drowned between 3 and 4  Dozen of our Poultry, which was worst of all.

P.M.  got up the spare Mainsail to dry, it being Wet by the Water getting into  the Sail room, occasioned by the Ship being very Leakey in her upper  works. At 5 a.m. loosed 2 Reefs out of each Topsail, and saw the Land,  which we judged to be Cape Finister and Cape Ortugal.

At Noon, Cape Finister South by East, distant 4 leagues;  latitude observed 43 degrees 4 minutes, therefore Cape Finister must lay  in latitude 42 degrees 53 minutes North.* (* This is correct.) Wind  Westerly, North-West, Calm.    Tuesday, 6th. Moderate breezes and Clear weather these 24 Hours. A.M.  found the Variation by the Mean of 5 Azimuth to be 21 degrees 40 minutes  West, 3 Degrees more than what it was found Yesterday, which I cannot  account for,* (* Cook, as all other navigators of his time, was unaware  of the deviation of the compass caused by the iron of the ship.) as both  Observations appeared to me to be equally well made. At 10.28 had an  Observation of the sun and moon, which gave the Longitude 9 degrees 40  minutes West from Greenwich. By this Observation Cape Finister must lay  in 8 degrees 52 minutes, and by that made yesterday in 8 degrees 40  minutes. The Mean of the two is 8 degrees 46 minutes West of Greenwich  the Longitude of the Cape,* (* The correct longitude is 9 degrees 15  minutes West.) its latitude being 42 degrees 53 minutes North.
