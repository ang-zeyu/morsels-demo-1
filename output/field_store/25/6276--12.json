Belief in God, Natural and Necessary.=--Dr. Joseph Le Conte,       Professor of Geology and Natural History in the University of       California, and a scientist of world-wide renown, has spoken as       follows:--\"_Theism_, or a belief in God or in gods, or in a       supernatural agency of some kind, controlling the phenomena       around us, is the fundamental basis and condition of all       religion, and is therefore universal, necessary, and intuitive. I       will not, therefore, attempt to bring forward any proof of that       which lies back of all proof, and is already more certain than       anything can be made by any process of reasoning. The ground of       this belief lies in the very nature of man; it is the very       foundation and groundwork of reason. It is this and this only       which gives significance to Nature; without it, neither religion       nor science, nor indeed human life, would be possible. For,       observe what is the characteristic of man in his relation to       external Nature. To the brute, the phenomena of Nature are       nothing but sensuous phenomena; but man, just in proportion as he       uses his human faculties, instinctively ascends from the       phenomena to their cause. This is inevitable by a law of our       nature, but the process of ascent is different for the cultured       and uncultured races. The uncultured man, when a phenomenon       occurs, the cause of which is not immediately perceived, passes       by one step from the sensuous phenomenon to the first cause;       while the cultured, and especially the scientific man, passes       from the sensuous phenomena through a chain of secondary causes       to the first cause. The region of second causes, and this only,       is the domain of science. Science may, in fact, be defined, as       the _study of the modes of operation of the first cause_. It is       evident, therefore, that the recognition of second causes cannot       preclude the idea of the existence of God.... Thus, Theism is       necessary, intuitive, and therefore universal. We cannot get rid       of it if we would. Push it out, as many do, at the front door,       and it comes in again, perhaps unrecognized, at the back door.       Turn it out in its _nobler forms_ as revealed in Scripture, and       it comes in again in its _ignoble forms_, it may be as magnetism,       electricity, or gravity, or some other supposed efficient agent       controlling Nature. In some form, noble or ignoble, it will       become a guest in the human heart. I therefore repeat, _Theism       neither requires nor admits of proof_. But in these latter times,       there is a strong tendency for Theism to take the form of       _Pantheism_, and thereby religious belief is robbed of all its       power over the human heart. It becomes necessary, therefore, for       me to attempt to show, not the existence indeed, but the       _personality of Deity_.... Among a certain class of cultivated       minds, and especially among scientific men, there is a growing       sentiment, sometimes openly expressed, sometimes only vaguely       felt, that what we call God is only a universal, all-pervading       principle animating Nature,--a general principle of evolution--an       unconscious, impersonal life-force under which the whole cosmos       slowly develops. Now, this form of Theism may possibly satisfy       the demands of a purely speculative philosophy, but cannot       satisfy the cravings of the human heart.... The argument for the       personality of Deity is derived from the evidences of intelligent       contrivance and design in Nature, or in the adjustment of parts       for a definite, and an intelligent purpose. It is usually called       '_the argument from design_.' The force of this argument is felt       at once intuitively by all minds, and its effect is irresistible       and overwhelming to every plain, honest mind, unplagued by       metaphysical subtleties.\"--Prof. Joseph Le Conte: in _Religion       and Science_, pp. 12-14.         =4. God in Nature.=--Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most critical       of scientific workers, in writing to his friend Dr. Bentley in       1692, said in reference to the natural universe: \"To make such a       system, with all its motions, required a Cause which understood       and compared together the quantities of matter in the several       bodies of the sun and planets, and the gravitating powers       resulting from them, the several distances of the primary planets       from the sun, and of the secondary ones from Saturn, Jupiter, and       the earth; and the velocities with which these planets could       revolve about those quantities of matter in the central bodies;       and to compare and adjust all these things together in so great a       variety of bodies argues the Cause to be not blind and       fortuitous, but very well skilled in mechanics and geometry.\"         =5. Natural Indications of God's Existence.=--\"It may not be, it       is not likely, that God can be found with microscope and scalpel,       with test-tube or flask, with goniometer or telescope; but with       such tools, the student earnestly working, cannot fail to       recognize a power beyond his vision, yet a power of which the       pulses and the motions are unmistakable. The extent of our solar       system once seemed to man more limited than it does at present;       and the discovery of the most distant of the planetary family was       due to a recognition of an attractive force inexplicable except       on the supposition of the existence of another planet. The       astronomer, tracing known bodies along their orbital paths, could       feel the pull, could see the wire that drew them from a narrower       course; he saw not Neptune as he piled calculations sheet on       sheet; but the existence of that orb was clearly indicated, and       by heeding such indications he sought for it, and it was found.       Theory alone could never have revealed it, though theory was       incomplete, unsatisfactory without it; but the practical search,       instigated by theory, led to the great demonstration. And what is       all science but theory compared to the practical influence of       prayerful reliance on the assistance of an omnipotent, omniscient       power? Disregard not the indications of your science work,--the       trembling of the needle that reveals the magnetic influence; the       instinct within that speaks of a life and a Life-Giver, far       beyond human power of explanation or comprehension. As you sit       beneath the canopied vault, pondering in the silence of night       over the perturbations, the yearnings which the soul cannot       ignore, turn in the direction indicated by those impulses, and       with the penetrating, space-annihilating, time-annulling glass of       prayer and faith, seek the source of that pervading force.\"--The       Author in _Baccalaureate Sermon_, Utah University Quarterly,       Sept., 1895.         =6. Theism; Atheism, etc.=--According to current usage, _Theism_       signifies a belief in God,--the acceptance of one living and       eternal Being who has revealed Himself to man. _Deism_ implies a       professed belief in God, but denies to Deity the power to reveal       Himself, and asserts a disbelief in Christianity; the term is       used in different senses, prominent among which are:--(1) belief       in God as an intelligent and eternal Being, with a denial of all       providential care: (2) belief in God, with denial of a future       state of the soul: (3) as advocated by Kant, denial of a personal       God, while asserting belief in an infinite force, inseparably       associated with matter, and operating as the first great cause.       _Pantheism_ regards matter and mind as one, embracing everything       finite and infinite, and calls this universal existence God. In       its philosophical aspect, pantheism \"has three generic forms with       variations: (1) _one-substance pantheism_ which ascribes to the       universal being the attributes of both mind and matter, thought       and extension, as in Spinoza's system: (2) _materialistic       pantheism_ which ascribes to it only the attributes of matter, as       in the system of Strauss: (3) _idealistic pantheism_ which       ascribes to it only the existence of mind as in Hegel's system.\"       In its doctrinal aspect, pantheism comprises \"the worship of       nature and humanity founded on the doctrine that the entire       phenomenal universe, including man and nature, is the       ever-changing manifestation of God.\" _Polytheism_ is the doctrine       of a plurality of gods, who are usually regarded as       personifications of forces or phenomena of nature. _Monotheism_       is the doctrine that there is but one God. _Atheism_ signifies       disbelief in God, or the denial of God's existence; _dogmatic       atheism_ denies, while _negative atheism_ ignores, the existence       of a God. _Infidelity_ is sometimes used as synonymous with       atheism, though specifically the term signifies a milder form of       unbelief, manifesting itself in scepticism on matters religious,       a disbelief in the religion of the Bible, and of course a       rejection of the doctrines of Christianity. _Agnosticism_ holds       that God is unknown and unknowable; that His existence can       neither be proved nor disproved; it neither affirms nor denies       the existence of a personal God; it is the doctrine of \"We do not       know.\"--_See Standard Dictionary._         =7. Idolatrous Practices in General.=--The soul of man, once       abandoned to depravity, is strongly prone to depart from God and       his institutions. \"Hence,\" says Burder, \"have arisen the altars       and demons of heathen antiquity, their extravagant fictions, and       abominable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#13)"],[1," trail? Are you  Xaltotun?'    Only a strident screech answered him, a screech vibrating with harsh  mockery.    Conan wasted no more breath on his dusky betrayer. Grimly he settled to  the long grind of the hills. He dared not push the horse too hard; the  rest he had allowed it had not been enough to freshen it. He was still  far ahead of his pursuers, but they would cut down that lead steadily.  It was almost a certainty that their horses were fresher than his, for  they had undoubtedly changed mounts at that castle he had passed.    The going grew rougher, the scenery more rugged, steep grassy slopes  pitching up to densely timbered mountainsides. Here, he knew, he might  elude his hunters, but for that hellish bird that squalled incessantly  above him. He could no longer see them in this broken country, but he  was certain that they still followed him, guided unerringly by their  feathered allies. That black shape became like a demoniac incubus,  hounding him through measureless hells. The stones he hurled with a  curse went wide or fell harmless, though in his youth he had felled  hawks on the wing.    The horse was tiring fast. Conan recognized the grim finality of his  position. He sensed an inexorable driving fate behind all this. He could  not escape. He was as much a captive as he had been in the pits of  Belverus. But he was no son of the Orient to yield passively to what  seemed inevitable. If he could not escape, he would at least take some  of his foes into eternity with him. He turned into a wide thicket of  larches that masked a slope, looking for a place to turn at bay.    Then ahead of him there rang a strange, shrill scream, human yet weirdly  timbred. An instant later he had pushed through a screen of branches,  and saw the source of that eldritch cry. In a small glade below him four  soldiers in Nemedian chain-mail were binding a noose about the neck of a  gaunt old woman in peasant garb. A heap of fagots, bound with cord on  the ground near by, showed what her occupation had been when surprised  by these stragglers.    Conan felt slow fury swell his heart as he looked silently down and saw  the ruffians dragging her toward a tree whose low-spreading branches  were obviously intended to act as a gibbet. He had crossed the frontier  an hour ago. He was standing on his own soil, watching the murder of one  of his own subjects. The old woman was struggling with surprising  strength and energy, and as he watched, she lifted her head and voiced  again the strange, weird, far-carrying call he had heard before. It was  echoed as if in mockery by the raven flapping above the trees. The  soldiers laughed roughly, and one struck her in the mouth.    Conan swung from his weary steed and dropped down the face of the rocks,  landing with a clang of mail on the grass. The four men wheeled at the  sound and drew their swords, gaping at the mailed giant who faced them,  sword in hand.    Conan laughed harshly. His eyes were bleak as flint.    'Dogs!' he said without passion and without mercy. 'Do Nemedian jackals  set themselves up as executioners and hang my subjects at will? First  you must take the head of their king. Here I stand, awaiting your lordly  pleasure!'    The soldiers stared at him uncertainly as he strode toward them.    'Who is this madman?' growled a bearded ruffian. 'He wears Nemedian  mail, but speaks with an Aquilonian accent.'    'No matter,' quoth another. 'Cut him down, and then we'll hang the old  hag.'    And so saying he ran at Conan, lifting his sword. But before he could  strike, the king's great blade lashed down, splitting helmet and skull.  The man fell before him, but the others were hardy rogues. They gave  tongue like wolves and surged about the lone figure in the gray mail,  and the clamor and din of steel drowned the cries of the circling raven.    Conan did not shout. His eyes coals of blue fire and his lips smiling  bleakly, he lashed right and left with his two-handed sword. For all his  size he was quick as a cat on his feet, and he was constantly in motion,  presenting a moving target so that thrusts and swings cut empty air  oftener than not. Yet when he struck he was perfectly balanced, and his  blows fell with devastating power. Three of the four were down, dying in  their own blood, and the fourth was bleeding from half a dozen wounds,  stumbling in headlong retreat as he parried frantically, when Conan's  spur caught in the surcoat of one of the fallen men.    The king stumbled, and before he could catch himself the Nemedian, with  the frenzy of desperation, rushed him so savagely that Conan staggered  and fell sprawling over the corpse. The Nemedian croaked in triumph and  sprang forward, lifting his great sword with both hands over his right  shoulder, as he braced his legs wide for the stroke--and then, over the  prostrate king, something huge and hairy shot like a thunderbolt full on  the soldier's breast, and his yelp of triumph changed to a shriek of  death.    Conan, scrambling up, saw the man lying dead with his throat torn out,  and a great gray wolf stood over him, head sunk as it smelled the blood  that formed a pool on the grass.    The king turned as the old woman spoke to him. She stood straight and  tall before him, and in spite of her ragged garb, her features,  clear-cut and aquiline, and her keen black eyes, were not those of a  common peasant woman. She called to the wolf and it trotted to her side  like a great dog and rubbed its giant shoulder against her knee, while  it gazed at Conan with great green lambent eyes. Absently she laid her  hand upon its mighty neck, and so the two stood regarding the king of  Aquilonia. He found their steady gaze disquieting, though there was no  hostility in it.    'Men say King Conan died beneath the stones and dirt when the cliffs  crumbled by Valkia,' she said in a deep, strong, resonant voice.    'So they say,' he growled. He was in no mood for controversy, and he  thought of those armored riders who were pushing nearer every moment.  The raven above him cawed stridently, and he cast an involuntary glare  upward, grinding his teeth in a spasm of nervous irritation.    Up on the ledge the white horse stood with drooping head. The old woman  looked at it, and then at the raven; and then she lifted a strange weird  cry as she had before. As if recognizing the call, the raven wheeled,  suddenly mute, and raced eastward. But before it had got out of sight,  the shadow of mighty wings fell across it. An eagle soared up from the  tangle of trees, and rising above it, swooped and struck the black  messenger to the earth. The strident voice of betrayal was stilled for  ever.    'Crom!' muttered Conan, staring at the old woman. 'Are you a magician,  too?'    'I am Zelata,' she said. 'The people of the valleys call me a witch. Was  that child of the night guiding armed men on your trail?'    'Aye.' She did not seem to think the answer fantastic. 'They cannot be  far behind me.'    'Lead your horse and follow me, King Conan,' she said briefly.    Without comment he mounted the rocks and brought his horse down to the  glade by a circuitous path. As he came he saw the eagle reappear,  dropping lazily down from the sky, and rest an instant on Zelata's  shoulder, spreading its great wings lightly so as not to crush her with  its weight.    Without a word she led the way, the great wolf trotting at her side, the  eagle soaring above her. Through deep thickets and along tortuous ledges  poised over deep ravines she led him, and finally along a narrow  precipice-edged path to a curious dwelling of stone, half hut, half  cavern, beneath a cliff hidden among the gorges and crags. The eagle  flew to the pinnacle of this cliff, and perched there like a motionless  sentinel.    Still silent, Zelata stabled the horse in a near-by cave, with leaves  and grass piled high for provender, and a tiny spring bubbling in the  dim recesses.    In the hut she seated the king on a rude, hide-covered bench, and she  herself sat upon a low stool before the tiny fireplace, while she made a  fire of tamarisk chunks and prepared a frugal meal. The great wolf  drowsed beside her, facing the fire, his huge head sunk on his paws, his  ears twitching in his dreams.    'You do not fear to sit in the hut of a witch?' she asked, breaking her  silence at last.    An impatient shrug of his gray-mailed shoulders was her guest's only  reply. She gave into his hands a wooden dish heaped with dried fruits,  cheese and barley bread, and a great pot of the heady upland beer,  brewed from barley grown in the high valleys.    'I have found the brooding silence of the glens more pleasing than the  babble of city streets,' she said. 'The children of the wild are kinder  than the children of men.' Her hand briefly stroked the ruff of the  sleeping wolf. 'My children were afar from me today, or I had not needed  your sword, my king. They were coming at my call.'    'What grudge had those Nemedian dogs against you?' Conan demanded.    'Skulkers from the invading army straggle all over the countryside, from  the frontier to Tarantia,' she answered. 'The foolish villagers in the  valleys told them that I had a store of gold hidden away, so as to  divert their attentions from their villages. They demanded treasure from  me, and my answers angered them. But neither skulkers nor the men who  pursue you, nor any raven will find you here.'    He shook his head, eating ravenously.    'I'm for Tarantia.'    She shook her head.    'You thrust your head into the dragon's jaws. Best seek refuge abroad.  The heart is gone from your kingdom.'    'What do you mean?' he demanded. 'Battles have been lost before, yet  wars won. A kingdom is not lost by a single defeat.'    'And you will go to Tarantia?'    'Aye. Prospero will be holding it against Amalric.'    'Are you sure?'    'Hell's devils, woman!' he exclaimed wrathfully. 'What else?'    She shook her head. 'I feel that it "]]]
