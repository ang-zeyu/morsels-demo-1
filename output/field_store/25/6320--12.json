[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4658"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 2 (#13)"],[1,"P.M., travelling towards the East, we entered a Bughaz,[FN#4]  or Pass, which follows the course of a wide Fiumara, walled in by steep  and barren hills,the portals of a region too wild even for Badawin. The  torrent-bed narrowed where the turns were abrupt, and the drift of  heavy stones, with a water-mark from six to seven feet    [p.62] high, showed that after rains a violent stream runs from East  and South-East to West and North-West. The fertilising fluid is close  to the surface, evidenced by a spare growth of Acacia, camel-grass, and  at some angles of the bed by the Daum, or Theban palm.[FN#5] I remarked  what was technically called Hufrah, holes dug for water in the sand; and  the guide assured me that somewhere near there is a spring flowing from  the rocks.    After the long and sultry afternoon, beasts of burden began to sink in  numbers. The fresh carcases of asses, ponies, and camels dotted the  wayside: those that had been allowed to die were abandoned to the foul  carrion-birds, the Rakham (vulture), and the yellow Ukab; and all whose  throats had been properly cut, were surrounded by troops of Takruri  pilgrims. These half-starved wretches cut steaks from the choice  portions, and slung them over their shoulders till an opportunity of  cooking might arrive. I never saw men more destitute. They carried  wooden bowls, which they filled with water by begging; their only  weapon was a small knife, tied in a leathern sheath above the elbow;  and their costume an old skull-cap, strips of leather like sandals  under the feet, and a long dirty shirt, or sometimes a mere rag  covering the loins. Some were perfect savages, others had been  fine-looking men, broad-shouldered, thin-flanked, and long-limbed; many  were lamed by fatigue and by thorns; and looking at most of them, I  fancied death depicted in their forms and features.    After two hours slow marching up the Fiumara eastwards, we saw in front  of us a wall of rock; and, turning abruptly southwards, we left the  bed, and ascended rising ground. Already it was night; an hour,  however, elapsed before we saw, at a distance, the twinkling fires, and  heard the watch-cries of our camp. It was    [p.63] pitched in a hollow, under hills, in excellent order; the Pashas  pavilion surrounded by his soldiers and guards disposed in tents, with  sentinels, regularly posted, protecting the outskirts of the  encampment. One of our men, whom we had sent forward, met us on the  way, and led us to an open place, where we unloaded the camels, raised  our canvas home, lighted fires, and prepared, with supper, for a good  nights rest. Living is simple on such marches. The pouches inside and  outside the Shugduf contain provisions and water, with which you supply  yourself when inclined. At certain hours of the day, ambulant vendors  offer sherbet, lemonade, hot coffee, and water-pipes admirably  prepared.[FN#6] Chibuks may be smoked in the litter; but few care to do  so during the Samu[m]. The first thing, however, called for at the  halting-place is the pipe, and its delightfully soothing influence,  followed by a cup of coffee, and a forty winks upon the sand, will awaken  an appetite not to be roused by other means. How could Waterton, the  traveller, abuse a pipe? During the night-halt, provisions are cooked:  rice, or Kichri, a mixture of pulse and rice, is eaten with Chutnee and  lime-pickle, varied, occasionally, by tough mutton and indigestible  goat.    We arrived at Ja al-Sharifah at eight P.M., after a march of about  twenty-two miles.[FN#7] This halting-place is    [p.64] the rendezvous of Caravans: it lies 50° south-east of Al-Madinah,  and belongs rather to Nijd than to Al-Hijaz.    At three A.M., on Thursday (Sept. 1), we started up at the sound of the  departure-gun, struck the tent, loaded the camels, mounted, and found  ourselves hurrying through a gloomy pass, in the hills, to secure a  good place in the Caravan. This is an object of some importance, as,  during the whole journey, marching order must not be broken. We met  with a host of minor accidents, camels falling, Shugdufs bumping  against one another, and plentiful abuse. Pertinaciously we hurried on  till six A.M., at which hour we emerged from the Black Pass. The large  crimson sun rose upon us, disclosing, through purple mists, a hollow of  coarse yellow gravel, based upon a hard whitish clay. About five miles  broad by twelve long, it collects the waters of the high grounds after  rain, and distributes the surplus through an exit towards the  North-west, a gap in the low undulating hills around. Entering it, we  dismounted, prayed, broke our fast, and after half an hours halt  proceeded to cross its breadth. The appearance of the Caravan was most  striking, as it threaded its slow way over the smooth surface of the  Khabt (low plain).[FN#8] To judge by the eye, the host was composed of  at fewest seven thousand souls, on foot, on horseback, in litters, or  bestriding the splendid camels of Syria.[FN#9] There were eight  gradations of pilgrims.    [p.65] The lowest hobbled with heavy staves. Then came the riders of  asses, of camels, and of mules. Respectable men, especially Arabs, were  mounted on dromedaries, and the soldiers had horses: a led animal was  saddled for every grandee, ready whenever he might wish to leave his  litter. Women, children, and invalids of the poorer classes sat upon a  Haml Musattah,rugs and cloths spread over the two large boxes which form  the camels load.[FN#10] Many occupied Shibriyahs; a few, Shugdufs, and  only the wealthy and the noble rode in Takht-rawan (litters), carried  by camels or mules.[FN#11] The morning beams fell brightly upon the  glancing arms which surrounded the stripped Mahmil,[FN#12] and upon the  scarlet and gilt conveyances of the grandees. Not the least beauty of  the spectacle was its wondrous variety of detail: no man was dressed  like his neighbour, no camel was caparisoned, no horse was    [p.66] clothed in uniform, as it were. And nothing stranger than the  contrasts; a band of half-naked Takruri marching with the Pashas  equipage, and long-capped, bearded Persians conversing with Tarbushd and  shaven Turks.    The plain even at an early hour reeked with vapours distilled by the  fires of the Samum: about noon, however, the air became cloudy, and  nothing of colour remained, save that milky white haze, dull, but  glaring withal, which is the prevailing day-tint in these regions. At  mid-day we reached a narrowing of the basin, where, from both sides, Irk,  or low hills, stretch their last spurs into the plain. But after half a  mile, it again widened to upwards of two miles. At two P.M. (Friday,  Sept. 2), we turned towards the South-west, ascended stony ground, and  found ourselves one hour afterwards in a desolate rocky flat, distant  about twenty-four miles of unusually winding road from our last  station. Mahattah Ghurab,[FN#13] or the Ravens Station, lies 10° south-west  from Ja al-Sharifah, in the irregular masses of hill on the frontier of  Al-Hijaz, where the highlands of Nijd begin.      After pitching the tent, we prepared to recruit our supply of water;  for Masud warned me that his camels had not drunk for ninety hours, and  that they would soon sink under the privation. The boy Mohammed,  mounting a dromedary, set off with the Shaykh and many water-bags,  giving me an opportunity of writing out my journal. They did not return  home until after nightfall, a delay caused by many adventures. The  wells are in a Fiumara, as usual, about two miles distant from the  halting-place, and the soldiers, regular as well as irregular, occupied  the water and exacted hard coin in exchange for it. The men are not to  blame; they would die of starvation but for this resource. The boy  Mohammed had been engaged in several quarrels; but after    [p.67] snapping his pistol at a Persian pilgrims head, he came forth  triumphant with two skins of sweetish water, for which we paid ten  piastres. He was in his glory. There were many Meccans in the Caravan,  among them his elder brother and several friends: the Sharif Zayd had  sent, he said, to ask why he did not travel with his compatriots. That  evening he drank so copiously of clarified butter, and ate dates mashed  with flour and other abominations to such an extent, that at night he  prepared to give up the ghost.    We passed a pleasant hour or two before sleeping. I began to like the  old Shaykh Masud, who, seeing it, entertained me with his genealogy, his  battles, and his family affairs. The rest of the party could not  prevent expressing contempt when they heard me putting frequent  questions about torrents, hills, Badawin, and the directions of places.  Let the Father of Moustachios ask and learn, said the old man; he is  friendly with the Badawin,[FN#14] and knows better than you all. This  reproof was intended to be bitter as the poets satire,    All fools have still an itching to deride,    And fain would be upon the laughing side.    It called forth, however[,] another burst of merriment, for the jeerers  remembered my nickname to have belonged to that pestilent heretic, Saud  the Wahhabi.    On Saturday, the 3rd September, the hateful signal-gun awoke us at one  A.M. In Arab travel there is nothing more disagreeable than the Sariyah  or night-march, and yet the people are inexorable about it. Choose early  Darkness (daljah) for your Wayfarings, said the Prophet, as the  Calamities of the Earth (serpents and wild beasts) appear not at Night.  I can scarcely find words to express the weary horrors of the long dark  march, during which the hapless traveller, fuming, if a European, with  disappointment in his hopes of seeing the country,  [p.68] is compelled to sit upon the back of a creeping camel. The  day-sleep, too, is a kind of lethargy, and it is all but impossible to  preserve an appetite during the hours of heat.

It was now, beyond doubt, that the sword of sorrow pierced  her through, for the queen of martyrs was terribly and mortally  wounded in that part which is impassible--that is, the soul; she  bore the death of the Cross in that part which could not die,  suffering all the more her grievous inward death, as outward death  departed further from her. Who, O most loving mother, can recount or  conceive in his mind the immeasurable sorrows of thy soul, or thine  inward woes? Him whom thou didst bring forth without pain, as a  blessed mother free from the curse of our first mother Eve, who  instead of the pains of labour wast filled with joy of spirit, and  who for thy refreshment didst listen to the sweet songs of the  angels as they praised thy Son, thou hast now seen slain before  thine eyes with the greatest cruelty and tyranny. How manifold was  that sorrow of thine, which thou wast permitted to escape at His  birth, when thou sawest thy blessed and only Son hanging in such  torment on the Cross, in the presence of a cruel and furious crowd,  who showered upon Him all the insults and contumely and shame that  they could think of; when thou sawest Him whom thou didst bear in  thy pure womb without feeling the burden, so barbarously stretched  on the Cross, and pierced with nails; when thou sawest His sacred  arms, with which He had so many times lovingly embraced thee,  stretched out so that He could not move them, and covered with red  blood, His adorable head pierced with sharp thorns, and His whole  body one streaming wound, while thou wast not able to staunch or  anoint any of those wounds. What must thy grief have been when thou  sawest Him whom thou hadst so often laid on thy virgin bosom that He  might rest, without anything on which to lean His sacred head; and  Him whom thou hadst nourished with the milk of thy holy breasts, now  vexed with vinegar and gall. O how thy maternal heart was oppressed  when thou beheldest with thy pure eyes that fair face so piteously  marred, so that there was no beauty in it, and nothing by which He  could be distinguished. How did the wave of affliction beat against  and overflow and overwhelm thy soul! Truly, if even a devout man  cannot without unspeakable sorrow and pity revolve in his mind the  Passion of thy Son, what must have been thy Cross, thy affliction,  who wast His mother and sawest it all with thine eyes? If to many  friends of God and to many who love Him, thy Son's Passion is as  grievous as if they suffered it themselves, if by inward pity they  are crucified with thy Son, how terribly, even unto death, must thou  have been crucified inwardly, when thou didst not only ponder and  search into the outward and inward pains of thy Son in thy devout  heart, but sawest them with thy bodily eyes? For never did any  mother love her child as thou lovedst thy Son. And if St Paul, who  loved so much, could say, out of his ardent love and deep pity for  thy Son, \"I am crucified with Christ; and I bear in my body the  marks of the Lord Jesus,\" how much more wert thou crucified with  Him, and didst inwardly receive all His wounds, being made, in a  manner, an image and likeness of thy crucified Son?    THE FOURTH WORD    ABOUT the ninth hour our Lord Jesus cried with a loud voice, \"My  God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\" He cried with a loud voice,  that He might be easily heard by all, and also that by this wondrous  word He might shake off from our souls the sleep of sloth, and cause  them to wonder and marvel at the immeasurable goodness of God to us.  Therefore He saith, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\" For  the sake of vile sinners, for evil and thankless servants, for  sinful and disobedient deceivers, Thou hast forsaken Thy beloved Son  and most obedient Child. That Thy enemies, who are vessels of wrath,  might be changed into children of adoption, Thou hast slain Thine  own Son, and given Him over to death like one guilty. \"O my God,  why, I pray Thee, hast Thou forsaken me?\" For the very cause why men  ought to praise and give thanks to Thee, and love Thee with an  everlasting love; because Thou hast delivered Thy dear Son to death  for their redemption, and sacrificed Him willingly, for this reason  they will find ground for blasphemy and reproach against Thee,  saying, \"He saith He is the Son of God. Let God deliver Him now if  He will have Him.\" Why, O my God, hast Thou willed to spend so  precious a treasure for such vile and counterfeit goods? Besides,  this word may be understood to have been spoken by Christ against  those who seek to diminish the glory of His Passion, by saying that  it was not really so bitter and terrible, owing to the great support  and comfort which He drew from His Godhead. Let those who speak and  think thus know that they renew His Passion and crucify Him afresh.  It was to prove the error of such men that our Lord cried with a  loud voice, and said, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\"  It is as if He had said these words to His own Divine nature, with  which He formed one Person--for the Godhead of the Father and of the  Son is all one--wondering, Himself, at His own love, which had so  cast Him down and worn Him out and humbled Him, and that He who  brings help to all mankind should have forsaken Himself, and offered  Himself to suffer every kind of pain, impelled thereto by conquering  love alone. Again, we should not be wrong, if we were to interpret  this word which Christ spoke out of the exceeding bitterness of His  sorrow in the following way--namely, that His spirit and inward man,  taking upon itself the severe judgment of God upon all sinners, and  at the same time discerning clearly and feeling and measuring in  Himself the intolerable weight of His Passion, on this account cried  out in a sorrowful voice to His Father, and complained tenderly to  Him because He had been cast into these dreadful torments; as if the  goodness of His Father had become so embittered against the sins of  men, that in the ardour of His justice He had quite forgotten the  inseparable union between His passible humanity and His impassible  Godhead, and therefore in the zealousness of His justice had quite  given up His passible nature to the cruelty and malice of fierce  men, that they might waste it away and destroy it. For this reason,  therefore, He said, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\"  This word has besides an inward meaning, according to which Christ,  in His sensitive parts, complained to His Father that He had been  forsaken by Him. For as many as contend for His honour, and endure  patiently the troubles of this world, our merciful God so moderates  and tempers their crosses and afflictions by the inpouring of His  divine consolation, that by His sensible grace He makes their  crosses hardly felt; but He left His own beloved Son quite without  any comfort, and so deprived Him of all consolation and light, that  He endured as much in His human nature as had been ordained by the  Eternal Wisdom, according to the strictness of justice, as much as  was needed to atone for so many sins. And indeed our salvation was  the more nobly and perfectly achieved, in that it was done and  finished without any light at all, in absolute resignation and  abandonment. For a chief cause of the Passion was to show clearly  how great was the injury and insult brought upon His most high  Godhead by the sins of the human race. Now as the knowledge of  Christ was greater and more acute than that of all other beings, in  heaven or in earth, so much the greater and heavier was His sorrow  and agony. Nay more--what is more wonderful than anything--whatever  afflictions have been endured by all the saints, as members of  Christ, existed much more abundantly in Christ their Head; and this  I wish to be understood according to the spirit and reasonably. For  all the saints have suffered no more than flowed in upon them  through Christ, joined to them as His members, who communicated to  them His own afflictions. For He took upon Himself the afflictions  of all the saints, out of His great love for His members, and  wondrous pity, and He suffered far greater internal anguish than any  of the saints, nay, more even than the blessed Virgin, His mother,  felt her own sharp sorrow and sickness of heart. For if an earthly  father loves his child so much, that in fatherly pity he takes upon  himself the sorrows of his child, and grieves for them as if he  suffered them himself, what must have been Christ's Cross and  compassion for the affliction of His members, and above all, of  those who suffered for His name's sake? Truly He bore witness to His  members, how much He suffered from their afflictions, and how great  was His inward pity for their sufferings, when He took all their  debt upon Himself, and abolished all the penalties which they had  merited, so that they might depart free. The same is most amply  proved by the words which He spoke to St Paul, when He said, \"Saul,  Saul, why persecutest thou Me?\" For the persecution which Saul had  stirred up against the disciples, the members of the Lord, was not  less grievous to Him than if He had suffered it Himself. Therefore  He says to His friends and members, \"He who touches you, touches the  apple of Mine eye.\" For is there anything suffered by the members,  which the Head does not suffer with them, He whose nature is  goodness, and whose property is always to have mercy and to forgive?    THE FIFTH WORD    OUR most tender Lord was so worn out and parched by the extreme  bitterness of His pain and suffering, and by the great loss of  blood, that He cried, \"I thirst.\" A little word, but full of  mysteries.    In the first place it may be understood literally. For it is natural  for those who are at the point of death to feel thirst, and to  desire to drink. But how great was the drouth felt by Him who is the  "]]]
