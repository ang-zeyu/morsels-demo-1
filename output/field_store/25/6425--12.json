So they called on Cheiron to sing, and  Achilles brought him his harp; and he began a wondrous song; a famous  story of old time, of the fight between the Centaurs and the Lapithai,  which you may still see carved in stone. {96}  He sang how his brothers  came to ruin by their folly, when they were mad with wine; and how they  and the heroes fought, with fists, and teeth, and the goblets from which  they drank; and how they tore up the pine-trees in their fury, and hurled  great crags of stone, while the mountains thundered with the battle, and  the land was wasted far and wide; till the Lapithai drove them from their  home in the rich Thessalian plains to the lonely glens of Pindus, leaving  Cheiron all alone.  And the heroes praised his song right heartily; for  some of them had helped in that great fight.    Then Orpheus took the lyre, and sang of Chaos, and the making of the  wondrous World, and how all things sprang from Love, who could not live  alone in the Abyss.  And as he sang, his voice rose from the cave, above  the crags, and through the tree-tops, and the glens of oak and pine.  And  the trees bowed their heads when they heard it, and the gray rocks  cracked and rang, and the forest beasts crept near to listen, and the  birds forsook their nests and hovered round.  And old Cheiron claps his  hands together, and beat his hoofs upon the ground, for wonder at that  magic song.    Then Peleus kissed his boy, and wept over him, and they went down to the  ship; and Cheiron came down with them, weeping, and kissed them one by  one, and blest them, and promised to them great renown.  And the heroes  wept when they left him, till their great hearts could weep no more; for  he was kind and just and pious, and wiser than all beasts and men.  Then  he went up to a cliff, and prayed for them, that they might come home  safe and well; while the heroes rowed away, and watched him standing on  his cliff above the sea, with his great hands raised toward heaven, and  his white locks waving in the wind; and they strained their eyes to watch  him to the last, for they felt that they should look on him no more.    So they rowed on over the long swell of the sea, past Olympus, the seat  of the Immortals, and past the wooded bays of Athos, and Samothrace the  sacred isle; and they came past Lemnos to the Hellespont, and through the  narrow strait of Abydos, and so on into the Propontis, which we call  Marmora now.  And there they met with Cyzicus, ruling in Asia over the  Dolions, who, the songs say, was the son of AEneas, of whom you will hear  many a tale some day.  For Homer tells us how he fought at Troy, and  Virgil how he sailed away and founded Rome; and men believed until late  years that from him sprang our old British kings.  Now Cyzicus, the songs  say, welcomed the heroes, for his father had been one of Cheiron's  scholars; so he welcomed them, and feasted them, and stored their ship  with corn and wine, and cloaks and rugs, the songs say, and shirts, of  which no doubt they stood in need.    But at night, while they lay sleeping, came down on them terrible men,  who lived with the bears in the mountains, like Titans or giants in  shape; for each of them had six arms, and they fought with young firs and  pines.  But Heracles killed them all before morn with his deadly poisoned  arrows; but among them, in the darkness, he slew Cyzicus the kindly  prince.    Then they got to their ship and to their oars, and Tiphys bade them cast  off the hawsers and go to sea.  But as he spoke a whirlwind came, and  spun the _Argo_ round, and twisted the hawsers together, so that no man  could loose them.  Then Tiphys dropped the rudder from his hand, and  cried, 'This comes from the Gods above.'  But Jason went forward, and  asked counsel of the magic bough.    Then the magic bough spoke, and answered, 'This is because you have slain  Cyzicus your friend.  You must appease his soul, or you will never leave  this shore.'    Jason went back sadly, and told the heroes what he had heard.  And they  leapt on shore, and searched till dawn; and at dawn they found the body,  all rolled in dust and blood, among the corpses of those monstrous  beasts.  And they wept over their kind host, and laid him on a fair bed,  and heaped a huge mound over him, and offered black sheep at his tomb,  and Orpheus sang a magic song to him, that his spirit might have rest.  And then they held games at the tomb, after the custom of those times,  and Jason gave prizes to each winner.  To Ancaeus he gave a golden cup,  for he wrestled best of all; and to Heracles a silver one, for he was the  strongest of all; and to Castor, who rode best, a golden crest; and  Polydeuces the boxer had a rich carpet, and to Orpheus for his song a  sandal with golden wings.  But Jason himself was the best of all the  archers, and the Minuai crowned him with an olive crown; and so, the  songs say, the soul of good Cyzicus was appeased and the heroes went on  their way in peace.    But when Cyzicus' wife heard that he was dead she died likewise of grief;  and her tears became a fountain of clear water, which flows the whole  year round.    Then they rowed away, the songs say, along the Mysian shore, and past the  mouth of Rhindacus, till they found a pleasant bay, sheltered by the long  ridges of Arganthus, and by high walls of basalt rock.  And there they  ran the ship ashore upon the yellow sand, and furled the sail, and took  the mast down, and lashed it in its crutch.  And next they let down the  ladder, and went ashore to sport and rest.    And there Heracles went away into the woods, bow in hand, to hunt wild  deer; and Hylas the fair boy slipt away after him, and followed him by  stealth, until he lost himself among the glens, and sat down weary to  rest himself by the side of a lake; and there the water nymphs came up to  look at him, and loved him, and carried him down under the lake to be  their playfellow, for ever happy and young.  And Heracles sought for him  in vain, shouting his name till all the mountains rang; but Hylas never  heard him, far down under the sparkling lake.  So while Heracles wandered  searching for him, a fair breeze sprang up, and Heracles was nowhere to  be found; and the _Argo_ sailed away, and Heracles was left behind, and  never saw the noble Phasian stream.    Then the Minuai came to a doleful land, where Amycus the giant ruled, and  cared nothing for the laws of Zeus, but challenged all strangers to box  with him, and those whom he conquered he slew.  But Polydeuces the boxer  struck him a harder blow than he ever felt before, and slew him; and the  Minuai went on up the Bosphorus, till they came to the city of Phineus,  the fierce Bithynian king; for Zetes and Calais bade Jason land there,  because they had a work to do.    And they went up from the shore toward the city, through forests white  with snow; and Phineus came out to meet them with a lean and woful face,  and said, 'Welcome, gallant heroes, to the land of bitter blasts, the  land of cold and misery; yet I will feast you as best I can.'  And he led  them in, and set meat before them; but before they could put their hands  to their mouths, down came two fearful monsters, the like of whom man  never saw; for they had the faces and the hair of fair maidens, but the  wings and claws of hawks; and they snatched the meat from off the table,  and flew shrieking out above the roofs.    Then Phineus beat his breast and cried, 'These are the Harpies, whose  names are the Whirlwind and the Swift, the daughters of Wonder and of the  Amber-nymph, and they rob us night and day.  They carried off the  daughters of Pandareus, whom all the Gods had blest; for Aphrodite fed  them on Olympus with honey and milk and wine; and Hera gave them beauty  and wisdom, and Athene skill in all the arts; but when they came to their  wedding, the Harpies snatched them both away, and gave them to be slaves  to the Erinnues, and live in horror all their days.  And now they haunt  me, and my people, and the Bosphorus, with fearful storms; and sweep away  our food from off our tables, so that we starve in spite of all our  wealth.'    Then up rose Zetes and Calais, the winged sons of the North-wind, and  said, 'Do you not know us, Phineus, and these wings which grow upon our  backs?'  And Phineus hid his face in terror; but he answered not a word.    'Because you have been a traitor, Phineus, the Harpies haunt you night  and day.  Where is Cleopatra our sister, your wife, whom you keep in  prison? and where are her two children, whom you blinded in your rage, at  the bidding of an evil woman, and cast them out upon the rocks?  Swear to  us that you will right our sister, and cast out that wicked woman; and  then we will free you from your plague, and drive the whirlwind maidens  to the south; but if not, we will put out your eyes, as you put out the  eyes of your own sons.'    Then Phineus swore an oath to them, and drove out the wicked woman; and  Jason took those two poor children, and cured their eyes with magic  herbs.    But Zetes and Calais rose up sadly and said, 'Farewell now, heroes all;  farewell, our dear companions, with whom we played on Pelion in old  times; for a fate is laid upon us, and our day is come at last, in which  we must hunt the whirlwinds over land and sea for ever; and if we catch  them they die, and if not, we die ourselves.'    At that all the heroes wept; but the two young men sprang up, and aloft  into the air after the Harpies, and the battle of the winds began.    The heroes trembled in silence as they heard the shrieking of the blasts;  while the palace rocked and all the city, and great stones were torn from  the crags, and the forest pines were hurled earthward, north and south  and east and west, and the Bosphorus boiled white with foam, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],[0,"The Robbers (#13)"],[1,"yet  graced the bier of royalty, one that should burn them all to cinders. I  fear for the city. He has long owed it a grudge for its intolerable  bigotry; and you know, when he says, \"I'll do it,\" the thing is as good  as done.    RAZ. That is true! I know the captain. If he had pledged his word to  the devil to go to hell he never would pray again, though half a  pater-noster would take him to heaven. Alas! poor Roller!--poor Roller!    SPIEGEL. _Memento mori_! But it does not concern me. (Hums a tune).            Should I happen to pass the gallows stone,           I shall just take a sight with one eye,          And think to myself, you may dangle alone,           Who now, sir, 's the fool, you or I?    RAZ. (Jumping up). Hark! a shot! (Firing and noise is heard behind the  scenes).    SPIEGEL. Another!    RAZ. And another! The captain!           (Voices behind the scenes are heard singing).            The Nurnbergers deem it the wisest plan,          Never to hang till they've caught their man.                           _Da capo_.    SCHWEITZER and ROLLER (behind the scenes). Holla, ho! Holla, ho!    RAZ. Roller! by all the devils! Roller!    SCHWEITZER and ROLLER (still behind the scenes).  Razman! Schwarz! Spiegelberg! Razman!    RAZ. Roller! Schweitzer! Thunder and lightning!  Fire and fury! (They run towards him.)    Enter CHARLES VON MOOR (on horseback), SCHWEITZER, ROLLER, GRIMM,  SCHUFTERLE, and a troop of ROBBERS covered with dust and mud.    CHARLES (leaping from his horse) Liberty! Liberty!--Thou art on terra  firma, Roller! Take my horse, Schweitzer, and wash him with wine.  (Throws himself on the ground.) That was hot work!    RAZ. (to ROLLER). Well, by the fires of Pluto! Art thou risen from  the wheel?    SCHWARZ. Art thou his ghost? or am I a fool? or art thou really the  man?    ROLLER (still breathless). The identical--alive--whole.--Where do you  think I come from?    SCHWARZ. It would puzzle a witch to tell! The staff was already broken  over you.    ROLLER. Ay, that it was, and more than that! I come straightway from  the gallows. Only let me get my breath. Schweitzer will tell you all.  Give me a glass of brandy! You there too, Spiegelberg! I thought we  should have met again in another place. But give me a glass of brandy!  my bones are tumbling to pieces. Oh, my captain! Where is my captain?    SCHWARZ. Have patience, man, have patience. Just tell me--say--come,  let's hear--how did you escape? In the name of wonder how came we to  get you back again? My brain is bewildered. From the gallows, you say?    ROLLER (swallows a flask of brandy). Ah, that is capital! that warms  the inside! Straight from the gallows, I tell you. You stand there  amid stare as if that was impossible. I can assure you, I was not more  than three paces from that blessed ladder, on which I was to mount to  Abraham's bosom--so near, so very near, that I was sold, skin and all,  to the dissecting-room! The fee-simple of my life was not worth a pinch  of snuff. To the captain I am indebted for breath, and liberty, and  life.    SCHWEITZER. It was a trick worth the telling. We had heard the day  before, through our spies, that Roller was in the devil's own pickle;  and unless the vault of heaven fell in suddenly he would, on the morrow  --that is, to-day--go the way of all flesh. Up! says the captain, and  follow me--what is not a friend worth? Whether we save him or not, we  will at least light him up a funeral pile such as never yet honored  royalty; one which shall burn them black and blue. The whole troop was  summoned. We sent Roller a trusty messenger, who conveyed the notice to  him in a little billet, which he slipped into his porridge.    ROLLER. I had but small hope of success.    SCHWEITZER. We waited till the thoroughfares were clear. The whole  town was out after the sight; equestrians, pedestrians, carriages, all  pell-mell; the noise and the gibbet-psalm sounded far and wide. Now,  says the captain, light up, light up! We all flew like darts; they set  fire to the city in three-and-thirty places at once; threw burning  firebrands on the powder-magazine, and into the churches and granaries.  Morbleu! in less than a quarter of an hour a northeaster, which, like  us, must have owed a grudge to the city, came seasonably to our aid, and  helped to lift the flames up to the highest gables. Meanwhile we ran up  and down the streets like furies, crying, fire! ho! fire! ho! in every  direction. There was such howling--screaming-tumult--fire-bells  tolling. And presently the powder-magazine blew up into the air with a  crash as if the earth were rent in twain, heaven burst to shivers, and  hell sunk ten thousand fathoms deeper.    ROLLER. Now my guards looked behind them--there lay the city, like  Sodom and Gomorrah--the whole horizon was one mass of fire, brimstone,  and smoke; and forty hills echoed and reflected the infernal prank far  and wide. A panic seized them all--I take advantage of the moment, and,  quick as lightning--my fetters had been taken off, so nearly was my time  come--while my guards were looking away petrified, like Lot's wife, I  shot off--tore through the crowd--and away! After running some sixty  paces I throw off my clothes, plunge into the river, and swim along  under water till I think they have lost sight of me. My captain stood  ready, with horses and clothes--and here I am. Moor! Moor! I only  wish that you may soon get into just such another scrape that I may  requite you in like manner.    RAZ. A brutal wish, for which you deserve to be hanged. It was a  glorious prank, though.    ROLLER. It was help in need; you cannot judge of it. You should have  marched, like me, with a rope round your neck, travelling to your grave  in the living body, and seen their horrid sacramental forms and  hangman's ceremonies--and then, at every reluctant step, as the  struggling feet were thrust forward, to see the infernal machine, on  which I was to be elevated, glaring more and more hideously in the blaze  of a noonday sun--and the hangman's rapscallions watching for their prey  --and the horrible psalm-singing--the cursed twang still rings in my  ears--and the screeching hungry ravens, a whole flight of them, who were  hovering over the half-rotten carcass of my predecessor. To see all  this--ay, more, to have a foretaste of the blessedness which was in  store for me! Brother, brother! And then, all of a sudden, the signal  of deliverance. It was an explosion as if the vault of heaven were rent  in twain. Hark ye, fellows! I tell you, if a man were to leap out of a  fiery furnace into a freezing lake he could not feel the contrast half  so strongly as I did when I gained the opposite shore.    SPIEGEL. (Laughs.) Poor wretch! Well, you have got over it. (Pledges  him). Here's to a happy regeneration!    ROLLER (flings away his glass). No, by all the treasures of Mammon, I  should not like to go through it a second time. Death is something more  than a harlequin's leap, and its terrors are even worse than death  itself.    SPIEGEL. And the powder-magazine leaping into the air! Don't you see  it now, Razman? That was the reason the air stunk so, for miles round,  of brimstone, as if the whole wardrobe of Moloch was being aired under  the open firmament. It was a master-stroke, captain! I envy you for  it.    SCHWEITZER. If the town makes it a holiday-treat to see our comrade  killed by a baited hog, why the devil should we scruple to sacrifice the  city for the rescue of our comrade? And, by the way, our fellows had  the extra treat of being able to plunder worse than the old emperor.  Tell me, what have you sacked?    ONE OF THE TROOP. I crept into St. Stephen's church during the hubbub,  and tore the gold lace from the altarcloth. The patron saint, thought I  to myself, can make gold lace out of packthread.    SCHWEITZER. 'Twas well done. What is the use of such rubbish in a  church? They offer it to the Creator, who despises such trumpery, while  they leave his creatures to die of hunger. And you, Sprazeler--where  did you throw your net?    A SECOND. I and Brizal broke into a merchant's store, and have brought  stuffs enough with us to serve fifty men.    A THIRD. I have filched two gold watches and a dozen silver spoons.    SCHWEITZER. Well done, well done! And we have lighted them a bonfire  that will take a fortnight to put out again. And, to get rid of the  fire, they must ruin the city with water. Do you know, Schufterle, how  many lives have been lost?    SCHUF. Eighty-three, they say. The powder-magazine alone blew  threescore to atoms.    CHARLES (very seriously). Roller, thou art dearly bought.    SCHUF. Bah! bah! What of that? If they had but been men it would have  been another matter--but they were babes in swaddling clothes, and  shrivelled old nurses that kept the flies from them, and dried-up  stove-squatters who could not crawl to the door--patients whining for the  doctor, who, with his stately gravity, was marching to the sport. All  that had the use of their legs had gone forth in the sight, and nothing  remained at home but the dregs of the city.    CHARLES. Alas for the poor creatures! Sick people, sayest thou, old  men and infants?    SCHUF. Ay, the devil go with them! And lying-in-women into the  bargain; and women far gone with child, who were afraid of miscarrying  under the gibbet; and young mothers, who thought the sight might do them  a mischief, and mark the gallows upon the foreheads of their unborn  babes--poor poets, without a shoe, because their only pair had been sent  to the cobbler to mend--and other such vermin, not worth the trouble of  mentioning. As I chanced to pass by a cottage I heard a great squalling  inside. I looked in; and, when I came to examine, what do you think it  was? Why, an infant--a plump and ruddy urchin--lying on the floor under  a table which was just beginning to burn. Poor little wretch! said I,  you will be cold there,"]]]
