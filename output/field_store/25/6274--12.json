[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/421"],[0,"Kidnapped (#13)"],[1," I have  no credit by it; it was by no choice of mine, but as if by compulsion,  that I walked right up to the table and put my hand on his shoulder.    \"Do ye want to be killed?\" said I. He sprang to his feet, and looked a  question at me as clear as if he had spoken.    \"O!\" cried I, \"they're all murderers here; it's a ship full of them!  They've murdered a boy already. Now it's you.\"    \"Ay, ay,\" said he; \"but they have n't got me yet.\" And then looking at me  curiously, \"Will ye stand with me?\"    \"That will I!\" said I. \"I am no thief, nor yet murderer. I'll stand by  you.\"    \"Why, then,\" said he, \"what's your name?\"    \"David Balfour,\" said I; and then, thinking that a man with so fine a  coat must like fine people, I added for the first time, \"of Shaws.\"    It never occurred to him to doubt me, for a Highlander is used to see  great gentlefolk in great poverty; but as he had no estate of his own,  my words nettled a very childish vanity he had.    \"My name is Stewart,\" he said, drawing himself up. \"Alan Breck, they  call me. A king's name is good enough for me, though I bear it plain and  have the name of no farm-midden to clap to the hind-end of it.\"    And having administered this rebuke, as though it were something of a  chief importance, he turned to examine our defences.    The round-house was built very strong, to support the breaching of the  seas. Of its five apertures, only the skylight and the two doors were  large enough for the passage of a man. The doors, besides, could be  drawn close: they were of stout oak, and ran in grooves, and were fitted  with hooks to keep them either shut or open, as the need arose. The  one that was already shut I secured in this fashion; but when I was  proceeding to slide to the other, Alan stopped me.    \"David,\" said he--\"for I cannae bring to mind the name of your landed  estate, and so will make so bold as to call you David--that door, being  open, is the best part of my defences.\"    \"It would be yet better shut,\" says I.    \"Not so, David,\" says he. \"Ye see, I have but one face; but so long as  that door is open and my face to it, the best part of my enemies will be  in front of me, where I would aye wish to find them.\"    Then he gave me from the rack a cutlass (of which there were a few  besides the firearms), choosing it with great care, shaking his head and  saying he had never in all his life seen poorer weapons; and next he set  me down to the table with a powder-horn, a bag of bullets and all the  pistols, which he bade me charge.    \"And that will be better work, let me tell you,\" said he, \"for a  gentleman of decent birth, than scraping plates and raxing* drams to a  wheen tarry sailors.\"         *Reaching.    Thereupon he stood up in the midst with his face to the door, and  drawing his great sword, made trial of the room he had to wield it in.    \"I must stick to the point,\" he said, shaking his head; \"and that's a  pity, too. It doesn't set my genius, which is all for the upper guard.  And, now,\" said he, \"do you keep on charging the pistols, and give heed  to me.\"    I told him I would listen closely. My chest was tight, my mouth dry, the  light dark to my eyes; the thought of the numbers that were soon to  leap in upon us kept my heart in a flutter: and the sea, which I heard  washing round the brig, and where I thought my dead body would be cast  ere morning, ran in my mind strangely.    \"First of all,\" said he, \"how many are against us?\"    I reckoned them up; and such was the hurry of my mind, I had to cast the  numbers twice. \"Fifteen,\" said I.    Alan whistled. \"Well,\" said he, \"that can't be cured. And now follow me.  It is my part to keep this door, where I look for the main battle. In  that, ye have no hand. And mind and dinnae fire to this side unless they  get me down; for I would rather have ten foes in front of me than one  friend like you cracking pistols at my back.\"    I told him, indeed I was no great shot.    \"And that's very bravely said,\" he cried, in a great admiration of my  candour. \"There's many a pretty gentleman that wouldnae dare to say it.\"    \"But then, sir,\" said I, \"there is the door behind you, which they may  perhaps break in.\"    \"Ay,\" said he, \"and that is a part of your work. No sooner the pistols  charged, than ye must climb up into yon bed where ye're handy at the  window; and if they lift hand against the door, ye're to shoot. But  that's not all. Let's make a bit of a soldier of ye, David. What else  have ye to guard?\"    \"There's the skylight,\" said I. \"But indeed, Mr. Stewart, I would need  to have eyes upon both sides to keep the two of them; for when my face  is at the one, my back is to the other.\"    \"And that's very true,\" said Alan. \"But have ye no ears to your head?\"    \"To be sure!\" cried I. \"I must hear the bursting of the glass!\"    \"Ye have some rudiments of sense,\" said Alan, grimly.          CHAPTER X    THE SIEGE OF THE ROUND-HOUSE    But now our time of truce was come to an end. Those on deck had waited  for my coming till they grew impatient; and scarce had Alan spoken, when  the captain showed face in the open door.    \"Stand!\" cried Alan, and pointed his sword at him. The captain stood,  indeed; but he neither winced nor drew back a foot.    \"A naked sword?\" says he. \"This is a strange return for hospitality.\"    \"Do ye see me?\" said Alan. \"I am come of kings; I bear a king's name. My  badge is the oak. Do ye see my sword? It has slashed the heads off mair  Whigamores than you have toes upon your feet. Call up your vermin to  your back, sir, and fall on! The sooner the clash begins, the sooner  ye'll taste this steel throughout your vitals.\"    The captain said nothing to Alan, but he looked over at me with an ugly  look. \"David,\" said he, \"I'll mind this;\" and the sound of his voice  went through me with a jar.    Next moment he was gone.    \"And now,\" said Alan, \"let your hand keep your head, for the grip is  coming.\"    Alan drew a dirk, which he held in his left hand in case they should run  in under his sword. I, on my part, clambered up into the berth with  an armful of pistols and something of a heavy heart, and set open the  window where I was to watch. It was a small part of the deck that I  could overlook, but enough for our purpose. The sea had gone down, and  the wind was steady and kept the sails quiet; so that there was a  great stillness in the ship, in which I made sure I heard the sound of  muttering voices. A little after, and there came a clash of steel upon  the deck, by which I knew they were dealing out the cutlasses and one  had been let fall; and after that, silence again.    I do not know if I was what you call afraid; but my heart beat like a  bird's, both quick and little; and there was a dimness came before my  eyes which I continually rubbed away, and which continually returned. As  for hope, I had none; but only a darkness of despair and a sort of anger  against all the world that made me long to sell my life as dear as I was  able. I tried to pray, I remember, but that same hurry of my mind, like  a man running, would not suffer me to think upon the words; and my chief  wish was to have the thing begin and be done with it.    It came all of a sudden when it did, with a rush of feet and a roar, and  then a shout from Alan, and a sound of blows and some one crying out  as if hurt. I looked back over my shoulder, and saw Mr. Shuan in the  doorway, crossing blades with Alan.    \"That's him that killed the boy!\" I cried.    \"Look to your window!\" said Alan; and as I turned back to my place, I  saw him pass his sword through the mate's body.    It was none too soon for me to look to my own part; for my head was  scarce back at the window, before five men, carrying a spare yard for  a battering-ram, ran past me and took post to drive the door in. I had  never fired with a pistol in my life, and not often with a gun; far less  against a fellow-creature. But it was now or never; and just as they  swang the yard, I cried out: \"Take that!\" and shot into their midst.    I must have hit one of them, for he sang out and gave back a step, and  the rest stopped as if a little disconcerted. Before they had time to  recover, I sent another ball over their heads; and at my third shot  (which went as wide as the second) the whole party threw down the yard  and ran for it.    Then I looked round again into the deck-house. The whole place was full  of the smoke of my own firing, just as my ears seemed to be burst with  the noise of the shots. But there was Alan, standing as before; only  now his sword was running blood to the hilt, and himself so swelled  with triumph and fallen into so fine an attitude, that he looked to be  invincible. Right before him on the floor was Mr. Shuan, on his hands  and knees; the blood was pouring from his mouth, and he was sinking  slowly lower, with a terrible, white face; and just as I looked, some of  those from behind caught hold of him by the heels and dragged him bodily  out of the round-house. I believe he died as they were doing it.    \"There's one of your Whigs for ye!\" cried Alan; and then turning to me,  he asked if I had done much execution.    I told him I had winged one, and thought it was the captain.    \"And I've settled two,\" says he. \"No, there's not enough blood let;  they'll be back again. To your watch, David. This was but a dram before  meat.\"    I settled back to my place, re-charging the three pistols I had fired,  and keeping watch with both eye and ear.    Our enemies were disputing not far off upon the deck, and that so loudly  that I could hear a word or two above the washing of the seas.    \"It was Shuan bauchled* it,\" I heard one say.         * Bungled.    And another answered him with a \"Wheesht, man! He's paid the piper.\"    After that the voices fell again into the same muttering as before. Only  now, one person spoke most of the time, as though laying down a plan,  and first one and then another answered him "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4210"],[0,"Our War with Spain for Cuba's Freedom (#13)"],[1,"fleet. Those were bloody days, full of dramatic  excitement. From them some of the most notable writers of fiction  have drawn their tales, which entertain readers of to-day.    What was done with all the gold thus garnered in sea fights before  it reached the ports of Spain, is hard to know. Sometimes  mysterious strangers appeared in the seaport towns of France and  England and even the American colonies in their younger days, to  spend money lavishly for a short time and then disappear as  mysteriously as they came. These men were reputed to be pirate  chiefs seeking relaxation from their customary life. Others of the  buccaneers hoarded their wealth in hiding places known only to  themselves, the secret of which must have died with them, while  the gold remains undiscovered. All through the Florida keys and  the West India islands, as well as along the coasts of Georgia and  the Carolinas, traditions still exist in relation to these  treasure hoards. Sanguine people are still digging in the sands of  these beaches, in the hope that some day they will unearth a sea  chest full of Spanish doubloons, or the golden ornaments stripped  from Aztec idols. Some finds indeed have been made, but those who  make them are not apt to reveal the secret which might guide  another to a successful search.    PIRATICAL RAIDS TROUBLE HAVANA.    Having discovered the wealth that could be obtained by attacks  upon the Spanish fleets, the pirates began to think of the cities  which were themselves the source of much of this wealth. The  result of this was that they began to make descents upon the  coasts, not only of Cuba, but of the neighboring islands of  Jamaica and Santo Domingo. The expense occasioned by the attempts  to suppress these incursions became so great toward the end of the  sixteenth century, that it became necessary to impose a special  tax to cover it.    Fortresses at all the fortified harbors were improved, and the  power of the military officials increased as their importance  increased, and that of the civil governors diminished. It was as a  direct result of these conditions that the office of Captain  General was created, in which the governor shared military and  civil authority alike. Havana fortifications were hastened to  completion and the preparations for defense began, which never  have been materially improved to this day. The three fortresses of  El Morro, La Punta and La Cabana were built before the end of the  sixteenth century and still were standing as the most effective  defenses of Havana when our war with Spain began.    It was during the same period, that African negroes were first  introduced into Cuba. Slavery had proved so severe upon the  aborigines, that their numbers had almost reached the vanishing  point, and there was a lack of sufficient labor for the cultivation  of tobacco and sugar cane, the chief products of Spanish  agriculture in the island. It was to promote the production of  these new luxuries that the African slave trade was begun. A royal  license from the King of Spain was obtained to guarantee the  privilege of importing negroes.    Then began that foul commerce which was another black stain on the  history of Spanish colonization of the western hemisphere. Spanish  ships descended upon the African coasts and kidnapped thousands of  negroes for service in the Cuban cane and tobacco fields. The  horrors of the trade cannot be magnified and are too distressing  for repetition. It is sufficient to say that in Havana it is  understood that the harbor was free from sharks which now swarm  there, until they followed the slave ships from the African coasts  in multitudes, for the feast of slaves who were thrown overboard  on the long voyage. Scores and hundreds of Africans died during  the journey, from the hardships they were compelled to undergo,  and Havana harbor itself was the last grave of many of these  hapless ones.    GREAT BRITAIN THREATENS SPANISH POSSESSIONS.    It was just after the middle of the seventeenth century and during  the rule of Oliver Cromwell in England, that the Spanish governors  of Cuba began to fear an attack by a British fleet. A squadron  sailed in 1655 with the design of capturing Jamaica, a purpose  which was easily accomplished. That island was taken by Great  Britain, the Spanish forces defending it were utterly defeated,  the governor was killed, and many of the inhabitants removed, in  consequence, to Cuba. From Jamaica the same fleet sailed for  Havana, but the attack was repulsed and the ships abandoned the  attempt. Except for the encroachments of the French upon the  island of Santo Domingo, and the continual piratical incursions of  French and English buccaneers, the Spanish in the West Indies were  not threatened with any more hostilities except by their own  internal dissensions until 1762. At that time Spain and England  were at war, Spain in alliance with the French, and it was decided  by the British government that Cuba was a vulnerable possession  and a valuable one that ought to be taken.    The capture of Havana by forces under the English flag fills  little space in the history of England and Spain, because of the  magnitude of the interests involved elsewhere. It is almost  forgotten in America, in spite of the bearing of all its  contemporary incidents upon the rapidly approaching revolution,  and yet it was an achievement of the colonial troops and  consequently the first assault upon Cuba by Americans.    It was an event of the first importance in its own day and  contained lessons of the first moment for the guidance of those  who had to plan the conduct of the war against Spain in 1898. It  proved that American troops under efficient officers could take  the field with success against double their number of Spaniards  fully provisioned and strongly intrenched. It proved that Havana  could be successfully assaulted by a combined military and naval  force, regardless of her picturesque but obsolete fortifications.  Spain's lack of administrative ability in the later war as well as  in the first, destroying any advantage to be derived from balls  and cannon. On the other side it proved that Americans had to look  forward to a considerable loss of life as a result of climatic  conditions, if they attempted to conduct hostile operations in  Cuba during the summer season.    The utter incapacity for straightforward, pertinacious fighting,  which both Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington found in the  Spanish army during the Peninsular war, was as conspicuous fifty  years before, when the Americans took Havana, and may rightly be  argued as perpetually inherent in the national character; for  though the annals of Spain are filled with instances of individual  courage of the first rank, demoralization sets in as soon as they  come together in numbers in the face of a civilized foe. Their  chief maneuver in the course of a century and a half, has been  just plain running away. The victorious Wellington, seeing his  Spanish allies running for dear life just after he had whipped the  opposing French line in the last battle of the peninsular  campaign, was moved to remark that he had seen many curious things  in his life, but never before 20,000 men engaged in a foot race.    Yet the fight made by the Spaniards in Havana during the attack of  the British and colonial forces in 1762 is the one notable  instance of a prolonged struggle between men who speak English and  men who speak Spanish. History may be searched in vain, either in  the old or new world, for a defense as able in point of  generalship or as stubborn in resistance as the Spaniards made at  the siege of Havana. In all other cases, from the Elizabethan  campaigns in Holland to the war with Mexico, the men educated in  the Spanish school of arms have been content to spend their  energies upon a single assault and then flee, sometimes even when  the odds were greatly in their favor.    The English Armada left Portsmouth on March 5th, 1762, under the  command of the gallant Admiral Pococke and Lord Albemarle, the  force moving in seven divisions. It consisted of nineteen ships of  the line, eighteen frigates or smaller men-of-war, and 150  transports containing about 10,000 soldiers, nearly all infantry.  At the Island of Hayti, then called Hispanola, the British were  joined by the successful expedition from Martinique. Together they  sat down before Havana, July 6th, 1762.    SPAIN'S INTELLECTUAL DRY ROT.    Spain, suffering, as it suffers to-day, from intellectual dry rot,  had known for weeks of the intended beleaguerment. Then, as now,  nothing adequate was done to meet it. The Governor of Havana, the  Marquis de Gonzalez, was a gallant soldier, as he was to prove;  but that ounce of prevention which is proverbially worth more than  the pound of cure, was not taken by him, and the British found the  fortifications in a partially ruinous condition, and the fourteen  ships of the line which were lying in the harbor before the city  in such a state that they could hardly be called in commission.  The Spanish army of defense numbered 27,000 men, and was in better  condition; but the Spanish sailors were utterly demoralized by the  granting of too much shore liberty, and the best use the Spaniard  could put his fighting ships to was by sinking them at the  entrance to the anchorage to prevent the entrance of the British  fleet. Once the enemy was before the city, however, all was  activity. The fortifications, which were too newly erected to be  quite incapable of repair, were set in order, the guns of Morro  Castle and of the fort known as the Puntal, across from it, were  trained on the advancing foe, and the Spanish ships were sunk, as  has been said.    Those familiar with the history of English administrative methods  during this period will find little to choose between them and the  methods of Spain.
