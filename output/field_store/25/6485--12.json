The fact that this manuscript of mine could be of no  possible value to any outside person convinces me that----\"    \"But, uncle, one moment; I know all about those things that were  stolen. It was Meadowes, my man, who pinched them. I caught him  snaffling my silk socks. Right in the act, by Jove!\"    He was tremendously impressed.    \"You amaze me, Bertie! Send for the man at once and question him.\"    \"But he isn't here. You see, directly I found that he was a  sock-sneaker I gave him the boot. That's why I went to London--to  get a new man.\"    \"Then, if the man Meadowes is no longer in the house it could not be  he who purloined my manuscript. The whole thing is inexplicable.\"    After which we brooded for a bit. Uncle Willoughby pottered about the  room, registering baffledness, while I sat sucking at a cigarette,  feeling rather like a chappie I'd once read about in a book, who  murdered another cove and hid the body under the dining-room table,  and then had to be the life and soul of a dinner party, with it there  all the time. My guilty secret oppressed me to such an extent that  after a while I couldn't stick it any longer. I lit another cigarette  and started for a stroll in the grounds, by way of cooling off.    It was one of those still evenings you get in the summer, when you can  hear a snail clear its throat a mile away. The sun was sinking over  the hills and the gnats were fooling about all over the place, and  everything smelled rather topping--what with the falling dew and so  on--and I was just beginning to feel a little soothed by the peace of  it all when suddenly I heard my name spoken.    \"It's about Bertie.\"    It was the loathsome voice of young blighted Edwin! For a moment I  couldn't locate it. Then I realised that it came from the library. My  stroll had taken me within a few yards of the open window.    I had often wondered how those Johnnies in books did it--I mean the  fellows with whom it was the work of a moment to do about a dozen  things that ought to have taken them about ten minutes. But, as a  matter of fact, it was the work of a moment with me to chuck away my  cigarette, swear a bit, leap about ten yards, dive into a bush that  stood near the library window, and stand there with my ears flapping.  I was as certain as I've ever been of anything that all sorts of  rotten things were in the offing.    \"About Bertie?\" I heard Uncle Willoughby say.    \"About Bertie and your parcel. I heard you talking to him just now. I  believe he's got it.\"    When I tell you that just as I heard these frightful words a fairly  substantial beetle of sorts dropped from the bush down the back of my  neck, and I couldn't even stir to squash the same, you will understand  that I felt pretty rotten. Everything seemed against me.    \"What do you mean, boy? I was discussing the disappearance of my  manuscript with Bertie only a moment back, and he professed himself as  perplexed by the mystery as myself.\"    \"Well, I was in his room yesterday afternoon, doing him an act of  kindness, and he came in with a parcel. I could see it, though he  tried to keep it behind his back. And then he asked me to go to the  smoking-room and snip some cigars for him; and about two minutes  afterwards he came down--and he wasn't carrying anything. So it must  be in his room.\"    I understand they deliberately teach these dashed Boy Scouts to  cultivate their powers of observation and deduction and what not.  Devilish thoughtless and inconsiderate of them, I call it. Look at the  trouble it causes.    \"It sounds incredible,\" said Uncle Willoughby, thereby bucking me up a  trifle.    \"Shall I go and look in his room?\" asked young blighted Edwin. \"I'm  sure the parcel's there.\"    \"But what could be his motive for perpetrating this extraordinary  theft?\"    \"Perhaps he's a--what you said just now.\"    \"A kleptomaniac? Impossible!\"    \"It might have been Bertie who took all those things from the very  start,\" suggested the little brute hopefully. \"He may be like  Raffles.\"    \"Raffles?\"    \"He's a chap in a book who went about pinching things.\"    \"I cannot believe that Bertie would--ah--go about pinching things.\"    \"Well, I'm sure he's got the parcel. I'll tell you what you might do.  You might say that Mr. Berkeley wired that he had left something here.  He had Bertie's room, you know. You might say you wanted to look for  it.\"    \"That would be possible. I----\"    I didn't wait to hear any more. Things were getting too hot. I sneaked  softly out of my bush and raced for the front door. I sprinted up to  my room and made for the drawer where I had put the parcel. And then I  found I hadn't the key. It wasn't for the deuce of a time that I  recollected I had shifted it to my evening trousers the night before  and must have forgotten to take it out again.    Where the dickens were my evening things? I had looked all over the  place before I remembered that Jeeves must have taken them away to  brush. To leap at the bell and ring it was, with me, the work of a  moment. I had just rung it when there was a footstep outside, and in  came Uncle Willoughby.    \"Oh, Bertie,\" he said, without a blush, \"I have--ah--received a  telegram from Berkeley, who occupied this room in your absence, asking  me to forward him his--er--his cigarette-case, which, it would appear,  he inadvertently omitted to take with him when he left the house. I  cannot find it downstairs; and it has, therefore, occurred to me that  he may have left it in this room. I will--er--just take a look  around.\"    It was one of the most disgusting spectacles I've ever seen--this  white-haired old man, who should have been thinking of the hereafter,  standing there lying like an actor.    \"I haven't seen it anywhere,\" I said.    \"Nevertheless, I will search. I must--ah--spare no effort.\"    \"I should have seen it if it had been here--what?\"    \"It may have escaped your notice. It is--er--possibly in one of the  drawers.\"    He began to nose about. He pulled out drawer after drawer, pottering  around like an old bloodhound, and babbling from time to time about  Berkeley and his cigarette-case in a way that struck me as perfectly  ghastly. I just stood there, losing weight every moment.    Then he came to the drawer where the parcel was.    \"This appears to be locked,\" he said, rattling the handle.    \"Yes; I shouldn't bother about that one. It--it's--er--locked, and all  that sort of thing.\"    \"You have not the key?\"    A soft, respectful voice spoke behind me.    \"I fancy, sir, that this must be the key you require. It was in the  pocket of your evening trousers.\"    It was Jeeves. He had shimmered in, carrying my evening things, and  was standing there holding out the key. I could have massacred the  man.    \"Thank you,\" said my uncle.    \"Not at all, sir.\"    The next moment Uncle Willoughby had opened the drawer. I shut my  eyes.    \"No,\" said Uncle Willoughby, \"there is nothing here. The drawer is  empty. Thank you, Bertie. I hope I have not disturbed you. I  fancy--er--Berkeley must have taken his case with him after all.\"    When he had gone I shut the door carefully. Then I turned to Jeeves.  The man was putting my evening things out on a chair.    \"Er--Jeeves!\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Oh, nothing.\"    It was deuced difficult to know how to begin.    \"Er--Jeeves!\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Did you--Was there--Have you by chance----\"    \"I removed the parcel this morning, sir.\"    \"Oh--ah--why?\"    \"I considered it more prudent, sir.\"    I mused for a while.    \"Of course, I suppose all this seems tolerably rummy to you, Jeeves?\"    \"Not at all, sir. I chanced to overhear you and Lady Florence speaking  of the matter the other evening, sir.\"    \"Did you, by Jove?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well--er--Jeeves, I think that, on the whole, if you were to--as it  were--freeze on to that parcel until we get back to London----\"    \"Exactly, sir.\"    \"And then we might--er--so to speak--chuck it away somewhere--what?\"    \"Precisely, sir.\"    \"I'll leave it in your hands.\"    \"Entirely, sir.\"    \"You know, Jeeves, you're by way of being rather a topper.\"    \"I endeavour to give satisfaction, sir.\"    \"One in a million, by Jove!\"    \"It is very kind of you to say so, sir.\"    \"Well, that's about all, then, I think.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    Florence came back on Monday. I didn't see her till we were all having  tea in the hall. It wasn't till the crowd had cleared away a bit that  we got a chance of having a word together.    \"Well, Bertie?\" she said.    \"It's all right.\"    \"You have destroyed the manuscript?\"    \"Not exactly; but----\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean I haven't absolutely----\"    \"Bertie, your manner is furtive!\"    \"It's all right. It's this way----\"    And I was just going to explain how things stood when out of the  library came leaping Uncle Willoughby looking as braced as a  two-year-old. The old boy was a changed man.    \"A most remarkable thing, Bertie! I have just been speaking with Mr.  Riggs on the telephone, and he tells me he received my manuscript by  the first post this morning. I cannot imagine what can have caused the  delay. Our postal facilities are extremely inadequate in the rural  districts. I shall write to headquarters about it. It is insufferable  if valuable parcels are to be delayed in this fashion.\"    I happened to be looking at Florence's profile at the moment, and at  this juncture she swung round and gave me a look that went right  through me like a knife. Uncle Willoughby meandered back to the  library, and there was a silence that you could have dug bits out of  with a spoon.    \"I can't understand it,\" I said at last. \"I can't understand it, by  Jove!\"    \"I can. I can understand it perfectly, Bertie. Your heart failed you.  Rather than risk offending your uncle you----\"    \"No, no! Absolutely!\"    \"You preferred to lose me rather than risk losing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8220"],[0,"Remarks (#13)"],[1,"of Verona. This is the place they came from. They have never  returned. Verona is not noted for its gentlemen now. Perhaps that is the  reason I was regarded as such a curiosity when I came here.    [Illustration: THE ODORS OF VERONA.]    Verona is a good deal older town than Chicago, but the two cities have  points of resemblance after all. When the southern simoon from the stock  yards is wafted across the vinegar orchards of Chicago, and a load of  Mormon emigrants get out at the Rock Island depot and begin to move around  and squirm and emit the fragrance of crushed Limburger cheese, it reminds  one of Verona.    The sky is similar, too. At night, when it is raining hard, the sky of  Chicago and Verona is not dissimilar. Chicago is the largest place,  however, and my sympathies are with her. Verona has about 68,000 people  now, aside from myself. This census includes foreigners and Indians not  taxed.    Verona has an ancient skating rink, known in history as the amphitheatre,  It is 404-1/2 feet by 516 in size, and the wall is still 100 feet high in  places. The people of Verona wanted me to lecture there, but I refrained.  I was afraid that some late comers might elbow their way in and leave one  end of the amphitheatre open and then there would be a draft. I will speak  more fully on the subject of amphitheatres in another letter. There isn't  room in this one.    Verona is noted for the Capitular library, as it is called. This is said  to be the largest collection of rejected manuscripts in the world. I stood  in with the librarian and he gave me an opportunity to examine this  wonderful store of literary work. I found a Virgil that was certainly over  1,600 years old. I also found a well preserved copy of \"Beautiful Snow.\" I  read it. It was very touching indeed. Experts said it was 1,700 years old,  which is no doubt correct. I am no judge of the age of MSS. Some can look  at the teeth of a literary production and tell within two weeks how old it  is, but I can't. You can also fool me on the age of wine. My rule used to  be to observe how old I felt the next day and to fix that as the age of  the wine, but this rule I find is not infallible. One time I found myself  feeling the next day as though I might be 138 years old, but on  investigation we found that the wine was extremely new, having been made  at a drug store in Cheyenne that same day.    [Illustration: THE NEXT MORNING.]    Looking these venerable MSS. over, I noticed that the custom of writing  with a violet pencil on both sides of the large foolscap sheet, and then  folding it in sixteen directions and carrying it around in the pocket for  two or three centuries, is not a late American invention, as I had been  led to suppose. They did it in Italy fifteen centuries ago. I was  permitted also to examine the celebrated institutes of Gaius. Gaius was a  poor penman, and I am convinced from a close examination of his work that  he was in the habit of carrying his manuscript around in his pocket with  his smoking tobacco. The guide said that was impossible, for smoking  tobacco was not introduced into Italy until a comparatively late day.  That's all right, however. You can't fool me much on the odor of smoking  tobacco.    The churches of Verona are numerous, and although they seem to me a little  different from our own in many ways, they resemble ours in others. One  thing that pleased me about the churches of Verona was the total absence  of the church fair and festival as conducted in America. Salvation seems  to be handed out in Verona without ice cream and cake, and the odor of  sancity and stewed oysters do not go inevitably hand in hand. I have  already been in the place more than two days and I have not yet been  invited to help lift the old church debt on the cathedral. Perhaps they  think I am not wealthy, however. In fact there is nothing about my dress  or manner that would betray my wealth. I have been in Europe now six weeks  and have kept my secret well. Even my most intimate traveling companions  do not know that I am the Laramie City postmaster in disguise.    The cathedral is a most imposing and massive pile. I quote this from the  guide book. This beautiful structure contains a baptismal font cut out of  one solid block of stone and made for immersion, with an inside diameter  of ten feet. A man nine feet high could be baptized there without injury.  The Venetians have a great respect for water. They believe it ought not to  be used for anything else but to wash away sins, and even then they are  very economical about it.    [Illustration]    There is a nice picture here by Titian. It looks as though it had been  left in the smoke house 900 years and overlooked. Titian painted a great  deal. You find his works here ever and anon. He must have had all he could  do in Italy in an early day, when the country was new. I like his pictures  first rate, but I haven't found one yet that I could secure at anything  like a bed rock price.          A Great Upheaval.    I have just received the following letter, which I take the liberty of  publishing, in order that good may come out of it, and that the public  generally may be on the watch:    William Nye, Esq.--    _Dear Sir:_ There has been a great religious upheaval here, and great  anxiety on the part of our entire congregation, and I write to you, hoping  that you may have some suggestions to offer that we could use at this time  beneficially.    All the bitter and irreverent remarks of Bob Ingersoll have fallen  harmlessly upon the minds of our people. The flippant sneers and wicked  sarcasms of the modern infidel, wise in his own conceit, have alike passed  over our heads without damage or disaster. These times that have tried  men's souls have only rooted us more firmly in the faith, and united us  more closely as brothers and sisters.    We do not care whether the earth was made in two billion years or two  minutes, so long as it was made and we are satisfied with it. We do not  care whether Jonah swallowed the whale or the whale swallowed Jonah. None  of these things worry us in the least. We do not pin our faith on such  little matters as those, but we try to so live that when we pass on beyond  the flood we may have a record to which we may point with pride.    But last Sabbath our entire congregation was visibly moved. People who had  grown gray in this church got right up during the service and went out,  and did not come in again. Brothers who had heard all kinds of infidelity  and scorned to be moved by it, got up, and kicked the pews, and slammed  the doors, and created a young riot.    For many years we have sailed along in the most peaceful faith, and  through joy or sorrow we came to the church together to worship. We have  laughed and wept as one family for a quarter of a century, and an humble  dignity and Christian style of etiquette have pervaded our incomings and  our outgoings.    That is the reason why a clear case of disorderly conduct in our church  has attracted attention and newspaper comment. That is the reason why we  want in some public way to have the church set right before we suffer from  unjust criticism and worldly scorn.    It has been reported that one of the brothers, who is sixty years of age,  and a model Christian, and a good provider, rose during the first prayer,  and, waving his plug hat in the air, gave a wild and blood-curdling whoop,  jumped over the back of his pew, and lit out. While this is in a measure  true, it is not accurate. He did do some wild and startling jumping, but  he did not jump over the pew. He tried to, but failed. He was too old.    It has also been stated that another brother, who has done more to build  up the church and society here than any other one man of his size, threw  his hymn book across the church, and, with a loud wail that sounded like  the word \"Gosh!\" hissed through clenched teeth, got out through the window  and went away. This is overdrawn, though there is an element of truth in  it, and I do not try to deny it.    There were other similar strong evidences of feeling throughout the  congregation, none of which had ever been noticed before in this place.  Our clergyman was amazed and horrified. He tried to ignore the action of  the brethren, but when a sister who has grown old in our church, and been  such a model and example of rectitude that all the girls in the county  were perfectly discouraged about trying to be anywhere near equal to her;  when she rose with a wild snort, got up on the pew with her feet, and  swung her parasol in a way that indicated that she would not go home till  morning, he paused and briefly wound up the services.    Of course there were other little eccentricities on the part of the  congregation, but these were the ones that people have talked about the  most, and have done us the most damage abroad.    Now, my desire is that through the medium of the press you will state that  this great trouble which has come upon us, by reason of which the ungodly  have spoken lightly of us, was not the result of a general tendency to  dissent from the statements made by our pastor, and therefore an  exhibition of our disapproval of his doctrines, but that the janitor had  started a light fire in the furnace, and that had revived a large nest of  common, streaked, hot-nosed wasps in the warm air pipe, and when they came  up through the register and united in the services, there was more or less  of an ovation.    Sometimes Christianity gets sluggish and comatose, but not under the above  circumstances. A man may slumber on softly with his bosom gently rising  and falling, and his breath coming and going through one corner of his  mouth like the death rattle of a bath-tub, while the pastor opens out a  new box of theological thunders and fills the air full of the sullen roar  of sulphurous waves, licking the shores of eternity and swallowing up the  great multitudes of the"]]]
