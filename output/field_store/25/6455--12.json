As the army drew near to the school, it melted away little by little,  each house claiming its representatives. At the school gates only a  handful were left.    Bob Jackson, walking back to Donaldson's, met Wyatt at the gate, and  gazed at him, speechless.    \"Hullo,\" said Wyatt, \"been to the nets? I wonder if there's time for a  ginger-beer before the shop shuts.\"          CHAPTER XII    MIKE GETS HIS CHANCE      The headmaster was quite bland and business-like about it all. There  were no impassioned addresses from the dais. He did not tell the  school that it ought to be ashamed of itself. Nor did he say that he  should never have thought it of them. Prayers on the Saturday morning  were marked by no unusual features. There was, indeed, a stir of  excitement when he came to the edge of the dais, and cleared his  throat as a preliminary to making an announcement. Now for it, thought  the school.    This was the announcement.    \"There has been an outbreak of chicken-pox in the town. All streets  except the High Street will in consequence be out of bounds till  further notice.\"    He then gave the nod of dismissal.    The school streamed downstairs, marvelling.    The less astute of the picnickers, unmindful of the homely proverb  about hallooing before leaving the wood, were openly exulting. It  seemed plain to them that the headmaster, baffled by the magnitude of  the thing, had resolved to pursue the safe course of ignoring it  altogether. To lie low is always a shrewd piece of tactics, and there  seemed no reason why the Head should not have decided on it in the  present instance.    Neville-Smith was among these premature rejoicers.    \"I say,\" he chuckled, overtaking Wyatt in the cloisters, \"this is all  right, isn't it! He's funked it. I thought he would. Finds the job too  big to tackle.\"    Wyatt was damping.    \"My dear chap,\" he said, \"it's not over yet by a long chalk. It hasn't  started yet.\"    \"What do you mean? Why didn't he say anything about it in Hall, then?\"    \"Why should he? Have you ever had tick at a shop?\"    \"Of course I have. What do you mean? Why?\"    \"Well, they didn't send in the bill right away. But it came all  right.\"    \"Do you think he's going to do something, then?\"    \"Rather. You wait.\"    Wyatt was right.    Between ten and eleven on Wednesdays and Saturdays old Bates, the  school sergeant, used to copy out the names of those who were in extra  lesson, and post them outside the school shop. The school inspected  the list during the quarter to eleven interval.    To-day, rushing to the shop for its midday bun, the school was aware  of a vast sheet of paper where usually there was but a small one. They  surged round it. Buns were forgotten. What was it?    Then the meaning of the notice flashed upon them. The headmaster had  acted. This bloated document was the extra lesson list, swollen with  names as a stream swells with rain. It was a comprehensive document.  It left out little.    \"The following boys will go in to extra lesson this afternoon and next  Wednesday,\" it began. And \"the following boys\" numbered four hundred.    \"Bates must have got writer's cramp,\" said Clowes, as he read the huge  scroll.           *       *       *       *       *    Wyatt met Mike after school, as they went back to the house.    \"Seen the 'extra' list?\" he remarked. \"None of the kids are in it, I  notice. Only the bigger fellows. Rather a good thing. I'm glad you got  off.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Mike, who was walking a little stiffly. \"I don't know  what you call getting off. It seems to me you're the chaps who got  off.\"    \"How do you mean?\"    \"We got tanned,\" said Mike ruefully.    \"What!\"    \"Yes. Everybody below the Upper Fourth.\"    Wyatt roared with laughter.    \"By Gad,\" he said, \"he is an old sportsman. I never saw such a man. He  lowers all records.\"    \"Glad you think it funny. You wouldn't have if you'd been me. I was  one of the first to get it. He was quite fresh.\"    \"Sting?\"    \"Should think it did.\"    \"Well, buck up. Don't break down.\"    \"I'm not breaking down,\" said Mike indignantly.    \"All right, I thought you weren't. Anyhow, you're better off than I  am.\"    \"An extra's nothing much,\" said Mike.    \"It is when it happens to come on the same day as the M.C.C. match.\"    \"Oh, by Jove! I forgot. That's next Wednesday, isn't it? You won't be  able to play!\"    \"No.\"    \"I say, what rot!\"    \"It is, rather. Still, nobody can say I didn't ask for it. If one goes  out of one's way to beg and beseech the Old Man to put one in extra,  it would be a little rough on him to curse him when he does it.\"    \"I should be awfully sick, if it were me.\"    \"Well, it isn't you, so you're all right. You'll probably get my place  in the team.\"    Mike smiled dutifully at what he supposed to be a humorous sally.    \"Or, rather, one of the places,\" continued Wyatt, who seemed to be  sufficiently in earnest. \"They'll put a bowler in instead of me.  Probably Druce. But there'll be several vacancies. Let's see. Me.  Adams. Ashe. Any more? No, that's the lot. I should think they'd give  you a chance.\"    \"You needn't rot,\" said Mike uncomfortably. He had his day-dreams,  like everybody else, and they always took the form of playing for the  first eleven (and, incidentally, making a century in record time). To  have to listen while the subject was talked about lightly made him hot  and prickly all over.    \"I'm not rotting,\" said Wyatt seriously, \"I'll suggest it to Burgess  to-night.\"    \"You don't think there's any chance of it, really, do you?\" said Mike  awkwardly.    \"I don't see why not? Buck up in the scratch game this afternoon.  Fielding especially. Burgess is simply mad on fielding. I don't blame  him either, especially as he's a bowler himself. He'd shove a man into  the team like a shot, whatever his batting was like, if his fielding  was something extra special. So you field like a demon this afternoon,  and I'll carry on the good work in the evening.\"    \"I say,\" said Mike, overcome, \"it's awfully decent of you, Wyatt.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Billy Burgess, captain of Wrykyn cricket, was a genial giant, who  seldom allowed himself to be ruffled. The present was one of the rare  occasions on which he permitted himself that luxury. Wyatt found him  in his study, shortly before lock-up, full of strange oaths, like the  soldier in Shakespeare.    \"You rotter! You rotter! You _worm_!\" he observed crisply, as  Wyatt appeared.    \"Dear old Billy!\" said Wyatt. \"Come on, give me a kiss, and let's be  friends.\"    \"You----!\"    \"William! William!\"    \"If it wasn't illegal, I'd like to tie you and Ashe and that  blackguard Adams up in a big sack, and drop you into the river. And  I'd jump on the sack first. What do you mean by letting the team down  like this? I know you were at the bottom of it all.\"    He struggled into his shirt--he was changing after a bath--and his  face popped wrathfully out at the other end.    \"I'm awfully sorry, Bill,\" said Wyatt. \"The fact is, in the excitement  of the moment the M.C.C. match went clean out of my mind.\"    \"You haven't got a mind,\" grumbled Burgess. \"You've got a cheap brown  paper substitute. That's your trouble.\"    Wyatt turned the conversation tactfully.    \"How many wickets did you get to-day?\" he asked.    \"Eight. For a hundred and three. I was on the spot. Young Jackson  caught a hot one off me at third man. That kid's good.\"    \"Why don't you play him against the M.C.C. on Wednesday?\" said Wyatt,  jumping at his opportunity.    \"What? Are you sitting on my left shoe?\"    \"No. There it is in the corner.\"    \"Right ho!... What were you saying?\"    \"Why not play young Jackson for the first?\"    \"Too small.\"    \"Rot. What does size matter? Cricket isn't footer. Besides, he isn't  small. He's as tall as I am.\"    \"I suppose he is. Dash, I've dropped my stud.\"    Wyatt waited patiently till he had retrieved it. Then he returned to  the attack.    \"He's as good a bat as his brother, and a better field.\"    \"Old Bob can't field for toffee. I will say that for him. Dropped a  sitter off me to-day. Why the deuce fellows can't hold catches when  they drop slowly into their mouths I'm hanged if I can see.\"    \"You play him,\" said Wyatt. \"Just give him a trial. That kid's a  genius at cricket. He's going to be better than any of his brothers,  even Joe. Give him a shot.\"    Burgess hesitated.    \"You know, it's a bit risky,\" he said. \"With you three lunatics out of  the team we can't afford to try many experiments. Better stick to the  men at the top of the second.\"    Wyatt got up, and kicked the wall as a vent for his feelings.    \"You rotter,\" he said. \"Can't you _see_ when you've got a good  man? Here's this kid waiting for you ready made with a style like  Trumper's, and you rave about top men in the second, chaps who play  forward at everything, and pat half-volleys back to the bowler! Do you  realise that your only chance of being known to Posterity is as the  man who gave M. Jackson his colours at Wrykyn? In a few years he'll be  playing for England, and you'll think it a favour if he nods to you in  the pav. at Lord's. When you're a white-haired old man you'll go  doddering about, gassing to your grandchildren, poor kids, how you  'discovered' M. Jackson. It'll be the only thing they'll respect you  for.\"    Wyatt stopped for breath.    \"All right,\" said Burgess, \"I'll think it over. Frightful gift of the  gab you've got, Wyatt.\"    \"Good,\" said Wyatt. \"Think it over. And don't forget what I said about  the grandchildren. You would like little Wyatt Burgess and the other  little Burgesses to respect you in your old age, wouldn't you? Very  well, then. So long. The bell went ages ago. I shall be locked out.\"           *       *       *       *       *    On the Monday morning Mike passed the notice-board just as Burgess  turned away from pinning up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7425"],[0,"The Louisa Alcott Reader: a Supplementary Reader for the Fourth Year of School (#13)"],[1,"wife and child.  When he saw Rosy, he dropped the lump, and caught her up, saying,--    \"My little girl! she's better than a million pounds of gold.\"    Then Rosy was very happy, and went back to the hut, and had a lovely  time telling her father all about her troubles and her travels. He cried  when he heard that the poor mother was dead before she could have any of  the good things the gold would buy them.    \"We will go away and be happy together in the pleasantest home I can  find, and never part any more, my darling,\" said the father, kissing  Rosy as she sat on his knee with her arms round his neck.    She was just going to say something very sweet to comfort him, when a  fly lit on her arm and buzzed very loud,--        \"Don't drive me away,      But hear what I say:    Bad men want the gold;      They will steal it to-night,      And you must take flight;    So be quiet and busy and bold.\"    \"I was afraid some one would take my lump away. I'll pack up at once,  and we will creep off while the men are busy at work; though I'm afraid  we can't go fast enough to be safe, if they miss us and come after,\"  said Tom, bundling his gold into a bag and looking very sober; for some  of the miners were wild fellows, and might kill him for the sake of that  great lump.    But the fly sang again,--        \"Slip away with me,      And you will see    What a wise little thing am I;      For the road I show      No man can know,    Since it's up in the pathless sky.\"    Then they followed Buzz to a quiet nook in the wood; and there were the  eagle and his mate waiting to fly away with them so fast and so far that  no one could follow. Rosy and the bag of gold were put on the mother  eagle; Tom sat astride the king bird; and away they flew to a great  city, where the little girl and her father lived happily together all  their lives.      [Illustration: Poor Billy dangling from a bough, high above the ground.]          VII.    HOW THEY RAN AWAY.      Two little boys sat on the fence whittling arrows one fine day. Said one  little boy to the other little boy,--    \"Let's do something jolly.\"    \"All right. What will we do?\"    \"Run off to the woods and be hunters.\"    \"What can we hunt?\"    \"Bears and foxes.\"    \"Mullin says there ain't any round here.\"    \"Well, we can shoot squirrels and snare wood-chucks.\"    \"Haven't got any guns and trap.\"    \"We've got our bows, and I found an old trap behind the barn.\"    \"What will we eat?\"    \"Here's our lunch; and when that's gone we can roast the squirrels and  cook the fish on a stick. I know how.\"    \"Where will you get the fire?\"    \"Got matches in my pocket.\"    \"I've got a lot of things we could use. Let's see.\"    And as if satisfied at last, cautious Billy displayed his treasures,  while bold Tommy did the same.    Besides the two knives there were strings, nails, matches, a piece of  putty, fish-hooks, and two very dirty handkerchiefs.    \"There, sir, that's a first-rate fit-out for hunters; and with the jolly  basket of lunch Mrs. Mullin gave us, we can get on tip-top for two or  three days,\" said Tommy, eager to be off.    \"Where shall we sleep?\" asked Billy, who liked to be comfortable both  night and day.    \"Oh, up in trees or on beds of leaves, like the fellows in our books. If  you are afraid, stay at home; I'm going to have no end of a good time.\"  And Tommy crammed the things back into his pockets as if there were no  time to lose.    \"Pooh! I ain't afraid. Come on!\" And jumping down Billy caught up his  rod, rather ashamed of his many questions.    No one was looking at them, and they might have walked quietly off; but  that the \"running away\" might be all right, both raced down the road,  tumbled over a wall, and dashed into the woods as if a whole tribe of  wild Indians were after them.    \"Do you know the way?\" panted Billy, when at last they stopped for  breath.    \"Yes, it winds right up the mountain; but we'd better not keep to it, or  some one will see us and take us back. We are going to be _real_ hunters  and have adventures; so we must get lost, and find our way by the sun  and the stars,\" answered Tommy, who had read so many Boys' Books his  little head was a jumble of Texan Rangers, African Explorers, and  Buffalo Bills; and he burned to outdo them all.    \"What will our mothers say if we really get lost?\" asked Billy, always  ready with a question.    \"Mine won't fuss. She lets me do what I like.\"    That was true; for Tommy's poor mamma was tired of trying to keep the  lively little fellow in order, and had got used to seeing him come out  of all his scrapes without much harm.    \"Mine will be scared; she's always afraid I'm going to get hurt, so I'm  careful. But I guess I'll risk it, and have some fun to tell about when  we go home,\" said Billy, trudging after Captain Tommy, who always took  the lead.    These eleven-year-old boys were staying with their mothers at a  farm-house up among the mountains; and having got tired of the tame  bears, the big barn, the trout brook, the thirty colts at pasture, and  the society of the few little girls and younger boys at the hotel near  by, these fine fellows longed to break loose and \"rough it in the bush,\"  as the hunters did in their favorite stories.    Away they went, deeper and deeper into the great forest that covered the  side of the mountain. A pleasant place that August day; for it was cool  and green, with many brooks splashing over the rocks, or lying in brown  pools under the ferns. Squirrels chattered and raced in the tall pines;  now and then a gray rabbit skipped out of sight among the brakes, or  a strange bird flew by. Here and there blackberries grew in the open  places, sassafras bushes were plentiful, and black-birch bark was ready  for chewing.    \"Don't you call this nice?\" asked Tommy, pausing at last in a little  dell where a noisy brook came tumbling down the mountain side, and the  pines sung overhead.    \"Yes; but I'm awful hungry. Let's rest and eat our lunch,\" said Billy,  sitting down on a cushion of moss.    \"You always want to be stuffing and resting,\" answered sturdy Tommy, who  liked to be moving all the time.    He took the fishing-basket, which hung over his shoulder by a strap,  and opened it carefully; for good Mrs. Mullin had packed a nice lunch of  bread and butter, cake and peaches, with a bottle of milk, and two large  pickles slipped in on the sly to please the boys.    Tommy's face grew very sober as he looked in, for all he saw was a box  of worms for bait and an old jacket.    \"By George! we've got the wrong basket. This is Mullin's, and he's gone  off with our prog. Won't he be mad?\"    \"Not as mad as I am. Why didn't you look? You are always in such a hurry  to start. What _shall_ we do now without anything to eat?\" whined Billy;  for losing his lunch was a dreadful blow to him.    \"We shall have to catch some fish and eat blackberries. Which will you  do, old cry-baby?\" said Tommy, laughing at the other boy's dismal face.    \"I'll fish; I'm so tired I can't go scratching round after berries. I  don't love 'em, either.\" And Billy began to fix his line and bait his  hook.    \"Lucky we got the worms; you can eat 'em if you can't wait for fish,\"  said Tommy, bustling about to empty the basket and pile up their few  possessions in a heap. \"There's a quiet pool below here, you go and fish  there. I'll pick the berries, and then show you how to get dinner in the  woods. This is our camp; so fly round and do your best.\"    Then Tommy ran off to a place near by where he had seen the berries,  while Billy found a comfortable nook by the pool, and sat scowling at  the water so crossly, it was a wonder any trout came to his hook. But  the fat worms tempted several small ones, and he cheered up at the  prospect of food. Tommy whistled while he picked, and in half an hour  came back with two quarts of nice berries and an armful of dry sticks  for the fire.    \"We'll have a jolly dinner, after all,\" he said, as the flames went  crackling up, and the dry leaves made a pleasant smell.    \"Got four, but don't see how we'll ever cook 'em; no frying-pan,\"  grumbled Billy, throwing down the four little trout, which he had half  cleaned.    \"Don't want any. Broil 'em on the coals, or toast 'em on a forked stick.  I'll show you how,\" said cheerful Tommy, whittling away, and feeding his  fire as much like a real hunter as a small boy could be.    While he worked, Billy ate berries and sighed for bread and butter. At  last, after much trouble, two of the trout were half cooked and eagerly  eaten by the hungry boys. But they were very different from the nice  brown ones Mrs. Mullin gave them; for in spite of Tommy's struggles they  would fall in the ashes, and there was no salt to eat with them. By the  time the last were toasted, the young hunters were so hungry they could  have eaten anything, and not a berry was left.    \"I set the trap down there, for I saw a hole among the vines, and I  shouldn't wonder if we got a rabbit or something,\" said Tommy, when the  last bone was polished. \"You go and catch some more fish, and I'll see  if I have caught any old chap as he went home to dinner.\"    Off ran Tommy; and the other boy went slowly back to the brook, wishing  with all his might he was at home eating sweet corn and berry pie.    The trout had evidently gone to their dinners, for not one bite did poor  Billy get; and he was just falling asleep when a loud shout gave him  such a fright that he tumbled into the brook up to his knees.    \"I've got him! Come and see! He's a bouncer,\" roared Tommy, from the  berry bushes some way off.    Billy scrambled out, and went as fast as his wet boots would let him, to  see what the prize was. He found Tommy dancing wildly round a fat gray  animal, who was fighting to get his paws out of the trap, and making a  queer noise as he struggled about.    \"What is it?\" asked Billy, getting behind a tree as fast as possible,  for the thing"]]]
