[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#13)"],[1," had accumulated, and which was continually being decimated and renewed.  In his day there were more books to be seen and handled there than now,  for some of the shops have since been devoted to other trades.  In  Holywell Street John Payne Collier was as well known as his own 'History  of English Dramatic Poetry,' which, nearly sixty years ago, littered the  stalls, doubtless to his great disgust, seeing that to be in evidence  there to any extent was then, as now, proof positive that the  'remainder-man' had been at work, to the bane of the author and  publisher alike.  Mr. W. Roberts, in his charming 'Book-hunter in  London,' narrates that Collier once picked up in Holywell Street for the  merest trifle a copy of John Hughes's 'Calypso and Telemachus,' an opera  in three acts, first published in 1712, which contained thirty-eight  unpublished couplets in the handwriting of Pope.  Halliwell-Phillipps  was also an inveterate rambler up and down this thoroughfare, and  several of his Shakespearean quartos came from there in days when these  small but almost priceless volumes were not so widely and persistently  sought for as they are now.  In fact, we have it in his own words that  when he first began to collect anything and everything that related in  whatever degree to the great dramatist, these early quartos were  frequently to be met with at prices which, comparatively speaking, sound  simply ludicrous in our ears.  Should anyone rescue a copy now from some  forgotten lumber-room, the fact is heralded by the press, and accounted  most extraordinary, as indeed it is; for everyone, the world over, is on  the look-out for rarities such as these. Though Holywell Street yet  stands, and does a thriving trade among the bookish, let not anyone  think that much is to be got for nothing there. On the contrary, the  dealers who inhabit it are better versed than most people in the  importance of each and every book they part with or throw into the boxes  which receive the outcasts of literature.  There are, however, good and  valuable books by the thousand to be met with by anyone who does not  object to pay a fair and reasonable price for them.  To this extent, and  in this particular, is Booksellers' Row the queen of London streets.  From these remarks I except, of course, the extremely important shops of  the West-End dealers into which correspondence flows from every part of  the world.    This chapter is devoted to the 'Hunting-grounds' of London, and I deny  that a collector who gives a standing order either verbally or by letter  to a bookseller for some work he particularly wants is a book-hunter at  all, at least so far as that particular transaction is concerned.  To my  mind Nimrod must handle his own bow and not entrust it to a deputy, even  though he might by the rules of the chase be absolutely entitled to the  quarry which the skill of the latter had brought down.  Let him go where  he will, East or West, the point of the compass makes no matter, he is a  hunter only when he prosecutes his own inquiries and carries out in  person all his arrangements.  So we will avoid the great firms of  book-sellers, although it may be taken for granted that almost any  scarce work could be procured sooner or later from them, and go off on a  chase in which we shall never, in all human probability, meet with any  great prize, and may have to be satisfied with a little, that little,  however, being much from many points of view.    At the present day books of all sorts are to be met with in great  profusion in Farringdon Street. Every Saturday morning throughout the  year light hand-carts to the number, perhaps, of thirty or forty, stand  in a long line against the curb, and each is packed with works of all  kinds.  I am bound to admit that obsolete school-books and forgotten  sermons constitute the great majority of these waifs and strays, but  there is always a wide choice of useful books to be got for purely  nominal sums, and occasionally one that is rare and valuable.  Personally I never met with a really scarce book in Farringdon Street,  but three years ago--and I mention this at the risk of being charged  with travelling from the subject--I bought there the undoubtedly  original study by Sir Joshua Reynolds for the portrait of the Right  Honourable George Seymour Conway, afterwards Lord George Seymour Conway.  The portrait was painted in 1770, and engraved in mezzotint by Edward  Fisher the year following.  The study is in oils, on thick paper of  about twelve inches in height, and is so remarkable as a work of art,  that it is a wonder it could have escaped recognition for an hour,  instead, as was the fact, for a whole morning.    Should Farringdon Street prove unpropitious, Sunday morning in any week  will see Lambeth Marshes and the New Cut, both on the Surrey side,  crowded with barrows, and the same remark applies to the streets about  the Elephant and Castle on Saturday evenings when the weather is fine.  Generally speaking, the peripatetic book-seller is only to be met with  on the first and last days of the week, but that he does manage to turn  over a considerable part of his stock in the short time available is not  to be doubted.  He may not change--many of these men have haunted the  same spot for years, and have their recognised stands--but his stock is,  in one sense, ever new. A few months ago I saw in the Whitechapel Road a  hand-cart full of small vellum-bound volumes, which proved to be Greek  and Latin classics, printed in Paris a couple of centuries ago. The  covers were remarkably fresh and clean, and somebody or other, or rather  a succession of owners, must have taken the greatest care of these  little books, which had thus ignobly fallen into the gutter at last.  Next week at the same hour, they had all gone, having been disposed of  to the more learned inhabitants of Bethnal Green at 2d. apiece.    If, however, wandering about the East End of London is not to the taste  of the picker-up of unconsidered trifles, there is still the more  primitive kind of shops to be visited.  Great Turnstile still boasts a  bookseller or two, and it was here, it will be remembered, that John  Bagford, many years ago, divided his attention between making boots and  shoes and ripping out the title-pages of the books that fell into his  sacrilegious hands.  He failed as a cobbler, but succeeded in amassing  the most disreputable collection of titles that has ever been got  together. The arch-Vandal failed in everything but his Vandalism, and  surely any success is better than none at all.  It is said of him that  he searched all his life for one of Caxton's impossible title-pages, and  died of disappointment, a story which is probably a gross libel on his  accomplishments, for Bagford was not by any means an uneducated man.    Then, Little Turnstile hard by is worth a casual visit, and there are  many shops in the streets extending east and west of St. Martin's Lane  where books are to be bought in almost any number.  The newly-built  Charing Cross Road appears to be under a cloud; in fact, at this point  we must turn back again, and make direct for Holborn, Bury Street, and  the neighbourhood of Red Lion Square and Queen Square.    In Red Lion Passage there are several of the quaintest shops imaginable,  one of them kept by a dealer who appears to have a mania for the very  largest folios, though I notice that of late he has somewhat fallen away  from his traditional custom in this respect.  The books stand on their  sides on the floor in columns of about six feet high; they are piled on  and under the counter, and are seen peeping out of the black darkness of  a room beyond.  Petrarch would have avoided this shop lest history  should repeat itself, and a folio break, not his leg merely this time,  but his neck.    On the other side of the Passage is another temple of gloom and mystery,  for it must be observed that the neighbourhood of Red Lion Square is  generally in semi-darkness all the year round, except in the winter, and  then it is frequently impossible to see at all when once the streets are  left.  The proprietors of this shop issue a periodical catalogue, which  can be taken from a box at the door, and it may safely be said that  there is no catalogue issued in London by anyone which is better worth  glancing over than this, notwithstanding an occasional misprint or two.  The books are, generally speaking, of such an unusual and out-of-the-way  kind that one cannot help wondering where they all come from.  For  instance, 'Ben Johnson's English Dictionary, 8vo., 1732,' must be a  remarkable volume, and the 'Wuremberg Chronicle, folio, numerous  wood-cuts, 1493,' equally curious.  Then there is 'Peasson on the  Creed,' 'Jewels, ----, Works, folio, 1611,' 'Locke, Humane  Understanding, folio, 1706,' 'Staunton: Shakispear,' and so on _ad  infinitum_.  Throughout the prices are moderate, extremely moderate;  that, at any rate, is a fact worthy of distinct recognition, and some of  the books, too, are anything but easy to procure, as witness Chaucer's  Works, folio, 1602, which is priced at L1 10s., Grafton's Chronicle,  folio, 1569, L1 5s., Swan's 'Speculum Mundi,' 4to., 1670, 3s., and many  others.  Dark though this shop may be to gaze upon, I regard it as a  typical book-man's paradise.    Paternoster Row, further east still, is now of course, the headquarters  of the publishers, though several second-hand booksellers still linger  there. Before the Great Fire reduced the whole district to ashes they  had it all their own way, and when the Row was rebuilt they flocked  there once more, to be gradually elbowed out by giant houses which sell  books wholesale.  There is one shop in this thoroughfare so completely  wedged up with books that it is a somewhat difficult matter to enter in  at the door.  Nobody who is not in the daily habit of passing by could  avoid stopping to glance at the rows of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46303"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 6 (of 8) (#13)"],[1,"place, and General Buller was slowly  making his way into the Transvaal from the east (guarding every inch of  the rail in his rear, so that when he should reach Heidelberg the Natal  Field Force would be extended all along the line), General Ian Hamilton,  in order to join hands with him, was moving with a mobile force _via_  Springs to Heidelberg, which was occupied on the 23rd. Both armies thus  approaching were now capable of frustrating concerted and combined action  between the hostile bands of the Transvaal and those still lingering in  Orange River Colony. Lord Dundonald's Brigade, meanwhile, had been joined  by Strathcona's Horse, a picked body of sporting men who were tingling  for fight.[6] This experience they soon enjoyed, as in the course of the  march towards Heidelberg they came on a gang of Boers and had an animated  encounter which cost them a man killed and two missing, including the  officer who was in command of the party. Four Boer victims were left on  the scene of the fray.    The Boers, though many were surrendering, were sustained in their dogged  determination to fight by the exquisite inventiveness of Mr. Kruger, who,  undoubtedly, is a Defoe or a De Rougemont lost to the world. He caused a  proclamation to be issued, stating that the Russians had declared war on  Japan, and that Great Britain was bound by treaty to support the  Japanese, and must therefore withdraw her troops from South Africa. The  proclamation also stated that Lord Roberts had no supplies, and implored  the burghers to keep up their courage. About a thousand burghers  accordingly collected in the neighbourhood of Sandspruit with the wily  ambition of severing the lines of communication. The Komati Poort Bridge  had been threatened, and the cauldron of Boer machination was simmering  portentously in the neighbourhood of Machadodorp.    With Buller's force on the east, Rundle's on the south, Hunter's to the  west, it was hoped that the animated De Wet might be trapped as Cronje  had been trapped. Still the wily one--slim by instinct, slimmer now by  experience--contrived to become slippery as an eel whenever the fingers  of the enveloping British hand began to curve in his direction. There was  no doubt about it that this sometime butcher of Barberton, this late  speculator in potatoes, who, it is stated, \"went bankrupt in an  unsuccessful attempt to establish a potato corner on the Johannesburg  market,\" was a born genius in the art of war. He was aware of his own  potentialities, and is reported to have said that he gave Lord  Kitchener--if he put his mind to it--ten days to catch him in, while to  Lord Roberts he allowed three weeks, and to Lord Methuen the rest of a  lifetime! And the statement was not all Boer bounce, as time proved.    General Hamilton from the west approached Heidelberg on the 22nd, and  exchanged shots with the Boer patrols; but during the night the enemy  disappeared and the troops occupied the town. The force consisted of  General Gordon's and General Broadwood's Cavalry Brigades (the 9th, 16th,  17th Lancers, and Household Cavalry, 10th Hussars, and 12th Lancers  respectively), two batteries Royal Horse Artillery, two batteries Field  Artillery, two 5-inch guns, a brigade of Mounted Infantry under General  Ridley, and the 21st Brigade (City Imperial Volunteers, Camerons, Sussex,  and Derbys) under General Bruce Hamilton. It was found that the Boers had  retreated to a crescent of hills turning south-east of the town, and from  here they fired on patrols of the New South Wales Contingent. General  Hamilton advanced on the Dutchman's haunts, while General Broadwood, with  a pom-pom and Field Battery, Roberts's Horse, the Ceylon Mounted  Infantry, and Marshall's Horse, made a vigorous flank attack which sent  the enemy scudding into space. The casualties were few. Among the wounded  were Captain F. Whittaker, Roberts's Horse, since dead; Captain H.  Carrington Smith, Royal Dublin Fusiliers; Captain M. Browne, Roberts's  Horse; Lieutenant C. Livingstone Learmonth, Roberts's Horse; Lieutenant  E. Rex King, Roberts's Horse. General Ian Hamilton unluckily fell from  his horse and sustained a fracture of the collar-bone.    Generals Hunter and Hart, therefore, hurriedly joined General Ian  Hamilton on the 25th at Heidelberg, the former replacing the latter in  command there, as General Hamilton's injury temporarily incapacitated him  from resuming his duties. How General Hunter managed so opportunely to  arrive on the scene must be described.    General Hunter, after taking Christiana, moved _via_ Vryburg,  Lichtenburg, Potchefstroom, and Krugersdorp to Johannesburg. With Colonel  Mahon--who had joined him and was in command of the Cavalry Brigade--he  had been engaged in the task of pacifying the Wolmaranstad and  Potchefstroom districts. Klerksdorp surrendered on the 9th of June  (uselessly, as it afterwards appeared). A few days later Colonel Mahon's  Cavalry Brigade entered Potchefstroom after a bitterly cold night march.  On the 15th General Hunter moved _via_ Krugersdorp (which surrendered on  the 18th), towards Johannesburg (Colonel Mahon preceding him and moving  to Pretoria) and went to Springs in support of General Hamilton's advance  to Heidelberg.    General Hunter's reduced force now consisted of the Dublin Fusiliers,  part of the Somersetshire Light Infantry, and a small number of the  Yeomanry. By the 25th he had taken over the command of General Hamilton's  column and at once proceeded to engage himself with the work that that  officer was intending to accomplish. General Hart before this time had  been at Frederickstad, some fifteen miles north of Potchefstroom on the  rail and best road to Johannesburg, but speedily moved on to assist. The  plan was to arrange for the permanent garrisoning of Frankfort in the  Orange River Colony, Heilbron, Lindley, and Senekal, the taking of  Bethlehem, and, if possible, the cornering of De Wet.    General Hunter marched from Heidelberg towards Frankfort with a view to  finding out the haunts of the malcontents, but encountered no  opposition, and reached his destination on the 1st of July. Two days  later he was joined by the troops from Heilbron under General Macdonald.  General Hart, with a battalion and a half of infantry, remained in  Heidelberg and engaged in the repair of the railway bridge, which had  been wrecked by the Boers.    Here for the nonce we must leave them while the operations in other parts  of the disturbed Colonies are investigated. General Buller had  accomplished his work of clearing Natal, and had joined hands with Lord  Roberts's force, and thus interposed a strong British barrier between  Botha at Middelburg and De Wet in Orange River Colony. These two  adventurous spirits had now to be tackled separately, and the cornering  of De Wet came first in Lord Roberts's programme. The commando of the  astute Free Stater was to be pushed eastward towards Bethlehem and  surrounded, and for this purpose General Hunter was to co-operate with  Generals Rundle, Clements, and Paget, while Lord Methuen in the  neighbourhood of Paardekraal (ten miles south-west of Heilbron on the  Kroonstad Road), was to mount guard over the rail between Kroonstad and  the Vaal River and prevent De Wet from breaking out westward.

In June he was vigilantly  guarding the Senekal-Ficksburg region, posting strong forces at intervals  along the road, and fixing his headquarters at Scheepers Nek. Here he was  strengthened by the arrival of General Campbell's Brigade (16th), while  General Brabant's Force moved along the line in order to keep a wary eye  on the guerilla bands that were intent on ravage and destruction. In a  day or two he returned to Hammonia, however, as swarms of the enemy were  circling about sniping, forcing Boers who had retired to their farms to  rejoin the rebels, destroying telegraph wires, attempting to cut off  parties of troops and to press their way towards the south, and, in fact,  making themselves generally offensive.    In consequence of Lord Roberts's proclamation, Free Staters remaining in  the field now became rebels. But Mr. Steyn issued a counterblast--warned  burghers to take no notice of the proclamation at their peril, and  declared the country was still an International Sovereign State, with a  President and properly constituted Government. The unfortunate burghers,  therefore, found themselves between two fires, and their sentiments must  have resembled those of the man who, torn between rival fair ones, cried,  \"How happy could I be with either, were t'other dear charmer away!\"  Botha, it was said, desired to surrender, but from sense of loyalty to De  Wet was prevented from so doing, both Dutchmen having agreed to hold out  so long as one remained uncaptured. De Wet was reported to be still  keeping together some 6000 men in the Orange River Colony, Botha with  some 5000 more, broken into marauding bands, was guarding the east of the  Transvaal, while Mr. Kruger and his allies between Machadodorp and  Nelspruit resided in a railway carriage, awaiting the whistle that should  warn them to steam off.    On the 19th General Rundle, accompanied by his staff, Colonel Maxwell and  Captain George Farrar of General Brabant's Division, made a careful  examination of Ficksburg and its fortifications, and afterwards, during a  reconnaissance, it was discovered that a hornet's nest was concealed in a  series of sinister kopjes near by. The desperadoes had guns, and without  doubt intended to use them should the British be caught in the open, but  they were playing a waiting game, at which pastime General Rundle  decided to show himself equally proficient. Further investigations proved  that the Boer lines between Ficksburg and Bethlehem were"]]]
