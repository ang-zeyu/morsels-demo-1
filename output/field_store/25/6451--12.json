Huten was told that on advancing more to the south-east he  would enter the territory of the great nation of the Omaguas, the  priest-king of which was called Quareca, and which possessed numerous  herds of llamas. These traces of cultivation--these ancient  resemblances to the table-land of Quito--appear to me very remarkable.  It has already been said above that Orellana saw llamas at the  dwelling of an Indian chief on the banks of the Amazon, and that Ordaz  had heard mention made of them in the plains of Meta.    I pause where ends the domain of geography and shall not follow Huten  in the description either of that town of immense extent, which he saw  from afar; or of the battle of the Omaguas, where thirty-nine  Spaniards (the names of fourteen are recorded in the annals of the  time) fought against fifteen thousand Indians. These false reports  contributed greatly to embellish the fable of El Dorado. The name of  the town of the Omaguas is not found in the narrative of Huten; but  the Manoas, from whom Father Fritz received, in the seventeenth  century, plates of beaten gold, in his mission of Yurim-Aguas, are  neighbours of the Omaguas. The name of Manoa subsequently passed from  the country of the Amazons to an imaginary town, placed in El Dorado  de la Parima. The celebrity attached to those countries between the  Caqueta (Papamene) and the Guaupe (one of the tributary streams of the  Rio Negro) excited Pedro de Ursua, in 1560, to that fatal expedition,  which ended by the revolt of the tyrant Aguirre. Ursua, in going down  the Caqueta to enter the river of the Amazons, heard of the province  of Caricuri. This denomination clearly indicates the country of gold;  for I find that this metal is called caricuri in the Tamanac, and  carucuru in the Caribbee. Is it a foreign word that denotes gold among  the nations of the Orinoco, as the words sugar and cotton are in our  European languages? This would prove that these nations learned to  know the precious metals among the foreign products which came to them  from the Cordilleras,* or from the plains at the eastern back of the  Andes. (* In Peruvian or Quichua (lengua del Inca) gold is called  cori, whence are derived chichicori, gold in powder, and corikoya,  gold-ore.)    We arrive now at the period when the fable of El Dorado was fixed in  the eastern part of Guiana, first at the pretended lake Cassipa (on  the banks of the Paragua, a tributary stream of the Carony), and  afterwards between the sources of the Rio Essequibo and the Rio  Branco. This circumstance has had the greatest influence on the state  of geography in those countries. Antonio de Berrio, son-in-law* (*  Properly casado con una sobrina. Fray Pedro Simon pages 597 and 608.  Harris Coll. volume 2 page 212. Laet page 652. Caulin page 175.  Raleigh calls Quesada Cemenes de Casada. He also confounds the periods  of the voyages of Ordaz (Ordace), Orellana (Oreliano), and Ursua. See  Empire of Guiana pages 13 to 20.) and sole heir of the great  Adelantado Gonzalo Ximenez de Quesada, passed the Cordilleras to the  east of Tunja,* (* No doubt between the Paramos of Chita and of  Zoraca, taking the road of Chire and Pore. Berrio told Raleigh that he  came from the Casanare to the Pato, from the Pato to the Meta, and  from the Meta to the Baraguan (Orinoco). We must not confound this Rio  Pato (a name connected no doubt with that of the ancient mission of  Patuto) with the Rio Paute.) embarked on the Rio Casanare, and went  down by this river, the Meta, and the Orinoco, to the island of  Trinidad. We scarcely know this voyage except by the narrative of  Raleigh; it appears to have preceded a few years the first foundation  of Vieja Guayana, which was in the year 1591. A few years later (1595)  Berrio caused his maese de campo, Domingo de Vera, to prepare in  Europe an expedition of two thousand men to go up the Orinoco, and  conquer El Dorado, which then began to be called the country of the  Manoa, and even the Laguna de la gran Manoa. Rich landholders sold  their farms, to take part in a crusade, to which twelve Observantin  monks, and ten secular ecclesiastics were annexed. The tales related  by one Martinez* (Juan Martin de Albujar?), who said he had been  abandoned in the expedition of Diego de Ordaz, and led from town to  town till he reached the capital of El Dorado, had inflamed the  imagination of Berrio. (* I believe I can demonstrate that the fable  of Juan Martinez, spread abroad by the narrative of Raleigh, was  founded on the adventures of Juan Martin de Albujar, well known to the  Spanish historians of the Conquest; and who, in the expedition of  Pedro de Silva (1570), fell into the hands of the Caribs of the Lower  Orinoco. This Albujar married an Indian woman and became a savage  himself, as happens sometimes in our own days on the western limits of  Canada and of the United States. After having long wandered with the  Caribs, the desire of rejoining the Whites led him by the Rio  Essequibo to the island of Trinidad. He made several excursions to  Santa Fe de Bogota, and at length settled at Carora. (Simon page 591).  I know not whether he died at Porto Rico; but it cannot be doubted  that it was he who learned from the Carib traders the name of the  Manoas [of Jurubesh]. As he lived on the banks of the Upper Carony and  reappeared by the Rio Essequibo, he may have contributed also to place  the lake Manoa at the isthmus of Rupunuwini. Raleigh makes his Juan  Martinez embark below Morequito, a village at the east of that  confluence of the Carony with the Orinoco. Thence he makes him dragged  by the Caribs from town to town, till he finds at Manoa a relation of  the inca Atabalipa (Atahualpa), whom he had known before at Caxamarca,  and who had fled before the Spaniards. It appears that Raleigh had  forgotten that the voyage of Ordaz (1531) was two years anterior to  the death of Atahualpa and the entire destruction of the empire of  Peru! He must have confounded the expedition of Ordaz with that of  Silva (1570), in which Juan Martin de Albuzar partook. The latter, who  related his tales at Santa Fe, at Venezuela, and perhaps at Porto  Rico, must have combined what he had heard from the Caribs with what  he had learned from the Spaniards respecting the town of the Omaguas  seen by Huten; of the gilded man who sacrificed in a lake, and of the  flight of the family of Atahualpa into the forests of Vilcabamba, and  the eastern Cordillera of the Andes. Garcilasso volume 2 page 194.) It  is difficult to distinguish what this conquistador had himself  observed in going down the Orinoco from what he said he had collected  in a pretended journal of Martinez, deposited at Porto Rico. It  appears that in general at that period the same ideas prevailed  respecting America as those which we have long entertained in regard  to Africa; it was imagined that more civilization would be found  towards the centre of the continent than on the coasts. Already Juan  Gonzalez, whom Diego de Ordaz had sent in 1531 to explore the banks of  the Orinoco, announced that \"the farther you went up this river the  more you saw the population increase.\" Berrio mentions the  often-inundated province of Amapaja, between the confluence of the  Meta and the Cuchivero, where he found many little idols of molten  gold, similar to those which were fabricated at Cauchieto, east of  Coro. He believed this gold to be a product of the granitic soil that  covers the mountainous country between the Carichana, Uruana, and  Cuchivero. In fact the natives have recently found a mass of native  gold in the Quebrada del Tigre near the mission of Encaramada. Berrio  mentions on the east of the province of Amapaja the Rio Carony  (Caroly), which was said to issue from a great lake, because one of  the tributary streams of the Carony, the Rio Paragua (river of the  great water), had been taken for an inland sea, from ignorance of the  Indian languages. Several of the Spanish historians believed that this  lake, the source of the Carony, was the Grand Manoa of Berrio; but the  notions he communicated to Raleigh show that the Laguna de Manoa (del  Dorado, or de Parime) was supposed to be to the south of the Rio  Paragua, transformed into Laguna Cassipa. \"Both these basins had  auriferous sands; but on the banks of the Cassipa was situate  Macureguarai (Margureguaira), the capital of the cacique of Aromaja,  and the first city of the imaginary empire of Guyana.\"    As these often-inundated lands have been at all times inhabited by  nations of Carib race, who carried on a very active inland trade with  the most distant regions, we must not be surprised that more gold was  found here in the hands of the Indians than elsewhere. The natives of  the coast did not employ this metal in the form of ornaments or  amulets only; but also as a medium of exchange. It is not  extraordinary, therefore, that gold has disappeared on the coast of  Paria, and among the nations of the Orinoco, their inland  communications have been impeded by the Europeans. The natives who  have remained independent are in our days, no doubt, more wretched,  more indolent, and in a ruder state, than they were before the  conquest. The king of Morequito, whose son Raleigh took to England,  had visited Cumana in 1594, to exchange a great quantity of images of  massy gold for iron tools, and European merchandise. The unexpected  appearance of an Indian chief augmented the celebrity of the riches of  the Orinoco. It was supposed that El Dorado must be near the country  from which the king of Morequito came; and as this country was often  inundated, and rivers vaguely called great seas, or great basins of  water, El Dorado must be on the banks of a lake. It was forgotten that  the gold brought by the Caribs and other trading people was as little  the produce of the soil as the diamonds of Brazil and India are the  produce of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7297"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#13)"],[1,"the shining forth or being  manifest by its own existence merely to its own substrate; the terms  'shining forth', 'illumining', 'being manifest' in both these  definitions meaning the capability of becoming an object of thought and  speech which is common to all things, whether intelligent or  non-intelligent. Eternity again means 'being present in all time';  oneness means 'being defined by the number one'. Even if you say that  these attributes are only negative ones, i.e. equal to the absence of  non-intelligence and so on, you still cannot avoid the admission that  they are attributes of consciousness. If, on the other hand, being of a  nature opposite to non-intelligence and so on, be not admitted as  attributes of consciousness--whether of a positive or a negative  kind--in addition to its essential nature; it is an altogether unmeaning  proceeding to deny to it such qualities, as non-intelligence and the  like.    We moreover must admit the following alternative: consciousness is  either proved (established) or not. If it is proved it follows that it  possesses attributes; if it is not, it is something absolutely nugatory,  like a sky-flower, and similar purely imaginary things.    [FOOTNOTE 54:1. The Sânkara is not entitled to refer to a distinction of  real and unreal division, because according to his theory all  distinction is unreal.]          Consciousness is the attribute of a permanent Conscious self.    Let it then be said that consciousness is proof (siddhih) itself. Proof  of what, we ask in reply, and to whom? If no definite answer can be  given to these two questions, consciousness cannot be defined as  'proof'; for 'proof' is a relative notion, like 'son.' You will perhaps  reply 'Proof to the Self'; and if we go on asking 'But what is that  Self'? you will say, 'Just consciousness as already said by us before.'  True, we reply, you said so; but it certainly was not well said. For if  it is the nature of consciousness to be 'proof' ('light,'  'enlightenment') on the part of a person with regard to something, how  can this consciousness which is thus connected with the person and the  thing be itself conscious of itself? To explain: the essential character  of consciousness or knowledge is that by its very existence it renders  things capable of becoming objects, to its own substrate, of thought and  speech. This consciousness (anubhûti), which is also termed jñâna,  avagati, samvid, is a particular attribute belonging to a conscious Self  and related to an object: as such it is known to every one on the  testimony of his own Self--as appears from ordinary judgments such as 'I  know the jar,' 'I understand this matter,' 'I am conscious of (the  presence of) this piece of cloth.' That such is the essential nature of  consciousness you yourself admit; for you have proved thereby its  self-luminousness. Of this consciousness which thus clearly presents  itself as the attribute of an agent and as related to an object, it  would be difficult indeed to prove that at the same time it is itself  the agent; as difficult as it would be to prove that the object of  action is the agent.    For we clearly see that this agent (the subject of consciousness) is  permanent (constant), while its attribute, i. e. consciousness, not  differing herein from joy, grief, and the like, rises, persists for some  time, and then comes to an end. The permanency of the conscious subject  is proved by the fact of recognition, 'This very same thing was formerly  apprehended by me.' The non-permanency of consciousness, on the other  hand, is proved by thought expressing itself in the following forms, 'I  know at present,' 'I knew at a time,' 'I, the knowing subject, no longer  have knowledge of this thing.' How then should consciousness and (the  conscious subject) be one? If consciousness which changes every moment  were admitted to constitute the conscious subject, it would be  impossible for us to recognise the thing seen to-day as the one we saw  yesterday; for what has been perceived by one cannot be recognised by  another. And even if consciousness were identified with the conscious  subject and acknowledged as permanent, this would no better account for  the fact of recognition. For recognition implies a conscious subject  persisting from the earlier to the later moment, and not merely  consciousness. Its expression is 'I myself perceived this thing on a  former occasion.' According to your view the quality of being a  conscious agent cannot at all belong to consciousness; for consciousness,  you say, is just consciousness and nothing more. And that there exists a  pure consciousness devoid of substrate and objects alike, we have  already refuted on the ground that of a thing of this kind we have  absolutely no knowledge. And that the consciousness admitted by both of  us should be the Self is refuted by immediate consciousness itself. And  we have also refuted the fallacious arguments brought forward to prove  that mere consciousness is the only reality.--But, another objection is  raised, should the relation of the Self and the 'I' not rather be  conceived as follows:--In self-consciousness which expresses itself in  the judgment 'I know,' that intelligent something which constitutes the  absolutely non-objective element, and is pure homogeneous light, is the  Self; the objective element (yushmad-artha) on the other hand, which is  established through its being illumined (revealed) by the Self is the  _I_--in 'I know'--and this is something different from pure  intelligence, something objective or external?    By no means, we reply; for this view contradicts the relation of  attribute and substrate of attribute of which we are directly conscious,  as implied in the thought 'I know.'    Consider also what follows.--'If the _I_ were not the Self, the  inwardness of the Self would not exist; for it is just the consciousness  of the _I_ which separates the inward from the outward.    '\"May I, freeing myself from all pain, enter on free possession of  endless delight?\" This is the thought which prompts the man desirous of  release to apply himself to the study of the sacred texts. Were it a  settled matter that release consists in the annihilation of the I, the  same man would move away as soon as release were only hinted at. \"When I  myself have perished, there still persists some consciousness different  from me;\" to bring this about nobody truly will exert himself.    'Moreover the very existence of consciousness, its being a consciousness  at all, and its being self-luminous, depend on its connexion with a Self;  when that connexion is dissolved, consciousness itself cannot be  established, not any more than the act of cutting can take place when  there is no person to cut and nothing to be cut. Hence it is certain  that the I, i.e. the knowing subject, is the inward Self.'    This scripture confirms when saying 'By what should he know the knower?'  (Bri. Up. II, 4, 15); and Smriti also, 'Him who knows this they call the  knower of the body' (Bha. Gî. XIII, 1). And the Sûtrakâra also, in the  section beginning with 'Not the Self on account of scriptural statement'  (II, 3, 17), will say 'For this very reason (it is) a knower' (II, 3,  18); and from this it follows that the Self is not mere consciousness.    What is established by consciousness of the 'I' is the I itself, while  the not-I is given in the consciousness of the not-I; hence to say that  the knowing subject, which is established by the state of consciousness,  'I know,' is the not-I, is no better than to maintain that one's own  mother is a barren woman. Nor can it be said that this 'I,' the knowing  subject, is dependent on its light for something else. It rather is  self-luminous; for to be self-luminous means to have consciousness for  one's essential nature. And that which has light for its essential  nature does not depend for its light on something else. The case is  analogous to that of the flame of a lamp or candle. From the  circumstance that the lamp illumines with its light other things, it  does not follow either that it is not luminous, or that its luminousness  depends on something else; the fact rather is that the lamp being of  luminous nature shines itself and illumines with its light other things  also. To explain.--The one substance tejas, i.e. fire or heat, subsists  in a double form, viz. as light (prabhâ), and as luminous matter.  Although light is a quality of luminous substantial things, it is in  itself nothing but the substance tejas, not a mere quality like e.g.  whiteness; for it exists also apart from its substrates, and possesses  colour (which is a quality). Having thus attributes different from those  of qualities such as whiteness and so on, and possessing illumining  power, it is the substance tejas, not anything else (e.g. a quality).  Illumining power belongs to it, because it lights up itself and other  things. At the same time it is practically treated as a quality because  it always has the substance tejas for its substrate, and depends on it.  This must not be objected to on the ground that what is called light is  really nothing but dissolving particles of matter which proceed from the  substance tejas; for if this were so, shining gems and the sun would in  the end consume themselves completely. Moreover, if the flame of a lamp  consisted of dissolving particles of matter, it would never be  apprehended as a whole; for no reason can be stated why those particles  should regularly rise in an agglomerated form to the height of four  fingers breadth, and after that simultaneously disperse themselves  uniformly in all directions--upwards, sideways, and downwards. The fact  is that the flame of the lamp together with its light is produced anew  every moment and again vanishes every moment; as we may infer from the  successive combination of sufficient causes (viz. particles of oil and  wick) and from its"]]]
