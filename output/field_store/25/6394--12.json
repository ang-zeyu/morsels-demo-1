All around was light and life and  colour, and I said to myself, 'He is made one with nature'; he is now,  body and soul and spirit, commingled with the loveliness around.  He who  longed in life to scale the height, he who attained his wish only in  death, has become in himself a parable of fulfilment.  No need now for  that heart-sick cry:--       \"'Sing me a song of a lad that is gone,     Say, could that lad be I?'    No need now for the despairing finality of:       \"'I have trod the upward and the downward slope,     I have endured and done in the days of yore,     I have longed for all, and bid farewell to hope,     And I have lived, and loved, and closed the door.'       \"Death has set his seal of peace on the unequal conflict of mind and     matter; the All-Mother has gathered him to herself.       \"In years to come, when his grave is perchance forgotten, a rugged     ruin, home of the lizard and the bat, Tusitala--the story-teller--'the     man with a heart of gold' (as I so often heard him designated in the     Islands), will live, when it may be his tales have ceased to interest,     in the tender remembrance of those whose lives he beautified, and     whose hearts he warmed into gratitude.\"    The chiefs have prohibited the use of firearms or other weapons on Mount  Vaea, \"in order that the birds may live there undisturbed and unafraid,  and build their nests in the trees around Tusitala's grave.\"    Miss Stubbs has many records of the impression produced on those he came  in contact with in Samoa--white men and women as well as natives.  She  met a certain Austrian Count, who adored Stevenson's memory.  Over his  camp bed was a framed photograph of R. L. Stevenson.       \"So,\" he said, \"I keep him there, for he was my saviour, and I wish     'good-night' and 'good-morning,' every day, both to himself and to his     old home.\"  The Count then told us that when he was stopping at     Vailima he used to have his bath daily on the verandah below his room.     One lovely morning he got up very early, got into the bath, and     splashed and sang, feeling very well and very happy, and at last     beginning to sing very loudly, he forgot Mr Stevenson altogether.  All     at once there was Stevenson himself, his hair all ruffled up, his eyes     full of anger.  \"Man,\" he said, \"you and your infernal row have cost     me more than two hundred pounds in ideas,\" and with that he was gone,     but he did not address the Count again the whole of that day.  Next     morning he had forgotten the Count's offence and was just as friendly     as ever, but--the noise was never repeated!    Another of the Count's stories greatly amused the visitors:       \"An English lord came all the way to Samoa in his yacht to see Mr     Stevenson, and found him in his cool Kimino sitting with the ladies,     and drinking tea on his verandah; the whole party had their feet bare.     The English lord thought that he must have called at the wrong time,     and offered to go away, but Mr Stevenson called out to him, and     brought him back, and made him stay to dinner.  They all went away to     dress, and the guest was left sitting alone in the verandah.  Soon     they came back, Mr Osbourne and Mr Stevenson wearing the form of dress     most usual in that hot climate a white mess jacket, and white     trousers, but their feet were still bare.  The guest put up his     eyeglass and stared for a bit, then he looked down upon his own     beautifully shod feet, and sighed.  They all talked and laughed until     the ladies came in, the ladies in silk dresses, befrilled with lace,     but still with bare feet, and the guest took a covert look through his     eyeglass and gasped, but when he noticed that there were gold bangles     on Mrs Strong's ankles and rings upon her toes, he could bear no more     and dropped his eyeglass on the ground of the verandah breaking it all     to bits.\"    Miss Stubbs met on the other side of the island a photographer who told  her this:       \"I had but recently come to Samoa,\" he said, \"and was standing one day     in my shop when Mr Stevenson came in and spoke.  'Man,' he said, 'I     tak ye to be a Scotsman like mysel'.'       \"I would I could have claimed a kinship,\" deplored the photographer,     \"but, alas!  I am English to the backbone, with never a drop of Scotch     blood in my veins, and I told him this, regretting the absence of the     blood tie.\"       \"'I could have sworn your back was the back of a Scotsman,' was his     comment, 'but,' and he held out his hand, 'you look sick, and there is     a fellowship in sickness not to be denied.' I said I was not strong,     and had come to the Island on account of my health.  'Well, then,'     replied Mr Stevenson, 'it shall be my business to help you to get     well; come to Vailima whenever you like, and if I am out, ask for     refreshment, and wait until I come in, you will always find a welcome     there.'\"       At this point my informant turned away, and there was a break in his     voice as he exclaimed, \"Ah, the years go on, and I don't miss him     less, but more; next to my mother he was the best friend I ever had: a     man with a heart of gold; his house was a second home to me.\"    Stevenson's experience shows how easy it is with a certain type of man,  to restore the old feudal conditions of service and relationship.  Stevenson did this in essentials in Samoa.  He tells us how he managed to  get good service out of the Samoans (who are accredited with great  unwillingness to work); and this he _did_ by firm, but generous, kindly,  almost brotherly treatment, reviving, as it were, a kind of clan  life--giving a livery of certain colours--symbol of all this.  A little  fellow of eight, he tells, had been taken into the household, made a pet  of by Mrs Strong, his stepdaughter, and had had a dress given to him,  like that of the men; and, when one day he had strolled down by himself  as far as the hotel, and the master of it, seeing him, called out in  Samoan, \"Hi, youngster, who are you?\"  The eight-year-old replied, \"Why,  don't you see for yourself?  I am one of the Vailima men!\"    The story of the _Road of the Loving Heart_ was but another fine  attestation of it.          CHAPTER XII--HIS GENIUS AND METHODS      To have created a school of idolaters, who will out and out swear by  everything, and as though by necessity, at the same time, a school of  studious detractors, who will suspiciously question everything, or throw  out suggestions of disparagement, is at all events, a proof of greatness,  the countersign of undoubted genius, and an assurance of lasting fame.  R.  L. Stevenson has certainly secured this.  Time will tell what of virtue  there is with either party.  For me, who knew Stevenson, and loved him,  as finding in the sweet-tempered, brave, and in some things, most  generous man, what gave at once tone and elevation to the artist, I would  fain indicate here my impressions of him and his genius--impressions that  remain almost wholly uninfluenced by the vast mass of matter about him  that the press now turns out.  Books, not to speak of articles, pour  forth about him--about his style, his art, his humour and his  characters--aye, and even about his religion.    Miss Simpson follows Mr Bellyse Baildon with the _Edinburgh Days_, Miss  Moyes Black comes on with her picture in the _Famous Scots_, and  Professor Raleigh succeeds her; Mr Graham Balfour follows with his_  Life_; Mr Kelman's volume about his Religion comes next, and that is  reinforced by more familiar letters and _Table Talk_, by Lloyd Osbourne  and Mrs Strong, his step-children; Mr J. Hammerton then comes on handily  with _Stevensoniana_--fruit lovingly gathered from many and far fields,  and garnered with not a little tact and taste, and catholicity; Miss  Laura Stubbs then presents us with her touching _Stevenson's Shrine_:  _the Record of a Pilgrimage_; and Mr Sidney Colvin is now busily at work  on his _Life of Stevenson_, which must do not a little to enlighten and  to settle many questions.    Curiosity and interest grow as time passes; and the places connected with  Stevenson, hitherto obscure many of them, are now touched with light if  not with romance, and are known, by name at all events, to every reader  of books.  Yes; every place he lived in, or touched at, is worthy of full  description if only on account of its associations with him.  If there is  not a land of Stevenson, as there is a land of Scott, or of Burns, it is  due to the fact that he was far-travelled, and in his works painted many  scenes: but there are at home--Edinburgh, and Halkerside and Allermuir,  Caerketton, Swanston, and Colinton, and Maw Moss and Rullion Green and  Tummel, \"the _wale_ of Scotland,\" as he named it to me, and the  Castletown of Braemar--Braemar in his view coming a good second to  Tummel, for starting-points to any curious worshipper who would go the  round in Scotland and miss nothing.  Mr Geddie's work on _The Home  Country of Stevenson_ may be found very helpful here.    1. It is impossible to separate Stevenson from his work, because of the  imperious personal element in it; and so I shall not now strive to gain  the appearance of cleverness by affecting any distinction here.  The  first thing I would say is, that he was when I knew him--what pretty much  to the end he remained--a youth.  His outlook on life was boyishly genial  and free, despite all his sufferings from ill-health--it was the pride of  action, the joy of endurance, the revelry of high spirits, and the sense  of victory that most fascinated him; and his theory of life was to take  pleasure and give pleasure, without calculation or stint--a kind of  boyish grace and bounty never to be overcome or disturbed by outer  accident or change.  If he was sometimes haunted with the thought of  changes through changed conditions or circumstances, as my very old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete (#13)"],[1,"is no matter; there will probably be some simple  enough to believe that you have made use of them all in this plain,  artless story of yours. At any rate, if it answers no other purpose, this  long catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look of  authority to your book. Besides, no one will trouble himself to verify  whether you have followed them or whether you have not, being no way  concerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book of yours has  no need of any one of those things you say it wants, for it is, from  beginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, of which  Aristotle never dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero had any  knowledge; nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations of astrology  come within the range of its fanciful vagaries; nor have geometrical  measurements or refutations of the arguments used in rhetoric anything to  do with it; nor does it mean to preach to anybody, mixing up things human  and divine, a sort of motley in which no Christian understanding should  dress itself. It has only to avail itself of truth to nature in its  composition, and the more perfect the imitation the better the work will  be. And as this piece of yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the  authority and influence which books of chivalry have in the world and  with the public, there is no need for you to go a-begging for aphorisms  from philosophers, precepts from Holy Scripture, fables from poets,  speeches from orators, or miracles from saints; but merely to take care  that your style and diction run musically, pleasantly, and plainly, with  clear, proper, and well-placed words, setting forth your purpose to the  best of your power, and putting your ideas intelligibly, without  confusion or obscurity. Strive, too, that in reading your story the  melancholy may be moved to laughter, and the merry made merrier still;  that the simple shall not be wearied, that the judicious shall admire the  invention, that the grave shall not despise it, nor the wise fail to  praise it. Finally, keep your aim fixed on the destruction of that  ill-founded edifice of the books of chivalry, hated by some and praised  by many more; for if you succeed in this you will have achieved no small  success.\"    In profound silence I listened to what my friend said, and his  observations made such an impression on me that, without attempting to  question them, I admitted their soundness, and out of them I determined  to make this Preface; wherein, gentle reader, thou wilt perceive my  friend's good sense, my good fortune in finding such an adviser in such a  time of need, and what thou hast gained in receiving, without addition or  alteration, the story of the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, who is held  by all the inhabitants of the district of the Campo de Montiel to have  been the chastest lover and the bravest knight that has for many years  been seen in that neighbourhood. I have no desire to magnify the service  I render thee in making thee acquainted with so renowned and honoured a  knight, but I do desire thy thanks for the acquaintance thou wilt make  with the famous Sancho Panza, his squire, in whom, to my thinking, I have  given thee condensed all the squirely drolleries that are scattered  through the swarm of the vain books of chivalry. And so--may God give  thee health, and not forget me. Vale.          DEDICATION OF PART I    TO THE DUKE OF BEJAR, MARQUIS OF GIBRALEON, COUNT OF BENALCAZAR AND  BANARES, VICECOUNT OF THE PUEBLA DE ALCOCER, MASTER OF THE TOWNS OF  CAPILLA, CURIEL AND BURGUILLOS    In belief of the good reception and honours that Your Excellency bestows  on all sort of books, as prince so inclined to favor good arts, chiefly  those who by their nobleness do not submit to the service and bribery of  the vulgar, I have determined bringing to light The Ingenious Gentleman  Don Quixote of la Mancha, in shelter of Your Excellency's glamorous name,  to whom, with the obeisance I owe to such grandeur, I pray to receive it  agreeably under his protection, so that in this shadow, though deprived  of that precious ornament of elegance and erudition that clothe the works  composed in the houses of those who know, it dares appear with assurance  in the judgment of some who, trespassing the bounds of their own  ignorance, use to condemn with more rigour and less justice the writings  of others. It is my earnest hope that Your Excellency's good counsel in  regard to my honourable purpose, will not disdain the littleness of so  humble a service.    Miguel de Cervantes          CHAPTER I.    WHICH TREATS OF THE CHARACTER AND PURSUITS OF THE FAMOUS GENTLEMAN DON  QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA      In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to  mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance  in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for  coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most  nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra  on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it  went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match  for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best  homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under  twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the  hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours  was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a  very early riser and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was  Quixada or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among  the authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable  conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is  of but little importance to our tale; it will be enough not to stray a  hair's breadth from the truth in the telling of it.    You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at  leisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to reading  books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely  neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his  property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that  he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and  brought home as many of them as he could get. But of all there were none  he liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva's composition,  for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in  his sight, particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships and  cartels, where he often found passages like \"the reason of the unreason  with which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I  murmur at your beauty;\" or again, \"the high heavens, that of your  divinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the  desert your greatness deserves.\" Over conceits of this sort the poor  gentleman lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand  them and worm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not  have made out or extracted had he come to life again for that special  purpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave  and took, because it seemed to him that, great as were the surgeons who  had cured him, he must have had his face and body covered all over with  seams and scars. He commended, however, the author's way of ending his  book with the promise of that interminable adventure, and many a time was  he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there  proposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made a successful piece  of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing thoughts prevented  him.    Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned  man, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better knight,  Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village  barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight  of Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with him it was  Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that  was equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose  like his brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind  him. In short, he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his  nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring  over them; and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so  dry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read  about in his books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds,  wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so  possessed his mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read  of was true, that to him no history in the world had more reality in it.  He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was  not to be compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one  back-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more  of Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of  enchantments, availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he  strangled Antaeus the son of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of the  giant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which is always  arrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But  above all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him  sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when  beyond the seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history  says, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of  a Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the"]]]
