These stiff, dry pelts are  much thought of, and played by the artistes by being shaken as  accompaniments to other instruments--they make a noise, and that is  after all the soul of most African instrumental music.  These  instruments are all that is left of certain bullocks which many  years ago the Spaniards introduced, hoping to improve the food  supply.  They seemed as if they would have flourished well on the  island, on the stretches of grass land in the Cordillera and the  East, but the Bubis, being great sportsmen, killed them all off.    The festivities of the Bubis--dances, weddings, feasts, etc.,--at  which this miscellaneous collection of instruments are used in  concert, usually take place in November, the dry season; but the  Bubi is liable to pour forth his soul in the bosom of his family at  any time of the day or night, from June to January, and when he  pours it forth on that bow affair it makes the lonely European long  for home.    Divisions of time the Bubi can hardly be said to have, but this is a  point upon which all West Africans are rather weak, particularly the  Bantu.  He has, however, a definite name for November, December, and  January--the dry season months--calling them Lobos.    The Fetish of these people, although agreeing on broad lines with  the Bantu Fetish, has many interesting points, as even my small  knowledge of it showed me, and it is a subject that would repay  further investigation; and as by fetish I always mean the governing  but underlying ideas of a man's life, we will commence with the  child.  Nothing, as far as I have been able to make out, happens to  him, for fetish reasons, when he first appears on the scene.  He  receives at birth, as is usual, a name which is changed for another  on his initiation into the secret society, this secret society  having also, as usual, a secret language.  About the age of three or  five years the boy is decorated, under the auspices of the witch  doctor, with certain scars on the face.  These scars run from the  root of the nose across the cheeks, and are sometimes carried up in  a curve on to the forehead.    Tattooing, in the true sense of the word, they do not use much, but  they paint themselves, as the mainlanders do, with a red paint made  by burning some herb and mixing the ash with clay or oil, and they  occasionally--whether for ju-ju reasons or for mere decoration I do  not know--paint a band of yellow clay round the chest; but of the  Bubi secret society I know little, nor have I been able to find any  one who knows much more.  Hutchinson, {61} in his exceedingly  amusing description of a wedding he was once present at among these  people, would lead one to think the period of seclusion of the  women's society was twelve months.    The chief god or spirit, O Wassa, resides in the crater of the  highest peak, and by his name the peak is known to the native.  Another very important spirit, to whom goats and sheep are offered,  is Lobe, resident in a crater lake on the northern slope of the  Cordilleras, and the grass you sometimes see a Bubi wearing is said  to come from this lake and be a ju-ju of Lobe's.  Dr. Baumann says  that the lake at Riabba from which the spirit Uapa rises is more  holy, and that he is small, and resides in a chasm in a rock whose  declivity can only be passed by means of bush ropes, and in the wet  season he is not get-at-able at all.  He will, if given suitable  offerings, reveal the future to Bubis, but Bubis only.  His priest  is the King of all the Bubis, upon whom it is never permitted to a  white man, or a Porto, to gaze.  Baumann also gives the residence of  another important spirit as being the grotto at Banni.  This is a  sea-cave, only accessible at low water in calm weather.  I have  heard many legends of this cave, but have never had an opportunity  of seeing it, or any one who has seen it first hand.    The charms used by these people are similar in form to those of the  mainland Bantu, but the methods of treating paths and gateways are  somewhat peculiar.  The gateways to the towns are sometimes covered  by freshly cut banana leaves, and during the religious feast in  November, the paths to the villages are barred across with a hedge  of grass which no stranger must pass through.    The government is a peculiar one for West Africa.  Every village has  its chief, but the whole tribe obey one great chief or king who  lives in the crater-ravine at Riabba.  This individual is called  Moka, but whether he is now the same man referred to by Rogoszinsky,  Mr. Holland, and the Rev. Hugh Brown, who attempted to interview him  in the seventies, I do not feel sure, for the Bubis are just the  sort of people to keep a big king going with a variety of  individuals.  Even the indefatigable Dr. Baumann failed to see Moka,  though he evidently found out a great deal about the methods of his  administration and formed a very high opinion of his ability, for he  says that to this one chief the people owe their present unity and  orderliness; that before his time the whole island was in a state of  internecine war:  murder was frequent, and property unsafe.  Now  their social condition, according to the Doctor's account, is a  model to Europe, let alone Africa.  Civil wars have been abolished,  disputes between villages being referred to arbitration, and murder  is swiftly and surely punished.  If the criminal has bolted into the  forest and cannot be found, his village is made responsible, and has  to pay a fine in goats, sheep and tobacco to the value of 16 pounds.  Theft is extremely rare and offences against the moral code also,  the Bubis having an extremely high standard in this matter, even the  little children having each a separate sleeping hut.  In old days  adultery was punished by cutting off the offender's hand.  I have  myself seen women in Fernando Po who have had a hand cut off at the  wrist, but I believe those were slave women who had suffered for  theft.  Slaves the Bubis do have, but their condition is the mild,  poor relation or retainer form of slavery you find in Calabar, and  differs from the Dualla form, for the slaves live in the same  villages as their masters, while among the Duallas, as among most  Bantu slave-holding tribes, the slaves are excluded from the  master's village and have separate villages of their own.  For  marriage ceremonies I refer you to Mr. Hutchinson.  Burial customs  are exceedingly quaint in the southern and eastern districts, where  the bodies are buried in the forest with their heads just sticking  out of the ground.  In other districts the body is also buried in  the forest, but is completely covered and an erection of stones put  up to mark the place.    Little is known of all West African fetish, still less of that of  these strange people.  Dr. Oscar Baumann brought to bear on them his  careful unemotional German methods of observation, thereby giving us  more valuable information about them and their island than we  otherwise should possess.  Mr. Hutchinson resided many years on  Fernando Po, in the capacity of H. B. M.'s Consul, with his hands  full of the affairs of the Oil Rivers and in touch with the Portos  of Clarence, but he nevertheless made very interesting observations  on the natives and their customs.  The Polish exile and his  courageous wife who ascended Clarence Peak, Mr. Rogoszinsky, and  another Polish exile, Mr. Janikowski, about complete our series of  authorities on the island.  Dr. Baumann thinks they got their  information from Porto sources--sources the learned Doctor evidently  regards as more full of imagination than solid fact, but, as you  know, all African travellers are occasionally in the habit of pooh-  poohing each other, and I own that I myself have been chiefly in  touch with Portos, and that my knowledge of the Bubi language runs  to the conventional greeting form: --\"Ipori?\"  \"Porto.\"  \"Ke Soko?'\"  \"Hatsi soko\": --\"Who are you?\"  \"Porto.\"  \"What's the news?\"  \"No  news.\"    Although these Portos are less interesting to the ethnologist than  the philanthropist, they being by-products of his efforts, I must  not leave Fernando Po without mentioning them, for on them the trade  of the island depends.  They are the middlemen between the Bubi and  the white trader.  The former regards them with little, if any, more  trust than he regards the white men, and his view of the position of  the Spanish Governor is that he is chief over the Portos.  That he  has any headship over Bubis or over the Bubi land--Itschulla as he  calls Fernando Po--he does not imagine possible.  Baumann says he  was once told by a Bubi:  \"White men are fish, not men.  They are  able to stay a little while on land, but at last they mount their  ships again and vanish over the horizon into the ocean.  How can a  fish possess land?\"  If the coffee and cacao thrive on Fernando Po  to the same extent that they have already thriven on San Thome there  is but little doubt that the Bubis will become extinct; for work on  plantations, either for other people, or themselves, they will not,  and then the Portos will become the most important class, for they  will go in for plantations.  Their little factories are studded all  round the shores of the coast in suitable coves and bays, and here  in fairly neat houses they live, collecting palm-oil from the Bubis,  and making themselves little cacao plantations, and bringing these  products into Clarence every now and then to the white trader's  factory.  Then, after spending some time and most of their money in  the giddy whirl of that capital, they return to their homes and  recover.  There is a class of them permanently resident in Clarence,  the city men of Fernando Po, and these are very like the Sierra  Leonians of Free Town, but preferable.  Their origin is practically  the same as that of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59"],[0,"Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth (#13)"],[1,"d,  whom he could pay, and whom the hope of gain (a means of great  efficacy) might stimulate to accuracy in the performance of what was  prescribed to them.  For as to those who, through curiosity or a desire  of learning, of their own accord, perhaps, offer him their services,  besides that in general their promises exceed their performance, and  that they sketch out fine designs of which not one is ever realized,  they will, without doubt, expect to be compensated for their trouble by  the explication of some difficulties, or, at least, by compliments and  useless speeches, in which he cannot spend any portion of his time  without loss to himself.  And as for the experiments that others have  already made, even although these parties should be willing of  themselves to communicate them to him (which is what those who esteem  them secrets will never do), the experiments are, for the most part,  accompanied with so many circumstances and superfluous elements, as to  make it exceedingly difficult to disentangle the truth from its  adjuncts--besides, he will find almost all of them so ill described, or  even so false (because those who made them have wished to see in them  only such facts as they deemed conformable to their principles), that,  if in the entire number there should be some of a nature suited to his  purpose, still their value could not compensate for the time what would  be necessary to make the selection.  So that if there existed any one  whom we assuredly knew to be capable of making discoveries of the  highest kind, and of the greatest possible utility to the public; and  if all other men were therefore eager by all means to assist him in  successfully prosecuting his designs, I do not see that they could do  aught else for him beyond contributing to defray the expenses of the  experiments that might be necessary; and for the rest, prevent his  being deprived of his leisure by the unseasonable interruptions of any  one.  But besides that I neither have so high an opinion of myself as  to be willing to make promise of anything extraordinary, nor feed on  imaginations so vain as to fancy that the public must be much  interested in my designs; I do not, on the other hand, own a soul so  mean as to be capable of accepting from any one a favor of which it  could be supposed that I was unworthy.    These considerations taken together were the reason why, for the last  three years, I have been unwilling to publish the treatise I had on  hand, and why I even resolved to give publicity during my life to no  other that was so general, or by which the principles of my physics  might be understood.  But since then, two other reasons have come into  operation that have determined me here to subjoin some particular  specimens, and give the public some account of my doings and designs.  Of these considerations, the first is, that if I failed to do so, many  who were cognizant of my previous intention to publish some writings,  might have imagined that the reasons which induced me to refrain from  so doing, were less to my credit than they really are; for although I  am not immoderately desirous of glory, or even, if I may venture so to  say, although I am averse from it in so far as I deem it hostile to  repose which I hold in greater account than aught else, yet, at the  same time, I have never sought to conceal my actions as if they were  crimes, nor made use of many precautions that I might remain unknown;  and this partly because I should have thought such a course of conduct  a wrong against myself, and partly because it would have occasioned me  some sort of uneasiness which would again have been contrary to the  perfect mental tranquillity which I court.  And forasmuch as, while  thus indifferent to the thought alike of fame or of forgetfulness, I  have yet been unable to prevent myself from acquiring some sort of  reputation, I have thought it incumbent on me to do my best to save  myself at least from being ill-spoken of.  The other reason that has  determined me to commit to writing these specimens of philosophy is,  that I am becoming daily more and more alive to the delay which my  design of self-instruction suffers, for want of the infinity of  experiments I require, and which it is impossible for me to make  without the assistance of others:  and, without flattering myself so  much as to expect the public to take a large share in my interests, I  am yet unwilling to be found so far wanting in the duty I owe to  myself, as to give occasion to those who shall survive me to make it  matter of reproach against me some day, that I might have left them  many things in a much more perfect state than I have done, had I not  too much neglected to make them aware of the ways in which they could  have promoted the accomplishment of my designs.    And I thought that it was easy for me to select some matters which  should neither be obnoxious to much controversy, nor should compel me  to expound more of my principles than I desired, and which should yet  be sufficient clearly to exhibit what I can or cannot accomplish in the  sciences.  Whether or not I have succeeded in this it is not for me to  say; and I do not wish to forestall the judgments of others by speaking  myself of my writings; but it will gratify me if they be examined, and,  to afford the greater inducement to this I request all who may have any  objections to make to them, to take the trouble of forwarding these to  my publisher, who will give me notice of them, that I may endeavor to  subjoin at the same time my reply; and in this way readers seeing both  at once will more easily determine where the truth lies; for I do not  engage in any case to make prolix replies, but only with perfect  frankness to avow my errors if I am convinced of them, or if I cannot  perceive them, simply to state what I think is required for defense of  the matters I have written, adding thereto no explication of any new  matte that it may not be necessary to pass without end from one thing  to another.    If some of the matters of which I have spoken in the beginning of the  \"Dioptrics\" and \"Meteorics\" should offend at first sight, because I  call them hypotheses and seem indifferent about giving proof of them, I  request a patient and attentive reading of the whole, from which I hope  those hesitating will derive satisfaction; for it appears to me that  the reasonings are so mutually connected in these treatises, that, as  the last are demonstrated by the first which are their causes, the  first are in their turn demonstrated by the last which are their  effects.  Nor must it be imagined that I here commit the fallacy which  the logicians call a circle; for since experience renders the majority  of these effects most certain, the causes from which I deduce them do  not serve so much to establish their reality as to explain their  existence; but on the contrary, the reality of the causes is  established by the reality of the effects.  Nor have I called them  hypotheses with any other end in view except that it may be known that  I think I am able to deduce them from those first truths which I have  already expounded; and yet that I have expressly determined not to do  so, to prevent a certain class of minds from thence taking occasion to  build some extravagant philosophy upon what they may take to be my  principles, and my being blamed for it.  I refer to those who imagine  that they can master in a day all that another has taken twenty years  to think out, as soon as he has spoken two or three words to them on  the subject; or who are the more liable to error and the less capable  of perceiving truth in very proportion as they are more subtle and  lively.  As to the opinions which are truly and wholly mine, I offer no  apology for them as new,--persuaded as I am that if their reasons be  well considered they will be found to be so simple and so conformed, to  common sense as to appear less extraordinary and less paradoxical than  any others which can be held on the same subjects; nor do I even boast  of being the earliest discoverer of any of them, but only of having  adopted them, neither because they had nor because they had not been  held by others, but solely because reason has convinced me of their  truth.    Though artisans may not be able at once to execute the invention which  is explained in the \"Dioptrics,\" I do not think that any one on that  account is entitled to condemn it; for since address and practice are  required in order so to make and adjust the machines described by me as  not to overlook the smallest particular, I should not be less  astonished if they succeeded on the first attempt than if a person were  in one day to become an accomplished performer on the guitar, by merely  having excellent sheets of music set up before him.  And if I write in  French, which is the language of my country, in preference to Latin,  which is that of my preceptors, it is because I expect that those who  make use of their unprejudiced natural reason will be better judges of  my opinions than those who give heed to the writings of the ancients  only; and as for those who unite good sense with habits of study, whom  alone I desire for judges, they will not, I feel assured, be so partial  to Latin as to refuse to listen to my reasonings merely because I  expound them in the vulgar tongue.    In conclusion, I am unwilling here to say anything very specific of the  progress which I expect to make for the future in the sciences, or to  bind myself to the public by any promise which I am not certain of  being able to fulfill; but this only will I say, that I have resolved  to devote what time I may still have to live to no other occupation  than that of endeavoring to acquire some knowledge of Nature, which  shall be of such a kind as to enable us therefrom to deduce rules in  medicine of greater certainty than those at present in use; and that my  inclination"]]]
