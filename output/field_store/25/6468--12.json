His dress and arms were splendid. He wore his national bonnet, crested  with a tuft of feathers, and with a Virgin Mary of massive silver for  a brooch. These brooches had been presented to the Scottish Guard, in  consequence of the King, in one of his fits of superstitions piety,  having devoted the swords of his guard to the service of the Holy  Virgin, and, as some say, carried the matter so far as to draw out a  commission to Our Lady as their Captain General. The Archer's gorget,  arm pieces, and gauntlets, were of the finest steel, curiously inlaid  with silver, and his hauberk, or shirt of mail, was as clear and bright  as the frostwork of a winter morning upon fern or brier. He wore a loose  surcoat or cassock of rich blue velvet, open at the sides like that of  a herald, with a large white St. Andrew's cross of embroidered silver  bisecting it both before and behind; his knees and legs were protected  by hose of mail and shoes of steel; a broad, strong poniard (called the  Mercy of God), hung by his right side; the baldric for his two handed  sword, richly embroidered, hung upon his left shoulder; but for  convenience he at present carried in his hand that unwieldy weapon which  the rules of his service forbade him to lay aside.    [St. Andrew was the first called to apostleship. He made many converts  to Christianity and was finally crucified on a cross of peculiar form,  which has since been called the St. Andrew's cross. Certain of his  relics were brought to Scotland in the fourth century, and he has since  that time been honoured as the patron saint of that country. He is also  the patron saint of the Burgundian Order, the Golden Fleece.]    Quentin Durward--though, like the Scottish youth of the period, he had  been early taught to look upon arms and war--thought he had never seen  a more martial looking, or more completely equipped and accomplished  man at arms than now saluted him in the person of his mother's brother,  called Ludovic with the Scar, or Le Balafre; yet he could not but shrink  a little from the grim expression of his countenance, while, with its  rough moustaches, he brushed first the one and then the other cheek of  his kinsman, welcomed his nephew to France, and, in the same breath,  asked what news from Scotland.    \"Little good tidings, dear uncle,\" replied young Durward; \"but I am glad  that you know me so readily.\"    \"I would have known thee, boy, in the landes of Bourdeaux, had I met  thee marching there like a crane on a pair of stilts [the crutches or  stilts which in Scotland are used to pass rivers. They are employed by  the peasantry of the country near Bordeaux to traverse those deserts of  loose sand called Landes. S]. But sit thee down--sit thee down--if there  is sorrow to hear of, we will have wine to make us bear it.--Ho! old  Pinch Measure, our good host, bring us of thy best, and that in an  instant.\"    The well known sound of the Scottish French was as familiar in  the taverns near Plessis as that of the Swiss French in the modern  guinguettes [common inns] of Paris; and promptly--ay, with the  promptitude of fear and precipitation, was it heard and obeyed. A flagon  of champagne stood before them, of which the elder took a draught, while  the nephew helped himself only to a moderate sip to acknowledge his  uncle's courtesy, saying, in excuse, that he had already drunk wine that  morning.    \"That had been a rare good apology in the mouth of thy sister, fair  nephew,\" said Le Balafre; \"you must fear the wine pot less, if you  would wear beard on your face, and write yourself soldier. But,  come--come--unbuckle your Scottish mail bag--give us the news of Glen  Houlakin--How doth my sister?\"    \"Dead, fair uncle,\" answered Quentin, sorrowfully.    \"Dead!\" echoed his uncle, with a tone rather marked by wonder than  sympathy,--\"why, she was five years younger than I, and I was never  better in my life. Dead! the thing is impossible. I have never had so  much as a headache, unless after revelling out of my two or three days'  furlough with the brethren of the joyous science--and my poor sister is  dead--And your father, fair nephew, hath he married again?\"    And, ere the youth could reply, he read the answer in his surprise at  the question, and said, \"What! no--I would have sworn that Allan  Durward was no man to live without a wife. He loved to have his house in  order--loved to look on a pretty woman too; and was somewhat strict in  life withal--matrimony did all this for him. Now, I care little about  these comforts, and I can look on a pretty woman without thinking on the  sacrament of wedlock--I am scarce holy enough for that.\"    \"Alas! dear uncle, my mother was left a widow a year since, when Glen  Houlakin was harried by the Ogilvies. My father, and my two uncles, and  my two elder brothers, and seven of my kinsmen, and the harper, and the  tasker, and some six more of our people, were killed in defending the  castle, and there is not a burning hearth or a standing stone in all  Glen Houlakin.\"    \"Cross of Saint Andrew!\" said Le Balafre; \"that is what I call an  onslaught! Ay, these Ogilvies were ever but sorry neighbours to Glen  Houlakin--an evil chance it was; but fate of war--fate of war.--When did  this mishap befall, fair nephew?\" With that he took a deep draught of  wine, and shook his head with much solemnity, when his kinsman replied  that his family had been destroyed upon the festival of Saint Jude  [October 28] last bypast.    \"Look ye there,\" said the soldier; \"I said it was all chance--on that  very day I and twenty of my comrades carried the Castle of Roche Noir by  storm, from Amaury Bras de fer, a captain of free lances, whom you must  have heard of. I killed him on his own threshold, and gained as much  gold as made this fair chain, which was once twice as long as it now  is--and that minds me to send part of it on an holy errand.--Here,  Andrew--Andrew!\"    Andrew, his yeoman, entered, dressed like the Archer himself in the  general equipment, but without the armour for the limbs--that of the  body more coarsely manufactured--his cap without a plume, and his  cassock made of serge, or ordinary cloth, instead of rich velvet.  Untwining his gold chain from his neck, Balafre twisted off, with his  firm and strong set teeth, about four inches from the one end of it,  and said to his attendant, \"Here, Andrew, carry this to my gossip, jolly  Father Boniface, the monk of St. Martin's; greet him well from me, by  the same token that he could not say God save ye when we last parted at  midnight.--Tell my gossip that my brother and sister, and some others of  my house, are all dead and gone, and I pray him to say masses for their  souls as far as the value of these links will carry him, and to do on  trust what else may be necessary to free them from Purgatory. And hark  ye, as they were just living people, and free from all heresy, it may  be that they are well nigh out of limbo already, so that a little matter  may have them free of the fetlocks; and in that case, look ye, ye  will say I desire to take out the balance of the gold in curses upon a  generation called the Ogilvies of Angus Shire, in what way soever the  church may best come at them. You understand all this, Andrew?\"    The coutelier nodded.    \"Then look that none of the links find their way to the wine house ere  the monk touches them; for if it so chance, thou shalt taste of saddle  girth and stirrup leather till thou art as raw as Saint Bartholomew [he  was flayed alive. In Michael Angelo's Last Judgment he is represented as  holding his skin in his hand]--Yet hold, I see thy eye has fixed on the  wine measure, and thou shalt not go without tasting.\"    So saying, he filled him a brimful cup, which the coutelier drank off,  and retired to do his patron's commission.    \"And now, fair nephew, let us hear what was your own fortune in this  unhappy matter.\"    \"I fought it out among those who were older and stouter than I was, till  we were all brought down,\" said Durward, \"and I received a cruel wound.\"    \"Not a worse slash than I received ten years since myself,\" said Le  Balafre. \"Look at this, now, my fair nephew,\" tracing the dark crimson  gash which was imprinted on his face.--\"An Ogilvy's sword never ploughed  so deep a furrow.\"    \"They ploughed deep enough,\" answered Quentin, sadly, \"but they were  tired at last, and my mother's entreaties procured mercy for me, when I  was found to retain some spark of life; but although a learned monk of  Aberbrothik, who chanced to be our guest at the fatal time, and narrowly  escaped being killed in the fray, was permitted to bind my wounds, and  finally to remove me to a place of safety, it was only on promise, given  both by my mother and him, that I should become a monk.\"    \"A monk!\" exclaimed the uncle. \"Holy Saint Andrew! that is what never  befell me. No one, from my childhood upwards, ever so much as dreamed  of making me a monk. And yet I wonder when I think of it; for you will  allow that, bating the reading and writing, which I could never learn,  and the psalmody, which I could never endure, and the dress, which is  that of a mad beggar--Our Lady forgive me! [here he crossed himself] and  their fasts, which do not suit my appetite, I would have made every whit  as good a monk as my little gossip at St. Martin's yonder. But I know  not why, none ever proposed the station to me.--Oh, so, fair nephew, you  were to be a monk, then--and wherefore, I pray you?\"    \"That my father's house might be ended, either in the cloister or in the  tomb,\" answered Quentin, with deep feeling.    \"I see,\" answered his uncle--\"I comprehend. Cunning rogues--very  cunning!

Ye first-born beings, ye are  displayed in this wondrous universe of five elements! I desire to obtain  you by the help of the knowledge derived from hearing, and of meditation,  for ye are Infinite! Ye are the course itself of Nature and intelligent  Soul that pervades that course! Ye are birds of beauteous feathers perched  on the body that is like to a tree! Ye are without the three common  attributes of every soul! Ye are incomparable! Ye, through your spirit in  every created thing, pervade the Universe!    \"'Ye are golden Eagles! Ye are the essence into which all things disappear!  Ye are free from error and know no deterioration! Ye are of beauteous  beaks that would not unjustly strike and are victorious in every  encounter! Ye certainly prevail over time! Having created the sun, ye  weave the wondrous cloth of the year by means of the white thread of the  day and the black thread of the night! And with the cloth so woven, ye  have established two courses of action appertaining respectively to the  Devas and the Pitris. The bird of Life seized by Time which represents the  strength of the Infinite soul, ye set free for delivering her unto great  happiness! They that are in deep ignorance, as long as they are under  delusions of their senses, suppose you, who are independent of the  attributes of matter, to be gifted with form! Three hundred and sixty cows  represented by three hundred and sixty days produce one calf between them  which is the year. That calf is the creator and destroyer of all. Seekers  of truth following different routes, draw the milk of true knowledge with  its help. Ye Aswins, ye are the creators of that calf!    \"'The year is but the nave of a wheel to which is attached seven hundred  and twenty spokes representing as many days and nights. The circumference  of this wheel represented by twelve months is without end. This wheel is  full of delusions and knows no deterioration. It affects all creatures  whether to this or of the other worlds. Ye Aswins, this wheel of time is  set in motion by you!    \"'The wheel of Time as represented by the year has a nave represented by  the six seasons. The number of spokes attached to that nave is twelve as  represented by the twelve signs of the Zodiac. This wheel of Time  manifests the fruits of the acts of all things. The presiding deities of  Time abide in that wheel. Subject as I am to its distressful influence, ye  Aswins, liberate me from that wheel of Time. Ye Aswins, ye are this  universe of five elements! Ye are the objects that are enjoyed in this and  in the other world! Make me independent of the five elements! And though  ye are the Supreme Brahma, yet ye move over the Earth in forms enjoying  the delights that the senses afford.    \"'In the beginning, ye created the ten points of the universe! Then have ye  placed the Sun and the Sky above! The Rishis, according to the course of  the same Sun, perform their sacrifices, and the gods and men, according to  what hath been appointed for them, perform their sacrifices also enjoying  the fruits of those acts!    \"'Mixing the three colours, ye have produced all the objects of sight! It  is from these objects that the Universe hath sprung whereon the gods and  men are engaged in their respective occupations, and, indeed, all  creatures endued with life!    \"'Ye Aswins, I adore you! I also adore the Sky which is your handiwork! Ye  are the ordainers of the fruits of all acts from which even the gods are  not free! Ye are yourselves free from the fruits of your acts!    \"'Ye are the parents of all! As males and females it is ye that swallow the  food which subsequently develops into the life creating fluid and blood!  The new-born infant sucks the teat of its mother. Indeed it is ye that  take the shape of the infant! Ye Aswins, grant me my sight to protect my  life!'    \"The twin Aswins, thus invoked, appeared and said, 'We are satisfied. Here  is a cake for thee. Take and eat it.' And Upamanyu thus addressed, replied,  'Your words, O Aswins, have never proved untrue. But without first  offering this cake to my preceptor I dare not take it.' And the Aswins  thereupon told him, 'Formerly, thy preceptor had invoked us. We thereupon  gave him a cake like this; and he took it without offering it to his  master. Do thou do that which thy preceptor did.' Thus addressed, Upamanyu  again said unto them, 'O Aswins, I crave your pardon. Without offering it  to my preceptor I dare not apply this cake.' The Aswins then said, 'O, we  are pleased with this devotion of thine to thy preceptor. Thy master's  teeth are of black iron. Thine shall be of gold. Thou shall be restored to  sight and shall have good fortune.'    \"Thus spoken to by the Aswins he recovered his sight, and having gone to  his preceptor's presence he saluted him and told him all. And his  preceptor was well-pleased with him and said unto him, 'Thou shalt obtain  prosperity even as the Aswins have said. All the Vedas shall shine in thee  and all the Dharma-sastras.' And this was the trial of Upamanyu.    \"Then Veda the other disciple of Ayoda-Dhaumya was called. His preceptor  once addressed him, saying, 'Veda, my child, tarry some time in my house  and serve thy preceptor. It shall be to thy profit.' And Veda having  signified his assent tarried long in the family of his preceptor mindful  of serving him. Like an ox under the burthens of his master, he bore heat  and cold, hunger and thirst, at all times without a murmur. And it was not  long before his preceptor was satisfied. And as a consequence of that  satisfaction, Veda obtained good fortune and universal knowledge. And this  was the trial of Veda.    \"And Veda, having received permission from his preceptor, and leaving the  latter's residence after the completion of his studies, entered the  domestic mode of life. And while living in his own house, he got three  pupils. And he never told them to perform any work or to obey implicitly  his own behests; for having himself experienced much woe while abiding in  the family of his preceptor, he liked not to treat them with severity.    \"After a certain time, Janamejaya and Paushya, both of the order of  Kshatriyas, arriving at his residence appointed the Brahman, Veda, as  their spiritual guide (Upadhyaya). And one day while about to depart upon  some business related to a sacrifice, he employed one of his disciples,  Utanka, to take charge of his household. 'Utanka', said he, 'whatsoever  should have to be done in my house, let it be done by thee without  neglect.' And having given these orders to Utanka, he went on his journey.    \"So Utanka always mindful of the injunction of his preceptor took up his  abode in the latter's house. And while Utanka was residing there, the  females of his preceptor's house having assembled addressed him and said,  'O Utanka, thy mistress is in that season when connubial connection might  be fruitful. The preceptor is absent; then stand thou in his place and do  the needful.' And Utanka, thus addressed, said unto those women, 'It is  not proper for me to do this at the bidding of women. I have not been  enjoined by my preceptor to do aught that is improper.'    \"After a while, his preceptor returned from his journey. And his preceptor  having learnt all that had happened, became well-pleased and, addressing  Utanka, said, 'Utanka, my child, what favour shall I bestow on thee? I  have been served by thee duly; therefore hath our friendship for each  other increased. I therefore grant thee leave to depart. Go thou, and let  thy wishes be accomplished!'    \"Utanka, thus addressed, replied, saying, 'Let me do something that you  wish, for it hath been said, \"He who bestoweth instruction contrary to  usage and he who receiveth it contrary to usage, one of the two dieth, and  enmity springeth up between the two.\" I, therefore, who have received thy  leave to depart, am desirous of bringing thee some honorarium due to a  preceptor.' His master, upon hearing this, replied, 'Utanka, my child, wait  a while.' Sometime after, Utanka again addressed his preceptor, saying,  'Command me to bring that for honorarium, which you desire.' And his  preceptor then said, 'My dear Utanka, thou hast often told me of your  desire to bring something by way of acknowledgment for the instruction  thou hast received. Go then in and ask thy mistress what thou art to bring.  And bring thou that which she directs.' And thus directed by his preceptor  Utanka addressed his preceptress, saying, 'Madam, I have obtained my  master's leave to go home, and I am desirous of bringing something  agreeable to thee as honorarium for the instruction I have received, in  order that I may not depart as his debtor. Therefore, please command me  what I am to bring.' Thus addressed, his preceptress replied, 'Go unto  King Paushya and beg of him the pair of ear-rings worn by his Queen, and  bring them hither. The fourth day hence is a sacred day when I wish to  appear before the Brahmanas (who may dine at my house) decked with these  ear-rings. Then accomplish this, O Utanka! If thou shouldst succeed, good  fortune shall attend thee; if not, what good canst thou expect?'    \"Utanka thus commanded, took his departure. And as he was passing along  the road he saw a bull of extraordinary size and a man of uncommon stature  mounted thereon. And that man addressed Utanka and said, 'Eat thou of the  dung of this bull.' Utanka, however, was unwilling to comply. The man said  again, 'O Utanka, eat of it without scrutiny. Thy master ate of it before.'  And Utanka signified his assent and ate of the dung and drank of the  urine of that bull, and rose respectfully, and washing his hands and mouth  went to where King Paushya was.    \"On arriving at the palace, Utanka saw Paushya seated (on his throne).
