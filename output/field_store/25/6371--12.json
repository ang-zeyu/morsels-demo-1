And he knew that he must choose between two alternatives--either he must  never go to the orchard again, or he must go as an avowed lover to woo  him a wife.    Worldly prudence, his inheritance from a long line of thrifty,  cool-headed ancestors, was strong in Eric, and he did not yield easily  or speedily to the dictates of his passion. All night he struggled  against the new emotions that threatened to sweep away the \"common  sense\" which David Baker had bade him take with him when he went  a-wooing. Would not a marriage with Kilmeny Gordon be an unwise thing  from any standpoint?    Then something stronger and greater and more vital than wisdom or  unwisdom rose up in him and mastered him. Kilmeny, beautiful, dumb  Kilmeny was, as he had once involuntarily thought, \"the one maid\" for  him. Nothing should part them. The mere idea of never seeing her again  was so unbearable that he laughed at himself for having counted it a  possible alternative.    \"If I can win Kilmeny's love I shall ask her to be my wife,\" he said,  looking out of the window to the dark, southwestern hill beyond which  lay his orchard.    The velvet sky over it was still starry; but the water of the harbour  was beginning to grow silvery in the reflection of the dawn that was  breaking in the east.    \"Her misfortune will only make her dearer to me. I cannot realize that a  month ago I did not know her. It seems to me that she has been a part of  my life for ever. I wonder if she was grieved that I did not go to the  orchard last night--if she waited for me. If she does, she does not know  it herself yet. It will be my sweet task to teach her what love means,  and no man has ever had a lovelier, purer, pupil.\"    At the annual school meeting, the next afternoon, the trustees asked  Eric to take the Lindsay school for the following year. He consented  unhesitatingly.    That evening he went to Mrs. Williamson, as she washed her tea dishes in  the kitchen.    \"Mrs. Williamson, I am going back to the old Connors orchard to see  Kilmeny again to-night.\"    She looked at him reproachfully.    \"Well, Master, I have no more to say. I suppose it wouldn't be of any  use if I had. But you know what I think of it.\"    \"I intend to marry Kilmeny Gordon if I can win her.\"    An expression of amazement came into the good woman's face. She looked  scrutinizingly at the firm mouth and steady gray eyes for a moment. Then  she said in a troubled voice,    \"Do you think that is wise, Master? I suppose Kilmeny is pretty; the egg  peddler told me she was; and no doubt she is a good, nice girl. But she  wouldn't be a suitable wife for you--a girl that can't speak.\"    \"That doesn't make any difference to me.\"    \"But what will your people say?\"    \"I have no 'people' except my father. When he sees Kilmeny he will  understand. She is all the world to me, Mrs. Williamson.\"    \"As long as you believe that there is nothing more to be said,\" was  the quiet answer, \"I'd be a little bit afraid if I was you, though. But  young people never think of those things.\"    \"My only fear is that she won't care for me,\" said Eric soberly.    Mrs. Williamson surveyed the handsome, broad-shouldered young man  shrewdly.    \"I don't think there are many women would say you 'no', Master. I wish  you well in your wooing, though I can't help thinking you're doing  a daft-like thing. I hope you won't have any trouble with Thomas and  Janet. They are so different from other folks there is no knowing. But  take my advice, Master, and go and see them about it right off. Don't go  on meeting Kilmeny unbeknownst to them.\"    \"I shall certainly take your advice,\" said Eric, gravely. \"I should have  gone to them before. It was merely thoughtlessness on my part. Possibly  they do know already. Kilmeny may have told them.\"    Mrs. Williamson shook her head decidedly.    \"No, no, Master, she hasn't. They'd never have let her go on meeting  you there if they had known. I know them too well to think of that for a  moment. Go you straight to them and say to them just what you have said  to me. That is your best plan, Master. And take care of Neil. People say  he has a notion of Kilmeny himself. He'll do you a bad turn if he can,  I've no doubt. Them foreigners can't be trusted--and he's just as much  a foreigner as his parents before him--though he HAS been brought up on  oatmeal and the shorter catechism, as the old saying has it. I feel that  somehow--I always feel it when I look at him singing in the choir.\"    \"Oh, I am not afraid of Neil,\" said Eric carelessly. \"He couldn't help  loving Kilmeny--nobody could.\"    \"I suppose every young man thinks that about his girl--if he's the right  sort of young man,\" said Mrs. Williamson with a little sigh.    She watched Eric out of sight anxiously.    \"I hope it'll all come out right,\" she thought. \"I hope he ain't making  an awful mistake--but--I'm afraid. Kilmeny must be very pretty to have  bewitched him so. Well, I suppose there is no use in my worrying over  it. But I do wish he had never gone back to that old orchard and seen  her.\"        CHAPTER XI. A LOVER AND HIS LASS    Kilmeny was in the orchard when Eric reached it, and he lingered for a  moment in the shadow of the spruce wood to dream over her beauty.    The orchard had lately overflowed in waves of old-fashioned caraway, and  she was standing in the midst of its sea of bloom, with the lace-like  blossoms swaying around her in the wind. She wore the simple dress of  pale blue print in which he had first seen her; silk attire could not  better have become her loveliness. She had woven herself a chaplet  of half open white rosebuds and placed it on her dark hair, where the  delicate blossoms seemed less wonderful than her face.    When Eric stepped through the gap she ran to meet him with outstretched  hands, smiling. He took her hands and looked into her eyes with an  expression before which hers for the first time faltered. She looked  down, and a warm blush strained the ivory curves of her cheek and  throat. His heart bounded, for in that blush he recognized the banner of  love's vanguard.    \"Are you glad to see me, Kilmeny?\" he asked, in a low significant tone.    She nodded, and wrote in a somewhat embarrassed fashion,    \"Yes. Why do you ask? You know I am always glad to see you. I was afraid  you would not come. You did not come last night and I was so sorry.  Nothing in the orchard seemed nice any longer. I couldn't even play. I  tried to, and my violin only cried. I waited until it was dark and then  I went home.\"    \"I am sorry you were disappointed, Kilmeny. I couldn't come last night.  Some day I shall tell you why. I stayed home to learn a new lesson. I am  sorry you missed me--no, I am glad. Can you understand how a person may  be glad and sorry for the same thing?\"    She nodded again, with a return of her usual sweet composure.    \"Yes, I could not have understood once, but I can now. Did you learn  your new lesson?\"    \"Yes, very thoroughly. It was a delightful lesson when I once understood  it. I must try to teach it to you some day. Come over to the old bench,  Kilmeny. There is something I want to say to you. But first, will you  give me a rose?\"    She ran to the bush, and, after careful deliberation, selected a perfect  half-open bud and brought it to him--a white bud with a faint, sunrise  flush about its golden heart.    \"Thank you. It is as beautiful as--as a woman I know,\" Eric said.    A wistful look came into her face at his words, and she walked with a  drooping head across the orchard to the bench.    \"Kilmeny,\" he said, seriously, \"I am going to ask you to do something  for me. I want you to take me home with you and introduce me to your  uncle and aunt.\"    She lifted her head and stared at him incredulously, as if he had asked  her to do something wildly impossible. Understanding from his grave face  that he meant what he said, a look of dismay dawned in her eyes. She  shook her head almost violently and seemed to be making a passionate,  instinctive effort to speak. Then she caught up her pencil and wrote  with feverish haste:    \"I cannot do that. Do not ask me to. You do not understand. They would  be very angry. They do not want to see any one coming to the house. And  they would never let me come here again. Oh, you do not mean it?\"    He pitied her for the pain and bewilderment in her eyes; but he took her  slender hands in his and said firmly,    \"Yes, Kilmeny, I do mean it. It is not quite right for us to be meeting  each other here as we have been doing, without the knowledge and consent  of your friends. You cannot now understand this, but--believe me--it is  so.\"    She looked questioningly, pityingly into his eyes. What she read there  seemed to convince her, for she turned very pale and an expression of  hopelessness came into her face. Releasing her hands, she wrote slowly,    \"If you say it is wrong I must believe it. I did not know anything so  pleasant could be wrong. But if it is wrong we must not meet here any  more. Mother told me I must never do anything that was wrong. But I did  not know this was wrong.\"    \"It was not wrong for you, Kilmeny. But it was a little wrong for me,  because I knew better--or rather, should have known better. I didn't  stop to think, as the children say. Some day you will understand fully.  Now, you will take me to your uncle and aunt, and after I have said  to them what I want to say it will be all right for us to meet here or  anywhere.\"    She shook her head.    \"No,\" she wrote, \"Uncle Thomas and Aunt Janet will tell you to go away  and never come back. And they will never let me come here any more.  Since it is not right to meet you I will not come, but it is no use to  think of going to them. I did not tell them about you because I knew  that they would forbid me to see you, but I am sorry, since it is so  wrong.\"    \"You must take me to them,\" said Eric firmly. \"I am quite sure that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53416"],[0,"Only a Girl's Love (#13)"],[1,"it was,  he painted and played for amusement only, and there were only a few of  his friends, and only those who were most intimate, who suspected that  the wild, reckless Leycester could do more than ride like a centaur and  shoot like a North American Indian. How were they to know, seeing that  he rarely spoke of art, and never of his own passionate love of it? Had  they known, it would have given them a key to much in his character  which puzzled and bewildered them; they would have been nearer  understanding how it was that in one man could be combined the soft  tenderness of a southern nature with the resolute, defiant recklessness  of the northern.    He entered the room and went to the fireplace in which a log was  burning brightly, to guard against the too frequent treachery of an  early summer evening, and flinging his hat on to a chair, passed his  hand through his hair with a thoughtful yet restless smile.    \"Stella!\" he murmured. \"Stella! That was wrong. A star should be fair  and golden, all light and sunshine, while she--great Heaven! what eyes!  It was surely the sweetest, loveliest face that a man ever looked upon.  No wonder that coming upon it so suddenly--with my thoughts a hundred  miles away, coming upon it suddenly as it shone up above me--that I  should think it only a vision! If that face as I saw it could smile  out from the Academy next Spring, what crowds of fools would gather  round to gape and stare at it? If--yes, but who could do it? No one! No  one! As well try and catch the sunlight on a brush and paint it on the  canvas--as well try----\" he broke off suddenly, his eye caught by the  Venus Aphrodite smiling from the easel, and going across to it, stood  and contemplated it.    \"Venus with a pale pink face and meaningless blue eyes, with insipid  yellow hair and simpering smile! Never more will Venus take that  semblance for me. No, she will be as I saw her to-night, with dark  silken hair, and sweeping lashes shading the dark brown eyes, in which  one sees the soul peering from their depths. That is Venus, not this,\"  and with a smile of derision he took up a brush and drew a dark, broad  effacing line across the fair face.    \"So departs forever all my former dreams of womanly loveliness.  Loveliness! I have never seen it until to-night. Stella! A star! Yes,  she is rightly named, after all. She shone down on me like a star,  and I--great Heaven!--was like one bewitched! While she--she made a  laughing-stock of me. Compared me with the nag, and treated me like a  school-boy too big to be whipped but not too large to be laughed at.    \"By Jove it is not a thing to be proud of; called to task by a girl--a  little slip of a girl not yet a woman! and yet I would not have missed  that laugh and the light scorn of those dark eyes, though they lighted  up at my expense. Stella----\"    There was a knock at the door, and his valet, Oliver, entered.    Lord Leycester stared at him a moment abstractedly, then roused himself  from his reverie.    \"What is it, Oliver?\"    \"You sent for me, my lord.\"    \"Oh, yes! I had forgotten. I will wash and get into my other coat.\"    Oliver passed noiselessly into the other room and assisted his master  to change the velvet smoking-jacket for the dress coat, brushed the  thick, short-cut chestnut hair into order, and opened the door.    \"Where are they all?\" he asked. \"Are any of them in the smoking-room?\"    \"Yes, my lord, Lord Barton and Captain Halliday; the Marquis of  Sandford and Sir William are in the billiard-room.\"    Lord Leycester nodded, and went down the stairs across the hall;  a servant drew a curtain aside and opened a door, and Lord  Leycester entered a small ante-room, one side of which opened into  a long-stretching fernery, from which came the soft trip trip of  fountains, and the breath which filled the whole atmosphere with a  tropical perfume.    A couple of footmen in gorgeous livery were standing beside a double  curtain, and at a sign from Lord Leycester they drew it apart. Lord  Leycester passed through and down a small corridor lined with statuary,  at the end of which was another curtain. No passage, or door, or  ante-room but was thus masked, to shut out the two things which the  earl held as abominations--draught and noise.    With the opening of these curtains the large saloon was revealed  like the scene on the stage of a theater. It was a magnificent room  in keeping with the rest of the place, richly but not gorgeously  decorated, and lighted by wax candles shining through faintly hued  globes. At one end stood a grand piano in white and ormolu, and a lady  was playing and singing, while others were standing round with tea-cups  in their hands. Near the fireplace was a table, upon which stood a  silver tea equipage, with which the countess was busied.    Lady Wyndward was still in her prime, notwithstanding that Lord  Leycester was twenty-three; she had been married at eighteen, and was  now in the perfection of matronly beauty; one had only to glance at  her to learn from whence Leycester had got his strange beauty. Near  her stood a tall, thin gentleman with proud, haughty, clean-cut face,  and iron gray hair, worn rather long and brushed back from a white,  lofty brow. It was the earl. His dark piercing eyes were bent upon the  ground as he stood listening to the music, but he saw Leycester enter,  and raised his head as a slight frown crossed his face. Lady Wyndward  saw the frown and sought the cause, but her face showed no signs of  surprise or displeasure. It was calm and impassive at all times, as if  its owner disdained the weakness of ordinary mortals. Leycester paused  a moment, taking in the scene; then he crossed the room, and went up to  the table.    Lady Wyndward looked up with her serene, imperial smile.    \"Will you have some tea, Leycester?\"    \"Thanks,\" he said.    She gave him his cup, and as he took it a young man left the group at  the piano, and came up to him laughing.    \"Where have you been, Leycester?\" he asked, putting his hand on the  broad shoulder. It was Lord Charles Guildford, Leycester's most  intimate friend.    Between these two existed an affection which was almost, say rather  more than fraternal. They had been together at Eton, where Leycester,  the great, stalwart lad, had fought the slight frail boy's battles;  they had lived in the same rooms at Oxford, had been comrades in all  the wild escapades which made their term at college a notorious one,  and they were inseparable. Leycester had grown from a tall lad into a  stalwart man; Lord Charles--or Charlie, as he was called--had fulfilled  the promise of his frail boyhood, and developed into a slight, thin,  fair-haired youth, with the indolent grace which sometimes accompanies  weakness, and the gentle nature of a woman.    Leycester turned to him with a smile, and the earl looked up to hear  the answer; the countess busied herself with the teapot, as if she were  not listening as intently.    \"I went for a galop, Charlie,\" said Leycester. \"You fellows were half  asleep in the smoking-room, and I had listened to Barton's Indian story  for the hundredth time, and it got rather slow; then I remembered that  the chestnut had been eating his head off for the last five weeks, and  thought I would give him a turn.\"    The earl frowned and turned away; Lord Charles laughed.    \"Pretty behavior!\" he exclaimed; \"and here were we hunting all over the  place for you.\"    \"Why didn't you come into the drawing-room to us, Lord Leycester?\" said  a beautiful girl who was sitting near; \"we should not have bored you  with any Indian stories.\"    \"But, you see, I should have bored you, Lady Constance,\" he said.    The girl smiled up into his face.    \"Perhaps you would,\" she said. \"You are more considerate than I  thought.\"    \"I never venture into the ladies' sanctum after dinner till the tea is  announced,\" he retorted. \"I have an idea, shared by my sex generally,  that it is not safe--that, in short, you are too ferocious.\"    \"And you prefer riding about the country till we quiet down. Are we  quiet now, or do we look ferocious?\"    And she smiled up at him from behind her fan with a plain invitation.    He sat down beside her and began to talk the infinite nothings which  came to his lips so easily, the trivial small change which his musical  voice and rare smile seemed to transform to true coin; but while he  talked his thoughts were wandering to the dark-haired girl who had  shone down upon him from her green and fragrant bower in the lane, and  he found himself picturing her in the little room at the cottage in the  meadows, amongst the curious litter of the old artist's studio; and  gradually his answers grew disjointed and inconsequential.    He got up presently, got up abruptly, and wandered across the room  stopping to exchange a word or two with one and the other, his tall,  graceful figure towering above those of the other men, his handsome  head thrown back musingly. Many an admiring and wistful glance  followed him from among the women, and not a few would have exerted  all their fascinations to keep him by their side, had they not known  by experience, that when he was in his present mood he was deaf to the  voice and smile of the charmer, charmed she never so wisely.          CHAPTER IV.      The countess watched him from her table, and, looking up at the earl,  murmured:    \"Leycester is in one of his restless moods to-night.\"    \"Yes,\" he said, with a sigh. \"What is it?--do you know?\"    \"No,\" she said, calmly. \"He was all right at dinner.\"    \"Why can he not behave like other people?\" said the earl, sadly. \"Can  you fancy any other man leaving his father's guests and riding about  the country?\"    \"Leycester never was like any other,\" she said, not without a touch of  pride. \"He is as he is, and nothing can alter him.\"    The earl was silent for a moment, his long white hands folded behind  his back, his dark eyes"]]]
