Before he had reached this elevated position he had heard a deep rumbling  sound in the distance--a sound which seemed like the whirl and rush of  angry waters, as if he was approaching a high cataract.    Ere he had gained the extreme top of the elevation, however, this noise  suddenly died away, and the calmness of the primeval wilderness lay on the  scene as he paused on the summit to gaze into the valley.    Naturally his gaze had turned in that direction, and an exclamation of  astonishment left his lips, as he saw that the valley was gone!    The great basin was filled with water, the high hills and mountains  forming a mighty rim with a piece of the huge bowl broken away where the  gap existed in the elevated range on the north. But another feature of  this inland lake had greater interest for him.    Near its centre was a small, barren island, entirely destitute of growth  except for a solitary tree standing on its highest point.    The lonely monarch stood stark and stern in all its solitude, with one  branch lifted like a skeleton arm pointing toward the north.    \"The pimento--the treasure island!\" exclaimed Jack with suppressed  emotion.    The longer he looked upon the little island and its surroundings the more  fully convinced he became that it was the spot described in the paper he  had found so singularly on Robinson Crusoe's island.    When he had recovered somewhat from his glad surprise he urged the pony  down the rough descent until the shore of the lake was reached.    \"Oh, Don!\" he said to the faithful pony, \"you must take me to the island,\"  never dreaming of the effort it would cost.    As he spoke a commotion began in the water at the north end, though that  in front of him was still as unruffled as ever. But the pony had barely  plunged into the tide before a deep, guttural sound came up from the  depths and long lines of foam appeared on the surface.    Nothing daunted by this, Jack continued to urge the animal ahead in spite  of its desire to turn back, until they were about midway between the bank  which they had left and the island.    The strange noise had increased so that now it completely filled Jack's  ears, while the water was in a fearful state of agitation. It had taken on  a peculiar greenish hue, with big flecks of white foam, and here and there  were fountains spouting up bright yellow liquid, which rose to the height  of from ten to twenty feet.    The youth felt a strong undercurrent, and, finding that he could not reach  the island, he tried to get back to the shore he had left.    By this time the pony was struggling helplessly in the mysterious power  sucking it downward.    Then, before Jack could clear his feet from the stirrups, so as to look  out for himself, he was drawn under the seething waters with his horse!          Chapter XVI    At the Boiling Lake        As Jack felt the swirling waters closing over him, he made greater effort  to keep on the surface.    His gallant pony was struggling furiously for the same purpose, but the  power pulling them down was irresistible.    A continual roaring filled his ears, and it seemed as if he was being  drawn into some infernal region.    In spite of all he could do he was carried downward, until suddenly he  felt a terrible shock, as if he had been hurled against some stony  surface, and the next he knew he was floating on the water near the north  end of the lake, which was then quite tranquil. He had no difficulty in  swimming to the nearest point of land.    Scrambling up the precipitous bank he was glad to sink upon the ground for  rest.    He was wondering if his pony had perished, when he was gladdened by the  sight of the animal on the opposite side of the lake.    Before going to the horse Jack resolved to try to swim out to the island,  and as the water had now assumed the calmness which had prevailed at the  time he had first seen it, he did not think of further trouble. He had  received some bruises from his recent experience, but beyond them he felt  little the worse for his adventure.    Removing his outer garments, so as to give greater freedom to his  movements, he stepped down to the edge of the dark flood, which was filled  with the fine particles of earth it had swallowed.    As calm as the water was then, he had barely touched it with one foot  before a shriek, which rang in his ears for a long time afterwards, rang  high and far, cut short in its midst by a fearful rush of the aroused  flood, and a column was suddenly thrown into the air to the height of a  hundred feet!    It was such a terrific, appalling outburst that he hastily clambered back  upon the bank, to watch the strange sight. For fully two minutes the  waterspout quivered and vibrated in the air, when it collapsed as abruptly  as it had appeared.    The water of the lake continued to boil for five minutes, when it began to  subside, though bearing traces of agitation for five minutes longer,  during which Jack watched it with intense interest.    Still undaunted by this marvelous display, Jack resolved to try a third  time to reach the island, selecting a more favorable place for his descent  into the water this time.    As no outbreak had immediately followed his entrance into the lake this  time, he was beginning to think that the strange phenomenon was over. But  he was soon to be undeceived.    All at once, without warning, a dozen columns of water sprang upward,  threatening for a moment to drain the lake dry, and among these rushing,  writhing pillars Jack was borne into the air.    When the powers subsided he fell back with such a force as to render him  almost senseless. The lake was still churned and convulsed by the mighty  agency controlling it, and he had a hard fight to reach the shore, where  he lay completely exhausted.    Slowly recovering his strength he finally sat up and began to wring the  water out of his clothes, deciding to leave the place as soon as he felt  able. The water was calm then; though a short time before it had been  tossed and whipped into fury by the mysterious element controlling it.    \"Were the whole Incas treasure buried on that island it would be safe from  the hand of the despoiler,\" he said, speaking aloud his thoughts. \"But I  do not understand it. I am willing to wager that this is the same valley I  saw when I was this way before, though it was as dry as a palm leaf then.  How calm it is now, but I suppose if I should dare to enter its sacred  precinct it would begin again its fearful convulsions.\"    As he finished speaking, Jack picked up a small stone and tossed it into  the lake. No sooner had it disappeared beneath its dark surface than  another column of water shot upward with a sort of hissing that was  terrific, and in a moment the whole body was once more undergoing a series  of spasms frightful to behold.    Watching it until the outbreak was over, Jack lost no further time in  seeking the pony. Then he began to climb the hillside leading from the  place.    Upon the crest he paused for a last look, saying:    \"It is calm enough now. Sometime I will come again, for I will know its  secret if I die for it. There is and must be a natural explanation for all  this.\"    Finding Plum Plucky waiting anxiously for him at the expected place of  meeting, Jack led the way toward civilization, having come to the  conclusion to close the trade on one of the nitrate beds he had seen and  begin operations as soon as possible.    He said nothing to his companion of his experience in the valley of  mystery, partly because the stirring scenes immediately following caused  him to put it in the background of his memory for a while.    He was the more anxious to get his first cargo of nitrate off as the war  cloud was deepening fast, and not only was Peru and Chili at a state of  bitter antagonism, but Bolivia was threatening to mix in the trouble. A  three-cornered war, with Southern Peru for its battleground, was anything  but what he desired to see.    The next day he bought his first nitrate bed, paying for it forty  pistoles, which was considerably more than he had expected, but it was  large, and if his plans only worked he believed there was a small fortune  in it.    He then hired oxen enough to make two six-ox teams, with suitable wagons  to draw the nitrate on, and he engaged the services of half a dozen  Peruvians to help in the work of getting out the first loads.    As the bed lay remote from the few beaten paths of the thinly populated  country, it would involve considerable hard work and time to get passable  roads cut through, so as to be able to draw loads of any size.    \"By gosh!\" drawled Plum Plucky, as they set out on their work, \"I'm going  to stand by yeou; but yeou may hang my hat on a scare-crow if I don't  think yeou'll blow yerself dry.\"    \"By that I suppose you mean that I shall lose all I am putting into my  venture,\" said Jack, good-naturedly.    \"That's just what I mean. I'll bet yeou have got about every dollar yeou  have into it now.\"    \"I have figured up that I shall have about twenty pounds left when I have  paid off my help.\"    \"Say, Jack! I'd like to be there when you get in with yer first load of  dirt and see 'em laugh. Don't s'pose yeou have any dirt in the teown yeou  come from.\"    \"Not dirt that is pure nitrate of soda, and possessing the highest  qualities for fertilization of any known compound. Hello! what is up now?\"          Chapter XVII    In the Nitrate Fields        The last exclamation was called from Jack by the fact that the teams had  suddenly stopped,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#13)"],[1,"ttic!  K., at the bank, had a big office with an  ante-room, and had an enormous window through which he could look down  at the activity in the square.  It was true, though, that he had no  secondary income from bribes and fraud, and he couldn't tell a servant  to bring him a woman up to the office on his arm.  K., however, was  quite willing to do without such things, in this life at least.  K. was  still looking at the notice when a man came up the stairs, looked  through the open door into the living room where it was also possible to  see the courtroom, and finally asked K. whether he had just seen a woman  there.  \"You're the court usher, aren't you?\" asked K.  \"That's right,\"  said the man, \"oh, yes, you're defendant K., I recognise you now as  well.  Nice to see you here.\"  And he offered K. his hand, which was far  from what K. had expected.  And when K. said nothing, he added, \"There's  no court session planned for today, though.\"  \"I know that,\" said K. as  he looked at the usher's civilian coat which, beside its ordinary  buttons, displayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office and  seemed to have been taken from an old army officer's coat.  \"I was  speaking with your wife a little while ago.  She is no longer here.  The  student has carried her off to the examining judge.\"  \"Listen to this,\"  said the usher, \"they're always carrying her away from me.  It's Sunday  today, and it's not part of my job to do any work today, but they send  me off with some message which isn't even necessary just to get me away  from here.  What they do is they send me off not too far away so that I  can still hope to get back on time if I really hurry.  So off I go  running as fast as I can, shout the message through the crack in the  door of the office I've been sent to, so out of breath they'll hardly be  able to understand it, run back here again, but the student's been even  faster than I have - well he's got less far to go, he's only got to run  down the steps.  If I wasn't so dependent on them I'd have squashed the  student against the wall here a long time ago.  Right here, next to the  sign.  I'm always dreaming of doing that.  Just here, just above the  floor, that's where he's crushed onto the wall, his arms stretched out,  his fingers spread apart, his crooked legs twisted round into a circle  and blood squirted out all around him.  It's only ever been a dream so  far, though.\"  \"Is there nothing else you do?\" asked K. with a smile.  \"Nothing that I know of,\" said the usher.  \"And it's going to get even  worse now, up till now he's only been carrying her off for himself, now  he's started carrying her off for the judge and all, just like I'd  always said he would.\"  \"Does your wife, then, not share some of the  responsibility?\" asked K.  He had to force himself as he asked this  question, as he, too, felt so jealous now.  \"Course she does,\" said the  usher, \"it's more her fault than theirs.  It was her who attached  herself to him.  All he did, he just chases after any woman.  There's  five flats in this block alone where he's been thrown out after working  his way in there.  And my wife is the best looking woman in the whole  building, but it's me who's not even allowed to defend himself.\"  \"If  that's how things are, then there's nothing that can be done,\" said K.  \"Well why not?\" asked the usher.  \"He's a coward that student, if he  wants to lay a finger on my wife all you'd have to do is give him such a  good hiding he'd never dare do it again.  But I'm not allowed to do  that, and nobody else is going to do me the favour as they're all afraid  of his power.  The only one who could do it is a man like you.\"  \"What,  how could I do it?\" asked K. in astonishment.  \"Well you're facing a charge, aren't you,\" said the usher.  \"Yes, but  that's all the more reason for me to be afraid.  Even if he has no  influence on the outcome of the trial he probably has some on the  initial examination.\"  \"Yes, exactly,\" said the usher, as if K.'s view  had been just as correct as his own.  \"Only we don't usually get any  trials heard here with no hope at all.\"  \"I am not of the same opinion\",  said K., \"although that ought not to prevent me from dealing with the  student if the opportunity arises.\"  \"I would be very grateful to you,\"  said the usher of the court, somewhat formally, not really seeming to  believe that his highest wish could be fulfilled.  \"Perhaps,\" continued  K., \"perhaps there are some other officials of yours here, perhaps all  of them, who would deserve the same.\"  \"Oh yes, yes,\" said the usher, as  if this was a matter of course.  Then he looked at K. trustingly which,  despite all his friendliness, he had not done until then, and added,  \"they're always rebelling.\"  But the conversation seemed to have become  a little uncomfortable for him, as he broke it off by saying, \"now I  have to report to the office.  Would you like to come with me?\"  \"There's nothing for me to do there,\" said K.  \"You'd be able to have a look at it.  No-one will take any notice of  you.\"  \"Is it worth seeing then?\" asked K. hesitatingly, although he  felt very keen to go with him.  \"Well,\" said the usher, \"I thought you'd  be interested in it.\"  \"Alright then,\" said K. finally, \"I'll come with  you.\"  And, quicker than the usher himself, he ran up the steps.            At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there was  another step. \"They don't show much concern for the public,\" he said.  \"They don't show any concern at all,\" said the usher, \"just look at the  waiting room here.\"  It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly  made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic.  There was  no direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the  departments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up to  the ceiling to separate them from the corridor.  The light made its way  in through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials  through them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the  wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the  gaps.  There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it  was Sunday.  They were not very impressive.  They sat, equally spaced,  on two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both  sides of the corridor.  All of them were carelessly dressed although the  expressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and  many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to  the upper classes.  There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so  they had placed their hats under the bench, each probably having  followed the example of the others.  When those who were sitting nearest  the door saw K. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them,  and when the others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them,  so that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up.  None  of them stood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their knees  bent, they stood like beggars on the street.  K. waited for the usher,  who was following just behind him.  \"They must all be very dispirited,\"  he said.  \"Yes,\" said the usher, \"they are the accused, everyone you see  here has been accused.\"  \"Really!\" said K.  \"They're colleagues of mine  then.\"  And he turned to the nearest one, a tall, thin man with hair  that was nearly grey.  \"What is it you are waiting for here?\" asked K.,  politely, but the man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly,  which was all the more pitiful to see because the man clearly had some  experience of the world and elsewhere would certainly have been able to  show his superiority and would not have easily given up the advantage he  had acquired.  Here, though, he did not know what answer to give to such  a simple question and looked round at the others as if they were under  some obligation to help him, and as if no-one could expect any answer  from him without this help.  Then the usher of the court stepped forward  to him and, in order to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, \"The  gentleman here's only asking what it is you're waiting for.  You can  give him an answer.\"  The voice of the usher was probably familiar to  him, and had a better effect than K.'s.  \"I'm ... I'm waiting ...\" he  began, and then came to a halt.  He had clearly chosen this beginning so  that he could give a precise answer to the question, but now he didn't  know how to continue.  Some of the others waiting had come closer and  stood round the group, the usher of the court said to them, \"Get out the  way, keep the gangway free.\"  They moved back slightly, but not as far  as where they had been sitting before.  In the meantime, the man whom K.  had first approached had pulled himself together and even answered him  with a smile.  \"A month ago I made some applications for evidence to be heard in my  case, and I'm waiting for it to be settled.\"  \"You certainly seem to be  going to a lot of effort,\" said K.  \"Yes,\" said the man, \"it is my  affair after all.\"  \"Not everyone thinks the same way as you do,\" said  K. \"I've been indicted as well but I swear on my soul that I've neither  submitted evidence nor done anything else of the sort.  Do you really  think that's necessary?\"  \"I don't really know, exactly,\" said the man,  once more totally unsure of himself; he clearly thought K. was joking  with him and therefore probably thought it best to repeat his earlier  answer in order to avoid making any new mistakes.  With K. looking at  him impatiently, he just said, \"as far as I'm concerned, I've applied to  have this evidence heard.\"  \"Perhaps you don't believe I've been  indicted?\" asked K.  \"Oh, please, I certainly do,\" said the man,  stepping slightly to one side, but there was more anxiety in his answer  than belief.  \"You don't believe me then?\" asked K., and took hold of  his arm, unconsciously prompted by "]]]
