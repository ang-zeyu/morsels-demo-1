Had he not  set farmer Raught's pigs to walking on their hind legs and trying to  talk? When he shouted \"Hup! hup! hup!\" to farmer Williams's children, had  they not leaped to the moulding of the parlor wainscot,--a yard above the  floor and only an inch wide,--and walked around it, afterward skipping  like birds from chair-back to chair-back, while the furniture stood as if  nailed to the floor? And was he not the chief of thirteen night-riders,  whose faces no man had seen, nor wanted to see, and whom he sent about  the country on errands of mischief every night when the moon was growing  old? As to moons, had he not found a mystic message from our satellite on  Mount Riga, graven on a meteor?    Horses' tails were tied, hogs foamed at the mouth and walked like men,  cows gave blood for milk. These night-riders met Woolcott in a grove of  ash and chestnut trees, each furnished with a stolen bundle of oat straw,  and these bundles Woolcott changed to black horses when the night had  grown dark enough not to let the way of the change be seen. These horses  could not cross streams of water, and on the stroke of midnight they fell  to pieces and were oaten sheaves once more, but during their time of  action they rushed through woods, bearing their riders safely, and tore  like hurricanes across the fields, leaping bushes, fences, even trees,  without effort. Never could traces be found of them the next day. At last  the devil came to claim his own. Woolcott, who was ninety years old, lay  sick and helpless in his cabin. Clergymen refused to see him, but two or  three of his neighbors stifled their fears and went to the wizard's house  to soothe his dying moments. With the night came storm, and with its  outbreak the old man's face took on such a strange and horrible look that  the watchers fell back in alarm. There was a burst of purple flame at the  window, a frightful peal, a smell of sulphur, and Woolcott was dead. When  the watchers went out the roads were dry, and none in the village had  heard wind, rain, or thunder. It was the coming of the fiend.          POLLY'S LOVER    In about the middle of this century a withered woman of ninety was buried  from a now deserted house in White Plains, New York, Polly Carter the  name of her, but \"Crazy Polly\" was what the neighbors called her, for she  was eccentric and not fond of company. Among the belongings of her house  was a tall clock, such as relic hunters prize, that ticked solemnly in a  landing on the stairs.    For a time, during the Revolution, the house stood within the British  lines, and as her father was a colonel in Washington's army she was left  almost alone in it. The British officers respected her sex, but they had  an unpleasant way of running in unannounced and demanding entertainment,  in the king's name, which she felt forced to grant. One rainy afternoon  the door was flung open, then locked on the inside, and she found herself  in the arms of a stalwart, handsome lieutenant, who wore the blue. It was  her cousin and fiance. Their glad talk had not been going long when there  came a rousing summons at the door. Three English officers were awaiting  admittance.    Perhaps they had seen Lawrence Carter go into the house, and if caught he  would be killed as a spy. He must be hidden, but in some place where they  would not think of looking. The clock! That was the place. With a laugh  and a kiss the young man submitted to be shut in this narrow quarter, and  throwing his coat and hat behind some furniture the girl admitted the  officers, who were wet and surly and demanded dinner. They tramped about  the best room in their muddy boots, talking loudly, and in order to break  the effect of the chill weather they passed the brandy bottle freely.  Polly served them with a dinner as quickly as possible, for she wanted to  get them out of the house, but they were in no mood to go, and the bottle  passed so often that before the dinner was over they were noisy and tipsy  and were using language that drove Polly from the room.    At last, to her relief, she heard them preparing to leave the house, but  as they were about to go the senior officer, looking up at the landing,  now dim in the paling light, said to one of the others, \"See what time it  is.\" The officer addressed, who happened to be the drunkest of the party,  staggered up the stair and exclaimed, \"The d---d thing's stopped.\" Then,  as if he thought it a good joke, he added, \"It'll never go again.\"  Drawing his sabre he gave the clock a careless cut and ran the blade  through the panel of the door; after this the three passed out. When  their voices had died in distant brawling, Polly ran to release her  lover. Something thick and dark was creeping from beneath the clock-case.  With trembling fingers she pulled open the door, and Lawrence, her lover,  fell heavily forward into her arms, dead. The officer was right: the  clock never went again.          CROSBY, THE PATRIOT SPY    It was at the Jay house, in Westchester, New York, that Enoch Crosby met  Washington and offered his services to the patriot army. Crosby was a  cobbler, and not a very thriving one, but after the outbreak of  hostilities he took a peddler's outfit on his back and, as a  non-combatant, of Tory sympathies, he obtained admission through the  British lines. After his first visit to head quarters it is certain that  he always carried Sir Henry Clinton's passport in the middle of his pack,  and so sure were his neighbors that he was in the service of the British  that they captured him and took him to General Washington, but while his  case was up for debate he managed to slip his handcuffs, which were not  secure, and made off. Clinton, on the other hand, was puzzled by the  unaccountable foresight of the Americans, for every blow that he prepared  to strike was met, and he lost time and chance and temper. As if the  suspicion of both armies and the hatred of his neighbors were not enough  to contend against, Crosby now became an object of interest to the  Skinners and Cowboys, who were convinced that he was making money,  somehow, and resolved to have it.    The Skinners were camp-followers of the American troops and the Cowboys a  band of Tories and renegade British. Both factions were employed,  ostensibly, in foraging for their respective armies, but, in reality, for  themselves, and the farmers and citizens occupying the neutral belt north  of Manhattan Island had reason to curse them both impartially. While  these fellows were daring thieves, they occasionally got the worst of it,  even in the encounters with the farmers, as on the Neperan, near  Tarrytown, where the Cowboys chased a woman to death, but were afterward  cut to pieces by the enraged neighbors. Hers is but one of the many  ghosts that haunt the neutral ground, and the croaking of the birds of  ill luck that nest at Raven rock is blended with the cries of her dim  figure. Still, graceless as these fellows were, they affected a loyalty  to their respective sides, and were usually willing to fight each other  when they met, especially for the plunder that was to be got by fighting.    In October, 1780, Claudius Smith, \"king of the Cowboys,\" and three  scalawag sons came to the conclusion that it was time for Crosby's money  to revert to the crown, and they set off toward his little house one  evening, sure of finding him in, for his father was seriously ill. The  Smiths arrived there to find that the Skinners had preceded them on the  same errand, and they recognized through the windows, in the leader of  the band, a noted brigand on whose head a price was laid. He was  searching every crack and cranny of the room, while Crosby, stripped to  shirt and trousers, stood before the empty fireplace and begged for that  night to be left alone with his dying father.    \"To hell with the old man!\" roared the Skinner. \"Give up your gold, or  we'll put you to the torture,\" and he significantly whirled the end of a  rope that he carried about his waist. At that moment the faint voice of  the old man was heard calling from another room.    \"Take all that I have and let me go!\" cried Crosby, and turning up a  brick in the fire-place he disclosed a handful of gold, his life savings.  The leader still tried to oppose his exit, but Crosby flung him to the  floor and rushed away to his father, while the brigand, deeming it well  to delay rising, dug his fingers into the hollow and began to extract the  sovereigns. At that instant four muskets were discharged from without:  there was a crash of glass, a yell of pain, and four of the Skinners  rolled bleeding on the floor; two others ran into the darkness and  escaped; their leader, trying to follow, was met at the threshold by the  Smiths, who clutched the gold out of his hand and pinioned his elbows in  a twinkling.    \"I thought ye'd like to know who's got ye,\" said old Smith, peering into  the face of the astonished and crestfallen robber, \"for I've told ye many  a time to keep out of my way, and now ye've got to swing for getting into  it.\"    Within five minutes of the time that he had got his clutch on Crosby's  money the bandit was choking to death at the end of his own rope, hung  from the limb of an apple-tree, and, having secured the gold, the Cowboys  went their way into the darkness. Crosby soon made his appearance in the  ranks of the Continentals, and, though they looked askant at him for a  time, they soon discovered the truth and hailed him as a hero, for the  information he had carried to Washington from Clinton's camp had often  saved them from disaster. He had survived attack in his own house through  the falling out of rogues, and he survived the work and hazard of war  through luck and a sturdy frame. Congress afterwards gave him a sum of  money larger than had been taken from him, for his chief had commended  him in these lines: \"Circumstances of political importance, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],[0,"Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#13)"],[1,"him, nor is his manner of wielding his club the  same.\"    These things spake Human in his vileness, because that Afrasiyab had  enjoined him to lead Sohrab into destruction. And Sohrab held his peace,  but he was not wholly satisfied.    Now when the day had begun to lighten the sky and clear away the  shadows, Rustem and Sohrab strode forth unto the midway spot that  stretched between the armies. And Sohrab bare in his hands a mighty  club, and the garb of battle was upon him; but his mouth was full of  smiles, and he asked of Rustem how he had rested, and he said:    \"Wherefore hast thou prepared thy heart for battle? Cast from thee, I  beg, this mace and sword of vengeance, and let us doff our armour, and  seat ourselves together in amity, and let wine soften our angry deeds.  For it seemeth unto me that this conflict is impure. And if thou wilt  listen to my desires, my heart shall speak to thee of love, and I will  make the tears of shame spring up into thine eyes. And for this cause I  ask thee yet again, tell me thy name, neither hide it any longer, for I  behold that thou art of noble race. And it would seem unto me that thou  art Rustem, the chosen one, the Lord of Zaboulistan, the son of Zal, the  son of Saum the hero.\"    But Rustem answered, \"O hero of tender age, we are not come forth to  parley but to combat, and mine ears are sealed against thy words of  lure. I am an old man, and thou art young, but we are girded for battle,  and the Master of the world shall decide between us.\"    Then Sohrab said, \"O man of many years, wherefore wilt thou not listen  to the counsel of a stripling? I desired that thy soul should leave thee  upon thy bed, but thou hast elected to perish in the combat. That which  is ordained must be done, therefore let us make ready for the conflict.\"    So they made them ready, and when they had bound their steeds they fell  upon each other, and the crash of their encounter was heard like thunder  throughout the camps. And they measured their strength from the morning  until the setting of the sun. And when the day was about to vanish,  Sohrab seized upon Rustem by the girdle and threw him upon the ground,  and kneeled upon him, and drew forth his sword from the scabbard, and  would have severed his head from his trunk. Then Rustem knew that only  wile could save him. So he opened his mouth and said:    \"O young man, thou knowest not the customs of the combat. It is written  in the laws of honour that he who overthroweth a brave man for the first  time should not destroy him, but preserve him for fight a second time,  then only is it given unto him to kill his adversary.\"    And Sohrab listened to Rustem's words of craft and stayed his hand, and  he let the warrior go, and because that the day was ended he sought to  fight no more, but turned him aside and chased the deer until the night  was spent. Then came to him Human, and asked of the adventures of the  day. And Sohrab told him how he had vanquished the tall man, and how he  had granted him freedom. And Human reproached him with his folly, and  said:    \"Alas! young man, thou didst fall into a snare, for this is not the  custom among the brave. And now perchance thou wilt yet fall under the  hands of this warrior.\"    Sohrab was abashed when he heard the words of Human, but he said:    \"Be not grieved, for in an hour we meet again in battle, and verily he  will not stand a third time against my youthful strength.\"    Now while Sohrab was thus doing, Rustem was gone beside a running brook,  and laved his limbs, and prayed to God in his distress. And he entreated  of Ormuzd that He would grant him such strength that the victory must be  his. And Ormuzd heard him, and gave to him such strength that the rock  whereon Rustem stood gave way under his feet, because it had not power  to bear him. Then Rustem saw it was too much, and he prayed yet again  that part thereof be taken from him. And once more Ormuzd listened to  his voice. Then when the time for combat was come, Rustem turned him to  the meeting-place, and his heart was full of cares and his face of  fears. But Sohrab came forth like a giant refreshed, and he ran at  Rustem like to a mad elephant, and he cried with a voice of thunder:    \"O thou who didst flee from battle, wherefore art thou come out once  more against me? But I say unto thee, this time shall thy words of guile  avail thee naught.\"    And Rustem, when he heard him, and looked upon him, was seized with  misgiving, and he learned to know fear. So he prayed to Ormuzd that He  would restore to him the power He had taken back. But he suffered not  Sohrab to behold his fears, and they made them ready for the fight. And  he closed upon Sohrab with all his new-found might, and shook him  terribly, and though Sohrab returned his attacks with vigour, the hour  of his overthrow was come. For Rustem took him by the girdle and hurled  him unto the earth, and he broke his back like to a reed, and he drew  forth his sword to sever his body. Then Sohrab knew it was the end, and  he gave a great sigh, and writhed in his agony, and he said:    \"That which is come about, it is my fault, and henceforward will my  youth be a theme of derision among the people. But I sped not forth for  empty glory, but I went out to seek my father; for my mother had told me  by what tokens I should know him, and I perish for longing after him.  And now have my pains been fruitless, for it hath not been given unto me  to look upon his face. Yet I say unto thee, if thou shouldest become a  fish that swimmeth in the depths of the ocean, if thou shouldest change  into a star that is concealed in the farthest heaven, my father would  draw thee forth from thy hiding-place, and avenge my death upon thee  when he shall learn that the earth is become my bed. For my father is  Rustem the Pehliva, and it shall be told unto him how that Sohrab his  son perished in the quest after his face.\"    When Rustem heard these words his sword fell from out of his grasp, and  he was shaken with dismay. And there broke from his heart a groan as of  one whose heart was racked with anguish. And the earth became dark  before his eyes, and he sank down lifeless beside his son. But when he  had opened his eyes once more, he cried unto Sohrab in the agony of his  spirit. And he said:    \"Bearest thou about thee a token of Rustem, that I may know that the  words which thou speakest are true? For I am Rustem the unhappy, and may  my name be struck from the lists of men!\"    When Sohrab heard these words his misery was boundless, and he cried:    \"If thou art indeed my father, then hast thou stained thy sword in the  life-blood of thy son. And thou didst it of thine obstinacy. For I  sought to turn thee unto love, and I implored of thee thy name, for I  thought to behold in thee the tokens recounted of my mother. But I  appealed unto thy heart in vain, and now is the time gone by for  meeting. Yet open, I beseech thee, mine armour and regard the jewel upon  mine arm. For it is an onyx given unto me by my father, as a token  whereby he should know me.\"    Then Rustem did as Sohrab bade him, and he opened his mail and saw the  onyx; and when he had seen it he tore his clothes in his distress, and  he covered his head with ashes. And the tears of penitence ran from his  eyes, and he roared aloud in his sorrow. But Sohrab said:    \"It is in vain, there is no remedy. Weep not, therefore, for doubtless  it was written that this should be.\"    Now when the sun was set, and Rustem returned not to the camp, the  nobles of Iran were afraid, and they went forth to seek him. And when  they were gone but a little way they came upon Rakush, and when they saw  that he was alone they raised a wailing, for they deemed that of a  surety Rustem was perished. And they went and told Kai Kaous thereof,  and he said:    \"Let Tus go forth and see if this indeed be so, and if Rustem be truly  fallen, let the drums call men unto battle that we may avenge him upon  this Turk.\"    Now Sohrab, when he beheld afar off the men that were come out to seek  Rustem, turned to his father and said:    \"I entreat of thee that thou do unto me an act of love. Let not the Shah  fall upon the men of Turan, for they came not forth in enmity to him but  to do my desire, and on my head alone resteth this expedition. Wherefore  I desire not that they should perish when I can defend them no longer.  As for me, I came like the thunder and I vanish like the wind, but  perchance it is given unto us to meet again above.\"    Then Rustem promised to do the desires of Sohrab. And he went before the  men of Iran, and when they beheld him yet alive they set up a great  shout, but when they saw that his clothes were torn, and that he bare  about him the marks of sorrow, they asked of him what was come to pass.  Then he told them how he had caused a noble son to perish. And they were  grieved for him, and joined in his wailing. Then he bade one among them  to go forth into the camp of Turan, and deliver this message unto Human.  And he sent word unto him, saying:    \"The sword of vengeance must slumber in the scabbard. Thou art now  leader of the host; return, therefore, whence thou camest, and depart  across the river ere many days be fallen. As for me, I will fight no  more, yet neither will I speak unto thee again, for thou didst hide from  my son the tokens of his father, of thine iniquity thou didst lead him  into this pit.\"    Then when he had thus spoken, Rustem turned him yet again to his son.  And the nobles went with him, and they beheld Sohrab, and heard his  groans of pain. And Rustem, when he saw the agony of the boy, was beside  himself, and would have made an end of his own life, but the nobles  suffered it not, and stayed his hand. Then Rustem remembered him that  Kai Kaous had a balm mighty to heal. And he prayed Gudarz go before the  Shah, and bear unto him a message of entreaty from Rustem his"]]]
