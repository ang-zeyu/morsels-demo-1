The father laughed, and patted the child's head kindly.    'The end will come ere long,' he said. 'See where the mist lies at the  foot of the hill; there we will begin to climb among the olive-trees  and leave the dusty road. I know a quicker way by which we may reach  the city. We will climb over the great stones that mark the track of  the stream, and before the sun grows too hot we will have reached the  city gates.'    It was a great relief to the little hot, tired feet to feel the cool  grass beneath them, and to leave the dusty road. The boy almost forgot  his tiredness as he scrambled from stone to stone, and filled his hands  with the violets which grew thickly on the banks, scenting the morning  air with their sweetness. And when at last they came out once more upon  the great white road before the city gates, there was so much to gaze  upon and wonder at, that there was no room for thoughts of weariness or  hunger.    There stood the herds of great white oxen, patiently waiting to pass  in. Pietro wondered if their huge wide horns would not reach from side  to side of the narrow street within the gates. There the shepherd-boys  played sweet airs upon their pipes as they walked before their flocks,  and led the silly frightened sheep out of the way of passing carts.  Women with bright-coloured handkerchiefs tied over their heads crowded  round, carrying baskets of fruit and vegetables from the country round.  Carts full of scarlet and yellow pumpkins were driven noisily along.  Whips cracked, people shouted and talked as much with their hands as  with their lips, and all were eager to pass through the great Etruscan  gateway, which stood grim and tall against the blue of the summer sky.  Much good service had that gateway seen, and it was as strong as when  it had been first built hundreds of years before, and was still able to  shut out an army of enemies, if Perugia had need to defend herself.    Pietro and his father quickly threaded their way through the crowd, and  passed through the gateway into the steep narrow street beyond. It was  cool and quiet here. The sun was shut out by the tall houses, and the  shadows lay so deep that one might have thought it was the hour of  twilight, but for the peep of bright blue sky which showed between the  overhanging eaves above. Presently they reached the great square  market-place, where all again was sunshine and bustle, with people  shouting and selling their wares, which they spread out on the ground  up to the very steps of the cathedral and all along in front of the  Palazzo Publico. Here the man stopped, and asked one of the passers-by  if he could direct him to the shop of Niccolo the painter.    'Yonder he dwells,' answered the citizen, and pointed to a humble shop  at the corner of the market-place. 'Hast thou brought the child to be a  model?'    Pietro held his head up proudly, and answered quickly for himself.    'I am no longer a child,' he said; 'and I have come to work and not to  sit idle.'    The man laughed and went his way, while father and son hurried on  towards the little shop and entered the door.    The old painter was busy, and they had to wait a while until he could  leave his work and come to see what they might want.    'This is the boy of whom I spoke,' said the father as he pushed Pietro  forward by his shoulder. 'He is not well grown, but he is strong, and  has learnt to endure hardness. I promise thee that he will serve thee  well if thou wilt take him as thy servant.'    The painter smiled down at the little eager face which was waiting so  anxiously for his answer.    'What canst thou do?' he asked the boy.    'Everything,' answered Pietro promptly. 'I can sweep out thy shop and  cook thy dinner. I will learn to grind thy colours and wash thy  brushes, and do a man's work.'    'In faith,' laughed the painter, 'if thou canst do everything, being  yet so young, thou wilt soon be the greatest man in Perugia, and bring  great fame to this fair city. Then will we call thee no longer Pietro  Vanucci, but thou shalt take the city's name, and we will call thee  Perugino.'    The master spoke in jest, but as time went on and he watched the boy at  work, he marvelled at the quickness with which the child learned to  perform his new duties, and began to think the jest might one day turn  to earnest.    From early morning until sundown Pietro was never idle, and when the  rough work was done he would stand and watch the master as he painted,  and listen breathless to the tales which Niccolo loved to tell.    'There is nothing so great in all the world as the art of painting,'  the master would say. 'It is the ladder that leads up to heaven, the  window which lets light into the soul. A painter need never be lonely  or poor. He can create the faces he loves, while all the riches of  light and colour and beauty are always his. If thou hast it in thee to  be a painter, my little Perugino, I can wish thee no greater fortune.'    Then when the day's work was done and the short spell of twilight drew  near, the boy would leave the shop and run swiftly down the narrow  street until he came to the grim old city gates. Once outside, under  the wide blue sky in the free open air of the country, he drew a long,  long breath of pleasure, and quickly found a hidden corner in the cleft  of the hoary trunk of an olive-tree, where no passer-by could see him.  There he sat, his chin resting on his hands, gazing and gazing out over  the plain below, drinking in the beauty with his hungry eyes.    How he loved that great open space of sweet fresh air, in the calm pure  light of the evening hour. That white light, which seemed to belong  more to heaven than to earth, shone on everything around. Away in the  distance the purple hills faded into the sunset sky. At his feet the  plain stretched away, away until it met the mountains, here and there  lifting itself in some little hill crowned by a lonely town whose roofs  just caught the rays of the setting sun. The evening mist lay like a  gossamer veil upon the low-lying lands, and between the little towns  the long straight road could be seen, winding like a white ribbon  through the grey and silver, and marked here and there by a dark  cypress-tree or a tall poplar. And always there would be a glint of  blue, where a stream or river caught the reflection of the sky and held  it lovingly there, like a mirror among the rocks.    But Pietro did not have much time for idle dreaming. His was not an  easy life, for Niccolo made but little money with his painting, and the  boy had to do all the work of the house besides attending to the shop.  But all the time he was sweeping and dusting he looked forward to the  happy days to come when he might paint pictures and become a famous  artist.    Whenever a visitor came to the shop, Pietro would listen eagerly to his  talk and try to learn something of the great world of Art. Sometimes he  would even venture to ask questions, if the stranger happened to be one  who had travelled from afar.    'Where are the most beautiful pictures to be found?' he asked one day  when a Florentine painter had come to the little shop and had been  describing the glories he had seen in other cities. 'And where is it  that the greatest painters dwell?'    'That is an easy question to answer, my boy,' said the painter. 'All  that is fairest is to be found in Florence, the most beautiful city in  all the world, the City of Flowers. There one may find the best of  everything, but above all, the most beautiful pictures and the greatest  of painters. For no one there can bear to do only the second best, and  a man must attain to the very highest before the Florentines will call  him great. The walls of the churches and monasteries are covered with  pictures of saints and angels, and their beauty no words can describe.'    'I too will go to Florence, said Pietro to himself, and every day he  longed more and more to see that wonderful city.    It was no use to wait until he should have saved enough money to take  him there. He scarcely earned enough to live on from day to day. So at  last, poor as he was, he started off early one morning and said  good-bye to his old master and the hard work of the little shop in  Perugia. On he went down the same long white road which had seemed so  endless to him that day when, as a little child, he first came to  Perugia. Even now, when he was a strong young man, the way seemed long  and weary across that great plain, and he was often foot-sore and  discouraged. Day after day he travelled on, past the great lake which  lay like a sapphire in the bosom of the plain, past many towns and  little villages, until at last he came in sight of the City of Flowers.    It was a wonderful moment to Perugino, and he held his breath as he  looked. He had passed the brow of the hill, and stood beside a little  stream bordered by a row of tall, straight poplars which showed silvery  white against the blue sky. Beyond, nestling at the foot of the  encircling hills, lay the city of his dreams. Towers and palaces, a  crowding together of pale red sunbaked roofs, with the great dome of  the cathedral in the midst, and the silver thread of the Arno winding  its way between--all this he saw, but he saw more than this. For it  seemed to him that the Spirit of Beauty hovered above the fair city,  and he almost heard the rustle of her wings and caught a glimpse of her  rainbow-tinted robe in the light of the evening sky.    Poor Pietro! Here was the world he longed to conquer, but he was only a  poor country boy, and how was he to begin to climb that golden ladder  of Art which led men to fame and glory?    Well, he could work, and that was always a beginning.

Sallerl,  and to my best of all friends, Herr Bullinger; I do beg that next Sunday  at the usual eleven-o'clock music he will be so good as to make an  authoritative oration in my name, and present my regards to all the  members of the orchestra and exhort them to industry, that I may not one  day be accused of being a humbug, for I have everywhere extolled their  orchestra, and I intend always to do so.        65.    Augsburg, Oct. 14, 1777.    I HAVE made no mistake in my date, for I write before dinner, and I  think that next Friday, the day after to-morrow, we shall be off again.  Pray hear how generous the gentlemen of Augsburg are. In no place was  I ever so overwhelmed with marks of distinction as here. My first visit  was to the Stadtpfleger Longo Tabarro [Burgomaster Langenmantl].  My cousin, [Footnote: Leopold Mozart had a brother in Augsburg, a  bookbinder, whose daughter, \"das Basle\" (the cousin), was two years  younger than Mozart.] a good, kind, honest man and worthy citizen, went  with me, and had the honor to wait in the hall like a footman till my  interview with the high and mighty Stadtpfleger was over. I did not  fail first of all to present papa's respectful compliments. He deigned  graciously to remember you, and said, \"And pray how have things gone  with him?\" \"Vastly well, God be praised!\" I instantly rejoined, \"and I  hope things have also gone well with you?\" He then became more civil,  and addressed me in the third person, so I called him \"Sir\"; though,  indeed, I had done so from the first. He gave me no peace till I went  up with him to see his son-in-law (on the second floor), my cousin  meanwhile having the pleasure of waiting in the staircase-hall. I was  obliged to control myself with all my might, or I must have given some  polite hint about this. On going upstairs I had the satisfaction of  playing for nearly three-quarters of an hour on a good clavichord  of Stein's, in the presence of the stuck-up young son, and his prim  condescending wife, and the simple old lady. I first extemporized, and  then played all the music he had, prima, vista, and among others some  very pretty pieces of Edlmann's. Nothing could be more polite than they  all were, and I was equally so, for my rule is to behave to people just  as they behave to me; I find this to be the best plan. I said that I  meant to go to Stein's after dinner, so the young man offered to take me  there himself. I thanked him for his kindness, and promised to return  at two o'clock. I did so, and we went together in company with his  brother-in-law, who looks a genuine student. Although I had begged that  my name should not be mentioned, Herr von Langenmantl was so incautious  as to say, with a simper, to Herr Stein, \"I have the honor to present to  you a virtuoso on the piano.\" I instantly protested against this, saying  that I was only an indifferent pupil of Herr Sigl in Munich, who had  charged me with a thousand compliments to him. Stein shook his head  dubiously, and at length said, \"Surely I have the honor of seeing M.  Mozart?\" \"Oh, no,\" said I; \"my name is Trazom, and I have a letter for  you.\" He took the letter and was about to break the seal instantly, but  I gave him no time for that, saying, \"What is the use of reading the  letter just now? Pray open the door of your saloon at once, for I am  so very anxious to see your pianofortes.\" \"With all my heart,\" said he,  \"just as you please; but for all that I believe I am not mistaken.\" He  opened the door, and I ran straight up to one of the three pianos that  stood in the room. I began to play, and he scarcely gave himself time  to glance at the letter, so anxious was he to ascertain the truth; so  he only read the signature. \"Oh!\" cried he, embracing me, and crossing  himself and making all sorts of grimaces from intense delight. I  will write to you another day about his pianos. He then took me to a  coffee-house, but when we went in I really thought I must bolt, there  was such a stench of tobacco-smoke, but for all that I was obliged to  bear it for a good hour. I submitted to it all with a good grace, though  I could have fancied that I was in Turkey. He made a great fuss to me  about a certain Graf, a composer (of flute concertos only); and  said, \"He is something quite extraordinary,\" and every other possible  exaggeration. I became first hot and then cold from nervousness. This  Graf is a brother of the two who are in Harz and Zurich. He would  not give up his intention, but took me straight to him--a dignified  gentleman indeed; he wore a dressing-gown that I would not be ashamed to  wear in the street. All his words are on stilts, and he has a habit of  opening his mouth before knowing what he is going to say; so he often  shuts it again without having said anything. After a great deal of  ceremony he produced a concerto for two flutes; I was to play first  violin. The concerto is confused, not natural, too abrupt in its  modulations, and devoid of all genius. When it was over I praised it  highly, for, indeed, he deserves this. The poor man must have had labor  and study enough to write it. At last they brought a clavichord of  Stein's out of the next room, a very good one, but inch-thick with dust.  Herr Graf, who is director here, stood there looking like a man who had  hitherto believed his own modulations to be something very clever, but  all at once discovers that others may be still more so, and without  grating on the ear. In a word, they all seemed lost in astonishment.        66.    Augsburg, Oct. 17, 1777.    WITH regard to the daughter of Hamm, the Secretary of War, I can only  say that there can be no doubt she has a decided talent for music, for  she has only learned three years, and can play a number of pieces very  well. I find it difficult, however, to explain distinctly the impression  she makes on me while she is playing; she seems to me so curiously  constrained, and she has such an odd way of stalking over the keys with  her long bony fingers! To be sure, she has had no really good master,  and if she remains in Munich she will never become what her father  wishes and hopes, for he is eager beyond measure that she should one day  be a distinguished pianiste. If she goes to papa at Salzburg, it will  be a twofold benefit to her, both as to music and common sense, of which  she certainly has no great share. She has often made me laugh very much,  and you would have amusement enough for your trouble. She is too absent  to think of eating much. You say I ought to have practised with her? I  really could not for laughing, for when I occasionally played something  with the right hand, she instantly said bravissimo, and that in the  voice of a little mouse.    I will now relate to you as briefly as possible the Augsburg history  to which I have already alluded. Herr von Fingerle, who sent his  compliments to you, was also at Herr Graf's. The people were very civil,  and discussed the concert I proposed to give, all saying, \"It will be  one of the most brilliant concerts ever given in Augsburg. You have  a great advantage in having made the acquaintance of our Stadtpfleger  Langenmantl; besides, the name of Mozart has much influence here.\" So  we separated mutually pleased. I must now tell you that Herr von  Langenmantl, junior, when at Herr Stein's, said that he would pledge  himself to arrange a concert in the Stube, [Footnote: The Bauernstube,  the Patrician Casino.] (as something very select, and complimentary to  me,) for the nobility alone. You can't think with what zeal he spoke,  and promised to undertake it. We agreed that I should call on him the  next morning for the answer; accordingly I went; this was on the 13th.  He was very polite, but said that as yet he could not say anything  decided. I played there again for an hour, and he invited me next day,  the 14th, to dinner. In the forenoon he sent to beg that I would come  to him at eleven o'clock, and bring some pieces with me, as he had  asked some of the professional musicians, and they intended to have some  music. I immediately sent some music, and went myself at eleven, when,  with many lame excuses, he coolly said, \"By the by, I could do nothing  about the concert; oh, I was in such a rage yesterday on your account.  The patrician members of the Casino said that their cashbox was at  a very low ebb, and that you were not the kind of virtuoso who could  expect a souverain d'or.\" I merely smiled, and said, \"I quite agree with  them.\" N. B.--He is Intendant of Music in the Casino, and the old father  a magistrate! but I cared very little about it. We sat down to dinner;  the old gentleman also dined up-stairs with us, and was very civil,  but did not say a word about the concert. After dinner I played two  concertos, something out of my head, and then a trio of Hafeneder's  on the violin. I would gladly have played more, but I was so badly  accompanied that it gave me the colic. He said to me, good-naturedly,  \"Don't let us part company to-day; go to the play with us, and return  here to supper.\" We were all very merry. When we came back from the  theatre, I played again till we went to supper. Young Langenmantl had  already questioned me in the forenoon about my cross, [Footnote: Mozart,  by his father's desire, wore the \"Order of the Golden Spur,\" conferred  on him by the Pope.] and I told him exactly how I got it, and what it  was. He and his brother-in-law said over and over again, \"Let us order a  cross, too, that we may be on a par with Herr Mozart.\" I took no notice  of this. They also repeatedly said, \"Hallo! you sir! Knight of the  Spur!\" I said not a word; but during supper it became really too bad.  \"What may it have cost? three ducats? must you have permission to wear  it? Do you pay extra for leave to do so? We really must get one just  like it.\" An officer there of the name of Bach, said, \"For shame! what  "]]]
