When I entered the kitchen I  found no one there, but while I consumed the inevitable ham and egg,  Amos arrived back for breakfast. He brought with him the morning's  paper.    'The _Herald_ says there's been a big battle at Eepers,' he announced.    I tore open the sheet and read of the great attack of 31 July which was  spoiled by the weather. 'My God!' I cried. 'They've got St Julien and  that dirty Frezenberg ridge ... and Hooge ... and Sanctuary Wood. I  know every inch of the damned place....'    'Mr Brand,' said a warning voice, 'that'll never do. If our friends  last night heard ye talk like that ye might as well tak the train back  to London ... They're speakin' about ye in the yards this morning.  Ye'll get a good turnout at your meeting the night, but they're Sayin'  that the polis will interfere. That mightna be a bad thing, but I trust  ye to show discretion, for ye'll not be muckle use to onybody if they  jyle ye in Duke Street. I hear Gresson will be there with a fraternal  message from his lunatics in America ... I've arranged that ye go down  to Tam Norie this afternoon and give him a hand with his bit paper. Tam  will tell ye the whole clash o' the West country, and I look to ye to  keep him off the drink. He's aye arguin' that writin' and drinkin' gang  thegither, and quotin' Robert Burns, but the creature has a wife and  five bairns dependin' on him.'    I spent a fantastic day. For two hours I sat in Norie's dirty den,  while he smoked and orated, and, when he remembered his business, took  down in shorthand my impressions of the Labour situation in South  Africa for his rag. They were fine breezy impressions, based on the  most whole-hearted ignorance, and if they ever reached the Rand I  wonder what my friends there made of Cornelius Brand, their author. I  stood him dinner in an indifferent eating-house in a street off the  Broomielaw, and thereafter had a drink with him in a public-house, and  was introduced to some of his less reputable friends.    About tea-time I went back to Amos's lodgings, and spent an hour or so  writing a long letter to Mr Ivery. I described to him everybody I had  met, I gave highly coloured views of the explosive material on the  Clyde, and I deplored the lack of clearheadedness in the progressive  forces. I drew an elaborate picture of Amos, and deduced from it that  the Radicals were likely to be a bar to true progress. 'They have  switched their old militancy,' I wrote, 'on to another track, for with  them it is a matter of conscience to be always militant.' I finished up  with some very crude remarks on economics culled from the table-talk of  the egregious Tombs. It was the kind of letter which I hoped would  establish my character in his mind as an industrious innocent.    Seven o'clock found me in Newmilns Street, where I was seized upon by  Wilkie. He had put on a clean collar for the occasion and had partially  washed his thin face. The poor fellow had a cough that shook him like  the walls of a power-house when the dynamos are going.    He was very apologetic about Amos. 'Andra belongs to a past worrld,' he  said. 'He has a big reputation in his society, and he's a fine fighter,  but he has no kind of Vision, if ye understand me. He's an auld  Gladstonian, and that's done and damned in Scotland. He's not a Modern,  Mr Brand, like you and me. But tonight ye'll meet one or two chaps  that'll be worth your while to ken. Ye'll maybe no go quite as far as  them, but ye're on the same road. I'm hoping for the day when we'll  have oor Councils of Workmen and Soldiers like the Russians all over  the land and dictate our terms to the pawrasites in Pawrliament. They  tell me, too, the boys in the trenches are comin' round to our side.'    We entered the hall by a back door, and in a little waiting-room I was  introduced to some of the speakers. They were a scratch lot as seen in  that dingy place. The chairman was a shop-steward in one of the  Societies, a fierce little rat of a man, who spoke with a cockney  accent and addressed me as 'Comrade'. But one of them roused my  liveliest interest. I heard the name of Gresson, and turned to find a  fellow of about thirty-five, rather sprucely dressed, with a flower in  his buttonhole. 'Mr Brand,' he said, in a rich American voice which  recalled Blenkiron's. 'Very pleased to meet you, sir. We have come from  remote parts of the globe to be present at this gathering.' I noticed  that he had reddish hair, and small bright eyes, and a nose with a  droop like a Polish Jew's.    As soon as we reached the platform I saw that there was going to be  trouble. The hall was packed to the door, and in all the front half  there was the kind of audience I expected to see--working-men of the  political type who before the war would have thronged to party  meetings. But not all the crowd at the back had come to listen. Some  were scallawags, some looked like better-class clerks out for a spree,  and there was a fair quantity of khaki. There were also one or two  gentlemen not strictly sober.    The chairman began by putting his foot in it. He said we were there  tonight to protest against the continuation of the war and to form a  branch of the new British Council of Workmen and Soldiers. He told them  with a fine mixture of metaphors that we had got to take the reins into  our own hands, for the men who were running the war had their own axes  to grind and were marching to oligarchy through the blood of the  workers. He added that we had no quarrel with Germany half as bad as we  had with our own capitalists. He looked forward to the day when British  soldiers would leap from their trenches and extend the hand of  friendship to their German comrades.    'No me!' said a solemn voice. 'I'm not seekin' a bullet in my  wame,'--at which there was laughter and cat-calls.    Tombs followed and made a worse hash of it. He was determined to speak,  as he would have put it, to democracy in its own language, so he said  'hell' several times, loudly but without conviction. Presently he  slipped into the manner of the lecturer, and the audience grew  restless. 'I propose to ask myself a question--' he began, and from the  back of the hall came--'And a damned sully answer ye'll get.' After  that there was no more Tombs.    I followed with extreme nervousness, and to my surprise got a fair  hearing. I felt as mean as a mangy dog on a cold morning, for I hated  to talk rot before soldiers--especially before a couple of Royal Scots  Fusiliers, who, for all I knew, might have been in my own brigade. My  line was the plain, practical, patriotic man, just come from the  colonies, who looked at things with fresh eyes, and called for a new  deal. I was very moderate, but to justify my appearance there I had to  put in a wild patch or two, and I got these by impassioned attacks on  the Ministry of Munitions. I mixed up a little mild praise of the  Germans, whom I said I had known all over the world for decent fellows.  I received little applause, but no marked dissent, and sat down with  deep thankfulness.    The next speaker put the lid on it. I believe he was a noted agitator,  who had already been deported. Towards him there was no lukewarmness,  for one half of the audience cheered wildly when he rose, and the other  half hissed and groaned. He began with whirlwind abuse of the idle  rich, then of the middle-classes (he called them the 'rich man's  flunkeys'), and finally of the Government. All that was fairly well  received, for it is the fashion of the Briton to run down every  Government and yet to be very averse to parting from it. Then he  started on the soldiers and slanged the officers ('gentry pups' was his  name for them), and the generals, whom he accused of idleness, of  cowardice, and of habitual intoxication. He told us that our own kith  and kin were sacrificed in every battle by leaders who had not the guts  to share their risks. The Scots Fusiliers looked perturbed, as if they  were in doubt of his meaning. Then he put it more plainly. 'Will any  soldier deny that the men are the barrage to keep the officers' skins  whole?'    'That's a bloody lee,' said one of the Fusilier jocks.    The man took no notice of the interruption, being carried away by the  torrent of his own rhetoric, but he had not allowed for the persistence  of the interrupter. The jock got slowly to his feet, and announced that  he wanted satisfaction. 'If ye open your dirty gab to blagyird honest  men, I'll come up on the platform and wring your neck.'    At that there was a fine old row, some crying out 'Order', some 'Fair  play', and some applauding. A Canadian at the back of the hall started  a song, and there was an ugly press forward. The hall seemed to be  moving up from the back, and already men were standing in all the  passages and right to the edge of the platform. I did not like the look  in the eyes of these new-comers, and among the crowd I saw several who  were obviously plain-clothes policemen.    The chairman whispered a word to the speaker, who continued when the  noise had temporarily died down. He kept off the army and returned to  the Government, and for a little sluiced out pure anarchism. But he got  his foot in it again, for he pointed to the Sinn Feiners as examples of  manly independence. At that, pandemonium broke loose, and he never had  another look in. There were several fights going on in the hall between  the public and courageous supporters of the orator.    Then Gresson advanced to the edge of the platform in a vain endeavour  to retrieve the day. I must say he did it uncommonly well. He was  clearly a practised speaker, and for a moment his appeal 'Now, boys,  let's cool down a bit and talk sense,' had an effect. But the mischief  had been done, and the crowd was surging round the lonely redoubt where  we sat. Besides, I could see that for all his clever talk the meeting  did not like the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5605"],[0,"The Power of Movement in Plants (#13)"],[1," about 22 times, here reduced to one-half of  original scale.    circle in the course of about 8 h. during the night it travelled to a  considerable distance in the direction indicated by the broken line. A  glass filament was attached longitudinally to the other cotyledon, and this  nearly completed (Fig, 44, B) an irregular circular figure in about 12  hours. During the night it also moved to a considerable distance, in the  direction indicated by the broken line. The cotyledons therefore  circumnutate independently of the movement of the hypocotyl. Although they  moved much during the night, they did not approach each other so as to  stand more vertically than during the day.  [page 58]    Cycas pectinata (Cycadeae).--The large seeds of this plant in germinating  first protrude a single leaf, which breaks through the ground with the  petiole bowed into an arch and with the leaflets involuted. A leaf in this  condition, which at the close of our observations was 2 ½ inches in height,  had its movements traced in a warm greenhouse by means of a glass filament  bearing paper triangles attached across its tip. The tracing (Fig. 45)  shows how large, complex, and rapid were the circum-    Fig. 45.

The extreme distance from side to side which it passed  over amounted to between .6 and .7 of an inch.    Canna Warscewiczii (Cannaceae).--A seedling with the plumule projecting one  inch above the ground was observed, but not under fair conditions, as it  was brought out of the hot-house and kept in a room not sufficiently warm.  Nevertheless the tracing (Fig. 46) shows that it made two or three  incomplete irregular circles or ellipses in the course of 48 hours. The  plumule is straight; and this was the first instance observed  [page 59]  by us of the part that first breaks through the ground not being arched.    Fig. 46. Canna Warscewiczii: circumnutation of plumule with filament  affixed obliquely to outer sheath-like leaf, traced in darkness on  horizontal glass from 8.45 A.M. Nov. 9th to 8.10 A.M. 11th. Movement of  bead magnified 6 times.    Allium cepa (Liliaceae).--The narrow green leaf, which protrudes from the  seed of the common onion as a cotyledon,* breaks through the ground in the  form of an arch, in the same manner as the hypocotyl or epicotyl of a  dicotyledonous plant. Long after the arch has risen above the surface the  apex remains within the seed-coats, evidently absorbing the still abundant  contents. The summit or crown of the arch, when it first protrudes from the  seed and is still buried beneath the ground, is simply rounded; but before  it reaches the surface it is developed into a conical protuberance of a  white colour (owing to the absence of chlorophyll), whilst the adjoining  parts are green, with the epidermis apparently rather thicker and tougher  than elsewhere. We may therefore conclude that this conical protuberance is  a special adaptation for breaking through the ground,** and answers the  same end as the knife-like white crest on the summit of the straight  cotyledon of the Gramineae.    * This is the expression used by Sachs in his 'Text-book of Botany.'    ** Haberlandt has briefly described ('Die  Schutzeinrichtungen...Keimpflanze,' 1877, p. 77) this curious structure and  the purpose which it subserves. He states that good figures of the  cotyledon of the onion have been given by Tittmann and by Sachs in his  'Experimental Physiologie,' p. 93.  [page 60]    After a time the apex is drawn out of the empty seed-coats, and rises up,  forming a right angle, or more commonly a still larger angle with the lower  part, and occasionally the whole becomes nearly straight. The conical  protuberance, which originally formed the crown of the arch, is now seated  on one side, and appears like a joint or knee, which from acquiring  chlorophyll becomes green, and increases in size. In rarely or never  becoming perfectly straight, these cotyledons differ remarkably from the  ultimate condition of the arched hypocotyls or epicotyls of dicotyledons.  It is, also, a singular circumstance that the attenuated extremity of the  upper bent portion invariably withers and dies.    A filament, 1.7 inch in length, was affixed nearly upright beneath the knee  to the basal and vertical portion of a cotyledon; and its movements were  traced during 14 h. in the usual manner. The tracing here given (Fig. 47)  indicates circumnutation. The movement of the upper part above the knee of  the same cotyledon, which projected at about an angle of 45o above the  horizon, was observed at the same time. A filament was not affixed to it,  but a mark was placed beneath the apex, which was almost white from  beginning to wither, and its movements were thus traced. The figure  described resembled pretty closely that above given; and this shows that  the chief seat of movement is in the lower or basal part of the cotyledon.    Fig. 47. Allium cepa: circumnutation of basal half of arched cotyledon,  traced in darkness on horizontal glass, from 8.15 A.M. to 10 P.M. Oct.  31st. Movement of bead magnified about 17 times.    Asparagus officinalis (Asparageae).--The tip of a straight plumule or  cotyledon (for we do not know which it should be called) was found at a  depth of .1 inch beneath the surface, and the earth was then removed all  round to the dept of .3 inch. a glass filament was affixed obliquely to it,  and the movement of the bead, magnified 17 times, was traced in darkness.  During the first 1 h. 15 m. the plumule moved to the right, and during the  next two hours it returned in a roughly parallel but strongly zigzag  course. From some unknown cause it had grown up through the soil in an  inclined direction, and now through apogeotropism it moved during nearly 24  h. in  [page 61]  the same general direction, but in a slightly zigzag manner, until it  became upright. On the following morning it changed its course completely.  There can therefore hardly be a doubt that the plumule circumnutates,  whilst buried beneath the ground, as much as the pressure of the  surrounding earth will permit. The surface of the soil in the pot was now  covered with a thin layer of very fine argillaceous sand, which was kept  damp; and after the tapering seedlings had grown a few tenths of an inch in  height, each was found surrounded by a little open space or circular crack;  and this could be accounted for only by their having circumnutated and thus  pushed away the sand on all sides; for there was no vestige of a crack in  any other part.    In order to prove that there was circumnutation, the move-    Fig. 48. Asparagus officinalis: circumnutation of plumules with tips  whitened and marks placed beneath, traced on a horizontal glass. A, young  plumule; movement traced from 8.30 A.M. Nov. 30th to 7.15 A.M. next  morning; magnified about 35 times. B, older plumule; movement traced from  10.15 A.M. to 8.10 P.M. Nov. 29th; magnified 9 times, but here reduced to  one-half of original scale.    ments of five seedlings, varying in height from .3 inch to 2 inches, were  traced. They were placed within a box and illuminated from above; but in  all five cases the longer axes of the figures described were directed to  nearly the same point; so that more light seemed to have come through the  glass roof of the greenhouse on one side than on any other. All five  tracings resembled each other to a certain extent, and it will suffice to  give two of them. In A (Fig. 48) the seedling was only .45 of an  [page 62]  inch in height, and consisted of a single internode bearing a bud on its  summit. The apex described between 8.30 A.M. and 10.20 P.M. (i.e. during  nearly 14 hours) a figure which would probably have consisted of 3 ½  ellipses, had not the stem been drawn to one side until 1 P.M., after which  hour it moved backwards. On the following morning it was not far distant  from the point whence it had first started. The actual amount of movement  of the apex from side to side was very small, viz. about 1/18th of an inch.  The seedling of which the movements are shown in Fig. 48, B, was 1 3/4 inch  in height, and consisted of three internodes besides the bud on the summit.  The figure, which was described during 10 h., apparently represents two  irregular and unequal ellipses or circles. The actual amount of movement of  the apex, in the line not influenced by the light, was .11 of an inch, and  in that thus influenced .37 of an inch. With a seedling 2 inches in height  it was obvious, even without the aid of any tracing, that the uppermost  part of the stem bent successively to all points of the compass, like the  stem of a twining plant. A little increase in the power of circumnutating  and in the flexibility of the stem, would convert the common asparagus into  a twining plant, as has occurred with one species in this genus, namely, A.  scandens.    Phalaris Canariensis (Gramineae).--With the Gramineae the part which first  rises above the ground has been called by some authors the pileole; and  various views have been expressed on its homological nature. It is  considered by some great authorities to be a cotyledon, which term we will  use without venturing to express any opinion on the subject.* It consists  in the present case of a slightly flattened reddish sheath, terminating  upwards in a sharp white edge; it encloses a true green leaf, which  protrudes from the sheath through a slit-like orifice, close beneath and at  right angles to the sharp edge on the summit. The sheath is not arched when  it breaks through the ground.    The movements of three rather old seedlings, about 1 ½ inch in height,  shortly before the protrusion of the leaves, were first traced."]]]
