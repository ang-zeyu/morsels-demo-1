Please excuse us and tell me.\"    The minister looked at the picture. A stern expression came into his  gentle blue eyes and he got as near to frowning as it was possible for  him to get.    \"Where did you get that thing?\" he asked.    THING! We began to breathe easier.    \"We bought it from Jerry Cowan. He found it in a red-covered history of  the world. It SAYS it's God's picture,\" said Felix.    \"It is nothing of the sort,\" said Mr. Marwood indignantly. \"There is  no such thing as a picture of God, Felix. No human being knows what he  looks like--no human being CAN know. We should not even try to think  what He looks like. But, Felix, you may be sure that God is infinitely  more beautiful and loving and tender and kind than anything we can  imagine of Him. Never believe anything else, my boy. As for this--this  SACRILEGE--take it and burn it.\"    We did not know what a sacrilege meant, but we knew that Mr. Marwood had  declared that the picture was not like God. That was enough for us. We  felt as if a terrible weight had been lifted from our minds.    \"I could hardly believe the Story Girl, but of course the minister  KNOWS,\" said Dan happily.    \"We've lost fifty cents because of it,\" said Felicity gloomily.    We had lost something of infinitely more value than fifty cents,  although we did not realize it just then. The minister's words had  removed from our minds the bitter belief that God was like that picture;  but on something deeper and more enduring than mind an impression had  been made that was never to be removed. The mischief was done. From  that day to this the thought or the mention of God brings up before us  involuntarily the vision of a stern, angry, old man. Such was the price  we were to pay for the indulgence of a curiosity which each of us, deep  in our hearts, had, like Sara Ray, felt ought not to be gratified.    \"Mr. Marwood told me to burn it,\" said Felix.    \"It doesn't seem reverent to do that,\" said Cecily. \"Even if it isn't  God's picture, it has His name on it.\"    \"Bury it,\" said the Story Girl.    We did bury it after tea, in the depths of the spruce grove; and then we  went into the orchard. It was so nice to have the Story Girl back again.  She had wreathed her hair with Canterbury Bells, and looked like the  incarnation of rhyme and story and dream.    \"Canterbury Bells is a lovely name for a flower, isn't it?\" she said.  \"It makes you think of cathedrals and chimes, doesn't it? Let's go over  to Uncle Stephen's Walk, and sit on the branches of the big tree. It's  too wet on the grass, and I know a story--a TRUE story, about an old  lady I saw in town at Aunt Louisa's. Such a dear old lady, with lovely  silvery curls.\"    After the rain the air seemed dripping with odours in the warm west  wind--the tang of fir balsam, the spice of mint, the wild woodsiness of  ferns, the aroma of grasses steeping in the sunshine,--and with it all a  breath of wild sweetness from far hill pastures.    Scattered through the grass in Uncle Stephen's Walk, were blossoming  pale, aerial flowers which had no name that we could ever discover.  Nobody seemed to know anything about them. They had been there when  Great-grandfather King bought the place. I have never seen them  elsewhere, or found them described in any floral catalogue. We called  them the White Ladies. The Story Girl gave them the name. She said they  looked like the souls of good women who had had to suffer much and had  been very patient. They were wonderfully dainty, with a strange, faint,  aromatic perfume which was only to be detected at a little distance and  vanished if you bent over them. They faded soon after they were plucked;  and, although strangers, greatly admiring them, often carried away roots  and seeds, they could never be coaxed to grow elsewhere.    \"My story is about Mrs. Dunbar and the Captain of the FANNY,\" said the  Story Girl, settling herself comfortably on a bough, with her brown head  against a gnarled trunk. \"It's sad and beautiful--and true. I do love to  tell stories that I know really happened. Mrs. Dunbar lives next door to  Aunt Louisa in town. She is so sweet. You wouldn't think to look at her  that she had a tragedy in her life, but she has. Aunt Louisa told me the  tale. It all happened long, long ago. Interesting things like this all  did happen long ago, it seems to me. They never seem to happen now. This  was in '49, when people were rushing to the gold fields in California.  It was just like a fever, Aunt Louisa says. People took it, right here  on the Island; and a number of young men determined they would go to  California.    \"It is easy to go to California now; but it was a very different matter  then. There were no railroads across the land, as there are now, and if  you wanted to go to California you had to go in a sailing vessel, all  the way around Cape Horn. It was a long and dangerous journey; and  sometimes it took over six months. When you got there you had no way of  sending word home again except by the same plan. It might be over a year  before your people at home heard a word about you--and fancy what their  feelings would be!    \"But these young men didn't think of these things; they were led on by a  golden vision. They made all their arrangements, and they chartered the  brig _Fanny_ to take them to California.    \"The captain of the _Fanny_ is the hero of my story. His name was Alan  Dunbar, and he was young and handsome. Heroes always are, you know,  but Aunt Louisa says he really was. And he was in love--wildly in  love,--with Margaret Grant. Margaret was as beautiful as a dream, with  soft blue eyes and clouds of golden hair; and she loved Alan Dunbar just  as much as he loved her. But her parents were bitterly opposed to him,  and they had forbidden Margaret to see him or speak to him. They hadn't  anything against him as a MAN, but they didn't want her to throw herself  away on a sailor.    \"Well, when Alan Dunbar knew that he must go to California in the  _Fanny_ he was in despair. He felt that he could NEVER go so far away  for so long and leave his Margaret behind. And Margaret felt that she  could never let him go. I know EXACTLY how she felt.\"    \"How can you know?\" interrupted Peter suddenly. \"You ain't old enough to  have a beau. How can you know?\"    The Story Girl looked at Peter with a frown. She did not like to be  interrupted when telling a story.    \"Those are not things one KNOWS about,\" she said with dignity. \"One  FEELS about them.\"    Peter, crushed but not convinced, subsided, and the Story Girl went on.    \"Finally, Margaret ran away with Alan, and they were married in  Charlottetown. Alan intended to take his wife with him to California in  the _Fanny_. If it was a hard journey for a man it was harder still for  a woman, but Margaret would have dared anything for Alan's sake. They  had three days--ONLY three days--of happiness, and then the blow fell.  The crew and the passengers of the _Fanny_ refused to let Captain Dunbar  take his wife with him. They told him he must leave her behind. And  all his prayers were of no avail. They say he stood on the deck of the  _Fanny_ and pleaded with the men while the tears ran down his face; but  they would not yield, and he had to leave Margaret behind. Oh, what a  parting it was!\"    There was heartbreak in the Story Girl's voice and tears came into our  eyes. There, in the green bower of Uncle Stephen's Walk, we cried over  the pathos of a parting whose anguish had been stilled for many years.    \"When it was all over, Margaret's father and mother forgave her, and she  went back home to wait--to WAIT. Oh, it is so dreadful just to WAIT,  and do nothing else. Margaret waited for nearly a year. How long it must  have seemed to her! And at last there came a letter--but not from Alan.  Alan was DEAD. He had died in California and had been buried there.  While Margaret had been thinking of him and longing for him and praying  for him he had been lying in his lonely, faraway grave.\"    Cecily sprang up, shaking with sobs.    \"Oh, don't--don't go on,\" she implored. \"I CAN'T bear any more.\"    \"There is no more,\" said the Story Girl. \"That was the end of it--the  end of everything for Margaret. It didn't kill HER, but her heart died.\"    \"I just wish I'd hold of those fellows who wouldn't let the Captain take  his wife,\" said Peter savagely.    \"Well, it was awful said,\" said Felicity, wiping her eyes. \"But it was  long ago and we can't do any good by crying over it now. Let us go  and get something to eat. I made some nice little rhubarb tarts this  morning.\"    We went. In spite of new disappointments and old heartbreaks we had  appetites. And Felicity did make scrumptious rhubarb tarts!        CHAPTER IX. MAGIC SEED    When the time came to hand in our collections for the library fund Peter  had the largest--three dollars. Felicity was a good second with two and  a half. This was simply because the hens had laid so well.    \"If you'd had to pay father for all the extra handfuls of wheat you've  fed to those hens, Miss Felicity, you wouldn't have so much,\" said Dan  spitefully.    \"I didn't,\" said Felicity indignantly. \"Look how Aunt Olivia's hens  laid, too, and she fed them herself just the same as usual.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Cecily, \"we have all got something to give. If you  were like poor Sara Ray, and hadn't been able to collect anything, you  might feel bad.\"    But Sara Ray HAD something to give. She came up the hill after tea, all  radiant. When Sara Ray smiled--and she did not waste her smiles--she was  rather pretty in a plaintive, apologetic way. A dimple or two came  into sight, and she had very nice teeth--small and white, like the  traditional row of pearls.    \"Oh, just look,\" she said. \"Here are three dollars--and I'm"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53506"],[0,"A Collection of Kachári Folk-Tales and Rhymes (#13)"],[1,"    And next they came across a flock of paddy-birds, which the Brahmin  called \"Bog,\" but the servant \"Boguli.\" And again he was worsted  and got his five blows. On which he consoled himself by reciting an  Assamese saying, to the effect that it is ill arguing with a fool:                 \"Sâg sirmolu bog ba-káran              Tinî pânch panra kîl sudâ akâran.\"      And when they were now come near the Brahmin's mother-in-law's house,  and the Brahmin was become very hungry, he sent his servant on ahead  to beg them to get supper ready. So the servant went on ahead and  bade the Brahmin's mother-in-law cook a duck and put lots of plantain  ashes, which the Kacháris use for salt, well knowing that his master  disliked its acrid taste. So the duck was cooked with plenty of alkali.    And when the Brahmin arrived, his meal was set before him, and he  was so hungry that he had to eat it whether he liked its savour or no.    And so in various ways the Brahmin was put to shame by his servant. So  he wrote a long letter to his brother, and, putting it in his servant's  hand, bade him deliver it. But he went a little way, until he met  a man who could read and write, and he bade him tell him what was  written in the letter. And the man read him the letter, which was to  the effect that the brother was to kill the servant. On this, the  servant tore up the letter and bade his friend write another one,  saying \"Dear brother, on receipt of this letter marry my servant to  my niece without delay. I shall not be able to come to the wedding.\"    Taking this letter, the servant went to his master's brother, who was  much vexed, but dared not disobey. Accordingly, though reluctantly,  he married the servant to his daughter.    And, when the master came to see if his servant had been disposed  of, and heard what had happened, he set about to kill him. But his  niece got to know of the matter and told her husband, who got a calf,  and, binding it hand and foot, put it by her in her bed. And in the  night the Brahmin came, and thinking the calf was his niece's husband  sleeping by her side, killed it. And when he found out his mistake in  the morning, and learned that he was guilty of cow-killing, he bade  his niece's husband go and bury the calf in all haste. And the servant  dragged the calf into the garden and buried it with its tail sticking  out of the ground. Meanwhile, the Brahmin set to work to get himself  purged of the offence of cow-killing, and summoned the villagers  to a feast without telling them why. And when they were all seated,  the servant ran out into the garden and hauling at the calf's tail,  called out \"The Brahmin didn't kill a cow, Oh, no! and            THE STORY OF THE SIMPLETON.    There was once an aged couple, who had a foolish son, who one day  begged them to give him money to buy an ox with. And, owing to his  persistence, though they knew him to be simple, they gave him sixteen  rupees and let him go. And, as he went, he found a fine ox grazing  where three roads meet; and, putting his rupees down on the road,  he bound the ox and drove it away. Presently, he stopped to rest,  and while he was dozing, his ox ran away. So he began searching all  through the jungle for the missing animal.    At last he found a fine stag, and thinking that to be his ox, chased it  through the forest till by chance its horns got caught in a thicket. So  he tied a rope round its horns, and to that tied another rope, and  so on till he got home. And when his old mother asked him if he had  bought his ox \"Havn't I, just,\" said he, \"just help me to pull and  see!\" On this, the three of them pulled at the rope, hand over hand,  and presently the stag made his appearance kicking and struggling,  at which they were mightily afraid. However, they killed the stag,  and gave of its flesh to the neighbours to eat.    On which the simpleton went about and told the villagers that they had  eaten of cow's flesh. But, fortunately, knowing he was a simpleton,  no one believed a word he said.    Another time, when the simpleton was grown a bit bigger, he again  begged money of his parents: this time that he might get him  a wife. And since he would not take a refusal, he got his sixteen  rupees and set out afresh in search of a wife. Finally, he went and  sat at a place where the village women drew water. And when a pretty  maiden came down with her vessel on her hip to draw water, he seized  her and carried her off.    And when he got tired, he stopped to rest under a tree. And it  happened that a man driving a plough ox was also resting there, and  the maiden sat there crying her very eyes out for grief at having been  carried off. So the man with the ox asked the simpleton \"Where did  you get that girl? Did you have a look at her before you took her,  or didn't you?\" To which the simpleton replied \"She seemed a pretty  girl, so I put down sixteen rupees at the bathing place and carried  her off.\" On which the wise man said: \"You must be blind. The girl's  pretty enough, but don't you see that both her eyes are burst. You  clearly don't see straight. Just see how the water is flowing from  both her eyes.\" On hearing this, the simpleton offered to exchange  the girl for the ox. But the other pretended to be unwilling, till,  after much persistence on the part of the simpleton, he cried:  \"There, take it, take it!\" So the exchange was effected, and each  went on his way mightily satisfied.    And, as the simpleton went his ways, he found a man seated under a tree  having a goat with him. So he too stayed to rest. And when they stopped  to rest, the ox lay down to rest. On this, the man with the goat said:  \"That ox is not a good bargain. It will die in a day or two.\" And the  simpleton, believing this, exchanged the ox for the goat. And when he  set forth again, he met a man carrying a big bunch of plantains. So  the two sat down. And as the goat was restless and gave him no peace,  the simpleton began beating it, so that it cried Ba! ba! (now Ba in the  Kachári speech means \"carry\"). So he said \"Do you suppose a tired man  like me is going to carry you?\" And he was so angry that in disgust  he exchanged the goat for the bunch of plantains; and went on. And  as he went, he met a man cracking his fingers, and, thinking he did  it in scorn of his plantains, explained at what price he had got them.    However, he offered to give him the plantains if he would teach him  the art of cracking his fingers. So the two stayed there a long time  till the simpleton had more or less acquired the art he coveted. Then  as he went on, he suddenly forgot what he had learned. And because  he forgot it in a paddy field, he thought he must have lost it in  the paddy, and began examining the ears of paddy as a woman searches  another woman's hair for lice. And when the owner of the field came  up and asked what he was about, he said: \"I have lost a thing which  cost me sixteen rupees. Come and help me to look.\" So the two looked  together, and when, after much search, they found nothing, the other  man, in pure vexation, cracked his fingers. On which the simpleton,  crying \"I've found it! I've found it!\" went dancing away.    Presently, he stopped by a tank, and again forgot his new  acquisition. So he plunged into the mud to look for it. And a man came  up and asked what he was searching for? To which he replied \"My friend,  my friend! I have lost something very valuable. Do come and help me to  look.\" On which, the two searched until they were covered with mud; and  when they found nothing, the new-comer cracked his fingers in vexation,  and the simpleton, crying \"I've found it! I've found it!\" went gaily  cracking his fingers all the way home. And when his father and mother  saw him, they smiled at his state, and till they spoke to him did not  know who he was. And then they asked him what he had done with his  money. \"Oh!\" said he, \"first of all I bought a lovely maiden, and,  because her eyes were bad, I exchanged her for an ox; and because  there was something wrong with the ox, I got a goat in exchange;  and because the goat wanted me to carry him, I got angry and changed  him for plantains. And the plantains I gave to a man who taught me to  crack my fingers, and what else would you have me do?\" And that's all!            THE STORY OF THE SEVEN SIMPLETONS.    There were, once upon a time, seven simpletons. And once they were  going down the road, and meeting a puddle, were in great distress as  to how they should cross it. And the eldest said \"I will go first,  and you all follow, holding one another's loin cloths.\" So they  held one another's cloths and crawled through the puddle on their  hands and knees, getting very muddy and dirty in doing so. But when  they had fairly got across, the elder set to work to count; and,  as he failed to count himself, behold, there was one missing. Then  the next brother counted; and, as he, too, found one missing, they  each in turn counted. And so it became clear that one was lost;  and there they stood debating this deplorable business. Just then a  wily Brahmin came up, and asked what was the matter. And they told  him that they had been seven, but that in crossing the puddle, one  of them had been lost. On which, the Brahmin, quickly counting them,  found that they were still seven, and, judging them to be simpletons,  said to them \"My sons, if you will come to my house and work for me,  I will find you the missing man.\" To which with one accord they agreed.    Then the Brahmin split a betelnut into seven pieces and put them into  the hand of the eldest. \"Now count them,\" said he, \"and tell me how  many there be.\" And he counted and found that there were seven. \"Now  take each man a piece,\" said the Brahmin, and, behold, to each piece  there was a man. So in great joy and peace of mind they went to the  Brahmin's house to work.    And then, one day, he sent the seven simpletons out into the garden  to"]]]
