Hand  in hand, we soon set out for my training in the Himalayas.\"    Chandi and I bowed at the swami's feet, grateful for his vivid  outline of a life truly cyclonic. I felt amply repaid for the long  probationary wait in the cold parlor!    {FN6-1} SOHONG was his monastic name. He was popularly known as  the \"Tiger Swami.\"    {FN6-2} \"Prince Princess\"-so named to indicate that this beast  possessed the combined ferocity of tiger and tigress.        CHAPTER: 7    THE LEVITATING SAINT    \"I saw a yogi remain in the air, several feet above the ground,  last night at a group meeting.\" My friend, Upendra Mohun Chowdhury,  spoke impressively.    I gave him an enthusiastic smile. \"Perhaps I can guess his name.  Was it Bhaduri Mahasaya, of Upper Circular Road?\"    Upendra nodded, a little crestfallen not to be a news-bearer. My  inquisitiveness about saints was well-known among my friends; they  delighted in setting me on a fresh track.    \"The yogi lives so close to my home that I often visit him.\" My  words brought keen interest to Upendra's face, and I made a further  confidence.    \"I have seen him in remarkable feats. He has expertly mastered the  various PRANAYAMAS {FN7-1} of the ancient eightfold yoga outlined  by Patanjali. {FN7-2} Once Bhaduri Mahasaya performed the BHASTRIKA  PRANAYAMA before me with such amazing force that it seemed an actual  storm had arisen in the room! Then he extinguished the thundering  breath and remained motionless in a high state of superconsciousness.  {FN7-3} The aura of peace after the storm was vivid beyond forgetting.\"    \"I heard that the saint never leaves his home.\" Upendra's tone was  a trifle incredulous.    \"Indeed it is true! He has lived indoors for the past twenty years.  He slightly relaxes his self-imposed rule at the times of our holy  festivals, when he goes as far as his front sidewalk! The beggars  gather there, because Saint Bhaduri is known for his tender heart.\"    \"How does he remain in the air, defying the law of gravitation?\"    \"A yogi's body loses its grossness after use of certain PRANAYAMAS.  Then it will levitate or hop about like a leaping frog. Even  saints who do not practice a formal yoga {FN7-4} have been known  to levitate during a state of intense devotion to God.\"    \"I would like to know more of this sage. Do you attend his evening  meetings?\" Upendra's eyes were sparkling with curiosity.    \"Yes, I go often. I am vastly entertained by the wit in his  wisdom.  Occasionally my prolonged laughter mars the solemnity of  his gatherings. The saint is not displeased, but his disciples look  daggers!\"    On my way home from school that afternoon, I passed Bhaduri Mahasaya's  cloister and decided on a visit. The yogi was inaccessible to the  general public. A lone disciple, occupying the ground floor, guarded  his master's privacy. The student was something of a martinet; he  now inquired formally if I had an \"engagement.\" His guru put in an  appearance just in time to save me from summary ejection.    \"Let Mukunda come when he will.\" The sage's eyes twinkled. \"My rule  of seclusion is not for my own comfort, but for that of others.  Worldly people do not like the candor which shatters their delusions.  Saints are not only rare but disconcerting. Even in scripture, they  are often found embarrassing!\"    I followed Bhaduri Mahasaya to his austere quarters on the top floor,  from which he seldom stirred. Masters often ignore the panorama  of the world's ado, out of focus till centered in the ages. The  contemporaries of a sage are not alone those of the narrow present.    \"Maharishi, {FN7-5} you are the first yogi I have known who always  stays indoors.\"    \"God plants his saints sometimes in unexpected soil, lest we think  we may reduce Him to a rule!\"    The sage locked his vibrant body in the lotus posture. In his  seventies, he displayed no unpleasing signs of age or sedentary life.  Stalwart and straight, he was ideal in every respect. His face was  that of a RISHI, as described in the ancient texts. Noble-headed,  abundantly bearded, he always sat firmly upright, his quiet eyes  fixed on Omnipresence.    The saint and I entered the meditative state. After an hour, his  gentle voice roused me.    \"You go often into the silence, but have you developed ANUBHAVA?\"  {FN7-6} He was reminding me to love God more than meditation.  \"Do  not mistake the technique for the Goal.\"    He offered me some mangoes. With that good-humored wit that I found  so delightful in his grave nature, he remarked, \"People in general  are more fond of JALA YOGA (union with food) than of DHYANA YOGA  (union with God).\"    His yogic pun affected me uproariously.    \"What a laugh you have!\" An affectionate gleam came into his gaze.  His own face was always serious, yet touched with an ecstatic smile.  His large, lotus eyes held a hidden divine laughter.    \"Those letters come from far-off America.\" The sage indicated several  thick envelopes on a table. \"I correspond with a few societies  there whose members are interested in yoga. They are discovering  India anew, with a better sense of direction than Columbus! I am  glad to help them. The knowledge of yoga is free to all who will  receive, like the ungarnishable daylight.    \"What RISHIS perceived as essential for human salvation need not  be diluted for the West. Alike in soul though diverse in outer  experience, neither West nor East will flourish if some form of  disciplinary yoga be not practiced.\"    The saint held me with his tranquil eyes. I did not realize that  his speech was a veiled prophetic guidance. It is only now, as I  write these words, that I understand the full meaning in the casual  intimations he often gave me that someday I would carry India's  teachings to America.    [Illustration: BHADURI MAHASAYA, \"The Levitating Saint\" \"Sir,\"  I inquired, \"why do you not write a book on yoga for the benefit  of the world?\" \"I am training disciples,\" He replied. \"They and  their students will be living volumes, proof against the natural  disintegrations of time and the unnatural interpretations of the  critics.\"--see badhuri.jpg]    \"Maharishi, I wish you would write a book on yoga for the benefit  of the world.\"    \"I am training disciples. They and their students will be living  volumes, proof against the natural disintegrations of time and the  unnatural interpretations of the critics.\" Bhaduri's wit put me  into another gale of laughter.    I remained alone with the yogi until his disciples arrived in the  evening. Bhaduri Mahasaya entered one of his inimitable discourses.  Like a peaceful flood, he swept away the mental debris of his listeners,  floating them Godward. His striking parables were expressed in a  flawless Bengali.    This evening Bhaduri expounded various philosophical points  connected with the life of Mirabai, a medieval Rajputani princess  who abandoned her court life to seek the company of sadhus. One  great-sannyasi refused to receive her because she was a woman; her  reply brought him humbly to her feet.    \"Tell the master,\" she had said, \"that I did not know there was  any Male in the universe save God; are we all not females before  Him?\" (A scriptural conception of the Lord as the only Positive  Creative Principle, His creation being naught but a passive MAYA.)    Mirabai composed many ecstatic songs which are still treasured in  India; I translate one of them here:      \"If by bathing daily God could be realized    Sooner would I be a whale in the deep;    If by eating roots and fruits He could be known    Gladly would I choose the form of a goat;    If the counting of rosaries uncovered Him    I would say my prayers on mammoth beads;    If bowing before stone images unveiled Him    A flinty mountain I would humbly worship;    If by drinking milk the Lord could be imbibed    Many calves and children would know Him;    If abandoning one's wife would summon God    Would not thousands be eunuchs?    Mirabai knows that to find the Divine One    The only indispensable is Love.\"    Several students put rupees in Bhaduri's slippers which lay by his  side as he sat in yoga posture. This respectful offering, customary  in India, indicates that the disciple places his material goods at  the guru's feet. Grateful friends are only the Lord in disguise,  looking after His own.    \"Master, you are wonderful!\" A student, taking his leave, gazed  ardently at the patriarchal sage. \"You have renounced riches and  comforts to seek God and teach us wisdom!\" It was well-known that  Bhaduri Mahasaya had forsaken great family wealth in his early  childhood, when single-mindedly he entered the yogic path.    \"You are reversing the case!\" The saint's face held a mild rebuke.  \"I have left a few paltry rupees, a few petty pleasures, for a cosmic  empire of endless bliss. How then have I denied myself anything?  I know the joy of sharing the treasure. Is that a sacrifice? The  shortsighted worldly folk are verily the real renunciates! They  relinquish an unparalleled divine possession for a poor handful of  earthly toys!\"    I chuckled over this paradoxical view of renunciation-one which  puts the cap of Croesus on any saintly beggar, whilst transforming  all proud millionaires into unconscious martyrs.    \"The divine order arranges our future more wisely than any insurance  company.\" The master's concluding words were the realized creed  of his faith. \"The world is full of uneasy believers in an outward  security.  Their bitter thoughts are like scars on their foreheads.  The One who gave us air and milk from our first breath knows how  to provide day by day for His devotees.\"    I continued my after-school pilgrimages to the saint's door. With  silent zeal he aided me to attain ANUBHAVA. One day he moved to  Ram Mohan Roy Road, away from the neighborhood of my Gurpar Road  home. His loving disciples had built him a new hermitage, known as  \"Nagendra Math.\" {FN7-7}    Although it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7471"],[0,"The Man with Two Left Feet, and Other Stories (#13)"],[1,"l, when I heard a scratching  noise. At first I thought it was the mice working in a different place,  but, when I listened, I found that the sound came from the window.  Somebody was doing something to it from outside.    If it had been mother, she would have lifted the roof off right there,  and so should I, if it hadn't been for what the man had taught me. I  didn't think it possible that this could be the man come back, for he  had gone away and said nothing about ever seeing me again. But I didn't  bark. I stopped where I was and listened. And presently the window came  open, and somebody began to climb in.    I gave a good sniff, and I knew it was the man.    I was so delighted that for a moment I nearly forgot myself and shouted  with joy, but I remembered in time how shy he was, and stopped myself.  But I ran to him and jumped up quite quietly, and he told me to lie  down. I was disappointed that he didn't seem more pleased to see me. I  lay down.    It was very dark, but he had brought a lantern with him, and I could  see him moving about the room, picking things up and putting them in a  bag which he had brought with him. Every now and then he would stop and  listen, and then he would start moving round again. He was very quick  about it, but very quiet. It was plain that he didn't want Fred or his  father to come down and find him.    I kept thinking about this peculiarity of his while I watched him. I  suppose, being chummy myself, I find it hard to understand that  everybody else in the world isn't chummy too. Of course, my experience  at the public-house had taught me that men are just as different from  each other as dogs. If I chewed master's shoe, for instance, he used to  kick me; but if I chewed Fred's, Fred would tickle me under the ear.  And, similarly, some men are shy and some men are mixers. I quite  appreciated that, but I couldn't help feeling that the man carried  shyness to a point where it became morbid. And he didn't give himself a  chance to cure himself of it. That was the point. Imagine a man hating  to meet people so much that he never visited their houses till the  middle of the night, when they were in bed and asleep. It was silly.  Shyness has always been something so outside my nature that I suppose I  have never really been able to look at it sympathetically. I have  always held the view that you can get over it if you make an effort.  The trouble with the man was that he wouldn't make an effort. He went  out of his way to avoid meeting people.    I was fond of the man. He was the sort of person you never get to know  very well, but we had been together for quite a while, and I wouldn't  have been a dog if I hadn't got attached to him.    As I sat and watched him creep about the room, it suddenly came to me  that here was a chance of doing him a real good turn in spite of  himself. Fred was upstairs, and Fred, as I knew by experience, was the  easiest man to get along with in the world. Nobody could be shy with  Fred. I felt that if only I could bring him and the man together, they  would get along splendidly, and it would teach the man not to be silly  and avoid people. It would help to give him the confidence which he  needed. I had seen him with Bill, and I knew that he could be perfectly  natural and easy when he liked.    It was true that the man might object at first, but after a while he  would see that I had acted simply for his good, and would be grateful.    The difficulty was, how to get Fred down without scaring the man. I  knew that if I shouted he wouldn't wait, but would be out of the window  and away before Fred could get there. What I had to do was to go to  Fred's room, explain the whole situation quietly to him, and ask him to  come down and make himself pleasant.    The man was far too busy to pay any attention to me. He was kneeling in  a corner with his back to me, putting something in his bag. I seized  the opportunity to steal softly from the room.    Fred's door was shut, and I could hear him snoring. I scratched gently,  and then harder, till I heard the snores stop. He got out of bed and  opened the door.    'Don't make a noise,' I whispered. 'Come on downstairs. I want you to  meet a friend of mine.'    At first he was quite peevish.    'What's the idea,' he said, 'coming and spoiling a man's beauty-sleep?  Get out.'    He actually started to go back into the room.    'No, honestly, Fred,' I said, 'I'm not fooling you. There is a man  downstairs. He got in through the window. I want you to meet him. He's  very shy, and I think it will do him good to have a chat with you.'    'What are you whining about?' Fred began, and then he broke off  suddenly and listened. We could both hear the man's footsteps as he  moved about.    Fred jumped back into the room. He came out, carrying something. He  didn't say any more but started to go downstairs, very quiet, and I  went after him.    There was the man, still putting things in his bag. I was just going to  introduce Fred, when Fred, the silly ass, gave a great yell.    I could have bitten him.    'What did you want to do that for, you chump?' I said 'I told you he  was shy. Now you've scared him.'    He certainly had. The man was out of the window quicker than you would  have believed possible. He just flew out. I called after him that it  was only Fred and me, but at that moment a gun went off with a  tremendous bang, so he couldn't have heard me.    I was pretty sick about it. The whole thing had gone wrong. Fred seemed  to have lost his head entirely. He was behaving like a perfect ass.  Naturally the man had been frightened with him carrying on in that way.  I jumped out of the window to see if I could find the man and explain,  but he was gone. Fred jumped out after me, and nearly squashed me.    It was pitch dark out there. I couldn't see a thing. But I knew the man  could not have gone far, or I should have heard him. I started to sniff  round on the chance of picking up his trail. It wasn't long before I  struck it.    Fred's father had come down now, and they were running about. The old  man had a light. I followed the trail, and it ended at a large  cedar-tree, not far from the house. I stood underneath it and looked  up, but of course I could not see anything.    'Are you up there?' I shouted. 'There's nothing to be scared at. It was  only Fred. He's an old pal of mine. He works at the place where you  bought me. His gun went off by accident. He won't hurt you.'    There wasn't a sound. I began to think I must have made a mistake.    'He's got away,' I heard Fred say to his father, and just as he said it  I caught a faint sound of someone moving in the branches above me.    'No he hasn't!' I shouted. 'He's up this tree.'    'I believe the dog's found him, dad!'    'Yes, he's up here. Come along and meet him.'    Fred came to the foot of the tree.    'You up there,' he said, 'come along down.'    Not a sound from the tree.    'It's all right,' I explained, 'he _is_ up there, but he's very shy. Ask  him again.'    'All right,' said Fred. 'Stay there if you want to. But I'm going to  shoot off this gun into the branches just for fun.'    And then the man started to come down. As soon as he touched the ground  I jumped up at him.    'This is fine!' I said 'Here's my friend Fred. You'll like him.'    But it wasn't any good. They didn't get along together at all. They  hardly spoke. The man went into the house, and Fred went after him,  carrying his gun. And when they got into the house it was just the  same. The man sat in one chair, and Fred sat in another, and after a  long time some men came in a motor-car, and the man went away with  them. He didn't say good-bye to me.    When he had gone, Fred and his father made a great fuss of me. I  couldn't understand it. Men are so odd. The man wasn't a bit pleased  that I had brought him and Fred together, but Fred seemed as if he  couldn't do enough for me for having introduced him to the man.  However, Fred's father produced some cold ham--my favourite dish--and  gave me quite a lot of it, so I stopped worrying over the thing. As  mother used to say, 'Don't bother your head about what doesn't concern  you. The only thing a dog need concern himself with is the  bill-of-fare. Eat your bun, and don't make yourself busy about other  people's affairs.' Mother's was in some ways a narrow outlook, but she  had a great fund of sterling common sense.        II. _He Moves in Society_    It was one of those things which are really nobody's fault. It was not  the chauffeur's fault, and it was not mine. I was having a friendly  turn-up with a pal of mine on the side-walk; he ran across the road; I  ran after him; and the car came round the corner and hit me. It must  have been going pretty slow, or I should have been killed. As it was, I  just had the breath knocked out of me. You know how you feel when the  butcher catches you just as you are edging out of the shop with a bit  of meat. It was like that.    I wasn't taking much interest in things for awhile, but when I did I  found that I was the centre of a group of three--the chauffeur, a small  boy, and the small boy's nurse.    The small boy was very well-dressed, and looked delicate. He was  crying.    'Poor doggie,' he said, 'poor doggie.'    'It wasn't my fault, Master Peter,' said the chauffeur respectfully.  'He run out into the road before I seen him.'    'That's right,' I put in, for I didn't want to get the man into  trouble.    'Oh, he's not dead,' said the small boy. 'He barked.'    'He growled,' said the nurse. 'Come away, Master Peter. He might bite  you.'    Women are trying sometimes. It is almost as if they deliberately  misunderstood.    'I won't come away. I'm going to take him home with me and send for the  doctor to come and see him. He's going to be my dog.'    This sounded all right. Goodness knows I am no snob, and can rough it  when required, but I do like comfort when it comes my way, "]]]
