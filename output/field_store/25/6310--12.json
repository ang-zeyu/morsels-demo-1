Now let us talk of other matters.  The sooner you start the better, Frank; you will not have many  preparations to make. The Garibaldian outfit is a simple one--a red  shirt, trousers of any colour, but generally blue, a pair of gaiters and  one of thick, serviceable boots, a wide-awake, or, in fact, any sort of  cap with perhaps a red feather, a well-made blanket wound up and  strapped over one shoulder like a scarf, a red sash for the waist, a  cloak or great-coat strapped up and worn like a knapsack, and a spare  shirt and a pair of trousers are all the outfit that you require. You  had better take a good rifle with you, and of course a pair of pistols.  All the clothes you can buy out there, and also a sword, for no doubt  Garibaldi will put you on his staff.\"    \"In that case I shall not want the rifle, mother.\"    \"No; and if you do you can buy one there. In a town like Genoa there are  sure to be shops where English rifles can be bought, and you might have  difficulty in passing one through the customs--luggage is rigorously  examined on the frontier and at the ports. A brace of pistols, however,  would be natural enough, as any English traveller might take them for  protection against brigands if he intended to go at all out of beaten  tracks. As to the money, I shall go to the bank on Monday, and request  them to give me bills on some firm in Genoa or Turin. Garibaldi will  find no difficulty in getting them cashed. I should say that your best  course will be to go through Paris and as far as the railway is made,  then on by diligence over Mont Cenis to Turin, and after that by railway  to Genoa. In that way you will get there in three or four days, whereas  it would take you a fortnight by sea.\"    \"Then it seems to me, mother, that there is nothing at all for me to get  before I start, except a brace of pistols; but of course I must have my  clothes up from Harrow.\"    \"I will write for them at once, Frank. It would be better that you  should not go down--you would find it difficult to answer questions put  to you as to why you are leaving; and of course this enterprise of  Garibaldi must be kept a profound secret. One cannot be too prudent in a  case like this, for if a whisper got abroad the Italian government would  be compelled to stop him.\"    \"You will not see Beppo here when you come back,\" Mrs. Percival said to  Frank on Monday evening. \"I gave him notice this afternoon.\"    \"What for, mother? Anyhow, I am not sorry, for I have never liked him.\"    \"I know that you have not, Frank, and I begin to think that you were  right. My maid said to me this morning that, though she did not like to  speak against a fellow-servant, she thought it right to tell me that  when I am out of the house and before I get up of a morning he is often  in the drawing-room and dining-room, in neither of which he has any  business; and that when she went up yesterday evening--you know that she  is a very quiet walker--she came upon him standing outside the  drawing-room door when we were chatting together, and she thought,  though of this she was not quite sure, that he had his ear at the  keyhole. He knocked and came in the instant he saw her, as if he had  only that moment arrived there; but she had caught sight of him before  he saw her, and was certain that he was listening.    \"Of course, she might have been mistaken; but thinking it over, it seems  to me that she was probably right, for once or twice since he has been  here, it has struck me that the papers in my cabinet were not in  precisely the same order as I had left them. You know that I am very  methodical about such matters; still, I might each time, when I took  them out, have omitted to return them in exactly the same order as  before, though I do not think it likely that I could have done so.  However, I thought nothing of it at the time; but now that I hear that  he has been spying about the rooms and listening at the door, I cannot  but connect the two things together, and it may be that the man has been  acting as an agent for the Neapolitan government. You know, when we were  talking the matter over on Saturday, my mother suggested that it was  possible that the courier had been in league with the brigands. Possibly  he may also be an agent of the government; and there was so great a stir  made at that time that I cannot regard it as impossible, knowing how she  and I are heart and soul with the Italian patriots, that he was sent  over to watch us.\"    \"I think it not only possible but probable,\" Signora Forli put in. \"I  know that in Italy the police have spies in every household where they  suspect the owner of holding liberal opinions; and knowing that our  house was frequented by so many exiles, they may have very well placed  this man here. I regret now that at the time this man came over at your  mother's request, we listened to his plausible tale and took him into  our service, but I had not at that time any strong suspicions that the  attack on your father was a preconcerted one, and I should hardly have  mentioned the idea to your mother had it occurred to me. However, it is  of no use thinking over that now; the great point is to consider how it  will affect your plan.\"    \"In what way, signora?\" Frank asked in surprise; and Mrs. Percival  added, \"I don't see what you mean, mother.\"    \"I mean this, dear: if this man is a spy, you may be quite sure that he  has had false keys made, by which he can open your cabinet, your  drawers, and your writing-desk. It is quite probable that he knows  Garibaldi's handwriting, for, knowing that the general was a great  friend of your father, he would almost certainly be furnished with a  specimen of it; and, if that was the case, we may take it for granted  that wherever you put any letter from Garibaldi, he would get at it and  read it. That in itself can do comparatively little harm, for rumours of  the general's proposed expedition are already current. But he will know  that, immediately on receipt of that letter, you sent for Frank.  Doubtless there are other Neapolitan spies over here, and every movement  you have made since will, in that case, have been watched, and you will  have been seen to go to the bank to-day. It is not likely that they  would know how much we have drawn out, for your conversation was with  the manager in his private room; but knowing your devotion to  Garibaldi's cause, they might well suppose that the amount would be a  considerable one. We have made no secret of the fact that Frank will  start the day after to-morrow to travel in Italy for a time; and he will  guess that Frank is the bearer of this money to Garibaldi--possibly, as  it seems that he listened at the doors, he may even have heard you tell  Frank how much you were going to send. Yesterday evening we were talking  over how the bills had best be concealed, and he may have heard that  also; if he did, you may be pretty sure that they will never reach  Garibaldi, unless our plans for their concealment are changed.\"    \"You frighten me, mother.\"    \"I don't know that there is anything to be frightened about,\" the  signora said. \"I do not for a moment suppose that he contemplates any  actual attack upon Frank; though he will, I am convinced, try to get the  money--partly, no doubt, for its own sake, partly because its loss would  be a serious blow to Garibaldi. After the disappearance of his  grandfather, and the commotion there was over the death or disappearance  of his father, an attack upon Frank would appear to be a sequel of these  affairs, and would cause such general indignation that the ministry  would take the matter up in earnest, and the result would be far more  disastrous for the government of Naples than could be caused by any  amount of money reaching Garibaldi, whom they must regard as an  adventurer who could give them some trouble, but who could not hope for  success. Therefore, I do not think that there is any danger whatever of  personal injury to Frank; but I do think there is grave fear that the  money will be stolen on the way. If our suspicions are well founded as  to Beppo, no doubt two or three of these agents will travel with him. If  he stops to sleep at an hotel, his room would be entered and his coat  carried off; he may be chloroformed when in a train and searched from  head to foot; his baggage may be stolen on the way, but that would only  be the case if they do not find the bills on his person or where we  agreed last night to hide them.\"    \"I dare not let him go,\" Mrs. Percival said, in a trembling voice.    \"Why, mother,\" Frank said almost indignantly, \"you don't suppose, now  that I am warned, I shall be fool enough to let these fellows get the  best of me? I will carry a loaded pistol in each pocket; I will not  sleep in an hotel from the time I start till I have handed the bills to  Garibaldi, and will take care always to get into a carriage with several  other passengers. If I hadn't had fair warning, I dare say I should have  been robbed; but I have no fear whatever on the subject now that we have  a suspicion of what may occur. But if you think it would be safer, I do  not see why you could not send the bills by post to an hotel at Genoa.\"    Signora Forli shook her head. \"That would not do,\" she said. \"You do not  know what these Neapolitan spies are capable of.

When Sullivan appeared in the morning, I asked him about my mare,  which he informed me was doing well. I then bade him bring me hot  shaving-water, in a loud dignified tone.    'Hot shaving-water!' says he, bursting out laughing (and I confess not  without reason). 'Is it yourself you're going to shave?' said he. 'And  maybe when I bring you up the water I'll bring you up the cat too, and  you can shave her.' I flung a boot at the scoundrel's head in reply  to this impertinence, and was soon with my friends in the parlour for  breakfast. There was a hearty welcome, and the same cloth that had  been used the night before: as I recognised by the black mark of the  Irish-stew dish, and the stain left by a pot of porter at supper.    My host greeted me with great cordiality; Mrs. Fitzsimons said I was an  elegant figure for the Phoenix; and indeed, without vanity, I may say of  myself that there were worse-looking fellows in Dublin than I. I had not  the powerful chest and muscular proportion which I have since attained  (to be exchanged, alas! for gouty legs and chalk-stones in my fingers;  but 'tis the way of mortality), but I had arrived at near my present  growth of six feet, and with my hair in buckle, a handsome lace jabot  and wristbands to my shirt, and a red plush waistcoat, barred with gold,  looked the gentleman I was born. I wore my drab coat with plate  buttons, that was grown too small for me, and quite agreed with Captain  Fitzsimons that I must pay a visit to his tailor, in order to procure  myself a coat more fitting my size.    'I needn't ask whether you had a comfortable bed,' said he. 'Young Fred  Pimpleton (Lord Pimpleton's second son) slept in it for seven months,  during which he did me the honour to stay with me, and if HE was  satisfied, I don't know who else wouldn't be.'    After breakfast we walked out to see the town, and Mr. Fitzsimons  introduced me to several of his acquaintances whom we met, as his  particular young friend Mr. Redmond, of Waterford county; he also  presented me at his hatter's and tailor's as a gentleman of great  expectations and large property; and although I told the latter that I  should not pay him ready cash for more than one coat, which fitted me to  a nicety, yet he insisted upon making me several, which I did not care  to refuse. The Captain, also, who certainly wanted such a renewal of  raiment, told the tailor to send him home a handsome military frock,  which he selected.    Then we went home to Mrs. Fitzsimons, who drove out in her chair to the  Phoenix Park, where a review was, and where numbers of the young gentry  were round about her; to all of whom she presented me as her preserver  of the day before. Indeed, such was her complimentary account of me,  that before half-an-hour I had got to be considered as a young gentleman  of the highest family in the land, related to all the principal  nobility, a cousin of Captain Fitzsimons, and heir to L10,000 a year.  Fitzsimons said he had ridden over every inch of my estate; and  'faith, as he chose to tell these stories for me, I let him have his  way--indeed, was not a little pleased (as youth is) to be made much of,  and to pass for a great personage. I had little notion then that I  had got among a set of impostors--that Captain Fitzsimons was only an  adventurer, and his lady a person of no credit; but such are the dangers  to which youth is perpetually subject, and hence let young men take  warning by me.    I purposely hurry over the description of my life in which the incidents  were painful, of no great interest except to my unlucky self, and of  which my companions were certainly not of a kind befitting my quality.  The fact was, a young man could hardly have fallen into worse hands than  those in which I now found myself. I have been to Donegal since,  and have never seen the famous Castle of Fitzsimonsburgh, which is,  likewise, unknown to the oldest inhabitants of that county; nor are the  Granby Somersets much better known in Worcestershire. The couple into  whose hands I had fallen were of a sort much more common then than at  present, for the vast wars of later days have rendered it very difficult  for noblemen's footmen or hangers-on to procure commissions; and such,  in fact, had been the original station of Captain Fitzsimons. Had  I known his origin, of course I would have died rather than have  associated with him: but in those simple days of youth I took his tales  for truth, and fancied myself in high luck at being, at my outset into  life, introduced into such a family. Alas! we are the sport of destiny.  When I consider upon what small circumstances all the great events of my  life have turned, I can hardly believe myself to have been anything  but a puppet in the hands of Fate; which has played its most fantastic  tricks upon me.    The Captain had been a gentleman's gentleman, and his lady of no higher  rank. The society which this worthy pair kept was at a sort of ordinary  which they held, and at which their friends were always welcome on  payment of a certain moderate sum for their dinner. After dinner, you  may be sure that cards were not wanting, and that the company who played  did not play for love merely. To these parties persons of all sorts  would come: young bloods from the regiments garrisoned in Dublin: young  clerks from the Castle; horse-riding, wine-tippling, watchman-beating  men of fashion about town, such as existed in Dublin in that day more  than in any other city with which I am acquainted in Europe. I never  knew young fellows make such a show, and upon such small means. I never  knew young gentlemen with what I may call such a genius for idleness;  and whereas an Englishman with fifty guineas a year is not able to do  much more than starve, and toil like a slave in a profession, a young  Irish buck with the same sum will keep his horses, and drink his bottle,  and live as lazy as a lord. Here was a doctor who never had a patient,  cheek by jowl with an attorney who never had a client: neither had  a guinea--each had a good horse to ride in the Park, and the best of  clothes to his back. A sporting clergyman without a living; several  young wine-merchants, who consumed much more liquor than they had or  sold; and men of similar character, formed the society at the house  into which, by ill luck, I was thrown. What could happen to a man but  misfortune from associating with such company?--(I have not mentioned  the ladies of the society, who were, perhaps, no better than the  males)--and in a very very short time I became their prey.    As for my poor twenty guineas, in three days I saw, with terror, that  they had dwindled down to eight: theatres and taverns having already  made such cruel inroads in my purse. At play I had lost, it is true, a  couple of pieces; but seeing that every one round about me played upon  honour and gave their bills, I, of course, preferred that medium to the  payment of ready money, and when I lost paid on account.    With the tailors, saddlers, and others, I employed similar means; and  in so far Mr. Fitzsimons's representation did me good, for the tradesmen  took him at his word regarding my fortune (I have since learned that the  rascal pigeoned several other young men of property), and for a little  time supplied me with any goods I might be pleased to order. At length,  my cash running low, I was compelled to pawn some of the suits with  which the tailor had provided me; for I did not like to part with my  mare, on which I daily rode in the Park, and which I loved as the  gift of my respected uncle. I raised some little money, too, on a few  trinkets which I had purchased of a jeweller who pressed his credit upon  me; and thus was enabled to keep up appearances for yet a little time.    I asked at the post-office repeatedly for letters for Mr. Redmond, but  none such had arrived; and, indeed, I always felt rather relieved when  the answer of 'No' was given to me; for I was not very anxious that my  mother should know my proceedings in the extravagant life which I was  leading at Dublin. It could not last very long, however; for when my  cash was quite exhausted, and I paid a second visit to the tailor,  requesting him to make me more clothes, the fellow hummed and ha'd, and  had the impudence to ask payment for those already supplied: on which,  telling him I should withdraw my custom from him, I abruptly left him.  The goldsmith too (a rascal Jew) declined to let me take a gold chain  to which I had a fancy; and I felt now, for the first time, in some  perplexity. To add to it, one of the young gentlemen who frequented Mr.  Fitzsimons's boarding-house had received from me, in the way of play,  an IOU for eighteen pounds (which I lost to him at piquet), and which,  owing Mr. Curbyn, the livery-stable keeper, a bill, he passed into that  person's hands. Fancy my rage and astonishment, then, on going for my  mare, to find that he positively refused to let me have her out of the  stable, except under payment of my promissory note! It was in vain that  I offered him his choice of four notes that I had in my pocket--one of  Fitzsimons's for L20, one of Counsellor Mulligan's, and so forth; the  dealer, who was a Yorkshireman, shook his head, and laughed at every one  of them; and said, 'I tell you what, Master Redmond, you appear a young  fellow of birth and fortune, and let me whisper in your ear that you  have fallen into very bad hands--it's a regular gang of swindlers; and a  gentleman of your rank and quality should never be seen in such company.  Go home: pack up your valise, pay the little trifle to me, mount your  mare, and ride back again to your parents,--it's the very best thing you  can do.'    In a pretty nest of villains, indeed, was I plunged! It seemed as if  all my misfortunes were to break on me at once; for, on going"]]]
