I'd like to get home  again, I'm sure.\"    No one replied to this, because they found they needed all their breath  for the climb.  The stairs had become narrower and Zeb and the Wizard  often had to help Jim pull the buggy from one step to another, or keep  it from jamming against the rocky walls.    At last, however, a dim light appeared ahead of them, which grew  clearer and stronger as they advanced.    \"Thank goodness we're nearly there!\" panted the little Wizard.    Jim, who was in advance, saw the last stair before him and stuck his  head above the rocky sides of the stairway.  Then he halted, ducked  down and began to back up, so that he nearly fell with the buggy onto  the others.    \"Let's go down again!\" he said, in his hoarse voice.    \"Nonsense!\" snapped the tired Wizard.  \"What's the matter with you, old  man?\"    \"Everything,\" grumbled the horse.  \"I've taken a look at this place,  and it's no fit country for real creatures to go to.  Everything's  dead, up there--no flesh or blood or growing thing anywhere.\"    \"Never mind; we can't turn back,\" said Dorothy; \"and we don't intend to  stay there, anyhow.\"    \"It's dangerous,\" growled Jim, in a stubborn tone.    \"See here, my good steed,\" broke in the Wizard, \"little Dorothy and I  have been in many queer countries in our travels, and always escaped  without harm.  We've even been to the marvelous Land of Oz--haven't we,  Dorothy?--so we don't much care what the Country of the Gargoyles is  like.  Go ahead, Jim, and whatever happens we'll make the best of it.\"    \"All right,\" answered the horse; \"this is your excursion, and not mine;  so if you get into trouble don't blame me.\"    With this speech he bent forward and dragged the buggy up the remaining  steps.  The others followed and soon they were all standing upon a  broad platform and gazing at the most curious and startling sight their  eyes had ever beheld.    \"The Country of the Gargoyles is all wooden!\" exclaimed Zeb; and so it  was.  The ground was sawdust and the pebbles scattered around were hard  knots from trees, worn smooth in course of time.  There were odd wooden  houses, with carved wooden flowers in the front yards.  The tree-trunks  were of coarse wood, but the leaves of the trees were shavings.  The  patches of grass were splinters of wood, and where neither grass nor  sawdust showed was a solid wooden flooring.  Wooden birds fluttered  among the trees and wooden cows were browsing upon the wooden grass;  but the most amazing things of all were the wooden people--the  creatures known as Gargoyles.    These were very numerous, for the place was thickly inhabited, and a  large group of the queer people clustered near, gazing sharply upon the  strangers who had emerged from the long spiral stairway.    The Gargoyles were very small of stature, being less than three feet in  height.  Their bodies were round, their legs short and thick and their  arms extraordinarily long and stout.  Their heads were too big for  their bodies and their faces were decidedly ugly to look upon.  Some  had long, curved noses and chins, small eyes and wide, grinning mouths.  Others had flat noses, protruding eyes, and ears that were shaped like  those of an elephant.  There were many types, indeed, scarcely two  being alike; but all were equally disagreeable in appearance.  The tops  of their heads had no hair, but were carved into a variety of fantastic  shapes, some having a row of points or balls around the top, others  designs resembling flowers or vegetables, and still others having  squares that looked like waffles cut criss-cross on their heads.  They  all wore short wooden wings which were fastened to their wooden bodies  by means of wooden hinges with wooden screws, and with these wings they  flew swiftly and noiselessly here and there, their legs being of little  use to them.    This noiseless motion was one of the most peculiar things about the  Gargoyles.  They made no sounds at all, either in flying or trying to  speak, and they conversed mainly by means of quick signals made with  their wooden fingers or lips.  Neither was there any sound to be heard  anywhere throughout the wooden country.  The birds did not sing, nor  did the cows moo; yet there was more than ordinary activity everywhere.    The group of these queer creatures which was discovered clustered near  the stairs at first remained staring and motionless, glaring with evil  eyes at the intruders who had so suddenly appeared in their land.  In  turn the Wizard and the children, the horse and the kitten, examined  the Gargoyles with the same silent attention.    \"There's going to be trouble, I'm sure,\" remarked the horse.  \"Unhitch  those tugs, Zeb, and set me free from the buggy, so I can fight  comfortably.\"    \"Jim's right,\" sighed the Wizard.  \"There's going to be trouble, and my  sword isn't stout enough to cut up those wooden bodies--so I shall have  to get out my revolvers.\"    He got his satchel from the buggy and, opening it, took out two deadly  looking revolvers that made the children shrink back in alarm just to  look at.    \"What harm can the Gurgles do?\" asked Dorothy.  \"They have no weapons  to hurt us with.\"    \"Each of their arms is a wooden club,\" answered the little man, \"and  I'm sure the creatures mean mischief, by the looks of their eyes.  Even  these revolvers can merely succeed in damaging a few of their wooden  bodies, and after that we will be at their mercy.\"    \"But why fight at all, in that case?\" asked the girl.    \"So I may die with a clear conscience,\" returned the Wizard, gravely.  \"It's every man's duty to do the best he knows how; and I'm going to do  it.\"    \"Wish I had an axe,\" said Zeb, who by now had unhitched the horse.    \"If we had known we were coming we might have brought along several  other useful things,\" responded the Wizard.  \"But we dropped into this  adventure rather unexpectedly.\"    The Gargoyles had backed away a distance when they heard the sound of  talking, for although our friends had spoken in low tones their words  seemed loud in the silence surrounding them.  But as soon as the  conversation ceased, the grinning, ugly creatures arose in a flock and  flew swiftly toward the strangers, their long arms stretched out before  them like the bowsprits of a fleet of sail-boats.  The horse had  especially attracted their notice, because it was the biggest and  strangest creature they had ever seen; so it became the center of their  first attack.    But Jim was ready for them, and when he saw them coming he turned his  heels toward them and began kicking out as hard as he could.  Crack!  crash! bang! went his iron-shod hoofs against the wooden bodies of the  Gargoyles, and they were battered right and left with such force that  they scattered like straws in the wind.  But the noise and clatter  seemed as dreadful to them as Jim's heels, for all who were able  swiftly turned and flew away to a great distance.  The others picked  themselves up from the ground one by one and quickly rejoined their  fellows, so for a moment the horse thought he had won the fight with  ease.    But the Wizard was not so confident.    \"Those wooden things are impossible to hurt,\" he said, \"and all the  damage Jim has done to them is to knock a few splinters from their  noses and ears.  That cannot make them look any uglier, I'm sure, and  it is my opinion they will soon renew the attack.\"    \"What made them fly away?\" asked Dorothy.    \"The noise, of course.  Don't you remember how the Champion escaped  them by shouting his battle-cry?\"    \"Suppose we escape down the stairs, too,\" suggested the boy.  \"We have  time, just now, and I'd rather face the invis'ble bears than those  wooden imps.\"    \"No,\" returned Dorothy, stoutly, \"it won't do to go back, for then we  would never get home.  Let's fight it out.\"    \"That is what I advise,\" said the Wizard.  \"They haven't defeated us  yet, and Jim is worth a whole army.\"    But the Gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the next  time.  They advanced in a great swarm, having been joined by many more  of their kind, and they flew straight over Jim's head to where the  others were standing.    The Wizard raised one of his revolvers and fired into the throng of his  enemies, and the shot resounded like a clap of thunder in that silent  place.    Some of the wooden beings fell flat upon the ground, where they  quivered and trembled in every limb; but most of them managed to wheel  and escape again to a distance.    Zeb ran and picked up one of the Gargoyles that lay nearest to him.  The top of its head was carved into a crown and the Wizard's bullet had  struck it exactly in the left eye, which was a hard wooden knot.  Half  of the bullet stuck in the wood and half stuck out, so it had been the  jar and the sudden noise that had knocked the creature down, more than  the fact that it was really hurt.  Before this crowned Gargoyle had  recovered himself Zeb had wound a strap several times around its body,  confining its wings and arms so that it could not move.  Then, having  tied the wooden creature securely, the boy buckled the strap and tossed  his prisoner into the buggy.  By that time the others had all retired.          12.  A Wonderful Escape      For a while the enemy hesitated to renew"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4204"],[0,"The Elements of Geology (#13)"],[1,"is seven and one half feet  to the mile, but, as in all ungraded rivers, the descent is far  from uniform. Graded reaches in soft rock alternate with steeper  declivities in hard rock, forming rapids such as, for example, a  stretch of ten miles where the fall averages twenty-one feet to  the mile. Because of these dangerous rapids the few exploring  parties who have traversed the Colorado canyon have done so at the  hazard of their lives.    The canyon has been shaped by several agencies. Its depth is due  to the river which has sawed its way far toward the base of a  lofty rising plateau. Acting alone this would have produced a  slitlike gorge little wider than the breadth of the stream. The  impressive width of the canyon and the magnificent architectural  masses which fill it are owing to two causes.: Running water has  gulched the walls and weathering has everywhere attacked and  driven them back. The horizontal harder beds stand out in long  lines of vertical cliffs, often hundreds of feet in height, at  whose feet talus slopes conceal the outcrop of the weaker strata.  As the upper cliffs have been sapped and driven back by the  weather, broad platforms are left at their bases and the sides of  the canyon descend to the river by gigantic steps. Far up and down  the canyon the eye traces these horizontal layers, like the  flutings of an elaborate molding, distinguishing each by its  contour as well as by its color and thickness.    The Grand Canyon of the Colorado is often and rightly cited as an  example of the stupendous erosion which may be accomplished by a  river. And yet the Colorado is a young stream and its work is no  more than well begun. It has not yet wholly reached grade, and the  great task of the river and its tributaries--the task of leveling  the lofty plateau to a low plain and of transporting it grain by  grain to the sea--still lies almost entirely in the future.    WATERFALLS AND RAPIDS. Before the bed of a stream is reduced to  grade it may be broken by abrupt descents which give rise to  waterfalls and rapids. Such breaks in a river's bed may belong to  the initial surface over which it began its course; still more  commonly are they developed in the rock mass through which it is  cutting its valley. Thus, wherever a stream leaves harder rocks to  flow over softer ones the latter are quickly worn below the level  of the former, and a sharp change in slope, with a waterfall or  rapid, results.    At time of flood young tributaries with steeper courses than that  of the trunk stream may bring down stones and finer waste, which  the gentler current cannot move along, and throw them as a dam  across its way. The rapids thus formed are also ephemeral, for as  the gradient of the tributaries is lowered the main stream becomes  able to handle the smaller and finer load which they discharge.    A rare class of falls is produced where the minor tributaries of a  young river are not able to keep pace with their master stream in  the erosion of their beds because of their smaller volume, and  thus join it by plunging over the side of its gorge. But as the  river approaches grade and slackens its down cutting, the  tributaries sooner or later overtake it, and effacing their falls,  unite with it on a level.    Waterfalls and rapids of all kinds are evanescent features of a  river's youth. Like lakes they are soon destroyed, and if any long  time had already elapsed since their formation they would have  been obliterated already.    LOCAL BASELEVELS. That balanced condition called grade, where a  river neither degrades its bed by erosion nor aggrades it by  deposition, is first attained along reaches of soft rocks,  ungraded outcrops of hard rocks remaining as barriers which give  rise to rapids or falls. Until these barriers are worn away they  constitute local baselevels, below which level the stream, up  valley from them, cannot cut. They are eroded to grade one after  another, beginning with the least strong, or the one nearest the  mouth of the stream. In a similar way the surface of a lake in a  river's course constitutes for all inflowing streams a local  baselevel, which disappears when the basin is filled or drained.    MATURE AND OLD RIVERS    Maturity is the stage of a river's complete development and most  effective work. The river system now has well under way its great  task of wearing down the land mass which it drains and carrying it  particle by particle to the sea. The relief of the land is now at  its greatest; for the main channels have been sunk to grade, while  the divides remain but little worn below their initial altitudes.  Ground water now stands low. The run-off washes directly to the  streams, with the least delay and loss by evaporation in ponds and  marches; the discharge of the river is therefore at its height.  The entire region is dissected by stream ways. The area of valley  slopes is now largest and sheds to the streams a heavier load of  waste than ever before. At maturity the river system is doing its  greatest amount of work both in erosion and in the carriage of  water and of waste to the sea.    LATERAL EROSION. On reaching grade a river ceases to scour its  bed, and it does not again begin to do so until some change in  load or volume enables it to find grade at a lower level. On the  other hand, a stream erodes its banks at all stages in its  history, and with graded rivers this process, called lateral  erosion, or PLANATION, is specially important. The current of a  stream follows the outer side of all curves or bends in the  channel, and on this side it excavates its bed the deepest and  continually wears and saps its banks. On the inner side deposition  takes place in the more shallow and slower-moving water. The inner  bank of bends is thus built out while the outer bank is worn away.  By swinging its curves against the valley sides a graded river  continually cuts a wider and wider floor. The V-valley of youth is  thus changed by planation to a flat-floored valley with flaring  sides which gradually become subdued by the weather to gentle  slopes. While widening their valleys streams maintain a constant  width of channel, so that a wide-floored valley does not signify  that it ever was occupied by a river of equal width.    THE GRADIENT. The gradients of graded rivers differ widely. A  large river with a light load reaches grade on a faint slope,  while a smaller stream heavily burdened with waste requires a  steep slope to give it velocity sufficient to move the load.    The Platte, a graded river of Nebraska with its headwaters in the  Rocky Mountains, is enfeebled by the semi-arid climate of the  Great Plains and surcharged with the waste brought down both by  its branches in the mountains and by those whose tracks lie over  the soft rocks of the plains. It is compelled to maintain a  gradient of eight feet to the mile in western Nebraska. The Ohio  reaches grade with a slope of less than four inches to the mile  from Cincinnati to its mouth, and the powerful Mississippi washes  along its load with a fall of but three inches per mile from Cairo  to the Gulf.    Other things being equal, which of graded streams will have the  steeper gradient, a trunk stream or its tributaries? a stream  supplied with gravel or one with silt?    Other factors remaining the same, what changes would occur if the  Platte should increase in volume? What changes would occur if the  load should be increased in amount or in coarseness?    THE OLD AGE OF RIVERS. As rivers pass their prime, as denudation  lowers the relief of the region, less waste and finer is washed  over the gentler slopes of the lowering hills. With smaller loads  to carry, the rivers now deepen their valleys and find grade with  fainter declivities nearer the level of the sea. This limit of the  level of the sea beneath which they cannot erode is known as  baselevel. [Footnote: The term \"baselevel\" is also used to  designate the close approximation to sea level to which streams  are able to subdue the land.] As streams grow old they approach  more and more closely to baselevel, although they are never able  to attain it. Some slight slope is needed that water may flow and  waste be transported over the land. Meanwhile the relief of the  land has ever lessened. The master streams and their main  tributaries now wander with sluggish currents over the broad  valley floors which they have planed away; while under the erosion  of their innumerable branches and the wear of the weather the  divides everywhere are lowered and subdued to more and more gentle  slopes. Mountains and high plateaus are thus reduced to rolling  hills, and at last to plains, surmounted only by such hills as may  still be unreduced to the common level, because of the harder  rocks of which they are composed or because of their distance from  the main erosion channels. Such regions of faint relief, worn down  to near base level by subaerial agencies, are known as PENEPLAINS  (almost plains). Any residual masses which rise above them are  called MONADNOCKS, from the name of a conical peak of New  Hampshire which overlooks the now uplifted peneplain of southern  New England.    In its old age a region becomes mantled with thick sheets of fine  and weathered waste, slowly moving over the faint slopes toward  the water ways and unbroken by ledges of bare rock. In other  words, the waste mantle also is now graded, and as waterfalls have  been effaced in the river beds, so now any ledges in the wide  streams of waste are worn away and covered beneath smooth slopes  of fine soil. Ground water stands high and may exude in areas of  swamp. In youth the land mass was roughhewn and cut deep by stream  erosion. In old age the faint reliefs of the land dissolve away,  chiefly under the action of the weather, beneath their cloak of  waste.    THE CYCLE OF EROSION.
