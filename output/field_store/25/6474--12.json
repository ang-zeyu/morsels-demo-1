The female  cannibal beholding the queens in that condition and the king too so  desirous of an offspring, and the child was possessed of such strength  thought within herself--I live within dominions of the king who is so  desirous of an offspring. It behoveth not me, therefore, to kill the  infant child of such an illustrious and virtuous monarch. The Rakshasa  woman then, holding the child in her arms like the clouds enveloping  the sun, and assuming a human form, told the king these words,--\"O  Vrihadratha, this is thy child. Given to thee by me, O, take it. It  hath been born of both thy wives by virtue of the command of the great  Brahmana. Cast away by the midwives, it hath been protected by me!\"'    \"Krishna continued,--'O thou foremost of the Bharata race, the handsome  daughters of the king of Kasi, having obtained the child, soon drenched  it with their lacteal streams. The king ascertaining everything, was  filled with joy, and addressing that female cannibal disguised as a  human being possessing the complexion of gold, asked,--O thou of the  complexion of the filament of the lotus, who art thou that givest me  this child? O auspicious one, thou seemest to me as a goddess roaming  at thy pleasure!'      SECTION XVIII    \"Krishna continued,--'Hearing these words of the king, the Rakshasa  woman answered--\"Blessed be thou, O king of kings. Capable of assuming  any form at will, I am a Rakshasa woman called Jara. I am living, O  king, happily in thy house, worshipped by all. Every day I wander from  house to house of men. Indeed, I was created of old by the Self-create  and was named Grihadevi (the household goddess). Of celestial beauty I  was placed (in the world) for the destruction of the Danavas. He that  with devotion painteth on the walls (of his house) a likeness of myself  endued with youth and in the midst of children, must have prosperity in  his abode; otherwise a household must sustain decay and destruction. O  lord, painted on the walls of thy house is a likeness of myself  surrounded by numerous children. Stationed there I am daily worshipped  with scents and flowers, with incense and edibles and various objects  of enjoyment. Thus worshipped in thy house, I daily think of doing thee  some good in return. It chanced, O virtuous king, that I beheld the  fragmentary bodies of thy son. When these happened to be united by me,  a living child was formed of them. O great king, it hath been so owing  to thy good fortune alone. I have been only the instrument, I am  capable of swallowing the mountain of Meru itself, what shall I say of  the child? I have, however, been gratified with thee in consequence of  the worship I receive in thy house. It is, therefore, O king, that I  have bestowed this child on thee.\"'    \"Krishna continued,--'Having spoken these words, O king, Jara  disappeared there and then. The king having obtained the child then  entered the palace. And the king then caused all the rites of infancy  to be performed on that child, and ordered a festival to be observed by  his people in honour of that Rakshasa woman. And the monarch equal unto  Brahma himself then bestowed a name on his child. And he said that  because the child had been united by Jara, he should be called  (Jarasandha i.e., united by Jara). And the son of the king of Magadha  endued with great energy, began to grow up in bulk and strength like a  fire into which hath been poured libation of clarified butter. And  increasing day by day like the moon in the bright fortnight, the child  began to enhance the joy of his parents.'      SECTION XIX    \"Krishna said,--'some time after this, the great ascetic, the exalted  Chandakausika, again came into the country of the Magadhas. Filled with  joy at the advent of the Rishi, king Vrihadratha, accompanied by his  ministers and priest and wives and son, went out to receive him. And, O  Bharata, worshipping the Rishi with water to wash his feet and face,  and with the offerings of Arghya the king then offered his whole  kingdom along with his son for the acceptance of the Rishi. The  adorable Rishi accepting that worship offered by the king, addressing  the ruler of Magadha, O monarch, said with well-pleased heart,--\"O  king, I knew all this by spiritual insight. But hear, O king of kings,  what this son of thine will be in future, as also what his beauty,  excellence, strength, and valour will be. Without doubt this son of  thine, growing in prosperity and endued with prowess, will obtain all  these. Like other birds that can never imitate the speed of Vinata's  son (Garuda), the other monarchs of the earth will not be able to equal  in energy this thy son, who will be endued with great valour. And all  those that will stand in his way will certainly be destroyed. Like the  force of the current that can never make the slightest impression upon  the rocky breast of a mountain, weapons hurled at him even by the  celestials will fail to produce the least pain in him. He will blaze  forth above the heads of all that wear crowns on their brows. Like the  sun that dims the lustre of all luminous bodies, this son of thine will  rob all monarchs of their splendour. Even kings that are powerful and  own large armies and numberless vehicles and animals, upon approaching  this son of thine, will all perish as insects upon fire. This child  will seize the growing prosperity of all kings like the ocean receiving  the rivers swollen with the water of the rainy season. Like the huge  earth that bears all kinds of produce, supporting things that are both  good and evil, this child endued with great strength will support all  the four orders of men. And all the kings of the earth will live in  obedience to the commands of this child just as every creature endued  with body live in dependence upon Vayu that is dear as self unto  beings. This prince of Magadha--the mightiest of all men in the  world--will behold with his physical eyes the god of gods called Rudra  or Hara, the slayer of Tripura.\" O thou slayer of all foes, saying  this, the Rishi, thinking of his own business, dismissed king  Vrihadratha. The lord of the Magadhas then, re-entering his capital,  and calling together his friends and relations, installed Jarasandha,  on the throne. King Vrihadratha then came to feel a great distaste for  worldly pleasures. And after the installation of Jarasandha king  Vrihadratha followed by his two wives became an inmate of an ascetic  asylum in the woods. And, O king, after his father and mothers had  retired into the woods, Jarasandha by his valour brought numerous kings  under his sway.'\"    Vaisampayana continued,--\"King Vrihadratha, having lived for some time  in the woods and practised ascetic penances, ascended to heaven at last  with his wives. King Jarasandha, also, as uttered by Kausika, having  received those numerous boons ruled his kingdom like a father. Some  time after when king Kansa was slain by Vasudeva, an enmity arose  between him and Krishna. Then, O Bharata, the mighty king of Magadha  from his city of Girivraja, whirling a mace ninety-nine times, hurled  it towards Mathura. At that time Krishna of wonderful deeds was  residing at Mathura. The handsome mace hurled by Jarasandha fell near  Mathura at a distance of ninety-nine yojanas from Gririvraja. The  citizens beholding the circumstance well, went unto Krishna and  informed him of the fall of the mace. The place where the mace fell is  adjacent to Mathura and is called Gadavasan. Jarasandha had two  supporters called Hansa and Dimvaka, both of whom were incapable of  being slain by weapons. Well-conversant with the science of politics  and morality, in counsel they were the foremost of all intelligent men.  I have already told thee everything about that mighty pair. They two  and Jarasandha, I believe, are more than a match for three worlds. O  brave king, it was for this reason that the powerful Kukkura, Andhaka  and Vrishni tribes, acting from motives of policy, did not deem it  proper to fight with him.      SECTION XX    (Jarasandhta-badha Parva)    \"Krishna said,--'both Hansa and Dimvaka have fallen; Kansa also with  all his followers has been slain. The time hath, therefore come for the  destruction of Jarasandha. He is incapable of being vanquished in  battle even by all the celestials and the Asuras (fighting together).  We think, however, that he should be vanquished in a personal struggle  with bare arms. In me is policy, in Bhima is strength and in Arjuna is  triumph; and therefore, as prelude to performing the Rajasuya, we will  certainly achieve the destruction of the ruler of Magadha. When we  three approach that monarch in secret, and he will, without doubt, be  engaged in an encounter with one of us. From fear of disgrace, from  covetousness, and from pride of strength he will certainly summon Bhima  to the encounter. Like death himself that slays a person however  swollen with pride, the long-armed and mighty Bhimasena will effect the  destruction of the king. If thou knowest my heart, if thou hast any  faith in me, then make over to me, as a pledge, Bhima and Arjuna  without loss of time!'\"    Vaisampayana continued,--\"Thus addressed by the exalted one,  Yudhishthira, beholding both Bhima and Arjuna standing with cheerful  faces, replied, saying--'O Achyuta, O Achyuta, thou slayer of all  enemies, say not so. Thou art the lord of the Pandavas! We are  dependent on thee. What thou sayest, O Govinda, is consistent with wise  counsels. Thou never leadest those upon whom Prosperity hath turned her  back. I who stay under thy command regard that Jarasandha is already  slain, that the monarchs confined by him have already been set free,  that the Rajasuya hath already been accomplished by me. O lord of the  universe, O thou best of persons, watchfully act thou so that this task  may be accomplished.

When it was thought that they were in a  proper position, the white men all at once uncovered the supposed goods,  which was a large cannon, and being prepared to shoot in a line with the  cord it was at once fired and roared like thunder. In a moment the ground  along the cord was strewn with the meats of the Tuscaroras. This is one  of the effects of the treaty at that time.    I will copy a report of Governor Spotswood to the Lords Commissioners of  Trade, in the year 1711, to-wit:    \"Had they,\" said he, \"really intended to carry on the war against the  Indians, they could not have done it in a more frugal way than by the  treaty I concluded with the Tuscarora chiefs.    \"Indeed, some of that house, since the dissolution, own more freely than  they would do while sitting, that most of the irregularities of their  proceedings are owing to some rash votes, passed without foresight, which  they could not afterwards get over without breaking the rules of their  house; and so they chose, rather, to let the country suffer than to own  themselves in an error.    \"Some of the Tuscarora chiefs have lately been with Governor Spotswood,  of Virginia, and pretend a great inclination to peace.    \"They are again to be with him on the 26th of this month; we are to send  two agents to meet them there--Mr. Tobias Knight and Mayor Christophe  Gale--not with any expectation that the Governor will make any treaty for  us, for that would be dishonorable to your lordship and make us appear  contemptible in the eyes of the Indians, but with a view to hear what  they have to propose.\"    I might quote many more passages similar to those above, but let these  few suffice to show how the Tuscaroras were treated. Now, finally, with a  combination of causes, they were in 1713, crushed and broken down as a  nation, to satisfy the inclinations of the white people, persecutions  being kept up by neighboring whites and southern Indians until June  following. The Oneida Indians, having heard of the disaster to the  Tuscarora Nation, invited them to come and make their dwelling among  them: so, accordingly, they left Carolina and took their journey north to  rejoin their sister nations.    Methink I can see them leaving their once cherished homes--the aged, the  helpless, the women and children, and the warriors faint and few--the  ashes are cold on their native hearth; the smoke no more curls round  their lowly cabin: they move on with slow, unsteady steps; they turn to  take a last look upon their doomed village and cast a last glance upon  the long cherished memories of their fathers' graves. They shed no tears;  they utter no cries: they heave no groans, they linger but a moment. They  know and feel that there is for them still one more remove further, not  distant nor unseen.    One bright, sunny June morning, in the year 1813, was one of the darkest  days that the Tuscaroras ever witnessed, when most of the nation took  their pace to the north until they came within the bounds of the Oneida  domain, about two miles west of Tamaqua, in the state of Pennsylvania,  where they located and set out apple trees which can be seen to this day:  some of the trees, will measure about two feet in diameter. Here they  dwelled for about two years.    In about the year 1815, the Iroquois, being the Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca,  Oneida and Cayuga nations, which were then called the five nations, had a  general council where the Tuscarora made an application through their  brothers the Oneida, to be admitted into the Iroquois and become the  sixth nation, on the grounds of a common generic origin, which was  granted them unanimously. Then the Seneca adopted the Tuscarora as their  children. Ever since that time to the present, if a Seneca addresses the  Tuscaroras, he will invariably salute them as \"my sons,\" in social or in  council; and also the Tuscaroras in return will say \"my fathers.\" The  relation has always been kept up to the present.    The Tuscaroras were then initiated without enlarging the frame-work of  the confederacy and formation of the League, by allowing them their own  Sachems and Chiefs, which they had as hereditary from their nation in the  south, except on which they gave, as the Holder of the Tree, to sit and  enjoy a nominal equality in the councils of the League, by the courtesy  of the other five nations. They were not dependent, but were admitted to  as full an equality as could be granted them without enlarging the frame-  work of the confederacy. In the councils of the League they had no  national designation. They were then assigned a portion of the Oneidas'  territory, which is lying upon the Unadilla river on the east, the  Chenango on the west, and the Susquehanna on the south, where they  dwelled and enjoyed their peace again for about seventy years. In 1736  they numbered 200 warriors of fighting men.    We again hear of the Tuscarora by history, concerning a massacre of the  German Flats, N. Y., in November, 1757.    A narrative communicated to the author of the Documentary History of New  York, vol. 2, page 520, viz: A few days after this massacre and  desolation had been perpetrated, Sir William Johnson dispatched Geo.  Croghan, Esq., Deputy Agent, with Mr. Montour, the Indian interpreter, to  the German Flats, where he understood several of the Oneida and Tuscarora  Indians were assembled, in order to call upon them to explain why they  had not given more timely notice to the Germans of the designs and  approach of the enemy, it having been reported that no intelligence had  been given by the Indians until the same morning the attack was made, and  as these Indians might naturally be supposed, from their situation and  other circumstances, to have had an earlier knowledge of the enemy's  design and march.    Before Mr. Croghan could get up to the German Flats the aforesaid Indians  were on their road homewards, but he was informed that the Chief Sachem  of the Upper Oneida town, with a Tuscarora Sachem (which is supposed to  be Solomon Longboard) and another Oneida Indian, were still about four  miles from Fort Harkeman, upon which he sent a messenger to acquaint them  that he was at the said fort.    The aforesaid Indians returned, and on the 3oth of November, at Fort  Harkeman, Conaghquieson, the Oneida Sachem, made the following speech to  Mr. Croghan, having first called in one Rudolph Shumaker, Hanjost Harkman  and several other Germans who understood the Indian language, and desired  them to sit down and hear what he had to say. Conaghquieson then  proceeded and said:    \"Brothers:--I can't help telling you that we were very much surprised to  hear that our English brethren suspect and charge us with not giving them  timely notice of the designs of the French, as it is well known we have  not neglected to give them every piece of intelligence that came to our  knowledge.    \"Brothers, about fifteen days before the affair happened we sent the  Germans word that some Swegatchi Indians told us that the French were  determined to destroy the German Flats, and desired them to be on their  guard. About six days after that we had a further account from the  Swegatchi Indians that the French were preparing to march.    \"I then came to the German Flats, and in a meeting with the Germans told  them what we had heard, and desired to collect themselves together in a  body at their fort, [Footnote: A stockaded work round the church, and a  block-house, with a ditch, and a parapet thrown up by Sir William  Johnson, a year ago, upon an alarm then given.] and secure their women,  children and effects, and to make the best defence they could. At the  same time I told them to write what I had said to our brother,  Warraghryagey (meaning Sir William Johnson [Footnote: They never sent  this intelligence to Sir William Johnson.]), but they paid not the least  regard to what I told them, and laughed at me, slapping their hands on  their buttocks, saying they did not value the enemy, upon which I  returned home and sent one of our people to the lake (meaning Oneida  Lake) to find out whether the enemy were coming or not. After he had  staid there two days the enemy arrived at the carrying-place, and sent  word to the castle at the lake that they were there, and told them what  they were going to do, but charged them not to let us at the upper castle  know anything of their design. As soon as the man I sent there heard this  he came on to us with the account that night; and as soon as we received  it we sent a belt of wampum, to confirm the truth thereof, to the Flats,  which came here the day before the enemy made their attack: but the  people would not give credit to the account even then, or they might have  saved their lives. [Footnote: The Indians who brought the belt of wampum,  finding the Germans still incredulous, the next morning, just before the  attack began, laid hold on the German Minister, and in a manner forced  him over to the other side of the river, by which means he and some who  followed him escaped the fate of their brethren.] This is the truth, and  those Germans here present know it to be so. The aforesaid Germans did  acknowledge it to be so, and that they had such intelligence.    \"GEORGE CROGHAN.\"    The Oneida being the original owner of the tract of land assigned to the  Tuscarora as aforesaid, were made party with the Tuscarora to the treaty  made at Fort Herkimer in the year 1785, by which it was ceded to the  State, and the Oneida took all the avails of the treaty.
