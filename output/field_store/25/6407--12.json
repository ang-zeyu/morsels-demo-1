Wherefore we entirely  approve the judgment of books, wherein they declared in our sixth  chapter the clerk who cannot write to be as it were disabled.    God himself inscribes the just in the book of the living; Moses  received the tables of stone written with the finger of God.  Job  desires that he himself that judgeth would write a book.  Belshazzar  trembled when he saw the fingers of a man's hand writing upon the wall,  Mene tekel phares.  I wrote, says Jeremiah, with ink in the book.  Christ bids his beloved disciple John, What thou seest write in a book.  So the office of the writer is enjoined on Isaiah and on Joshua, that  the act and skill of writing may be commended to future generations.  Christ Himself has written on His vesture and on His thigh King of  Kings and Lord of Lords, so that without writing the royal ornaments of  the Omnipotent cannot be made perfect.  Being dead they cease not to  teach, who write books of sacred learning.  Paul did more for building  up the fabric of the Church by writing his holy epistles, than by  preaching by word of mouth to Jews and Gentiles.  He who has attained  the prize continues daily by books, what he long ago began while a  sojourner upon the earth; and thus is fulfilled in the doctors writing  books the saying of the Prophet:  They that turn many to righteousness  shall be as the stars for ever and ever.    Moreover, it has been determined by the doctors of the Church that the  longevity of the ancients, before God destroyed the original world by  the Deluge, is to be ascribed to a miracle and not to nature; as though  God granted to them such length of days as was required for finding out  the sciences and writing them in books; amongst which the wonderful  variety of astronomy required, according to Josephus, a period of six  hundred years, to submit it to ocular observation.  Nor, indeed, do  they deny that the fruits of the earth in that primitive age afforded a  more nutritious aliment to men than in our modern times, and thus they  had not only a livelier energy of body, but also a more lengthened  period of vigour; to which it contributed not a little that they lived  according to virtue and denied themselves all luxurious delights.  Whoever therefore is by the good gift of God endowed with gift of  science, let him, according to the counsel of the Holy Spirit, write  wisdom in his time of leisure (Eccles.  xxxviii.), that his reward may  be with the blessed and his days may be lengthened in this present  world.    And further, if we turn our discourse to the princes of the world, we  find that famous emperors not only attained excellent skill in the art  of writing, but indulged greatly in its practice.  Julius Caesar, the  first and greatest of them all, has left us Commentaries on the Gallic  and the Civil Wars written by himself; he wrote also two books De  Analogia, and two books of Anticatones, and a poem called Iter; and  many other works.  Julius and Augustus devised means of writing one  letter for another, and so concealing what they wrote.  For Julius put  the fourth letter for the first, and so on through the alphabet; whilst  Augustus used the second for the first, the third for the second, and  so throughout.  He is said in the greatest difficulties of affairs  during the Mutinensian War to have read and written and even declaimed  every day.  Tiberius wrote a lyric poem and some Greek verses.  Claudius likewise was skilled in both Greek and Latin, and wrote  several books.  But Titus was skilled above all men in the art of  writing, and easily imitated any hand he chose; so that he used to say  that if he had wished it he might have become a most skilful forger.  All these things are noted by Suetonius in his Lives of the XII.  Caesars.        CHAPTER XVII    OF SHOWING DUE PROPRIETY IN THE CUSTODY OF BOOKS    We are not only rendering service to God in preparing volumes of new  books, but also exercising an office of sacred piety when we treat  books carefully, and again when we restore them to their proper places  and commend them to inviolable custody; that they may rejoice in purity  while we have them in our hands, and rest securely when they are put  back in their repositories.  And surely next to the vestments and  vessels dedicated to the Lord's body, holy books deserve to be rightly  treated by the clergy, to which great injury is done so often as they  are touched by unclean hands.  Wherefore we deem it expedient to warn  our students of various negligences, which might always be easily  avoided and do wonderful harm to books.    And in the first place as to the opening and closing of books, let  there be due moderation, that they be not unclasped in precipitate  haste, nor when we have finished our inspection be put away without  being duly closed.  For it behoves us to guard a book much more  carefully than a boot.    But the race of scholars is commonly badly brought up, and unless they  are bridled in by the rules of their elders they indulge in infinite  puerilities.  They behave with petulance, and are puffed up with  presumption, judging of everything as if they were certain, though they  are altogether inexperienced.    You may happen to see some headstrong youth lazily lounging over his  studies, and when the winter's frost is sharp, his nose running from  the nipping cold drips down, nor does he think of wiping it with his  pocket-handkerchief until he has bedewed the book before him with the  ugly moisture.  Would that he had before him no book, but a cobbler's  apron!  His nails are stuffed with fetid filth as black as jet, with  which he marks any passage that pleases him.  He distributes a  multitude of straws, which he inserts to stick out in different places,  so that the halm may remind him of what his memory cannot retain.  These straws, because the book has no stomach to digest them, and no  one takes them out, first distend the book from its wonted closing, and  at length, being carelessly abandoned to oblivion, go to decay.  He  does not fear to eat fruit or cheese over an open book, or carelessly  to carry a cup to and from his mouth; and because he has no wallet at  hand he drops into books the fragments that are left.  Continually  chattering, he is never weary of disputing with his companions, and  while he alleges a crowd of senseless arguments, he wets the book lying  half open in his lap with sputtering showers.  Aye, and then hastily  folding his arms he leans forward on the book, and by a brief spell of  study invites a prolonged nap; and then, by way of mending the  wrinkles, he folds back the margin of the leaves, to the no small  injury of the book.  Now the rain is over and gone, and the flowers  have appeared in our land.  Then the scholar we are speaking of, a  neglecter rather than an inspecter of books, will stuff his volume with  violets, and primroses, with roses and quatrefoil.  Then he will use  his wet and perspiring hands to turn over the volumes; then he will  thump the white vellum with gloves covered with all kinds of dust, and  with his finger clad in long-used leather will hunt line by line  through the page; then at the sting of the biting flea the sacred book  is flung aside, and is hardly shut for another month, until it is so  full of the dust that has found its way within, that it resists the  effort to close it.    But the handling of books is specially to be forbidden to those  shameless youths, who as soon as they have learned to form the shapes  of letters, straightway, if they have the opportunity, become unhappy  commentators, and wherever they find an extra margin about the text,  furnish it with monstrous alphabets, or if any other frivolity strikes  their fancy, at once their pen begins to write it.  There the Latinist  and sophister and every unlearned writer tries the fitness of his pen,  a practice that we have frequently seen injuring the usefulness and  value of the most beautiful books.    Again, there is a class of thieves shamefully mutilating books, who cut  away the margins from the sides to use as material for letters, leaving  only the text, or employ the leaves from the ends, inserted for the  protection of the book, for various uses and abuses--a kind of  sacrilege which should be prohibited by the threat of anathema.    Again, it is part of the decency of scholars that whenever they return  from meals to their study, washing should invariably precede reading,  and that no grease-stained finger should unfasten the clasps, or turn  the leaves of a book.  Nor let a crying child admire the pictures in  the capital letters, lest he soil the parchment with wet fingers; for a  child instantly touches whatever he sees.  Moreover, the laity, who  look at a book turned upside down just as if it were open in the right  way, are utterly unworthy of any communion with books.  Let the clerk  take care also that the smutty scullion reeking from his stewpots does  not touch the lily leaves of books, all unwashed, but he who walketh  without blemish shall minister to the precious volumes.  And, again,  the cleanliness of decent hands would be of great benefit to books as  well as scholars, if it were not that the itch and pimples are  characteristic of the clergy.    Whenever defects are noticed in books, they should be promptly  repaired, since nothing spreads more quickly than a tear and a rent  which is neglected at the time will have to be repaired afterwards with  usury.    Moses, the gentlest of men, teaches us to make bookcases most neatly,  wherein they may be protected from any injury: Take, he says, this book  of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the  Lord your God.   O fitting place and appropriate for a library, which  was made of imperishable shittim-wood, and was all covered within and  without with gold!

Ibrahim was made to say these words over and over again, and the red  fire in his eyes deepened as Dicky's face lighted up with what seemed a  mere mocking pleasure, a sort of impish delight in teasing, like that of  a madcap girl with a yokel. Each time Ibrahim said the words he jumbled  them worse than before. Then Dicky asked him if he knew what an old man  was, and Ibrahim said no. Dicky said softly in Arabic that the old man  was a fool to have three such sons--a thief and a rogue and a soldier.  With a tender patience he explained what a thief and a rogue were, and  his voice was curiously soft when he added, in Arabic: \"And the third  son was like you, Mahommed--and he died first.\"    Ibrahim's eyes gloomed under the raillery--under what he thought the  cackle of a detested Inglesi with a face like a girl, of an infidel who  had a tongue that handed you honey on the point of a two-edged sword.  In his heart he hated this slim small exquisite as he had never hated  Fielding. His eyes became like little pots of simmering blood, and he  showed his teeth in a hateful way, because he was sure he should glut  his hatred before the moon came full.    Little Dicky Donovan knew, as he sleepily told Ibrahim to go, that for  months the Orderly had listened to the wholesome but scathing talk of  Fielding and himself on the Egyptian Government, and had reported it to  those whose tool and spy he was.    That night, the stern-wheeled tub, the Amenhotep, lurched like a turtle  on its back into the sands by Beni Hassan. Of all the villages of Upper  Egypt, from the time of Rameses, none has been so bad as Beni Hassan.  Every ruler of Egypt, at one time or another, has raided it and razed it  to the ground. It was not for pleasure that Fielding sojourned there.    This day, and for three days past, Fielding had been abed in his cabin  with a touch of Nilotic fever. His heart was sick for Cairo, for he  had been three months on the river; and Mrs. Henshaw was in Cairo--Mrs.  Henshaw, the widow of Henshaw of the Buffs, who lived with her brother,  a stone's-throw from the Esbekieh Gardens. Fielding longed for Cairo,  but Beni Hassan intervened. The little man who worried Ibrahim urged him  the way his private inclinations ran, but he was obdurate: duty must be  done.    Dicky Donovan had reasons other than private ones for making haste to  Cairo. During the last three days they had stopped at five villages  on the Nile, and in each place Dicky, who had done Fielding's work of  inspection for him, had been met with unusual insolence from the Arabs  and fellaheen, officials and others; and the prompt chastisement he  rendered with his riding-whip in return did not tend to ease his mind,  though it soothed his feelings. There had been flying up the river  strange rumours of trouble down in Cairo, black threats of rebellion--of  a seditious army in the palm of one man's hand. At the cafes on the  Nile, Dicky himself had seen strange gatherings, which dispersed as he  came on them. For, somehow, his smile had the same effect as other men's  frowns.    This evening he added a whistle to his smile as he made his inspection  of the engine-room and the galley and every corner of the Amenhotep,  according to his custom. What he whistled no man knew, not even himself.  It was ready-made. It might have been a medley, but, as things happened,  it was an overture; and by the eyes, the red-litten windows of the mind  of Mahommed Ibrahim, who squatted beside the Yorkshire engineer at the  wheel, playing mankalah, he knew it was an overture.    As he went to his cabin he murmured to himself \"There's the devil to  pay: now I wonder who pays?\" Because he was planning things of moment,  he took a native drum down to Fielding's cabin, and made Fielding play  it, native fashion, as he thrummed his own banjo and sang the airy  ballad, \"The Dragoons of Enniskillen.\" Yet Dicky was thinking hard all  the time.    Now there was in Beni Hassan a ghdzeeyeh, a dancing-woman of the  Ghawazee tribe, of whom, in the phrase of the moralists, the less said  the better. What her name was does not matter. She was well-to-do. She  had a husband who played the kemengeh for her dancing. She had as good a  house as the Omdah, and she had two female slaves.    Dicky Donovan was of that rare type of man who has the keenest desire to  know all things, good or evil, though he was fastidious when it came  to doing them. He had a gift of keeping his own commandments. If he  had been a six-footer and riding eighteen stone--if he hadn't been, as  Fielding often said, so \"damned finicky,\" he might easily have come a  cropper. For, being absolutely without fear, he did what he listed and  went where he listed. An insatiable curiosity was his strongest point,  save one. If he had had a headache--though he never had--he would at  once have made an inquiry into the various kinds of headache possible to  mortal man, with pungent deductions from his demonstrations. So it was  that when he first saw a dancing-girl in the streets of Cairo he  could not rest until by circuitous routes he had traced the history of  dancing-girls back through the ages, through Greece and the ruby East,  even to the days when the beautiful bad ones were invited to the feasts  of the mighty, to charm the eyes of King Seti or Queen Hatsu.    He was an authority on the tribe of the Ghawazee, proving, to their  satisfaction and his own, their descent from the household of Haroon al  Rashid. He was, therefore, welcome among them. But he had found also,  as many another wise man has found in \"furrin parts,\" that your greatest  safety lies in bringing tobacco to the men and leaving the women alone.  For, in those distant lands, a man may sell you his nuptial bed, but he  will pin the price of it to your back one day with the point of a lance  or the wedge of a hatchet.    Herebefore will be found the reason why Dicky Donovan--twenty-five and  no moustache, pink-cheeked and rosy-hearted, and \"no white spots on his  liver\"--went straight, that particular night, to the house of the chief  dancing-girl of Beni Hassan for help in his trouble. From her he had  learned to dance the dance of the Ghawazee. He had learned it so that,  with his insatiable curiosity, his archaeological instinct, he should be  able to compare it with the Nautch dance of India, the Hula-Hula of the  Sandwich Islanders, the Siva of the Samoans.    A half-hour from the time he set his foot in Beni Hassan two  dancing-girls issued from the house of the ghdzeeyeh, dressed in  shintiydn and muslin tarah, anklets and bracelets, with gold coins about  the forehead--and one was Dicky Donovan. He had done the rare thing: he  had trusted absolutely that class of woman who is called a \"rag\" in that  far country, and a \"drab\" in ours. But he was a judge of human nature,  and judges of human nature know you are pretty safe to trust a woman  who never trusts, no matter how bad she is, if she has no influence over  you. He used to say that the better you are and the worse she is, the  more you can trust her. Other men may talk, but Dicky Donovan knows.    What Dicky's aunt, the Dowager Lady Carmichael, would have said to have  seen Dicky flaunting it in the clothes of a dancing-girl through the  streets of vile Beni Hassan, must not be considered. None would have  believed that his pink-and-white face and slim hands and staringly white  ankles could have been made to look so boldly handsome, so impeachable.  But henna in itself seems to have certain qualities of viciousness in  its brownish-red stain, and Dicky looked sufficiently abandoned. The  risk was great, however, for his Arabic was too good and he had to  depend upon the ghdzeeyeh's adroitness, on the peculiar advantage of  being under the protection of the mistress of the house as large as the  Omdah's.    From one cafe to another they went. Here a snakecharmer gathered a  meagre crowd about him; there an 'A'l'meh, or singing-girl, lilted a  ribald song; elsewhere hashish-smokers stretched out gaunt, loathsome  fingers towards them; and a Sha'er recited the romance of Aboo Zeyd.  But Dicky noticed that none of the sheikhs, none of the great men of  the village, were at these cafes; only the very young, the useless,  the licentious, or the decrepit. But by flickering fires under the  palm-trees were groups of men talking and gesticulating; and now and  then an Arab galloped through the street, the point of his long lance  shining. Dicky felt a secret, like a troubled wind, stirring through the  place, a movement not explainable by his own inner tremulousness.    At last they went to the largest cafe beside the Mosque of Hoseyn. He  saw the Sheikh-el-beled sitting on his bench, and, grouped round him,  smoking, several sheikhs and the young men of the village. Here he and  the ghdzeeyeh danced. Few noticed them; for which Dicky was thankful;  and he risked discovery by coming nearer the circle. He could,  however, catch little that they said, for they spoke in low tones, the  Sheikh-el-beled talking seldom, but listening closely.    The crowd around the cafe grew. Occasionally an Arab would throw back  his head and cry: \"Allahu Akbar!\" Another drew a sword and waved it  in the air. Some one in front of him whispered one startling word to a  camel-driver.    Dicky had got his cue. To him that whisper was as loud and clear as the  \"La ilaha illa-llah!\" called from the top of a mosque. He understood  Ibrahim the Orderly now; he guessed all--rebellion, anarchy, massacre.  A hundred thoughts ran through his head: what was Ibrahim's particular  part in the swaggering scheme was the first and the last of them.    Ibrahim answered for himself, for at that moment he entered the burning  circle. A movement of applause ran round, then there was sudden silence.  The dancing-girls were bid to stop their dancing, were told to be gone."]]]
