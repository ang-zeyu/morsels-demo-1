This Bible also contains the record of the sealing  of Cornelius P. and Parmelia Lott, parents of Melissa, which was  done by Patriarch Hyrum Smith in the Prophet's presence and with his  \"seal\" or sanction. The president of your church has seen this record,  and it matters not what he may say _now_ he _then_ acknowledged the  genuineness of the record.    The following is also copied from the journal of William Clayton which  is in the Historian's office:        May 1st, (1843) A.M. At the Temple. At 10 married Joseph to Lucy      Walker. P.M. at Prest. Joseph's; he has gone out with Woodsworth.    This is the same William Clayton who wrote the revelation at the  direction and from the dictation of the Prophet July 12, 1843. However,  this principle was first revealed to the Prophet several years before  that time, as you learned in your conversation with President Lorenzo  Snow, when you were in his office.      MORE EVIDENCE CONSIDERED    Right here we will consider the \"evidence\" you produce to show that  \"Joseph Smith and the Church during his lifetime condemned polygamy  in the strongest terms.\" The testimony of the thirty-one witnesses  you \"produce\" was against the \"secret wife system\" of the vile John  C. Bennett who was excommunicated for betraying female virtue. This  Bennett system had nothing to do with the system of celestial marriage  introduced by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and was no more like the  Prophet's doctrine than darkness is like daylight. The certificate  of these parties that you mention was given in October 1842 (T. & S.  3:939), nearly one year before the revelation on celestial marriage  was recorded. At that time the law of marriage in the Church was  that adopted in 1835, and was binding on all who had accepted the  higher law, and they were few in number.[5] The best proof that these  \"witnesses\" did not condemn the celestial marriage doctrine of the  prophet in this communication, is that out of the thirty-one, at least  sixteen have testified that the Prophet introduced that system. One of  this number of witnesses became the Prophet's wife, one performed a  marriage ceremony in which the Prophet was married to a plural wife,  and one other was a witness to such a marriage ceremony. At least six  testify that the Prophet taught them the principle of plural marriage  and the others, so far as I know, are not on record. That these  witnesses were the dupes of Brigham Young cannot truthfully be said,  for three of them left the Church and never followed Brigham Young, yet  they testify of these things.    The action of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, as recorded in the _Times  and Seasons_ (5:3), wherein Hyrum Brown was cut off the Church for  preaching polygamy and other false doctrines, was just and timely. The  same action would have been taken at any other period of the existence  of the Church. Polygamy never was a doctrine of the Church, and the  system introduced by the Prophet Joseph Smith was not called by that  name in his day. Nor was the system of the Prophet the same as that of  Hyrum Brown; and if it had been, the ruling of the Prophet of October  5, 1843, would have cost Brown his standing in the Church, the polygamy  of Brown and John C. Bennett was of their own make. In relation to this  subject, I will quote from the _Life of John Taylor_, pages 223-224:        The polygamy and gross sensuality charged by Bennett and repeated      by those ministers in France, had no resemblance to celestial or      patriarchal marriage which Elder Taylor knew existed at Nauvoo, and      which he had obeyed. Hence in denying the false charges of Bennett,      he did not deny the existence of that system of marriage that God      had revealed; no more than a man would be guilty of denying the      legal, genuine currency of the country by denying the genuineness      and denouncing what he knew to be a mere counterfeit of it.        Another illustration: Jesus took Peter, James and John into the      mountain, and there met with Moses and Elias, and the glory of God      shone about them, and these two angels talked with Jesus, and the      voice of God was heard proclaiming Him to be the Son of God. After      the glorious vision, as Jesus and His companions were descending      the mountain, the former said: \"Tell the vision to no man, until      the Son of Man be risen from the dead.\" Suppose one of these      apostles had turned from the truth before the Son of Man was risen      from the dead and under the influence of wicked, lying spirit,      should charge that Jesus and some of his favorite apostles went up      into a mountain, and there met Moses and Elias,--or some persons      pretending to represent them--together with a group of voluptuos      courtesans, with whom they spent the day in licentious pleasure.      If the other apostles denounced that as an infamous falsehood,      would they be untruthful? No; they would not. Or would they be      under any obligations when denying the falsehoods of the apostate      to break the commandments the Lord had given them by relating      just what had happened in the mountain? No; it would have been a      breach of the Master's strict commandment for them to do that. So      with Elder Taylor. While he was perfectly right and truthful in      denying the infamous charges repeated by his oponents, he was under      no obligation and had no right to announce to the world, at that      time the doctrine of celestial marriage. It was not the law of the      Church, or even the law of the Priesthood of the Church; the body      thereof at the time knew little or nothing of it, though it had      been revealed to the Prophet and made known to some of his most      trusted followers. But today, now that the revelation on celestial      marriage is published to the world, if the slanderous charges      contained in the writings of John C. Bennett should be repeated,      every Elder in the Church could truthfully and consistently do just      what Elder Taylor did in France--he could deny their existence.\"      THAT UTAH VISIT    After receiving your letter, I requested of my father that he give me  a written statement in answer to your charge that he \"discussed\" the  doctrine of \"polygamy\" with you, and received the following:        _Joseph F. Smith, Jr_.        Dear Son:--You have submitted to me some statements made by Mr.      R. C. Evans of the Reorganized church, and desire to know what I      have to say about them. He says: \"If your father denies that he      and I discussed the doctrine of polygamy, all I have to say about      it is, that what he states is untrue.\" Perhaps I could dismiss      this statement precisely in the same way he has. I could certainly      do so far more truthfully. He and I did not discuss the doctrine      of \"polygamy\" at all. It is true I did introduce him to President      Lorenzo Snow, to Aunt Lucy W. Smith, to Aunt Catherine P. Smith, to      Heber J. Grant and a few others. Whatever \"discussion\" he had on      the \"doctrine of polygamy\" may have been with these parties, but      not with me. While in my company he was my guest by introduction      from my cousin Joseph Smith, president of the Reorganized church,      and I carefully avoided any discussion with him upon any and all      differences of opinion which existed between us, the discussion of      which could only have resulted in ill feeling and perhaps extreme      bitterness. I treated him as any gentleman should treat another,      not as an antagonist but as a stranger within my gates, indeed,      as my guest; and when we parted it was with mutual good feelings      and interchange of kindly wishes, without the slightest breath      or suspicion of unpleasantness, which must have existed had we      indulged in a \"discussion of the doctrine of polygamy,\" or any      other points of difference.        Aunt Catherine P. Smith was making us a short visit at the time,      and I introduced her to Mr. Evans as the wife of my father, Hyrum      Smith. They had some conversation, in which I took no part, and      to the best of my recollection he drew out from her the fact that      she was married to Hyrum Smith, by Joseph Smith the Prophet, in      August 1843, in the brick office of Hyrum Smith, at Nauvoo, in the      presence of her mother, Sarah Godshall Phillips, Mrs. Julia Stone      and her daughter Hettie.        Mr. Evans attempted to cross-question her on her statement, but she      stoutly and unequivocally affirmed the truth of what she had said.      Mrs. Lizzie Wilcox, your mother and two or three other members of      the family were present and heard what was said.        With reference to Mr. Evans' alleged interview with Aunt Lucy W.      Smith at the Theatre, I need only say I occupied a seat adjoining      them, and heard the conversation between them, and I have not the      slightest recollection of the statement he has made about that      interview. The strong point which he attempts to make is the fact      that Lucy was married to the Prophet Joseph Smith, on May 1, 1843,      while the revelation on plural marriage was dated \"July 12, 1843,\"      and her consequent embarrassment, was far-fetched; for no one knew      better than she did that the revelation was given as far back as      1834, and was first reduced to writing in 1843. And on one could      have been better prepared to state that fact than Aunt Lucy W.      Smith. There could not be, therefore, any cause for embarrassment      on her part on that score, and I apprehend she would have been one      of the last persons to \"sit silent and confused\" under such an      implied impeachment.        That she bore testimony to the good character of Aunt Emma Smith      with reference to other matters than plural marriage is true;      but not to her conduct toward that principle.

Jesus  was baptized by immersion. He must have gone down into the water, for  when he was baptized he \"went up straightway out of the water\" (Matt.  3:16). When Philip baptized the Eunuch, \"they went down both into the  water.\" John baptized \"in Anon, near to Salim, because there was much  water there,\" a proof presumptive of baptism by immersion, that being  the only mode requiring \"much water\" for its performance.    Paul's Concept.--Paul compared baptism to burial and resurrection:  \"Buried with him [Christ] in baptism,\" wrote he to the Colossians  (2:12), \"wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the  operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.\" Again--this time  to the Romans: \"Know ye not that so many of us as are baptized into  Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore, we are buried  with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from  the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in  newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness  of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection\"  (Rom. 6:3-5).    Note also Paul's words to the Corinthians, already quoted: \"Else what  shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at  all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?\" In other words, why use  the symbol of the resurrection, if there be no resurrection--if the  symbol does not symbolize?    Paul discovered, by symbolical reasoning, or had it revealed to him  more directly, that the children of Israel, \"our fathers,\" were all  baptized in passing through the Red Sea, on their way to Canaan (1 Cor.  1:2): an idea which suggests that the Brother of Jared and his colony  may have been baptized in like manner, for they underwent a similar  experience in passing through ocean deeps on the way to their promised  land (Ether 6:6).    The New Testament Mode.--That immersion was the mode instituted by John  the Baptist and perpetuated by the apostles, is a plain and reasonable  inference from the teachings of the New Testament. But, in addition,  we have the statements of philologists, archeologists, and historians,  who declare that baptism, in the early ages of Christianity, was a  dipping or submersion in water. The English word \"baptize\" comes from  a Greek word meaning to immerse. Monumental remains in Asia, Africa,  and Europe show that immersion was the act of baptism. The many ancient  baptisteries now remaining on those continents were built and used for  the purpose of immersion.    The Mode Changed.--The Christian churches of the Orient--Greek,  Russian, Armenian, Nestorian, Coptic, and others, have always practiced  immersion, and allow nothing else for baptism. The western churches  preserved this form of the ordinance for thirteen centuries, and then  gradually introduced pouring or sprinkling.    Clinic Baptism.--Baptisms of this kind were exceptional in the early  ages of the Christian Church. They were called clinic baptisms, because  administered, as a rule, to the sick, who could not be taken from their  beds to be immersed: but they were rare, and were regarded only as  quasi baptisms. The first recorded case of clinic baptism is mentioned  by Eusebius as having occurred in the third century.    Immersion Made Optional.--Baptism by immersion was practiced regularly  in the Roman Catholic church, until the year 1311, when the Council of  Ravenna authorized a change, leaving it optional with the officiating  minister to baptize either by immersion or by sprinkling. Even infants  were baptized by immersion, until about the end of the thirteenth  century, when sprinkling came into common use.    Luther and Calvin Disagree.--Luther sided with the immersionists, and  sought, against the tendency of the times, to restore immersion; but  Calvin held that the mode of baptism was of no consequence. Even he  admitted, however, that the word \"baptism\" signifies immersion; and he  said: \"It is certain that immersion was the practice of the ancient  Church.\"    Methods in Various Churches.--Pouring is the present practice in the  Roman Catholic church; sprinkling in the Church of England, and in the  Methodist church. A choice of modes is permitted by the Presbyterians,  though sprinkling is the regular form. The Baptists, as their name  implies, are strong advocates of immersion. The Quakers repudiate  baptism altogether.    It was the custom in early ages to immerse the candidate three  times--once for each name in the Godhead; but heretics took advantage  of this practice to argue against the unity of the Trinity, and the  three-fold immersion was abolished.    Authorized Practice.--The practice of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints in baptism is indicated by the following passages  from the Book of Mormon:    \"Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your  words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye  baptize them: behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in  my name ye shall baptize them.    \"And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them  by name, saying,    \"Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name  of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.    \"And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out  of the water.    \"And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name, for behold, verily  I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, are  one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I  are one.    \"And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. And  there shall be no disputations among you, as there hath hitherto been;  neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of  my doctrine, as there hath hitherto been;    \"For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of  contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of  contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger,  one with another.\" (III Nephi 11:23-29.)    Modern Revelation.--The Latter-day Saints derive their knowledge  of baptism not mainly from the Bible, nor from the Book of Mormon,  nor from any other ancient record of God's dealings with man. That  knowledge came directly to Joseph Smith. Through him was restored  that which was lost. He brushed aside the cobwebs and dust concealing  the precious jewel of Truth, and by new revelation brought back the  knowledge of the \"one Lord, one faith, one baptism\" of the ancients.    It was the fifteenth of May, 1829. Joseph Smith, with his scribe,  Oliver Cowdery, at the little town of Harmony, Susquehanna county,  Pennsylvania, was translating the plates of the Book of Mormon. Coming  upon a passage referring to baptism for the remission of sins--a  doctrine well-nigh obsolete in Christendom--they inquired of the Lord  concerning it, retiring into a grove for that purpose. While they were  praying, a messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and  laying his hands upon their heads, spoke these words:    \"Upon you, my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the  Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels,  and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the  remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth,  until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in  righteousness\" (D&C 13).    Restoration of the Priesthood.--The heavenly messenger told the two  young men that he was John the Baptist, and that he acted under the  direction of the Apostles Peter, James and John, who held the keys  of the Melchizedek Priesthood, which should in due time be conferred  upon them. The Aaronic Priesthood gave them authority to baptize with  water, but the Melchizedek Priesthood, which was greater, would give  them authority to baptize with the Holy Ghost. Agreeable to the angel's  direction, Joseph and Oliver immersed each other in water, for the  remission of their sins. Subsequently they received, under the hands  of Peter, James and John, the higher priesthood, and were themselves  ordained apostles and baptized with the Holy Ghost. They in turn  baptized others, and this was the beginning of divinely-authorized  baptismal work in this dispensation.    The Church Law.--The standing law to the Church upon this subject is as  follows:    \"Inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes  which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of  repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism  and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when  eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents;    \"For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her  stakes which are organized;    \"And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins  when eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands.\" (D.&  C.68:25-27.)    The Laying On of Hands.--The laying on of hands is the  divinely-authorized method of administering spirit baptism, in  other words, imparting the Holy Ghost. It is plainly taught in the  Scriptures. For instance:    \"Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.\"    \"And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostle's hands the  Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,    \"Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he  may receive the Holy Ghost.\" (Acts 8:17-19.)    The laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost was an ordinance  in the Christian church for centuries. The ordinance remained with the  church much longer than did the Holy Ghost. Cyprian mentions it in the  third century; Augustine in the fourth. Gradually, however, it began  to be neglected,"]]]
