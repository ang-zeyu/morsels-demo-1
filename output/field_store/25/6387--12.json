In the same way it is the  purchasing power of the workers in these factories in the cities  that enables them and their wives and children to eat more beef,  more pork, more wheat, more corn, more fruit and more dairy  products, and to buy more clothing made from cotton, wool and  leather.  In a physical and a property sense, as well as in a  spiritual sense, we are members one of another.    I want to make it clear that no simple panacea can be applied to  the drought problem in the whole of the drought area.  Plans must  depend on local conditions, for these vary with annual rainfall,  soil characteristics, altitude and topography.  Water and soil  conservation methods may differ in one county from those in an  adjoining county.  Work to be done in the cattle and sheep country  differs in type from work in the wheat country or work in the corn  belt.    The Great Plains Drought Area Committee has given me its  preliminary recommendations for a long-time program for that  region.  Using that report as a basis we are cooperating  successfully and in entire accord with the governors and state  planning boards.  As we get this program into operation the people  more and more will be able to maintain themselves securely on the  land.  That will mean a steady decline in the relief burdens which  the federal government and states have had to assume in time of  drought; but, more important, it will mean a greater contribution  to general national prosperity by these regions which have been hit  by drought.  It will conserve and improve not only property values,  but human values.  The people in the drought area do not want to be  dependent on federal, state or any other kind of charity.  They want  for themselves and their families an opportunity to share fairly by  their own efforts in the progress of America.    The farmers of America want a sound national agricultural policy in  which a permanent land-use program will have an important place.  They want assurance against another year like 1932 when they made  good crops but had to sell them for prices that meant ruin just as  surely as did the drought.  Sound policy must maintain farm prices  in good crop years as well as in bad crop years.  It must function  when we have drought; it must also function when we have bumper  crops.    The maintenance of a fair equilibrium between farm prices and the  prices of industrial products is an aim which we must keep ever  before us, just as we must give constant thought to the sufficiency  of the food supply of the nation even in bad years.  Our modern  civilization can and should devise a more successful means by which  the excess supplies of bumper years can be conserved for use in  lean years.    On my trip I have been deeply impressed with the general efficiency  of those agencies of the federal, state and local governments which  have moved in on the immediate task created by the drought.  In 1934  none of us had preparation; we worked without blueprints and made  the mistakes of inexperience.  Hindsight shows us this.  But as time  has gone on we have been making fewer and fewer mistakes.  Remember  that the federal and state governments have done only broad  planning.  Actual work on a given project originates in the local  community.  Local needs are listed from local information.  Local  projects are decided on only after obtaining the recommendations  and help of those in the local community who are best able to give  it.  And it is worthy of note that on my entire trip, though I asked  the question dozens of times, I heard no complaint against the  character of a single work relief project.    The elected heads of the states concerned, together with their  state officials and their experts from agricultural colleges and  state planning boards, have shown cooperation with and approval of  the work which the federal government has headed.  I am grateful  also to the men and women in all these states who have accepted  leadership in the work in their locality.    In the drought area people are not afraid to use new methods to  meet changes in Nature, and to correct mistakes of the past.  If  overgrazing has injured range lands, they are willing to reduce the  grazing.  If certain wheat lands should be returned to pasture they  are willing to cooperate.  If trees should be planted as windbreaks  or to stop erosion they will work with us.  If terracing or summer  fallowing or crop rotation is called for, they will carry them out.  They stand ready to fit, and not to fight, the ways of Nature.    We are helping, and shall continue to help the farmer to do those  things, through local soil conservation committees and other  cooperative local, state and federal agencies of government.    I have not the time tonight to deal with other and more  comprehensive agricultural policies.    With this fine help we are tiding over the present emergency.  We  are going to conserve soil, conserve water and conserve life.  We  are going to have long-time defenses against both low prices and  drought.  We are going to have a farm policy that will serve the  national welfare.  That is our hope for the future.    There are two reasons why I want to end by talking about  reemployment.  Tomorrow is Labor Day.  The brave spirit with which so  many millions of working people are winning their way out of  depression deserves respect and admiration.  It is like the courage  of the farmers in the drought areas.    That is my first reason.  The second is that healthy employment  conditions stand equally with healthy agricultural conditions as a  buttress of national prosperity.  Dependable employment at fair  wages is just as important to the people in the towns and cities as  good farm income is to agriculture.  Our people must have the  ability to buy the goods they manufacture and the crops they  produce.  Thus city wages and farm buying power are the two strong  legs that carry the nation forward.    Reemployment in industry is proceeding rapidly.  Government spending  was in large part responsible for keeping industry going and  putting it in a position to make this reemployment possible.  Government orders were the backlog of heavy industry; government  wages turned over and over again to make consumer purchasing power  and to sustain every merchant in the community.  Businessmen with  their businesses, small and large, had to be saved.  Private  enterprise is necessary to any nation which seeks to maintain the  democratic form of government.  In their case, just as certainly as  in the case of drought-stricken farmers, government spending has  saved.    Government having spent wisely to save it, private industry begins  to take workers off the rolls of the government relief program.  Until this administration we had no free employment service, except  in a few states and cities.  Because there was no unified employment  service, the worker, forced to move as industry moved, often  travelled over the country, wandering after jobs which seemed  always to travel just a little faster than he did.  He was often  victimized by fraudulent practices of employment clearing houses,  and the facts of employment opportunities were at the disposal  neither of himself nor of the employer.    In 1933 the United States Employment Service was created--a  cooperative state and federal enterprise, through which the federal  government matches dollar for dollar the funds provided by the  states for registering the occupations and skills of workers and  for actually finding jobs for these registered workers in private  industry.  The federal-state cooperation has been splendid.  Already  employment services are operating in thirty-two states, and the  areas not covered by them are served by the federal government.    We have developed a nationwide service with seven hundred district  offices and one thousand branch offices, thus providing facilities  through which labor can learn of jobs available and employers can  find workers.    Last spring I expressed the hope that employers would realize their  deep responsibility to take men off the relief rolls and give them  jobs in private enterprise.  Subsequently I was told by many  employers that they were not satisfied with the information  available concerning the skill and experience of the workers on the  relief rolls.  On August 25th I allocated a relatively small sum to  the employment service for the purpose of getting better and more  recent information in regard to those now actively at work on  W.P.A.  Projects--information as to their skills and previous  occupations--and to keep the records of such men and women up-to-  date for maximum service in making them available to industry.  Tonight I am announcing the allocation of two and a half million  dollars more to enable the Employment Service to make an even more  intensive search then it has yet been equipped to make, to find  opportunities in private employment for workers registered with it.    Tonight I urge the workers to cooperate with and take full  advantage of this intensification of the work of the Employment  Service.  This does not mean that there will be any lessening of our  efforts under our W.P.A. and P.W.A. and other work relief programs  until all workers have decent jobs in private employment at decent  wages.  We do not surrender our responsibility to the unemployed.  We  have had ample proof that it is the will of the American people  that those who represent them in national, state and local  government should continue as long as necessary to discharge that  responsibility.  But it does mean that the government wants to use  resource to get private work for those now employed on government  work, and thus to curtail to a minimum the government expenditures  for direct employment.    Tonight I ask employers, large and small, throughout the nation, to  use the help of"]]]
