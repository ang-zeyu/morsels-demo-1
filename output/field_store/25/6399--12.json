The  books to which the term is ascribed are in popular speech not merely  apocryphal, but the Apocrypha.\"    6. _Attitude of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the  Apocrypha:_ See Doctrine and Covenants, sec. xci.    7. _Definition of the Term Canon:_ \"The word Canon in classical Greek  signifies properly a straight rod, as a carpenter's rule; and hence  is applied metaphorically to a testing rule in ethics or in art, or  in language (e. g. the canons of Grammar.) As applied to Scripture,  the word indicates the rule by which the contents of the Bible must be  determined, and thus, secondarily, an index of the constituent books.  The canon of Scripture may be generally described as \"the collection of  books which forms the original and authoritative written rule of the  faith and practice of the Church.\" (Dr. Smith's Old Testament History,  p. 645.)    8. _Arrangement of the Canon Ascribed to Ezra:_ \"Among the achievements  ascribed to Ezra is the collection, editing, and arrangement of the  whole Jewish Scriptures in one canon, under the threefold division of  the Law, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa. In performing this work, he  is assumed to have added those passages which can not have been written  by the authors whose names the books bear; such as the allusion to  kings of Israel in Gen. xxxvi: 31; the account of the death and burial  of Moses in the last chapter of Deuteronomy; and the many references  to the state of 'things at this day.' * * * * * But the main question  is, whether the present canon of the Old Testament was, in substance,  the work of Ezra. It must be remembered that such a work involved much  more than the collection into one volume of books already existing in a  separate form; it included the selection from the whole number of those  which bore, and were to bear forever, the stamp of divine authority:  for no one imagines that the Scriptures of the Old Testament form a  complete collection of the ancient Hebrew literature. That such a work,  having such authority, had been completed before the Christian era, is  clear from the allusions to the Holy Scriptures in the New Testament;  and it was most probably accomplished during the Persian domination,  which ended B. C. 323. There is every reason for its having been  performed at as early a period as possible. Ezra's care to make the  people well acquainted with the word of God is as conspicuous as his  own knowledge of it. No man could be more qualified, as no time could  be more fit, for a work which was most needful to establish the people  in their faith. That the work must have been performed by an inspired  man, is an axiom lying at the foundation of the whole question, unless  we believe, on the one hand, that the Church is endowed in every age  with power to decide what Scriptures are canonical, or unless, on the  other hand, we give up a canon, in the proper sense of the word, and  reduce the authority of Scripture to that which literary criticism can  establish for its separate books. On this ground, none but Ezra can be  the author of the canon; for no one has ever thought of ascribing the  work to Nehemiah, the civil governor and man of action; and the only  claim made for Malachi is the addition of his own prophecy to the canon  already framed by Ezra, and even this supposition we have seen to be  unnecessary, as Ezra may have been the survivor. The attempt to ascribe  the work to some unknown inspired person later than Malachi is an  example of the _argumentum ab ignorantia_, which has no weight against  the evidence of what is known.\" (Dr. Smith's Old Testament History, pp.  645-646.)    9. _The Authorized Version:_ The treatise on the Authorized Version  in Smith's Bible Dictionary is full, and perhaps the best one extant;  and while praising highly the work of the English translators of the  A. V., exhibits quite clearly some of its defects, and points out the  necessity for a new version. How far the \"Revised Version\" of 1870-1885  corrected the defects of the A. V. may be known only to Hebrew and  Greek scholars; but the fact that the work was undertaken and carried  to a conclusion at the expense of so much time, and scholarly effort,  justifies the qualified acceptance of our English Bible set forth in  one of our Articles of Faith, viz., \"We believe the Bible to be the  word of God, as far as it is translated correctly.\"    Footnotes    1. It has already been suggested in our Introduction to these lessons  that excuses for non-preparation should not be tolerated; and we again  call attention of the quorums to this necessary attitude respecting  thorough preparation of lessons; and now emphasize our suggestions by  applying them to these lectures. Those who are assigned to deliver the  lectures can receive their appointment two or three weeks before they  are called upon to deliver them, and it should be a matter of pride  with those so appointed to come to their tasks thoroughly prepared.  The lecturer is supposed to occupy about thirty minutes, and the  assignments should be made with due regard to the difficulties of the  subject.    2. No better mental exercise exists than that of writing. It leads to  very definite thinking, and to exactness of expression, and is an art  that should be cultivated by the Seventies. It is suggested, therefore,  that at least one of the lectures, when the quorum session is devoted  to such exercises, should be given in the form of a paper, a written  treatise. The subject for the paper will be indicated as above.    3. Smith's Bible Dictionary.        LESSON III.    _THE PENTATEUCH._      ANALYSIS.

In  the time of Ezra and Nehemiah it was called \"the Law of Moses,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6052"],[0,"The Minds and Manners of Wild Animals: A Book of Personal Observations (#13)"],[1,"instincts of the vertebrates. They are the bedrock  foundations upon which every species rests. As they are stable or  unstable, good or bad, so lives or dies the individual, and the  species also.    In employing the term \"highest animals\" I wish to be understood as  referring to the warm-blooded vertebrates, and not merely the apes  and monkeys that both structurally and mentally are nearest to  man.    Throughout my lifetime I have been by turns amazed, entertained  and instructed by the marvelous intelligence and mechanical skill  of small mammals in constructing burrows, and of certain birds in  the construction of their nests. Today the hanging nest of the  Baltimore oriole is to me an even greater wonder than it was when  I first saw one over sixty years ago. Even today the mechanical  skill involved in its construction is beyond my comprehension. My  dull brain can not figure out the processes by which the bird  begins to weave its hanging purse at the tip end of the most  unstable of all earthly building sites,--a down-hanging elm-tree  branch that is swayed to and fro by every passing breeze. The  situation is so \"impossible\" that thus far no moving picture  artist has ever caught and recorded the process.    Take in your hand a standard oriole nest, and examine it  thoroughly. First you will note that it is very strong, and  thoroughly durable. It can stand the lashings of the fiercest  gales that visit our storm-beaten shore.    How long would it take a man to unravel that nest, wisp by wisp,  and resolve it into a loose pile of materials? Certainly not less  than an entire day. Do you think that even your skilful fingers,--  unassisted by needles,--could in two days, or in three, weave of  those same materials a nest like that, that would function as did  the original? I doubt it. The materials consist of long strips of  the thin inner bark of trees, short strings, and tiny grass stems  that are long, pliable and tough. Who taught the oriole how to  find and to weave those rare and hard-to-find materials? And how  did it manage all that weaving with its beak only? Let the wise  ones answer, if they can; for I confess that I can not!    Down in Venezuela, in the delta of the Orinoco River, and  elsewhere, lives a black and yellow bird called the giant cacique  (pronounced cay-seek'), which as a nest-builder far surpasses our  oriole. Often the cacique's hanging nest is from four to six feet  long. The oriole builds to escape the red squirrels, but the  cacique has to reckon with the prehensile-tailed monkeys.    Sometimes a dozen caciques will hang their nests in close  proximity to a wasps' nest, as if for additional protection. A  cacique's nest hangs like a grass rope, with a commodious purse at  its lower end, entered by a narrow perpendicular slit a foot or so  above the terminal facilities. It is impossible to achieve one of  these nests without either shooting off the limb to which it  hangs, or felling the tree. If it hangs low enough a charge of  coarse shot usually will cut the limb, but if high, cutting it down  with a rifle bullet is a more serious matter.    [Illustration with caption: HANGING NEST OF THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE  (From the \"American Natural History\")]    [Illustration with caption: GREAT HANGING NESTS OF THE CRESTED  CACIQUE As seen in the delta of the Orinoco Rover, Venezuela.]    To our Zoological Park visitors the African weaver birds are a  wonder and a delight. Orioles and caciques do not build nests in  captivity, but the weavers blithely transfer their activities to  their spacious cage in our tropical-bird house. The bird-men keep  them supplied with raffia grass, and they do the rest. Fortunately  for us, they weave nests for fun, and work at it all the year  round! Millions of visitors have watched them doing it. To  facilitate their work the upper half of their cage is judiciously  supplied with tree-branches of the proper size and architectural  slant. The weaving covers many horizontal branches. Sometimes a  group of nests will be tied together in a structure four feet  long; and it branches up, or down, or across, seemingly without  rhyme or reason.    Some of the weavers, which inhabit Africa, Malayana and Australia,  are \"communal\" nest-builders. They build colonies of nests, close  together. Imagine twenty-five or more Baltimore orioles massing  their nests together on one side of a single tree, in a genuine  village. That is the habit of some of the weaver birds;--and this  brings us to what is called the most wonderful of all  manifestations of house-building intelligence among birds. It is  the community house of the little sociable weaver-bird of South  Africa (_Philetoerus socius_). Having missed seeing the work  of this species save in museums, I will quote from the Royal  Natural History, written by the late Dr. Richard Lydekker, an  excellent description: --This species congregates in large flocks,  many pairs incubating their eggs under the same roof, which is  composed of cartloads of grass piled on a branch of some camel-  thorn tree in one enormous mass of an irregular umbrella shape,  looking like a miniature haystack and almost solid, but with the  under surface (which is nearly flat) honeycombed all over with  little cavities, which serve not only as places for incubation,  but also as a refuge against rain and wind.    \"They are constantly being repaired by their active little  inhabitants. It is curious that even the initiated eye is  constantly being deceived by these dome-topped structures, since  at a distance they closely resemble native huts. The nesting-  chambers themselves are warmly lined with feathers.\"    Here must we abruptly end our exhibits of the intelligence of a  few humble little birds as fairly representative of the wonderful  mental ability and mechanical skill so common in the ranks of the  birds of the world. It would be quite easy to write a volume on  The Architectural Skill of Birds!    Now, let us look for a moment into the house-building intelligence  and skill of some of the lower tribes of men. Out of the multitude  of exhibits available I will limit myself to three, widely  separated. In the first place, the habitations of the savage and  barbaric tribes are usually the direct result of their own mental  and moral deficiencies. The Eskimo is an exception, because his  home and its location are dictated by the hard and fierce  circumstances which dictate to him what he must do. Often he is  compelled to move as his food supply moves. The Cliff-Dweller  Indian of the arid regions of the Southwest was forced to cliff-  dwell, in order to stave off extermination by his enemies. Under  that spur he became a wonderful architect and engineer.    For present purposes we are concerned with three savage tribes  which might have been rich and prosperous agriculturists or  herdsmen had they developed sufficient intelligence to see the  wisdom of regular industry.    Consider first the lowest of three primitive tribes that inhabit  the extreme southern point of Patagonia, whose real estate  holdings front on the Strait of Magellan. That region is treeless,  rocky, windswept, cold and inhospitable. I can not imagine a place  better fitted for an anarchist penal colony. North of it lie  plains less rigorous, and by degrees less sterile, and finally  there are lands quite habitable by cattle-and-crop-growing men.    But those three tribes elect to stick to the worst spot in South  America. The most primitive is the tribe of \"canoe Indians\" of  Tierra del Fuego, which probably represents the lowest rung of the  human ladder. Beside them the cave men of 30,000 years ago were  kings and princes. Their only rivals seem to be the Poonans of  Central Borneo, who, living in a hot country, make no houses or  shelters of any kind, and have no clothing but a long strip of  bark cloth around the loins.    The Fuegians have long been known to mariners and travellers. They  inhabit a region that half the year is bleak, cold and raw, but  they make nothing save the rudest of the rude in canoes--of rough  slabs tied together and caulked _with moss,_--and rough bone-  pointed spears, bows, arrows and paddles. Their only clothing  consists of skins of the guanacos loosely hung from the neck, and  flapping over the naked and repulsive body. They make no houses,  and on shore their only shelters from the wind and snow and  chilling rains are rabbit-like forms of brush, broken off by hand.    These people are lower in the scale of intelligence than any wild  animal species known to me; for they are mentally too dull and low  to maintain themselves on a continuing basis. Their hundred years  of contact with man has taught them little; and numerically they  are decreasing so rapidly that the world will soon see the  absolute finish of the tribe.    In the best of the three tribes, the Tchuelclus, the birth rate is  so low that within recent times the tribe has diminished from  about 5,000 to a remnant of about 500.    Now, have those primitive creatures \"immortal souls?\" Are they  entitled to call chimpanzees, elephants, bears and dogs \"lower  animals?\" Do they \"think,\" or \"reason,\" any more than the animals  I have named?    It is a far cry from the highest to the lowest of the human race;  and we hold that the highest animals intellectually are higher  than the lowest men.    Now go with me for a moment to the lofty and dense tropical forest  in the heart of the Territory of Selangor, in the Malay Peninsula.  That forest is the home of the wild elephant, rhinoceros and  sladang. And there dwells a jungle tribe called the Jackoons, some  members of which I met at their family home, and observed  literally in their own ancestral tree. Their house was not wholly  bad, but it might have been 100 per cent better. It was merely a  platform of small poles, placed like a glorified bird's nest in  the spreading forks of a many-branched tree, about"]]]
