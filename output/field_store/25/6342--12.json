One might hide from a man, not from a dog. Dave  had, for the instant, forgotten the dog. Springing forward, he all but  fell over some large, dark object. Bending over, he picked the thing up.  \"Some instrument, perhaps a--\"    His thoughts broke off. The dog had found the fugitive. There came a  muttered guttural curse, a sound of a solid impact, the howl of the dog,  and after that scurrying footsteps.    At that instant the instrument in Dave's hand gave forth a flood of  light. The light fell full upon the fleeting figure of a man. The man  turned half about. Having caught the fellow's profile in bold relief,  Dave recognized him instantly. And then the fugitive, with the dog at  his heels, plunged down the narrow, winding stairs.    Dave was fast, but not fast enough. Once, as he raced down those stairs,  he caught a glimpse of man and dog. Then he tripped over a broken step,  plunged downward, hit his head against the wall, was out for thirty  seconds, and so lost the race.    He arrived at the castle door just in time to see two fleeting shadows,  a man and a dog, lose themselves in the deeper shadow of a small, low  stone structure fifty yards or more from the castle.    As he stood balanced on the threshold he suddenly became conscious of a  tremendous roar overhead. It seemed that one of those tri-motored  bombers must crash against the castle's tower. And then?    In sudden terror he fairly tumbled down two flights of stairs, banged  against the massive iron-bound door to the dungeon, tumbled through and  slammed the door behind him, just as a terrific blast set the castle  shuddering from towers to dungeon.    In the moments that followed they could hear the dull thud of masonry  falling. But it all seemed very far away, like part of a bad dream.    There came a second crash, a third. Then all was silent and the ghosts  that perhaps haunted this dungeon, spirits of those who suffered here in  solitary confinement centuries ago, might, Dave supposed, walk in peace.    It was Alice who broke that silence. Her voice was as calm and restful  as it would have been were she seated before the fire in her own  kitchen. She was speaking to the two waifs from London's slums. They  were curled up beside her on an ancient stone bench.    \"Yes, children,\" was her answer to a whispered question, \"Louise and  Charlotte, the two lady spies, lived and worked as spies for a long  time. They performed many daring feats.    \"You know,\" she went on, and they were all listening now, \"Louise and  Charlotte always had messages to carry across the line. In places there  was a river to cross. Always there was the terrible wall of barbed wire  and traps. Louise, who could not swim and dared not trust a boat, went  across the river many times on a large chopping bowl.\"    \"Funny little boat,\" Peggy whispered.    \"They used strange devices for hiding their messages.\" Alice had a good  memory. \"Once when Louise was arrested she threw a black ball of yarn  into the brush at the side of the road but held to the end until it had  landed. The message was wound inside the ball of yarn.\"    \"They didn't find it. That was good!\" Tillie whispered. \"Go on! What  else?\"    \"Once the two girl spies seemed to be going on a picnic. They were  munching bread and sausages as they marched along. Once more they were  searched. Nothing was found. The message was in Louise's sausage.    \"Oh yes,\" Alice drew a heavy sigh. \"Those two girls did marvelous things  for their country. They set up a secret radio and sent over messages.  They trained carrier pigeons to take messages across the line. Daring  Frenchmen were carried over the line in airplanes to spy out the enemy's  defenses. Louise helped them.    \"And after that,\" the story teller sighed more deeply, \"there came  darker days. The enemy counter-spies wove a web of evidence about them.  They were arrested. Evidence was produced. They were court-martialed.  The sentence was: 'For Louise, death. For Charlotte, death.'\"    \"And--and were they really shot?\" Peggy whispered with a shudder.    \"Not yet.\" Alice's voice was low. \"Their prison keeper had come to  respect and love them as if they were his children.    \"'Poor souls', he said, 'So they have condemned you to die? Ask what you  will. It shall be granted.'    \"When the day for their execution was near,\" Alice went on, \"they  requested that they might spend their last night on earth together.    \"The keeper carried this request to the governor. He returned with a  radiant face. 'He has refused it,' he whispered to Louise. Thank God! It  means that they will not shoot you in the morning. Otherwise he would  not have denied you.\"    \"Oh, good!\" Peggy breathed.    \"That morning,\" Alice went on after a time, \"another beautiful girl,  Gabrielle Petiti, was to be shot as a spy. Louise and Charlotte heard  her walking to the place of her execution and they heard her cry:  'Salut! O mon dernier matin!' (Salute, O my last morning!)\"    \"Oh!\" Peggy whispered.    \"And were--\" Tillie began.    \"No, Louise and Charlotte were not shot.\" There was a catch in Alice's  voice. \"Because of their loyalty and great bravery they were sent to  prison for life.    \"Two months and two days before the great war ended Louise died in  prison. Charlotte lived on and went back to keeping shop. Perhaps she's  living still.\"    \"And now perhaps she's a spy again.\" Peggy shuddered with ecstasy. \"I'm  going to be a spy some day.\"    \"Alice, my dear,\" said Lady Applegate, \"that's no story to tell to a  child.\"    But Tillie whispered very low, \"I--I think it is wonderful, Alice.  I--I'd like to kiss you.\" And she did.    Just then there came a scratching at the door. \"It's Flash!\" Cherry  cried. \"We've all forgotten him.\"    As she threw the door open the dog went creeping across the floor to  curl up, still whining low, at Alice's feet.                                        _Chapter_ XV                             Until the Very End      For sometime the dog lay quietly at Alice's feet. At last, once more at  ease, he rose, stretched himself, walked twice across the dungeon floor,  then, marching up to Dave whined low.    \"What's this?\" Dave demanded. \"You want to go out again? Haven't you had  enough for one night?\"    In answer the dog walked to the door, then whined again.    \"O. K.,\" said Dave \"I don't hear any motors. Perhaps the big show is  over. Let's get going.\"    \"I'll go with you,\" Brand said quietly.    Arrived at the outer castle door, Dave took one look, then let out a low  whistle. \"Old boy,\" he said in a hoarse voice, looking down at the dog,  \"how did you escape?\"    \"What do you mean, escape?\" Brand asked.    \"Look!\" Dave pointed to a dark spot in the brightly lighted meadow. \"See  that black hole? What stood there two hours ago?\"    \"Say!\" Brand stared. \"A stone building stood there.\"    \"But then,\" he added after a thought, \"what does it matter? It was just  an empty old out building.\"    \"I'm not so sure it was empty,\" Dave replied soberly. \"Last time I  looked at that building a man and a dog were going through the door.  That was less than two minutes before the first blast. There,\" his was a  dramatic gesture, \"question is, where's the man? If he is at all any  more.\"    \"Stop talking in riddles,\" Brand's voice rose. \"This has been a bad  night.\"    \"Sit down and I'll tell you,\" Dave invited as he dropped to a place on  the well-worn door sill.    The story of his visit to the top of the tower both astonished and  thrilled his companion.    \"And the fellow who went into that shack,\" Dave added with a flourish of  his arm, \"was none other than the assistant to old John, the shoemaker.  What's more, his real name is Nicholas Schlitz.\"    \"No!\" Brand sprang to his feet. \"It can't be!\"    \"It is!\" Dave insisted. \"Remember that picture you took from the wrecked  plane? The picture of two young fellows?\"    \"Yes, I remember.\"    \"They were clear enough. You couldn't make a mistake if you saw one of  those men. I saw Nicholas tonight, by the bright light of his own signal  torch. I couldn't be mistaken. In the shoe shop he was always bending  over, half hiding his face. Tonight I really _saw_ him.\"    \"Where's his signal torch?\" Brand asked suddenly.    \"That's right,\" Dave sprang up. \"Where is it? In my excitement I might  have--    \"Yes. Here it is.\" He drank in a deep breath of relief. \"I must have put  it down. I--I was afraid he had come back for it.\"    \"He never will,\" said Brand.    \"You can't be sure,\" Dave replied thoughtfully. \"Flash went in with him.  If Flash escaped, how about Nicholas Schlitz, the spy? After all, there  were three blasts. There was some time between the first and last. Who's  going to say whether the first or last made that hole out there?\"    To this question Brand found no answer.    Brand stood up, gazed at the sky, north, south, east and west, listened  for a full minute, then said: \"Storm's over. Let's see if we can't get  them all to go home.\"    It took little persuading to get Alice and Cherry started. Soon they  were all on their way.    It was only as they rounded the last curve that brought them in full  view of their home that the full significance of Heinie's work that  night burst upon them.    They greeted the scene that lay before them in tragic silence. The home  that had housed the Ramsey tribe for a dozen generations was a wreck. A  bomb had landed on the east end and torn it completely away. Gone was  the prim little parlor with its very formal furniture, gone the cozy  dining room with its array of ancient willow-ware and rare glass-ware.  Gone was the big four-poster bed on which Cherry and Alice had slept  since they were tiny tots, and gone all the countless treasures that had  adorned their rooms.    \"Le--t--, let's have a look.\" Brand climbed out of the car. He was  trying to be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#13)"],[1," openly kept the sea, attacking  the Christian merchant ships, but when cruising alone they hid in  unfrequented bays, or behind uninhabited islets, until they could pounce  upon a passing ship whose size promised an easy capture. The Order of  St. John furnished a maritime police, earning thereby the deep gratitude  of Spain, France, and Italy. They were aided occasionally by the  Venetians, but these, being frequently engaged in quarrels with their  neighbours, did but a small share of this work, only sending their  fleets to sea when danger threatened some of their possessions in the  Levant.    \"This is delightful, Ralph,\" Gervaise said, as they stood together on  the poop, looking back at the receding city.    \"What a pleasant change it is from standing in the broiling sun watching  those poor wretches toiling at the fortifications! There is only one  drawback to my pleasure. I wish that we carried sails, and were moved  along by the breeze, instead of by the exertions of the slaves.\"    \"Much chance we should have of catching a pirate under such  circumstances!\" Ralph said, laughing. \"You might as well set a tortoise  to catch a hare.\"    \"I don't say that we should not be obliged to carry rowers, Ralph; but  all the prizes that have been brought in since I have been at Rhodes  carry masts and sails, as well as oars, and, as I understand, for the  most part cruise about under sail, and only use the oars when chasing or  fleeing.\"    \"That is so; because, you see, in most cases the crew themselves have  to row, and I have no doubt if we had no slaves to do the work we should  soon take to masts and sails also; but for speed the rowing galleys are  the best, for unless a brisk wind were blowing, the mast and sails would  but check her progress when the oars were out, and at any rate constrain  her to travel only before the wind. I know your weakness about the  slaves, Gervaise; but as we could neither build our fortifications  nor row our galleys without them, I cannot go as far as you do in the  matter, though I own that I am sometimes sorry for them. But you must  remember that it is the fault of their people, and not of ours, that  they are here.\"    \"All that is true enough, Ralph, and I cannot gainsay you. Still I would  rather that we were gliding along with sails instead of being rowed by  slaves.\"    \"At any rate, Gervaise, you will not see them ill treated, for I myself  heard Ricord, just before we were starting, tell the slave overseers  that so long as the rowers did fair work they were not to use their  whips, and that only if we were in chase of a pirate were they to be  urged to their utmost exertions.\"    \"I am right glad to hear it, Ralph, and shall be able to enjoy the  voyage all the more, now you have told me that such orders have been  issued.\"    For a fortnight they cruised about among the islands. Several times  boats rowed out from the shore to the galley with complaints of outrages  by pirates under a notorious corsair named Hassan Ali, who had landed,  burnt villages, killed many of the inhabitants, and carried off the rest  as slaves; but no one could give any clue to aid them in their search  for the corsairs. The time passed very pleasantly. There was no occasion  for speed; often they lay all day in some bay, where they could approach  near enough to the shore to lie in the shade of trees, while two or  three of the knights ascended a hill and kept watch there for the  appearance of any vessels of a suspicious character. One morning, after  passing the night at anchor, Harcourt and Gervaise were despatched just  before sunrise to take a look round before the galley got under way.  From the top of the hill they had an uninterrupted view of the sea,  studded with islands on all sides of them. Beyond a few fishing boats,  looking like black specks on the glassy surface, no craft were in sight.  They were about to return to the galley when, taking a last look round,  Gervaise suddenly exclaimed, \"Look, Ralph! There is smoke ascending from  that island to the southwest. There was none just now.\"    \"You mean from that bay, Gervaise? Yes, I see it; it is not more than a  light mist.\"    \"It is growing thicker,\" Gervaise said, \"and spreading. Maybe it is but  a hut that has accidentally caught fire, but it seems to me that the  smoke is rising from several points.\"    \"I think you are right, Gervaise. Let us hurry down with the news. It  may be that it is a village which has been attacked by pirates who have  landed on the other side of the island during the night, for I can see  no ships in the bay.\"    A few minutes' run and they stood on the shore.    \"Quick, men!\" Ralph said to the rowers of the boat that had brought them  ashore. \"Row your hardest.\"    The slaves bent to their oars, and they were soon alongside the galley,  which lay two or three hundred yards from the shore. Those on board had  noticed the young knights running down the hill, and, marking the speed  at which the boat was rowing, concluded at once that they must have  observed one of the pirate's ships.    \"Do you see anything of them, Sir Ralph?\" the commander shouted, as they  came close.    \"We have seen no ships, Sir Louis, but there is smoke coming up from a  bay in an island four or five miles away to the southwest. It seems to  us that it is far too extensive a fire to be the result of an accident,  for there was no smoke until within two or three minutes of the time we  left, and before we started it was rising from several points, and we  both think that it must come from a village that has been attacked by  pirates.\"    The commander rapidly issued his orders, and in two or three minutes the  anchor was weighed, the boat hoisted on deck, and the oars in motion.    \"Stretch to your oars!\" Ricord shouted to the slaves. \"Hitherto we have  exacted no toil from you, but you have to work now, and woe be to him  who does not put out his full strength.\"    Grateful for the unusual leniency with which they had been treated,  the slaves bent to their oars, and the galley sped rapidly through the  water. On rounding the end of the island there was an exclamation of  satisfaction from the knights as they saw wreaths of white smoke rising  from the distant island.    \"There can be no doubt that it is a village in flames,\" Sir Louis said;  \"and from the suddenness with which it broke out, it is clear that it  must have been fired at several points. You say you saw no craft near?\"  he asked, turning to Harcourt.    \"There were none there, or from the top of the hill we should assuredly  have made them out, Sir Louis.\"    \"Then the pirates--if this be, as I hope, their work--must have landed  at some other point on the island, and if they catch sight of us they  may make for their ship and slip away, unobserved by us. Instead of  rowing direct, therefore, we will make for that islet to the right, and  row round behind it. There are two others almost adjoining it. Once past  these, 'tis not more than half a mile to that island stretching away  south. Once round that, we shall be beyond the one from which we see the  smoke rising, and can come down on its southern side. The course will  be double the distance that it would be if we took a straight line, but  except when we cross from island to island we shall not be exposed to  their view, and may fall upon their ships before the crews have returned  from their work of plunder.\"    The knights fully agreed, and orders were given to the helmsman  accordingly.    \"We must not over fatigue the rowers,\" the commander said. \"We may have  a long chase if they have started before we get round.\"    He therefore gave orders to the slaves that, while they were to exert  themselves to the utmost when crossing the open sea, they were to relax  their efforts and to row within their strength while coasting along  behind the islands. On board, everything was made in readiness for a  fight: the knights buckled on their armour, the cooks set cauldrons of  pitch over the fire, the cannoneers loaded her eight guns. It was an  hour and a half after their start before they rounded the end of the  last island. It extended a little farther to the south than did that to  which they were making, and as they rounded the point, eager looks were  cast in search of the pirate ships. No craft were, however, to be seen.    \"They must be in some bay or inlet,\" the commander said; \"they can  hardly have left, for it would have taken them half an hour at least to  cross the island with their booty and captives, and even if they made  straight away after having fired the village, their ship could have gone  no great distance, for we must have seen her if she put to sea--unless  indeed they were anchored on the east of the island, and have sailed in  that direction.\"    \"Keep them rowing along steadily,\" he said to the overseers of the  slaves; \"but do not press them too hard. We may have a chase yet, and  need all their strength, for most of these pirates are fast craft, and  if they should get a start of three or four miles, it will be a long row  before we catch them.\"    They made straight for the island, and on nearing it coasted along its  southern side. It was some three miles long, the shore being for the  most part steep, but here and there falling gradually to the water's  edge. Two or three little clusters of houses could be seen as they rowed  along; one of these was on fire.    \"That is good,\" Sir Louis exclaimed, as, on turning a point, they saw  the flames. \"That cannot have been lighted long, and we are pretty  certain to come upon the vessels before the marauders have set sail.\"    Several inlets and small bays were passed, but all were empty. A few  fishing boats lay on the shore, but there were no signs of life, as no  doubt the people would, long since, have taken alarm and sought shelter  in the woods. There was a sharp point just before they reached the  southeastern extremity of"]]]
