Shall I be        Despised by the basest,        To the lawless a spur,        A scoff to the free?    My husband cannot desire me,    A goddess, to suffer such shame!    WOTAN [_Gloomily._          What then wouldst thou?    FRICKA          Shield not the Wälsung.    WOTAN [_In a muffled voice._          His way let him go.    FRICKA      Thou wilt grant him no aid,    When to arms the avenger calls?    WOTAN          I shield him no more.    FRICKA          Seek not to trick me;        Look in my eyes!    The Valkyrie turn from him too.    WOTAN          The Valkyrie free shall choose.    FRICKA          Not so; she but acts        To accomplish thy will;    Give order that Siegmund die.    WOTAN [_After a violent internal struggle._          Nay, slay him I cannot,        He found my sword!    FRICKA          Remove thou the magic,        And shatter the blade:    Swordless let him be found.    BRÜNNHILDE [_Is heard calling from the heights._          Heiaha! Heiaha!        Hojotoho!        Heiaha! Heiaha!    Heiohotojo! Hotojoha!    FRICKA      Thy valorous maiden comes;    Shouting, hither she rides.    WOTAN      For Siegmund I called her to horse.            [_Brünnhilde appears with her horse on the rocky          path to the right. When she sees Fricka she stops          abruptly and, during the following, slowly and          silently leads her horse down the path. She then          puts it in a cave._    FRICKA          By her shield to-day        Be guarded the honour    Of thy eternal spouse!        Derided by men,        Shorn of our power,    Perish and pass would the Gods        If thy valiant maid        Avenged not to-day    My sacred and sovereign right.    The Wälsung falls for my honour.    Does Wotan now pledge me his oath?    WOTAN [_Throwing himself on to a rocky seat in terrible dejection._          Take the oath!            [_Fricka strides towards the back, where she meets          Brünnhilde and halts for a moment before her._    FRICKA          Warfather        Waits for thee;        He will instruct thee    How the lot is decreed!            [_She drives off quickly._    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Comes forward anxious and wondering to Wotan,          who leaning back on his rocky seat, is brooding          gloomily._          Ill closed        The fight, I fear;    Fricka laughs at the outcome!        Father, what news        Hast thou to tell me?    Sad thou seemest and troubled!    WOTAN [_Dropping his arm helplessly and sinking his head on his breast._          By self-forged fetters        I am bound,    I, least free of all living!    BRÜNNHILDE          I know thee not thus:        What gnaws at thy heart?    WOTAN            [_His expression and gestures working up, from this          point, to a fearful outburst._          O sacrilege vile!        O grievous affront!        Gods' despair!        Gods' despair!        Infinite wrath!        Woe without end!    Most sorrowful I of all living!    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Alarmed, throws her shield, spear and helmet from          her and kneels with anxious affection at his feet._          Father! Father!        Tell me what ails thee?    With dismay thou art filling thy child!        Confide in me        For I am true;    See, Brünnhilde begs it!            [_She lays her head and hands with tender anxiety          on his knees and breast._    WOTAN            [_Looks long in her eyes, then strokes her hair          with involuntary tenderness. As if coming out of a          deep reverie, he at last begins, very softly._          What if, when uttered,        Weaker it made    The controlling might of my will?    BRÜNNHILDE [_Very softly._      To Wotan's will thou speakest    When thou speakest to me?        What am I        If I am not thy will?    [Illustration: Plate 25, Brünnhilde slowly and silently leads her horse down the  path to the cave.]    WOTAN [_Very softly._      What never to any was spoken    Shall be unspoken now and for ever.        Myself I speak to,        Speaking to thee.            [_In a low, muffled voice._          When young love grew        A waning delight,    'Twas power my spirit craved;        By rash and wild        Desires driven on,    I won myself the world.        Unknown to me        Dishonest my acts were;        Bargains I made        Wherein hid mishap,    Craftily lured on by Loge,    Who straightway disappeared.        Yet I could not leave        Love altogether;    When grown mighty still I desired it.        The child of night,        The craven Nibelung,    Alberich, broke from its bond.        All love he forswore,        And procured by the curse    The gleaming gold of the Rhine,    And with it measureless might.        The ring that he wrought        I stole by my cunning,        But I restored it not        To the Rhine;        It paid the price        Of Walhall's towers:    The home the giants had built me,    From which I commanded the world.        She who knows all        That ever was,        Erda, the holy,        All-knowing Wala,    Warned me touching the ring:    Prophesied doom everlasting.        Of this doom I was fain        To hear further,    But silent she vanished from sight.    Then my gladness of heart was gone,    The god's one desire was to know.        To the womb of the earth        Downward then I went:        By love's sweet magic        Vanquished the Wala,    Troubled her wisdom proud,    And compelled her tongue to speak.    Tidings by her I was told;    And with her I left a fair pledge:    The world's wisest of women    Bore me, Brünnhilde, thee.        With eight sisters        Fostered wert thou,        That ye Valkyries        Might avert the doom        Which the Wala's        Dread words foretold:    The gods' ignominious ending.        That foes might find us        Strong for the strife,    Heroes I got ye to gather.        The beings who served us        As slaves aforetime,        The men whose courage        Aforetime we curbed:        Who through treacherous bonds        And devious dealings        Were bound to the gods        In blindfold obedience--        To kindle these men        To strife was your duty,        To drive them on        To savage war,    That hosts of dauntless heroes    Might gather in Walhall's hall.    BRÜNNHILDE      And well filled surely thy halls were;    Many a one I have brought.        We never were idle,        So why shouldst thou fear?    [Illustration: Plate 26          \"Father! Father!         Tell me what ails thee?    With dismay thou art filling thy child!\"]    WOTAN [_His voice muffled again._          Another ill--        Mark what I say--    Was by the Wala foretold!        Through Alberich's hosts        Doom may befall us;        A furious grudge        Alberich bears me;        But now that my heroes        Make victory certain    I defy the hosts of the night.        Only if he won        The ring again from me,    Walhall were forfeit for ever.        Used by him alone        Who love forswore        Could the runes of the ring        Bring doom        To the mighty gods,        And shame without end.        My heroes' valour        He would pervert,        Would stir to strife        The bold ones themselves,        And with their strength        Wage war upon me.    So, alarmed, I resolved    To wrest the ring from the foeman.            [_In a low voice._          I once paid Fafner,        One of the giants,        With gold accurst        For work achieved.    Fafner guards now the hoard    For which his own brother he slew.    The ring I must needs recover    With which his work I rewarded.        But I cannot strike one        By treaties protected;        Vanquished by him        My valour would fail.        These are the bonds        That bind my power;    I, who by treaties am lord,    To my treaties also am slave.        But what I dare not        One man may dare--        A hero never        Helped by my favour,        To me unknown        And granted no grace,        Unaware,        Bidden by none,        Constrained thereto        By his own distress--        He could achieve        What I must not do:    The deed I never urged,    Though it was all my desire.        But, alas! how to find        One to fight me, the god,        For my good--        Most friendly of foes!        How fashion the free one        By me unshielded,        In his proud defiance        Most precious to me?        How get me the other        Who, not through me,        But of himself        Will perform my will?        O woe of the gods!        Horrible shame!        Soul-sick am I        Of seeing myself    In all I ever created.    The other whom I so long for,    That other I never find.    The free by themselves must be fashioned,    All that I fashion are slaves!    BRÜNNHILDE          But the Wälsung, Siegmund,        Works for himself.    WOTAN          Wild I roamed        In the woodland with him,        Ever against the gods        Goading him to rebel.            [_Slowly and bitterly._      Now, when the gods seek vengeance,    Shield he has none but the sword        Given to him        By the grace of a god.        Why did I try        To trick myself vainly?        How easily Fricka        Found out the fraud!        She read my inmost        Heart to my shame.    I must bend my will to her wishes.    BRÜNNHILDE      Of victory wouldst Siegmund deprive?    WOTAN      I have handled Alberich's ring,    Loth to let the gold go.        The curse that I fled        Is following me:    I must always lose what I love most,    Slay what my heart holds dearest,        Basely betray        All those who trust.            [_His gestures, at first those of terrible grief          end by expressing despair._          Pale then and pass        Glory and pomp,        Godhead's resplendent,        Glittering shame!        In ruins fall        The fabric I built!    Ended is my work;    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/485"],[0,"The Road to Oz (#13)"],[1,"that has any color at all.\"    \"But I thought this was the Land of Oz,\" replied the shaggy man, as if  greatly disappointed.    \"So it is,\" she declared; \"but there are four parts to the Land of Oz.  The North Country is purple, and it's the Country of the Gillikins.  The East Country is blue, and that's the Country of the Munchkins.  Down at the South is the red Country of the Quadlings, and here, in the  West, the yellow Country of the Winkies.  This is the part that is  ruled by the Tin Woodman, you know.\"    \"Who's he?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"Why, he's the tin man I told you about.  His name is Nick Chopper, and  he has a lovely heart given him by the wonderful Wizard.\"    \"Where does HE live?\" asked the boy.    \"The Wizard?  Oh, he lives in the Emerald City, which is just in the  middle of Oz, where the corners of the four countries meet.\"    \"Oh,\" said Button-Bright, puzzled by this explanation.    \"We must be some distance from the Emerald City,\" remarked the shaggy  man.    \"That's true,\" she replied; \"so we'd better start on and see if we can  find any of the Winkies.  They're nice people,\" she continued, as the  little party began walking toward the group of trees, \"and I came here  once with my friends the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman, and the  Cowardly Lion, to fight a wicked witch who had made all the Winkies her  slaves.\"    \"Did you conquer her?\" asked Polly.    \"Why, I melted her with a bucket of water, and that was the end of  her,\" replied Dorothy.  \"After that the people were free, you know, and  they made Nick Chopper--that's the Tin Woodman--their Emp'ror.\"    \"What's that?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"Emp'ror?  Oh, it's something like an alderman, I guess.\"    \"Oh,\" said the boy.    \"But I thought Princess Ozma ruled Oz,\" said the shaggy man.    \"So she does; she rules the Emerald City and all the four countries of  Oz; but each country has another little ruler, not so big as Ozma.  It's like the officers of an army, you see; the little rulers are all  captains, and Ozma's the general.\"    By this time they had reached the trees, which stood in a perfect  circle and just far enough apart so that their thick branches  touched--or \"shook hands,\" as Button-Bright remarked.  Under the shade  of the trees they found, in the center of the circle, a crystal pool,  its water as still as glass.  It must have been deep, too, for when  Polychrome bent over it she gave a little sigh of pleasure.    \"Why, it's a mirror!\" she cried; for she could see all her pretty face  and fluffy, rainbow-tinted gown reflected in the pool, as natural as  life.    Dorothy bent over, too, and began to arrange her hair, blown by the  desert wind into straggling tangles.  Button-Bright leaned over the  edge next, and then began to cry, for the sight of his fox head  frightened the poor little fellow.    \"I guess I won't look,\" remarked the shaggy man, sadly, for he didn't  like his donkey head, either.  While Polly and Dorothy tried to comfort  Button-Bright, the shaggy man sat down near the edge of the pool, where  his image could not be reflected, and stared at the water thoughtfully.  As he did this he noticed a silver plate fastened to a rock just under  the surface of the water, and on the silver plate was engraved these  words:      THE TRUTH POND      \"Ah!\" cried the shaggy man, springing to his feet with eager joy;  \"we've found it at last.\"    \"Found what?\" asked Dorothy, running to him.    \"The Truth Pond.  Now, at last, I may get rid of this frightful head;  for we were told, you remember, that only the Truth Pond could restore  to me my proper face.\"    \"Me, too!\" shouted Button-Bright, trotting up to them.    \"Of course,\" said Dorothy.  \"It will cure you both of your bad heads, I  guess.  Isn't it lucky we found it?\"    \"It is, indeed,\" replied the shaggy man.  \"I hated dreadfully to go to  Princess Ozma looking like this; and she's to have a birthday  celebration, too.\"    Just then a splash startled them, for Button-Bright, in his anxiety to  see the pool that would \"cure\" him, had stepped too near the edge and  tumbled heels over head into the water.  Down he went, out of sight  entirely, so that only his sailor hat floated on the top of the Truth  Pond.    He soon bobbed up, and the shaggy man seized him by his sailor collar  and dragged him to the shore, dripping and gasping for breath.  They  all looked upon the boy wonderingly, for the fox head with its sharp  nose and pointed ears was gone, and in its place appeared the chubby  round face and blue eyes and pretty curls that had belonged to  Button-Bright before King Dox of Foxville transformed him.    \"Oh, what a darling!\" cried Polly, and would have hugged the little one  had he not been so wet.    Their joyful exclamations made the child rub the water out of his eyes  and look at his friends questioningly.    \"You're all right now, dear,\" said Dorothy.  \"Come and look at  yourself.\" She led him to the pool, and although there were still a few  ripples on the surface of the water he could see his reflection plainly.    \"It's me!\" he said, in a pleased yet awed whisper.    \"'Course it is,\" replied the girl, \"and we're all as glad as you are,  Button-Bright.\"    \"Well,\" announced the shaggy man, \"it's my turn next.\"  He took off his  shaggy coat and laid it on the grass and dived head first into the  Truth Pond.    When he came up the donkey head had disappeared, and the shaggy man's  own shaggy head was in its place, with the water dripping in little  streams from his shaggy whiskers.  He scrambled ashore and shook  himself to get off some of the wet, and then leaned over the pool to  look admiringly at his reflected face.    \"I may not be strictly beautiful, even now,\" he said to his companions,  who watched him with smiling faces; \"but I'm so much handsomer than any  donkey that I feel as proud as I can be.\"    \"You're all right, Shaggy Man,\" declared Dorothy.  \"And Button-Bright  is all right, too.  So let's thank the Truth Pond for being so nice,  and start on our journey to the Emerald City.\"    \"I hate to leave it,\" murmured the shaggy man, with a sigh.  \"A truth  pond wouldn't be a bad thing to carry around with us.\"  But he put on  his coat and started with the others in search of some one to direct  them on their way.          14.  Tik-Tok and Billina      They had not walked far across the flower-strewn meadows when they came  upon a fine road leading toward the northwest and winding gracefully  among the pretty yellow hills.    \"That way,\" said Dorothy, \"must be the direction of the Emerald City.  We'd better follow the road until we meet some one or come to a house.\"    The sun soon dried Button-Bright's sailor suit and the shaggy man's  shaggy clothes, and so pleased were they at regaining their own heads  that they did not mind at all the brief discomfort of getting wet.    \"It's good to be able to whistle again,\" remarked the shaggy man, \"for  those donkey lips were so thick I could not whistle a note with them.\"  He warbled a tune as merrily as any bird.    \"You'll look more natural at the birthday celebration, too,\" said  Dorothy, happy in seeing her friends so happy.    Polychrome was dancing ahead in her usual sprightly manner, whirling  gaily along the smooth, level road, until she passed from sight around  the curve of one of the mounds.  Suddenly they heard her exclaim \"Oh!\"  and she appeared again, running toward them at full speed.    \"What's the matter, Polly?\" asked Dorothy, perplexed.    There was no need for the Rainbow's Daughter to answer, for turning the  bend in the road there came advancing slowly toward them a funny round  man made of burnished copper, gleaming brightly in the sun.  Perched on  the copper man's shoulder sat a yellow hen, with fluffy feathers and a  pearl necklace around her throat.    \"Oh, Tik-tok!\" cried Dorothy, running forward.  When she came to him,  the copper man lifted the little girl in his copper arms and kissed her  cheek with his copper lips.    \"Oh, Billina!\" cried Dorothy, in a glad voice, and the yellow hen flew  to her arms, to be hugged and petted by turns.    The others were curiously crowding around the group, and the girl said  to them:    \"It's Tik-tok and Billina; and oh! I'm so glad to see them again.\"    \"Wel-come to Oz,\" said the copper man in a monotonous voice.    Dorothy sat right down in the road, the yellow hen in her arms, and  began to stroke Billina's back.  Said the hen:    \"Dorothy, dear, I've got some wonderful news to tell you.\"    \"Tell it quick, Billina!\" said the girl.    Just then Toto, who had been growling to himself in a cross way, gave a  sharp bark and flew at the yellow hen, who ruffled her feathers and let  out such an angry screech that Dorothy was startled.    \"Stop, Toto! Stop that this minute!\" she commanded.  \"Can't you see  that Billina is my friend?\"  In spite of this warning had she not  grabbed Toto quickly by the neck the little dog would have done the  yellow hen a mischief, and even now he struggled madly to escape  Dorothy's grasp.  She slapped his ears once or twice and told him to  behave, and the yellow hen flew to Tik-tok's shoulder again, where she  was safe.    \"What a brute!\" croaked Billina, glaring down at the little dog.    \"Toto isn't a brute,\" replied Dorothy, \"but at home Uncle Henry has to  whip him sometimes for chasing the chickens.  Now look here, Toto,\" she  added, holding up her finger and speaking sternly to him, \"you've got  to understand that Billina is one of my dearest friends, and musn't be  hurt--now or ever.\"    Toto wagged his tail as if he understood.    \"The miserable thing can't talk,\" said Billina, with a sneer.    \"Yes, he can,\" replied Dorothy; \"he talks with his tail, and I know  everything he says.  If you could wag your tail, Billina, you wouldn't  need words to talk with.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said Billina.    \"It isn't nonsense at all.  Just now Toto says he's sorry, and that  he'll try to love you for"]]]
