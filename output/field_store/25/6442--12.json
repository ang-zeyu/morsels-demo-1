There are days when I play my second from the fairway of the next  hole but one, days when I couldn't putt into a coal-hole with  'Welcome!' written over it. And you are a Ladies' Open Champion. Still,  if you think it's all right----. Oh, Mary, you little know how I have  dreamed of some day marrying a really first-class golfer! Yes, that was  my vision--of walking up the aisle with some sweet plus two girl on my  arm. You shivered again. You are catching cold.\"    \"It is a little cold,\" said the girl. She spoke in a small voice.    \"Let me take you in, sweetheart,\" said Mortimer. \"I'll just put you in  a comfortable chair with a nice cup of coffee, and then I think I  really must come out again and tramp about and think how perfectly  splendid everything is.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They were married a few weeks later, very quietly, in the little  village church of Saint Brule. The secretary of the local golf-club  acted as best man for Mortimer, and a girl from the hotel was the only  bridesmaid. The whole business was rather a disappointment to Mortimer,  who had planned out a somewhat florid ceremony at St. George's, Hanover  Square, with the Vicar of Tooting (a scratch player excellent at short  approach shots) officiating, and \"The Voice That Breathed O'er St.  Andrews\" boomed from the organ. He had even had the idea of copying the  military wedding and escorting his bride out of the church under an  arch of crossed cleeks. But she would have none of this pomp. She  insisted on a quiet wedding, and for the honeymoon trip preferred a  tour through Italy. Mortimer, who had wanted to go to Scotland to visit  the birthplace of James Braid, yielded amiably, for he loved her  dearly. But he did not think much of Italy. In Rome, the great  monuments of the past left him cold. Of the Temple of Vespasian, all he  thought was that it would be a devil of a place to be bunkered behind.  The Colosseum aroused a faint spark of interest in him, as he  speculated whether Abe Mitchell would use a full brassey to carry it.  In Florence, the view over the Tuscan Hills from the Torre Rosa,  Fiesole, over which his bride waxed enthusiastic, seemed to him merely  a nasty bit of rough which would take a deal of getting out of.    And so, in the fullness of time, they came home to Mortimer's cosy  little house adjoining the links.           *       *       *       *       *    Mortimer was so busy polishing his ninety-four clubs on the evening of  their arrival that he failed to notice that his wife was preoccupied. A  less busy man would have perceived at a glance that she was distinctly  nervous. She started at sudden noises, and once, when he tried the  newest of his mashie-niblicks and broke one of the drawing-room  windows, she screamed sharply. In short her manner was strange, and, if  Edgar Allen Poe had put her into \"The Fall Of the House of Usher\", she  would have fitted it like the paper on the wall. She had the air of one  waiting tensely for the approach of some imminent doom. Mortimer,  humming gaily to himself as he sand-papered the blade of his  twenty-second putter, observed none of this. He was thinking of the  morrow's play.    \"Your wrist's quite well again now, darling, isn't it?\" he said.    \"Yes. Yes, quite well.\"    \"Fine!\" said Mortimer. \"We'll breakfast early--say at half-past  seven--and then we'll be able to get in a couple of rounds before  lunch. A couple more in the afternoon will about see us through. One  doesn't want to over-golf oneself the first day.\" He swung the putter  joyfully. \"How had we better play do you think? We might start with you  giving me a half.\"    She did not speak. She was very pale. She clutched the arm of her chair  tightly till the knuckles showed white under the skin.    To anybody but Mortimer her nervousness would have been even more  obvious on the following morning, as they reached the first tee. Her  eyes were dull and heavy, and she started when a grasshopper chirruped.  But Mortimer was too occupied with thinking how jolly it was having the  course to themselves to notice anything.    He scooped some sand out of the box, and took a ball out of her bag.  His wedding present to her had been a brand-new golf-bag, six dozen  balls, and a full set of the most expensive clubs, all born in  Scotland.    \"Do you like a high tee?\" he asked.    \"Oh, no,\" she replied, coming with a start out of her thoughts.  \"Doctors say it's indigestible.\"    Mortimer laughed merrily.    \"Deuced good!\" he chuckled. \"Is that your own or did you read it in a  comic paper? There you are!\" He placed the ball on a little hill of  sand, and got up. \"Now let's see some of that championship form of  yours!\"    She burst into tears.    \"My darling!\"    Mortimer ran to her and put his arms round her. She tried weakly to  push him away.    \"My angel! What is it?\"    She sobbed brokenly. Then, with an effort, she spoke.    \"Mortimer, I have deceived you!\"    \"Deceived me?\"    \"I have never played golf in my life! I don't even know how to hold the  caddie!\"    Mortimer's heart stood still. This sounded like the gibberings of an  unbalanced mind, and no man likes his wife to begin gibbering  immediately after the honeymoon.    \"My precious! You are not yourself!\"    \"I am! That's the whole trouble! I'm myself and not the girl you  thought I was!\"    Mortimer stared at her, puzzled. He was thinking that it was a little  difficult and that, to work it out properly, he would need a pencil and  a bit of paper.    \"My name is not Mary!\"    \"But you said it was.\"    \"I didn't. You asked if you could call me Mary, and I said you might,  because I loved you too much to deny your smallest whim. I was going on  to say that it wasn't my name, but you interrupted me.\"    \"Not Mary!\" The horrid truth was coming home to Mortimer. \"You were not  Mary Somerset?\"    \"Mary is my cousin. My name is Mabel.\"    \"But you said you had sprained your wrist playing in the championship.\"    \"So I had. The mallet slipped in my hand.\"    \"The mallet!\" Mortimer clutched at his forehead. \"You didn't say 'the  mallet'?\"    \"Yes, Mortimer! The mallet!\"    A faint blush of shame mantled her cheek, and into her blue eyes there  came a look of pain, but she faced him bravely.    \"I am the Ladies' Open Croquet Champion!\" she whispered.    Mortimer Sturgis cried aloud, a cry that was like the shriek of some  wounded animal.    \"Croquet!\" He gulped, and stared at her with unseeing eyes. He was no  prude, but he had those decent prejudices of which no self-respecting  man can wholly rid himself, however broad-minded he may try to be.  \"Croquet!\"    There was a long silence. The light breeze sang in the pines above  them. The grasshoppers chirrupped at their feet.    She began to speak again in a low, monotonous voice.    \"I blame myself! I should have told you before, while there was yet  time for you to withdraw. I should have confessed this to you that  night on the terrace in the moonlight. But you swept me off my feet,  and I was in your arms before I realized what you would think of me. It  was only then that I understood what my supposed skill at golf meant to  you, and then it was too late. I loved you too much to let you go! I  could not bear the thought of you recoiling from me. Oh, I was  mad--mad! I knew that I could not keep up the deception for ever, that  you must find me out in time. But I had a wild hope that by then we  should be so close to one another that you might find it in your heart  to forgive. But I was wrong. I see it now. There are some things that  no man can forgive. Some things,\" she repeated, dully, \"which no man  can forgive.\"    She turned away. Mortimer awoke from his trance.    \"Stop!\" he cried. \"Don't go!\"    \"I must go.\"    \"I want to talk this over.\"    She shook her head sadly and started to walk slowly across the sunlit  grass. Mortimer watched her, his brain in a whirl of chaotic thoughts.  She disappeared through the trees.    Mortimer sat down on the tee-box, and buried his face in his hands. For  a time he could think of nothing but the cruel blow he had received.  This was the end of those rainbow visions of himself and her going  through life side by side, she lovingly criticizing his stance and his  back-swing, he learning wisdom from her. A croquet-player! He was  married to a woman who hit coloured balls through hoops. Mortimer  Sturgis writhed in torment. A strong man's agony.    The mood passed. How long it had lasted, he did not know. But suddenly,  as he sat there, he became once more aware of the glow of the sunshine  and the singing of the birds. It was as if a shadow had lifted. Hope  and optimism crept into his heart.    He loved her. He loved her still. She was part of him, and nothing that  she could do had power to alter that. She had deceived him, yes. But  why had she deceived him? Because she loved him so much that she could  not bear to lose him. Dash it all, it was a bit of a compliment.    And, after all, poor girl, was it her fault? Was it not rather the  fault of her upbringing? Probably she had been taught to play croquet  when a mere child, hardly able to distinguish right from wrong. No  steps had been taken to eradicate the virus from her system, and the  thing had become chronic. Could she be blamed? Was she not more to be  pitied than censured?    Mortimer rose to his feet, his heart swelling with generous  forgiveness. The black horror had passed from him. The future seemed  once more bright. It was not too late. She was still young, many years  younger than he himself had been when he took up golf, and surely, if  she put herself into the hands of a good specialist and practised every  day, she might still hope to become a fair player. He reached the house  and ran in, calling her name.    No answer came. He sped from room to room, but all were empty.    She had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7037"],[0,"Beric the Briton : a Story of the Roman Invasion (#13)"],[1,"as those of the Roman soldiers,  and there were many who thought that Beric, like Cogidinus, a chief  of the Regi of Sussex, had joined himself heart and soul to Rome,  and was preparing his tribe to fight side by side with the legions.  On the other hand many, knowing that Parta had lost her husband at  the hands of the Romans, and hated them with all her heart, held  that she would never have divided her power with Beric, or suffered  him to take military command of the tribe, had she not been assured  of his fidelity to the cause of Britain.    Beric was dressed in the full panoply of a chief. He wore a short  skirt or kilt reaching to his knees. Above it a loose vest or  shirt, girt in by a gold belt, while over his shoulders he wore  the British mantle, white in colour and worked with gold. Around  his neck was the torque, the emblem of chieftainship. On his left  arm he carried a small shield of beaten brass, and from a baldric  covered with gold plates hung the straight pointless British sword  that had been carried by his father in battle. Even those most  suspicious of him could not deny that he was a stalwart and well  built youth, with a full share of pith and muscle, and that his  residence among the Romans had not given him any airs of effeminacy.  The only subject of criticism was that his hair was shorter than  that of his countrymen, for although he had permitted it to grow  since he left Camalodunum, where he had worn it short, in Roman  fashion, it had not yet attained its full length.    Beric felt a stranger among the others. Since his return home there  had been no great tribal gathering, for Prasutagus had for some  time been ill, and had always discouraged such assemblages both  because they were viewed with jealousy by the Romans and because he  begrudged the expenses of entertaining. Parta, who was personally  known to almost all present, introduced Beric to them.    \"My son is none the less one of the Iceni for his Roman training,\"  she said; \"he has learned much, but has forgotten nothing. He is  young, but you will find him a worthy companion in arms when the  day of battle comes.\"    \"I am glad to hear what you say, Parta,\" Aska, one of the older  chiefs, said. \"It would be unfair to impute blame to him for what  assuredly was not his fault, but I feared that they might have  taught him to despise his countrymen.\"    \"It is not so, sir,\" Beric said firmly. \"Happily I fell into good  hands. Caius Muro, the commander of the 12th Legion, in whose charge  I was, is a just as well as a valiant man, and had me instructed  as if I had been his own son, and I trust that I am none the less  a true Briton because I except him and his from the hatred I bear  the Romans. He never said a word to me against my countrymen, and  indeed often bewailed that we were not treated more wisely and  gently, and were not taught to regard the Romans as friends and  teachers rather than oppressors.\"    \"Well spoken, young chief!\" the other said; \"ingratitude is, of  all sins, the most odious, and you do well to speak up boldly for  those who were kind to you. Among all men there are good and evil,  and we may well believe, even among the Romans, there are some who  are just and honourable. But I hear that you admire them greatly,  and that you have been telling to your tribe tales of their greatness  in war and of their virtues.\"    \"I have done so,\" Beric replied. \"A race could not conquer the  world as the Romans have done unless they had many virtues; but  those that I chiefly told of are the virtues that every Briton  should lay to heart. I spoke of their patriotism, of the love of  country that never failed, of the stern determination that enabled  them to pass through the gravest dangers without flinching, and to  show a dauntless face to the foe even when dangers were thickest  and the country was menaced with destruction. Above all, how in  Rome, though there might be parties and divisions, there were none  in the face of a common enemy. Then all acted as one man; there  was no rivalry save in great deeds. Each was ready to give life  and all he possessed in defence of his country. These were lessons  which I thought it well that every Briton should learn and take to  heart. Rome has conquered us so far because she has been one while  we are rent into tribes having no common union; content to sit with  our arms folded while our neighbours are crushed, not seeing that  our turn will come next. It was so when they first came in the time  of our forefathers, it has been so in these latter times; tribe  after tribe has been subdued; while, had we been all united, the  Romans would never have obtained a footing on our shore. No wonder  the gods have turned away their faces from a people so blind and  so divided when all was at stake. Yes, I have learned much from  the Romans. I have not learned to love them, but I have learned to  admire them and to regret that in many respects my own countrymen  did not resemble them.\"    There was a murmur of surprise among the chiefs who had by this  time gathered round, while angry exclamations broke from some of  the younger men; but Aska waved his hand.    \"Beric speaks wisely and truly,\" he said; \"our dissensions have  been our ruin. Still more, perhaps, the conduct of those who should  have led us, but who have made terms with Rome in order to secure  their own possessions. Among these Prasutagus was conspicuous, and  we ourselves were as much to blame as he was that we suffered it.  If he knows what is passing here he himself will see how great are  the misfortunes that he has brought upon his queen, his daughters,  and the tribe. Had we joined our whole forces with those of Caractacus  the Brigantes too might have risen. It took all the strength of  the Romans to conquer Caractacus alone. What could they have done  had the Brigantes and we from the north, and the whole of the  southern tribes, then unbroken, closed down upon them? It is but  yesterday since Prasutagus was buried. The grass has not yet begun  to shoot upon his funeral mound and yet his estates have been seized  by the Romans, while his wife and daughters have been insulted  beyond measure.    \"The young chief of the Sarci has profited by his sojourn among  the Romans. The Druids have told me that the priest who has visited  the Sarci prophesies great things of him, and for that reason  decided that, young as he was, he should share his mother's power  and take his place as leader of the tribe in battle, and that  he foresaw that, should time be given him to ripen his wisdom and  establish his authority, he might some day become a British champion  as powerful as Cunobeline, as valiant as Caractacus. These were  the words of one of the wisest of the Druids. They have been passed  round among the Druids, and even now throughout Britain there are  many who never so much as heard of the name of the Sarci, who yet  believe that, in this young chief of that tribe, will some day be  found a mighty champion of his country. Prasutagus knew this also,  for as soon as Beric returned from Camalodunum he begged the Druids  to find out whether good or evil was to be looked for from this  youth, who had been brought up among the Romans, and their report  to him tallied with that which I myself heard from them. It was for  that reason that Boadicea sent for him with his mother, although  so much younger than any here, and belonging to a tribe that is  but a small one among the Iceni. I asked these questions of him,  knowing that among some of you there were doubts whether his stay  with the Romans had not rendered him less a Briton. He answered as  I expected from him, boldly and fearlessly, and, as you have heard  wisely, and I for one believe in the predictions of the Druids.  But here comes the queen.\"    As he spoke a number of chariots issued from the path through the  forest into the circular clearing, in the centre of which stood  the majestic oak, and at the same moment, from the opposite side,  appeared a procession of white robed Druids singing a loud chant.  As the chariots drew up, the queen and her two daughters alighted  from them, with a number of chiefs of importance from the branches  of the tribe near her capital. Beric had never seen her before,  and was struck with her aspect. She was a tall and stately woman,  large in her proportions, with her yellow hair falling below her  waist. She wore no ornaments or insignia of her high rank; her dress  and those of her daughters were careless and disordered, indicative  of mourning and grief, but the expression of her face was that of  indignation and passion rather than of humiliation.    Upon alighting she acknowledged the greeting of the assembled chiefs  with a slight gesture, and then remained standing with her eyes  fixed upon the advancing Druids. When these reached the sacred tree  they encircled it seven times, still continuing their chanting, and  then ranged themselves up under its branches with the chief Druid  standing in front. They had already been consulted privately by  the queen and had declared for war; but it was necessary that the  decision should be pronounced solemnly beneath the shade of the  sacred oak.    \"Why come you here, woman?\" the chief priest asked, addressing the  queen.    \"I come as a supplicant to the gods,\" she said; \"as an outraged  queen, a dishonoured woman, and a broken hearted mother, and in each  of these capacities I call upon my country's gods for vengeance.\"  Then in passionate words she poured out the story of the indignities  that she and her daughters had suffered, and suddenly loosening  her garment, and suffering it to drop to her waist, she turned  and showed the marks of the Roman rods across her back, the sight  eliciting a shout of fury from the chiefs around her.    \"Let all retire to the woods,\" the Druids said, \"and see that no  eye profanes our mysteries. When the gods have answered"]]]
