The slimy seaweed  underneath caused her to slip, and the strong swirl of the tide nearly  swept her from her feet. With difficulty she splashed back again.    \"We might swim it!\" she suggested. \"But what about our clothes?\"    Mavis shook her head.    \"We can't cross there till the tide goes down.\"    \"Are we going to be drowned?\" asked Romola, in a tremulous little voice.    \"Certainly not!\"--Mavis sounded quite calm and sensible--\"we're safe  enough here, but we're in a jolly nasty fix. We can sit above high-water  mark, but it means staying till the tide goes down and that won't be for  hours, and then it will be dark and how can we see to scramble up the  cliffs?\"    \"I suppose we've got to wait till morning!\" groaned Fay. \"This is  _some_ adventure at any rate!\"    \"Rather more than most of us bargained for!\" agreed Beata.    \"I wouldn't care a nickel, only Mother'll be in such a state of mind when  I don't turn up!\"    \"And Uncle David will be waiting to go home in the car. I wonder what  he'll do?\"    \"They'll have the fright of their lives!\"    \"And we shall have the colds of ours!\" shivered poor Romola. \"October  isn't exactly the month you'd choose for camping out. I wish we'd brought  some more biscuits with us. I'm hungry!\"    \"Don't talk of biscuits or eating! I'm just ravenous.\"    Five very disconsolate girls found a sheltered corner under the cliff and  squatted down to watch the sunset. There was a glorious effect of gold  and orange and great purple clouds tipped with crimson, but they were  none of them quite in the mood to appreciate the beauties of nature, and  would much have preferred the sight of a tea-table. It was beginning to  grow very cold. They buttoned their sports coats about their throats, and  huddled close together for warmth. The sun sank into the sea like a great  fiery ball, and the darkness crept on. Presently the moon rose, shining  over the sea in a broad spreading pathway of silver, that looked like a  gleaming fairy track across the water to the far horizon, where a distant  lighthouse glinted at intervals like a fiery eye. The waiting seemed  interminable. Romola, who felt the cold most, had a little private weep.    \"I've always been crazy on stories of shipwrecks and desert islands,\"  said Fay, \"but when you go through it yourself somehow it seems to take  the edge off the romance. I don't want any more to be a Robinson Crusoe  girl! I'd rather stay warm with pussie by the fire.\"    \"If we'd had a box of matches with us we might have lighted a fire!\"  sighed Beata. \"Why _didn't_ we bring some?\"    \"Why didn't we look at the tide and get home in decent time? It's no good  crying over spilt milk!\" grunted Merle rather crossly.    After that they all subsided into silence for a while. There was no sound  except the monotonous lap of the waves. The sea-gulls and cormorants had  flown past at sunset and gone to roost. The absolute quiet, and the dark  shadows, and the silver light of the moon gave such an eerie atmosphere  to the scene that presently Fay could stand it no longer.    \"I guess I'll stir up the spooks!\" she remarked, and scrambling to her  feet she made a trumpet of her hands and called out a loud \"Coo-o-ee.\"    To the immense astonishment of everybody an answering shout came from  somewhere across the water. Instantly all sprang up and woke the echoes  with their loudest possible lung-power. Before long came a splash of  oars, and a boat, with a lantern fastened to its bow, entered the cove.  It advanced cautiously to the rocks, and a tall boyish figure sprang out  and held it steady, while some one in a fisherman's jersey stretched out  a strong hand to help the girls to enter. Only when they were safely  seated and the moonlight shone on their faces did Mavis recognise their  rescuers.    \"Mr. Penruddock--and surely not _Bevis_!\" she exclaimed.    He enjoyed her amazement.    \"I've got the week-end. There's been 'flu' at school, so they've sent  some of us off while Matron fumigates the rooms. I thought I'd find you  at the farm. There was a pretty to-do when it grew dark and you didn't  turn up. The Doctor went to the Vicarage to ask if you were there, and  they said you'd gone along the rocks fishing. So we took the boat and  came to look for you. I say, you were in a jolly old mess, weren't you?  Rather cold for sleeping out?\"    \"If we'd known you were coming over we wouldn't have started.\"    \"I didn't know myself till the last minute. I'll bike over to Durracombe  to-morrow afternoon if I may? I haven't seen you and Merle for ages.  You've given Chagmouth people an excitement! I should think half the  town's waiting on the quay for you! We'd rather a business to find you.  But 'all's well that ends well,' isn't it?\"          CHAPTER VII    Musical Stars      Mavis and Merle had not seen Bevis since last July, so they had an  immense amount to talk about when he came over to Bridge House on the  following afternoon. They had to tell him all their adventures during the  summer holidays and about the changes at 'The Moorings,' and he also had  much to relate about his own school and his future plans. Though he was  now squire of Chagmouth, he took his new honours very quietly and made no  fuss about them.    \"It's something to feel I'm back at the old Coll. and can go on to  Cambridge,\" he acknowledged in reply to the girls' questions. \"The  lawyers are very decent to me and give me pretty well all I want. In the  spring I'm going to have a yacht of my own! They've promised me that.  I'll take you both out for a sail in it.\"    \"Oh, do! We shall just live for Easter!\" rejoiced the girls.    \"I wish it was holidays all the time!\" added Merle. \"What fun we'd have  in your yacht!\"    Such a wish, however, could certainly not be realised.    Bevis was due back at Shelton College, and 'The Moorings' claimed both  Mavis and Merle. School might not be as exciting as yachting, but it had  its interests. There was the Magazine, of which Mavis was editress, and  to which many spicy items were contributed; there was the Entertainments  Club, which was getting up a piece to act at the end of the term.    In connection with this society, alack! a tremendous squabble ensued. It  had fallen almost entirely into the hands of the boarders, and they  seemed determined to keep all its privileges to themselves. They fixed  upon a play, shared the cast among them, and held rehearsals in the  evenings. Mavis, Merle, and Muriel, the only day-girls on the Committee,  were furious.    \"Where do we come in?\" demanded Merle.    \"It's too cool to settle everything without consulting us! We're as much  on the Committee as you are! It's completely out of order!\"    \"Oh, what does it matter?\" said Nesta, with aggravating easiness. \"We  can't bother to be always holding meetings. We wanted to set to work at  once and rehearse, and there weren't enough parts to include day-girls.  Can't you act audience for once? You seem very anxious to show off!\"    \"It's the pot calling the kettle black then, if we do!\" retorted Muriel.  \"What about yourselves, I should like to know?\"    The worst of it was that Miss Mitchell seemed to take the side of the  boarders.    \"I can't have you day-girls coming in the evenings to rehearse!\" she  decided. \"No, I can't allow you to stay at four o'clock either, because  the boarders must get their walk before tea. It would upset all our  arrangements. Perhaps we may put some of you in a tableau, because that  really wouldn't need much preparation.\"    A tableau! The day-girls felt much insulted! Miss Mitchell, who had seen  them act in the history class, ought not thus to scout their talents.  Merle took the matter particularly to heart because of her adoration for  the new mistress. She was furiously jealous of the boarders, who could  sit at meal-times at the same table as her idol, and could indulge in  private chats with her during the evenings. Miss Mitchell was perfectly  well aware of Merle's infatuation, but did not encourage it too deeply.  She meant to be quite impartial, and to have no favourites. Moreover, she  was very modern and unsentimental, and disliked what she called  'schoolgirl gush.' She had been the subject of violent admirations  before, and knew how soon they were apt to cool down. She was perfectly  nice to Merle, but a little off-hand, and never showed her any  preference. This line of treatment rather aggravated Merle's symptoms  instead of curbing the tendency.    \"I'll _make_ her like me!\" she said to herself stubbornly.    The siege laid to the teacher's heart progressed slowly, partly because  Merle's tactics were noticed by the others and became somewhat of a joke.  Merle had placed a daily buttonhole of flowers upon the teacher's desk,  but, led by Muriel, the Fifth form rallied, and one morning each of them  appeared with a kindred posy and deposited her offering. Miss Mitchell  turned quite pink at the sight of the eleven floral trophies. She was not  absolutely sure how far it was meant for a 'rag.'    \"This looks like a nature study competition!\" she remarked. \"I'm sure  it's very kind of you all to bring me flowers, but unless it's my  birthday or some special occasion I'm afraid I really don't know what to  do with them. You can put them all in water at eleven, Nesta, but you  mustn't waste time now fetching vases.\"    Merle, of course, never presented any flowers again. She brought a book  to school one day that she had heard Miss Mitchell express a wish to look  at, and, after lingering about in the classroom, plucked up courage to  interrupt her idol, who was correcting exercises, and offer the loan of  it.    The mistress, with her finger held to mark her place, looked up and shook  her head.    \"I've really no time for reading, thanks! At present my days are full  from morning till night.\"    As direct means failed Merle "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],[0,"Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#13)"],[1," declaring war on  superstition, and setting out to purify the religious notions of the  people.    Not a breath of this ample spiritual development of the Jews of Arabic  Spain reached the Jews living in the Christian countries of Europe.  Their circumstances were too grievous, and in sombreness their inner  life matched their outer estate. Their horizon was as contracted as  the streets of the Jewries in which they were penned. The crusades  (beginning in 1096) clearly showed the Jews of France and Germany what  sentiments their neighbors cherished towards them. They were the first  returns which Christianity paid the Jewish people for its old-time  teaching of religion. The descendants of the \"chosen people,\" the  originators of the Bible, were condemned to torture of a sort to  exhaust their spiritual heritage. Judaism suffered the tragic fate of  King Lear. Was it conceivable that the horrors--the rivers of blood,  the groans of massacred communities, the serried ranks of martyrs, the  ever-haunting fear of the morrow--should fail to leave traces in the  character of Judaism? The Jewish people realized its imminent danger.  It convulsively held fast to its precious relics, clung to the pillars  of its religion, which it regarded as the only asylum. The Jewish  spirit again withdrew from the outer world. It gave itself up wholly  to the study of the Talmud. In northern France and in Germany,  Talmudic learning degenerated into the extreme of scholastic pedantry,  the lot of every branch of science that is lopped off from the main  trunk of knowledge, and vegetates in a heavy, dank atmosphere, lacking  light and air. Rashi (1064-1105), whose genial activity began before  the first crusade, opened up Jewish religious literature to the  popular mind, by his systematic commentaries on the Bible and the  Talmud. On the other hand, the Tossafists, the school of commentators  succeeding him, by their petty quibbling and hairsplitting casuistry  made the Talmudic books more intricate and less intelligible. Such  being the intellectual bias of the age, a sober, rationalistic  philosophy could not assert itself. In lieu of an Ibn Ezra or a  Maimonides, we have Jehuda Hachassid and Eliezer of Worms, with their  mystical books of devotion, _Sefer Chassidim, Rokeach_, etc.,  filled with pietistic reflections on the other world, in which the  earth figures as a \"vale of tears.\" Poetry likewise took on the dismal  hue of its environment. Instead of the varied lyrical notes of Gabirol  and Halevi, who sang the weal and woe, not only of the nation, but  also of the individual, and lost themselves in psychologic analysis,  there now fall upon our ear the melancholy, heartrending strains of  synagogue poetry, the harrowing outcries that forced themselves from  the oppressed bosoms of the hunted people, the prayerful lamentations  that so often shook the crumbling walls of the medieval synagogues at  the very moment when, full of worshipers, they were fired by the  inhuman crusaders. A mighty chord reverberates in this poetry:  _Morituri te salutant_.    One small spot there was, in the whole of Europe, in which Jews could  still hope to endure existence and enjoy a measure of security. This  was Southern France, or the Provence. The population of Provence had  assimilated the culture of the neighboring country, Arabic Spain, and  become the mediator between it and the rest of Europe. This work of  mediation was undertaken primarily by the Jews. In the twelfth century  several universities existed in Provence, which were frequented in  great numbers by students from all countries. At these universities  the teachers of philosophy, medicine, and other branches of science  were for the most part Jews. The rationalistic philosophy of the  Spanish Jews was there proclaimed _ex cathedra_. The Tibbonides  translated all the more important works of the Jewish thinkers of  Spain from Arabic into Hebrew. The Kimchis devoted themselves to  grammatical studies and the investigation of the Bible. In  Montpellier, Narbonne, and Lunel, intellectual work was in full swing.  Rational ideas gradually leavened the masses of the Provencal  population. Conscience freed from intellectual trammels began to  revolt against the oppression exercised by the Roman clergy. Through  the Albigensian heresy, Innocent III, founder of the papal power, had  his attention directed to the Jews, whom he considered the dangerous  protagonists of rationalism. The \"heresy\" was stifled, Provence in all  her magnificence fell a prey to the Roman mania for destruction, and,  on the ruins of a noble civilization, the Dominican Inquisition raged  with all its horrors (1213).    Thenceforward the Catholic Church devoted herself to a hostile watch  upon the Jews. Either she persecuted them directly through her  Inquisition, or indirectly through her omnipotent influence on kings  and peoples. In the hearts of the citizens of medieval Europe, the  flame of religious hatred was enkindled, and religious hatred served  as a cloak for the basest passions. Jewish history from that time on  became a history of uninterrupted suffering. The Lateran Council  declared the Jews to be outcasts, and designed a peculiar,  dishonorable badge for them, a round patch of yellow cloth, to be worn  on their upper garment (1215). In France the Jews became by turns the  victims of royal rapacity and the scapegoats of popular fanaticism.  Massacres, confiscations, banishments followed by dearly purchased  permission to return, by renewed restrictions, persecutions, and  oppressions--these were the measures that characterized the treatment  of the Jews in France until their final expulsion (1394). In Germany  the Jews were not so much hated as despised. They were _servi  camerae_, serfs of the state, and as such had to pay oppressive  taxes. Besides, they were limited to the meanest trades and to usury  and peddling. They were shut up in their narrow Jewries, huddled in  wretched cabins, which clustered about the dilapidated synagogue in a  shamefaced way. What strange homes! What gigantic misery, what  boundless suffering dumbly borne, was concealed in those crumbling,  curse-laden dwellings! And yet, how resplendent they were with  spiritual light, what exalted virtues, what lofty heroism they  harbored! In those gloomy, tumbledown Jew houses, intellectual  endeavor was at white heat. The torch of faith blazed clear in them,  and on the pure domestic hearth played a gentle flame. In the abject,  dishonored son of the Ghetto was hidden an intellectual giant. In his  nerveless body, bent double by suffering, and enveloped in the shabby  old cloak still further disfigured by the yellow wheel, dwelt the soul  of a thinker. The son of the Ghetto might have worn his badge with  pride, for in truth it was a medal of distinction awarded by the papal  Church to the Jews, for dauntlessness and courage. The awkward, puny  Jew in his way was stronger and braver than a German knight armed  cap-a-pie, for he was penetrated by the faith that \"moves mountains.\"  And when the worst came to the worst, he demonstrated his courage.  When his peaceful home was stormed by the bestialized hordes of  Armleder, or the drunken bands of the Flagellants, or the furious  avengers of the \"Black Death,\" he did not yield, did not purchase life  by disgraceful treason. With invincible courage he put his head under  the executioner's axe, and breathed forth his heroic spirit with the  enthusiastic cry: \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is One.\"    At length the turn of the Spanish Jews arrived. For the unbroken peace  they had enjoyed, they had to atone by centuries of unexampled  suffering. By degrees, the Arabs were forced out of the Pyrenean  Peninsula, and the power they had to abdicate was assumed by the  Catholic kings of Castile and Aragon. In 1236 occurred the fall of  Cordova, the most important centre of Arabic Jewish culture.  Thereafter Arab power held sway only in the province of Granada. The  fortunes of the Spanish Jews underwent a calamitous change. The kings  and the upper ten thousand were, indeed, favorably disposed toward  them. At the courts of Castile and Aragon, the Jews were active as  ministers, physicians, astronomers. But the people, incited by the  propaganda of the clerics, nursed frightful hatred against the Jews,  not only as \"infidels,\" but also as intellectual aristocrats. The rage  of the populace was the combustible material in the terrific  explosions that occurred periodically, in the bloody saturnalia of the  Pastouraux (1320), in the Black Death riots (1348), in the massacre of  Seville (1391).    Dire blows of fortune were unable to weigh down the Spanish Jew,  accustomed to independence, as they did the German Jew. He carried his  head proudly on high, for he was conscious that in all respects he  stood above the rabble pursuing him, above its very leaders, the  clerics. In spite of untoward fate his mental development proceeded,  but inevitably it was modified by the trend of the times. By the side  of the philosophic tendency of the previous age, a mystical tendency  appeared in literature. The Kabbala, with its mist-shrouded symbolism,  so grateful to the feelings and the imagination, chimed in better than  rationalistic philosophy with the depressed humor under which the  greater part of the Jews were then laboring. Another force  antagonistic to rationalistic philosophy was the Rabbinism  transplanted from France and Germany. The controversy between  Rabbinism and philosophy, which dragged itself through three-quarters  of a century (1232-1305), ended in the formal triumph of Rabbinism.  However, philosophic activity merely languished, it did not cease  entirely; in fact, the three currents for some time ran along parallel  with one another. Next to the pillars of Rabbinism, Asheri, Rashba,  Isaac ben Sheshet, loomed up the philosophers, Gersonides (Ralbag),  Kreskas, and Albo,"]]]
