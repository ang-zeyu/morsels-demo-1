[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#13)"],[1," the best motives.    'No,' said Gethryn wearily, 'it isn't a puncture. I always let the air  out when I'm riding. It looks so much better, don't you think so? Why  did they let you out? Good-bye.'    And feeling a little more comfortable after this outburst, he wheeled  his bicycle on into Anfield High Street.    Minds in the village of Anfield worked with extraordinary rapidity. The  first person of whom he asked the way to the Junction answered the  riddle almost without thinking. He left his machine out in the road and  went on to the platform. The first thing that caught his eye was the  station clock with its hands pointing to five past four. And when he  realized that, his uncle's train having left a clear half hour before,  his labours had all been for nothing, the full bitterness of life came  home to him.    He was turning away from the station when he stopped. Something else  had caught his eye. On a bench at the extreme end of the platform sat a  youth. And a further scrutiny convinced the Bishop of the fact that the  youth was none other than Master Reginald Farnie, late of Beckford, and  shortly, or he would know the reason why, to be once more of Beckford.  Other people besides himself, it appeared, could miss trains.    Farnie was reading one of those halfpenny weeklies which--with a nerve  which is the only creditable thing about them--call themselves comic.  He did not see the Bishop until a shadow falling across his paper  caused him to look up.    It was not often that he found himself unequal to a situation. Monk in  a recent conversation had taken him aback somewhat, but his feelings on  that occasion were not to be compared with what he felt on seeing the  one person whom he least desired to meet standing at his side. His jaw  dropped limply, _Comic Blitherings_ fluttered to the ground.    The Bishop was the first to speak. Indeed, if he had waited for Farnie  to break the silence, he would have waited long.    'Get up,' he said. Farnie got up.    'Come on.' Farnie came.    'Go and get your machine,' said Gethryn. 'Hurry up. And now you will  jolly well come back to Beckford, you little beast.'    But before that could be done there was Gethryn's back wheel to be  mended. This took time. It was nearly half past four before they  started.    'Oh,' said Gethryn, as they were about to mount, 'there's that money. I  was forgetting. Out with it.'    Ten pounds had been the sum Farnie had taken from the study. Six was  all he was able to restore. Gethryn enquired after the deficit.    'I gave it to Monk,' said Farnie.    To Gethryn, in his present frame of mind, the mere mention of Monk was  sufficient to uncork the vials of his wrath.    'What the blazes did you do that for? What's Monk got to do with it?'    'He said he'd get me sacked if I didn't pay him,' whined Farnie.    This was not strictly true. Monk had not said. He had hinted. And he  had hinted at flogging, not expulsion.    'Why?' pursued the Bishop. 'What had you and Monk been up to?'    Farnie, using his out-of-bounds adventures as a foundation, worked up a  highly artistic narrative of doings, which, if they had actually been  performed, would certainly have entailed expulsion. He had judged  Gethryn's character correctly. If the matter had been simply a case for  a flogging, the Bishop would have stood aside and let the thing go on.  Against the extreme penalty of School law he felt bound as a matter of  family duty to shield his relative. And he saw a bad time coming for  himself in the very near future. Either he must expose Farnie, which he  had resolved not to do, or he must refuse to explain his absence from  the M.C.C. match, for by now there was not the smallest chance of his  being able to get back in time for the visitors' innings. As he rode on  he tried to imagine what would happen in consequence of that desertion,  and he could not do it. His crime was, so far as he knew, absolutely  without precedent in the School history.    As they passed the cricket field he saw that it was empty. Stumps were  usually drawn early in the M.C.C. match if the issue of the game was  out of doubt, as the Marylebone men had trains to catch. Evidently this  had happened today. It might mean that the School had won easily--they  had looked like making a big score when he had left the ground--in  which case public opinion would be more lenient towards him. After a  victory a school feels that all's well that ends well. But it might, on  the other hand, mean quite the reverse.    He put his machine up, and hurried to the study. Several boys, as he  passed them, looked curiously at him, but none spoke to him.    Marriott was in the study, reading a book. He was still in flannels,  and looked as if he had begun to change but had thought better of it.  As was actually the case.    'Hullo,' he cried, as Gethryn appeared. 'Where the dickens have you  been all the afternoon? What on earth did you go off like that for?'    'I'm sorry, old chap,' said the Bishop, 'I can't tell you. I shan't be  able to tell anyone.'    'But, man! Try and realize what you've done. Do you grasp the fact that  you've gone and got the School licked in the M.C.C. match, and that we  haven't beaten the M.C.C. for about a dozen years, and that if you'd  been there to bowl we should have walked over this time? Do try and  grasp the thing.'    'Did they win?'    'Rather. By a wicket. Two wickets, I mean. We made 213. Your bowling  would just have done it.'    Gethryn sat down.    'Oh Lord,' he said blankly, 'this is awful!'    'But, look here, Bishop,' continued Marriott, 'this is all rot. You  can't do a thing like this, and then refuse to offer any explanation,  and expect things to go on just as usual.'    'I don't,' said Gethryn. 'I know there's going to be a row, but I can't  explain. You'll have to take me on trust.'    'Oh, as far as I am concerned, it's all right,' said Marriott. 'I know  you wouldn't be ass enough to do a thing like that without a jolly good  reason. It's the other chaps I'm thinking about. You'll find it jolly  hard to put Norris off, I'm afraid. He's most awfully sick about the  match. He fielded badly, which always makes him shirty. Jephson, too.  You'll have a bad time with Jephson. His one wish after the match was  to have your gore and plenty of it. Nothing else would have pleased him  a bit. And think of the chaps in the House, too. Just consider what a  pull this gives Monk and his mob over you. The House'll want some  looking after now, I fancy.'    'And they'll get it,' said Gethryn. 'If Monk gives me any of his  beastly cheek, I'll knock his head off.'    But in spite of the consolation which such a prospect afforded him, he  did not look forward with pleasure to the next day, when he would have  to meet Norris and the rest. It would have been bad in any case. He did  not care to think what would happen when he refused to offer the  slightest explanation.          [10]    IN WHICH A CASE IS FULLY DISCUSSED      Gethryn was right in thinking that the interviews would be unpleasant.  They increased in unpleasantness in arithmetical progression, until  they culminated finally in a terrific encounter with the justly  outraged Norris.    Reece was the first person to institute inquiries, and if everybody had  resembled him, matters would not have been so bad for Gethryn. Reece  possessed a perfect genius for minding his own business. The dialogue  when they met was brief.    'Hullo,' said Reece.    'Hullo,' said the Bishop.    'Where did you get to yesterday?' said Reece.    'Oh, I had to go somewhere,' said the Bishop vaguely.    'Oh? Pity. Wasn't a bad match.' And that was all the comment Reece made  on the situation.    Gethryn went over to the chapel that morning with an empty sinking  feeling inside him. He was quite determined to offer no single word of  explanation, and he felt that that made the prospect all the worse.  There was a vast uncertainty in his mind as to what was going to  happen. Nobody could actually do anything to him, of course. It would  have been a decided relief to him if anybody had tried that line of  action, for moments occur when the only thing that can adequately  soothe the wounded spirit, is to hit straight from the shoulder at  someone. The punching-ball is often found useful under these  circumstances. As he was passing Jephson's House he nearly ran into  somebody who was coming out.    'Be firm, my moral pecker,' thought Gethryn, and braced himself up for  conflict.    'Well, Gethryn?' said Mr Jephson.    The question 'Well?' especially when addressed by a master to a boy, is  one of the few questions to which there is literally no answer. You can  look sheepish, you can look defiant, or you can look surprised  according to the state of your conscience. But anything in the way of  verbal response is impossible.    Gethryn attempted no verbal response.    'Well, Gethryn,' went on Mr Jephson, 'was it pleasant up the river  yesterday?'    Mr Jephson always preferred the rapier of sarcasm to the bludgeon of  abuse.    'Yes, sir,' said Gethryn, 'very pleasant.' He did not mean to be  massacred without a struggle.    'What!' cried Mr Jephson. 'You actually mean to say that you did go up  the river?'    'No, sir.'    'Then what do you mean?'    'It is always pleasant up the river on a fine day,' said Gethryn.    His opponent, to use a metaphor suitable to a cricket master, changed  his action. He abandoned sarcasm and condescended to direct inquiry.    'Where were you yesterday afternoon?' he said.    The Bishop, like Mr Hurry Bungsho Jabberjee, B.A., became at once the  silent tomb.    'Did you hear what I said, Gethryn?' (icily). 'Where were you yesterday  afternoon?'    'I can't say, sir.'    These words may convey two meanings. They may imply ignorance, in which  case the speaker should be led gently off to the nearest asylum. Or  they may imply obstinacy. Mr Jephson decided that in the present case"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6986"],[0,"Hygienic Physiology : with Special Reference to the Use of Alcoholic Drinks and (#13)"],[1,"not the way to increase one's  power of endurance. The system is made more vigorous by exercise and food;  not by exposure. In winter, we should wear warm shoes with thick soles,  and rubbers when it is damp. At night, and after exercise, we require  extra clothing. (See p. 295.)    DISEASES, ETC.--l. _Erysipelas_ is an inflammation (see Inflammation)  of the skin, and often begins in a spot not larger than a pin head, which  spreads with great rapidity. It is very commonly checked by the  application of a solution of iodine. The burning and contracting sensation  may be relieved by cloths wrung out of hot water.    2. _Eczema_ (Salt Rheum, etc.) is of constitutional origin. It is  characterized by an itching, burning, reddened eruption, in which a serous  discharge exudes and dries into crusts or scales. The skin thickens in  patches, and painful fissures are formed, which are irritated by exposure  to air or water. Eczema denotes debility. It occurs in various forms, and,  like erysipelas, should be treated by a physician.    3. _Corns_ are thickened cuticle, caused by pressure or friction.  They most frequently occur on the feet; but are produced on the  shoemaker's knee by constant hammering, and on the soldier's shoulder by  the rubbing of his musket. This hard portion irritates the sensitive cutis  beneath, and so causes pain. A corn will soften in hot water, when it may  be pared with a sharp knife. If the cause be removed, the corn will not  return.    4. _Ingrowing Nails_ are caused by pressure, which forces the edge of  the toe nail into the flesh. They may be cured by carefully cutting away  the part which has mal-grown, and then scraping the back of the nail till  it is thin, making a small incision in the center, at the top. The two  portions, uniting, will draw away the nail from the flesh at the edge.  Ingrowing nails may be prevented by wearing broad-toed shoes.    5. _Warts_ are overgrown papillæ (Fig. 24). They may generally be  removed by the application of glacial acetic acid, or a drop of nitric  acid, repeated until the entire structure is softened. Care must be taken  to keep the acid from touching the neighboring skin. The capricious  character of warts has given rise to the popular delusion concerning the  influence of charms upon them.    6. _Chilblain_ is a local inflammation affecting generally the feet,  the hands, or the lobes of the ear. Liability to it usually passes away  with manhood. It is not caused by \"freezing the feet,\" as many suppose,  though attacks are brought on, or aggravated, by exposure to cold,  followed by sudden warming. Chilblain is subject to daily congestion (see  Congestion), manifested by itching, soreness, etc., commonly occurring at  night. The best preventive is a uniform temperature, and careful  protection against the cold by warm clothing, especially for the feet.    PRACTICAL QUESTIONS.    1.

The Organs of Respiration and the Voice are the _larynx_, the  _trachea_, and the _lungs_.    DESCRIPTION OF THE ORGANS OF THE VOICE.--l. _The Larynx_.--In the  neck, is a prominence sometimes called Adam's apple. It is the front of  the _larynx_. This is a small triangular, cartilaginous box, placed  just below the root of the tongue, and at the top of the windpipe. The  opening into it from the throat is called the _glottis_; and the  cover, the _epiglottis_ (_epi_, upon; _glotta_, the tongue). The  latter is a spoon-shaped lid, which opens when we breathe, but, by  a nice arrangement, shuts when we try to swallow, and so lets our  food slip over it into the _sophagus_ (e-sof'-a-gus), the tube leading  from the pharynx to the stomach (Fig. 27).    If we laugh or talk when we swallow, our food is apt to \"go the wrong  way,\" _i. e._, little particles pass into the larynx, and the  tickling sensation which they produce forces us to cough in order to expel  the intruders.    2. _The Vocal Cords_.--On each side of the _glottis_ are the so-  called _vocal cords_. They are not really cords, but merely elastic  membranes projecting from the sides of the box across the opening.  [Footnote: The cartilages and vocal cords may be readily seen in the  larynx of an ox or sheep. If the flesh be cut off, the cartilages will  dry, and will keep for years.] When not in use, they spread apart and  leave a V-shaped orifice (Fig. "]]]
