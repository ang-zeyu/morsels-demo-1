In her  sorrow, she sat down at the wayside by the virgin's well, where the  people of Eleusis come to draw water, under the shadow of an olive-  tree.  She seemed as an aged woman whose time of child-bearing is  gone by, and from whom the gifts of Aphrodite have been withdrawn,  like one of the hired servants, who nurse the children or keep house,  in kings' palaces.  And the daughters of Celeus, four of them, like  goddesses, possessing the flower of their youth, Callidice,  Cleisidice, Demo, and Callithoe the eldest of them, coming to draw  water that they [86] might bear it in their brazen pitchers to their  father's house, saw Demeter and knew her not.  The gods are hard for  men to recognise.    \"They asked her kindly what she did there, alone; and Demeter  answered, dissemblingly, that she was escaped from certain pirates,  who had carried her from her home and meant to sell her as a slave.  Then they prayed her to abide there while they returned to the  palace, to ask their mother's permission to bring her home.    \"Demeter bowed her head in assent; and they, having filled their  shining vessels with water, bore them away, rejoicing in their  beauty. They came quickly to their father's house, and told their  mother what they had seen and heard.  Their mother bade them return,  and hire the woman for a great price; and they, like the hinds or  young heifers leaping in the fields in spring, fulfilled with the  pasture, holding up the folds of their raiment, sped along the hollow  road-way, their hair, in colour like the crocus, floating about their  shoulders as they went.  They found the glorious goddess still  sitting by the wayside, unmoved.  Then they led her to their father's  house; and she, veiled from head to foot, in her deep grief, followed  them on the way, and her blue robe gathered itself as she walked, in  many folds about her feet.  They came to the house, and passed  through the sunny porch, where their mother, Metaneira, was [87]  sitting against one of the pillars of the roof, having a young child  in her bosom.  They ran up to her; but Demeter crossed the threshold,  and, as she passed through, her head rose and touched the roof, and  her presence filled the doorway with a divine brightness.    \"Still they did not wholly recognise her.  After a time she was made  to smile.  She refused to drink wine, but tasted of a cup mingled of  water and barley, flavoured with mint.  It happened that Metaneira  had lately borne a child.  It had come beyond hope, long after its  elder brethren, and was the object of a peculiar tenderness and of  many prayers with all.  Demeter consented to remain, and become the  nurse of this child.  She took the child in her immortal hands, and  placed it in her fragrant bosom; and the heart of the mother  rejoiced.  Thus Demeter nursed Demophoon.  And the child grew like a  god, neither sucking the breast, nor eating bread; but Demeter daily  anointed it with ambrosia, as if it had indeed been the child of a  god, breathing sweetly over it and holding it in her bosom; and at  nights, when she lay alone with the child, she would hide it secretly  in the red strength of the fire, like a brand; for her heart yearned  towards it, and she would fain have given to it immortal youth.    \"But the foolishness of his mother prevented it.  For a suspicion  growing up within her, she awaited her time, and one night peeped in  upon [88] them, and thereupon cried out in terror at what she saw.  And the goddess heard her; and a sudden anger seizing her, she  plucked the child from the fire and cast it on the ground,--the child  she would fain have made immortal, but who must now share the common  destiny of all men, though some inscrutable grace should still be  his, because he had lain for awhile on the knees and in the bosom of  the goddess.    \"Then Demeter manifested herself openly.  She put away the mask of  old age, and changed her form, and the spirit of beauty breathed  about her.  A fragrant odour fell from her raiment, and her flesh  shone from afar; the long yellow hair descended waving over her  shoulders, and the great house was filled as with the brightness of  lightning.  She passed out through the halls; and Metaneira fell to  the earth, and was speechless for a long time, and remembered not to  lift the child from the ground.  But the sisters, hearing its piteous  cries, leapt from their beds and ran to it.  Then one of them lifted  the child from the earth, and wrapped it in her bosom, and another  hastened to her mother's chamber to awake her: they came round the  child, and washed away the flecks of the fire from its panting body,  and kissed it tenderly all about: but the anguish of the child ceased  not; the arms of other and different nurses were about to enfold it.    \"So, all night, trembling with fear, they [89] sought to propitiate  the glorious goddess; and in the morning they told all to their  father, Celeus.  And he, according to the commands of the goddess,  built a fair temple; and all the people assisted; and when it was  finished every man departed to his own home.  Then Demeter returned,  and sat down within the temple-walls, and remained still apart from  the company of the gods, alone in her wasting regret for her daughter  Persephone.    \"And, in her anger, she sent upon the earth a year of grievous  famine.  The dry seed remained hidden in the soil; in vain the oxen  drew the ploughshare through the furrows; much white seed-corn fell  fruitless on the earth, and the whole human race had like to have  perished, and the gods had no more service of men, unless Zeus had  interfered.  First he sent Iris, afterwards all the gods, one by one,  to turn Demeter from her anger; but none was able to persuade her;  she heard their words with a hard countenance, and vowed by no means  to return to Olympus, nor to yield the fruit of the earth, until her  eyes had seen her lost daughter again.  Then, last of all, Zeus sent  Hermes into the kingdom of the dead, to persuade Aidoneus to suffer  his bride to return to the light of day.  And Hermes found the king  at home in his palace, sitting on a couch, beside the shrinking  Persephone, consumed within herself by desire for her mother.  A  doubtful smile passed over [90] the face of Aidoneus; yet he obeyed  the message, and bade Persephone return; yet praying her a little to  have gentle thoughts of him, nor judge him too hardly, who was also  an immortal god.  And Persephone arose up quickly in great joy; only,  ere she departed, he caused her to eat a morsel of sweet pomegranate,  designing secretly thereby, that she should not remain always upon  earth, but might some time return to him.  And Aidoneus yoked the  horses to his chariot; and Persephone ascended into it; and Hermes  took the reins in his hands and drove out through the infernal halls;  and the horses ran willingly; and they two quickly passed over the  ways of that long journey, neither the waters of the sea, nor of the  rivers, nor the deep ravines of the hills, nor the cliffs of the  shore, resisting them; till at last Hermes placed Persephone before  the door of the temple where her mother was; who, seeing her, ran out  quickly to meet her, like a Maenad coming down a mountain-side, dusky  with woods.    \"So they spent all that day together in intimate communion, having  many things to hear and tell.  Then Zeus sent to them Rhea, his  venerable mother, the oldest of divine persons, to bring them back  reconciled, to the company of the gods; and he ordained that  Persephone should remain two parts of the year with her mother, and  one third part only with her husband, in the kingdom of the dead.  So  Demeter suffered [91] the earth to yield its fruits once more, and  the land was suddenly laden with leaves and flowers and waving corn.  Also she visited Triptolemus and the other princes of Eleusis, and  instructed them in the performance of her sacred rites,--those  mysteries of which no tongue may speak.  Only, blessed is he whose  eyes have seen them; his lot after death is not as the lot of other  men!\"    In the story of Demeter, as in all Greek myths, we may trace the  action of three different influences, which have moulded it with  varying effects, in three successive phases of its development.  There is first its half-conscious, instinctive, or mystical, phase,  in which, under the form of an unwritten legend, living from mouth to  mouth, and with details changing as it passes from place to place,  there lie certain primitive impressions of the phenomena of the  natural world.  We may trace it next in its conscious, poetical or  literary, phase, in which the poets become the depositaries of the  vague instinctive product of the popular imagination, and handle it  with a purely literary interest, fixing its outlines, and simplifying  or developing its situations.  Thirdly, the myth passes into the  ethical phase, in which the persons and the incidents of the poetical  narrative are realised as abstract symbols, because intensely  characteristic examples, of moral or spiritual conditions. [92]  Behind the adventures of the stealing of Persephone and the  wanderings of Demeter in search of her, as we find them in the  Homeric hymn, we may discern the confused conception, under which  that early age, in which the myths were first created, represented to  itself those changes in physical "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4042"],[0,"Mozart: The Man and the Artist, as Revealed in His Own Words (#13)"],[1,"  of superior talent (which I can not deny I am, without doing  wrong) deteriorates if he remains continually in one place.\"    (Paris, September 11, 1778, to his father, who had secured an  appointment for him at Salzburg which he was loath to accept. He  asked that the Archbishop permit him to travel once in two years.  He feared that he \"would find no congenial society\" in Salzburg,  where, moreover, music did not stand in large appreciation.  Mozart's subsequent experiences were of the most pitiable  character.)    164. \"Write me, how is Mr. Canary? Does he still sing? Does he  still pipe? Do you know why I am thinking of the canary? Because  there is one in our anteroom that makes the same little sounds as  ours.\"    (Naples, May 19, 1770, to his sister. Mozart was very fond of  animals. In a letter from Vienna to his sister on August 21,  1773, he writes: \"How is Miss Bimbes? Please present all manner  of compliments to her.\" \"Miss Bimbes\" was a dog. At another time  he wrote a pathetic little poem on the death of a starling. While  in the midst of the composition and rehearsal of \"Idomeneo\" he  wrote to his father: \"Give Pimperl (a dog) a pinch of Spanish  snuff, a good wine-biscuit and three busses.\")    165. \"Because of my disposition which leans towards a quiet,  domestic life rather than to boisterousness, and the fact that  since my youth I have never given a thought to my linen, clothing  or such things, I can think of nothing more necessary than a  wife. I assure you that I frequently spend money unnecessarily  because I am negligent of these things. I am convinced that I  could get along better than I do now on the same income if I had  a wife. How many unnecessary expenditures would be saved? Others  are added, it is true, but you know in advance what they are and  can adjust them;--in a word you lead a regulated life. In my  opinion an unmarried man lives only half a life; that is my  conviction and I can not help it. I have resolved the matter over  and over in my mind and am of the same opinion still.\"    (Vienna, December 15, 1781, to his father.)    166. \"At present I have only one pupil....I could have several if  I were to lower my fee; but as soon as one does that one loses  credit. My price is twelve lessons for six ducats, and I make it  understood besides that I give the lessons as a favor. I would  rather have three pupils who pay well than six who pay ill. I am  writing this to you to prevent you from thinking that it is  selfishness which prevents me from sending you more than thirty  ducats.\"    (Vienna, June 16, 1781, to his father. [In American money  Mozart's fee is represented by $1.20 per lesson. H.E.K.])    167. \"I could not go about Vienna looking like a tramp,  particularly just at this time. My linen was pitiable; no servant  here has shirts of such coarse stuff as mine,--and that certainly  is a frightful thing for a man. Consequently there were again  expenditures. I had only one pupil; she suspended her lessons for  three weeks, and I was again the loser. One must not throw one's  self away here,--that is a first principle,--or one is ruined  forever. The most audacious man wins the day.\"    (Vienna, September 5, 1781, to his father, excusing himself for  not having made remittances.)    168. \"Resent anything and at once you receive smaller pay.  Besides all this the Emperor is a skinflint. If the Emperor wants  me he ought to pay for me; the mere honor of being in his employ  is not enough. If the Emperor were to offer me 1,000 florins and  a count 2,000, I should present my compliments to the Emperor and  go to the count,--assuming a guarantee, of course.\"    (Vienna, April 10, 1782, to his father. Mozart was not too  industrious in the pursuit of a court appointment, yet had reason  to be hopeful. Near the end of his short life the appointment  came from Joseph II, to whom Mozart had been too faithful.)    169. \"I described my manner of life to my father only recently,  and I will now repeat it to you. At six o'clock in the morning I  am already done with my friseur, and at seven I am fully dressed.  Thereupon I compose until nine o'clock. From nine to one I give  lessons; then I eat unless I am a guest at places where they dine  at two or even three o'clock,--as, for instance, today and  tomorrow with Countess Zichy and Countess Thun. I can not work  before five or six o'clock in the evening and I am often  prevented even then by a concert; if not I write till nine. Then  I go to my dear Constanze, where the delight of our meeting is  generally embittered by the words of her mother;--hence my desire  to free and save her as soon as possible. At half after ten or  eleven I am again at home. Since (owing to the occasional  concerts and the uncertainty as to whether or not I may be called  out) I can not depend on having time for composition in the  evening, I am in the habit (particularly when I come home early)  of writing something before I go to bed. Frequently I forget  myself and write till one o'clock,--then up again at six.\"    (Vienna, February 13, 1782, to his sister Marianne--Nannerl, as  he called her.)    170. \"We do not go to bed before 12 o'clock and get up half after  five or five, because nearly every day we take an early walk in  the Augarten.\"    (Vienna, May 26, 1784, to his father, to whom he complains of his  maid-servant who came from Salzburg and who had written to the  father that she was not permitted to sleep except between 11 and  6 o'clock.)    171. \"Now as to my mode of life: As soon as you were gone I  played two games of billiards with Herr von Mozart who wrote the  opera for Schickaneder's theatre; then I sold my nag for fourteen  ducats; then I had Joseph call my primus and bring a black  coffee, to which I smoked a glorious pipe of tobacco....At 5:30 I  went out of the door and took my favorite promenade through the  Glacis to the theatre. What do I see? What do I smell? It is the  primus with the cutlet Gusto! I eat to your health. It has just  struck 11 o'clock. Perhaps you are already asleep. Sh! sh! sh! I  do not want to wake you.\"    \"Saturday, the 8th. You ought to have seen me yesterday at  supper! I could not find the old dishes and therefore produced a  set as white as snow-flowers and had the wax candelabra in front  of me.\"    (Vienna, October 7, 1791, to his wife, who was taking the waters  at Baden. Mozart was fond of billiards and often played alone as  on this occasion. He was careful of his health and had been  advised by his physician to ride; but he could not acquire a  taste for the exercise--Hence the sale of his horse. The primus  was his valet, a servant found in every Viennese household at the  time. Out of the door through which he stepped on beginning his  walk to the theatre his funeral procession passed two months  later.)    172. \"I have done more work during the ten days that I have lived  here than in two months in any other lodgings; and if it were not  that I am too often harassed by gloomy thoughts which I can  dispel only by force, I could do still more, for I live  pleasantly, comfortably and cheaply.\"    (Vienna, June 27, 1788, to his friend Puchberg.)    173. \"I have no conveniences for writing there (i.e. at Baden),  and I want to avoid embarrassments as much as possible. Nothing  is more enjoyable than a quiet life and to obtain that one must  be industrious. I am glad to be that.\"    (Vienna, October 8, 1791, to his wife at Baden. Mozart probably  refers to work on his \"Requiem.\" He says further: \"If I had had  nothing to do I would have gone with you to spend the week.\")    174. \"Now the babe against my will, yet with my consent, has been  provided with a wet nurse. It was always my determination that,  whether she was able to do so or not, my wife was not to suckle  her child; but neither was the child to guzzle the milk of  another woman. I want it brought up on water as I and my sister  were, but...\"    (Vienna, June 8, 1783, to his father, the day after his first  child was born. The \"Dear, thick, fat little fellow\" died soon  after.)    175. \"Young as I am, I never go to bed without thinking that  possibly I may not be alive on the morrow; yet not one of the  many persons who know me can say that I am morose or melancholy.  For this happy disposition I thank my Creator daily, and wish  with all my heart that it were shared by all my fellows.\"    (Vienna, April 4, 1787, to his father, shortly before the  latter's death. Mozart himself died when, he was not quite  thirty-six years old.)    176. \"If it chances to be convenient I shall call on the Fischers  for a moment; longer than that I could not endure their warm room  and the wine at table. I know very well that people of their  class think they are bestowing the highest honors when they offer  these things, but I am not fond of such things,--still less of  such people.\"    (Vienna, December 22, 1781, to his sister. Mozart was acquainted  with the Fischer family from the time of his first journeys as a  child. The contrast which he draws between the artist and the  comfort-loving, commonplace citizen is diverting.)    177. \"The Viennese are a people who soon grow weary and  listless,--but only of the theatre. My forte is too popular to be  neglected. This, surely, is Clavierland!\"    (Spoken to Count Arco who had warned him against removing to  Vienna because of the fickleness of the Viennese public. He  wanted him to return to Salzburg.)    178. \"I am writing at a place called Reisenberg which is an  hour's distance from Vienna. I once stayed here over night; now I  shall remain a few days. The house is insignificant, but the  surroundings, the woods in which a grotto has been built as  natural as can be, are splendid and very pleasant.\"    (Vienna, July 13, 1781, to his father. Like Beethoven, Mozart  loved nature and wanted a garden about his home.)    179. \"I wish that my sister were here in Rome. I am sure she  would be pleased"]]]
