The  figure is nearly of the natural size.    Total length five inches and a half. Bill blueish, three quarters of an  inch from the angle of the mouth, and four-tenths from the nostrils, which  are ovately round, rather large, and simple, being entirely devoid of an  external membrane, but the base is partially covered with small thick-set,  short, setaceous feathers; between the eye and base of the bill are a few  weak and short hairs; the upper part of the head, as far as the nape, is  capped by deep-black, having a blueish gloss: between the nostrils and the  eye, as well as on the chin and throat, the colour is white, which changes  to a pale cinereous grey on the sides of the head and round the neck; the  ears at their base and margin of the eye tinged with yellow; the rest of  the upper plumage yellowish-olive. The under plumage on the lower part of  the neck and breast, the sides, and the inner wing-covers are clear yellow,  and from that to the vent white. Wings two inches long, the quills brown,  margined externally with olive and internally with yellow; the first and  second quill progressively shorter than the third and fourth, which are of  equal length. Tail short, slightly divaricated; olive, with whitish  marginal tips. Legs blueish-black; the three fore-toes are equally cleft,  but a membrane will be found connecting them equally at the base nearly as  far as the first joint.    Temminck must be mistaken in giving as a generic character to this genus,  that the external toe is connected to the middle one as far as the first  joint, and the inner toe cleft to the base; at least such is not the case  either in my specimens of this bird or in those of the Cayenne Shrike: and  they have been carefully relaxed in warm water, the best method of  ascertaining such peculiarities.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 33    [Illustration]    TAMYRIS Zeleucus.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Antennae arcuatae, clava terminali, crassata, lineari, obtusa, in      foeminis graciliore attenuata.

OBS. _Donovan's Indian Insects_, where that author has figured it by      mistake as a native of India.           *       *       *       *       *    This insect is the most common (although hitherto unfigured) of a striking  natural group belonging to the _Hesperidae_; it has therefore been selected  as the best example for the genus I have now formed them into. I have not  seen more than twelve or fourteen species, and these were all from  different parts of South America, to which I have no doubt the genus is  exclusively confined. The club of their antennae is very thick, obtuse, and  without any terminal hook. The bright red at the end of the abdomen  (improperly called by Fabricius the tail) is most conspicuous in the  female, which is also larger and having the wings more obtuse, of which the  upper and under surfaces are both alike.    The insects of this family fly with amazing rapidity (as is shown by the  thickness of their thorax, and the sharpness in the make of their wings),  generally frequenting openings of thick woods and alighting on leaves where  the sun strikes: I seldom saw them on flowers. Their wings when at rest are  half expanded in a horizontal direction. Their metamorphosis is unknown.    This individual species is scarce in the northern parts of Brazil, but  common in the southern provinces.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 34    [Illustration]    COLIAS Godartiana.    _Godart's Colias._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 5.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _C.

Palpi lengthened.           *       *       *       *       *    An inspection of a vast number of insects of this genus, with the  possession of nearly all the species noticed by authors, convinces me that  the insect now figured is perfectly distinct from any other. It is in the  cabinet of Mr. Haworth, who obligingly lent it me for comparison and  description, and is the only individual I have hitherto met with. The  prolongation of the palpi, which is even more obvious than in _C. Statira_,  is alone a specific distinction; and the form of the spots both on the  upper and under side differs very much in character from that insect, with  which it has the most affinity. It may be the _Papilio Drya_ of Fabr.  (omitting his references); but his description, whether intended for this  insect or any other, is so vague that I can see no advantage in retaining  it. Of the two bright silver spots beneath, one is oval, the other larger  and quadrangular.    I have named it in honour of M. Godart, the intelligent coadjutor of M.  Latreille in the entomological part of the _Encyclopedie Methodique_.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 35    [Illustration]    MITRA bifasciata.    _Double-banded Mitre._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 23.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _M.

One of these is now in my  father's cabinet, the other in that of Mrs. Bolton, of Storr's-hall,  Windermere. I have seen both, and they appear equally fine.    I cannot help considering this as a distinct species from _Mitra caffra_  (_Voluta caffra_ Linn.), with which it has hitherto been placed only as a  variety: it is much larger, the volutions more convex, but compressed on  the suture, and the whole shell (except near the point) perfectly smooth:  the beak or channel likewise, which in _M. caffra_ is short and nearly  straight, is in this lengthened and recurved. The mouth is very narrow  (occasioned by the outer lip being thick and slightly inflexed) and smooth  within, the terminal volutions slightly plaited, and the base of the shell  grooved.    The figures of Knorr and Martini are very bad, and give no correct idea of  the shell, except its colour.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 36    [Illustration]    ACHATINA perversa.    _Reverse Achatina._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 30.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _A.

This deviation  from the usual form of shells is sometimes accidental, as in our common  garden Snail and several others; while in some species it appears a  constant, and therefore a specific distinction. Such I apprehend is the  case with the shell now figured, a rare and very elegant species,  apparently not noticed by any writer; two or three existing in the British  Museum and one in my father's cabinet are all the specimens I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39472"],[0,"Zoological Illustrations, Volume 2 (#13)"],[1,"in  every branch of Zoology are always open to the scientific inquirer. It is  nearly allied to Pap. _Tros_, _Agavus_, _Ascarius_, and _Lysithous_  (Godart), particularly to the latter; yet it is obviously distinct from  either. These affinities lead me to think that it is a South American  insect. The figures will render any addition to the specific character  unnecessary.    I have named this insect to commemorate a most assiduous and observing  entomologist of the last age, Moses Harris, whose memory will be long  cherished by our Aurelians, and to whom the scientific are indebted for the  very accurate and excellent figures contained both in his own works, and in  those of Drury; indeed, he appears the only English artist who has  faithfully represented the short and nearly concealed _palpi_ peculiar to  this genus. The son of this excellent artist[1], still follows the  profession of his father, and, inheriting his abilities, deserves every  encouragement that the small circle of English entomologists, as well as  others, can give him.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 110    [Illustration]    CONUS cinctus,    _Purple tipped Admiral Cone._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 65.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _C. testa supra carinata, fulva, fasciis duobus albidis ornata; spirae      brevis, maculatae, basi depressa, anfractibus concavis sulcis duobus      insculptis, sutura alveata; basi granosa, purpurea._        Shell above carinated, fulvous, with two whitish bands; spire short,      spotted, the base depressed; the whorls concave with two depressed      lines; suture channelled; base granulated, purple.           *       *       *       *       *    This is a very beautiful, and, at the same time, very rare shell; it  formerly belonged to Mrs. Angus, at whose sale it passed into the cabinet  of Mr. Dubois. Its general appearance resembles very much that of _C.  Maldivus Lam._ known to our collectors by the name of the Spanish Admiral:  the spire will, however, at once distinguish it; each volution is strongly  concave in the middle, in which part are two or three delicate indented  lines, very near each other, and following the volutions; the suture also  is sufficiently open to be termed channelled; the spire is quite flattened  at the base, (forming a sharp ridge round the top of the body whorl), and  only prominent near the tip. In the Spanish Admiral Cone, the spire is  quite smooth, the whorls being flat, and in all the specimens I have seen,  (and they are many), the suture is quite closed up, though Lamarck  (probably mistaking the present shell) says, \"spira canaliculata;\" the  base, moreover, is narrowed, smooth, and black; not gibbous, granulated,  (or striated,) and purple, as in this shell.    A variety in my own cabinet presents some differences; the base is but  slightly granulated, and the tip not purple; these are, however,  subordinate characters, and constitute it only a variety.    I shall take an early opportunity of pointing out the differences between  _C. generalis_ and _Maldivus_, two shells even more likely to be mistaken  for each other than those above-mentioned.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 111    [Illustration]    CYPRAEA tessellata,    _Mosaic Cowry._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        \"_Testa laevigata, ovata, convexa, marginibus involutis, apertura      longitudinalis, angustata, utrinque dentata, ad extremitates effusa.

A few species of Ovula, however, bear a strong  resemblance to the genus, but may be known from not having teeth on each  side the mouth. The Cowries are without exception the most beautiful of all  shells, whether the richness and harmony of their colours, or the exquisite  polish of their exterior, is considered; but (like many other things of  more consequence) their beauty is depreciated by their frequency. The  indefatigable Lamarck has described sixty-six species, only one of which  inhabits the European seas. Adanson has furnished a minute account of the  structure of the animal, and Bruguiere has given long and interesting  details of its economy.    Mrs. Mawe is in possession of this very beautiful little shell; a string of  them were presented her as coming from New Zealand: that which formed the  centre was the only perfect specimen, and from that the figures were taken.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 112    [Illustration]    CONUS carinatus,    _Carinated Cone._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 65.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _C. testa sub-cylindracea, carinata, fulva; spirae depressae, concavae,      maculatae, apice acuto, anfractibus valde concavis, striis numerosis      subgranosis insculptis; basi obtusa, striata, cingulo gibbo      circumdata_.

I believe it to be hitherto  unfigured, and unknown to any writer; for I cannot reconcile it with any of  Lamarck's descriptions of species not yet represented.    I know of no other specimen than the very fine one in Mr. Dubois' cabinet.  The shell is heavy; the body whorl contracted at the upper part, where the  margin is sharply carinated; the spire much depressed and concave; each  volution is also concave, and has from three to four fine grooves, which  occupy its full extent, and which appear minutely granulated; but this is  only caused by the longitudinal lines of growth: the tip of the spire  acute; the base is wider in circumference than usual, with a gibbous belt  marked by elevated striae, in other respects the shell is smooth; the base  of the aperture is effuse, the bands on the body whorl pale and not well  defined, and the spire slightly spotted. It is doubtless an inhabitant of  the Asiatic ocean.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 113    [Illustration]    MITRA pertusa. var.    _Cardinal Mitre_--_large spotted variety_.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 23.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _M. sect. 3.

Shell ovate-acute, white, with transverse punctured striae; the      basal whorl thick, with numerous bands consisting of small, and two of      large tessellated spots; outer lip toothed.           *       *       *       *       *    Much uncertainty exists respecting the shell which Linnaeus intended for  his _Voluta pertusa_, owing to the inaccuracy of the synonyms, which refer  to species widely different from each other; the majority of authors have,  however, considered it to be the shell figured by Born and Martini, under  that name, and recently by myself in _Exotic Conchology_. As a species, it  is principally distinguished by the rows of irregular brown spots which are  always disposed in transverse bands, running into larger blotches adjoining  the suture, and near the base of the body whorl, which is thick and obtuse;  the lesser spots are mostly tessellated or quadrangular, but in size they  vary considerably in different individuals, and even in the same shell;  this has induced Lamarck to separate them into two species, but which, for  reasons to be hereafter given, appears to me unnecessary.    The variety here figured is very rare, nor have I seen more than two  examples; it differs only from the usual varieties in having the spots  remarkably large. In a future plate this species will be further  illustrated, and the correct synonyms of all the varieties then given.  Inhabits various parts of the Asiatic ocean.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 114    [Illustration]    CONUS pulchellus,    _Orange Admiral Cone._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 65.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _C. testa aurantiaca, fasciis albis interruptis ornata; spirae      subdepressae, anfractibus suturam juxta simpliciter sulcatis; sutura      alveata; basi granosa, purpurea._        Shell orange, with two interrupted white bands; spire slightly      depressed,"]]]
