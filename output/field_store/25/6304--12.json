The butter and sugar of milk are given out in the form of carbonic  acid and water, and their conversion into oxidised products  furnishes the clearest proof that far more oxygen is absorbed than  is required to convert the carbon and hydrogen of the metamorphosed  tissues into carbonic acid and water.    The change and metamorphosis of organised tissues going on in the  vital process in the young animal, consequently yield, in a given  time, much less carbon and hydrogen in the form adapted for the  respiratory process than correspond to the oxygen taken up in the  lungs. The substance of its organised parts would undergo a more  rapid consumption, and would necessarily yield to the action of the  oxygen, were not the deficiency of carbon and hydrogen supplied from  another source.    The continued increase of mass, or growth, and the free and  unimpeded development of the organs in the young animal, are  dependent on the presence of foreign substances, which, in the  nutritive process, have no other function than to protect the  newly-formed organs from the action of the oxygen. The elements of  these substances unite with the oxygen; the organs themselves could  not do so without being consumed; that is, growth, or increase of  mass in the body,--the consumption of oxygen remaining the  same,--would be utterly impossible.    The preceding considerations leave no doubt as to the purpose for  which Nature has added to the food of the young of carnivorous  mammalia substances devoid of nitrogen, which their organism cannot  employ for nutrition, strictly so called, that is, for the  production of blood; substances which may be entirely dispensed with  in their nourishment in the adult state. In the young of carnivorous  birds, the want of all motion is an obvious cause of diminished  waste in the organised parts; hence, milk is not provided for them.    The nutritive process in the carnivora thus presents itself under  two distinct forms; one of which we again meet with in the  graminivora.    In graminivorous animals, we observe, that during their whole life,  their existence depends on a supply of substances having a  composition identical with that of sugar of milk, or closely  resembling it. Everything that they consume as food contains a  certain quantity of starch, gum, or sugar, mixed with other matters.    The function performed in the vital process of the graminivora by  these substances is indicated in a very clear and convincing manner,  when we take into consideration the very small relative amount of  the carbon which these animals consume in the nitrogenised  constituents of their food, which bears no proportion whatever to  the oxygen absorbed through the skin and lungs.    A horse, for example, can be kept in perfectly good condition, if he  obtain as food 15 lbs. of hay and 4 1/2 lbs. of oats daily. If we  now calculate the whole amount of nitrogen in these matters, as  ascertained by analysis (1 1/2 per cent. in the hay, 2.2 per cent.  in the oats), in the form of blood, that is, as fibrine and albumen,  with the due proportion of water in blood (80 per cent.), the horse  receives daily no more than 4 1/2 oz. of nitrogen, corresponding to  about 8 lbs. of blood. But along with this nitrogen, that is,  combined with it in the form of fibrine or albumen, the animal  receives only about 14 1/2 oz. of carbon.    Without going further into the calculation, it will readily be  admitted, that the volume of air inspired and expired by a horse,  the quantity of oxygen consumed, and, as a necessary consequence,  the amount of carbonic acid given out by the animal, are much  greater than in the respiratory process in man. But an adult man  consumes daily abut 14 oz. of carbon, and the determination of  Boussingault, according to which a horse expires 79 oz. daily,  cannot be very far from the truth.    In the nitrogenised constituents of his food, therefore, the horse  receives rather less than the fifth part of the carbon which his  organism requires for the support of the respiratory process; and we  see that the wisdom of the Creator has added to his food the  four-fifths which are wanting, in various forms, as starch, sugar,  &c. with which the animal must be supplied, or his organism will be  destroyed by the action of the oxygen.    It is obvious, that in the system of the graminivora, whose food  contains so small a portion, relatively, of the constituents of the  blood, the process of metamorphosis in existing tissues, and  consequently their restoration or reproduction, must go on far less  rapidly than in the carnivora. Were this not the case, a vegetation  a thousand times more luxuriant than the actual one would not  suffice for their nourishment. Sugar, gum, and starch, would no  longer be necessary to support life in these animals, because, in  that case, the products of the waste, or metamorphosis of the  organised tissues, would contain enough carbon to support the  respiratory process.          LETTER X      My dear Sir,    Let me now apply the principles announced in the preceding letters  to the circumstances of our own species. Man, when confined to  animal food, requires for his support and nourishment extensive  sources of food, even more widely extended than the lion and tiger,  because, when he has the opportunity, he kills without eating.    A nation of hunters, on a limited space, is utterly incapable of  increasing its numbers beyond a certain point, which is soon  attained. The carbon necessary for respiration must be obtained from  the animals, of which only a limited number can live on the space  supposed. These animals collect from plants the constituents of  their organs and of their blood, and yield them, in turn, to the  savages who live by the chase alone. They, again, receive this food  unaccompanied by those compounds, destitute of nitrogen, which,  during the life of the animals, served to support the respiratory  process. In such men, confined to an animal diet, it is the carbon  of the flesh and of the blood which must take the place of starch  and sugar.    But 15 lbs. of flesh contain no more carbon than 4 lbs. of starch,  and while the savage with one animal and an equal weight of starch  should maintain life and health for a certain number of days, he  would be compelled, if confined to flesh alone, in order to procure  the carbon necessary for respiration, during the same time, to  consume five such animals.    It is easy to see, from these considerations, how close the  connection is between agriculture and the multiplication of the  human species. The cultivation of our crops has ultimately no other  object than the production of a maximum of those substances which  are adapted for assimilation and respiration, in the smallest  possible space. Grain and other nutritious vegetables yield us, not  only in starch, sugar, and gum, the carbon which protects our organs  from the action of oxygen, and produces in the organism the heat  which is essential to life, but also in the form of vegetable  fibrine, albumen, and caseine, our blood, from which the other parts  of our body are developed.    Man, when confined to animal food, respires, like the carnivora, at  the expense of the matters produced by the metamorphosis of  organised tissues; and, just as the lion, tiger, hyaena, in the  cages of a menagerie, are compelled to accelerate the waste of the  organised tissues by incessant motion, in order to furnish the  matter necessary for respiration, so, the savage, for the very same  object, is forced to make the most laborious exertions, and go  through a vast amount of muscular exercise. He is compelled to  consume force merely in order to supply matter for respiration.    Cultivation is the economy of force. Science teaches us the simplest  means of obtaining the greatest effect with the smallest expenditure  of power, and with given means to produce a maximum of force. The  unprofitable exertion of power, the waste of force in agriculture,  in other branches of industry, in science, or in social economy, is  characteristic of the savage state, or of the want of knowledge.    In accordance with what I have already stated, you will perceive  that the substances of which the food of man is composed may be  divided into two classes; into nitrogenised and non-nitrogenised.  The former are capable of conversion into blood; the latter are  incapable of this transformation.    Out of those substances which are adapted to the formation of blood,  are formed all the organised tissues. The other class of substances,  in the normal state of health, serve to support the process of  respiration. The former may be called the plastic elements of  nutrition; the latter, elements of respiration.    Among the former we reckon--      Vegetable fibrine.    Vegetable albumen.    Vegetable caseine.    Animal flesh.    Animal blood.    Among the elements of respiration in our food, are--      Fat. Pectine.    Starch. Bassorine.    Gum. Wine.    Cane sugar. Beer.    Grape sugar. Spirits.    Sugar of milk.    The most recent and exact researches have established as a universal  fact, to which nothing yet known is opposed, that the nitrogenised  constituents of vegetable food have a composition identical with  that of the constituents of the blood.    No nitrogenised compound, the composition of which differs from that  of fibrine, albumen, and caseine, is capable of supporting the vital  process in animals.    The animal organism unquestionably possesses the power of forming,  from the constituents of its blood, the substance of its membranes  and cellular tissue, of the nerves and brain, and of the organic  part of cartilages and bones. But the blood must be supplied to it  perfect in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#13)"],[1,"in the name of Jesus Christ,  and they shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.    \"I feel an anxious desire to deliver this testimony. I feel the word of  the Lord like fire in my bones and am desirous to have an opportunity  of proclaiming to you those blessings that you are looking for, that  you may rejoice with us in those glorious things which God has revealed  for the salvation of the world in the last days.\"    This speech filled many with exceeding great rejoicing, some even wept  for joy, while others were equally filled with zealous rage. The class  so affected demanded to know if they were not Mormons. \"No,\" replied  Elder Taylor, \"we belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, called by our enemies the 'Mormon Church.'\"    When this was known some said they had heard an unfavorable opinion of  that people. Others said that their pastor, Mr. Matthews, had declared  the thing was from hell, etc.; and in answer to the application for the  chapel to preach in, an unfavorable reply was made.    In the afternoon Elder Taylor and companion attended a meeting of the  non-communion Baptists. The brethren made themselves known to the  leader of the meeting and asked for the use of the house, telling him  he might make collections and keep the money for his society if he  would grant them the privilege of speaking. He excused himself on the  grounds that the Baptist society was so rigid that they would refuse to  hear; but he treated them very kindly.    In the evening they again attended service at Mr. Matthews' chapel.  \"There are many who will become Saints among them,\" predicted Elder  Taylor, \"but they, like others, are sadly under the influence of  priests.\" That night after meeting one of the preachers of the society,  of the name of William Mitchell, came to Elder Taylor and invited him  to his home, and during the next week opened his house for him to hold  meetings in. And notwithstanding all the efforts on the part of Mr.  Matthews' preachers and class-leaders to prevent their members from  going, the house was filled. At the first meeting Mr. Mitchell and his  wife expressed their determination to receive the message, and others  soon followed. A hall in Preston Street was taken, capable of seating  about three hundred, and the first night it was well filled.    Elder Taylor's text was from Jude:    \"It was needful for me to * * * exhort you, that ye should earnestly  contend for the faith which was delivered to the Saints.\"    He referred to the laudable efforts of such reformers as Luther,  Melancthon, Calvin, Wesley, Whitfield and others who had tried to bring  about the ancient order of things, but by reference to the gospel  as contained in the New Testament, showed that they had failed to  accomplish it. This was followed up by an account of how the gospel  had been restored to the earth in the present age by the ministration  of angels and the revelations of God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. He  showed them how what they had been praying for was now accomplished,  and exhorted them to receive it.    The effect of his discourse was overwhelming. Exclamations of praise  and thanksgiving were heard in various parts of the house, while the  weeping of others testified to the emotion they could not otherwise  express. Ten offered themselves for baptism at the close of the  meeting, and many others expressed a friendly disposition.    Meantime the news had reached Mr. Matthews that his sheepfold had  been invaded by the \"Mormons,\" and he wrote back a letter warning his  flock against \"Mormonism,\" but to no purpose. The ten were baptized,  among them Mr. Mitchell, and a great many who attended to witness the  ceremony of baptism expressed a desire to obey the message the next  time a day was appointed for baptisms. Thus the work was begun in  Liverpool.

LABORS CONTINUED IN LIVERPOOL--MANNER OF MEETING  OPPOSITION--INTRODUCTION OF THE GOSPEL INTO IRELAND--A PROPHECY--FIRST  BAPTISM--VISIT TO SCOTLAND--LOVE OF THE SAINTS.    Elder Taylor continued calling upon ministers and other gentlemen  in Liverpool, bearing testimony to them of the restoration of the  gospel. For this purpose he called upon an aged Methodist minister who  accompanied Doctor Coke in some of his missionary tours, and who was  with him when he died.    The conversation with him was very pleasant, but he did not receive the  message of the gospel. He inquired if his visitor intended calling upon  all the ministers in the city, to which the Elder replied that it was  his determination to deliver the message he had been commissioned with;  he had called upon some ministers and intended to see others; and if  there was liberality enough among the Methodists or other denominations  to open their chapels, he would preach. To this the minister replied  that he thought the doctrines Elder Taylor had to advocate would not  agree with theirs, and that he would have to do as the venerable  founder of Methodism had done--go into the highways and the fields.    \"But when Paul, the despised Christian, went into the synagogues of  the Jews, bigoted and fallen as they were,\" replied the Elder, \"they  said to him and his companions, 'Brethren, if ye have any word of  exhortation for the people, say on.\"    \"That is what I say,\" answered the Methodist, \"say on.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Elder Taylor, \"but this is not in your synagogue, sir.\"    To this gentle hint he could only say that he thought the trustees  would not consent to it. In parting, he shook the Elder by the hand and  wished him God-speed.    Elder Taylor also called upon Mr. Radcliff, agent for the Bible Society  and superintendent of the School of Arts. In a conversation lasting  over of three hours, that gentleman made many admissions relative to  the condition of the religious world, which, when his visitor began to  make use of them to show the necessity of a re-opening of the heavens  and a restoration of the ancient gospel, he stopped alarmed, and  observed that \"Mormonism led to tremendous conclusions!\"    \"I am aware that it does,\" quietly replied his visitor, \"but the words  I have used are not mine, but the words of God.\"    There was present at this interview a Miss Brannan, from the Isle of  Man, who expressed a fear of Elder Taylor's religion; and who, as  the conversation drew to a close, ventured to censure him because he  condemned others.    \"No, he does not,\" said Mr. Radcliff, \"he only says they have been  wrong ignorantly, and that they have doubtless lived up to the best  light they had.\"    Miss Brannan did not relish this remark, and relapsed into silence.    Before leaving them, Elder Taylor remarked to her that he was thinking  of going to the Isle of Man, and he would be pleased to call upon her.  She would be glad to see him, but not as a religious teacher. Or if  he was like other preachers, she would be pleased to receive him. To  this the Elder replied that he should visit the Isle of Man whether she  desired him to or not; that there were others there who would receive  the gospel if she rejected it, and as to the matter of being like other  ministers, it reminded him of the story of the Prophet Micah, who was  told to speak as the other prophets of king Ahab had spoken, and it  would be well with him; but Micah replied: \"As the Lord liveth, even  what my God saith, that will I speak.\" So, likewise, he could only  declare that which God had revealed; if that came in conflict with the  doctrines and practices of men, so much the worse for their doctrines  and practices.    In this manner Elder Taylor continued to labor day after day, neither  avoiding the poor and lowly nor shunning the high and the learned.  Conscious that he possessed the truth, he fearlessly came in contact  with all sorts and conditions of men; and so gentlemanly and pleasing  was his bearing that it compelled men to listen to the message he  delivered with respectful attention.    On the 6th of April, 1840, Apostles Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball,  Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, George A. Smith and Elder Reuben Hedlock  arrived in Liverpool, from America. The next day they found Elder  Taylor, who was overjoyed to see them. In a few days they repaired  to Preston and held a council--seven of the quorum of Apostles being  present.    The first business of the council was to ordain Willard Richards an  Apostle, and receive him into the quorum. This addition made eight  Apostles in the council. Brigham Young presided; Elder Taylor was made  clerk. The former was also sustained as the President of the Twelve  Apostles, he being next in seniority of ordination to Thomas B. Marsh,  the former President, who apostatized in Missouri.    It was resolved that a periodical should be published and called the  _Latter-day Saints' Millennial Star_, of which Parley P. Pratt was  appointed editor. A hymn book was also to be published, John Taylor  being one of a committee of three to select the hymns. It was also  decided to print an edition of the Book of Mormon.    In appointing the several Apostles to fields of labor, it was decided  that Elder Taylor continue to preach in Liverpool and vicinity.    On his return to that city, the work spread more rapidly than before  the council at Preston. Opportunities for preaching were plentiful,  and baptisms frequent. In May he called those who had been baptized  together, and ordained a number of the brethren Priests and Elders,  which gave them the right to preach the gospel and to administer the  ordinances thereof. These brethren, filled with zeal, went out into  the public parks, to the commons, the fields and even "]]]
