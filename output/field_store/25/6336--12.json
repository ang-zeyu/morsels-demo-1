Or, to slightly  paraphrase an utterance in Mr. Wilson's preface, if the writer now  and again has to divine certain things that do not show--yet must  be--surely this must not be less than truth. For a writer of \"purpose  fiction\" to do other than this is to make himself as much liable to  censure as the historian who would pervert the truth which he is in  honor bound to state whether it fits in with his personal theories or  not. In his preface, Mr. Wilson informs us that he designed to make  a tale from his observations of western life in Salt Lake and Utah;  but in his search for things on which to found his fiction he was so  dismayed by facts so much more thrilling than any fiction he might have  imagined, that he turned from his first purpose in order \"to try to  tell what had really been.\" \"In this story then,\" says he, \"the things  that are strangest have most truth. The make-believe is hardly more  than a cement to join the queerly wrought stones of fact that were  found ready.\" Hence we are to be turned from considering his work as  fiction in order to regard it as truth.    It is exactly at this point that I arraign Mr. Wilson before the bar of  public opinion, and tell him that what he represents as true I denounce  as false; and this quite apart from any books from which he has  paraphrased much of the matter he weaves into his story. The trouble  is that the sources whence he makes his deductions are as untrue in  their statements as his paraphrases of them are. Mr. Wilson is as one  who walks through some splendid orchard and gathers here and there  the worm-eaten, frost-bitten, wind-blasted, growth-stunted and rotten  fruit, which in spite of the best of care is to be found in every  orchard; bringing this to us he says: \"This is the fruit of yonder  orchard; you see how worthless it is; an orchard growing such fruit is  ready for the burning.\" Whereas, the fact may be that there are tons  and tons of beautiful, luscious fruit, as pleasing to the eye as it  would be agreeable to the palate, remaining in the orchard to which he  does not call our attention at all. Would not such a representation of  the orchard be an untruth, notwithstanding his blighted specimens were  gathered from its trees? If he presents to us the blighted specimens  of fruit from the orchard, is he not in truth and in honor bound also  to call our attention to the rich harvest of splendid fruit that  still remains ungathered before he asks us to pass judgement on the  orchard? I am not so blind in my admiration of the Mormon people, or  so bigoted in my devotion to the Mormon faith as to think that there  are no individuals in that Church chargeable with fanaticism, folly,  intemperate speech and wickedness; nor am I blind to the fact that  some in their over-zeal have lacked judgement; and that in times of  excitement, under stress of special provocation, even Mormon leaders  have given utterance to ideas that are indefensible. But I have yet to  learn that it is just in a writer of history or of \"purpose fiction,\"  that \"must speak truly,\" to make a collection of these things and  represent them as of the essence of that faith against which said  writer draws an indictment.    \"No one would measure the belief of Christians,\" says a truly great  writer, \"by certain statements in the Fathers, nor judge the moral  principles of Roman Catholics by prurient quotations from the casuists;  nor yet estimate Lutherans by the utterances and deeds of the early  successors of Luther, nor Calvanists by the burning of Servitus. In  such cases the general standpoint of the times has to taken into  account.\" (Edeshiem's Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, preface,  page 8.)    A long time ago the great Edmund Burke, in his defense of the rashness  expressed in both speech and action some of our patriots of the  American Revolution period, said: \"It is not fair to judge of the  temper or the disposition of any man or set of men when they are  composed and at rest from their conduct or their expressions in a  state of disturbance and irritation.\" The justice of Burke's assertion  has never been questioned, and without any wresting whatsoever it may  be applied to Mormon leaders who sometimes spoke and acted under the  recollection of rank injustice perpetrated against themselves and their  people; or rebuke rising evils against which their souls revolted.    Mr. Wilson's book is a false indictment against Mormonism, and  against the leading characters of the Mormon Church. The speeches he  represents as falling from their lips, could never be recognized in  the utterances of Mormons, either among the leaders, or the rank and  file. The blasphemous phraseology was never heard in Mormon camps or  pulpits. Such expressions as \"When that young man gets all het up with  the Holy Ghost, the angel of the Lord just has to give down;\" or \"Lord,  what won't Brother Brigham do when the Holy Ghost gets a strangle-holt  on him?\" are blasphemies utterly impossible to the Mormon mind. Such  expressions as the following, represented as coming from Brigham Young:  \"The Lute of the Holy Ghost will now say a word of farewell from our  pioneers to those who must stay behind,\" is equally impossible; and  so are many other speeches which he puts into the mouths of leading  characters of the Mormon Church. Even this blasphemous phrase-name  given to Joel Rae--\"Lute of the Holy Ghost\"--is not original with Mr.  Wilson. It was a cognomen given to Ephraem Syrus, \"the greatest man,\"  says Andrew D. White, author of \"A History of the Warfare of Science  with Theology in Christendom,\"--\"the greatest man of the old Syrian  Church, widely known as the 'Lute of the Holy Ghost.'\" [A]    [Footnote A: Vol. I, p. 92 of work named in text.]    The most serious injustice Mr. Wilson does the Mormon people, however,  the thing in which he most departs from the facts established, not  only by history but by the decisions of the United States courts in  Utah, is in that he makes the awful crime of the massacre of emigrants  at Mountain Meadows, in 1857, the crime of the Mormon Church. Over  and over again in fact he makes that charge, and represents his chief  character, \"Joel Rae,\" as seeking to take upon himself the sins of the  \"Church\" for committing that crime; and in one place represents him as  saying: \"For fifteen years I have lain in hell for the work this Church  did at Mountain Meadows.\" To bear false witness against one's neighbor  even in matters that may be trivial, is a contemptible crime; but  when in bearing false witness the charge is that of murder, wholesale  murder, and that under circumstances the most revolting and horrible,  the crime then of bearing false witness rises above the merely  contemptible, and to be seen in its true enormity, must be regarded as  bearing a due proportion to the crime charged. That is, next to being  guilty of the crime itself must be the crime of falsely charging it  to the innocent. I care nothing for the fact that the predecessors of  Mr. Wilson, in works of fiction on the West have made similar charges.  He will not be justified in following their evil example. A man of  his standing in the world of letters, starting out to \"try to tell  what had really been,\" to write fiction that must speak \"no less than  truth\"--he was under obligations both to himself and the people to whom  his message should go, to investigate all the facts, and speak truly in  harmony with them in every case.    It is not necessary here to enter into any argument or even produce  the evidence that the Mormon Church was in no wise responsible, in  no wise connected with the awful butchery at Mountain Meadows. The  evidence of these things appear upon the very surface of our history  in Utah, and also in decisions of United States judges who would only  have been too happy to have implicated the Mormon Church officials  in that awful crime if it had been possible. In fact they tried to  so fix the responsibility, and failed. But it is enough here to tell  Mr. Wilson, that he has Committed an act of injustice for which I  would not like to stand responsible at the judgement bar of God; I am  confident that he will be driven to the necessity of choosing between  these alternatives: either that he has consciously spoken contrary to  truth in the matter; or else he has given merely surface consideration  to one side of the subject only which he represents himself as having  considered profoundly; in either event Mr. Wilson has assumed a most  serious responsibility.        IV.    A BRIEF DEFENSE OF THE MORMON PEOPLE.    FOREWORD.    In the year 1903, Mr. L. C. Bateman, one of the editors of the  \"Lewiston (Maine) Journal\" visited Salt Lake City and other parts  of Utah. He formed a favorable impression of the Mormon people, and  their progress in all that makes for civilization. The result of his  observations while in Utah Mr. Bateman published in his paper, the  \"Lewiston (Maine) Journal.\" This article attracted the attention of  the _Deseret News_, which made some favorable comment upon its general  fairness. Observing this, a non-Mormon resident of Salt Lake City wrote  the \"Journal,\" protesting against the letter published by its editorial  staff correspondent, saying that such treatment of the \"Mormon  question\" was harmful in that it gave encouragement to Mormonism. The  communication of \"M\" was sent to this writer--who met Mr. Bateman,  during his visit to Utah--with the request that he make answer to it,  which he did under the title \"A Brief Defense of the Mormon People,\"  which was published in the \"Journal.\" Of the success of this answer Mr.  Bateman, the editor of the \"Journal,\" wrote as follows:    LEWISTON, MAINE, Oct. 4, 1903.    _My Dear Mr. Roberts:_    Permit me to congratulate you on the magnificent and overwhelming reply  that you made to my critic \"M.\" from Salt Lake. It is one "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4776"],[0,"Political Ideals (#13)"],[1,"is reasonable to hope that if ever an international  government, possessed of the only army and navy in the world, came  into existence, the need of force to enact obedience to its decisions  would be very temporary.  In a short time the benefits resulting from  the substitution of law for anarchy would become so obvious that the  international government would acquire an unquestioned authority, and  no state would dream of rebelling against its decisions.  As soon as  this stage had been reached, the international army and navy would  become unnecessary.    We have still a very long road to travel before we arrive at the  establishment of an international authority, but it is not very  difficult to foresee the steps by which this result will be gradually  reached.  There is likely to be a continual increase in the practice  of submitting disputes to arbitration, and in the realization that the  supposed conflicts of interest between different states are mainly  illusory.  Even where there is a real conflict of interest, it must in  time become obvious that neither of the states concerned would suffer  as much by giving way as by fighting.  With the progress of  inventions, war, when it does occur, is bound to become increasingly  destructive.  The civilized races of the world are faced with the  alternative of cooperation or mutual destruction.  The present war  is making this alternative daily more evident.  And it is difficult to  believe that, when the enmities which it has generated have had time  to cool, civilized men will deliberately choose to destroy  civilization, rather than acquiesce in the abolition of war.    The matters in which the interests of nations are supposed to clash  are mainly three: tariffs, which are a delusion; the exploitation of  inferior races, which is a crime; pride of power and dominion, which  is a schoolboy folly.    The economic argument against tariffs is familiar, and I shall not  repeat it.  The only reason why it fails to carry conviction is the  enmity between nations.  Nobody proposes to set up a tariff between  England and Scotland, or between Lancashire and Yorkshire.  Yet the  arguments by which tariffs between nations are supported might be used  just as well to defend tariffs between counties.  Universal free trade  would indubitably be of economic benefit to mankind, and would be  adopted to-morrow if it were not for the hatred and suspicion which  nations feel one toward another.  From the point of view of preserving  the peace of the world, free trade between the different civilized  states is not so important as the open door in their dependencies.  The desire for exclusive markets is one of the most potent causes of  war.    Exploiting what are called \"inferior races\" has become one of the main  objects of European statecraft.  It is not only, or primarily, trade  that is desired, but opportunities for investment; finance is more  concerned in the matter than industry.  Rival diplomatists are very  often the servants, conscious or unconscious, of rival groups of  financiers.  The financiers, though themselves of no particular  nation, understand the art of appealing to national prejudice, and of  inducing the taxpayer to incur expenditure of which they reap the  benefit.  The evils which they produce at home, and the devastation  that they spread among the races whom they exploit, are part of the  price which the world has to pay for its acquiescence in the  capitalist regime.    But neither tariffs nor financiers would be able to cause serious  trouble, if it were not for the sentiment of national pride.  National  pride might be on the whole beneficent, if it took the direction of  emulation in the things that are important to civilization.  If we  prided ourselves upon our poets, our men of science, or the justice  and humanity of our social system, we might find in national pride a  stimulus to useful endeavors.  But such matters play a very small  part.  National pride, as it exists now, is almost exclusively  concerned with power and dominion, with the extent of territory that a  nation owns, and with its capacity for enforcing its will against the  opposition of other nations.  In this it is reinforced by group  morality.  To nine citizens out of ten it seems self-evident, whenever  the will of their own nation clashes with that of another, that their  own nation must be in the right.  Even if it were not in the right on  the particular issue, yet it stands in general for so much nobler  ideals than those represented by the other nation to the dispute, that  any increase in its power is bound to be for the good of mankind.  Since all nations equally believe this of themselves, all are equally  ready to insist upon the victory of their own side in any dispute in  which they believe that they have a good hope of victory.  While this  temper persists, the hope of international cooperation must remain  dim.    If men could divest themselves of the sentiment of rivalry and  hostility between different nations, they would perceive that the  matters in which the interests of different nations coincide  immeasurably outweigh those in which they clash; they would perceive,  to begin with, that trade is not to be compared to warfare; that the  man who sells you goods is not doing you an injury.  No one considers  that the butcher and the baker are his enemies because they drain him  of money.  Yet as soon as goods come from a foreign country, we are  asked to believe that we suffer a terrible injury in purchasing them.  No one remembers that it is by means of goods exported that we  purchase them.  But in the country to which we export, it is the goods  we send which are thought dangerous, and the goods we buy are  forgotten.  The whole conception of trade, which has been forced upon  us by manufacturers who dreaded foreign competition, by trusts which  desired to secure monopolies, and by economists poisoned by the virus  of nationalism, is totally and absolutely false.  Trade results simply  from division of labor.  A man cannot himself make all the goods of  which he has need, and therefore he must exchange his produce with  that of other people.  What applies to the individual, applies in  exactly the same way to the nation.  There is no reason to desire that  a nation should itself produce all the goods of which it has need; it  is better that it should specialize upon those goods which it can  produce to most advantage, and should exchange its surplus with the  surplus of other goods produced by other countries.  There is no use  in sending goods out of the country except in order to get other goods  in return.  A butcher who is always willing to part with his meat but  not willing to take bread from the baker, or boots from the bootmaker,  or clothes from the tailor, would soon find himself in a sorry plight.  Yet he would be no more foolish than the protectionist who desires  that we should send goods abroad without receiving payment in the  shape of goods imported from abroad.    The wage system has made people believe that what a man needs is work.  This, of course, is absurd.  What he needs is the goods produced by  work, and the less work involved in making a given amount of goods,  the better.  But owing to our economic system, every economy in  methods of production enables employers to dismiss some of their  employees, and to cause destitution, where a better system would  produce only an increase of wages or a diminution in the hours of work  without any corresponding diminution of wages.    Our economic system is topsyturvy.  It makes the interest of the  individual conflict with the interest of the community in a thousand  ways in which no such conflict ought to exist.  Under a better system  the benefits of free trade and the evils of tariffs would be obvious  to all.    Apart from trade, the interests of nations coincide in all that makes  what we call civilization.  Inventions and discoveries bring benefit  to all.  The progress of science is a matter of equal concern to the  whole civilized world.  Whether a man of science is an Englishman, a  Frenchman, or a German is a matter of no real importance.  His  discoveries are open to all, and nothing but intelligence is required  in order to profit by them.  The whole world of art and literature and  learning is international; what is done in one country is not done for  that country, but for mankind.  If we ask ourselves what are the  things that raise mankind above the brutes, what are the things that  make us think the human race more valuable than any species of  animals, we shall find that none of them are things in which any one  nation can have exclusive property, but all are things in which the  whole world can share.  Those who have any care for these things,  those who wish to see mankind fruitful in the work which men alone can  do, will take little account of national boundaries, and have little  care to what state a man happens to owe allegiance.    The importance of international cooperation outside the sphere of  politics has been brought home to me by my own experience.  Until  lately I was engaged in teaching a new science which few men in the  world were able to teach.  My own work in this science was based  chiefly upon the work of a German and an Italian.  My pupils came from  all over the civilized world: France, Germany, Austria, Russia,  Greece, Japan, China, India, and America.  None of us was conscious of  any sense of national divisions.  We felt ourselves an outpost of  civilization, building a new road into the virgin forest of the  unknown.  All cooperated in the common task, and in the interest of  such a work the political enmities of nations seemed trivial,  temporary, and futile.    But it is not only in the somewhat rarefied atmosphere of abstruse  science that international cooperation is vital to the progress of  civilization.  All our economic"]]]
