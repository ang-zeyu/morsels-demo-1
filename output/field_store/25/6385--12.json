There were many  unpleasant things lying about that  had much better have been buried;  rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens'  legs and other horrors. It was  a shocking place, and very dark.    They went back to the front of  the house, and tried in every way to  move the bolt of the kitchen window.  They tried to push up a rusty  nail between the window sashes;  but it was of no use, especially  without a light.    They sat side by side outside the  window, whispering and listening.    In half an hour the moon rose  over the wood. It shone full and  clear and cold, upon the house,  amongst the rocks, and in at the  kitchen window. But alas, no little  rabbit babies were to be seen! The  moonbeams twinkled on the carving  knife and the pie dish, and  made a path of brightness across  the dirty floor.    The light showed a little door in  a wall beside the kitchen fireplace  --a little iron door belonging to a  brick oven of that old-fashioned  sort that used to be heated with  faggots of wood.    And presently at the same moment  Peter and Benjamin noticed  that whenever they shook the window  the little door opposite shook  in answer. The young family were  alive; shut up in the oven!    Benjamin was so excited that it  was a mercy he did not awake  Tommy Brock, whose snores continued  solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.    But there really was not very  much comfort in the discovery.  They could not open the window;  and although the young family was  alive the little rabbits were quite  incapable of letting themselves out;  they were not old enough to crawl.    After much whispering, Peter  and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel.  They began to burrow a yard  or two lower down the bank. They  hoped that they might be able to  work between the large stones  under the house; the kitchen floor  was so dirty that it was impossible  to say whether it was made of earth  or flags.    They dug and dug for hours.  They could not tunnel straight on  account of stones; but by the end of  the night they were under the  kitchen floor. Benjamin was on his  back scratching upwards. Peter's  claws were worn down; he was  outside the tunnel, shuffling sand  away. He called out that it was  morning--sunrise; and that the  jays were making a noise down  below in the woods.    Benjamin Bunny came out of the  dark tunnel shaking the sand from  his ears; he cleaned his face with  his paws. Every minute the sun  shone warmer on the top of the  hill. In the valley there was a sea of  white mist, with golden tops of  trees showing through.    Again from the fields down  below in the mist there came the  angry cry of a jay, followed by the  sharp yelping bark of a fox!    Then those two rabbits lost their  heads completely. They did the  most foolish thing that they could  have done. They rushed into their  short new tunnel, and hid themselves  at the top end of it, under  Mr. Tod's kitchen floor.    Mr. Tod was coming up Bull  Banks, and he was in the very worst  of tempers. First he had been upset  by breaking the plate. It was his  own fault; but it was a china plate,  the last of the dinner service that  had belonged to his grandmother,  old Vixen Tod. Then the midges  had been very bad. And he had  failed to catch a hen pheasant on  her nest; and it had contained only  five eggs, two of them addled. Mr.  Tod had had an unsatisfactory  night.    As usual, when out of humor, he  determined to move house. First he  tried the pollard willow, but it was  damp; and the otters had left a  dead fish near it. Mr. Tod likes  nobody's leavings but his own.    He made his way up the hill; his  temper was not improved by noticing  unmistakable marks of badger.  No one else grubs up the moss so  wantonly as Tommy Brock.    Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon  the earth and fumed; he guessed  where Tommy Brock had gone to.  He was further annoyed by the jay  bird which followed him persistently.  It flew from tree to tree and  scolded, warning every rabbit  within hearing that either a cat or  a fox was coming up the plantation.  Once when it flew screaming  over his head Mr. Tod snapped at  it, and barked.    He approached his house very  carefully, with a large rusty key. He  sniffed and his whiskers bristled.    The house was locked up, but Mr.  Tod had his doubts whether it was  empty. He turned the rusty key in  the lock; the rabbits below could  hear it. Mr. Tod opened the door  cautiously and went in.    The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes  in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod  furious. There was Mr. Tod's chair,  and Mr. Tod's pie dish, and his  knife and fork and mustard and  salt cellar, and his tablecloth, that  he had left folded up in the dresser  --all set out for supper (or breakfast)  --without doubt for that  odious Tommy Brock.    There was a smell of fresh earth  and dirty badger, which fortunately  overpowered all smell of  rabbit.    But what absorbed Mr. Tod's  attention was a noise, a deep slow  regular snoring grunting noise,  coming from his own bed.    He peeped through the hinges of  the half-open bedroom door. Then  he turned and came out of the  house in a hurry. His whiskers bristled  and his coat collar stood on  end with rage.    For the next twenty minutes Mr.  Tod kept creeping cautiously into  the house, and retreating hurriedly  out again. By degrees he ventured  further in--right into the bed-  room. When he was outside the  house, he scratched up the earth  with fury. But when he was inside  --he did not like the look of  Tommy Brock's teeth.    He was lying on his back with his  mouth open, grinning from ear to  ear. He snored peacefully and  regularly; but one eye was not  perfectly shut.    Mr. Tod came in and out of the  bedroom. Twice he brought in his  walking stick, and once he brought  in the coal scuttle. But he thought  better of it, and took them away.    When he came back after removing  the coal scuttle, Tommy Brock  was lying a little more sideways;  but he seemed even sounder asleep.  He was an incurably indolent person;  he was not in the least afraid  of Mr. Tod; he was simply too lazy  and comfortable to move.    Mr. Tod came back yet again  into the bedroom with a clothes  line. He stood a minute watching  Tommy Brock and listening attentively  to the snores. They were very  loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.    Mr. Tod turned his back towards  the bed, and undid the window. It  creaked; he turned round with a  jump. Tommy Brock, who had  opened one eye--shut it hastily.  The snores continued.    Mr. Tod's proceedings were  peculiar, and rather difficult (because  the bed was between the window  and the door of the bedroom). He  opened the window a little way,  and pushed out the greater part of  the clothes line on to the window-  sill. The rest of the line, with a hook  at the end, remained in his hand.    Tommy Brock snored conscientiously.  Mr. Tod stood and looked  at him for a minute; then he left  the room again.    Tommy Brock opened both eyes,  and looked at the rope and grinned.  There was a noise outside the window.  Tommy Brock shut his eyes in  a hurry.    Mr. Tod had gone out at the  front door, and round to the back  of the house. On the way, he stumbled  over the rabbit burrow. If he  had had any idea who was inside it  he would have pulled them out  quickly.    His foot went through the tunnel  nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit  and Benjamin; but, fortunately, he  thought that it was some more of  Tommy Brock's work.    He took up the coil of line from  the sill, listened for a moment, and  then tied the rope to a tree.    Tommy Brock watched him with  one eye, through the window. He  was puzzled.    Mr. Tod fetched a large heavy  pailful of water from the spring,  and staggered with it through the  kitchen into his bedroom.    Tommy Brock snored industriously,  with rather a snort.    Mr. Tod put down the pail beside  the bed, took up the end of rope  with the hook--hesitated, and  looked at Tommy Brock. The  snores were almost apoplectic; but  the grin was not quite so big.    Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a  chair by the head of the bedstead.  His legs were dangerously near to  Tommy Brock's teeth.    He reached up and put the end  of rope, with the hook, over the  head of the tester bed, where the  curtains ought to hang.    (Mr. Tod's curtains were folded  up, and put away, owing to the  house being unoccupied. So was  the counterpane. Tommy Brock  was covered with a blanket only.)  Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady  chair looked down upon him attentively;  he really was a first prize  sound sleeper!    It seemed as though nothing  would waken him--not even the  flapping rope across the bed.    Mr. Tod descended safely from  the chair, and endeavored to get up  again with the pail of water. He  intended to hang it from the hook,  dangling over the head of Tommy  Brock, in order to make a sort of  shower-bath, worked by a string,  through the window.    But, naturally, being a thin-  legged person (though vindictive  and sandy whiskered)--he was  quite unable to lift the heavy  weight to the level of the hook and  rope. He very nearly overbalanced  himself.    The snores became more and  more apoplectic. One of Tommy  Brock's hind legs twitched under  the blanket, but still he slept on  peacefully.    Mr. Tod and the pail descended  from the chair without accident.  After considerable thought, he  emptied the water into a wash  basin and jug. The empty pail was  not too heavy for him; he slung it  up wobbling over the head of  Tommy Brock.    Surely there never was such a  sleeper! Mr. Tod got up and down,  down and up on the chair.    As he could not lift the whole  pailful of water at once he fetched  a milk jug and ladled quarts of  water into the pail by degrees. The  pail got fuller and fuller, and  swung like a pendulum.

Herbert did not answer, for he understood that his guide was not telling  the truth, and he did not like falsehood or deceit.    They entered the monument and commenced the ascent.    \"We have a tiresome ascent before us,\" said the other.    \"How many steps are there?\" asked Herbert.    \"About three hundred,\" was the reply.    At different points in the ascent they came to landings where they could  catch glimpses of the outward world through long, narrow, perpendicular  slits in the sides of the monument.    At last they reached the top.    Herbert's guide looked about him sharply, and seemed disappointed to  find a lady and gentleman and child also enjoying the view.    Herbert had never been so high before. Indeed, he had never been in any  high building, and he looked about him with a novel sense of enjoyment.    \"What a fine view there is here!\" he said.    \"True,\" assented his companion. \"Let me point out to you the different  towns visible to the naked eye.\"    \"I wish you would,\" said the boy.    So his guide pointed out Cambridge, Chelsea, Malden, the Charles and  Mystic Rivers, gleaming in the sunshine, the glittering dome of the  Boston State House and other conspicuous objects. Herbert felt that it  was worth something to have a companion who could do him this service,  and he felt the extra twenty cents he had paid for his companion's  ticket was a judicious investment.    He noticed with some surprise that his companion seemed annoyed by the  presence of the other party already referred to. He scowled and shrugged  his shoulders when he looked at them, and in a low voice, inaudible to  those of whom he spoke, he said to Herbert: \"Are they going to stay here  all day?\"    \"What does it matter to me if they do?\" returned Herbert, in surprise.    Indeed, to him they seemed very pleasant people, and he was especially  attracted by the sweet face of the little girl. He wished he had been  fortunate enough to possess such a sister.    At last, however, they finished their sightseeing, and prepared to  descend. Herbert's companion waited till the sound of their descending  steps died away, and then, turning to Herbert, said in a quick, stern  tone: \"Now give me the money you have in your pocket.\"    \"What do you mean?\" he said.    Herbert recoiled, and stared at the speaker in undisguised astonishment.    \"I mean just what I say,\" returned the other. \"You have one hundred and  fifty dollars in your pocket. You need not deny it, for I saw you draw  it from the bank and put it away.\"    \"Are you a thief, then?\" demanded Herbert.    \"No matter what I am, I must have that money,\" said the stranger. \"I  came over with you exclusively to get it, and I mean business.\"    He made a step towards Herbert, but the boy faced him unflinchingly, and  answered resolutely: \"I mean business, too. The money is not mine, and I  shall not give it up.\"    \"Take care!\" said the other, menacingly, \"we are alone here. You are a  boy and I am a man.\"    \"I know that; but you will have to fight to get the money,\" said  Herbert, without quailing.    He looked to the staircase, but his treacherous guide stood between him  and it, and he was practically a prisoner at the top of the monument.    \"Don't be a fool!\" said the stranger. \"You may as well give up the money  to me first as last.\"    \"I don't propose to give it up to you at all,\" said Herbert. \"My  employer trusted me with it, and I mean to be true to my trust.\"    \"You can tell him that it was taken from you--that you could not help  yourself. Now hand it over!\"    \"Never!\" exclaimed Herbert, resolutely.    \"We'll see about that,\" said his companion, seizing the boy and  grappling with him.    Herbert was a strong boy for his age, and he accepted the challenge.  Though his antagonist was a man, he found that the boy was powerful, and  not to be mastered as easily as he anticipated.    \"Confound you!\" he muttered, \"I wish I had a knife!\"    Though Herbert made a vigorous resistance, his opponent was his superior  in strength, and would ultimately have got the better of him. He had  thrown Herbert down, and was trying to thrust his hand into his coat  pocket, when a step was heard, and a tall man of Western appearance  stepped on the scene.    \"Hello!\" he said, surveying the two combatants in surprise. \"What's all  this? Let that boy alone, you skunk, you!\"    As he spoke, he seized the man by the collar and jerked him to his feet.    \"What does all this mean?\" he asked, turning from one to the other.    \"This boy has robbed me of one hundred and fifty dollars,\" said the man,  glibly. \"I fell in with him in the Boston cars, and he relieved me of a  roll of bills which I had drawn from a bank in Boston.\"    \"What have you got to say to this?\" asked the Western man, turning to  Herbert, who was now on his feet.    \"Only this,\" answered Herbert, \"that it is a lie. It was I who drew  the money from the Merchants' Bank in Boston. This man saw me cash the  check, followed me, and offered to come here with me, when I asked him  for directions.\"    \"That's a likely story!\" sneered the young man. \"My friend here is too  sharp to believe it.\"    \"Don't call me your friend!\" said the Western man, bluntly. \"I'm more  than half convinced you're a scamp.\"    \"I don't propose to stay here and be insulted. Let the boy give me my  money, and I won't have him arrested.\"    \"Don't be in too much of a hurry, young man! I want to see about this  thing. What bank did you draw the money from?\"    \"From the Merchants' Bank--the boy has got things reversed. He saw me  draw it, inveigled himself into my confidence, and picked my pocket.\"    \"Look here--stop right there! Your story doesn't hang together!\" said  the tall Westerner, holding up his finger. \"You said you met this boy in  a horse car.\"    \"We came over together in a Charlestown horse car,\" said the rogue,  abashed.    \"You've given yourself away. Now make yourself scarce! Scoot!\"    The rascal looked in the face of the tall, resolute man from the  West, and thought it prudent to obey. He started to descend, but a  well-planted kick accelerated his progress, and he fell down several  steps, bruising his knees.    \"Thank you, sir!\" said Herbert, gratefully. \"It was lucky you came up  just as you did. The rascal had got his hand on the money.\"    \"He is a miserable scamp!\" answered Herbert's new friend. \"If there'd  been a police-man handy, I'd have given him in charge. I've come clear  from Wisconsin to see where Warren fell, but I didn't expect to come  across such a critter as that on Bunker Hill.\"    Herbert pointed out to his new friend the objects in view, repeating  the information he had so recently acquired. Then, feeling that he could  spare no more time, he descended the stairs and jumped on board a horse  car bound for Boston.          CHAPTER XVII. AN ACCEPTABLE PRESENT.        As the clock at the Old South Church struck one, Herbert ascended  the steps of Parker's Hotel, and walked into the reading room. George  Melville was already there.    \"You are on time, Herbert,\" he said, with a smile, as our hero made his  appearance.    \"Yes, sir; but I began to think I should miss my appointment.\"    \"Where have you been?\"    \"To Bunker Hill.\"    \"Did you ascend the monument?\"    \"Yes, sir, and had a fight at the summit.\"    Mr. Melville looked at Herbert in amazement.    \"Had a fight at the top of Bunker Hill Monument?\" he ejaculated.    \"Yes, sir; let me tell you about it.\"    When the story was told, Mr. Melville said: \"That was certainly a  remarkable adventure, Herbert. Still, I am not sorry that it occurred.\"    It was Herbert's turn to look surprised.    \"I will tell you why. It proves to me that you are worthy of my  confidence, and can be trusted with the care of money. It has also  taught you a lesson, to beware of knaves, no matter how plausible they  may be.\"    \"I haven't got over my surprise yet, sir, at discovering the real  character of the man who went with me. I am sorry I met him. I don't  like to distrust people.\"    \"Nor I. But it is not necessary to distrust everybody. In your  journey through the world you will make many agreeable and trustworthy  acquaintances in whom it will be safe to confide. It is only necessary  to be cautious and not give your confidence too soon.\"    \"Oh, I didn't mention that I met somebody from Wayneboro,\" said Herbert.    \"Was it Eben Graham?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I met him myself on Washington Street. Did you speak to him?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I suppose he goes back to-night?\"    \"I don't think he will go back at all, Mr. Melville.\"    His employer looked at him inquiringly.    \"I saw him buy a ticket to Chicago, though he does not know it,\"  continued Herbert. \"When he spoke with me he didn't admit it, but spoke  of going back by an afternoon train.\"    \"I am afraid he has appropriated some of his father's funds,\" said  Melville. \"I doubt if Ebenezer Graham would voluntarily furnish him the  means of going West.\"    \"That was just what occurred to me,\" said Herbert; \"but I didn't like to  think that Eben would steal.\"    \"Perhaps he has not. We shall be likely to hear when we return. But you  must be hungry. We will go in to dinner.\"    Herbert followed Mr. Melville into the dining room, where a good dinner  was ordered, and partaken of. Herbert looked over the bill of fare,  but the high prices quite startled him. He was not used to patronizing  hotels, and it seemed to him that the price asked for a single dish  ought to be enough to pay for a whole dinner for two. He knew about what  it cost for a meal at home, and did not dream that it would amount to so  much more at a hotel.    When the check was brought Herbert looked at it.    \"Two dollars and a half!\" he exclaimed.    \"It costs an awful amount to live in Boston.\"    \"Oh a dinner can be got much cheaper at most places in Boston,\" said  George Melville, smiling, \"but I am used to Parker's, and generally come  here.\"    \"I am"]]]
