He began to make what arrangements he  deemed best, in order to establish himself and run things independently  of, and without acknowledging the governor of Manila, without whose  intervention and assistance this enterprise could not be continued.        Of the administration of Don Francisco Tello, and of the second  establishment of the Audiencia of Manila; and of occurrences during  the period of this administration.    CHAPTER SIXTH    Governor Don Luis Dasmariñas was awaiting news from Captain Juan  Xuarez Gallinato, and from Governor Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa  concerning the voyage which each had made at the beginning of the year  ninety-six, to Camboja and to Mindanao, when news reached Manila,  in the month of June, that two ships had entered the islands by the  channel of Espiritu Santo, and that they brought a new governor sent  from España, namely, Don Francisco Tello de Guzman, knight of the Order  of Sanctiago, a native of Sevilla, and treasurer of the India House  of Trade. He arrived at Manila in the beginning of July and entered  upon his office. It was also learned that Fray Ygnacio Sanctivañez,  of the Order of St. Francis, a native of Sanctivañez, in the province  of Burgos, had been nominated in Nueva España as archbishop of Manila,  for Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar had died in Madrid; and that Fray  Miguel de Venavides, a native of Carrion and a religious of the Order  of St. Dominic, who had gone to España with Bishop Fray Domingo de  Salazar, had been appointed bishop of the city of Segovia in the  province of Cagayan; also that Fray Pedro de Agurto, of the Order  of St. Augustine, a native of Mexico, had been appointed in Mexico,  bishop of the city of Sanctisimo Nombre de Jesus, and that these  two bishops with another for the city of Caceres, in the province  of Camarines, who was not yet named, had been lately added to the  Filipinas and appointed as suffragans to the archbishop of Manila,  at the instance of Bishop Fray Domingo. Also it was learned that the  Audiencia which had been suppressed in Manila was to be reëstablished  there, as well as other things which the bishop had presented at court.    Shortly after Don Francisco Tello had taken over the governorship, news  was brought of the death of Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa in Mindanao,  by Brother Gaspar Gomez of the Society of Jesus. The latter brought  the body for burial in the college of Manila, of which Don Estevan  was patron. Juan de la Xara wrote that he had charge of affairs,  that he had settled in Tampacan, that he intended to continue the  pacification and conquest of the island as should seem most advisable,  and that reënforcements of men and other things should be sent him. It  was learned that he intended to make an ill use of the government,  and would not remain dependent on, and subordinate to, the governor  of the Filipinas; and that he was depriving the heirs of Estevan  Rodriguez of what lawfully belonged to them. It was learned that,  in order to make himself safer in this respect, he was sending his  confidants to the town of Arevalo in Oton where Don Estevan had  left his wife, Doña Ana de Osseguera, and his two small daughters,  with his house and property, to persuade Doña Ana to marry him. This  resolution appeared injurious in many respects, and the attempt was  made to rectify matters. But in order not to disturb the affairs  of Mindanao, the matter was left alone for the present, until time  should show the course to be followed. And so it happened that when  Juan de la Xara left the camp and settlements of Mindanao, and came  hurriedly to Oton to negotiate his marriage in person--although the  widow of Don Estevan had never been favorable to it--Don Francisco  Tello sent men to arrest him. He was brought to Manila, where he died  while his trial was being conducted.    After the imprisonment of Juan de La Xara, Don Francisco Tello  immediately sent Captain Toribio de Miranda to Mindanao, with orders  to take command of the camp and to govern, until some one should  agree to continue the enterprise. When he arrived at Mindanao and the  soldiers saw that Juan de La Xara's schemes had been defeated, and  that the latter was a prisoner in Manila, with no hope of returning,  they obeyed Toribio de Miranda and the orders that he brought.    In Manila the governor was considering carefully the necessary  measures for continuing the war, since the island of Mindanao was so  near the other pacified islands, and the island itself contained some  provinces that professed peace and were apportioned as encomiendas,  and had Spanish magistrates, such as the rivers of Butuan, Dapitan,  and Caragan, so that it was desirable to pacify the whole island and  subject it to his Majesty. The royal treasury was spent and could  not bear the expense; and Estevan Rodriguez had bound himself by a  legal writ, to carry the war to entire completion at his own expense,  in accordance with the terms of his agreement. The guardian of his  children and heirs brought the matter before the court, and refused  to fulfil this obligation on account of Estevan Rodriguez's death. In  order not to lose time, for what had been commenced had to be continued  in one way or another, the governor decided to prosecute it, drawing  the necessary funds from the royal treasury, either on its own account  or on the account of Estevan Rodriguez's heirs, if such should be  according to law. The governor then searched for a person to go to  Mindanao, and selected Don Juan Ronquillo, general of the galleys. The  latter was given the necessary reënforcements of men and other things,  with which he reached Mindanao. He took command of the Spanish camp and  fleet which he found in Tampacan. He confirmed the peace and friendship  with the chiefs and people of Tampacan and Lumaguan, restored and set  in better order the Spanish settlement and fort, and began to make  preparation for the war against the people of Buhahayen. He spent  many days in making a few incursions into their land and attacks on  their forts, but without any notable result, for the enemy were many  and all good soldiers, with plenty of arquebuses [63] and artillery,  and had fortified themselves in a strong position. They had many other  fortifications inland and went from one to the other with impunity,  whenever they wished, and greatly harassed the Spaniards, who were  little used to so swampy a country. The latter found themselves short  of provisions without the possibility of getting them in the country  on account of the war, inasmuch as the camp contained many men,  both Spaniards and the native servants and boatmen, and it was not  easy at all times to come and go from one part to another in order  to provide necessities. [64]    Meanwhile Don Juan Ronquillo, seeing that the war was advancing very  slowly and with little result, and that the camp was suffering, drew up  a report of it, and sent letters in all haste to Governor Don Francisco  Tello, informing him of the condition of affairs. He wrote that it  would be better to withdraw the camp from Mindanao River, so that  it might not perish; and that a presidio could be established on the  same island in the port of La Caldera, which could be left fortified,  in order not to abandon this enterprise entirely, and so that their  friends of Tampacan and Lumaguan might be kept hostile to the people  of Buhahayen. Meanwhile he and the rest of the camp and fleet would  return to Manila, if permitted, for which he requested the governor  to send him an order quickly. Upon the receipt of this despatch,  Governor Don Francisco Tello resolved to order Don Juan Ronquillo,  since the above was so and the camp could not be maintained, nor the  war continued advantageously, to withdraw with his whole camp from  Mindanao River. He was first to make a great effort to chastise the  enemy in Buhahayen, and then to burn the Spanish settlement and fort  and to go to La Caldera, fortify it, and leave there a sufficient  garrison with artillery, boats, and provisions for its maintenance and  service. Then he was to return to Manila with the rest of his men,  after telling their friends in Tampacan that the Spaniards would  shortly return to the river better equipped and in greater numbers.    Silonga and other chiefs of Buhahayen were not neglecting their  defense, since, among other measures taken, they had sent a chief to  Terrenate to ask assistance against the Spaniards who had brought  war into their homes. Thereupon the king of Terrenate despatched a  numerous fleet of caracoas and other boats to Mindanao with cachils  [65] and valiant soldiers--more than one thousand fighting men in  all--and a quantity of small artillery, in order to force the Spaniards  to break camp and depart, even could they do nothing else. When the  news reached Buhahayen that this fleet was coming to their defense and  support, they made ready and prepared to attack the Spaniards, who  also having heard the same news were not careless. Consequently the  latter turned their attention more to the main fort, and reduced the  number of men in the smaller forts on Buquil River and other posts,  mouths, and arms of the same river. These served to strengthen the  garrison of the main fort and the armed galleys and other smaller  craft, in order to use the latter to resist the expected attack of  the enemy. The enemy having gallantly advanced to the very fort of  the Spaniards with all their vessels and men, attacked and stormed it  with great courage and resolution, in order to effect an entrance. The  Spaniards within resisted valiantly, and those outside in the galleys  on the river assisted them so effectively that together, with artillery  and arquebuses, and at times in close combat with swords and campilans,  they made a great slaughter and havoc among the men of Terrenate and  those of Buhahayen, who were aiding "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7005"],[0,"The Antiquary — Complete (#13)"],[1,"dragon scales;--their march          Like a rough tumbling storm.--See them, and view them,                         And then see Rome no more!--    Yes, my dear friend, from this stance it is probable--nay, it is nearly  certain, that Julius Agricola beheld what our Beaumont has so admirably  described!--From this very Praetorium\"--    A voice from behind interrupted his ecstatic description--\"Praetorian  here, Praetorian there, I mind the bigging o't.\"    Both at once turned round, Lovel with surprise, and Oldbuck with mingled  surprise and indignation, at so uncivil an interruption. An auditor had  stolen upon them, unseen and unheard, amid the energy of the Antiquary's  enthusiastic declamation, and the attentive civility of Lovel. He  had the exterior appearance of a mendicant. A slouched hat of huge  dimensions; a long white beard which mingled with his grizzled hair;  an aged but strongly marked and expressive countenance, hardened, by  climate and exposure, to a right brick-dust complexion; a long blue  gown, with a pewter badge on the right arm; two or three wallets, or  bags, slung across his shoulder, for holding the different kinds of  meal, when he received his charity in kind from those who were but  a degree richer than himself:--all these marked at once a beggar by  profession, and one of that privileged class which are called in  Scotland the King's Bedesmen, or, vulgarly, Blue-Gowns.    \"What is that you say, Edie?\" said Oldbuck, hoping, perhaps, that his  ears had betrayed their duty--\"what were you speaking about!\"    \"About this bit bourock, your honour,\" answered the undaunted Edie; \"I  mind the bigging o't.\"    \"The devil you do! Why, you old fool, it was here before you were born,  and will be after you are hanged, man!\"    \"Hanged or drowned, here or awa, dead or alive, I mind the bigging o't.\"    \"You--you--you--,\" said the Antiquary, stammering between confusion and  anger, \"you strolling old vagabond, what the devil do you know about  it?\"    \"Ou, I ken this about it, Monkbarns--and what profit have I for telling  ye a lie?--l just ken this about it, that about twenty years syne, I,  and a wheen hallenshakers like mysell, and the mason-lads that built the  lang dike that gaes down the loaning, and twa or three herds maybe,  just set to wark, and built this bit thing here that ye ca'  the--the--Praetorian, and a' just for a bield at auld Aiken Drum's bridal,  and a bit blithe gae-down wi' had in't, some sair rainy weather. Mair by  token, Monkbarns, if ye howk up the bourock, as ye seem to have began,  yell find, if ye hae not fund it already, a stane that ane o' the  mason-callants cut a ladle on to have a bourd at the bridegroom, and he  put four letters on't, that's A. D. L. L.--Aiken Drum's Lang Ladle--for  Aiken was ane o' the kale-suppers o' Fife.\"    \"This,\" thought Lovel to himself, \"is a famous counterpart to the  story of Keip on this syde.\" He then ventured to steal a glance at our  Antiquary, but quickly withdrew it in sheer compassion. For, gentle  reader, if thou hast ever beheld the visage of a damsel of sixteen,  whose romance of true love has been blown up by an untimely discovery,  or of a child of ten years, whose castle of cards has been blown down by  a malicious companion, I can safely aver to you, that Jonathan Oldbuck  of Monkbarns looked neither more wise nor less disconcerted.    \"There is some mistake about this,\" he said, abruptly turning away from  the mendicant.    \"Deil a bit on my side o' the wa',\" answered the sturdy beggar; \"I never  deal in mistakes, they aye bring mischances.--Now, Monkbarns, that young  gentleman, that's wi' your honour, thinks little of a carle like me; and  yet, I'll wager I'll tell him whar he was yestreen at the gloamin, only  he maybe wadna like to hae't spoken o' in company.\"    Lovel's soul rushed to his cheeks, with the vivid blush of  two-and-twenty.    \"Never mind the old rogue,\" said Mr. Oldbuck; \"don't suppose I think  the worse of you for your profession; they are only prejudiced fools and  coxcombs that do so. You remember what old Tully says in his oration,  pro Archia poeta, concerning one of your confraternity--quis nostrum  tam anino agresti ac duro fuit--ut--ut--I forget the Latin--the meaning is,  which of us was so rude and barbarous as to remain unmoved at the death  of the great Roscius, whose advanced age was so far from preparing us  for his death, that we rather hoped one so graceful, so excellent in  his art, ought to be exempted from the common lot of mortality? So the  Prince of Orators spoke of the stage and its professor.\"    The words of the old man fell upon Lovel's ears, but without conveying  any precise idea to his mind, which was then occupied in thinking by  what means the old beggar, who still continued to regard him with a  countenance provokingly sly and intelligent, had contrived to thrust  himself into any knowledge of his affairs. He put his hand in his pocket  as the readiest mode of intimating his desire of secrecy, and securing  the concurrence of the person whom he addressed; and while he bestowed  on him an alms, the amount of which rather bore proportion to his fears  than to his charity, looked at him with a marked expression, which  the mendicant, a physiognomist by profession, seemed perfectly to  understand.--\"Never mind me, sir--I am no tale-pyet; but there are mair  een in the warld than mine,\" answered he as he pocketed Lovel's bounty,  but in a tone to be heard by him alone, and with an expression which  amply filled up what was left unspoken. Then turning to Oldbuck--\"I am  awa' to the manse, your honour. Has your honour ony word there, or to  Sir Arthur, for I'll come in by Knockwinnock Castle again e'en?\"    Oldbuck started as from a dream; and, in a hurried tone, where vexation  strove with a wish to conceal it, paying, at the same time, a tribute  to Edie's smooth, greasy, unlined hat, he said, \"Go down, go down to  Monkbarns--let them give you some dinner--Or stay; if you do go to the  manse, or to Knockwinnock, ye need say nothing about that foolish story  of yours.\"    \"Who, I?\" said the mendicant--\"Lord bless your honour, naebody sall ken a  word about it frae me, mair than if the bit bourock had been there since  Noah's flood. But, Lord, they tell me your honour has gien Johnnie Howie  acre for acre of the laigh crofts for this heathery knowe! Now, if he  has really imposed the bourock on ye for an ancient wark, it's my real  opinion the bargain will never haud gude, if you would just bring down  your heart to try it at the law, and say that he beguiled ye.\"    \"Provoking scoundrel!\" muttered the indignant Antiquary between his  teeths--\"I'll have the hangman's lash and his back acquainted for this.\"  And then, in a louder tone,--\"Never mind, Edie--it is all a mistake.\"    \"Troth, I am thinking sae,\" continued his tormentor, who seemed to have  pleasure in rubbing the galled wound, \"troth, I aye thought sae; and  it's no sae lang since I said to Luckie Gemmers, Never think you,  luckie' said I, that his honour Monkbarns would hae done sic a daft-like  thing as to gie grund weel worth fifty shillings an acre, for a mailing  that would be dear o'a pund Scots. Na, na,' quo' I, depend upon't the  lard's been imposed upon wi that wily do-little deevil, Johnnie Howie.'  But Lord haud a care o' us, sirs, how can that be,' quo' she again, when  the laird's sae book-learned, there's no the like o' him in the country  side, and Johnnie Howie has hardly sense eneugh to ca' the cows out o'  his kale-yard?' Aweel, aweel,' quo' I, but ye'll hear he's circumvented  him with some of his auld-warld stories,'--for ye ken, laird, yon other  time about the bodle that ye thought was an auld coin\"--    \"Go to the devil!\" said Oldbuck; and then in a more mild tone, as one  that was conscious his reputation lay at the mercy of his antagonist, he  added--\"Away with you down to Monkbarns, and when I come back, I'll send  ye a bottle of ale to the kitchen.\"    \"Heaven reward your honour!\" This was uttered with the true mendicant  whine, as, setting his pike-staff before him, he began to move in the  direction of Monkbarns.--\"But did your honour,\" turning round, \"ever get  back the siller ye gae to the travelling packman for the bodle?\"    \"Curse thee, go about thy business!\"    \"Aweel, aweel, sir, God bless your honour! I hope ye'll ding Johnnie  Howie yet, and that I'll live to see it.\" And so saying, the old beggar  moved off, relieving Mr. Oldbuck of recollections which were anything  rather than agreeable.    \"Who is this familiar old gentleman?\" said Lovel, when the mendicant was  out of hearing.    \"O, one of the plagues of the country--I have been always against  poor's-rates and a work-house--I think I'll vote for them now, to have  that scoundrel shut up. O, your old-remembered guest of a beggar becomes  as well acquainted with you as he is with his dish--as intimate as one  of the beasts familiar to man which signify love, and with which his own  trade is especially conversant. Who is he?--why, he has gone the vole--  has been soldier, ballad-singer, travelling tinker, and is now a  beggar. He is spoiled by our foolish gentry, who laugh at his jokes, and  rehearse Edie Ochiltree's good thing's as regularly as Joe Miller's.\"    \"Why, he uses freedom apparently, which is the soul of wit,\" answered  Lovel.    \"O ay, freedom enough,\" said the Antiquary; \"he generally invents some  damned improbable lie or another to provoke you, like that nonsense he  talked just now--not that I'll publish my tract till I have examined the  thing to the bottom.\"    \"In England,\" said Lovel, \"such a mendicant would get a speedy check.\"    \"Yes, your churchwardens and dog-whips would make slender allowance  for his vein of humour! But here, curse him! he is a sort of privileged  nuisance--one of the last specimens of the old fashioned Scottish  mendicant, who kept his rounds within a particular"]]]
