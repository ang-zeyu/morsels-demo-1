He has walked out through the door  being left open.\"    \"Never!\"    \"Money can do more than that, and I rejoice at his freedom.\"    She moved to the door.    But the gaoler held her back rather roughly.    \"Stop you here,\" he said, rudely; \"I shall have to report this to the  governor, and you had better remain until the job has been  investigated.\"    And before the startled woman could divine his intention, he swung to  the door and shot the bolt.    Then pushing back the trap in the door, he added a few words through  the grating.    \"You'll be safer there,\" said he, \"unless you can manage to get out as  Mathias did. But the devil himself must have a compact with Mathias!\"    \"At least leave me the light,\" she said, imploringly.    \"Against orders,\" was all the answer vouchsafed.    The trap was shut.    The woman was left a prisoner, in total darkness.           *       *       *       *       *    There is always something unpleasant in darkness, and this woman was by  no means iron-nerved.    No sooner was she alone, than a painful sensation of uneasiness stole  over her.    \"They can not keep me long here,\" she kept murmuring to herself; \"I  have done nothing; I am accused of no offence. The governor will set me  at liberty as soon as he knows. Could any thing be more unfortunate?  Mathias was a prisoner, and I was at liberty. Now Mathias is free, and  I am a prisoner. Cruel fate to separate us. We are destined to be  parted.\"    The gloom grew oppressive now.    She stood still, listening in painful silence for five minutes  together--five minutes that appeared to be as many hours.    A silence so solemn, so death-like, that she could hear the very  beating of her heart. This grew unbearable.    She groped her way around the cell to find the bed, and approaching the  fireplace, she was suddenly startled by a sound.    A very faint noise, as of something dripping on the flagstones by her  feet.    In the tomb-like silence then reigning, the faintest sound caused her  to feel uncomfortable.    She listened awhile intently, asking herself what it could mean.    Drip, drip, drip.    It was strange.    When the light was there, she had not noticed it at all.    What could it be then, that was only to be heard in the dark?    Was it fancy?    No.    It was too real.    There was no mistaking it.    If the oppressive gloom of the cell started strange sounds or strange  fancies in her head, why should it take such a shape as that?    Why, indeed?    \"Would to Heaven they were back with the light,\" she said. \"Will they  never come?\"    Just then, as though her earnest wish were heard and answered, a faint  thin streak of light was shot into the cell through the grated window  above.    This was reflected from a chamber in the prison whose window was close  by the window of this cell, and where a lamp had just been lighted.    The welcome ray shot straight across the cell where she stood by the  fireplace, and she remarked that the dripping did not cease.    Drip, drip, drip!    She looked down.    \"I see, I see,\" she shudderingly exclaimed, \"it is raining, and the  rain is falling down the chimney. How foolish of me to get alarmed  about nothing.\"    Now the light, we have said, shot across the hearth, and here it was  that the drip, drip, drip, fell.    \"Same as I thought.\"    As she muttered this to herself, she stretched forth her hand under the  chimney, and the next drop fell upon it. It was not water.    No, imperfect as was the light then, it sufficed to show her that upon  her hand was a curiously dark stain.    Raising it nearer to her eyes, she examined it eagerly.    Then she shuddered, and exclaimed in a voice of terror--\"Blood!\"    Yes, it was blood.    Pen can not describe the terror of that wretched woman upon making this  alarming discovery.    \"Blood! Whose? Hah! whose blood? Whose but his--whose but the blood of  my darling--my own Mathias?\"    For a moment the thought completely unnerved her, and it was little  short of a miracle that she kept from fainting.    But she fought bravely with the deathly horror stealing over her.    And kneeling on the hearth, she called up, yet in gentle voice, lest  she should give the alarm--    \"Mathias! Mathias, my own! Do you not know me? Mathias, I say!\"    She listened--listened eagerly for a reply.    And presently it came--a dull, hollow moan, a cry of anguish that  chilled the blood in her heart, that froze the very marrow in her  bones.    \"Mathias, darling Mathias! answer me for the love of mercy; I shall die  else.\"    Another moan was heard.    Fainter and fainter even than the first.    Yet full of pent-up suffering.    A sound that told a whole tale of anguish.    \"Mathias, come to me,\" she called again.    \"Oh-h-h!\"    A fearfully prolonged groan came down to her, louder than before, as if  the sufferer had put all his remaining strength into the effort.    Then all was silent.    Eagerly she listened, straining forward to catch the faintest breath.    But the voice above was stilled for ever.    And yet the drip, drip, drip continued, and as she stretched forward  beneath the chimney, she caught the drops upon her face.    Then she could no longer thrust back conviction.    With a wild cry of terror she drew back, and groped her way round the  room towards the door.    Her hand rested upon the grated trap, and she pushed it back with all  her force, crying aloud for help as she did so.    \"Help, help!\" she shouted with the energy of despair; \"Mathias is  dying.\"    But that wretched man would not trouble the authorities more--His last  breath had been drawn as she stood there listening to those awesome  sounds.    What could be the solution of this mystery!    This would be known soon now, for the sounds of footsteps were  distinctly heard now in the long stone corridors of the prison.    The gaolers had given the alarm at once of the prisoner's escape, and  the outlets of the prison were guarded in all directions, while a party  was sent to the cell to investigate the matter thoroughly.    At the head of this party was the governor himself.    The time had appeared ten times as long to the unhappy woman as it was  in reality.    \"Help, help! oh, help!\" she cried.    At each effort she grew weaker and weaker. Her voice died away, and  when they reached the door of the cell, they found her hanging by the  bars of the grated window or trap more dead than alive.    \"Show the light,\" ejaculated the governor.    And then, as the rays fell upon that face, pallid as the flesh of a  corpse, save where the dark blood stains had settled, there was an  involuntary exclamation of horror from all the beholders.    \"Father of mercy,\" cried one of the men; \"she has destroyed herself.\"    Such was the general idea.    She had committed suicide.    In this, however, they were speedily undeceived.    To burst open the door and rush into the cell was but the work of a  moment.    At this the woman rallied a little and recovered herself.    \"What is the matter?\" asked the governor.    \"The chimney!\" gasped the woman faintly.    \"The chimney! Speak--explain.\"    \"His blood--Mathias's,\" she said; \"see the chimney. I dare not look.\"    Two of the men by now had approached the chimney, and lowering the  light they carried, one of them discovered a dark ominous pool upon the  hearth.    \"Call the doctor; there is something more than meets the eye in this.\"    This order was promptly obeyed, and a surgeon was speedily in  attendance. A mere cursory glance convinced the man of skill that the  blood upon the woman's face was not her own, and just as he arrived at  the decision, drip, drip, drip it began again upon the hearth.    The men looked at each other half scared, and the governor himself was  scarcely more self-possessed.    The surgeon alone retained his presence of mind.    Snatching a lamp from one of the men, he thrust it as far as his arm  could reach up the chimney and looked earnestly up.    \"As I thought!\" he exclaimed.    \"What?\" demanded the governor, eagerly.    \"He is there.\"    \"Who?\"    \"Who but the prisoner? Mathias is there--hopelessly stuck--wedged in.  He has been trying to escape and has hurt himself.\"    The woman looked up at these words.    \"Is it no worse?\" she asked. \"Is he badly hurt?\"    \"I can not say yet,\" said the surgeon; \"we must get him down first.\"    This proved a very difficult matter indeed.    The flue was so narrow that it was sheer madness to attempt climbing  it.    Eagerly Mathias had pushed on, and finally got himself wedged  inextricably.    He could neither move up nor down.    It was when he made this alarming discovery that his struggles became  desperate, and in his wild efforts to free himself from his self-set  trap, he tore and mutilated his flesh most cruelly.    The wounds and the want of air had done their work.    An hour's hard work succeeded in setting the prisoner free--or rather  his body, for it was found that life had been extinct, according to the  surgeon's report, before they had entered the cell.    And when they came to examine the clothes, they made a discovery which  threw a light upon the whole affair.    A small scrap of paper, dirty and crumpled was found in his pocket,  upon which was some writing that was with great difficulty construed in  this wise--    \"The only hope is from the waterside. If you can but reach the roof,  and have the courage to make the plunge, freedom will be your reward.\"    How this note came there was never discovered.    With this dire catastrophe ended the efforts of the brigands to free  their unhappy leader.          CHAPTER XI.    MR. MOLE VISITS THE WIZARD--THE MAGIC MIRROR AND THE LIFE-LIKE  VISION--THE INCANTATION--THE CHARMED WIG.      \"In point of fact, sir,\" said young Jack to his tutor one morning, \"it  is about the only thing worth seeing here.\"    \"What is, Jack?\"    \"The wizard.\"    Mr. Mole looked very straight at his pupil upon this."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#13)"],[1,"valuable than  the rest had better be put up to auction, and whatever they fetch also  divided among the men. Were the Malays in force?\"    \"The place swarmed with them, sir, but they were evidently demoralized  by the fire of the guns, and their attacks were really feeble. The only  trouble we had was that some would shut themselves up in houses. It  looked at first as if they really meant to fight, but directly the  shells began to fall behind them, and fire broke out, they lost heart  altogether, and made a bolt for the forest.\"    \"Well, the work has been thoroughly done, Mr. Ferguson, and Sehi has had  a lesson that he won't forget. Now we have to tackle his fleet.\"    \"Everything is ready, sir. We have got the sledges made for the two  guns, and a store of long bamboos for the carriages and anything else we  may want to take with us.\"    \"This will be a more serious business by a long way,\" the captain said.  \"The men had better take a hundred rounds of ammunition with them, and  it would be as well to take a few boxes of spare cartridges; and the  men not occupied in dragging the cannon and carrying the carriages, must  take up as many rounds of shell as possible, and eight or ten rounds  of grape for each gun. You have got the sacks ready for forming the  battery; that will be absolutely necessary for the protection of the men  firing. Each of the prahus has probably got at least half a dozen small  guns, and it would be hardly possible to work our pieces unless the men  were protected from their concentrated fire. Tell the chief engineer  that steam must be got up by six o'clock. In the meantime, let a slow  fire be kept up towards the edge of the forest, just a shot every five  minutes, which will be enough to show them we are still here, and have  not done with them yet. When the place cools down a bit, we will send  a party on shore to keep up a dropping fire against the forest, and so  induce them to believe that we mean to attack them there.\"        CHAPTER VIII.      During the rest of the day preparations were actively carried on for the  night's work. The fifty marines and a hundred bluejackets were to take  part in the landing expedition; the ammunition to be carried was ranged  along the deck, and the men told off for the various work there was  to be done, some being allotted to carry stretchers and surgical  requirements for the wounded. The first lieutenant was to command the  party, having with him the third lieutenant, the master's mate, and  the two senior midshipmen; besides, of course, the marine officers. Dr.  Horsley was also to accompany them. Some cartridges were made up with  powder and musket bullets for two of the brass guns captured, in order  that, if the Malays succeeded in landing, they might meet with a hot  reception. It was decided that no carriages should be taken for them,  but that they should be simply laid on the sandbags.    The party on shore had kept up a fire all day at the forest. The yells  of defiance which at times rose showed that the Malays were in great  force all round its edge. Towards evening all on shore returned to  the ship. As soon as it became absolutely dark, the anchor chain was  unshackled, and a buoy being attached to the end, it was noiselessly  lowered into the water. Then the screw began to revolve, and the vessel  gradually backed down the river. All lights had been extinguished, and  no sound from the forest showed that the movement had been observed.  A mile lower down the ship was turned, the screw began to revolve more  rapidly, and at half speed she ran down to the junction of the two  branches of the river, and steamed up the other arm until within half a  mile or so of the village at the mouth of the creek. Then a light anchor  was let go, the boats were lowered, and the landing party took their  places in them; the oars were all muffled, and keeping close to the  right bank of the river, they rowed up until past the village, and then  crossing, entered the mouth of the creek, and rowed up it until they  reached the spot where the landing had been effected on the previous  night.    Half a dozen men provided with well greased saws first landed under Dick  Balderson's command, and cleared a passage six feet wide to the path;  then the landing began in earnest. The guns were first put on shore, and  carried bodily to the path; the rest of the marines and the bluejackets  then landed, each carrying, in addition to his arms and ammunition,  a gun cartridge, or a box of rifle ammunition, and a couple of empty  sacks. As fast as they landed they proceeded up the path. Dick Balderson  led the way, and the men were directed to step as closely as they could  to each other. As they arrived near the pool, each deposited his burden,  and then went back to assist to drag up the guns and carriages.    Scarcely a sound was heard during the operation. Their feet fell  noiselessly on the soft earth of the track, and no one a few yards  away would have guessed that a hundred and fifty men were engaged in  laborious toil. There was far more noise than there had been the night  before on board the prahus, an incessant jabber being maintained, and  voices rang high in excitement as the men discussed the destruction of  the town and the orders that had been received for a portion of them to  land on the following morning and take part in the annihilation of the  whites if they entered into the forest. As soon as the two heavy guns  were placed upon their carriages, just behind the screen of bushes, the  greater portion of the men were sent back as far as the point where  they had landed, there to fill the sacks with earth from the bank of the  river, a number of shovels having been brought for the purpose.    Several large bundles of bamboos, cut into lengths six feet long, and  sharpened at both ends, had been among the articles taken up to the  battery, and while most of the men were engaged filling and carrying the  sacks of earth, some were employed in constructing chevaux de frise, ten  paces on each side of the spot where the battery was being constructed.  The bamboos were set diagonally a foot and a half into the soft earth,  and bound together by being lashed to strong poles running along them.  These fences extended from the edge of the bushes by the water to the  trees. The forest behind was so thick and entangled with creepers that  there was little fear of an attack being made from that quarter.    Accustomed to work in the darkness, the sailors had no difficulty in  carrying out the operation, and before morning broke the battery was  complete. It was six feet high on the side facing the water, with two  embrasures for the guns, four feet high on the sides covered by the  chevaux de frise. The front face was twenty-five feet in length, the  sides forty. Morning was breaking as the work was finished, and bread  and cold meat were served out, with a full ration of grog. By the time  these were consumed it was broad daylight; for there is little twilight  so near the equator.    \"Now for it, Dick,\" Harry Parkhurst said, as the lieutenant gave the  signal for all to rise and take their places. Filing out of the battery,  the marines lined the bank on one side, and the sailors, other than  those who were to work the guns, on the other. Some of the sailors  climbed over the front wall and with their jackknives cut away the  boughs in front of the guns. There was silence on board the prahus,  where the Malays had dropped off to sleep a couple of hours before  daylight. Mr. Ferguson himself superintended the laying of the guns,  seeing that each was most carefully trained upon the waterline of a  prahu. As the distance was some seventy or eighty yards, he had little  doubt that the two vessels aimed at would be sunk at once. When he was  thoroughly satisfied, he drew back and gave the order to fire.    The two reports sounded as if one, and were mingled with the explosion  of shells as they struck the prahus exactly on the waterline. There was  a momentary silence, and then a wild hubbub of yells of surprise and  fury, while a loud cheer broke from the British, as they saw the success  of the shots. Almost instantly the two craft struck began to settle  down, and in a minute disappeared, the water being covered with the  heads of the crew, who were swimming to the other prahus. The guns  of these had evidently been kept loaded, for before the two eighteen  pounders were again ready, a fire was opened by the four craft, one or  two balls striking the sandbags, while the rest went crashing into the  forest behind. Every shot from the British guns struck the prahus, but  none effected such damage as the first two fired.    \"They are taking to their boats, Ferguson,\" the doctor, who was standing  beside him, said.    \"Yes, but I fancy they have no thought of giving it up at present; they  are going to make a dash at us. They can still work their guns and spare  any amount of men to attack us.\"    The next minute, indeed, a dozen boats, crammed with men, shot round  from behind the prahus.    \"Grape now,\" the lieutenant ordered, while, at the same moment, the  marines and seamen, who had hitherto been silent, opened fire from under  the bushes, beneath which they were enabled to obtain a view of what was  going on.    Two of the boats were sunk by the discharge of the grape; but the  others, without checking their course, pushed on.    \"Quick, lads, give them another round before it is too late.\"    The guns were loaded with incredible quickness, and two more of the  boats were shattered, their swarthy occupants striking out for the  shore, making for the most part towards the battery, as did the boats.  Twenty of the sailors and as many marines were at once called in from  the bank to aid in the defense of the battery, and a desperate conflict  was presently raging here and along the bank, the Malays, swarming up,  striving to force their way up"]]]
