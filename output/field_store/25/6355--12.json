Nothing but an untrimmed  bamboo staff nearly 30 feet long, carrying an oblong strip of soiled  white calico between two such strips of red turkey twill. Tattered and  frayed, the flags seemed to tell of the desperate appeal for help of some  forlorn castaway; of a human being, marooned on a lonely sandbank on the  Barrier, without shelter, food or water, but not altogether bereft of  hope. BECHE-DE-MER fishers have in times past been marooned on the Reef  by mutinous blacks, and left to die by slow degrees, or to be drowned by  the implacable yet merciful tide. A makeshift rudder well worn bespoke  strenuous efforts to steer a troubled boat to shelter, but this crude  signal staff, deftly arranged, told of present agony and stress. It might  have been the emblem of a tragic event that the Beachcomber single-handed  was not able to investigate. As a matter of fact, it was only a temporary  datum of one of His Majesty's surveying ships engaged in attempting to  set the bounds of the Barrier.    Rarely do we sail about without enjoying the zest of the chance of  getting something for nothing. Not yet has the seaman's chest,  brass-bound, with its secret compartments full of \"fair rose-nobles and  bright moidores,\" been lighted upon; but who can say? Perhaps it has  come ashore but now, after leagues of aimless wanderings, and awaits in  some cosy cove the next Beachcombing expedition. That from the ill-fated  MERCHANT came hither years before my time, and was, in any case,  pathetically unromantic.    Peradventure there are many who deem this solitary existence dull? Why,  it is brimful of interest and sensation. There are the tragedies of the  bush to observe and elucidate; all cannot be foreseen and prevented, or  even avenged. A bold falcon the other day swooped down upon a wood-swallow  that was imitating the falcon's flight just above my head, and bore it  bleeding to a tree-top, while I stood shocked at the audacity of the  cannibal. A bullet dropped the murderous bird with its dead victim fast  in the talons. There are comedies, too, and you have the wit to see them,  and in these Beachcombing expeditions expectation, fairly effervesces.    One lucky individual--a mere amateur--casually picked up a black-lip  mother-of-pearl shell on an island some little distance away. It  contained a blue pearl, the price of which gave him such a start in life,  that he is now an owner of ships. May not other tides cast up on other  shores other oysters whose lives have been rendered miserable by the  presence of pearls?    Byron says--\"Even an oyster may be crossed in love.\" Science, more  precise and frank than the frankest of poets, tells us that oysters are  afflicted with tapeworms, and to kill the germ of these indecent pests,  enclose them in untimely tombs, which from the human standpoint are among  the most lovely and precious of gems. The assertions of the scientific  are often the reverse of poetical. We are constrained to believe them,  but like our poetical delusions better, and for the origin of the pearl  prefer the quaint fable of the Persians to the unpleasant fact of the  zoologist. A drop of water of ineffable purity falls from heaven to the  sea, an oyster gapes and swallows it, the drop hardens and ripens, and  becomes a pearl; and who is so devoid of the perception of purity, beauty  and worth as to despise a pearl?    Here about, pearls were found. We delight in them, though they prove the  previous existence of a filthy ailment. Any oyster may contain a pearl, a  pearl of great price--a thing of beauty, a joy for ever. Every gold-lip,  every black-lip oyster, is a chance in a lottery. Was there ever a  Beachcomber so pure and elevated of soul as to refuse the chances that  Nature proffers gratuitously? My meagre horde includes pearls of several  tints, black, pink, and white. They represent the paltriest prizes. in  the lottery that no Government, however paternal, may prohibit, being  mere \"baroque,\" fit only to be pounded up as medicine for some Chinaman  luxuriously sick. Yet there is a chance. Some day the great prize may be  drawn. And then, \"Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?\" The  Beachcomber may be perverted into--well, the next best on the list. Yet  they say in pitiful tones, those who rake among the muck of the streets,  \"What a dull life! What a hopeless existence! He is out of it all!\" Yes,  with a gladsome mind, and all its sounds, if not forgotten, at least  muffled by music, soft as dawn, profound as the very sea.    Kennedy Shoal has been mentioned incidentally. Some miles further north  are two bare sandbanks. Prior to the year 1890 they were occupied by a  BECHE-DE-MER fisherman, whose headquarters were on the chief of the South  Barnard Islands--some 12 or 14 miles to the north. In fateful March of  that year a cyclone swooped down on this part of the coast with the  pent up fury of a century's restraint. The enormous bloodwood-trees torn  out by the roots on Dunk Island testified to the force and ferocity of  the storm. The sandbanks, are isolated, dreary spots, the highest portion  but 2 or 3 feet above the level reached by spring tides. A cutter--THE  DOLPHIN--with a crew of aboriginals, in charge of a couple of Kanakas, was  anchored at the shoal, and as the cyclone worked up, the Kanakas decided  that the one and only bid for life was to run before it to the mainland.  It was a forlorn hope--so forlorn that four or five of the aboriginals  declined to take part in it, deeming it safer to trust to the sandbank,  which they imagined could never be entirely swept by the besoms of the  sea. The cutter fled before the storm, only to capsize in the breakers  off the mouth of the Johnstone River. Clinging to the wreck until it  drifted a few miles south, the Kanakas and crew battled through the waves  and eventually reached the shore. Of those who placed their faith on the  sandbank not one was spared. The seas raced over it, pounded and  flattened it. The men upon it were unconsidered trifles.    The tall and handsome Scandinavian whose fortune thus assailed was at his  home with his wife and children and brother. His yacht--THE MAUD--in the  height of the storm, began to drag her anchor. He and his brother went  out in a dinghy to secure her. At dusk the wife, young, petite and  pretty, with strained anxiety watched the efforts of the men to beat back  to shelter. Darkness came, blotting out the scene and its climax. Never  after was anything seen or heard of the brothers or the yacht. And for  nearly a fortnight the disconsolate wife and her little ones were alone on  the island.    Ten years later, on one of the two bare patches of sand, another  BECHE-DE-MER smoke-house was built. While the owner a swarthy Arabian,  was out on the reef miles away, a phenomenally high tide occurred. His  wife--a comely girl of British descent--was alone on the shoal. She  watched the rising water apprehensively, until all the sand was covered  save the few feet on which the frail shelter stood. One more ripple and  the floor was swamped. Then, wading and swimming, she managed to reach a  punt, and so saved her life. Since then these patches of sand have not  been regarded as a safe outpost even by those most venturesome of  people--BECHE-DE-MER fishers.    This is not an apology, but a confession; not a plea of defence, but a  justification--a fair and free chronicle, a frank acknowledgment of the  tributes of impartial Neptune--Neptune who gives and who takes away--who  stealthily filches with tireless fingers, and who, when in the mood, robs  so remorselessly, and with such awful, such majestic violence, that it  were impious to whimper. Who beachcombed my three rudders, the one  toilfully adzed out in one piece from the beautiful heart of a bean-tree  log, another cunningly fitted with a sliding fin, and that of red cedar  with famous brass mountings? Who owns the pair of ballast tanks once  mine? Who the buoy deemed securely moored? Who the paddles and the  rowlocks and the signal halyards, lost because of Neptune's whims and  violence? Beachcombing is a nicely adjusted, if not quite an exact art.  Not once but several times has the libertine Neptune scandalously seduced  punts and dinghies from the respectable precincts of Brammo Bay, and  having philandered with them for a while, cynically abandoned them with a  bump on the mainland beach, and only once has he sent a punt in return--a  poor, soiled, tar-besmirched, disorderly waif that was reported to the  police and reluctantly claimed.    A mind inclined to casuistry, could it not defend Beachcombing? Does not  the law recognise it under the definition of trover? Why bother about the  law and the moralities when it is all so pleasing, so engrossing, and so  fair?    The Beachcomber wants no extensive establishment. His possessions need  never be mortgaged. The cost of living is measurable by a standard  adjustable to individual taste, wants and perceptions. The expenditure of  a little manual labour supplies the omissions of and compensates for  the undirected impulses which prevail, and the pursuit--not the  profession--leads one to ever-varying scenes, to the contemplation of many  of the moods of unaffected, unadvertised Nature. Ashore, one dallies  luxuriously with time, free from all the restrictions of streets, every  precious moment his very own; afloat in these calm and shallow waters  there is a never-ending panorama of entertainment. Coral gardens--gardens  of the sea nymphs, wherein fancy feigns cool, shy, chaste faces and  pliant forms half-revealed among gently swaying robes; a company of  porpoise, a herd of dugong; turtle, queer and familiar fish, occasionally  the spouting of a great whale, and always the company of swift and  graceful birds. Sometimes the whole expansive ocean is as calm as it can  only be in the tropics and bordered by the Barrier Reef--a shield of  shimmering silver from which the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#13)"],[1,"my fingers are likely enough to be  imbued. Our worshipful friend Rappaccini, as I have heard, tinctures  his medicaments with odors richer than those of Araby. Doubtless,  likewise, the fair and learned Signora Beatrice would minister to her  patients with draughts as sweet as a maiden's breath; but woe to him  that sips them!\"    Giovanni's face evinced many contending emotions. The tone in which the  professor alluded to the pure and lovely daughter of Rappaccini was a  torture to his soul; and yet the intimation of a view of her character  opposite to his own, gave instantaneous distinctness to a thousand dim  suspicions, which now grinned at him like so many demons. But he strove  hard to quell them and to respond to Baglioni with a true lover's  perfect faith.    \"Signor professor,\" said he, \"you were my father's friend; perchance,  too, it is your purpose to act a friendly part towards his son. I would  fain feel nothing towards you save respect and deference; but I pray  you to observe, signor, that there is one subject on which we must not  speak. You know not the Signora Beatrice. You cannot, therefore,  estimate the wrong--the blasphemy, I may even say--that is offered to  her character by a light or injurious word.\"    \"Giovanni! my poor Giovanni!\" answered the professor, with a calm  expression of pity, \"I know this wretched girl far better than  yourself. You shall hear the truth in respect to the poisoner  Rappaccini and his poisonous daughter; yes, poisonous as she is  beautiful. Listen; for, even should you do violence to my gray hairs,  it shall not silence me. That old fable of the Indian woman has become  a truth by the deep and deadly science of Rappaccini and in the person  of the lovely Beatrice.\"    Giovanni groaned and hid his face    \"Her father,\" continued Baglioni, \"was not restrained by natural  affection from offering up his child in this horrible manner as the  victim of his insane zeal for science; for, let us do him justice, he  is as true a man of science as ever distilled his own heart in an  alembic. What, then, will be your fate? Beyond a doubt you are selected  as the material of some new experiment. Perhaps the result is to be  death; perhaps a fate more awful still. Rappaccini, with what he calls  the interest of science before his eyes, will hesitate at nothing.\"    \"It is a dream,\" muttered Giovanni to himself; \"surely it is a dream.\"    \"But,\" resumed the professor, \"be of good cheer, son of my friend. It  is not yet too late for the rescue. Possibly we may even succeed in  bringing back this miserable child within the limits of ordinary  nature, from which her father's madness has estranged her. Behold this  little silver vase! It was wrought by the hands of the renowned  Benvenuto Cellini, and is well worthy to be a love gift to the fairest  dame in Italy. But its contents are invaluable. One little sip of this  antidote would have rendered the most virulent poisons of the Borgias  innocuous. Doubt not that it will be as efficacious against those of  Rappaccini. Bestow the vase, and the precious liquid within it, on your  Beatrice, and hopefully await the result.\"    Baglioni laid a small, exquisitely wrought silver vial on the table and  withdrew, leaving what he had said to produce its effect upon the young  man's mind.    \"We will thwart Rappaccini yet,\" thought he, chuckling to himself, as  he descended the stairs; \"but, let us confess the truth of him, he is a  wonderful man--a wonderful man indeed; a vile empiric, however, in his  practice, and therefore not to be tolerated by those who respect the  good old rules of the medical profession.\"    Throughout Giovanni's whole acquaintance with Beatrice, he had  occasionally, as we have said, been haunted by dark surmises as to her  character; yet so thoroughly had she made herself felt by him as a  simple, natural, most affectionate, and guileless creature, that the  image now held up by Professor Baglioni looked as strange and  incredible as if it were not in accordance with his own original  conception. True, there were ugly recollections connected with his  first glimpses of the beautiful girl; he could not quite forget the  bouquet that withered in her grasp, and the insect that perished amid  the sunny air, by no ostensible agency save the fragrance of her  breath. These incidents, however, dissolving in the pure light of her  character, had no longer the efficacy of facts, but were acknowledged  as mistaken fantasies, by whatever testimony of the senses they might  appear to be substantiated. There is something truer and more real than  what we can see with the eyes and touch with the finger. On such better  evidence had Giovanni founded his confidence in Beatrice, though rather  by the necessary force of her high attributes than by any deep and  generous faith on his part. But now his spirit was incapable of  sustaining itself at the height to which the early enthusiasm of  passion had exalted it; he fell down, grovelling among earthly doubts,  and defiled therewith the pure whiteness of Beatrice's image. Not that  he gave her up; he did but distrust. He resolved to institute some  decisive test that should satisfy him, once for all, whether there were  those dreadful peculiarities in her physical nature which could not be  supposed to exist without some corresponding monstrosity of soul. His  eyes, gazing down afar, might have deceived him as to the lizard, the  insect, and the flowers; but if he could witness, at the distance of a  few paces, the sudden blight of one fresh and healthful flower in  Beatrice's hand, there would be room for no further question. With this  idea he hastened to the florist's and purchased a bouquet that was  still gemmed with the morning dew-drops.    It was now the customary hour of his daily interview with Beatrice.  Before descending into the garden, Giovanni failed not to look at his  figure in the mirror,--a vanity to be expected in a beautiful young  man, yet, as displaying itself at that troubled and feverish moment,  the token of a certain shallowness of feeling and insincerity of  character. He did gaze, however, and said to himself that his features  had never before possessed so rich a grace, nor his eyes such vivacity,  nor his cheeks so warm a hue of superabundant life.    \"At least,\" thought he, \"her poison has not yet insinuated itself into  my system. I am no flower to perish in her grasp.\"    With that thought he turned his eyes on the bouquet, which he had never  once laid aside from his hand. A thrill of indefinable horror shot  through his frame on perceiving that those dewy flowers were already  beginning to droop; they wore the aspect of things that had been fresh  and lovely yesterday. Giovanni grew white as marble, and stood  motionless before the mirror, staring at his own reflection there as at  the likeness of something frightful. He remembered Baglioni's remark  about the fragrance that seemed to pervade the chamber. It must have  been the poison in his breath! Then he shuddered--shuddered at himself.  Recovering from his stupor, he began to watch with curious eye a spider  that was busily at work hanging its web from the antique cornice of the  apartment, crossing and recrossing the artful system of interwoven  lines--as vigorous and active a spider as ever dangled from an old  ceiling. Giovanni bent towards the insect, and emitted a deep, long  breath. The spider suddenly ceased its toil; the web vibrated with a  tremor originating in the body of the small artisan. Again Giovanni  sent forth a breath, deeper, longer, and imbued with a venomous feeling  out of his heart: he knew not whether he were wicked, or only  desperate. The spider made a convulsive gripe with his limbs and hung  dead across the window.    \"Accursed! accursed!\" muttered Giovanni, addressing himself. \"Hast thou  grown so poisonous that this deadly insect perishes by thy breath?\"    At that moment a rich, sweet voice came floating up from the garden.    \"Giovanni! Giovanni! It is past the hour! Why tarriest thou? Come down!\"    \"Yes,\" muttered Giovanni again. \"She is the only being whom my breath  may not slay! Would that it might!\"    He rushed down, and in an instant was standing before the bright and  loving eyes of Beatrice. A moment ago his wrath and despair had been so  fierce that he could have desired nothing so much as to wither her by a  glance; but with her actual presence there came influences which had  too real an existence to be at once shaken off: recollections of the  delicate and benign power of her feminine nature, which had so often  enveloped him in a religious calm; recollections of many a holy and  passionate outgush of her heart, when the pure fountain had been  unsealed from its depths and made visible in its transparency to his  mental eye; recollections which, had Giovanni known how to estimate  them, would have assured him that all this ugly mystery was but an  earthly illusion, and that, whatever mist of evil might seem to have  gathered over her, the real Beatrice was a heavenly angel. Incapable as  he was of such high faith, still her presence had not utterly lost its  magic. Giovanni's rage was quelled into an aspect of sullen  insensibility. Beatrice, with a quick spiritual sense, immediately felt  that there was a gulf of blackness between them which neither he nor  she could pass. They walked on together, sad and silent, and came thus  to the marble fountain and to its pool of water on the ground, in the  midst of which grew the shrub that bore gem-like blossoms. Giovanni was  affrighted at the eager enjoyment--the appetite, as it were--with which  he found himself inhaling the fragrance of the flowers.    \"Beatrice,\" asked he, abruptly, \"whence came this shrub?\"    \"My father created it,\" answered she, with simplicity.    \"Created it! created it!\" repeated Giovanni. \"What mean you, Beatrice?\"    \"He is a man fearfully acquainted with the "]]]
