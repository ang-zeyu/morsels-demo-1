At that moment they were  over a large island, which had suddenly loomed up in the wild and  desolate waste of the ocean. They had reached its vicinity just in  time.    Tom stepped to the steering and rudder levers, and took charge. He  was going to attempt a most difficult feat--that of guiding a  disabled airship back to earth in the midst of a hurricane, and  landing her on an unknown island. Could he do it?    There was but one answer. He must try. It was the only chance of  saving their lives, and a slim one at best.    Down shot the damaged WHIZZER like some giant bird with broken  wings, but Tom Swift was in charge, and it seemed as if the craft  knew it, as she began that earthward glide.          CHAPTER XIII    ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND      Mingled feelings possessed the three adventurers within the airship.  Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick had crowded to the window, as Tom spoke,  to get a glimpse of the unknown island toward which they were  shooting. They could see it more plainly now, from the forward  casement, as well as from the one in the bottom of the craft. A  long, narrow, rugged piece of land it was, in the midst of the  heaving ocean, for the storm still raged and lashed the waves to  foam.    \"Can you make it?\" asked Mr. Damon, in a low voice.    \"I think so,\" answered Tom, more cheerfully.    \"Shall I shut down the motor?\" inquired the older inventor.    \"Yes, you might as well. We don't need the propellers now, and I may  be better able to make the glide without them.\"    The buzzing and purring electrical apparatus was shut down. Silence  reigned in the airship, but the wind still howled outside. As Tom  had hoped, the ship became a little more steady with the stopping of  the big curved blades, though had the craft been undamaged they  would have served to keep her on an even keel.    With skillful hand he so tilted the elevating planes that, after a  swift downward glide, the head of the WHIZZER would be thrown up, so  to speak, and she would sail along in a plane parallel to the  island. This had the effect of checking her momentum, just as the  aviator checks the downward rush of his monoplane or biplane when he  is making a landing.    Tom repeated this maneuver several times, until a glance at his  barograph showed that they had but a scant sixty feet to go. There  was time but for one more upward throwing of the WHIZZER's nose, and  Tom held to that position as long as possible. They could now make  out the topography of the island plainly, for it was much lighter.  Tom saw a stretch of sandy beach, and steered for that.    Downward shot the airship, inert and lifeless. It was not like  gliding his little BUTTERFLY to earth after a flight, but Tom hoped  he could make it. They were now within ten feet of the earth,  skimming forward. Tom tried another upward tilt, but the forward  planes would not respond. They could get no grip on the air.    With a crash that could have been heard some distance the WHIZZER  settled to the sand. It ran along a slight distance, and then, as  the bicycle wheels collapsed under the pressure, the airship seemed  to go together in a shapeless mass.    At the first impact with the earth, Tom had leaped away from the  steering wheel and levers, for he did not want to be crushed against  them. Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick, in pursuance of a plan adopted when  they found that they were falling, had piled a lot of seat cushions  around them. They had also provided some as buffers for Tom, and our  hero, at the instant of the crash, had thrown himself behind and  upon them.    It seemed as if the whole ship went to pieces. The top of the main  cabin crashed down, as the side supports gave way, but, fortunately,  there were strong main braces, and the roof did not fall completely  upon our friends.    The whole bottom of the craft was forced upward and had it not been  for the protecting cushions, there might have been serious injuries  for all concerned. As it was they were badly bruised and shaken up.    After the first crash, and succeeding it an instant later, there  came a second smash, followed by a slight explosion, and a shower of  sparks could be seen in the engine room.    \"That's the electrical apparatus smashing through the floor!\" called  Tom. \"Come, let's get out of here before the gasolene sets anything  on fire. Are you all right, Mr. Damon, and you, Mr. Fenwick?\"    \"Yes, I guess so,\" answered the inventor. \"Oh, what a terrible  crash! My airship is ruined!\"    \"You may be glad we are alive,\" said Mr. Damon. \"Bless my top knot,  I feel--\"    He did not finish the sentence. At that moment a piece of wood,  broken from the ceiling, where it had hung by a strip of canvas came  crashing down, and hit Mr. Damon on the head.    The eccentric man toppled over on his pile of cushions, from which  he was arising when he was struck.    \"Oh, is he killed?\" gasped Mr. Fenwick.    \"I hope not!\" cried Tom. \"We must get him out of here, at all  events. There may be a fire.\"    They both sprang to Mr. Damon's aid, and succeeded in lifting him  out. There was no difficulty in emerging from the airship as there  were big, broken gaps, on all sides of what was left of the cabin.  Once in the outer air Mr. Damon revived, and opened his eyes.    \"Much hurt?\" asked Tom, feeling of his friend's head.    \"No--no, I--I guess not,\" was the slow answer. \"I was stunned for a  moment. I'm all right now. Nothing broken, I guess,\" and his hand  went to his head.    \"No, nothing broken,\" added Tom, cheerfully, \"but you've got a lump  there as big as an ostrich egg. Can you walk?\"    \"Oh, I'm all right. Bless my stars, what a wreck!\"    Mr. Damon looked at the remains of the airship. It certainly was a  wreck! The bent and twisted planes were wrapped about the afterpart,  the gas bag was but a shred, the frame was splintered and twisted,  and the under part, where the starting wheels were placed, resembled  a lot of broken bicycles. The cabin looked like a shack that had  sustained an explosion of dynamite.    \"It's a wonder we came out alive,\" said Mr. Fenwick, in a low voice.    \"Indeed it is,\" agreed Tom, as he came back with a tin can full of  sea water, with which to bathe Mr. Damon's head. The lad had picked  up the can from where it had rolled from the wreck, and they had  landed right on the beach.    \"It doesn't seem to blow so hard,\" observed Mr. Damon, as he was  tenderly sopping his head with a handkerchief wet in the salt water.    \"No, the wind is dying out, but it happened too late to do us any  good,\" remarked Tom, sorrowfully. \"Though if it hadn't blown us this  far, we might have come to grief over the ocean, and be floundering  in that, instead of on dry land.\"    \"That's so,\" agreed Mr. Fenwick, who was carefully feeling of some  bruises on his legs. \"I wonder where we are, anyhow?\"    \"I haven't the least idea,\" responded Tom. \"It's an island, but  which one, or where it is I don't know. We were blown nearly two  thousand miles, I judge.\"    He walked over and surveyed the wreck. Now that the excitement was  over he was beginning to be aware of numerous bruises and  contusions, His legs felt rather queer, and on rolling up his  trousers he found there was a deep cut in the right shin, just below  his knee. It was bleeding, but he bandaged it with a spare  handkerchief, and walked on.    Peering about, he saw that nearly the whole of the machinery in the  engine room, including most of the electrical apparatus, had fallen  bodily through the floor, and now rested on the sand.    \"That looks to be in pretty good shape.\" mused Tom, \"but it's a  question whether it will ever be any good to us. We can't rebuild  the airship here, that's certain.\"    He walked about the wreck, and then returned to his friends. Mr.  Damon was more like himself, and Mr. Fenwick had discovered that he  had only minor bruises.    \"Bless my coffee cup!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"I declare, I feel  hungry. I wonder if there's anything left to eat in the wreck?\"    \"Plenty,\" spoke Tom, cheerfully. \"I'll get it out. I can eat a  sandwich or too myself, and perhaps I can set up the gasolene stove,  and cook something.\"    As the young inventor was returning to the wreck, he was halted  halfway by a curious trembling feeling. At first he thought it was a  weakness of his legs, caused by his cut, but a moment later he  realized with a curious, sickening sensation that it was the ground--the  island itself--that was shaking and trembling.    The lad turned back. Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick were staring after  him with fear showing on their faces.    \"What was that?\" cried the inventor.    \"Bless my gizzard! Did you feel that, Tom?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"The  whole place is shaking!\"    Indeed, there was a stronger tremor now, and it was accompanied by a  low, rumbling sound, like distant thunder. The adventurers were  swaying to and fro.    Suddenly they were tossed to the ground by a swaying motion, and not  far off a great crack opened in the earth. The roaring, rumbling  sound increased in volume.    \"An earthquake! It's an earthquake!\" cried Tom. \"We're in the midst  of an earthquake!\"          CHAPTER XIV    A NIGHT IN CAMP      The rumbling and roaring continued for perhaps two minutes, during  which time the castaways found it impossible to stand, for the  island was shaking under their feet with a sickening motion. Off to  one side there was a great fissure in the earth, and, frightened as  he was, Tom looked to see if it was extending in their direction.    If it was, or if a crack opened near them, they might be  precipitated into some bottomless abyss, or into the depths of the  sea. But the fissure did not increase in length or breadth, and,  presently the rumbling, roaring sound subsided. The island grew  quiet and the airship travelers rose to their feet.    \"Bless my very existence! What happened?\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"It was an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4230"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle; Or, Fun and Adventures on the Road (#13)"],[1,"later had come to a stop beneath the shed. It was broad and  long, furnishing a good protection against the storm, which had now  burst in all its fury.    Tom was not very wet, and looking to see that the model, which was  partly of wood, had suffered no damage, the lad gave his attention  to his machine.    \"Seems to be all right,\" he murmured. \"I'll just oil her up while  I'm waiting. This can't last long; it's raining too hard.\"    He busied himself over the motor-cycle, adjusting a nut that had  been rattled loose, and putting some oil on the bearings. The rain  kept up steadily, and when he had completed his attentions to his  machine Tom looked out from under the protection of the shed.    \"It certainly is coming down for keeps,\" he murmured. \"This trip is  a regular hoodoo so far. Hope I have it better coming back.\"    As he looked down the road he espied an automobile coming through  the mist of rain. It was an open car, and as he saw the three men in  it huddled up under the insufficient protection of some blankets,  Tom said:    \"They'd ought to come in here. There's lots of room. Maybe they  don't see it. I'll call to them.\"    The car was almost opposite the shed which was close to the roadside.  Tom was about to call when one of the men in the auto looked up. He  saw the shelter and spoke to the chauffeur. The latter was preparing  to steer up into the shed when the two men on the rear seat caught  sight of Tom.    \"Why, that's the same car that passed me a while ago,\" said the  young inventor half aloud. \"The one that contained those men whom I  suspected might be after dad's patent. I hope they--\"    He did not finish his sentence, for at that instant the chauffeur  quickly swung the machine around and headed it back into the road.  Clearly the men were not going to take advantage of the shelter of  the shed.    \"That's mighty strange,\" murmured Tom. \"They certainly saw me, and  as soon as they did they turned away. Can they be afraid of me?\"    He went to the edge of the shelter and peered out. The auto had  disappeared down the road behind a veil of rain, and, shaking his  head over the strange occurrence, Tom went back to where he had left  his motor-cycle.    \"Things are getting more and more muddled,\" he said. \"I'm sure those  were the same men, and yet--\"    He shrugged his shoulders. The puzzle was getting beyond him.          CHAPTER XIV.    ATTACKED FROM BEHIND      Steadily the rain came down, the wind driving it under the shed  until Tom was hard put to find a place where the drops would not  reach him. He withdrew into a far corner, taking his motor-cycle with  him, and then, sitting on a block of wood, under the rough mangers  where the horses were fed while the farmers attended church, the lad  thought over the situation. He could make little of it, and the more  he tried the worse it seemed to become. He looked out across the wet  landscape.    \"I wonder if this is ever going to stop?\" he mused. \"It looks as if  it was in for an all-day pour, yet we ought only to have a summer  shower by rights.\"    \"But then I guess what I think about it won't influence the weather  man a bit. I might as well make myself comfortable, for I can't do  anything. Let's see. If I get to Fordham by six o'clock I ought to  be able to make Albany by nine, as it's only forty miles. I'll get  supper in Fordham, and push on. That is, I will if the rain stops.\"    That was the most necessary matter to have happen first, and Tom  arising from his seat strolled over to the front of the shed to look  out.    \"I believe it is getting lighter in the west,\" he told himself.  \"Yes, the clouds are lifting. It's going to clear. It's only a  summer shower, after all.\"    But just as he said that there came a sudden squall of wind and  rain, fiercer than any which had preceded. Tom was driven back to  his seat on the log. It was quite chilly now, and he noticed that  near where he sat there was a big opening in the rear of the shed,  where a couple of boards were off.    \"This must be a draughty place in winter,\" he observed. \"If I could  find a drier spot I'd sit there, but this seems to be the best,\" and  he remained there, musing on many things. Suddenly in the midst of  his thoughts he imagined he heard the sound of an automobile  approaching. \"I wonder if those men are coming back here?\" he  exclaimed. \"If they are--\"    The youth again arose, and went to the front of the shed. He could  see nothing, and came back to escape the rain. There was no doubt  but that the shower would soon be over, and looking at his watch,  Tom began to calculate when he might arrive in Albany.    He was busy trying to figure out the best plan to pursue, and was  hardly conscious of his surroundings. Seated on the log, with his  back to the opening in the shed, the young inventor could not see a  figure stealthily creeping up through the wet grass. Nor could he  see an automobile, which had come to a stop back of the horse  shelter--an automobile containing two rain-soaked men, who were  anxiously watching the one stealing through the grass.    Tom put his watch back into his pocket and looked out into the  storm. It was almost over. The sun was trying to shine through the  clouds, and only a few drops were falling. The youth stretched with  a yawn, for he was tired of sitting still. At the moment when he  raised his arms to relieve his muscles something was thrust through  the opening behind him. It was a long club, and an instant later it  descended on the lad's head. He went down in a heap, limp and  motionless.    Through the opening leaped a man. He bent over Tom, looked anxiously  at him, and then, stepping to the place where the boards were off  the shed, he motioned to the men in the automobile.    They hurried from the machine, and were soon beside their companion.    \"I knocked him out, all right,\" observed the man who had reached  through and dealt Tom the blow with the club.    \"Knocked him out! I should say you did, Featherton!\" exclaimed one  who appeared better dressed than the others. \"Have you killed him?\"    \"No; but I wish you wouldn't mention my name, Mr. Appleson. I--I  don't like--\"    \"Nonsense, Featherton. No one can hear us. But I'm afraid you've  done for the chap. I didn't want him harmed.\"    \"Oh, I guess Featherton knows how to do it, Appleson,\" commented the  third man. \"He's had experience that way, eh, Featherton?\"    \"Yes, Mr. Morse; but if you please I wish you wouldn't mention--\"    \"All right, Featherton, I know what you mean,\" rejoined the man  addressed as Morse. \"Now let's see if we have drawn a blank or not.  I think he has with him the very thing we want.\"    \"Doesn't seem to be about his person,\" observed Appleson, as he  carefully felt about the clothing of the unfortunate Tom.    \"Very likely not. It's too bulky. But there's his motor-cycle over  there. It looks as if what we wanted was on the back of the saddle.  Jove, Featherton, but I think he's coming to!\"    Tom stirred uneasily and moved his arms, while a moan came from  between his parted lips.    \"I've got some stuff that will fix him!\" exclaimed the man addressed  as Featherton, and who had been operating the automobile. He took  something from his pocket and leaned over Tom. In a moment the young  inventor was still again.    \"Quick now, see if it's there,\" directed Morse, and Appleson hurried  over to the machine.    \"Here it is!\" he called. \"I'll take it to our car, and we can get  away.\"    \"Are you going to leave him here like this?\" asked Morse.    \"Yes; why not?\"    \"Because some one might have seen him come in here, and also  remember that we, too, came in this direction.\"    \"What would you do?\"    \"Take him down the road a way and leave him. We can find some shed  near a farmhouse where he and his machine will be out of sight until  we get far enough away. Besides, I don't like to leave him so far  from help, unconscious as he is.\"    \"Oh, you're getting chicken-hearted,\" said Appleson with a sneer.  \"However, have your way about it. I wonder what has become of Jake  Burke? He was to meet us in Centreford, but he did not show up.\"    \"Oh, I shouldn't be surprised if he had trouble in that tramp rig he  insisted on adopting. I told him he was running a risk, but he said  he had masqueraded as a tramp before.\"    \"So he has. He's pretty good at it. Now, Simpson, if you will--\"    \"Not Simpson! I thought you agreed to call me Featherton,\"  interrupted the chauffeur, turning to Morse and Appleson.    \"Oh, so we did. I forgot that this lad met us one day, and heard me  call you Simpson,\" admitted Morse. \"Well, Featherton it shall be.  But we haven't much time. It's stopped raining, and the roads will  soon be well traveled. We must get away, and if we are to take the  lad and his machine to some secluded place, we'd better be at it. No  use waiting for Burke. He can look out after himself. Anyhow, we  have the model now, and there's no use in him hanging around Swift's  shop, as he intended to do, waiting for a chance to sneak in after  it. Appleson, if you and Simpson--I mean Featherton--will carry  young Swift, I'll shove his wheel along to the auto, and we can put  it and him in.\"    The two men, first looking through the hole in the shed to make sure  they were not observed, went out, carrying Tom, who was no light  load. Morse followed them, pushing the motor-cycle, and carrying  under one arm the bundle containing the valuable model, which he had  detached.    \"I think this is the time we get ahead of Mr. Swift,\" murmured  Morse, pulling his black mustache, when he and his companions had  reached the car in the field. \"We have just what we want now.\"    \"Yes, but we had hard enough work getting it,\" observed Appleson.  \"Only by luck we saw this lad come in here, or we would have had to  chase all over for him, and maybe then we would have missed him.  Hurry, Simpson--I mean Featherton. It's getting late, and we've"]]]
