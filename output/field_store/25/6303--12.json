They evidently imagine that the issue from every  prison must be there where the light shines clearest; and they act  in accordance, and persist in too logical action. To them glass is a  supernatural mystery they never have met with in nature; they have  had no experience of this suddenly impenetrable atmosphere; and, the  greater their intelligence, the more inadmissible, more  incomprehensible, will the strange obstacle appear. Whereas the  featherbrained flies, careless of logic as of the enigma of crystal,  disregarding the call of the light, flutter wildly hither and  thither, and, meeting here the good fortune that often waits on the  simple, who find salvation there where the wiser will perish,  necessarily end by discovering the friendly opening that restores  their liberty to them.    The same naturalist cites yet another proof of the bees' lack of  intelligence, and discovers it in the following quotation from the  great American apiarist, the venerable and paternal Langstroth:--    \"As the fly was not intended to banquet on blossoms, but on  substances in which it might easily be drowned, it cautiously  alights on the edge of any vessel containing liquid food, and warily  helps itself; while the poor bee, plunging in headlong, speedily  perishes. The sad fate of their unfortunate companions does not in  the least deter others who approach the tempting lure from madly  alighting on the bodies of the dying and the dead, to share the same  miserable end. No one can understand the extent of their infatuation  until he has seen a confectioner's shop assailed by myriads of  hungry bees. I have seen thousands strained out from the syrups in  which they had perished; thousands more alighting even on the  boiling sweets; the floors covered and windows darkened with bees,  some crawling, others flying, and others still so completely  besmeared as to be able neither to crawl nor to fly--not one in ten  able to carry home its ill-gotten spoils, and yet the air filled  with new hosts of thoughtless comers.\"    This, however, seems to me no more conclusive than might be the  spectacle of a battlefield, or of the ravages of alcoholism, to a  superhuman observer bent on establishing the limits of human  understanding. Indeed, less so, perhaps; for the situation of the  bee, when compared with our own, is strange in this world. It was  intended to live in the midst of an indifferent and unconscious  nature, and not by the side of an extraordinary being who is forever  disturbing the most constant laws, and producing grandiose,  inexplicable phenomena. In the natural order of things, in the  monotonous life of the forest, the madness Langstroth describes  would be possible only were some accident suddenly to destroy a hive  full of honey. But in this case, even, there would be no fatal  glass, no boiling sugar or cloying syrup; no death or danger,  therefore, other than that to which every animal is exposed while  seeking its prey.    Should we be more successful than they in preserving our presence of  mind if some strange power were at every step to ensnare our reason?  Let us not be too hasty in condemning the bees for the folly whereof  we are the authors, or in deriding their intellect, which is as  poorly equipped to foil our artifices as our own would be to foil  those of some superior creature unknown to us to-day, but on that  account not impossible. None such being known at present, we  conclude that we stand on the topmost pinnacle of life on this  earth; but this belief, after all, is by no means infallible. I am  not assuming that when our actions are unreasonable, or  contemptible, we merely fall into the snares that such a creature  has laid; though it is not inconceivable that this should one day be  proved true. On the other hand, it cannot be wise to deny  intelligence to the bee because it has not yet succeeded in  distinguishing us from the great ape or the bear. It is certain that  there are, in us and about us, influences and powers no less  dissimilar whose distinction escapes us as readily.    And finally, to end this apology, wherein I seem somewhat to have  fallen into the error I laid to Sir John Lubbock's charge, does not  the capacity for folly so great in itself argue intelligence? For  thus it is ever in the uncertain domain of the intellect, apparently  the most vacillating and precarious condition of matter. The same  light that falls on the intellect falls also on passion, whereof  none can tell whether it be the smoke of the flame or the wick. In  the case above it has not been mere animal desire to gorge  themselves with honey that has urged on the bees. They could do this  at their leisure in the store-rooms at home. Watch them in an  analogous circumstance; follow them; you will see that, as soon as  their sac is filled, they will return to the hive and add their  spoil to the general store; and visit the marvellous vintage, and  leave it, perhaps thirty times in an hour. Their admirable labours,  therefore, are inspired by a single desire: zeal to bring as much  wealth as they can to the home of their sisters, which is also the  home of the future. When we discover a cause as disinterested for  the follies of men, we are apt to call them by another name.    {44}    However, the whole truth must be told. In the midst of the marvels  of their industry, their policy, their sacrifice, one thing exists  that must always check and weaken our admiration; and this is the  indifference with which they regard the misfortunes or death of  their comrades. There is a strange duality in the character of the  bee. In the heart of the hive all help and love each other. They are  as united as the good thoughts that dwell in the same soul. Wound  one of them, and a thousand will sacrifice themselves to avenge its  injury. But outside the hive they no longer recognise each other.  Mutilate them, crush them,--or rather, do nothing of the kind; it  would be a useless cruelty, for the fact is established beyond any  doubt,--but were you to mutilate, or crush, on a piece of comb  placed a few steps from their dwelling, twenty or thirty bees that  have all issued from the same hive, those you have left untouched  will not even turn their heads. With their tongue, fantastic as a  Chinese weapon, they will tranquilly continue to absorb the liquid  they hold more precious than life, heedless of the agony whose last  gestures almost are touching them, of the cries of distress that  arise all around. And when the comb is empty, so great is their  anxiety that nothing shall be lost, that their eagerness to gather  the honey which clings to the victims will induce them tranquilly to  climb over dead and dying, unmoved by the presence of the first and  never dreaming of helping the others. In this case, therefore, they  have no notion of the danger they run, seeing that they are wholly  untroubled by the death that is scattered about them, and they have  not the slightest sense of solidarity or pity. As regards the  danger, the explanation lies ready to hand; the bees know not the  meaning of fear, and, with the exception only of smoke, are afraid  of nothing in the world. Outside the hive, they display extreme  condescension and forbearance. They will avoid whatever disturbs  them, and affect to ignore its existence, so long as it come not too  close; as though aware that this universe belongs to all, that each  one has his place there, and must needs be discreet and peaceful.  But beneath this indulgence is quietly hidden a heart so sure of  itself that it never dreams of protesting. If they are threatened,  they will alter their course, but never attempt to escape. In the  hive, however, they will not confine themselves to this passive  ignoring of peril. They will spring with incredible fury on any  living thing, ant or lion or man, that dares to profane the sacred  ark. This we may term anger, ridiculous obstinacy, or heroism,  according as our mind be disposed.    But of their want of solidarity outside the hive, and even of  sympathy within it, I can find nothing to say. Are we to believe  that each form of intellect possesses its own strange limitation,  and that the tiny flame which with so much difficulty at last burns  its way through inert matter and issues forth from the brain, is  still so uncertain that if it illumine one point more strongly the  others are forced into blacker darkness? Here we find that the bees  (or nature acting within them) have organised work in common, the  love and cult of the future, in a manner more perfect than can  elsewhere be discovered. Is it for this reason that they have lost  sight of all the rest? They give their love to what lies ahead of  them; we bestow ours on what is around. And we who love here,  perhaps, have no love left for what is beyond. Nothing varies so  much as the direction of pity or charity. We ourselves should  formerly have been far less shocked than we are to-day at the  insensibility of the bees; and to many an ancient people such  conduct would not have seemed blameworthy. And further, can we tell  how many of the things that we do would shock a being who might be  watching us as we watch the bees?          IV -- THE LIFE OF THE BEE    {45}    LET us now, in order to form a clearer conception of the bees'  intellectual power, proceed to consider their methods of  inter-communication. There can be no doubting that they understand  each other; and indeed it were surely impossible for a republic so  considerable, wherein the labours are so varied and so marvellously  combined, to subsist amid the silence and spiritual isolation of so  many thousand creatures. They must be able, therefore, to give  expression to thoughts and feelings, by means either of a phonetic  vocabulary or more probably of some kind of tactile"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#13)"],[1,"explicit:        \"For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of      allowance;        \"Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the      Lord shall be forgiven;        \"And he that repents not, from him shall be taken even the light      which he has received, for my Spirit shall not always strive with      man, saith the Lord of Hosts.\"[6]    The Latter-day Saints believe and teach that repentance {68} will  be possible, and indeed required to the yet unrepentant, even after  death; and they affirm that this doctrine is supported by scripture  both ancient and modern. We read that while the body of our Lord lay  in the tomb, between the evening of the day of crucifixion and the  glorious resurrection morn, He was engaged in ministerial labor in the  world of disembodied spirits. Peter specifically declares that our  Lord \"went and preached unto the spirits in prison; which sometime  were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the  days of Noah.\"[7] The context with which appear these words of the  inspired apostle, shows that the event referred to occurred prior to  the Savior's resurrection. Furthermore, it will be remembered that one  of the condemned malefactors, whose cross of death stood alongside  that of Jesus, manifested faith and even some degree of repentance,  and received from the suffering Christ the benediction and assurance  \"Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise.\"[8] It cannot be maintained  that this promise implied the passing of the repentant sinner directly  from the cross into Heaven--the abode of the redeemed in the presence  of God; for surely there had been no opportunity for the suffering  penitent to put his repentance into effect by complying with the  established laws and ordinances of the Gospel, and without such  compliance, even as to the single requirement of water-baptism alone,  the man could neither enter nor see the Kingdom of God, or the word of  Christ would have been proven false.[9] Moreover, as conclusive proof  of the fact that between the time of Christ's death and resurrection,  neither He nor the contrite {69} sinner had gone to the abode of God,  we have the words of the Risen Lord to the sorrowing Magdalene: \"I am  not yet ascended to my Father.\"[10]    In view of scriptural affirmation that the disembodied Christ did visit  and minister among the spirits who had been disobedient, and who,  because of unpardoned sin were still held in duress, it is pertinent to  inquire as to the scope and object of our Savior's ministry among them.  His preaching must have been purposeful and positive; moreover, it is  not to be assumed that His message was other than one of relief and  mercy. Those to whom He went were already in prison, and had been there  long. To them came the Redeemer, to preach, not to further condemn,  to open the way that led to light, not to intensify the darkness of  despair in which they languished. Had not that visit of deliverance  been long predicted? Centuries before that fateful time Isaiah had  prophesied of proud and wicked spirits: \"And they shall be gathered  together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in  the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.\"[11] And again,  referring to the appointed ministry of the Christ, the same inspired  voice of prophecy declared part of that work to be \"to open the blind  eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in  darkness out of the prison house.\"[12] David, filled with the emotions  of contrition and hope, sang in measures of mingled sadness and joy:  \"Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also  shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell.\"[13]    {70} From these and other scriptures we learn that the ministry of  Christ was not confined to the few who lived in mortality during the  short period of His earthly life, nor to them and the generations  then future; but to all, dead, living, and yet unborn. It cannot be  denied that myriads had lived and died before the meridian of time,  and of these multitudes, as of the many since born, unnumbered hosts  have died without a knowledge of the Gospel and its prescribed plan of  salvation. What is their condition, as indeed what shall be the state  of the present inhabitants of earth, and of the multitudes yet future,  who shall die in ignorance and without the faith that saves? Let us ask  again, how can those who know not Christ have faith in Him, and how,  while lacking both knowledge and faith can they avail themselves of the  provision made for their salvation?    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints affirms that the  plan of salvation is not bounded by the grave; but that the Gospel  is deathless and everlasting, reaching back into the ages that have  gone, and forward into the eternities of the future. The ministry  of the Savior among the dead doubtless included the revelation of  His own atoning death, the inculcation of faith in Himself and in  the divinely-appointed plan He represented, and the necessity of a  repentance acceptable unto God. It is reasonable to believe that the  other essential requirements comprised within the _laws and ordinances  of the Gospel_ were made known.    To the less thoughtful reader it may appear that to teach the  possibility of repentance beyond the grave may tend to weaken belief  in the absolute necessity of repentance and reformation in this life.  A careful consideration {71} of the matter, however, will show that  this doctrine affords no reason for such objection. To reject or ignore  in any degree a gift of God is to forfeit to the corresponding extent  one's claim upon that gift. To the soul that has wilfully neglected the  opportunities for repentance here offered, repentance in the hereafter  may be, and indeed it is reasonable to believe will be, so difficult as  to be long unattainable. This conception is justified by scripture, as  witness the words of Amulek, a Nephite prophet, who thus admonished the  Church on the western continent four score years before the birth of  Christ:        \"For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God;      * * * therefore, I beseech of you, that ye do not procrastinate the      day of your repentance until the end; * * * Ye cannot say, when ye      are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will      return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit      which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this      life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that      eternal world. For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of      your repentance, even until death, behold, ye have become subjected      to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his.\"[14]    _Baptism by water_ is taught by the Church in this dispensation as an  essential ordinance of the Gospel. Baptism is the gateway leading into  the fold of Christ, the portal to the Church, the established rite  of naturalization in the Kingdom of God. The candidate for admission  into the Church, having obtained and professed faith in the Lord Jesus  Christ, and having sincerely repented of his sins, is properly required  to give evidence of this spiritual sanctification by some outward  ordinance, prescribed {72} by authority as the sign or symbol of the  new profession. The initiatory ordinance is baptism by water, to be  followed by the higher baptism of the Holy Spirit; and, as a result of  this act of obedience, remission of sins is granted.[15]    That baptism is essential to salvation is attested by many specific  scriptures; yet even without such its essentiality appears in view of  the unconditional requirement of repentance, and the evident fact that  to be of value and effect repentance must imply obedience to the Divine  requirements, which include baptism by water. Be it remembered that  Jesus, the Christ, though untouched by the taint of sin, submitted in  person to this ordinance, which was administered by the Baptist in the  waters of Jordan. The burden of John's teaching was \"Repent ye; for the  kingdom of heaven is at hand,\" and to such as came to him professing  repentance he administered baptism by water immersion. Then came Jesus  unto John, to be baptized of him; and the Baptist, regarding Him as one  without sin, demurred, saying:        \"I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?        \"And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for      thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered      him.        \"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the      water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the      Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:        \"And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in      whom I am well pleased.\"[16]    {73} It is evident from the foregoing that the baptism of Jesus was  acceptable unto the Father, and was by Him characterized as an act of  humility and obedience on the part of the Son, with which He was well  pleased. Some time after His own baptism Jesus affirmed, in words at  once forceful and unequivocal, that baptism is required of all men as  a condition of entrance into the kingdom of God. To Nicodemus, a ruler  among the Jews, who came by night professing some measure of faith,  Jesus said: \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of  water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[17]  When in the resurrected state He manifested Himself to the apostles,  He instructed them by way of final and special commission: \"Go ye  therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the  Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\"[18] The necessity and  purpose of the ordinance appear in His further words on the same solemn  occasion: \"He"]]]
