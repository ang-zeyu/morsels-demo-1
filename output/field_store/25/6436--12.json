OAKLEY      Betty, when she stepped on board the boat for Marseilles, had had no  definite plan of action. She had been caught up and swept away by an  over-mastering desire for escape that left no room in her mind for  thoughts of the morrow. It was not till the train was roaring its way  across southern France that she found herself sufficiently composed to  review her position and make plans.    She would not go back. She could not. The words she had used in her  letter to Mr. Scobell were no melodramatic rhetoric. They were a plain  and literal statement of the truth. Death would be infinitely  preferable to life at Mervo on her stepfather's conditions.    But, that settled, what then? What was she to do? The gods are  businesslike. They sell; they do not give. And for what they sell they  demand a heavy price. We may buy life of them in many ways: with our  honor, our health, our independence, our happiness, with our brains or  with our hands. But somehow or other, in whatever currency we may  choose to pay it, the price must be paid.    Betty faced the problem. What had she? What could she give? Her  independence? That, certainly. She saw now what a mockery that fancied  independence had been. She had come and gone as she pleased, her path  smoothed by her stepfather's money, and she had been accustomed to  consider herself free. She had learned wisdom now, and could understand  that it was only by sacrificing such artificial independence that she  could win through to freedom. The world was a market, and the only  independent people in it were those who had a market value.    What was her market value? What could she do? She looked back at her  life, and saw that she had dabbled. She had a little of most  things--enough of nothing. She could sketch a little, play a little,  sing a little, write a little. Also--and, as she remembered it, she  felt for the first time a tremor of hope--she could use a typewriter  reasonably well. That one accomplishment stood out in the welter of her  thoughts, solid and comforting, like a rock in a quicksand. It was  something definite, something marketable, something of value for which  persons paid.    The tremor of hope did not comfort her long. Her mood was critical, and  she saw that in this, her one accomplishment, she was, as in everything  else, an amateur. She could not compete against professionals. She  closed her eyes, and had a momentary vision of those professionals,  keen of face, leathern of finger, rattling out myriads of words at a  dizzy speed. And, at that, all her courage suddenly broke; she drooped  forlornly, and, hiding her face on the cushioned arm-rest, she began to  cry.    Tears are the Turkish bath of the soul. Nature never intended woman to  pass dry-eyed through crises of emotion. A casual stranger, meeting  Betty on her way to the boat, might have thought that she looked a  little worried,--nothing more. The same stranger, if he had happened to  enter the compartment at this juncture, would have set her down at  sight as broken-hearted beyond recovery. Yet such is the magic of tears  that it was at this very moment that Betty was beginning to be  conscious of a distinct change for the better. Her heart still ached,  and to think of John even for an instant was to feel the knife turning  in the wound, but her brain was clear; the panic fear had gone, and she  faced the future resolutely once more. For she had just remembered the  existence of Mrs. Oakley.           *       *       *       *       *    Only once in her life had Betty met her stepfather's celebrated aunt,  and the meeting had taken place nearly twelve years ago. The figure  that remained in her memory was of a pale-eyed, grenadier-like old  lady, almost entirely surrounded by clocks. It was these clocks that  had impressed her most. She was too young to be awed by the knowledge  that the tall old woman who stared at her just like a sandy cat she had  once possessed was one of the three richest women in the whole wide  world. She only remembered thinking that the finger which emerged from  the plaid shawl and prodded her cheek was unpleasantly bony. But the  clocks had absorbed her. It was as if all the clocks in the world had  been gathered together into that one room. There had been big clocks,  with almost human faces; small, perky clocks; clocks of strange shape;  and one dingy, medium-sized clock in particular which had made her cry  out with delight. Her visit had chanced to begin shortly before eleven  in the morning, and she had not been in the room ten minutes before  there was a whirring, and the majority of the clocks began to announce  the hour, each after its own fashion--some with a slow bloom, some with  a rapid, bell-like sound. But the medium-sized clock, unexpectedly  belying its appearance of being nothing of particular importance, had  performed its task in a way quite distinct from the others. It had  suddenly produced from its interior a shabby little gold man with a  trumpet, who had blown eleven little blasts before sliding backward  into his house and shutting the door after him. Betty had waited in  rapt silence till he finished, and had then shouted eagerly for more.    Just as the beginner at golf may effect a drive surpassing that of the  expert, so may a child unconsciously eclipse the practised courtier.  There was no soft side to Mrs. Oakley's character, as thousands of  suave would-be borrowers had discovered in their time, but there was a  soft spot. To general praise of her collection of clocks she was  impervious; it was unique, and she did not require you to tell her so,  but exhibit admiration for the clock with the little trumpeter, and she  melted. It was the one oasis of sentiment in the Sahara of her mental  outlook, the grain of radium in the pitchblende. Years ago it had stood  in a little New England farmhouse, and a child had clapped her hands  and shouted, even as Betty had done, when the golden man slid from his  hiding-place. Much water had flowed beneath the bridge since those  days. Many things had happened to the child. But she still kept her old  love for the trumpeter. The world knew nothing of this. The world, if  it had known, would have been delighted to stand before the clock and  admire it volubly, by the day. But it had no inkling of the trumpeter's  importance, and, when it came to visit Mrs. Oakley, was apt to waste  its time showering compliments on the obvious beauties of the queens of  the collection.    But Betty, ignoring these, jumped up and down before the dingy clock,  demanding further trumpetings, and, turning to Mrs. Oakley, as one  possessing influence, she was aware of a curious, intent look in the  old lady's eyes.    \"Do you like that clock, my dear?\" said Mrs. Oakley.    \"Yes! Oh, yes!\"    \"Perhaps you shall have it some day, honey.\"    Betty was probably the only person who had been admitted to that room  who would not, on the strength of this remark, have steered the  conversation gently to the subject of a small loan. Instead, she ran to  the old lady, and kissed her. And, as to what had happened after that,  memory was vague. There had been some talk, she remembered, of a dollar  to buy candy, but it had come to nothing, and now that she had grown  older and had read the frequent paragraphs and anecdotes that appeared  in the papers about her stepfather's aunt, she could understand why.  She knew now what everybody knew of Mrs. Oakley--her history, her  eccentricities, and the miserliness of which the papers spoke with a  satirical lightness that seemed somehow but a thin disguise for what  was almost admiration.    Mrs. Oakley was one of two children, a son and a daughter, of a Vermont  farmer. Of her early life no records remain. Her public history begins  when she was twenty-two and came to New York. After two years'  struggling, she found a position in the firm of one Redgrave. Those who  knew her then speak of her as a tall, handsome girl, hard and intensely  ambitious. From contemporary accounts she seems to have out-Nietzsched  Nietzsche. Nietzsche's vision stopped short at the superman. Jane  Scobell was a superwoman. She had all the titanic selfishness and  indifference to the comfort of others which marks the superman, and, in  addition, undeniable good looks and a knowledge of the weaknesses of  men. Poor Mr. Redgrave had not had a chance from the start. She married  him within a year. Two years later, catching the bulls in an unguarded  moment, Mr. Redgrave despoiled them of a trifle over three million  dollars, and died the same day of an apoplectic stroke caused by the  excitement of victory. His widow, after a tour in Europe, returned to  the United States and visited Pittsburg. Any sociologist will support  the statement that it is difficult, almost impossible, for an  attractive widow, visiting Pittsburg, not to marry a millionaire, even  if she is not particularly anxious to do so. If such an act is the  primary object of her visit, the thing becomes a certainty. Groping  through the smoke, Jane Redgrave seized and carried off no less a  quarry than Alexander Baynes Oakley, a widower, whose income was one of  the seven wonders of the world. In the fullness of time he, too, died,  and Jane Oakley was left with the sole control of two vast fortunes.    She did not marry again, though it was rumored that it took three  secretaries, working nine hours a day, to cope with the written  proposals, and that butler after butler contracted clergyman's sore  throat through denying admittance to amorous callers. In the ten years  after Alexander Baynes' death, every impecunious aristocrat in the  civilized world must have made his dash for the matrimonial pole. But  her pale eyes looked them over, and dismissed them.    During those early years she was tempted once or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6971"],[0,"Judaism (#13)"],[1," moulded human destiny?    A favourite answer is: Judaism is the exception that proves the rule. It  _has_ been a permanent force in the world's history. It is argued  that Jewish ideals have exercised recurrent influence at all important  crises. Dr. Guttmann somewhat rhetorically makes this identical claim. He  points to the birth of Christianity, the rise of Islam, the mediaeval  Scholasticism, the Italian Renaissance, the German Reformation, the  English and American Puritanism, the modern humanitarian movement, as  exemplifications of the continued power of Judaism to mould the minds  and souls of men. There is a sense in which this claim is just. It  is a valuable support to the Jew's allegiance to Judaism. But even if  Dr. Guttmann's claim were granted, and it is considerably exaggerated,  how does it help? We are all agreed as to the debt which the world owes  to Greece. That debt is a great one. Is it obsolete? Surely not. Greece  has again and again revived its ancient power to inspire men. The  world would be a poor one to-day without all that Greek culture stands  for. Greece did not give men enough to live by; Hebraism did that. But  Greece made life more worth living. Hellenism is an ever-recurrent  force in human civilisation. Yet no one argues that because Hellenism  is still necessary, Hellenes are also necessary. Who contends that for  carrying on Greek culture you need Greeks? On the contrary, it was the  case of Greece that gave rise to the profound observation that just as  a man must die to live, so peoples must die that men may live through  them. Renan, who, among the moderns, gave fullest value to this truth,  included Judaea with Greece in the generalisation. Certainly as a nation,  whether temporarily or irrevocably, Judaea perished no less than Athens,  that a new world might be born. And a new Jewish nation would no more  be the old Judaea of Isaiah than the Athens of to-day is the Athens of  Pericles, or the Rome of to-day the Rome of Augustus. History does not  retrace its steps.    Athens fell, and with it the Athenians. Why then, when Judaea fell, did  the Jews remain? Greek culture does not need Greeks to carry it on;  why does Jewish culture need Jews? The first suggestion to be offered  is this:--Israel is the protestant people. Every religious or moral  innovator has also been a protestant. Socrates, Jesus, Luther; Isaiah,  Maimonides, Spinoza; all of them, besides their contributions--very  unequal contributions--to the positive store of truth, assumed also the  negative attitude of protesters. They refused to go with the multitude,  to acquiesce in current conventions. They were all unpopular and even  anti-popular. The Jews as a community have fulfilled, and are fulfilling,  this protestant function. They have been and are unpopular just because  of their protestant function. They refuse to go with the multitude;  they refuse to acquiesce. Geiger used this argument very forcibly,  from the spiritual point of view, in the early part of the nineteenth  century, and Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu (in his book _Israel among the  Nations_) even more forcibly used it at the end of the same century,  from the historical point of view. This ingenious French observer cites  a suspicion that 'the sons of Jacob, as compared with the rest of the  human race, represent a higher state of evolution' (p. 232). No modern  Jew would make so preposterous a claim. But when the same writer sees  in the Jew a _different_ stage of evolution, then he is on the  right tack. Here is a passage which deserves to be quoted again and  again: 'I have little taste, I confess, for uniformity; I leave that  to the Jacobins. My ideal of a nation is not a monolith, nor a bronze  formed at a single casting. It is better that a people should be composed  of diverse elements and of many races. If the Jew differs from us, so  much the better; he is the more likely to bring a little variety into  the flat monotony of our modern civilisation' (p. 261). And the same  argument applies to religions. There is a permanent value to the world  in Israel's determined, protestant attitude. The handful of protestants  who, in Elijah's day, refused to bow to Baal and to kiss him, were the  real saviours of their generation. And though the world to-day is in no  need of such salvation, still the Jew remains the finest exemplification  of the truth that God fulfils Himself in many ways, lest one good custom  should corrupt the world.    Then again, Judaism seems destined to survive because it represents  at once the God-idea and the ethical idea. The liberal Jew, as well as  the orthodox, believes that no other religion does this in the same way  as does Judaism. Putting it crudely, the Jew would perhaps admit that  Christianity has absorbed, developed, enlarged and purified the Hebrew  ethics, but he would, rightly or wrongly, think that it has obscured by  dogmatic accretions the Jewish Monotheism. On the other hand, the Jew  would admit that Islam has absorbed and purified the Jewish Monotheism,  but has done less of the flattery of imitation to the Hebrew ethics. Islam  has certainly a pure creed; it freed itself from the entanglements of  anthropomorphic metaphors and conceptions of God, which are apparent in  the early strata of the Hebrew Bible, and from which Judaism, because  of its reverence for the Bible, has not emancipated itself yet. But that  it can emancipate itself is becoming progressively more clear. And even  if we drop comparisons, Judaism stands for a life in which goodness and  God are the paramount interests.    But, beyond all, the Jew believes himself to be a Witness to God. He  thinks that on him, in some real sense, depends the fulfilment of the  purposes of God. It may be an arrogant thought, but unlike most boasts it  at once humiliates and ennobles, humiliates by the consciousness of what  is, ennobles by the vision of what might be. After enumerating certain  ethical and religious ideas which, he holds, Judaism still has to teach  the world, the Rev. M. Joseph adds: 'But to the Jew himself, first of  all, these truths are uttered. He is to help to win the world for the  highest ideals. But if he is to succeed, he must himself be conspicuously  faithful to them. He is the chosen, but his very election binds him to  vigorous service of truth and righteousness. \"Be ye clean, ye that bear  the vessels of the Lord.\" Only when Israel proves by the nobility of his  life that he deserves his holy vocation will the accomplishment of his  mission be at hand. When all the peoples of the earth shall see that he  is worthily called by the name of the Lord, the Divine name and law will  be near to the attainment of their destined empire over the hearts of men'  (_Judaism as Creed and Life_, p. 513).    A community that believes itself to fill this place in the Divine  purpose deserves to live. Its separate existence is a means, not an end;  for when all has been said, the one God carries with it the idea of one  humanity. The Fatherhood of God implies the brotherhood of man. And so,  amid all its trust that the long travail of centuries cannot fulfil  itself in Israel's annihilation, amid all its particularism, there soars  aloft the belief in the day when there will be no religions, but only  Religion, when Israel will come together with other communions, or they  with Israel. And so, thrice daily, in most Synagogues of Israel, this  prayer is uttered: 'We therefore hope in Thee, O Lord our God, that we  may speedily behold the glory of Thy might, when Thou wilt remove the  abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off;  when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty,  and all the children of flesh will call upon Thy name, when Thou wilt  turn unto Thee all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of  the world perceive and know that unto Thee every knee must bow, every  tongue must swear. Before Thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall;  and unto Thy glorious name let them give honour. Let them all accept  the yoke of Thy kingdom, and do Thou reign over them speedily, and for  ever and ever. For the Kingdom is Thine, and to all eternity Thou wilt  reign in glory; as it is written in Thy Law, The Lord shall reign for  ever and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be King over all the  earth; in that day shall the Lord be One, and His name One.'    Modern Judaism, in short, claims no finality but what is expressed in  that hope. It holds itself ready to develop, to modify, to absorb, to  assimilate, except in so far as such processes seem inconsistent with  this hope. Modern Jews think that in some respects the Rabbinic Judaism  was an advance on the Biblical; they think further that their own modern  Judaism is an advance on the Rabbinic. Judaism, as they conceive it, is  the one religion, with a great history behind it, that does not claim the  religious doctrines of some particular moment in its history to be the  last word on Religion. It thinks that the last word is yet to be spoken,  and is inspired with the confidence that its own continuance will make  that last word fuller and truer when it comes, if it ever does come.
