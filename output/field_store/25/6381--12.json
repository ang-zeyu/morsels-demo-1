Here goes!\" and he opened the oven door and pushed in a pan of  biscuit.    \"Jappy's always ahead in everything,\" grumbled Percy, laboring away at  his dough. \"How in the world do you make the thing roll out straight?  Mine humps up in the middle.\"    \"Put some more flour on the board,\" said Polly, running over to him.  \"There, now see, Percy, if that doesn't roll smooth.\" \"It does with  you,\" said Percy, taking the rolling-pin again, to send it violently  over the long-suffering dough, \"and--I declare, it's going to do with  me,\" he cried, in delight at the large flat cake staring up at him from  the board. \"Now, says I, I'll beat you, Jappy!\" And presently the whole  kitchen resounded with a merry din, as the several cakes and biscuits  were declared almost ready for their respective pans.    \"But, I can tell you, this gingerbread boy is going in next,\" declared  Mr. King from Phronsie's baking-board. \"It's almost done, isn't it,  child?\"    \"Not quite, Grandpapa,\" said Phronsie; \"this eye won't stay in just  like the other. It doesn't look the same way, don't you see?\" pointing  to the currant that certainly showed no inclination to do its duty, as  any well-bred eye should. \"Wait just a moment, please; I'll pull it out  and stick it in again.\"    \"Take another,\" advised the old gentleman, fumbling over the little  heap of currants on the saucer. \"There, here's a good round one, and  very expressive, too, Phronsie.\"    \"That's lovely,\" hummed Phronsie, accepting the new eye with very  sticky fingers. \"Now, he's all ready,\" as she set it in its place, and  took the boy up tenderly. \"Give me a pan, do, Polly.\"    \"Did you cut that out?\" cried Dick, turning around in his chair, and  regarding her enviously, \"all alone by yourself? Didn't Grandpapa help  you just one teeny bit to make the legs and the hands?\"    \"No; she made it all herself,\" said the old gentleman, with justifiable  pride. \"There, Phronsie, here's your pan,\" as Polly set it down before  her with a \"You precious dear, that's perfectly elegant!\"    Phronsie placed the boy within the pan, and gave it many a loving pat.  \"Grandpapa sat here, and looked at it, and smiled,\" she said, turning  her eyes gravely on Dick, \"and that helped ever so much. I couldn't  ever have made it so nice alone. Good-by; now bake like a good boy. Let  me put it in the oven all by myself, do, Polly,\" she begged.    So Phronsie, the old gentleman escorting her in mortal dread that she  would be burned, safely tucked her long pan into the warmest corner,  shut the door, and gravely consulted the clock. \"If I look at it in  twenty-one minutes, I think it will be done,\" she said, \"quite brown.\"    In twenty-one minutes the whole kitchen was as far removed from being  the scene of a baking exploit as was possible. Everything was cleared  away, and set up primly in its place, leaving only a row of fine little  biscuits and cookies, with Phronsie's gingerbread boy in the midst, to  tell the tale of what had been going on. Outside there was a great  commotion.    Deacon Brown's old wagon stood at the gate, for the Peppers and their  friends; and, oh! joy, not the old horse between the shafts, but a  newer and much livelier beast. And on the straw laid in the bottom of  the wagon, the seats being removed, disported all the merry group, Mr.  King alone having the dignity of a chair.    Deacon Brown, delighted with his scheme of bringing the wagon over as a  surprise for the Peppers to take a drive in, was on the side of the  narrow foot-path, chuckling and rubbing his hands together. \"You won't  have to drive so easy as you used to, Ben,\" he called out, \"this  fellow's chirk; give him his head. Sho! what you goin' that way for?\"  as Ben turned off down the lane.    \"To Grandma Bascom's,\" shouted two or three voices.    \"Joel's over there,\" sang out Polly.    \"We couldn't go without him, you know,\" chirped Phronsie, poking a  distressed little face up from the straw heap.    \"'Twould serve him just right if we did,\" said Van. \"He's a great chap  to stay over there like this.\"    \"No--no,\" cried Dick in terror, \"don't go without Joel; I'd rather have  him than any of you,\" he added, not over politely.    Phronsie began to cry piteously at the mere thought of Joel's being  left behind.    \"He wanted to see Mr. Beebe,\" she managed to say, \"and dear Mrs. Beebe.  Oh! don't go without him.\" So Mr. King made them hand her up to him,  and at the risk of their both rolling out, he held her in his lap until  the wagon, stopping at the door of Grandma Bascom's cottage, brought  Joel bounding out with a whoop.    \"Jolly! where'd you get that, and where are you going?\" all in one  breath, as he swung himself up behind.    \"Deacon Brown brought it over just now,\" cried Polly.    \"As a surprise,\" furnished Percy. \"Isn't he a fine old chap? Here's for  the very jolliest go!\"    \"We're going to see dear Mr. Beebe, and dear Mrs. Beebe,\" announced  Phronsie, smiling through her tears, and leaning out of the old  gentleman's lap to nod at him.    \"Hurrah!\" screamed Joel. \"Good-by, Grandma,\" to the old lady, whose  cap-frills were framed in the small window. \"I've had a fine time in  there,\" he condescended to say, but nothing further as to the details  could they extract from him; and so at last they gave it up, and lent  their attention to the various things to be seen as the wagon spun  along. And so over and through the town, and to the very door of the  little shoe-shop, and there, to be sure, was Mr. Beebe the same as  ever, to welcome them; and Joel found to his immense satisfaction that  the stone pot was as full of sugary doughnuts as in the old days; and  Phronsie had her pink and white sticks, and Mrs. Beebe \"Oh-ed\" and  \"Ah-ed\" over them all, and couldn't bear to let them go when at last it  was time to say \"good-by.\" And at last they all climbed into the old  wagon, and were off again on their round of visits.    It was not till the gray dusk of the winter afternoon settled down  unmistakably, so that no one could beg to stay out longer, that they  turned Deacon Brown's horse toward the little brown house.    \"It's going to snow to-morrow, I think,\" observed Jasper, squinting up  at the leaden sky, \"isn't it, father?\"    \"Whoop!\" exclaimed Joel, \"then we will have sport, I tell you!\"    \"It certainly looks like it,\" said old Mr. King, wrapping his fur-lined  coat closer. \"Phronsie, are you sure you are warm enough?\"    \"Yes, Grandpapa dear,\" she answered, curling up deeper in the straw at  his feet.    \"Do you remember how you would carry the red-topped shoes home with  you, Phronsie?\" cried Polly, and then away they rushed again into \"Oh,  don't you remember this, and you haven't forgotten that?\" Jasper as  wildly reminiscent now as the others, for hadn't he almost as good as  lived at the little brown house, pray tell? So the Whitneys looked  curiously on, without a chance to be heard in all the merry chatter;  and then they drew up at the gate of the parsonage, where they were all  to have supper.    When Phronsie woke up in the big bed by the side of her mother the next  morning, Polly was standing over her, and looking down into her face.    \"Oh, Phronsie!\" she exclaimed in great glee, \"the ground is all covered  with snow!\"    \"O--oh!\" screamed Phronsie, her brown eyes flying wide open, \"do give  me my shoes and stockings, Polly, do! I'll be dressed in just  one--minute,\" and thereupon ensued a merry scramble as she tumbled out  of the big bed, and commenced operations, Polly running out to help  Mamsie get the breakfast.    \"Mush seems good now we don't have to eat it,\" cried Joel, as they all  at last sat around the board.    \"'Twas good then,\" said Mrs. Pepper, her black eyes roving over the  faces before her.    \"How funny,\" cried Percy Whitney, who had run over from the parsonage  to breakfast, \"this yellow stuff is.\" And he took up a spoonful of it  gingerly.    \"You don't like it, Percy; don't try to eat it. I'll make you a slice  of toast,\" cried Polly, springing out of her chair, \"in just one  moment.\"    \"No, you mustn't,\" cried Dick, bounding in in time to catch the last  words. \"Mamma said no one was to have anything different, if we came to  breakfast, from what the Peppers are going to eat. I like the yellow  stuff; give me some, do,\" and he slid into a chair and passed his plate  to Mrs. Pepper.    \"So you shall, Dicky,\" she said hastily. \"And you will never taste  sweeter food than this,\" giving him a generous spoonful.    \"Grandpapa is eating ham and fried eggs over at the minister's house,\"  contributed Dick, after satisfying his hunger a bit.    \"Ham and fried eggs!\" exclaimed Mother Pepper, aghast. \"Why, he never  touches them. You must be mistaken, my boy.\"    \"No, I'm not,\" said Dick, obstinately. \"The minister's wife said it  was, and she asked me if I wouldn't have some, and I said I was going  over to the Peppers to breakfast; I'd rather have some of theirs. And  Grandpapa said it was good--the ham and fried eggs was--and he took it  twice; he did, Mrs. Pepper.\"    \"Took it twice?\" she repeated, faintly, with troubled visions of the  future. \"Well, well, the mischief is done now, so there is no use in  talking about it; but I'm worried, all the same.\"    \"Hurry up, Percy,\" called Joel across the table, \"and don't dawdle so.  We're going to make a double ripper, four yards long, to go down that  hill there.\" He laid down his spoon to point out the window at a  distant snow-covered slope.    Percy shivered, but recalling himself in time, said \"Splendid,\" and  addressed himself with difficulty to his mush.    \"Well, you'll never be through at that speed,\" declared Joel. \"See I've  eaten three saucerfuls,\" and he handed his plate up, \"And now for the  fourth, Mamsie.\"    \"Oh! baked potatoes,\" cried Ben, rolling one around in his hand before  he took off its crackling skin. \"Weren't they good, though, with a  little salt. I tell you,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5637"],[0,"Literary and Philosophical Essays: French, German and Italian (#13)"],[1,"y, this way of punishing of children, drawes many  dangerous inconveniences within. How much more decent were it to see  their school-houses and formes strewed with greene boughs and  flowers, than with bloudy burchen-twigs? If it lay in me, I would  doe as the Philosopher Speusippus did, who caused the pictures of  Gladness and Joy, of Flora and of the Graces, to be set up round  about his school-house. Where their profit lieth, there should also  be their recreation. Those meats ought to be sugred over, that are  healthful for childrens stomakes, and those made bitter that are  hurtfull for them. It is strange to see how carefull Plato sheweth  him selfe in framing of his lawes about the recreation and pastime  of the youth of his Citie, and how far he extends him selfe about  their exercises, sports, songs, leaping, and dancing, whereof he  saith, that severe antiquitie gave the conduct and patronage unto  the Gods themselves, namely, to Apollo, to the Muses, and to  Minerva. Marke but how far-forth he endevoreth to give a thousand  precepts to be kept in his places of exercises both of bodie and  mind. As for learned Sciences, he stands not much upon them, and  seemeth in particular to commend Poesie, but for Musickes sake. All  strangenesse and selfe-particularitie in our manners and conditions,  is to be shunned, as an enemie to societie and civill conversation.  Who would not be astonished at Demophons complexion, chiefe steward  of Alexanders household, who was wont to sweat in the shadow, and  quiver for cold in the sunne? I have seene some to startle at the  smell of an apple more than at the shot of a peece; some to be  frighted with a mouse, some readie to cast their gorge [Footnote:  Vomit.] at the sight of a messe of creame, and others to be scared  with seeing a fether bed shaken: as Germanicus, who could not abide  to see a cock, or heare his crowing. There may haply be some hidden  propertie of nature, which in my judgement might easilie be removed,  if it were taken in time. Institution hath gotten this upon me (I  must confesse with much adoe) for, except beere, all things else  that are mans food agree indifferently with my taste. The bodie  being yet souple, ought to be accommodated to all fashions and  customes; and (alwaies provided, his appetites and desires be kept  under) let a yong man boldly be made fit for al Nations and  companies; yea, if need be, for al disorders and surfetings; let him  acquaint him selfe with al fashions; That he may be able to do al  things, and love to do none but those that are commendable. Some  strict Philosophers commend not, but rather blame Calisthenes, for  losing the good favour of his Master Alexander, only because he  would not pledge him as much as he had drunke to him. He shall  laugh, jest, dally, and debauch himselfe with his Prince. And in his  debauching, I would have him out-go al his fellowes in vigor and  constancie, and that he omit not to doe evill, neither for want of  strength or knowledge, but for lacke of will. Multum interest utrum  peccare quis nolit, aut nesciat: [Footnote: HOR. Epist. xvii. 23.]  \"There is a great difference, whether one have no will, or no wit to  doe amisse.\" I thought to have honoured a gentleman (as great a  stranger, and as far from such riotous disorders as any is in  France) by enquiring of him in verie good companie, how many times  in all his life he had bin drunke in Germanie during the time of his  abode there, about the necessarie affaires of our King; who tooke it  even as I meant it, and answered three times, telling the time and  manner how. I know some, who for want of that qualitie, have been  much perplexed when they have had occasion to converse with that  nation. I have often noted with great admiration, that wonderfull  nature of Alcibiades, to see how easilie he could sute himselfe to  so divers fashions and different humors, without prejudice unto his  health; sometimes exceeding the sumptuousnesse and pompe of the  Persians, and now and then surpassing. the austeritie and frugalitie  of the Lacedemonians; as reformed in Sparta, as voluptuous in Ionia.         Omnis Atistippum decuit color, et status, et res.       [Footnote: HOR. Epist. xvii. 25.]         All colours, states, and things are fit       For courtly Aristippus wit.    Such a one would I frame my Disciple,       --quem duplici panno patientia velat,        Mirabor, vita via si conversa decebit.         Whom patience clothes with sutes of double kind,       I muse, if he another way will find.         Personavnque feret non inconcinnus utramque.       [Footnote: CIC. Tusc. Qu. 1. iv.]         He not unfitly may,       Both parts and persons play.    Loe here my lessons, wherein he that acteth them, profiteth more  than he that but knoweth them, whom if you see, you heare, and if  you heare him, you see him. God forbid, saith some bodie in Plato,  that to Philosophize, be to learne many things, and to exercise the  arts. Hanc amplissimam omnium artium bene vivendi disciplinam, vita  magis quant litteris persequntd sunt [Footnote: Ib. 29.] \"This  discipline of living well, which is the amplest of all other arts,  they followed rather in their lives than in their learning or  writing.\" Leo Prince of the Phliasians, enquiring of Heraclides  Ponticus, what art he professed, he answered, \"Sir, I professe  neither art nor science; but I am a Philosopher.\" Some reproved  Diogenes, that being an ignorant man, he did neverthelesse meddle  with Philosophie, to whom he replied, \"So much the more reason have  I and to greater purpose doe I meddle with it.\" Hegesias praid him  upon a time to reade some booke unto him: \"You are a merry man,\"  said he: \"As you chuse naturall and not painted, right and not  counterfeit figges to eat, why doe you not likewise chuse, not the  painted and written, but the true and naturall exercises?\" He shall  not so much repeat, as act his lesson. In his actions shall he make  repetition of the same. We must observe, whether there bee wisdome  in his enterprises, integritie in his demeanor, modestie in his  jestures, justice in his actions, judgement and grace in his speech,  courage in his sicknesse, moderation in his sports, temperance in  his pleasures, order in the government of his house, and  indifference in his taste, whether it be flesh, fish, wine, or  water, or whatsoever he feedeth upon. Qui disciplinam suam non  ostentationem scientiae sed legem vitae putet: quique obtemperet  ipse sibi, et decretis pareat [Footnote: Ib. I. ii.] \"Who thinks his  learning not an ostentation of knowledge, but a law of life, and  himselfe obayes himselfe, and doth what is decreed.\"    The true mirror of our discourses is the course of our lives.  Zeuxidamus answered one that demanded of him, why the Lacedemonians  did not draw into a booke, the ordinances of prowesse, that so their  yong men might read them; \"it is,\" saith he, \"because they would  rather accustome them to deeds and actions, than to bookes and  writings.\" Compare at the end of fifteene or sixteene yeares one of  these collegiall Latinizers, who hath imployed all that while onely  in learning how to speake, to such a one as I meane. The world is  nothing but babling and words, and I never saw man that doth not  rather speake more than he ought, than lesse. Notwithstanding halfe  our age is consumed that way. We are kept foure or five yeares  learning to understand bare words, and to joine them into clauses,  then as long in proportioning a great bodie extended into foure or  five parts; and five more at least ere we can succinctly know how to  mingle, joine, and interlace them handsomly into a subtil fashion,  and into one coherent orbe. Let us leave it to those whose  profession is to doe nothing else. Being once on my journey to  Orleans, it was my chance to meet upon that plaine that lieth on  this side Clery, with two Masters of Arts, traveling toward  Bordeaux, about fiftie paces one from another; far off behind them,  I descride a troupe of horsemen, their Master riding formost, who  was the Earle of Rochefocault; one of my servants enquiring of the  first of those Masters of Arts, what Gentleman he was that followed  him; supposing my servant had meant his fellow-scholler, for he had  not yet seen the Earles traine, answered pleasantly, \"He is no  gentleman, Sir, but a Gramarian, and I am a Logitian.\" Now, we that  contrariwise seek not to frame a Gramarian, nor a Logitian, but a  compleat gentleman, let us give them leave to mispend their time; we  have else-where, and somewhat else of more import to doe. So that  our Disciple be well and sufficiently stored with matter; words will  follow apace, and if they will hot follow gently, he shall hale them  on perforce. I heare some excuse themselves, that they cannot  expresse their meaning, and make a semblance that their heads are so  full stuft with many goodly things, but for want of eloquence they  can neither titter nor make show of them. It is a meere fopperie.  And will you know what, in my seeming, the cause is? They are  shadows and Chimeraes, proceeding of some formelesse conceptions,  which they cannot distinguish or resolve within, and by consequence  are not able to produce them in as-much as they understand not  themselves: And if you but marke their earnestnesse, and how they  stammer and labour at the point of their deliverle, you would deeme  that what they go withall, is but a conceiving, and therefore  nothing neere downelying; and that they doe but licke that imperfect  and shapelesse lump of matter. As for me, I am of opinion, and  Socrates would have it so, that he who had a cleare and lively  imagination in his mind, may easilie produce and utter the same,  although it be in Bergamaske [Footnote: A rustic dialect of the  north of Italy.] or Welsh, and if he be dumbe, by signes and tokens.         Verbaque praevisam rem non invita sequentur.       [Footnote: HOR. Art. Poet. 311.]"]]]
