Perhaps that was  what accounted for Bogan. Sometimes, in his sober moods, I used to have  an idea that there must have been something behind the Bogan to account  for him. Perhaps he got trapped--or got married and found out that he'd  made a mistake--which is about the worst thing a man can find out----\"    \"Except that his wife made the mistake, Mitchell,\" said Tom Hall.    \"Or that both did,\" reflected Mitchell. \"Ah, well!--never mind--Bogan  had been married two or three years. Maybe he got married when he was on  the spree--I knew that he used to send money to someone in Sydney and I  suppose it was her. Anyway, she turned up after he was blind. She was a  hard-looking woman--just the sort that might have kept a third-rate pub  or a sly-grog shop. But you can't judge between husband and wife, unless  you've lived in the same house with them--and under the same roofs with  their parents right back to Adam for that matter. Anyway, she stuck  to Bogan all right; she took a little two-roomed cottage and made  him comfortable--she's got a sewing-machine and a mangle and takes in  washing and sewing. She brought a carrotty-headed youngster with  her, and the first time I saw Bogan sitting on the veranda with that  youngster on his knee I thought it was a good thing that he was blind.\"    \"Why?\" I asked.    \"Because the youngster isn't his,\" said Mitchell.    \"How do you know that?\"    \"By the look of it--and by the look on her face, once, when she caught  me squinting from the kid's face to Bogan's.\"    \"And whose was it?\" I asked, without thinking.    \"How am I to know?\" said Mitchell. \"It might be yours for all I  know--it's ugly enough, and you never had any taste in women. But you  mustn't speak of that in Bourke. But there's another youngster coming,  and I'll swear that'll be Bogan's all right.    \"A curious thing about Bogan is that he's begun to be fidgety about his  personal appearance--and you know he wasn't a dood. He wears a collar  now, and polishes his boots; he wears elastic-sides, and polishes 'em  himself--the only thing is that he blackens over the elastic. He can do  many things for himself, and he's proud of it. He says he can see many  things that he couldn't see when he had his eyes. You seldom hear him  swear, save in a friendly way; he seems much gentler, but he reckons he  would stand a show with Barcoo-Rot even now, if Barcoo would stand up in  front of him and keep yelling----\"    \"By the way,\" I asked, \"how did Bogan lose the sight of his other eye?\"    \"Sleeping out in the rain when he was drunk,\" said Mitchell. \"He got a  cold in his eye.\" Then he asked, suddenly:    \"Did you ever see a blind man cry?\"    \"No,\" I said.    \"Well, I have,\" said Mitchell.    \"You know Bogan wears goggles to hide his eyes--his wife made him do  that. The chaps often used to drop round and have a yarn with Bogan  and cheer him up, and one evening I was sitting smoking with him, and  yarning about old times, when he got very quiet all of a sudden, and I  saw a tear drop from under one of his shutters and roll down his cheek.  It wasn't the eye he lost saving Campbell--it was the old wall-eye he  used to use in the days before he was called 'One-eyed Bogan.' I suppose  he thought it was dark and that I couldn't see his face. (There's a good  many people in this world who think you can't see because they can't.)  It made me feel like I used to feel sometimes in the days when I felt  things----\"    \"Come on, Mitchell,\" said Tom Hall, \"you've had enough beer.\"    \"I think I have,\" said Mitchell. \"Besides, I promised to send a wire  to Jake Boreham to tell him that his mother's dead. Jake's shearing at  West-o'-Sunday; shearing won't be over for three or four weeks, and Jake  wants an excuse to get away without offending old Baldy and come down  and have a fly round with us before the holidays are over.\"    Down at the telegraph-office Mitchell took a form and filled it in very  carefully: \"Jacob Boreham. West-o'-Sunday Station. Bourke. Come home at  once. Mother is dead. In terrible trouble. Father dying.--MARY BOREHAM.\"    \"I think that will do,\" said Mitchell. \"It ought to satisfy Baldy, and  it won't give Jake too much of a shock, because he hasn't got a sister  or sister-in-law, and his father and mother's been dead over ten years.\"    \"Now, if I was running a theatre,\" said Mitchell, as we left the office,  \"I'd give five pounds a night for the face Jake'll have on him when he  takes that telegram to Baldy Thompson.\"          TWO SUNDOWNERS      Sheep stations in Australia are any distance from twenty to a hundred  miles apart, to keep well within the boundaries of truth and the great  pastoral country. Shearing at any one shed only lasts a few weeks in  the year; the number of men employed is according to the size of the  shed--from three to five men in the little bough-covered shed of the  small \"cockatoo,\" up to a hundred and fifty or two hundred hands all  told in the big corrugated iron machine shed of a pastoral company.    Shearing starts early up in northern Queensland, where you can get a  \"January shed;\" and further south, in February, March or April sheds,  and so on down into New South Wales, where shearing often lasts over  Christmas. Shearers travel from shed to shed; some go a travel season  without getting a pen, and an unlucky shearer might ride or tramp for  several seasons and never get hands in wool; and all this explains the  existence of the \"footman\" with his swag and the horse man with his  packhorse. They have a rough life, and the Australian shearers are  certainly the most democratic and perhaps the most independent,  intelligent and generous body of workmen in the world.    Shearers at a shed elect their own cook, pay him so much a head,  and they buy their rations in the lump from the station store; and  \"travellers,\" i.e. shearers and rouseabouts travelling for work, are  invited, as a matter of course, to sit down to the shearers' table.  Also a certain allowance of tea, sugar, flour or meat is still made  to travellers at most Western station stores; so it would be rather  surprising if there weren't some who, travelled on the game. The swagman  loafer, or \"bummer,\" times himself, especially in bad weather, to arrive  at the shed just about sundown; he is then sure of \"tea,\" shelter for  the night, breakfast, and some tucker from the cook to take him on along  the track. Brummy and Swampy were sundowners.    Swampy was a bummer born--and proud of it. Brummy had drifted down to  loaferdom, and his nature was soured and his spirit revengeful against  the world because of the memory of early years wasted at hard work and  in being honest. Both were short and stout, and both had scrubby beards,  but Brummy's beard was a dusty black and Swampy's fiery red--he indulged  in a monkey-shave sometimes, but his lower face was mostly like a  patch of coarse stubble with a dying hedge round it. They had travelled  together for a long time. They seemed at times to hate each other with  a murderous hatred, but they were too lazy to fight. Sometimes they'd  tramp side, by side and growl at each other by the hour, other times  they'd sulk for days; one would push on ahead and the other drop behind  until there was a mile or two between them; but one always carried the  billy, or the sugar, or something that was necessary to the comfort  of the other, so they'd come together at sundown. They had travelled  together a long time, and perhaps that was why they hated each other.  They often agreed to part and take different tracks, and sometimes they  parted--for a while. They agreed in cadging, and cadged in turn. They  carried a spare set of tucker-bags, and if, for instance, they were out  of sugar and had plenty flour and tea, Brummy or Swampy would go to the  store, boundary-rider's hut, or selector's, with the sugar-bag in his  hand and the other bags in his shirt front on spec. He'd get the sugar  first, and then, if it looked good enough, the flour-bag would come out,  then the tea-bag. And before he left he'd remark casually that he and  his mate hadn't had a smoke for two days. They never missed a chance.  And when they'd cadged more tucker than they could comfortably carry,  they'd camp for a day or two and eat it down. Sometimes they'd have as  much as a pound of tobacco, all in little \"borrowed\" bits, cut from the  sticks or cakes of honest travellers. They never missed a chance. If a  stranger gave Swampy his cake of tobacco with instructions to \"cut off a  pipeful,\" Swampy would cut off as much as he thought judicious, talking  to the stranger and watching his eye all the time, and hiding his palm  as much as possible--and sometimes, when he knew he'd cut off more than  he could cram into his pipe, he'd put his hand in his pocket for the  pipe and drop some of the tobacco there. Then he'd hand the plug to his  mate, engage the stranger in conversation and try to hold his eye or  detract his attention from Brummy so as to give Brummy a chance of  cutting off a couple of pipefuls, and, maybe, nicking off a corner of  the cake and slipping it into his pocket. I once heard a bushman say  that no one but a skunk would be guilty of this tobacco trick--that it  is about the meanest trick a man could be capable of--_because it spoils  the chances of the next hard-up swaggy who asks the victim for tobacco._    When Brummy and Swampy came to a shed where shearing was in full swing,  they'd inquire, first thing, and with some show of anxiety, if there was  any chance of gettin' on; if the shed was full-handed they'd growl  about hard times, wonder what the country was coming to; talk of their  missuses and kids that they'd left in Sydney, curse the squatters and  the Government, and, next morning, get a supply of rations from the cook  and depart with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7070"],[0,"The Treasure of the Incas: A Story of Adventure in Peru (#13)"],[1,"to work in the mines till they died has had a great effect  in inducing them to conceal the existence of these places from them.  Now that the Spaniards have been cleared out there is no longer any  ground for apprehension of that kind, but they may still feel that the  Peruvians would get the giant's share in any mine or treasure that  might be found, and that the Indians would, under one pretence or  another, be defrauded out of any share of it. It is not wonderful that  it should be so considering how these poor people have been treated by  the whites, and it would really seem that the way in which Spain has  gone to the dogs is a punishment for her cruelties in South America and  the Islands. It may be said that from the very moment when the gold  began to flow the descent of Spain commenced; in spite of the enormous  wealth she acquired she fell gradually from her position as the  greatest power in Europe.    \"In 1525, after the battle of Pavia, Spain stood at the height of her  power. Mexico was conquered by Cortez seven years before, Peru in 1531,  and the wealth of those countries began to flow into Spain in enormous  quantities, and yet her decline followed speedily. She was bearded by  our bucaneers among the Islands and on the western coast; the  Netherlands revolted, and after fierce fighting threw off her yoke; the  battle of Ivry and the accession of Henry of Navarre all but destroyed  her influence in France; the defeat of the Armada and the capture of  Cadiz struck a fatal blow both to her power on the sea and to her  commerce, and within a century of the conquest of Peru, Spain was  already an enfeebled and decaying power. It would almost seem that the  discoveries of Columbus, from which such great things were hoped,  proved in the long run the greatest misfortune that ever befell Spain.\"    \"It does look like it, Harry; however, we must hope that whatever  effect the discovery of America had upon Portugal or Spain, it will  make your fortune.\"    Harry laughed.    \"I hope so, Bertie, but it is as well not to be too hopeful. Still, I  have great faith in Dias, at any rate I feel confident that he will do  all he can; but he acknowledges that he knows nothing for certain. I am  sure, however, that he will be a faithful guide, and that though we may  have a rough time, it will not be an unpleasant one. Now, you must  begin to turn to account what Spanish you have learned during the  voyage; I know you have worked regularly at it while you have not been  on duty.\"    \"I have learned a good lot,\" Bertie said; \"and I dare say I could ask  for anything, but I should not understand the answers. I can make out a  lot of that Spanish _Don Quixote_ you got for me, but when Dias was  talking to you I did not catch a word of what he was saying. I suppose  it will all come in time.\"    \"But you must begin at once. I warn you that when I am fairly off I  shall always talk to you in Spanish, for it would look very unsociable  if we were always talking together in English. If you ride or walk by  the side of the boy you will soon get on; and there will be Donna Maria  for you to chat away with, and from what we saw of her I should say she  is sociably inclined. In three months I have no doubt you will talk  Spanish as well as I do.\"    \"It will be a horrid nuisance,\" Bertie grumbled; \"but I suppose it has  got to be done.\"    Three days later Dias said he thought they might as well start the next  day to Pachacamac.    \"We shall only want the three riding mules and one for baggage. Of  course we shall not take Jose or my wife. By the time we return  everything will be ready for us.\"    \"I shall be very glad to be off, Dias. We know no one here except Senor  Pasquez; and although he has been very civil and has begged us to  consider his house as our own, he is of course busy during the day, and  one can't do above a certain amount of walking about the streets. So by  all means let us start to-morrow morning. We may as well go this time  in the clothes we wear, it will be time enough to put on the things we  have bought when we start in earnest.\"    Starting at sunrise, they rode for some distance through a fertile  valley, and then crossed a sandy plain until they reached the little  valley of Lurin, in which stand the ruins of Pachacamac. This was the  sacred city of the natives of the coast before their conquest by the  Incas. During their forty-mile ride Dias had told them something of the  place they were about to visit. Pachacamac, meaning \"the creator of the  world,\" was the chief divinity of these early people, and here was the  great temple dedicated to him. The Incas after their conquest erected a  vast Temple of the Sun, but they did not attempt to suppress the  worship of Pachacamac, and the two flourished side by side until the  arrival of the Spaniards. The wealth of the temple was great; the  Spaniards carried away among their spoils one thousand six hundred and  eighty-seven pounds of gold and one thousand six hundred ounces of  silver; but with all their efforts they failed to discover the main  treasure, said to have been no less than twenty-four thousand eight  hundred pounds of gold, which had been carried away and buried before  their arrival.    \"If the Spaniards could not succeed in getting at the hiding-place,  although, no doubt, they tortured everyone connected with the temple to  make them divulge the secret, it is evident there is no chance for us,\"  Harry said.    \"Yes, senor, they made every effort; thousands of natives were employed  in driving passages through the terraces on which the temple stood. I  believe that they did find much treasure, but certainly not the great  one they were searching for. There is no tradition among our people as  to the hiding-place, for so many of the natives perished that all to  whom the secret was known must have died without revealing it to  anybody. Had it not been so, the Spaniards would sooner or later have  learned it, for although hundreds have died under torture rather than  reveal any of the hiding-places, surely one more faint-hearted than the  rest would have disclosed them. Certain it is that at Cuzco and other  places they succeeded in obtaining almost all the treasures buried  there, though they failed in discovering the still greater treasures  that had been carried away to be hidden in different spots. But  Pachacamac was a small one in comparison with Cuzco, and it was  believed that the treasures had not been carried far. Tradition has it  that they were buried somewhere between this town and Lima. Doubtless  all concerned in the matter fled before the Spaniards arrived, at any  rate with all their cruelty the invaders never discovered its position.  The report that it was buried near may have been set about to prevent  their hunting for it elsewhere, and the gold may be lying now somewhere  in the heart of the mountains.\"    Harry Prendergast and his brother looked in astonishment at the massive  walls that rose around the eminence on which the temple had stood. The  latter had disappeared, but its situation could be traced on the  plateau buttressed by the walls. These were of immense thickness, and  formed of huge adobe bricks almost as hard as stone; even the long  efforts of the Spaniards had caused but little damage to them. The  plateau rose some five hundred feet above the sea, which almost washed  one face of it. Half-way up the hill four series of these massive  walls, whose tops formed terraces, stood in giant steps some fifty feet  high. Here and there spots of red paint could be seen, showing that the  whole surface was originally painted. The ascent was made by winding  passages through the walls. On the side of the upper area facing the  sea could be seen the remains of a sort of walk or esplanade, with  traces of edifices of various kinds. On a hill a mile and a half away  were the remains of the Incas' temple and nunnery, the style differing  materially from that of the older building; it was still more damaged  than the temple on the hill by the searchers for treasure.    Pachacamac was the most sacred spot in South America, vast numbers of  pilgrims came here from all points. The city itself had entirely  disappeared, covered deeply in sand, but for a long distance round, it  had, like the neighbourhood of Jerusalem and Mecca, been a vast  cemetery, and a small amount of excavation showed the tombs of the  faithful, occupied in most cases by mummies.    \"We will ride across to the Incas' temple. There is not much to see  there, but it is as well that you should look at the vaults in which  the treasures were hid. There are similar places at Cuzco and several  of the other ruins.\"    \"It may certainly be useful to see them,\" Harry agreed, and they rode  across the plain. Leaving their mules outside they entered the ruins.  The Indian led them into some underground chambers. He had brought a  torch with him, and this he now lit.    \"You have to be careful or you might otherwise tumble into one of these  holes and break a limb; and in that case, if you were here by  yourselves, you would certainly never get out again.\"    They came upon several of these places. The openings were sometimes  square and sometimes circular, and had doubtless been covered with  square stones. They were dug out of the solid ground. For about six  feet the sides of the pit were perpendicular; in some it swelled out  like a great vase with a broad shoulder, in others it became a square  chamber of some size.    \"Some of these places were no doubt meant to store grain and other  provisions,\" the Indian said, \"some were undoubtedly treasuries.\"    \"Awkward places to find,\" Harry said; \"one might spend a lifetime in  searching for them in only one of these temples.\"    \"They were the last places we should think of searching,\" Dias said.  \"For years the Spaniards kept thousands of men at work. I do not say  that there may not be some"]]]
