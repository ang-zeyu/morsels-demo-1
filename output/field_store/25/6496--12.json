We accepted the offer;  and in an hour afterwards, a person came and told me that he was sent on  purpose to conduct me to the king, who was very desirous of seeing me  immediately, if I was not too much fatigued.    I took my interpreter with me, and followed the messenger till we got  quite out of the town, and crossed some corn fields; when, suspecting  some trick, I stopped, and asked the guide whither he was going. Upon  which he pointed to a man sitting under a tree at some little distance;  and told me that the king frequently gave audiences in that retired  manner, in order to avoid a crowd of people; and that nobody but myself  and my interpreter must approach him. When I advanced, the king desired  me to come and sit by him upon the mat; and after hearing my story, on  which he made no observation, he asked if I wished to purchase any slaves  or gold: being answered in the negative, he seemed rather surprised; but  desired me to come to him in the evening, and he would give me some  provisions.    This monarch was called Almami; a Moorish name, though I was told that he  was not a Mahomedan, but a Kafir, or Pagan. I had heard that he had acted  towards Major Houghton with great unkindness, and caused him to be  plundered. His behaviour, therefore, towards myself at this interview,  though much more civil than I expected, was far from freeing me from  uneasiness. I still apprehended some double dealing; and as I was now  entirely in his power, I thought it best to smooth the way by a present:  Accordingly, I took with me in the evening one canister of gunpowder,  some amber, tobacco, and my umbrella: and as I considered that my bundles  would inevitably be searched, I concealed some few articles in the roof  of the hut where I lodged, and I put on my new blue coat, in order to  preserve it.    All the houses belonging to the king and his family are surrounded by a  lofty mud wall, which converts the whole into a kind of citadel. The  interior is subdivided into different courts. At the first place of  entrance I observed a man standing with a musket on his shoulder; and I  found the way to his presence very intricate, leading through many  passages, with sentinels placed at the different doors. When we came to  the entrance of the court in which the king resides, both my guide and  interpreter, according to custom, took off their sandals; and the former  pronounced the king's name aloud, repeating it till he was answered from  within. We found the monarch sitting upon a mat, and two attendants with  him. I repeated what I had before told him concerning the object of my  journey, and my reasons for passing through his country. He seemed,  however, but half satisfied. The notion of travelling for curiosity was  quite new to him. He thought it impossible, he said, that any man in his  senses would undertake so dangerous a journey, merely to look at the  country and its inhabitants: however, when I offered to show him the  contents of my portmanteau, and every thing belonging to me, he was  convinced: and it was evident that his suspicion had arisen from a  belief, that every white man must of necessity be a trader. When I had  delivered my presents, he seemed well pleased, and was particularly  delighted with the umbrella, which he repeatedly furled and unfurled, to  the great admiration of himself and his two attendants, who could not for  some time comprehend the use of this wonderful machine. After this I was  about to take my leave, when the king, desiring me to stop awhile, began  along preamble in favour of the whites; extolling their immense wealth  and good dispositions. He next proceeded to an eulogium on my blue coat,  of which the yellow buttons seemed particularly to catch his fancy; and  he concluded by entreating me to present him with it; assuring me, for my  consolation under the loss of it, that he would wear it on all public  occasions, and inform every one who saw it of my great liberality towards  him. The request of an African prince, in his own dominions, particularly  when made to a stranger, comes little short of a command. It is only a  way of obtaining by gentle means what he can, if he pleases, take by  force; and as it was against my interest to offend him by a refusal, I  very quietly took off my coat, the only good one in my possession, and  laid it at his feet.    In return for my compliance, he presented me with great plenty of  provisions, and desired to see me again in the morning. I accordingly  attended, and found him sitting upon his bed. He told me he was sick; and  wished to have a little blood taken from him; but I had no sooner tied up  his arm, and displayed the lancet, than his courage failed; and he begged  me to postpone the operation till the afternoon, as he felt himself, he  said, much better than he had been, and thanked me kindly for my  readiness to serve him. He then observed that his women were very  desirous to see me, and requested that I would favour them with a visit.  An attendant was ordered to conduct me; and I had no sooner entered the  court appropriated to the ladies, than the whole seraglio surrounded me:  some begging for physic, some for amber; and all of them desirous of  trying that great African specific, _blood-letting_. They were ten or  twelve in number, most of them young and handsome, and wearing on their  heads ornaments of gold, and beads of amber.    They rallied me with a good deal of gaiety on different subjects;  particularly upon the whiteness of my skin, and the prominency of my  nose. They insisted that both were artificial. The first, they said, was  produced when I was an infant, by dipping me in milk; and they insisted  that my nose had been pinched every day, till it had acquired its present  unsightly and unnatural conformation. On my part, without disputing my  own deformity, I paid them many compliments on African beauty, I praised  the glossy jet of their skins, and the lovely depression of their noses;  but they said that flattery, or (as they emphatically termed it)  _honey-mouth_, was not esteemed in Bondou. In return, however, for my  company or my compliments, (to which, by the way, they seemed not so  insensible as they affected to be), they presented me with a jar of honey  and some fish, which were sent to my lodging; and I was desired to come  again to the king a little before sunset.    I carried with me some beads and writing paper, it being usual to present  some small offering on taking leave; in return for which, the king gave  me five drachms of gold; observing that it was but a trifle, and given  out of pure friendship; but would be of use to me in travelling, for the  purchase of provision. He seconded this act of kindness by one still  greater; politely telling me, that though it was customary to examine the  baggage of every traveller passing through his country, yet, in the  present instance, he would dispense with that ceremony; adding, that I  was at liberty to depart when I pleased.    Accordingly, on the morning of the 23d, we left Fatteconda, and about  eleven o'clock came to a small village, where we determined to stop for  the rest of the day.    In the afternoon my fellow-travellers informed me, that as this was the  boundary between Bondou and Kajaaga, and dangerous for travellers, it  would be necessary to continue our journey by night, until we should  reach a more hospitable part of the country. I agreed to the proposal,  and hired two people for guides through the woods; and as soon as the  people of the village were gone to sleep, (the moon shining bright,) we  set out. The stillness of the air, the howling of the wild beasts, and  the deep solitude of the forest, made the scene solemn and impressive.  Not a word was uttered by any of us, but in a whisper; all were  attentive, and every one anxious to show his sagacity, by pointing out to  me the wolves and hyaenas as they glided, like shadows, from one thicket  to another.--Towards morning we arrived at a village called Kimmoo,  where our guides awakened one of their acquaintances, and we stopped to  give the asses some corn and roast a few groundnuts for ourselves. At  daylight we resumed our journey, and in the afternoon arrived at Joag in  the kingdom of Kajaaga.    Being now in a country, and among a people, differing in many respects  from those that have as yet fallen under our observation, I shall, before  I proceed further, give some account of Bondou, (the territory we have  left,) and its inhabitants, the Foulahs, the description of whom I  purposely reserved for this part of my work.    Bondou is bounded on the east by Bambouk; on the south-east, and south,  by Tenda, and the Simbani Wilderness; on the south-west by Woolli; on the  west by Foota Torra; and on the north by Kajaaga.    The country, like that of Woolli, is very generally covered with woods,  but the land is more elevated, and towards the Faleme river, rises into  considerable hills. In native fertility the soil is not surpassed, I  believe, by any part of Africa.    From the central situation of Bondou between the Gambia and Senegal  rivers, it is become a place of great resort; both for the Slatees, who  generally pass through it, in going from the coast to the interior  countries, and for occasional traders, who frequently come hither from  the inland countries to purchase salt.    These different branches of commerce are conducted principally by  Mandingoes and Serawoollies, who have settled in the country. These  merchants likewise carry on a considerable trade with Gedumah, and other  Moorish countries, bartering corn and blue cotton cloths for salt; which  they again barter in Dentila and other districts for iron, shea-butter,  and small quantities of gold-dust. They likewise sell a variety of  sweet-smelling gums packed up in small bags, containing each about a  pound.

Rhyme, rhythm, alliteration, assonance, vowel  coloring, the effect of enjambement, to name only the more obvious  phenomena, appeal solely to the ear. Looking at a page of verse is like  looking at a page of music. Unless the symbols are translated into sound  values, the effect is blank. A skilled musician is able to translate the  printed notes to the inner sense, but even he will prefer to hear the  music and will always consider this the final test. Thus it is also with  verse: it must be read aloud. Lyric verse is best read in privacy or in a  small congenial group. When the humdrum noise and the humdrum cares of  the world have vanished, then the moment has come when one may steep  one's soul in lyric beauty. One never tires of a really great lyric: like  a true friend, a longer acquaintance adds only new delight.    And why read lyric poetry at all? Some people ask that question, and for  them the case may be hopeless. If the lyric sense is utterly lacking,  then it is their sad lot to live in the desert of the practical world.  Art is not for them: neither music nor poetry nor painting nor sculpture  nor architecture; for something of the lyric impulse lives in all of  these. But many ask that question who some day will see, and for them I  must attempt a brief answer. All literature is an interpretation of life,  and the better one understands life the better one understands  literature, and vice versa. Lyric poetry is the most direct  interpretation of life, because here the poet reveals his innermost self  directly. We strive to enrich our intellectual power by reliving the  thought of Plato and of Kant. Why not enrich our emotional life and our  whole being by reliving the world of Goethe or Shelley? The poets have  lived for us, and the pure essence of their life we can make our own in  their lyric verse.           *       *       *       *       *    ELEMENTS OF VERSIFICATION    RHYTHM.-- While in Greek and Latin it depends on quantity, i.e., length  of the syllables, in German as in English it depends on stress, that is,  accent. The smallest rhythmical unit is called a foot and corresponds to  a measure in music with the exception that the accent need not be on the  first syllable. A verse consists of two or more feet (verses with only a  single foot are rare) and may end either with an accented syllable  (masculine ending) or with an unaccented (feminine ending). Especially  within longer verses there often occurs a slight rest or break, called  caesura. Designating the accented syllable by -- and the unaccented by X,  the more common feet with their Graeco-Roman names may be represented  thus:      Iambic, X --    Trochee, -- X    Dactyl, -- XX    Anapaest, XX --.    This terminology is, however, of little avail in the German _Volkslied_,  that is the simple folksong, and in that large body of German verse which  is patterned after it. Here the basic principle is the number of accented  syllables. The number of unaccented syllables varies. A measure (i.e., a  foot) may have either one or two unaccented syllables, in the real  Volkslied often three. (A measure without an unaccented syllable, so  common in older verse, is but rarely met with to-day; see 84, 7.)  Goethe's more popular ballads as _Erlkönig_ or _der König in Thule_ offer  good examples of this freer technique. Above all, however, Heine made use  of this principle, while Platen, whom later German verse tends to follow  in this respect (e.g., Meyer and Liliencron), espoused the strict classic  ideal.[1]        [1] Exceptions are only apparent, as in 68, 7. Platen followed the      rules of Graeco-Roman prosody, where a long syllable could be      substituted for two short syllables.    RHYME.--When two or more words correspond from their accented vowel on,  they are said to rhyme: _Pferde--Erde_. The rhyming syllable must carry  at least a secondary accent: _Héiligkèit--Zéit_. Rhymes of one syllable  are called masculine, of two syllables feminine. According to their  degree of perfection rhymes are classified as pure and impure. Thus  _geboren--geschworen_, _bestellt--Welt_ are pure, _gesehn--schön_,  _gerissen--Füßen_, _Lied--Gemüt_, _sprach--Gemach_, _Wiesen--fließen_ are  impure. Impure rhymes are not of necessity poor, but may be used to  enhance the musical effects of a poem. Heine was a master in this  respect. The modern school, however, tends to avoid impure rhymes.    Rhymes within a verse are called internal rhymes.    ALLITERATION--two or more accented syllables beginning with the same  consonant or with a vowel: _Von weißen Wolken umwogt_, 59, 2--is used to  enhance the rhythmic-melodic character of a poem, as is also  assonance--the agreement of vowels in two or more accented syllables, 36.  Often assonance is practically a form of impure rhyme,  _Grunde--verschwunden_, 41, _Himmel--Schimmer_, 44.    STANZA--a union of two or more verses. In a stanza itself the individual  verses may either stand apart or two or more verses may form larger  units. Thus the structure of the various stanzas may be made to  differentiate and the rhythmic-melodic character of the poem be thereby  modified (44 and 56 and notes). Similarly, stanzas may form larger units  (2). If the end of a verse breaks into a syntactic unit, we have what is  called an enjambement. This tends to put a special stress on the last  word. Notice for example the onomatopoetic effect in 13, 7 and 8:      Aus dem bewegten Wasser rauscht    Ein feuchtes Weib hervor.    REFRAIN.--This is a repetition of one or more verses, either exactly  repeated or slightly modified, at the end of a stanza or less frequently  at another fixed place (4, 10, 34). Aside from its rhythmic-melodic  effect the refrain helps to center the attention on a certain idea or  motif.    STANZA AND VERSE FORMS.--Only a few need any special discussion.    1. _Blank Verse_. This is the verse of Shakspere and was introduced into  Germany from England. It is an unrhymed iambic verse of five feet (19).    2. _Freie Rhythmen_. An unrhymed verse that does not follow any fixed  form; the rhythm may vary even within the verse. The number of accented  syllables usually does not exceed four (15, 16 and 59).    3. _The Rhymed Couplet_ (_vierhebige Reimpaare_) was introduced from the  _Volkslied_. The verse ending is always masculine. Best adapted to a  rapidly progressing action, every stanza marks a forward step, portrays a  new scene (28, 29, 74).    4. _The Sonnet_, an Italian verse form, is composed of fourteen iambic  lines of five feet each. The rhyme for the first eight lines, called the  octave, is always _abbaabba_; for the last six, called the sestette, the  rhyme may be _cdcdcd_, _ccdccd_, or _cdecde_ (69 and 77).    5. _The Siziliane_, likewise Italian, consists of eight iambic lines of  five feet each, the rhyme being _abababab_ (135 and 136).    6. _The Modified Nibelungen Stanza_, an adaptation of the stanza of the  Nibelungenlied introduced by Uhland, is a stanza of four verses rhyming  in couplets; each verse has six accented syllables with a fixed pause as  indicated below in the scansion of the first two lines of 32:      X -- X -- X -- X || X -- X -- X--    X -- X -- XX -- X || X -- X -- X --    Each line is in reality composed of two verses and thus we have here the  form so commonly used by Heine (48, 49, 50, 51, 52 and others). Each  verse has in reality four measures, the last measure being taken up by a  pause:      Es stand in al ten Zei ten | | ein Schloss so hoch und hehr.     X   --   X --  X   --  X *    X     --     X  --   X   -- **    In music these pauses may be taken up in whole or in part by lengthening  the preceding notes (to some extent this holds true in reading, adding to  the effect of the enjambement). _Die Lorelei_ offers a good example:    [Musical notation in original for following lyric. Transcriber.]      Ich weiß nicht, was soll es bedeuten, daß    ich so traurig bin; ein Märchen aus alten    Zeiten, das kommt mir nicht aus bem Sinn.
