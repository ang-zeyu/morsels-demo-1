And any man that hath this hope in him purifies  himself, even as he is pure.--Why purify themselves as he is pure?  because, if they do not they cannot be like him.    10. The Lord said unto Moses, Leviticus, 19:2: Speak unto all the  congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be  holy: for I the Lord your God am holy. And Peter says, first epistle,  1:15 and 16: But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in  all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I  am holy. And the Saviour says, Matthew, 5:48: Be ye therefore perfect,  even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. If any should ask,  why all these sayings? the answer is to be found from what is before  noted from John's epistle, that when he (the Lord) shall appear, the  saints will be like him: and if they are not holy, as he is holy, and  perfect as he is perfect, they cannot be like him; for no being can  enjoy his glory without possessing his perfections and holiness, no  more than they could reign in his kingdom without his power.    11. This clearly sets forth the propriety of the Saviour's saying,  recorded in John's testimony, 14:12: Verily, verily, I say unto you,  he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and  greater works than these, because I go unto my Father.--This taken in  connection with some of the sayings in the Saviour's prayer, recorded  in the 17th chapter, gives great clearness to his expressions: He says  in the 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24: Neither pray I for these alone, but for  them also who shall believe on me through their words; that they all  may be one; as you, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also  may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.  And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them; that they may be  one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be  made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent  me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. Father, I will that  they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am: that they may  behold my glory which thou hast given me; for thou lovedest me before  the foundation of the world.    12. All these sayings put together, give as clear an account of the  state of the glorified saints as language could give--the works that  Jesus had done they were to do, and greater works than those which  he had done among them should they do, and that because he went to  the Father. He does not say that they should do these works in time;  but they should do greater works because he went to the Father. He  says, in the 24th verse: Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast  given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory. These  sayings, taken in connection, make it very plain, that the greater  works, which those that believed on his name, were to do, were to be  done in eternity, where he was going, and where they should behold his  glory. He had said, in another part of his prayer, that he desired of  his Father, that those who believed on him should be one in him, as  he, and the Father were one in each other: Neither pray I for these  (the apostles) alone, but for them also who shall believe on me through  their words; that they all may be one: that is, they who believe on him  through the apostles' words, as well as the apostles themselves: that  they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee; that  they also may be one in us.    13. What language can be plainer than this? The Saviour surely intended  to be understood by his disciples: and he so spake that they might  understand him; for he declares to his Father, in language not to be  easily mistaken, that he wanted his disciples, even all of them, to  be as himself and the Father: for as he and the Father were one so  they might be one with them. And what is said in the 22nd verse is  calculated to more firmly establish this belief, if it needs any thing  to establish it. He says, And the glory which thou gavest me, I have  given them, that they may be one, even as we are one. As much as to  say, that unless they have the glory which the Father had given him,  they could not be one with them: For he says he had given them the  glory that the Father had given him, that they might be one; or, in  other words, to make them one.    14. This fills up the measure of information on this subject, and shows  most clearly, that the Saviour wished his disciples to understand that  they were to be partakers with him in all things: not even his glory  excepted.    15. It is scarcely necessary here to observe what we have previously  noticed: that the glory which the Father and the Son have, is because  they are just and holy beings; and that if they were lacking in one  attribute or perfection which they have, the glory which they have,  never could be enjoyed by them; for it requires them to be precisely  what they are in order to enjoy it: and if the Saviour gives this glory  to any others, he must do it in the very way set forth in his prayer  to his Father: by making them one with him, as he and the Father are  one.--In so doing he would give them the glory which the Father has  given him; and when his disciples are made one with the Father and Son,  as the Father and the Son are one, who cannot see the propriety of the  Saviour's saying, The works which I do, shall they do; and greater  works than these shall they do, because I go to my Father?    16. These teachings of the Saviour most clearly show unto us the nature  of salvation; and what he proposed unto the human family when he  proposed to save them--That he proposed to make them like unto himself;  and he was like the Father, the great prototype of all saved beings;  and for any portion of the human family to be assimilated into their  likeness is to be saved; and to be unlike them is to be destroyed: and  on this hinge turns the door of salvation.    17. Who cannot see, then, that salvation is the effect of faith? for,  as we have previously observed, all the heavenly beings work by this  principle; and it is because they are able so to do that they are  saved: for nothing but this could save them. And this is the lesson  which the God of heaven, by the mouth of all his holy prophets, has  been endeavouring to teach to the world. Hence we are told, that  without faith it is impossible to please God; and that salvation is of  faith, that it might be by grace to the end, the promise might be sure  to all the seed. Romans 4:16--And that Israel, who followed after the  law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.  Wherefore? because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the  works of the law; for they stumbled at that stumbling stone. Romans  9:32. And Jesus said unto the man who brought his son to him, to get  the devil who tormented him, cast out, If you canst believe, all things  are possible to him that believeth. Mark, 9:23. These with a multitude  of other scriptures, which might be quoted, plainly set forth the  light in which the Saviour, as well as the Former Day Saints, viewed  the plan of salvation.--That it was a system of faith--it begins with  faith, and continues by faith; and every blessing which is obtained,  in relation to it, is the effect of faith, whether it pertains to  this life or that which is to come.--To this, all the revelations of  God bear witness. If there were children of promise, they were the  effects of faith: not even the Saviour of the world excepted: Blessed  is she that believed, said Elizabeth to Mary, when she went to visit  her;--for there shall be a performance of those things which were told  her from the Lord; Luke, 1:45: Nor was the birth of John the Baptist  the less a matter of faith; for in order that his father Zacharias  might believe he was struck dumb. And through the whole history of  the scheme of life and salvation, it is a matter of faith: every man  received according to his faith: according as his faith was, so were  his blessings and privileges; and nothing was withheld from him when  his faith was sufficient to receive it. He could stop the mouths of  lions, quench the violence of fire, escape the edge of the sword, wax  valiant in fight, and put to flight the armies of the aliens; women  could, by their faith, receive their dead children to life again; in a  word, there was nothing impossible with them who had faith. All things  were in subjection to the Former Day Saints, according as their faith  was--By their faith they could obtain heavenly visions, the ministering  of angels, have knowledge of the spirits of just men made perfect, of  the general assembly and church of the first born, whose names are  written in heaven, of God the judge of all, of Jesus the Mediator of  the new covenant, and become familiar with the third heavens, see and  hear things which were not only unutterable, but were unlawful to  utter. Peter, in view of the power of faith, 2nd epistle, 1:1,2 and 3,  says to the Former Day Saints: grace and peace be multiplied unto you,  through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, according as his  divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and  godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us unto glory  and virtue. In the first epistle, 1:3,4 and 5, he says, Blessed be the  God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant  mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection  of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#13)"],[1,"than to create one  in a state previously passive. When a people have no sufficient value  for, and attachment to, a representative constitution, they have next  to no chance of retaining it. In every country, the executive is the  branch of the government which wields the immediate power, and is in  direct contact with the public; to it, principally, the hopes and  fears of individuals are directed, and by it both the benefits, and  the terrors, and _prestige_ of government are mainly represented to  the public eye. Unless, therefore, the authorities whose office it is  to check the executive are backed by an effective opinion and feeling  in the country, the executive has always the means of setting them  aside or compelling them to subservience, and is sure to be well  supported in doing so. Representative institutions necessarily depend  for permanence upon the readiness of the people to fight for them in  case of their being endangered. If too little valued for this, they  seldom obtain a footing at all, and if they do, are almost sure to be  overthrown as soon as the head of the government, or any party leader  who can muster force for a _coup de main_, is willing to run some  small risk for absolute power.    These considerations relate to the first two causes of failure in a  representative government. The third is when the people want either  the will or the capacity to fulfill the part which belongs to them in  a representative constitution. When nobody, or only some small  fraction, feels the degree of interest in the general affairs of the  state necessary to the formation of a public opinion, the electors  will seldom make any use of the right of suffrage but to serve their  private interest, or the interest of their locality, or of some one  with whom they are connected as adherents or dependents. The small  class who, in this state of public feeling, gain the command of the  representative body, for the most part use it solely as a means of  seeking their fortune. If the executive is weak, the country is  distracted by mere struggles for place; if strong, it makes itself  despotic, at the cheap price of appeasing the representatives, or such  of them as are capable of giving trouble, by a share of the spoil; and  the only fruit produced by national representation is, that in  addition to those who really govern, there is an assembly quartered on  the public, and no abuse in which a portion of the assembly are  interested is at all likely to be removed. When, however, the evil  stops here, the price may be worth paying for the publicity and  discussion which, though not an invariable, are a natural  accompaniment of any, even nominal, representation. In the modern  kingdom of Greece, for example, it can hardly be doubted, that the  place-hunters who chiefly compose the representative assembly, though  they contribute little or nothing directly to good government, nor  even much temper the arbitrary power of the executive, yet keep up the  idea of popular rights, and conduce greatly to the real liberty of the  press which exists in that country. This benefit, however, is entirely  dependent on the coexistence with the popular body of an hereditary  king. If, instead of struggling for the favors of the chief ruler,  these selfish and sordid factions struggled for the chief place  itself, they would certainly, as in Spanish America, keep the country  in a state of chronic revolution and civil war. A despotism, not even  legal, but of illegal violence, would be alternately exercised by a  succession of political adventurers, and the name and forms of  representation would have no effect but to prevent despotism from  attaining the stability and security by which alone its evils can be  mitigated or its few advantages realized.    The preceding are the cases in which representative government can not  permanently exist. There are others in which it possibly might exist,  but in which some other form of government would be preferable. These  are principally when the people, in order to advance in civilization,  have some lesson to learn, some habit not yet acquired, to the  acquisition of which representative government is likely to be an  impediment.    The most obvious of these cases is the one already considered, in  which the people have still to learn the first lesson of civilization,  that of obedience. A race who have been trained in energy and courage  by struggles with Nature and their neighbors, but who have not yet  settled down into permanent obedience to any common superior, would be  little likely to acquire this habit under the collective government of  their own body. A representative assembly drawn from among themselves  would simply reflect their own turbulent insubordination. It would  refuse its authority to all proceedings which would impose, on their  savage independence, any improving restraint. The mode in which such  tribes are usually brought to submit to the primary conditions of  civilized society is through the necessities of warfare, and the  despotic authority indispensable to military command. A military  leader is the only superior to whom they will submit, except  occasionally some prophet supposed to be inspired from above, or  conjurer regarded as possessing miraculous power. These may exercise a  temporary ascendancy, but as it is merely personal, it rarely effects  any change in the general habits of the people, unless the prophet,  like Mohammed, is also a military chief, and goes forth the armed  apostle of a new religion; or unless the military chiefs ally  themselves with his influence, and turn it into a prop for their own  government.    A people are no less unfitted for representative government by the  contrary fault to that last specified--by extreme passiveness, and  ready submission to tyranny. If a people thus prostrated by character  and circumstances could obtain representative institutions, they would  inevitably choose their tyrants as their representatives, and the yoke  would be made heavier on them by the contrivance which _prima facie_  might be expected to lighten it. On the contrary, many a people has  gradually emerged from this condition by the aid of a central  authority, whose position has made it the rival, and has ended by  making it the master, of the local despots, and which, above all, has  been single. French history, from Hugh Capet to Richelieu and Louis  XIV., is a continued example of this course of things. Even when the  king was scarcely so powerful as many of his chief feudatories, the  great advantage which he derived from being but one has been  recognized by French historians. To him the eyes of _all_ the locally  oppressed were turned; he was the object of hope and reliance  throughout the kingdom, while each local potentate was only powerful  within a more or less confined space. At his hands, refuge and  protection were sought from every part of the country against first  one, then another of the immediate oppressors. His progress to  ascendancy was slow; but it resulted from successively taking  advantage of opportunities which offered themselves only to him. It  was, therefore, sure; and, in proportion as it was accomplished, it  abated, in the oppressed portion of the community, the habit of  submitting to oppression. The king's interest lay in encouraging all  partial attempts on the part of the serfs to emancipate themselves  from their masters, and place themselves in immediate subordination to  himself. Under his protection numerous communities were formed which  knew no one above them but the king. Obedience to a distant monarch is  liberty itself compared with the dominion of the lord of the  neighboring castle; and the monarch was long compelled by necessities  of position to exert his authority as the ally rather than the master  of the classes whom he had aided in affecting their liberation. In  this manner a central power, despotic in principle, though generally  much restricted in practice, was mainly instrumental in carrying the  people through a necessary stage of improvement, which representative  government, if real, would most likely have prevented them from  entering upon. There are parts of Europe where the same work is still  to be done, and no prospect of its being done by any other means.  Nothing short of despotic rule or a general massacre could effect the  emancipation of the serfs in the Russian Empire.    The same passages of history forcibly illustrate another mode in which  unlimited monarchy overcomes obstacles to the progress of civilization  which representative government would have had a decided tendency to  aggravate. One of the strongest hindrances to improvement, up to a  rather advanced stage, is an inveterate spirit of locality. Portions  of mankind, in many other respects capable of, and prepared for  freedom, may be unqualified for amalgamating into even the smallest  nation. Not only may jealousies and antipathies repel them from one  another, and bar all possibility of voluntary union, but they may not  yet have acquired any of the feelings or habits which would make the  union real, supposing it to be nominally accomplished. They may, like  the citizens of an ancient community, or those of an Asiatic village,  have had considerable practice in exercising their faculties on  village or town interests, and have even realized a tolerably  effective popular government on that restricted scale, and may yet  have but slender sympathies with any thing beyond, and no habit or  capacity of dealing with interests common to many such communities. I  am not aware that history furnishes any example in which a number of  these political atoms or corpuscles have coalesced into a body, and  learned to feel themselves one people, except through previous  subjection to a central authority common to all.
