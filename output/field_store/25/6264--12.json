After the relief of  Kimberley and the capture of Cronje he went to the Cape to meet the  Oxfordshire Yeomanry, and with them gallantly advanced to meet his  fate--the first Yeomanry officer in this history of ours to fall in  action.    [Illustration: COLONEL LORD CHESHAM, Imperial Yeomanry    Photo by Russell & Sons, London]    At the close of the fight the clouds which had been lowering over the  position like a pall of purple suddenly burst. Torrents descended,  saturating the heated troops and sopping the ground whereon lay the  maimed and slain. With thunder bellowing and lightning splitting the  skies, with an accompaniment of deluge and darkness, the troops and  their prisoners found their way to camp. Under cover of the  obscurity some of the latter made a wild endeavour to escape, but the  Yeomanry were too proud of their \"bag\" to allow a single one to get  free, and finally had the satisfaction of seeing their bedraggled prize  lodged in jail.    Lord Methuen commanded, and expressed himself much gratified with the  success of the operations, with the courage and coolness and method with  which all his orders were carried out. Colonel Peakman, of Kimberley  fame, who had already accomplished a quite unusual record of fighting,  displayed an immense amount of talent in the field, and his corps, in  every way worthy of him, cut off the enemy's retreat with remarkable  skill. So much indeed, that the Boers complained of the slimness of the  troops who, by apparently retiring hurriedly, drew them within range of  the British volleys! Our troops were pitting themselves now against no  unruly or uninitiated barbarians, for the hostile force was under the  command of the notable Frenchman, Colonel de Villebois-Mareuil. This  gallant officer was killed by shrapnel from the 4th Field Battery Royal  Field Artillery before the display of the white flag by the Boers. He  was accompanied by many of his compatriots, who were taken prisoners.  The force indeed was mainly cosmopolitan, it being composed of  Hollanders, Frenchmen, Germans, and Russians, three Boers only belonging  to the commando. Not a man of the enemy escaped. Eight were killed, six  wounded, and fifty-four polyglot prisoners, with sixty horses and their  baggage, were brought into camp. Two guns were also captured.    The courage and dash of the Imperial Yeomanry was eulogised on all  sides, even by the Colonials, who hitherto had been somewhat disposed to  look down on their brother Volunteers from civilised and inexperienced  England. The magnificent spirit which inspired one and all, the grit  displayed by the wounded, and their self-abnegation were the subject of  much comment. A Colonial trooper, writing home his applause, said:  \"Where all behaved so well it is almost invidious to mention any one in  particular, but as an instance of the fine spirit which animated them, I  would mention two whose names I have ascertained, Sergeant-Major Coles,  of the Bucks Yeomanry, and Throgmorton, a trooper in the Oxfords. These  two continued in action after being wounded, the former with a bullet  through the shoulder, and the latter with a gunshot wound in the head,  and sooner than crowd the ambulance they rode in afterwards, twelve  miles in the darkness, through one of the worst thunder-storms it has  been my lot to witness. What they must have suffered in the state they  were in they alone know.\"    From all accounts the French colonel who fell was entirely confident of  success. Before the engagements he sent an invitation to his compatriots  to join his force. He thought he had discovered the flaws in the Boer  armour, and was bent on giving the Federals an object lesson in how to  defeat and scatter the British. He also issued a manifesto addressed to  the French legions, the translation of which ran thus:--         \"To the Legionaries, who have known me as their       comrade.--Officers, Non-commissioned Officers, and Men,--I know       that you have not forgotten me, and we understand each other,       and therefore I appeal to you. There is here in front of the       Vaal a people whom it is desired to rob of its rights, its       properties, and its liberty in order to satisfy some       capitalists by its downfall. The blood that runs in the veins       of this people is in part French blood. France, therefore, owes       to it some striking manifestation of help. Ah, well! You are       the men whom a soldier's temperament, apart from all the great       obligations of nationality, has gathered under this people's       flag, and may that flag bring with it the best of fortune! To       me you are the finished type of a troop that attacks and knows       not retreat.\"    He also wrote to the Parisians:--         \"The Dutch are splendid at defence, but they cannot follow up a       defeat and crush the enemy, which the French legionaries would       be able to do.... Come and I will receive you here; and I       promise you that very few days shall elapse before we will show       the world the mettle of which the French legionaries are made.\"    The display to unprejudiced onlookers was distinctly poor, however, and  the example of strategy set by the gallant Gaul scarcely served to  demonstrate astounding military genius.    The Colonel's plan of campaign was nevertheless most carefully made out,  as a document which subsequently fell into Lord Methuen's hands served  to show. Very dramatic sounds the orders for the movements on April 4,  as translated by the correspondent of the _Daily Telegraph_:--         \"To-night the detachment of the raid will attack Boshof and       follow its route, under the favour of a surprise and the       prevailing darkness. For this purpose, the following       dispositions will be observed: The column will set off at four       o'clock in the afternoon, with the detachment of Boers under       Field-Cornet Daniell, in such a manner as just to reach Boshof       by night. At a certain point the detachment will divide, and       will reach their respective places of assembly to the east and       west of the town. Boshof is situated in a plain, and is flanked       by certain kopjes, of which the importance and distance from       the town are reported as follows: to the north, two naked       kopjes, weakly guarded, and a good distance from the town.       Between them passes the Hoopstadt-Boshof road. To the east, on       the road to Kimberley, which it commands, one kopje, which is       not guarded by the enemy. Upon this the Boers will take up       their position. Finally, to the south-east of the town, and       exactly opposite to it, there is a kopje, where the English       have an outpost of fifty men. On the summit of this is formed a       small parapet of stones, about half the height of a man. This       will form part of the attack reserved for the detachment of the       raid.         \"The Hoopstadt and Kimberley roads cross in the interior of the       town.         \"The plan of attack will be carried out under the following       conditions: At eleven o'clock in the evening, the Boers under       Field-Cornet Daniell will be in position on the Kopje C, and       the telegraph wire on the Kimberley road will be cut by them.       At the same time, the raiding party will assemble behind the       Kopje E, situated two kilometres from the town. The horses and       the Scotch cart will there await the final operations, as well       as the native servants, if there are any. One man will be left       behind with each team of six horses. Commandant Saeremburg and       Lieutenant de Breda will, before the departure, choose these       men, the importance of whose mission will be readily       understood, since upon their vigilance will depend the safety       of the expedition in the event of retreat. The group left       behind will be under the orders of Nicollet. The men will       remain standing at the head of the horses, which will be       saddled and bridled, the cart boys at the head of the mules,       all ready harnessed.         \"At half-past eleven, the attacking party will march in three       echelons, twenty metres apart, the centre in the van. The       centre echelon, under the special direction of the General,       will be formed by the French platoon. The centre echelon,       commanded by Commandant Saeremburg, will consist of one-half of       the Dutch, and the left, under Lieutenant Bock, of the other       half. Furthermore, the men who have been in the habit of       messing together in groups will appoint a leader, from whom       they will on no account separate nor get out of touch. When       these groups do not exist, or exceed ten in number, the leaders       of the party will break them up and form parties of six or       eight, and appoint a head of the group. The General will see       these heads of groups at three o'clock in his camp, to give       them instructions further than can be detailed here.         \"In the approaching march the commandants will give their       orders in a low voice, and the men will be ranged in line, so       that they can see the heads of groups and lie down instantly.       It is of importance, also, to watch the investigations of the       search-light, if the English have one at Boshof, which has not       yet been ascertained. The moment the ray is turned towards the       echelon, the leader will make his group lie down, and the march       will not be resumed until the light is turned away. At the rise       of Kopje D, a halt will be made behind the cemetery, and the       Saeremburg echelon will carry the kopje by assault and will    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41085"],[0,"The New Life (La Vita Nuova) (#13)"],[1,"say that, according to the first, this sonnet has three parts. In  the first, I say that this lady was then in my memory. In the second,  I tell what Love therefore did with me. In the third, I speak of the  effects of Love. The second begins here, \"Love knowing;\" the third  here, \"Forth went they.\" This part divides into two. In the one, I say  that all my sighs issued speaking. In the other, I say how some spoke  certain words different from the others. The second begins here, \"And  still.\" In this same manner is it divided with the other beginning,  save that, in the first part, I tell when this lady had thus come into  my mind, and this I say not in the other._        That lady of all gentle memories        Had lighted on my soul;--whose new abode        Lies now, as it was well ordained of God,      Among the poor in heart, where Mary is.      Love, knowing that dear image to be his,        Woke up within the sick heart sorrow-bow'd,        Unto the sighs which are its weary load      Saying, \"Go forth.\" And they went forth, I wis;      Forth went they from my breast that throbbed and ached;        With such a pang as oftentimes will bathe          Mine eyes with tears when I am left alone.        And still those sighs which drew the heaviest breath      Came whispering thus: \"O noble intellect!          It is a year to-day that thou art gone.\"    Second Commencement.        That lady of all gentle memories        Had lighted on my soul;--for whose sake flow'd        The tears of Love; in whom the power abode      Which led you to observe while I did this.      Love, knowing that dear image to be his, etc.    Then, having sat for some space sorely in thought because of the time  that was now past, I was so filled with dolorous imaginings that it  became outwardly manifest in mine altered countenance. Whereupon,  feeling this and being in dread lest any should have seen me, I lifted  mine eyes to look; and then perceived a young and very beautiful lady,  who was gazing upon me from a window with a gaze full of pity, so that  the very sum of pity appeared gathered together in her. And seeing that  unhappy persons, when they beget compassion in others, are then most  moved unto weeping, as though they also felt pity for themselves, it  came to pass that mine eyes began to be inclined unto tears. Wherefore,  becoming fearful lest I should make manifest mine abject condition,  I rose up, and went where I could not be seen of that lady; saying  afterwards within myself: \"Certainly with her also must abide most  noble Love.\" And with that, I resolved upon writing a sonnet, wherein,  speaking unto her, I should say all that I have just said. And as this  sonnet is very evident, I will not divide it:--        Mine eyes beheld the blessed pity spring        Into thy countenance immediately        A while agone, when thou beheldst in me      The sickness only hidden grief can bring;      And then I knew thou wast considering        How abject and forlorn my life must be;        And I became afraid that thou shouldst see      My weeping, and account it a base thing.      Therefore I went out from thee; feeling how        The tears were straightway loosened at my heart          Beneath thine eyes' compassionate control.          And afterwards I said within my soul:        \"Lo! with this lady dwells the counterpart      Of the same Love who holds me weeping now.\"    It happened after this, that whensoever I was seen of this lady, she  became pale and of a piteous countenance, as though it had been with  love; whereby she remembered me many times of my own most noble lady,  who was wont to be of a like paleness. And I know that often, when I  could not weep nor in any way give ease unto mine anguish, I went to  look upon this lady, who seemed to bring the tears into my eyes by the  mere sight of her. Of the which thing I bethought me to speak unto her  in rhyme, and then made this sonnet: which begins, \"Love's pallor,\" and  which is plain without being divided, by its exposition aforesaid:--        Love's pallor and the semblance of deep ruth        Were never yet shown forth so perfectly        In any lady's face, chancing to see      Grief's miserable countenance uncouth,      As in thine, lady, they have sprung to soothe,        When in mine anguish thou hast looked on me;        Until sometimes it seems as if, through thee,      My heart might almost wander from its truth.      Yet so it is, I cannot hold mine eyes        From gazing very often upon thine          In the sore hope to shed those tears they keep;      And at such time, thou mak'st the pent tears rise        Even to the brim, till the eyes waste and pine;          Yet cannot they, while thou art present, weep.    At length, by the constant sight of this lady, mine eyes began to be  gladdened overmuch with her company; through which thing many times  I had much unrest, and rebuked myself as a base person: also, many  times I cursed the unsteadfastness of mine eyes, and said to them  inwardly: \"Was not your grievous condition of weeping wont one while  to make others weep? And will ye now forget this thing because a lady  looketh upon you? who so looketh merely in compassion of the grief ye  then showed for your own blessed lady. But whatso ye can, that do ye,  accursed eyes! many a time will I make you remember it! for never, till  death dry you up, should ye make an end of your weeping.\" And when  I had spoken thus unto mine eyes, I was taken again with extreme and  grievous sighing. And to the end that this inward strife which I had  undergone might not be hidden from all saving the miserable wretch who  endured it, I proposed to write a sonnet, and to comprehend in it this  horrible condition. And I wrote this which begins, \"The very bitter  weeping.\"    _The sonnet has two parts. In the first, I speak to my eyes, as my  heart spoke within myself. In the second, I remove a difficulty,  showing who it is that speaks thus: and this part begins here, \"So  far.\" It well might receive other divisions also; but this would be  useless, since it is manifest by the preceding exposition._        \"The very bitter weeping that ye made        So long a time together, eyes of mine,        Was wont to make the tears of pity shine      In other eyes full oft, as I have said.      But now this thing were scarce remembered        If I, on my part, foully would combine        With you, and not recall each ancient sign      Of grief, and her for whom your tears were shed      It is your fickleness that doth betray        My mind to fears, and makes me tremble thus          What while a lady greets me with her eyes.      Except by death, we must not any way        Forget our lady who is gone from us.\"          So far doth my heart utter, and then sighs.    The sight of this lady brought me into so unwonted a condition that  I often thought of her as of one too dear unto me; and I began to  consider her thus: \"This lady is young, beautiful, gentle, and wise;  perchance it was Love himself who set her in my path, that so my  life might find peace.\" And there were times when I thought yet more  fondly, until my heart consented unto its reasoning. But when it had  so consented, my thought would often turn round upon me, as moved by  reason, and cause me to say within myself: \"What hope is this which  would console me after so base a fashion, and which hath taken the  place of all other imagining?\" Also there was another voice within me,  that said: \"And wilt thou, having suffered so much tribulation through  Love, not escape while yet thou mayst from so much bitterness? Thou  must surely know that this thought carries with it the desire of Love,  and drew its life from the gentle eyes of that lady who vouchsafed  thee so much pity.\" Wherefore I, having striven sorely and very often  with myself, bethought me to say somewhat thereof in rhyme. And seeing  that in the battle of doubts, the victory most often remained with such  as inclined towards the lady of whom I speak, it seemed to me that I  should address this sonnet unto her: in the first line whereof, I call  that thought which spake of her a gentle thought, only because it spoke  of one who was gentle; being of itself most vile.[30]      [30] Boccaccio tells us that Dante was married to Gemma Donati         about a year after the death of Beatrice. Can Gemma then be         \"the lady of the window,\" his love for whom Dante so contemns?         Such a passing conjecture (when considered together with         the interpretation of this passage in Dante's later work,         the _Convito_) would of course imply an admission of what I         believe to lie at the heart of all true Dantesque commentary;         that is, the existence always of the actual events even         where the allegorical superstructure has been raised by Dante         himself.    _In this sonnet I make myself into two, according as my thoughts  were divided, one from the other. The one part I call Heart, that is,  appetite; the other, Soul, that is, reason; and I tell what one saith  to the other. And that it is fitting to call the appetite Heart, and  the reason Soul, is manifest enough to them to whom I wish this to be  open. True it is that, in the preceding sonnet, I take the part of  the Heart against the Eyes; and that appears contrary to what I say  in the present; and therefore I say that, there also, by the Heart I  mean appetite, because yet greater was my desire to remember my most  gentle lady than to see this other, although indeed I had some appetite  towards her, but it appeared slight: wherefrom it appears that the one  statement is not contrary to the other. This sonnet has three parts. In  the first, I begin to say to this lady how my desires turn all towards  her. In the second, I say how the Soul, that is, the reason, speaks to  the Heart, that is, to the appetite. In the third, I say how the latter  answers. The second"]]]
