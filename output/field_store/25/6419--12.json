About this time certain gentlemen in Canada began to be unenviably  known. I abstain from giving their names, because unaware of how far  they seconded this crime, if at all. But they seconded as infamous  things, such as cowardly raids from neutral territory into the states,  bank robbings, lake pirating, city burning, counterfeiting, railway  sundering, and the importation of yellow fever into peaceful and  unoffending communities. I make no charges against those whom I do not  know, but simply say that the confederate agents, Jacob Tompson, Larry  McDonald, Clement Clay, and some others, had already accomplished enough  villainy to make Wilkes Booth, on the first of the present year, believe  that he had but to seek an interview with them.    He visited the provinces once certainly, and three times it is believed,  stopping in Montreal at St. Lawrence Hall, and banking four hundred and  fifty-five dollars odd at the Ontario bank. This was his own money. I  have myself seen his bank-book with the single entry of this amount. It  was found in the room of Atzerott, at Kirkwood's Hotel. From this visit,  whatever encouragement Booth received, he continued in systematic  correspondence with one or more of those agents down to the commission  of his crime. I dare not say how far each of these agents was  implicated. My personal conviction is that they were neither loth to the  murder nor astonished when it had been done. They had money with  discretion from the confederacy, though acting at discretion and outside  of responsibility, and always, at every wild adventure, they instructed  their dupes that each man took his life in his hand on every incursion  into the north. So Beale took his, raiding on the great lakes. So  Kennedy took his, on a midnight bonfire-tramp into the metropolis. So  took the St. Albans raiders their lives in their palms, dashing into a  peaceful town. And if these agents entertained Wilkes Booth's suggestion  at all they plainly told him that he carried his life in his dagger's  edge, and could expect from them neither aid nor exculpation.    Some one or all of these agents furnished Booth with a murderer. The  fellow Wood or Payne, who stabbed Mr. Seward and was caught at Mrs.  Surratt's house in Washington. He was one of three Kentucky brothers,  all outlaws, and had himself, it is believed, accompanied one of his  brothers, who is known to have been at St. Albans on the day of the  bank-delivery. This Payne, besides being positively identified as the  assassin of the Sewards, had no friends nor haunts in Washington. He was  simply a dispatched murderer, and after the night of the crime, struck  northward of the frontier, instead of southward in the company of Booth.  The proof, of this will follow in the course of the article.    While I assert that the Canadian agents knew Booth and patted his back,  calling him, like Macbeth, the \"prince of cut-throats,\" I am equally  certain that Booth's project was unknown in Richmond. No word, nor  written line, no clue of any sort has been found attaching Booth to the  confederate authorities. The most that can be urged to meet preposterous  claims of this sort is, that out of the rebellion grew the murder; which  is like attributing the measles to the creation of man. But McDonald and  his party had money at discretion, and under their control the vilest  fellows on the continent. Their personal influence over those errant  ones amounted to omnipotence. Most of the latter were young and sanguine  people, like Beale and Booth; their plots were made up at St.  Catharine's, Toronto, and Montreal, and they have maintained since the  war began, rebel mail routes between Canada and Richmond, leading  directly passed Washington.    If Booth received no positive instructions, he was at any rate adjudged  a man likely to be of use, and therefore introduced to the rebel  agencies in and around Washington. Doubtless by direct letter, or verbal  instruction, he received a password to the house of Mrs. Surratt.    Half applauded, half rebuffed by the rebel agents in Canada, Booth's  impressions of his visit were just those which would whet him soonest  for the tragedy. His vanity had been fed by the assurance that success  depended upon himself alone, and that as he had the responsibility he  would absorb the fame; and the method of correspondence was of that  dark and mysterious shape which powerfully operated upon his dramatic  temperament.    What could please an actor, and the son of an actor, better than to  mingle as a principal in a real conspiracy, the aims of which were  pseudo-patriotic, and the end so astounding that at its coming the whole  globe would reel. Booth reasoned that the ancient world would not feel  more sensitively the death of Julius CÃ¦sar than the new the sudden  taking off of Abraham Lincoln.    And so he grew into the idea of murder. It became his business thought.  It was his recreation and his study. He had not worked half so hard for  histrionic success as for his terrible graduation into an assassin. He  had fought often on the boards, and seen men die in well-imitated  horror, with flowing blood upon his keen sword's edge, and the strong  stride of mimic victory with which he flourished his weapon at the  closing of the curtain. He embraced conspiracy like an old diplomatist,  and found in the woman and the spot subjects for emulation.    Southeast of Washington stretches a tapering peninsula, composed of four  fertile counties, which at the remote tip make Point Lookout, and do not  contain any town within them of more than a few hundred inhabitants.  Tobacco has ruined the land of these, and slavery has ruined the people.  Yet in the beginning they were of that splendid stock of Calvert and  Lord Baltimore, but retain to-day only the religion of the peaceful  founder. I mention it is an exceptional and remarkable fact, that every  conspirator in custody is by education a Catholic. These are our most  loyal citizens elsewhere, but the western shore of Maryland is a noxious  and pestilential place for patriotism. The county immediately outside of  the District of Columbia, to the south, is named Prince Gorgia's and the  pleasantest village of this county, close to Washington, is called  Surrattsville. This consists of a few cabins at a cross-road,  surrounding a fine old hotel, the master whereof, giving the settlement  his name, left the property to his wife, who for a long time carried it  on with indifferent success. Having a son and several daughters, she  moved to Washington soon after the beginning of the war and let the  tavern to a trusty friend--one John Lloyd. Surrattsville has gained  nothing in patronage or business from the war, except that it became at  an early date, a rebel postoffice. The great secret mail from Matthias  Creek, Virginia, to Port Tobacco, struck Surrattsville, and thence  headed off to the east to Washington, going meanderingly north. Of this  poet route Mrs. Surratt was a manageress; and John Lloyd, when he rented  her hotel, assumed the responsibility of looking out for the mail, as  well the duty of making Mrs. Surratt at home when she chose to visit  him.    So Surrattsville only ten miles from Washington, has been throughout the  war a sect of conspiracy. It was like a suburb of Richmond, reaching  quite up to the rival capital; and though the few Unionists on the  peninsula knew its reputation well enough, nothing of the sort came out  until the murder.    Treason never found a better agent than Mrs. Surratt. She is a large,  masculine, self-possessed female, mistress of her house, and as lithe a  rebel as Belle Boyd or Mrs. Greenhough. She has not the flippantry and  menace of the first, nor the social power of the second; but the  rebellion has found no fitter agent.    At her country tavern and Washington home Booth was made welcome, and  there began the muttered murder against the nation and mankind.    The acquaintance of Mrs. Surratt in Lower Maryland undoubtedly suggested  to Booth the route of escape, and made him known to his subsequent  accomplices. Last fall he visited the entire region, as far as  Leonardstown, in St. Mary's county, professing to be in search of land  but really hunting up confederates upon whom he could depend. At this  time he bought a map, a fellow to which I have seen among Atzerott's  effects, published at Buffalo for the rebel government, and marking at  hap-hazard all the Maryland villages, but without tracing the highroads  at all. The absence of these roads, it will be seen hereafter, very  nearly misled Booth during his crippled flight.    It could not but have struck Booth that this isolated part of Maryland  ignorant and rebel to the brim, without telegraph or railways, or direct  stage routes, belted with swamps and broken by dense timber, afforded  extraordinary opportunities for shelter and escape. Only the coast  survey had any adequate map of it; it was _ultima thule_ to all intents,  and treason might subsist in welcome upon it for a thousand years.    When Booth cast around him for assistance, he naturally selected those  men whom he could control. The first that recommended himself was one  Harold, a youth of inane and plastic character, carried away by the  example of an actor, and full of execrable quotations, going to show  that he was an imitator of the master spirit both in text and  admiration. This Harold was a gunner, and therefore versed in arms; he  had traversed the whole lower portion of Maryland, and was therefore a  geographer as well as a tool. His friends lived at every farmhouse  between Washington and Leonardsville, and he was respectably enough  connected, so as to make his association creditable as well as useful.    Harold, whose picture I have seen, is a dull-faced, shallow boy,  smooth-haired, and provincial; he had no money nor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#13)"],[1,"of  violent whirling motion. One would say that the whole glowing mass had  been spun about with tremendous velocity, or that it had been set  rotating so rapidly that it had become the victim of ``centrifugal  force,'' one huge fragment having broken loose and started to gyrate  off into space. Closer inspection shows that in addition to the  principal focus there are various smaller condensations scattered  through the mass. These are conspicuous in the spirals. Some of them  are stellar points, and but for the significance of their location we  might suppose them to be stars which happen to lie in a line between  us and the nebula. But when we observe how many of them follow most  faithfully the curves of the spirals we cannot but conclude that they  form an essential part of the phenomenon; it is not possible to  believe that their presence in such situations is merely fortuitous.  One of the outer spirals has at least a dozen of these star-like  points strung upon it; some of them sharp, small, and distinct, others  more blurred and nebulous, suggesting different stages of  condensation. Even the part which seems to have been flung loose from  the main mass has, in addition to its central condensation, at least  one stellar point gleaming in the half-vanished spire attached to it.  Some of the more distant stars scattered around the ``whirlpool'' look  as if they too had been shot out of the mighty vortex, afterward  condensing into unmistakable solar bodies. There are at least two  curved rows of minute stars a little beyond the periphery of the  luminous whirl which clearly follow lines concentric with those of the  nebulous spirals. Such facts are simply dumbfounding for anyone who  will bestow sufficient thought upon them, for these are suns, though  they may be small ones; and what a birth is that for a sun!    Look now again at the glowing spirals. We observe that hardly have  they left the central mass before they begin to coagulate. In some  places they have a ``ropy'' aspect; or they are like peascods filled  with growing seeds, which eventually will become stars. The great  focus itself shows a similar tendency, especially around its  circumference. The sense that it imparts of a tremendous shattering  force at work is overwhelming. There is probably more matter in that  whirling and bursting nebula than would suffice to make a hundred  solar systems! It must be confessed at once that there is no  confirmation of the Laplacean hypothesis here; but what hypothesis  will fit the facts? There is one which it has been claimed does so,  but we shall come to that later. In the meanwhile, as a preparation,  fix in the memory the appearance of that second spiral mass spinning  beside its master which seems to have spurned it away.    For a second example of the spiral nebulae look at the one in the  constellation Triangulum. God, how hath the imagination of puny man  failed to comprehend Thee! Here is creation through destruction with a  vengeance! The spiral form of the nebula is unmistakable, but it is  half obliterated amid the turmoil of flying masses hurled away on all  sides with tornadic fury. The focus itself is splitting asunder under  the intolerable strain, and in a little while, as time is reckoned in  the Cosmos, it will be gyrating into stars. And then look at the  cyclonic rain of already finished stars whirling round the outskirts  of the storm. Observe how scores of them are yet involved in the  fading streams of the nebulous spirals; see how they have been thrown  into vast loops and curves, of a beauty that half redeems the terror  of the spectacle enclosed within their lines -- like iridescent cirri  hovering about the edges of a hurricane. And so again are suns born!    Let us turn to the exquisite spiral in Ursa Major; how different its  aspect from that of the other! One would say that if the terrific coil  in Triangulum has all but destroyed itself in its fury, this one on  the contrary has just begun its self-demolition. As one gazes one  seems to see in it the smooth, swift, accelerating motion that  precedes catastrophe. The central part is still intact, dense, and  uniform in texture. How graceful are the spirals that smoothly rise  from its oval rim and, gemmed with little stars, wind off into the  darkness until they have become as delicate as threads of gossamer!  But at bottom the story told here is the same -- creation by gyration!    Compare with the above the curious mass in Cetus. Here the plane of  the whirling nebula nearly coincides with our line of sight and we see  the object at a low angle. It is far advanced and torn to shreds, and  if we could look at it perpendicularly to its plane it is evident that  it would closely resemble the spectacle in Triangulum.    Then take the famous Andromeda Nebula (see Frontispiece), which is so  vast that notwithstanding its immense distance even the naked eye  perceives it as an enigmatical wisp in the sky. Its image on the  sensitive plate is the masterpiece of astronomical photography; for  wild, incomprehensible beauty there is nothing that can be compared  with it. Here, if anywhere, we look upon the spectacle of creation in  one of its earliest stages. The Andromeda Nebula is apparently less  advanced toward transformation into stellar bodies than is that in  Triangulum. The immense crowd of stars sprinkled over it and its  neighborhood seem in the main to lie this side of the nebula, and  consequently to have no connection with it. But incipient stars (in  some places clusters of them) are seen in the nebulous rings, while  one or two huge masses seem to give promise of transformation into  stellar bodies of unusual magnitude. I say ``rings'' because although  the loops encompassing the Andromeda Nebula have been called spirals  by those who wish utterly to demolish Laplace's hypothesis, yet they  are not manifestly such, as can be seen on comparing them with the  undoubted spirals of the Lord Rosse Nebula. They look quite as much  like circles or ellipses seen at an angle of, say, fifteen or twenty  degrees to their plane. If they are truly elliptical they accord  fairly well with Laplace's idea, except that the scale of magnitude is  stupendous, and if the Andromeda Nebula is to become a solar system it  will surpass ours in grandeur beyond all possibility of comparison.    There is one circumstance connected with the spiral nebulae, and  conspicuous in the Andromeda Nebula on account of its brightness,  which makes the question of their origin still more puzzling; they all  show continuous spectra, which, as we have before remarked, indicate  that the mass from which the light comes is either solid or liquid, or  a gas under heavy pressure. Thus nebulae fall into two classes: the  ``white'' nebulae, giving a continuous spectrum; and the ``green''  nebulae whose spectra are distinctly gaseous. The Andromeda Nebula is  the great representative of the former class and the Orion Nebula of  the latter. The spectrum of the Andromeda Nebula has been interpreted  to mean that it consists not of luminous gas, but of a flock of stars  so distant that they are separately indistinguishable even with  powerful telescopes, just as the component stars of the Milky Way are  indistinguishable with the naked eye; and upon this has been based the  suggestion that what we see in Andromeda is an outer universe whose  stars form a series of elliptical garlands surrounding a central mass  of amazing richness. But this idea is unacceptable if for no other  reason than that, as just said, all the spiral nebulae possess the same  kind of spectrum, and probably no one would be disposed to regard them  all as outer universes. As we shall see later, the peculiarity of the  spectra of the spiral nebulae is appealed to in support of a modern  substitute for Laplace's hypothesis.    Finally, without having by any means exhausted the variety exhibited  by the spiral nebulae, let us turn to the great representative of the  other species, the Orion Nebula. In some ways this is even more  marvelous than the others. The early drawings with the telescope  failed to convey an adequate conception either of its sublimity or of  its complication of structure. It exists in a nebulous region of  space, since photographs show that nearly the whole constellation is  interwoven with faintly luminous coils. To behold the entry of the  great nebula into the field even of a small telescope is a startling  experience which never loses its novelty. As shown by the photographs,  it is an inscrutable chaos of perfectly amazing extent, where spiral  bands, radiating streaks, dense masses, and dark yawning gaps are  strangely intermingled without apparent order. In one place four  conspicuous little stars, better seen in a telescope than in the  photograph on account of the blurring produced by over-exposure, are  suggestively situated in the midst of a dark opening, and no observer  has ever felt any doubt that these stars have been formed from the  substance of the surrounding nebula. There are many other stars  scattered over its expanse which manifestly owe their origin to the  same source. But compare the general appearance of this nebula with  the others that we have studied, and remark the difference. If the  unmistakably spiral nebulae resemble bursting fly-wheels or grindstones  from whose perimeters torrents of sparks are flying, the Orion Nebula  rather recalls the aspect of a cloud of smoke and fragments produced  by the explosion of a shell. This idea is enforced by the look of the  outer portion farthest from the bright half of the nebula, where  sharply edged clouds with dark spaces behind seem to be billowing away  as if driven by a wind blowing from the center.    Next let us consider what scientific speculation has done in the  effort to explain these mysteries. Laplace's hypothesis can certainly  find no standing ground either in the Orion Nebula"]]]
