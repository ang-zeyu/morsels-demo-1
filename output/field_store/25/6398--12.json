They had not waited for the completion of the work of  translation in order to engage in preaching. They felt that the command  was already definite, and that the need of the world was urgent. As  they became more acquainted with the glorious truths which had been  opened to their minds through the bestowal of the Aaronic Priesthood  upon them, they became eager to obtain a better understanding of the  work of God and to enjoy further blessings and gifts in accordance with  the promise made to them.    Some time in the month of June, 1829, Peter, James and John, the  ancient disciples of our Lord and Savior, and who, under Him, held the  keys of that dispensation, appeared in glory to Joseph and conferred  upon him the apostleship to which they themselves had been ordained  by the Lord Jesus while in mortality. Then these holy personages  ordained Oliver to the same Priesthood. After they had departed,  Joseph re-ordained Oliver, and also accepted a re-ordination himself  at Oliver's hands. Thus was the Melchisedek Priesthood in purity and  power again received on earth. The gift of the Holy Ghost was sealed  upon the heads of the Prophet and his fellow-servant, and they enjoyed  its fullness of blessing. A momentous revelation soon followed from  the Lord; directed not only to Joseph, but to Oliver Cowdery and  David Whitmer, making known the calling of the apostles of the last  dispensation and bestowing instructions concerning the building up of  the Church of Christ, according to the fullness of the gospel.    So passed some months of blessing and industry. Truth was constantly  developed by study and reflection upon God's goodness and the mysteries  of His kingdom through the aid of revelation from Him. Much time was  also given to inquiring acquaintances and strangers who came to seek  for light. Whenever any person, being convinced of the truth of the  mission to which Joseph Smith had been called, solicited baptism at the  hands of the apostles, if Joseph became convinced of the sincerity and  worthiness of the applicant, the ordinance was administered in faith  and power. It never failed to produce its promised result.    Emma, the wife of the Prophet, had remained in Pennsylvania. After the  manuscript translation had been placed in the printer's hands, Joseph  found time to visit his wife. As fast as the truth was made known to  him through revelation, he communicated it unto her; he desired that  she might partake with him of the gifts which Heaven was bestowing. He  paid two or three visits to Harmony during the autumn of 1829, and the  succeeding winter; while Oliver, under Joseph's direction, gave close  attention to the printing and publishing of the Book of Mormon. Early  in the spring of 1830, the work was completed and the first edition of  the book was given to the world.    And at this time the hour was come for the establishment, after the  order revealed by God, of the Church of Christ once more upon the earth.        CHAPTER XII.    ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH AT FAYETTE--REVIEW OF THE PROPHET'S LABORS--  HIS UNPRETENTIOUS CHARACTER--THE COURAGE WHICH ANIMATED HIM WAS SHARED  BY HIS ASSOCIATES--THE WITNESSES AND EARLY MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH.    The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized on the  6th day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred  and thirty, in Fayette, Seneca County, in the state of New York. Six  persons were the original members: Joseph Smith the Prophet, Oliver  Cowdery, Hyrum Smith, Peter Whitmer, Jun., Samuel H. Smith, and David  Whitmer. Each of the men had already been baptized by direct authority  from Heaven. The organization was made on the day and after the pattern  dictated by God in a revelation given to Joseph Smith. The Church was  called after the name of Jesus Christ; because He so ordered. Jesus  accepted the Church, declared it to be His own, and empowered it to  minister on earth in His name.    The sacrament, under inspiration from Jesus Christ, was administered to  all who had thus taken upon them His name.    This was a day of great joy to Joseph--a joy which was shared by those  who became thus united with him in a holy work. It is also a day now  reverenced by hundreds of thousands of the human family; a day to be  held in sacred veneration throughout all the time to elapse until the  Messiah Himself shall come in glory to accept the Kingdom from the  hands of His authorized servants, and to give reward for all the woes  and the persecutions which men have heaped upon His chosen ones.    Joseph was at this time twenty-four years of age. A period of ten  years had passed since the hour in which the Father and Son had first  appeared in answer to his prayer. During the most of this time he had  been in close communication with the Heavens, and the organization of  the Church was but the accomplishment of a definite purpose of the  Almighty. Joseph had been led along, himself not knowing in complete  fullness to what great result his life and labors were tending. He  had only known to do the will of Heaven as expressed to him, and to  patiently await the future. Doubtless at this hour of the organization  he looked back with thanks and marvel at all which God had given for  the benefit of His children. From out of the false religions of the  earth the Lord had lifted this His servant, and had trained him from  boyhood in the way most pleasing to Him.    In the very manner of the restoration of the gospel, Joseph learned  that God requires even His elect to defer to the order and authority  instituted by Christ. The power by which Joseph Smith was baptized was  the same power by which every man must be baptized who has a membership  in the Church of Christ. That power had been taken from the earth,  leaving the human family without the authority to administer the  ordinances of the gospel during many centuries. No earthly being could  restore it, and none could use it until John the Baptist conferred  it in its fullness upon Joseph and also upon his fellow servant,  Oliver. There is something significant in the fact that the authority  to baptize was bestowed upon Joseph and Oliver by the same personage  who had stood in the waters of the Jordan about 1800 years before, to  immerse in that stream the earthly tabernacle of God's Only Begotten.  As Joseph had not been permitted to officiate in baptism, or to confer  the Aaronic Priesthood, until John had visited him and transmitted  that authority from Heaven, so after even this blessing had become his  own, he was unable to seal the gift of the Holy Ghost, or to ordain  an Elder, until after Peter, James and John had endowed him with the  Priesthood after the holy order of Melchisedek. And even after both  these holy orders of Priesthood were given to him, and he had ordained  Oliver unto them; even after he had beheld in vision the establishment  of the work of righteousness, he knew not how nor when the organization  of the Church should be accomplished. It was necessary that God should  define the mode and the principle of organization and should direct  each step to be taken in this establishment of His kingdom; and it was  not until He did this that Joseph knew in what manner to obtain the  restoration of the power which belongs to the body of the Saints in  Christ.    Joseph proceeded carefully, and exactly according to the instruction of  the Almighty, and he laid the foundation of a work which will endure as  long as earth shall last.    The people who thus became associated with Joseph were generally his  seniors, but there was no hesitation on their part in yielding him the  respect due to the representative of Christ on earth, and they united  in giving him a devotion which supported and blessed him from hour to  hour. Joseph was no longer an uncouth village lad, for the exalted  course of his life during the years in which he had walked under God's  guidance had elevated him intellectually until he was already the peer  of any man. No doubt at this hour he was lacking, as he had been in his  earlier youth, in the technical teachings of the schools; but he had a  deeper knowledge and a finer judgment than any possessed by the most  favored of all the students of the colleges. As a boy he may have been  no more potent in swaying the feelings and judgment of those with whom  he came in contact than were his fellow youths; but as a man of God,  clothed upon with the Priesthood, filled with zeal, noble in carriage,  majestic in deportment, no person could view him without bestowing  veneration. Such is the testimony of all who knew him at this time. It  is true that he had not yet received that broad culture, he had not  penetrated to the depths of theology, astronomy, and all the higher  sciences which govern the kingdom of Christ, and unto which the Spirit  of God eventually led him; but from his almost transparent face there  shone a light of such beauty and power, and from his lips there came  such words of divine promise to mankind, that his associates accorded  to him a greater respect than could have been elicited by the most  learned minister of earthly churches, or the most powerful ruler of  earthly kingdoms.    The men who were thus associated with him, and who thus freely tendered  him, as the vicegerent of God on earth, the highest devotion of their  souls, were not naturally enthusiasts in the matter of religion; nor  were they men who could be deceived. They were of Puritan ancestry and  demanded the conviction of their reason before yielding their faith.    That reason once convinced, they were men of such exalted courage that  they dared the ridicule of the pulpit and the anger of mobs, to voice  their convictions and to yield their adherence to the gospel.

Such musings soon gave way to others. 'Alas!' he muttered, 'my good old  tutor, who used to enter so deep into the controversy between Heydon and  Chambers on the subject of astrology, he would have looked upon the scene  with other eyes, and would have seriously endeavoured to discover from  the respective positions of these luminaries their probable effects on  the destiny of the new-born infant, as if the courses or emanations of  the stars superseded, or at least were co-ordinate with, Divine  Providence. Well, rest be with him! he instilled into me enough of  knowledge for erecting a scheme of nativity, and therefore will I  presently go about it.' So saying, and having noted the position of the  principal planetary bodies, Guy Mannering returned to the house. The  Laird met him in the parlour, and, acquainting him with great glee that  the boy was a fine healthy little fellow, seemed rather disposed to press  further conviviality. He admitted, however, Mannering's plea of  weariness, and, conducting him to his sleeping apartment, left him to  repose for the evening.              CHAPTER  IV        Come and see' trust thine own eyes      A fearful sign stands in the house of life,      An enemy a fiend lurks close behind      The radiance of thy planet O be warned!             COLERIDGE, from SCHILLER      The belief in astrology was almost universal in the middle of the  seventeenth century; it began to waver and become doubtful towards the  close of that period, and in the beginning of the eighteenth the art fell  into general disrepute, and even under general ridicule. Yet it still  retained many partizans even in the seats of learning. Grave and studious  men were loath to relinquish the calculations which had early become the  principal objects of their studies, and felt reluctant to descend from  the predominating height to which a supposed insight into futurity, by  the power of consulting abstract influences and conjunctions, had exalted  them over the rest of mankind.    Among those who cherished this imaginary privilege with undoubting faith  was an old clergyman with whom Mannering was placed during his youth. He  wasted his eyes in observing the stars, and his brains in calculations  upon their various combinations. His pupil, in early youth, naturally  caught some portion of his enthusiasm, and laboured for a time to make  himself master of the technical process of astrological research; so  that, before he became convinced of its absurdity, William Lilly himself  would have allowed him 'a curious fancy and piercing judgment in  resolving a question of nativity.'    On the present occasion he arose as early in the morning as the shortness  of the day permitted, and proceeded to calculate the nativity of the  young heir of Ellangowan. He undertook the task secundum artem, as well  to keep up appearances as from a sort of curiosity to know whether he yet  remembered, and could practise, the imaginary science. He accordingly  erected his scheme, or figure of heaven, divided into its twelve houses,  placed the planets therein according to the ephemeris, and rectified  their position to the hour and moment of the nativity. Without troubling  our readers with the general prognostications which judicial astrology  would have inferred from these circumstances, in this diagram there was  one significator which pressed remarkably upon our astrologer's  attention. Mars, having dignity in the cusp of the twelfth house,  threatened captivity or sudden and violent death to the native; and  Mannering, having recourse to those further rules by which diviners  pretend to ascertain the vehemency of this evil direction, observed from  the result that three periods would be particularly hazardous--his fifth,  his tenth, his twenty-first year.    It was somewhat remarkable that Mannering had once before tried a similar  piece of foolery at the instance of Sophia Wellwood, the young lady to  whom he was attached, and that a similar conjunction of planetary  influence threatened her with death or imprisonment in her thirty-ninth  year. She was at this time eighteen; so that, according to the result of  the scheme in both cases, the same year threatened her with the same  misfortune that was presaged to the native or infant whom that night had  introduced into the world. Struck with this coincidence, Mannering  repeated his calculations; and the result approximated the events  predicted, until at length the same month, and day of the month, seemed  assigned as the period of peril to both.    It will be readily believed that, in mentioning this circumstance, we lay  no weight whatever upon the pretended information thus conveyed. But it  often happens, such is our natural love for the marvellous, that we  willingly contribute our own efforts to beguile our better judgments.  Whether the coincidence which I have mentioned was really one of those  singular chances which sometimes happen against all ordinary  calculations; or whether Mannering, bewildered amid the arithmetical  labyrinth and technical jargon of astrology, had insensibly twice  followed the same clue to guide him out of the maze; or whether his  imagination, seduced by some point of apparent resemblance, lent its aid  to make the similitude between the two operations more exactly accurate  than it might otherwise have been, it is impossible to guess; but the  impression upon his mind that the results exactly corresponded was  vividly and indelibly strong.    He could not help feeling surprise at a coincidence so singular and  unexpected. 'Does the devil mingle in the dance, to avenge himself for  our trifling with an art said to be of magical origin? Or is it possible,  as Bacon and Sir Thomas Browne admit, that there is some truth in a sober  and regulated astrology, and that the influence of the stars is not to be  denied, though the due application of it by the knaves who pretend to  practise the art is greatly to be suspected?' A moment's consideration of  the subject induced him to dismiss this opinion as fantastical, and only  sanctioned by those learned men either because they durst not at once  shock the universal prejudices of their age, or because they themselves  were not altogether freed from the contagious influence of a prevailing  superstition. Yet the result of his calculations in these two instances  left so unpleasing an impression on his mind that, like Prospero, he  mentally relinquished his art, and resolved, neither in jest nor earnest,  ever again to practise judicial astrology.    He hesitated a good deal what he should say to the Laird of Ellangowan  concerning the horoscope of his first-born; and at length resolved  plainly to tell him the judgment which he had formed, at the same time  acquainting him with the futility of the rules of art on which he had  proceeded. With this resolution he walked out upon the terrace.    If the view of the scene around Ellangowan had been pleasing by  moonlight, it lost none of its beauty by the light of the morning sun.  The land, even in the month of November, smiled under its influence. A  steep but regular ascent led from the terrace to the neighbouring  eminence, and conducted Mannering to the front of the old castle. It  consisted of two massive round towers projecting deeply and darkly at the  extreme angles of a curtain, or flat wall, which united them, and thus  protecting the main entrance, that opened through a lofty arch in the  centre of the curtain into the inner court of the castle. The arms of the  family, carved in freestone, frowned over the gateway, and the portal  showed the spaces arranged by the architect for lowering the portcullis  and raising the drawbridge. A rude farm-gate, made of young fir-trees  nailed together, now formed the only safeguard of this once formidable  entrance. The esplanade in front of the castle commanded a noble  prospect.    The dreary scene of desolation through which Mannering's road had lain on  the preceding evening was excluded from the view by some rising ground,  and the landscape showed a pleasing alternation of hill and dale,  intersected by a river, which was in some places visible, and hidden in  others, where it rolled betwixt deep and wooded banks. The spire of a  church and the appearance of some houses indicated the situation of a  village at the place where the stream had its junction with the ocean.  The vales seemed well cultivated, the little inclosures into which they  were divided skirting the bottom of the hills, and sometimes carrying  their lines of straggling hedgerows a little way up the ascent. Above  these were green pastures, tenanted chiefly by herds of black cattle,  then the staple commodity of the country, whose distant low gave no  unpleasing animation to the landscape. The remoter hills were of a  sterner character, and, at still greater distance, swelled into mountains  of dark heath, bordering the horizon with a screen which gave a defined  and limited boundary to the cultivated country, and added at the same  time the pleasing idea that it was sequestered and solitary. The  sea-coast, which Mannering now saw in its extent, corresponded in variety  and beauty with the inland view. In some places it rose into tall rocks,  frequently crowned with the ruins of old buildings, towers, or beacons,  which, according to tradition, were placed within sight of each other,  that, in times of invasion or civil war, they might communicate by signal  for mutual defence and protection. Ellangowan Castle was by far the most  extensive and important of these ruins, and asserted from size and  situation the superiority which its founders were said"]]]
