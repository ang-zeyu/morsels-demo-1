Were you ever so much as     look'd upon by a lord or a lady, before I married you, but on the     Easter or Whitsun-holidays? and then out at the banquetting-house     window, when Ned Whiting or George Stone were at the stake?       TRUE: For Gods sake, let's go stave her off him.       MRS. OTT: Answer me to that. And did not I take you up from thence,     in an old greasy buff-doublet, with points, and green velvet     sleeves, out at the elbows? you forget this.       TRUE: She'll worry him, if we help not in time.       [THEY COME FORWARD.]       MRS. OTT: O, here are some of the gallants! Go to, behave yourself     distinctly, and with good morality: or, I protest, I will take     away your exhibition.       TRUE: By your leave, fair mistress Otter, I will be bold to enter     these gentlemen in your acquaintance.       MRS. OTT: It shall not be obnoxious, or difficil, sir.       TRUE: How does my noble captain? is the bull, bear, and horse in     rerum natura still?       OTT: Sir, sic visum superis.       MRS. OTT: I would you would but intimate them, do. Go your ways     in, and get toasts and butter made for the woodcocks. That's a fit     province for you.       [DRIVES HIM OFF.]       CLER: Alas, what a tyranny is this poor fellow married to!       TRUE: O, but the sport will be anon, when we get him loose.       DAUP: Dares he ever speak?       TRUE: No Anabaptist ever rail'd with the like license: but mark     her language in the mean time, I beseech you.       MRS. OTT: Gentlemen, you are very aptly come. My cousin, sir     Amorous, will be here briefly.       TRUE: In good time lady. Was not sir John Daw here, to ask for     him, and the company?       MRS. OTT: I cannot assure you, master Truewit. Here was a very     melancholy knight in a ruff, that demanded my subject for somebody,     a gentleman, I think.       CLER: Ay, that was he, lady.       MRS. OTT: But he departed straight, I can resolve you.       DAUP: What an excellent choice phrase this lady expresses in.       TRUE: O, sir, she is the only authentical courtier, that is not     naturally bred one, in the city.       MRS. OTT: You have taken that report upon trust, gentlemen.       TRUE: No, I assure you, the court governs it so, lady, in your     behalf.       MRS. OTT: I am the servant of the court and courtiers, sir.       TRUE: They are rather your idolaters.       MRS. OTT: Not so, sir.       [ENTER CUTBEARD.]       DAUP: How now, Cutbeard? any cross?       CUT: O, no, sir, omnia bene. 'Twas never better on the hinges;     all's sure. I have so pleased him with a curate, that he's gone     to't almost with the delight he hopes for soon.       DAUP: What is he for a vicar?       CUT: One that has catch'd a cold, sir, and can scarce be heard six     inches off; as if he spoke out of a bulrush that were not pick'd,     or his throat were full of pith: a fine quick fellow, and an     excellent barber of prayers. I came to tell you, sir, that you     might omnem movere lapidem, as they say, be ready with your     vexation.       DAUP: Gramercy, honest Cutbeard! be thereabouts with thy key,     to let us in.       CUT: I will not fail you, sir: ad manum.       [EXIT.]       TRUE: Well, I'll go watch my coaches.       CLER: Do; and we'll send Daw to you, if you meet him not.       [EXIT TRUEWIT.]       MRS. OTT: Is master Truewit gone?       DAUP: Yes, lady, there is some unfortunate business fallen out.       MRS. OTT: So I adjudged by the physiognomy of the fellow that came     in; and I had a dream last night too of a new pageant, and my lady     mayoress, which is always very ominous to me. I told it my lady     Haughty t'other day; when her honour came hither to see some     China stuffs: and she expounded it out of Artemidorus, and I have     found it since very true. It has done me many affronts.       CLER: Your dream, lady?       MRS. OTT: Yes, sir, any thing I do but dream of the city. It     stain'd me a damasque table-cloth, cost me eighteen pound, at one     time; and burnt me a black satin gown, as I stood by the fire,     at my lady Centaure's chamber in the college, another time. A     third time, at the lord's masque, it dropt all my wire and my     ruff with wax candle, that I could not go up to the banquet. A     fourth time, as I was taking coach to go to Ware, to meet a     friend, it dash'd me a new suit all over (a crimson satin     doublet, and black velvet skirts) with a brewer's horse, that     I was fain to go in and shift me, and kept my chamber a leash     of days for the anguish of it.       DAUP: These were dire mischances, lady.       CLER: I would not dwell in the city, an 'twere so fatal to me.       MRS. OTT: Yes sir, but I do take advice of my doctor to dream     of it as little as I can.       DAUP: You do well, mistress Otter.       MRS. OTT: Will it please you to enter the house farther,     gentlemen?       DAUP: And your favour, lady: but we stay to speak with a knight,     sir John Daw, who is here come. We shall follow you, lady.       MRS. OTT: At your own time, sir. It is my cousin sir Amorous his     feast--       DAUP: I know it, lady.       MRS. OTT: And mine together. But it is for his honour, and     therefore I take no name of it, more than of the place.       DAUP: You are a bounteous kinswoman.       MRS. OTT: Your servant, sir.       [EXIT.]       CLER [COMING FORWARD WITH DAW.]: Why, do not you know it, sir     John Daw?       DAW: No, I am a rook if I do.       CLER: I'll tell you then, she's married by this time. And, whereas     you were put in the head, that she was gone with sir Dauphine, I     assure you, sir Dauphine has been the noblest, honestest friend to     you, that ever gentleman of your quality could boast of. He has     discover'd the whole plot, and made your mistress so acknowledging,     and indeed so ashamed of her injury to you, that she desires you     to forgive her, and but grace her wedding with your presence     to-day--She is to be married to a very good fortune, she says, his     uncle, old Morose: and she will'd me in private to tell you, that     she shall be able to do you more favours, and with more security     now, than before.       DAW: Did she say so, i'faith?       CLER: Why, what do you think of me, sir John? ask sir Dauphine.       DAUP: Nay, I believe you.--Good sir Dauphine, did she desire me to     forgive her?       CLER: I assure you, sir John, she did.       DAW: Nay, then, I do with all my heart, and I'll be jovial.       CLER: Yes, for look you, sir, this was the injury to you. La-Foole     intended this feast to honour her bridal day, and made you the     property to invite the college ladies, and promise to bring her:     and then at the time she should have appear'd, as his friend, to     have given you the dor. Whereas now, Sir Dauphine has brought her     to a feeling of it, with this kind of satisfaction, that you shall     bring all the ladies to the place where she is, and be very     jovial; and there, she will have a dinner, which shall be in your     name: and so disappoint La-Foole, to make you good again, and, as     it were, a saver in the main.       DAW: As I am a knight, I honour her; and forgive her heartily.       CLER: About it then presently. Truewit is gone before to confront     the coaches, and to acquaint you with so much, if he meet you.     Join with him, and 'tis well.--     [ENTER SIR AMOROUS LAFOOLE.]     See; here comes your antagonist, but take you no notice, but be     very jovial.       LA-F: Are the ladies come, sir John Daw, and your mistress?     [EXIT DAW.]     --Sir Dauphine! you are exceeding welcome, and honest master     Clerimont. Where's my cousin? did you see no collegiates, gentlemen?       DAUP: Collegiates! do you not hear, sir Amorous, how you are abus'd?       LA-F: How, sir!       CLER: Will you speak so kindly to sir John Daw, that has done you     such an affront?       LA-F: Wherein, gentlemen? let me be a suitor to you to know, I     beseech you!       CLER: Why, sir, his mistress is married to-day to sir Dauphine's     uncle, your cousin's neighbour, and he has diverted all the ladies,     and all your company thither, to frustrate your provision, and stick     a disgrace upon you. He was here now to have enticed us away from     you too: but we told him his own, I think.       LA-F: Has sir John Daw wrong'd me so inhumanly?       DAUP: He has done it, sir Amorous, most maliciously and     treacherously: but, if youll be ruled by us, you shall quit him,     i'faith.       LA-F: Good gentlemen, I'll make one, believe it. How, I pray?       DAUP: Marry sir, get me your pheasants, and your godwits, and your     best meat, and dish it in silver dishes of your cousin's presently,     and say nothing, but clap me a clean towel about you, like a sewer;     and bare-headed, march afore it with a good confidence, ('tis but     over the way, hard by,) and we'll second you, where you shall set     it on the board, and bid them welcome to't, which shall shew 'tis     yours, and disgrace his preparation utterly: and, for your cousin,     whereas she should be troubled here at home with care of making and     giving welcome, she shall transfer all that labour thither, and be     a principal guest herself, sit rank'd with the college-honours, and     be honour'd, and have her health drunk as often, as bare and as     loud as the best of them.       LA-F: I'll go tell her presently. It shall be done, that's     resolved.       [EXIT.]       CLER: I thought he would not hear it out, but 'twould take him.       DAUP: Well, there be guests and meat now; how shall we do for     music?       CLER: The smell of the venison, going through the street, will     invite one noise of fiddlers or other.

[2]  Thereupon I laughed, and as I said nothing, Messer Alberto Bendedio, who  was a haughty man, flew into a rage and said: You are laughing at them,  are you? And I tell you that during the last thousand years there has  not been born a man capable of so much as copying them. I then, not  caring to deprive them of so eminent a reputation, kept silence, and  admired them with mute stupefaction. It was said to me in Rome by many  great lords, some of whom were my friends, that the work of which I have  been speaking was, in their opinion of marvellous excellence and genuine  antiquity; whereupon, emboldened by their praises, I revealed that I had  made them. As they would not believe it, and as I wished to prove that I  had spoken truth, I was obliged to bring evidence and to make new  drawings of the vases; for my word alone was not enough, inasmuch as  Maestro Giacomo had cunningly insisted upon carrying off the old  drawings with him. By this little job I earned a fair amount of money.    Note 1. Giacomo Berengario da Carpi was, in fact, a great physician,  surgeon, and student of anatomy. He is said to have been the first to  use mercury in the cure of syphilis, a disease which was devastating  Italy after the year 1495. He amassed a large fortune, which, when he  died at Ferrara about 1530, he bequeathed to the Duke there.    Note 2. See below, Book II. Chap. viii., for a full account of this  incident at Ferrara.    XXIX    THE PLAGUE went dragging on for many months, but I had as yet managed to  keep it at bay; for though several of my comrades were dead, I survived  in health and freedom. Now it chanced one evening that an intimate  comrade of mine brought home to supper a Bolognese prostitute named  Faustina. She was a very fine woman, but about thirty years of age; and  she had with her a little serving-girl of thirteen or fourteen. Faustina  belonging to my friend, I would not have touched her for all the gold in  the world; and though she declared she was madly in love with me, I  remained steadfast in my loyalty. But after they had gone to bed, I  stole away the little serving-girl, who was quite a fresh maid, and woe  to her if her mistress had known of it! The result was that I enjoyed a  very pleasant night, far more to my satisfaction than if I had passed it  with Faustina. I rose upon the hour of breaking fast, and felt tired,  for I had travelled many miles that night, and was wanting to take food,  when a crushing headache seized me; several boils appeared on my left  arm, together with a carbuncle which showed itself just beyond the palm  of the left hand where it joins the wrist. Everybody in the house was in  a panic; my friend, the cow and the calf, all fled. Left alone there  with my poor little prentice, who refused to abandon me, I felt stifled  at the heart, and made up my mind for certain I was a dead man.    Just then the father of the lad went by, who was physician to the  Cardinal Iacoacci, [1] and lived as member of that prelates household.  [2] The boy called out: Come, father, and see Benvenuto; he is in bed  with some trifling indisposition. Without thinking what my complaint  might be, the doctor came up at once, and when he had felt my pulse, he  saw and felt what was very contrary to his own wishes. Turning round to  his son, he said: O traitor of a child, youve ruined me; how can I  venture now into the Cardinals presence? His son made answer: Why,  father, this man my master is worth far more than all the cardinals in  Rome. Then the doctor turned to me and said: Since I am here, I will  consent to treat you. But of one thing only I warn you, that if you have  enjoyed a woman, you are doomed. To this I replied: I did so this very  night. He answered: With whom, and to what extent? [3] I said: Last  night, and with a girl in her earliest maturity. Upon this, perceiving  that he had spoken foolishly, he made haste to add: Well, considering  the sores are so new, and have not yet begun to stink, and that the  remedies will be taken in time, you need not be too much afraid, for I  have good hopes of curing you. When he had prescribed for me and gone  away, a very dear friend of mine, called Giovanni Rigogli, came in, who  fell to commiserating my great suffering and also my desertion by my  comrade, and said: Be of good cheer, my Benvenuto, for I will never  leave your side until I see you restored to health. I told him not to  come too close, since it was all over with me. Only I besought him to be  so kind as to take a considerable quantity of crowns, which were lying  in a little box near my bed, and when God had thought fit to remove me  from this world, to send them to my poor father, writing pleasantly to  him, in the way I too had done, so far as that appalling season of the  plague permitted. [4] My beloved friend declared that he had no  intention whatsoever of leaving me, and that come what might, in life or  death, he knew very well what was his duty toward a friend. And so we  went on by the help of God: and the admirable remedies which I had used  began to work a great improvement, and I soon came well out of that  dreadful sickness.    The sore was still open, with a plug of lint inside it and a plaster  above, when I went out riding on a little wild pony. He was covered with  hair four fingers long, and was exactly as big as a well-grown bear;  indeed he looked just like a bear. I rode out on him to visit the  painter Rosso, who was then living in the country, toward Civita  Vecchia, at a place of Count Anguillaras called Cervetera. I found my  friend, and he was very glad to see me; whereupon I said: I am come to  do to you that which you did to me so many months ago. He burst out  laughing, embraced and kissed me, and begged me for the Counts sake to  keep quiet. I stayed in that place about a month, with much content and  gladness, enjoying good wines and excellent food, and treated with the  greatest kindness by the Count; every day I used to ride out alone along  the seashore, where I dismounted, and filled my pockets with all sorts  of pebbles, snail shells, and sea shells of great rarity and beauty.    On the last day (for after this I went there no more) I was attacked by  a band of men, who had disguised themselves, and disembarked from a  Moorish privateer. When they thought that they had run me into a certain  passage, where it seemed impossible that I should escape from their  hands, I suddenly mounted my pony, resolved to be roasted or boiled  alive at that pass perilous, seeing I had little hope to evade one or  the other of these fates; [5] but, as God willed, my pony, who was the  same I have described above, took an incredibly wide jump, and brought  me off in safety, for which I heartily thanked God. I told the story to  the Count; he ran to arms; but we saw the galleys setting out to sea.  The next day following I went back sound and with good cheer to Rome.    Note 1. Probably Domenico Iacobacci, who obtained the hat in 1517.    Note 2. 'A sua provisione stava, i. e.,' he was in the Cardinals  regular pay.    Note 3. 'Quanto.' Perhaps we ought to read 'quando-when?'    Note 4. 'Come ancora io avevo fatto secondo lusanza che promettava  quell arrabbiata stagione.' I am not sure that I have given the right  sense in the text above. Leclanché interprets the words thus: that I  too had fared according to the wont of that appalling season, 'i. e.,'  had died of the plague. But I think the version in my sense is more true  both to Italian and to Cellinis special style.    Note 5. 'I. e.,' to escape either being drowned or shot.    XXX    THE PLAGUE had by this time almost died out, so that the survivors, when  they met together alive, rejoiced with much delight in one anothers  company. This led to the formation of a club of painters, sculptors, and  goldsmiths, the best that were in Rome; and the founder of it was a  sculptor with the name of Michel Agnolo. [1] He was a Sienese and a man  of great ability, who could hold his own against any other workman in  that art; but, above all, he was the most amusing comrade and the  heartiest good fellow in the universe. Of all the members of the club,  he was the eldest, and yet the youngest from the strength and vigour of  his body. We often came together; at the very least twice a week. I must  not omit to mention that our society counted Giulio Romano, the painter,  and Gian Francesco, both of them celebrated pupils of the mighty  Raffaello da Urbino.    After many and many merry meetings, it seemed good to our worthy  president that for the following Sunday we should repair to supper in  his house, and that each one of us should be obliged to bring with him  his crow (such was the nickname Michel Agnolo gave to women in the  club), and that whoso did not bring one should be sconced by paying a  supper to the whole company. Those of us who had no familiarity with  women of the town, were forced to purvey themselves at no small trouble  and expense, in order to appear without disgrace at that distinguished  feast of artists. I had reckoned upon being well provided with a young  woman of considerable beauty, called Pantasilea, who was very much in  love with me; but I was obliged to give her up to one of my dearest  friends, called Il Bachiacca, who on his side had been, and still was,  over head and ears in love with her. [2] This exchange excited a certain  amount of lovers anger, because the lady, seeing I had abandoned her at  Bachiaccas first entreaty, imagined that I held in slight esteem the  great affection which she bore me. In course of time a very serious  incident grew out of this misunderstanding, through her desire to take  revenge for the affront I had put upon her; whereof I shall speak  hereafter in the proper place.    Well, then, the hour was drawing nigh when we had to present ourselves  before that "]]]
