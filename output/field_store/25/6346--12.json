We were fortunate indeed to find such a refuge, as it was  large enough for the horses to graze on, and there was some good feed  upon it. By the time we had our tarpaulins fixed, and everything under  cover, the rain fell in earnest. The tributary passed this morning was  named Ellery's Creek. The actual distance we travelled to-day was  eighteen miles; to accomplish this we travelled from morn till night.  Although the rain continued at intervals all night, no great quantity  fell. In the morning the heavens were clear towards the south, but to  the north dense nimbus clouds covered the hills and darkened the sky.  Not removing the camp, I took another ramble into the hills to the  east of the camp, and from the first rise I saw what I was most  anxious to see, that is to say, the end, or rather the beginning of  the glen, which occurred at about two miles beyond our camp. Beyond  that the Finke came winding from the north-west, but clouds obscured a  distant view. It appeared that rain must still be falling north of us,  and we had to seek the shelter of our canvas home. At midday the whole  sky became overclouded, rain came slowly down, and when the night  again descended heavier still was then the fall. At an hour after  daylight on the morrow the greatest volume fell, and continued for  several hours. At midday it held up sufficiently to enable me to plant  some seeds of various trees, plants, vegetables, etc., given me  specially by Baron von Mueller. Among these were blue gum (tree),  cucumbers, melons, culinary vegetables, white maize, prairie grass,  sorghum, rye, and wattle-tree seeds, which I soaked before planting.  Although the rain lasted thirty-six hours in all, only about an inch  fell. It was with great pleasure that at last, on the 5th, we left the  glen behind us, and in a couple of miles debouched upon a plain, which  ran up to the foot of this line of ranges. The horses seemed to be  especially pleased to be on soft ground again. The length of this glen  is considerable, as it occupies 31 minutes of latitude. The main  bearing of it is nearly north 25 degrees west; it is the longest  feature of the kind I ever traversed, being over forty miles straight,  and over a hundred miles of actual travelling, and it appeared the  only pass through the range, which I named the Krichauff. To the north  a higher and more imposing chain existed, apparently about twenty  miles away. This northern chain must be the western portion of the  McDonnell Range. The river now is broader than in the glen; its bed,  however, is stony, and not boggy, the country level, sandy, and thinly  timbered, mostly all the vegetation being burnt by grass fires set  alight by the natives.    Travelling now upon the right bank of this stream, we cut off most of  the bends, which, however, were by no means so extensive or so  serpentine as in the glen or on the south side of it. Keeping near the  river bank, we met but little porcupine grass for the most part of the  day's stage, but there was abundance of it further off. The river took  us to the foot of the big mountains, and we camped about a mile below  a gorge through which it issues. As we neared the new hills, we became  aware that the late rains were raising the waters of the river. At six  miles before camping we crossed a tributary joining the Finke at right  angles from the west, where there are some ranges in that direction; a  slight stream was running down the bed. My next anxiety is to discover  where this river comes from, or whether its sources are to be found in  this chain. The day was delightfully fine and cool, the breezes seemed  to vibrate the echo of an air which Music, sleeping at her instrument,  had ceased to play. The ground is soft after the late rains. I said we  camped a mile below a gorge; at night I found my position to be in  latitude 23 degrees 40', and longitude 132 degrees 31', the variation  3 degrees east. We shot a few ducks, which were very fat and good.  This morning I took a walk into the hills to discover the best route  to take next. The high ranges north seem to be formed of three  separate lines, all running east and west; the most northerly being  the highest, rising over 2000 feet above the level of the surrounding  country, and, according to my barometrical and boiling-point  measurements, I found that at the Charlotte Waters I was 900 feet  above the sea. From that point up to the foot of these mountains the  country had steadily risen, as we traced the Finke, over 1000 feet, so  that the highest points of that range are over 4000 feet above sea  level; the most southerly of the three lines is composed of sandstone,  the middle and highest tiers I think change to granite. I climbed for  several hours over masses of hills, but always found one just a little  farther on to shut out the view. At length I reached the summit of a  high round mountain in the middle tier, and a most varied and splendid  panorama was spread before me, or I was spread before it.    To the north was the main chain, composed for the most part of  individual high mounts, there being a valley between them and the hill  I was on, and meandering along through this valley from the west I  could trace the course of the Finke by its timber for some miles. To  the east a mass of high and jumbled hills appeared, and one  bluff-faced mount was more conspicuous than the rest. Nearer to me,  and almost under my feet, was the gorge through which the river  passes, and it appears to be the only pass through this chain. I  approached the precipice overlooking the gorge, and found the channel  so flooded by the late rains, that it was impossible to get the horses  up through it. The hills which enclosed it were equally impracticable,  and it was utterly useless to try to get horses over them. The view to  the west was gratifying, for the ranges appeared to run on in  undiminished height in that direction, or a little north of it. From  the face of several of the hills climbed to-day, I saw streams of pure  water running, probably caused by the late rains. One hill I passed  over I found to be composed of puddingstone, that is to say, a  conglomeration of many kinds of stone mostly rounded and mixed up in a  mass, and formed by the smothered bubblings of some ancient and  ocean-quenched volcano. The surface of the place now more particularly  mentioned had been worn smooth by the action of the passage of water,  so that it presented the appearance of an enormous tessellated  pavement, before which the celebrated Roman one at Bognor, in Sussex,  which I remember, when I was a boy, on a visit to Goodwood, though  more artistically but not more fantastically arranged, would be  compelled to hide its diminished head. In the course of my rambles I  noticed a great quantity of beautiful flowers upon the hills, of  similar kinds to those collected in the Glen of Palms, and these  interested me so greatly, that the day passed before I was aware, and  I was made to remember the line, \"How noiseless falls the foot of Time  that only treads on flowers.\" I saw two kangaroos and one rock  wallaby, but they were too wild to allow me to approach near enough to  get a shot at them. When I said I walked to-day, I really started on  an old favourite horse called Cocky, that had carried me for years,  and many a day have I had to thank him for getting me out of  difficulties through his splendid powers of endurance. I soon found  the hills too rough for a horse, so fixing up his bridle, I said, \"Now  you stop there till I come back.\" I believe he knew everything I said,  for I used frequently to talk to him. When I came back at night, not  thinking he would stay, as the other horses were all feeding within  half a mile of him, there he was just as I had left him. I was quite  inclined to rest after my scrambles in the hills. During the night  nothing occurred to disturb our slumbers, which indeed were aided by  the sounds of the rippling stream, which sang to us a soothing song.      CHAPTER 1.3.

I had come to the decision, as it was impossible to follow the Finke  through the gorge in consequence of the flood, and as the hills were  equally impracticable, to fall back upon the tributary I had noticed  the day before yesterday as joining the river from the west, thinking  I might in twenty or thirty miles find a gap in the northern range  that would enable me to reach the Finke again. The night was very  cold, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4975"],[0,"Spinifex and Sand (#13)"],[1," morning. To such  men as these a map or compass is useless and therefore of no value; and  yet they are often spoken of by the ignorant as \"best bushmen in  Australia.\"    In my time I have seen and mixed with most prospectors in the West, and as  far as my experience goes the best bushmen not only use the compass, but  keep a reckoning, rough though it may be, of their day's travel. Such a  man is Billy Frost, to quote a well-known name on the goldfields, a man  who has had no chance to learn any of the rudiments of surveying, and who  started life as a boundary rider on a cattle station. He has shown me a  note-book in which he has jotted down directions and distances from water.    In mountainous country where landmarks are numerous the traveller may  manage it; but no man could travel for any length of time without keeping  some sort of reckoning, in a flat country like the interior of Western  Australia, where for days together one sees no hill or rise, without  before long becoming hopelessly lost.    Paddy Egan had been content to travel in this haphazard way, and it was  long before he would acknowledge the benefits of a compass and map. That  he could travel straight there was no gainsaying, for if, as I sometimes  did, I pointed out our line and sent him ahead, he would go as straight as  a die, with now and then a glance at the sun, and a slight alteration in  his course to allow for its altered position, and require but little  correction. Indeed, even when using a compass, one instinctively pays as  much and more attention to the sun or the stars, as the case may be.    The rock-hole at Beri was dry, so we pushed on for Lake Roe, and, though  we worked sinking holes until past midnight, and nearly the whole of the  next day, we were unable to find water. It was only salt water we  expected, but a stiff pipeclay, continuing to a depth too great for our  limited means of sinking, baffled all our efforts. I followed the lake  some six miles to the eastward, carrying a shovel and digging trial holes  at intervals, but this pipeclay foiled me everywhere.    I do not know how far this lake runs east, and fancy its limits have never  been laid down on the map; not that there is anything sufficiently  inviting in its appearance--the usual flat expanse of mud, with banks of  sand fringed with low straggling mallee and spinifex--to warrant further  investigation.    Lake Roe having failed us, we turned on our tracks for the nearest point  of Lake Lapage, some nine miles distant. Here we were more fortunate, and  obtained a splendid supply of salt water at a depth of only three feet.  Timber was not easily got--that would have been too much joy! It had to  be carried nearly half a mile on our shoulders, for the camels, having  travelled all day, deserved a rest. The condensers worked well, now that  we had had some experience, and produced water at the rate of four gallons  an hour. With our casks replenished and our camels filled, leaving the  condenser standing, we turned south to some hills that were visible; we  intended to be absent for four days, at the end of which the camels would  again require water, as the weather was exceedingly hot.    Nothing of interest was met with until we came upon a huge wall-like reef,  standing some fifteen or twenty feet above the ground, from ten to twenty  feet wide, and running almost due north and south for nearly five miles,  without a break of appreciable extent, as we subsequently found. Breaking  the quartz at intervals, hoping at each blow of the pick to see the  longed-for colours, we followed this curious natural wall, and finally  camped, sheltered by it from the wind. A violent storm of dust, wind,  thunder, and lightning swept over us that night, tearing the \"fly\" we had  pitched, in the vain expectation of rain, into ribbons.    Leaving the others to continue prospecting, I turned my steps, or rather  those of Satan, whom I was riding, towards Cowarna, a large granite rock,  some fourteen miles distant, and due south from our camp, if I had  reckoned our position on the map correctly. Twelve miles of open forest,  alternating with scrubby thickets, brought me to the edge of a fine little  plain of saltbush and grass, from the centre of which a bare rock of  granite stood out. Arrived at the rock, I hunted long and diligently for  water. Numerous rock-holes were to be seen, but all were dry, and my hopes  of making this our base from which to prospect in various directions were  at first short-lived; but before long I was overjoyed to hear the  twittering of a little flock of Diamond sparrows--a nearly certain sign  that water must be handy; and sure enough I found their supply at the  bottom of a narrow, round hole, down which I could just stretch my arm.          CHAPTER II        GRANITE ROCKS, \"NAMMA HOLES,\" AND \"SOAKS\"      At this point it may not be amiss to give a short description of these  peculiar outcrops of granite, without which the track from York to  Coolgardie could never have been kept open, nor the place discovered, nor  could its early inhabitants have supported life before the condensing  plant came into general use.    The interior of the Colony, between the coast and a point some hundred  miles east of Coolgardie, is traversed by parallel belts of granite,  running in a general direction of north-north-west and south-south-east.  This granite crops out above the surface, at intervals of from ten to  twenty or thirty miles, sometimes in the form of an isolated barren rock,  and sometimes as low ranges and hills several miles in extent. From them  small creeks, and sometimes larger watercourses, run down, to find their  way into the stony and gravelly debris which usually surrounds the rocks.  Much of what little rain does fall is absorbed by the trees and scrub,  and much is taken by the sun's heat, so that a very small proportion can  sink below the surface soil, and only when there is some underground basin  in the rock beneath will water be found by sinking, except immediately  after rain.    Round the granite base a belt of grass of no great extent may be found,  for the most part dry and yellow, but in places green and fresh. It is in  such spots as these that one may hope to tap an underground reservoir in  the rock. To these shallow wells has been given the name of \"Soaks.\"  They seldom exceed fifteen feet in depth, though similar subterranean  basins have been tapped by a well perhaps a hundred feet deep, sunk some  distance from the foot of the outcrop. A good soak will stand a heavy  drain for perhaps months, but not having its origin in a spring the supply  ultimately ceases.    The soil, being alluvial, is in most cases easy to dig, and when the bed  rock is reached it becomes an open question whether to go deeper into the  decomposed rock or to be content with what supply has been struck. Many a  good soak has been ruined by a too ambitious worker, who, after infinite  toil, may see his priceless fluid disappear down some hidden crack  beneath. Native soaks dug out with sticks and wooden \"coolimans\"--small  troughs used as spades or as a means of carrying seeds, water, or  game--are by no means uncommon, and, when holding water, are easily made  more serviceable by throwing out a few shovelsful of sticks, stones, and  sand, with which they are generally choked. Often the weary traveller has  no such lucky help, and must set to work to dig a soak for himself and his  thirsty beasts--against time, too, in a blazing sun, without the  comforting knowledge that there is any certainty of finding water. I do  not know of any case when a party has actually perished at the mouth of  a waterless soak, but in many instances water has been struck when all  hope had been given up. The skeletons and carcasses of camels and horses  tell a tale of suffering that no man who has travelled can look at  unmoved, and go to show that many a beast of burden has been less  fortunate than his masters.    With what eager anxiety the shovelsful are watched, when the expected  \"bottom\" is nearly reached, by man and beast alike, who, utterly weary and  absolutely parched, know that they are soon to learn their fate. The  horses snort and plunge in eager and impatient expectation, whilst the  patient camel contents himself with grunts and moans, though, as his knees  are probably strapped beneath him, he cannot protest more forcibly. At  length, perhaps, all are rewarded by the welcome sight of a tiny trickle  in one corner, or perhaps the hole turns out a \"duffer,\" and the weary,  weary work must be commenced again in a fresh spot.    In many cases these granite rocks have been utilised as a catchment area  for tanks, into which the water is led by drains, which encircle the foot  of the outcrop. Before the railway was built, such tanks, sunk by  Government along the Southern Cross-Coolgardie track, enabled teamsters to  bring their horses through with safety, which would otherwise have been  impossible at some seasons of the year.    I append a table showing cost and contents of Government tanks excavated  at the base of granite rocks between Southern Cross and Coolgardie:--       Name of Reservoir.      Cost (pounds).
