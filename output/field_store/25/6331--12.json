Faster, faster!\"    But how on earth can he go faster? His lips barely move; he has given  up enunciating altogether,--unless, forsooth, he chooses to cheat  the Lord, and swindle him out of his Mass. And that is just what he  is doing, the wretched man! Yielding first to one temptation, then  another, he skips one verse, then two; then the Epistle being very  long, he omits part of it, skims over the Gospel, passes the Creed  unnoticed, skips the _Pater_, hails the preface from afar, and thus  with a skip and a jump plunges into eternal damnation, followed by  that infamous Garrigou (_Vade retro, Satanas!_), who seconds him with  marvellous sympathy, upholds his chasuble, turns the pages two at a  time, jostles the lectern, and upsets the vases, while the little  bell rings constantly, ever faster and louder.    It would be impossible to describe the bewildered expression of the  congregation. Compelled to follow, mimicking the priest, through  this Mass, of which they can make neither head nor tail, some stand  while others kneel, some sit while others stand; and all the phases  of this singular service are jumbled together along the benches in  the greatest confusion of varied postures. The Christmas star on the  celestial road, journeying toward the little manger yonder, grows  pale at the very thought.    \"The abbé reads too fast; it is impossible to follow him,\" whispers  the old dowager Marchioness, whose voluminous head-dress shakes  wildly. Master Arnoton, with his great steel spectacles on his nose,  loses his place every minute and fingers his Prayer-Book nervously.  Still, at heart all these good people, whose minds are equally bent  upon the Christmas supper, are not at all disturbed at the idea  of following Mass at such breakneck speed; and when Dom Balaguère,  facing them radiantly, exclaims in a thundering voice, \"Ite missa  est,\" the response, \"Deo gracias,\" is so unanimous, joyous, and  spirited, that any one might take it for the first toast of the  supper.      III.    Five minutes later the assembled lords, and the chaplain among them,  had taken their seats in the great hall. The castle, brilliantly  illumined, echoed with songs and laughter; and the venerable Dom  Balaguère drove his fork resolutely into a capon's wing, drowning the  remorse for his sin in the savory juice of meats and the soothing  draughts of old wine. He ate and drank so heartily, the dear good  man, that he died of a spasm that very night, without even having had  time to repent. By morning he reached heaven, where the thrills of  the past night's ecstasies lingered still in the air, and I leave you  to imagine how he was received.    \"Get thee gone, thou wretched Christian!\" said Saint Peter; \"thy sin  is great enough to wipe out the virtues of a lifetime! Ah, so thou  wouldst swindle us out of a Mass! Very well, then, three hundred  Masses shalt thou say, nor shalt thou enter into Paradise until  three hundred Christmas Masses have been celebrated in thine own  chapel, and in the presence of all those who sinned with thee and  through thee.\"    And this is the true legend of Dom Balaguère, as it is told in the  land of the olive-tree. The castle of Trinquelague has long ceased  to exist; but the chapel stands erect on the crest of Mount Ventoux,  in a clump of evergreen oaks. The wind sways its unhinged door; the  grass grows over the threshold; there are nests in the angles of the  altar, and on the sills of the high ogive windows, whose jewelled  panes have long since disappeared. Still, it seems that every year  at Christmas supernatural, mysterious lights hover among the ruins;  and on their way to midnight Mass and the Christmas supper, the  peasants see this spectre of a chapel lighted by invisible tapers,  which burn in the open air, even in the wind and under the snow. You  may laugh if you will, but a wine-dresser of the district, named  Garrigue, a descendant of Garrigou, no doubt, has often told me that  on one particular Christmas night, being somewhat in liquor, he  had lost his way on the mountain somewhere near Trinquelague, and  this is what he saw: until eleven o'clock nothing. Everything was  silent and dark. Suddenly at midnight the chimes rang out from the  old steeple,--strange, uncanny chimes, that seemed to be ringing a  thousand miles away. Soon lights began to tremble along the road, and  vague shadows moved about. Under the portal of the chapel there were  sounds of footsteps and muffled voices:--    \"Good-night, Master Arnoton!\"    \"Good-night, good-night, my children!\"    When they had all gone in, my wine-dresser, who was a courageous  fellow, crawled up to the door and there beheld a most marvellous  spectacle. All these good shadows sat around the choir in the ruined  nave just as though the benches were still there. There were fine  ladies in brocades and lace head-dresses, lords gayly bedizened,  peasants in flowered coats like those our grandfathers wore, all of  them dusty, faded, weary. Every now and then, some night-bird, an  habitual lodger in the chapel, awakened by all these lights, began to  flutter about the tapers, whose flames rose erect and vague as though  they were burning behind a strip of gauze. Garrigue was particularly  amused at a gentleman with great steel spectacles, who constantly  shook his huge black wig, upon which perched one of these birds with  entangled claws and beating wings.    A little old man with a childlike figure knelt in the centre of the  choir and frantically shook a tiny bell which had lost its voice,  while a priest clad in old-gold vestments moved hither and thither  before the altar repeating orisons of which not a syllable could be  heard.    Who could this have been but Dom Balaguère, saying his third Low Mass?    [Illustration]          THE POET'S CHRISTMAS EVE.    From the Spanish of PEDRO A. DE ALARCÓN.        In a beautiful corner of Andalusia      Lies a smiling valley.          God bless it!      For in that valley      Have I friends, loves,      Brothers, parents.                      (_El Látigo._)      I.    A good many years ago, for I was then only seven, my father came to  me in the twilight of a winter's day, when the three _Ave Marias_ had  been repeated to the sound of the church-bells, and said solemnly,  \"You need not go to bed with the chickens to-night, Pedro; you are a  big boy now, and you ought to have supper with your parents and your  older brothers. This is Christmas Eve.\"    I shall never forget the delight with which I heard these words. I  was not going to bed until late! I cast a glance of commiseration  and contempt upon my younger brothers, and instantly fell to  composing a description, to be delivered at school on my return after  Twelfth Night, of this my first adventure, my first lark, the first  dissipation of my life.      II.    It was already _las Ánimas_,[1] as they say in our village.    [1] A certain hour of the evening, when the ringing of bells  admonishes the faithful to pray for the souls in purgatory.    Our village! Ninety leagues from Madrid, a thousand leagues from the  world, nestling in a fold of the Sierra Nevada! I can almost fancy I  see you, brothers, father, and mother!    A huge oak log whistled and crackled in the fireplace. We all sat  together under the vault of the chimney. My two grandmothers, who  spent that night with us, presiding over the household ceremonies,  occupied the corner seats; my father and mother sat next to them,  the rest of the place being occupied by the children and servants;  for on such an occasion we all represented the home, and it seemed  fitting that one fire should warm us all. I remember, however, that  our men remained standing, and that our maids squatted or knelt.  Their respectful humility forbade their occupying a chair. The cats  slept in the centre of the circle, their tails turned to the fire.  An occasional snowflake came fluttering down the chimney,--that  elfin road,--and the wind moaned in the distance and spoke to us of  the absent, the poor, the wayfarers. My father and my eldest sister  played on the harp, and I accompanied them, to their distress, on  a drum which I had contrived that very evening out of a broken  water-jug.    Do you know the song of the Aguinaldos, which is sung in the villages  that lie east of the Mulhacem? Well, that was the music that  constituted the concert. The maid-servants took it upon themselves to  render the vocal parts, and they sang couplets to this effect:--        \"To-night is Christmas eve;        To-morrow is Christmas day.      Maria, fetch the jug of wine;        Let's be merry while we may.\"    And all was happiness and merry-making. Rusks, butter-cakes, pastes  of nuts and honey, sweetmeats made by the nuns, rosoli, and cherry  brandy were freely passed around. There was much talk of going to  midnight Mass, to the Nativity play at dawn, to see the Bethlehem  manger which we boys had constructed in the tower, and also of  making sherbet out of the snow that carpeted the court.    Suddenly in the midst of all this merriment I was struck by the deep  meaning of these words, sung by my paternal grandmother:--          \"Christmas comes,        Christmas goes;      But soon we all shall be of those        Who come back--never!\"    In spite of my tender age this couplet chilled my heart. All the  melancholy horizons of life seemed to have been unfolded before me in  a flash. It was a burst of intuition, unnatural at my age; it was a  miraculous prescience, the herald of the ineffable tedium of poetry;  it was my first inspiration. I saw and understood at a glance, with  marvellous lucidity, the inevitable fate of the three generations  present. It occurred to me that my grandparents, my parents, and my  brothers were like a marching army whose vanguard was stepping into  the grave, while the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47338"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 1 (of 3) (#13)"],[1,"to express his feelings, but that English oaths are  too blasphemous, while all the people in A---- are firmly convinced  that his strange outbursts are far too bad to be translated.\"    \"Now then, Miss Vernon,\" said Mr. Winter, \"if you have finished that  conference with Captain Egerton--\"    \"_Maestro mio_, I am ready.\"    Winter gave a flourish of his bow and stamped his foot; Miss Vernon  played a brilliant prelude, and they began.    I sat in a pleasant dreamy state, listening to the music, and  indistinctly observing there was something wanting in Mr. Winter's  handsome drawing room that Kate Vernon's had; as if neatness was there  kept in her proper position of handmaid to the Graces; but here she  appeared to have risen up against her mistresses, and driven them out  of doors with a duster! I was disturbed from this placid state of mind  by the nodding of Miss Araminta Cox's yellow turban most distractingly  out of tune; and finding it insupportable I was about to change my  position, when the performance came to a conclusion.    The whist party now arranged themselves, leaving the piano to Kate,  Gilpin, and myself; and after a little desultory conversation Miss  Vernon acceded to our request for a song.    \"The Serenade,\" I petitioned.    \"You will be tired of that; I will give you a newer song.\" And she sung  us a little sparkling Neapolitan air full of expression and piquancy.  Winter had brought it from Italy, she said, and then we talked of his  studio, and his whims, and then we glanced at national characteristics,  and a hundred pleasant general topics. I felt surprised at the current  of deep thought that flowed through all the organist said; there  was much originality, too, in his observations; altogether our talk  insensibly assumed a grave tone, yet it was interesting, for we were  not making conversation. The conviction that my companions viewed life  differently from myself somewhat inclined me to silence. They seemed  to possess in themselves some source of internal satisfaction, of  constant interest, unaccountable to me, and utterly dissimilar to the  alternations of feverish excitement and profound ennui in which my days  and those of almost all my companions were passed.    Meanwhile the whist party progressed, with an occasional outburst from,  and overhauling of the tricks by, Winter, and divers complimentary  remarks from the Colonel to the ladies; finally a tray of sandwiches  and wine and water ended the entertainment.    \"What is the name of the white pony, Mr. Winter?\" said Kate.    \"Whatever you like.\"    \"Spatter the Dew,\" suggested the Colonel.    \"That is quite poetical, grandpapa.\"    \"My father had a horse called Toby,\" said Miss Araminta Cox in a  mincing voice.    \"Cyclops, they say, had only one eye,\" I observed.    \"I tell you he has the use of two,\" said Winter hastily.    \"That is not quite clear, and Cyclops is a fine sounding name,\" said  Kate, \"I vote for Cyclops, and I shall drink his health in a glass of  your gooseberry wine, Mr. Winter.\"    \"Cyclops, be it then,\" sighed Winter resignedly. \"Captain Egerton,  you must drink Miss Vernon's toast, but not in her beverage; here's  some port wine I'll answer for, I bought it myself in Oporto.\" We all  drank success to Cyclops, and bidding our kind host and hostess good  night, strolled home by moonlight. Ah! a delicious walk. Gilpin took  the Colonel's arm, and Kate accepted mine. The glorious moon, not yet  risen to her highest altitude, threw out the lacelike tracery of the  cathedral towers into strong relief--silvering the walls here and  there, leaving large masses of deep shadow, while the old gateways and  arches looked like openings into an abyss of darkness. A few light  clouds floated in the deep blue sky. We walked on for some moments in  silence.    \"The last time your hand rested on my arm, Miss Vernon, I little  thought I should so soon discover what you would not reveal.\"    \"How?\"    \"Do you not remember how perversely you kept silence when I wanted to  find out your abode?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" with a laugh, \"I was so afraid you would have found out  my trick, that I took care to obey poor Mrs. Winter's commands. How  strangely it all turned out!\"    Not much more passed between us until we passed the old church yard,  where the organist left us.    \"Scarcely late enough for ghosts,\" said the Colonel, with a smile, \"but  Kate would rather like to meet one.\"    \"Not I,\" said Miss Vernon; \"anything troubled, as ghosts always are,  would be terribly out of place this calm heavenly night; though to be  sure we have a black monk who walks up and down our garden from sunset  till cock crow.\"    \"There is something strangely attractive in the romantic antiquity  of your domicile. I fancy it must exercise some influence on one's  spirits,\" said I, smiling.    \"Indeed, Captain Egerton, I often tell grandpapa that I am sure we are  influenced by locality as well as everything else.\"    We paused at the wicket gate.    \"I was endeavouring to make out that inscription this morning, Colonel,\"  said I.    \"You can almost read it now, the moon shines so full upon it,\" observed  Kate. \"If you knew the text you would have made it out at once. See, at  this side there is the _Beati mundo corde_ quite plain, and round here  can you not trace _Deum videbunt_?\"    \"Ah, yes; of course, now you point it out.\"    \"This is the proper light to read it by,\" said Miss Vernon,  thoughtfully, \"and do you know I sometimes like to think the  entrance to our house is, as it were, sanctified by that beautiful  sentence--'Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God!'\"    \"Ah, enthusiast!\" said her grandfather, laughing and shaking his head,  \"Dragoons do not quite comprehend such fancies.\"    I could see the soft colour mount into her cheek as if she had betrayed  herself.    \"Do you believe him, Miss Vernon?\" I asked eagerly.    \"I do not know; good night.\"    \"Good night, Egerton, you dine with us to-morrow; you can take the train  to Carrington afterwards, you know.\"    \"Thank you, Colonel, with pleasure; good night.\"    The wicket closed on them, and I remained for some minutes in the  full, clear, calm light, gazing at the half-defaced letters, and  recalling the tones of Miss Vernon's expressive and musical voice, as  she pronounced the (as I thought) appropriate words which formed the  inscription. And then I strolled on slowly to my hotel, thinking more  seriously than is usual to me, and finally fell asleep and dreamt I was  riding across the sea to Dungar on Winter's white pony, which did not  strike me as anything uncommon.          CHAPTER VI.    REACTION.      Another day of calm and deep enjoyment.    I took my way to the Priory House at a very early hour, in order to  make the sketch I had promised Miss Vernon. She was reading to her  grandfather when I arrived, and welcomed me joyously, entering with  eager interest into my preparations for drawing, and the various  questions which arose as to the objects to be taken in, &c., in a  way, too, which showed some knowledge of the art; and hour after  hour slipped by as I sat before the window, sometimes laying down my  pencil to talk with the Colonel, sometimes caressing his fine old  dog, who appeared to have established a species of guard over me;  while Kate, constantly watchful of my progress, flitted backwards and  forwards between me and the open window, often pointing with her rosy  forefinger to some shading she wished deepened, or some light brought  into stronger relief; branching off from discussions on the effects  of distance, &c., into all sorts of irrelevant subjects, then blaming  herself for interrupting me, and exhorting me to renewed diligence;  and all this so naturally, so earnestly, showing openly her pleasure  at having me to talk to, but without one shadow of that indescribable  consciousness by which so many women seem to say to themselves, \"Now I  know he is going to make love to me.\" No, strongly as I felt tempted  to do so, there was a frankness and repose in Miss Vernon's manner I  would not for worlds have disturbed by even a whisper of the profound  admiration she inspired.    Something of the high principled and unselfish tone pervading the  society into which I had fallen, appeared to influence me with more of  thought for future consequences than was my usual habit; besides, there  is nothing so blighting to sentimentalism as the friendly cordiality I  have described; nevertheless, though I do not believe I was ever before  so long in the society of a beautiful girl without getting up some  degree of flirtation, the morning flew rapidly and delightfully away.    The Colonel had letters to write, and his granddaughter's visits to  my impromptu studio, if fewer, were more confidential. She told me  of the long visits she had paid to Lady Desmond, both in London and  Dublin, and of the delightful singing lessons she had taken in the  former place, adding that she owed her first and last peep at the great  and gay world to her cousin. It appeared that Lady Desmond had been  displeased with her for returning to Dungar, and had not written to  her for a long time. \"But you know,\" said Kate, \"grandpapa was about  to leave Dungar then, and I could not let him do so alone, nor go away  without a last look at my old happy home.\" All this was told in a low  tone, as if she did not wish the Colonel to overhear it, and in a  confidential manner inexpressibly delightful to me. She had knelt down  to caress Cormac, and after remaining for some seconds rolling up his  long ear thoughtfully, looked up suddenly in my face and added, \"I did  not intend to bore you with such a long prose about my difficulties  with Georgina; the reason I mentioned the subject at all was because  I heard you tell grandpapa you had a sister at Naples. Lady Desmond  was there, I heard, about a month ago, and I wish you would ask your  sister, when you write, if she "]]]
