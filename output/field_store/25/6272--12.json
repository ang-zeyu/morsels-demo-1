At last Don Gome aimed a terrible blow at  his adversary, which the sword of Rodrigo did not altogether succeed in  warding off, and he felt the blood running down his face. This advantage  gained by his enemy, far from discouraging him, only inflamed his anger  more and more, and lent new strength to his arm, new breath to his  lungs, and increased agility to his limbs.    [1] Strong, lusty.    At that moment a cry of agony was heard from the mansion of the count, a  cry which the clashings of the steels, increasing in rapidity and  force, fortunately prevented Rodrigo from hearing. We say fortunately,  for if he had heard it, his heart would have become so troubled, that  the good sword, which he had consecrated by a reverent kiss when he  received it from his father, might have fallen from his hand. Yes; such  would likely have happened to Rodrigo, for it was Ximena who had uttered  that agonised exclamation, when, having gone to the window of her  chamber, she saw her father and her lover fighting so fiercely; when she  saw the visage of Rodrigo bathed in blood, and perceived with the eyes  of her soul that her hopes of happiness had now indeed vanished for  ever; for her misery was certain whichever succumbed--her father or  Rodrigo. Of what use would life be to her without the latter? And if her  father fell, how could she marry his slayer? Not in vain had she said,  but a short time before, that an almost impassable abyss had opened  between her house and that of Diego Lainez.    The combat, in the meantime, was raging even more fiercely than before,  and its end was evidently approaching, as the combatants, panting and  covered with blood, instead now of defending themselves, were  endeavouring, to their very utmost, to kill each other. Don Gome then  suddenly drew his dagger, and with it in one hand, and his sword in the  other, blind with rage and desperation, rushed on Rodrigo, parrying with  his sword the strokes of his adversary, and doing his best at the same  time to pierce him with the dagger.    \"Back, felon, traitor, back!\" exclaimed Rodrigo, indignant at the  perfidy of the count. He, however, neither heard the words nor listened  to the voice of honour, which reprobates every cavalier who has recourse  to a vile stratagem in order to conquer his enemy; Rodrigo fell back a  step, and received on the point of his sword Don Gome, who fell, pierced  through, to the ground, uttering a cry of rage and agony.    Loud applause resounded on all sides; cavaliers and citizens rushed  towards Rodrigo to carry him in triumph to where his wounds could be  dressed, for abundant blood was streaming from them. Numerous flowers,  which had adorned the windows and balconies, fell at the feet of the  brave youth, and formed the victor's crown.          CHAPTER VIII    HOW XIMENA DEMANDED JUSTICE FROM THE KING AGAINST RODRIGO DIAZ      Some days have passed since Rodrigo avenged his father by killing Don  Gome, Count of Gormaz.    He had almost recovered from the wounds which he had received in the  combat; but there was another wound in his soul which science could not  cure. His sword had deprived of life the father of his beloved: would  she ever accept the hand of him who had wounded her parent to the death?  Could the slayer of the Count of Gormaz hope for the love of Ximena  Gome? Nothing could console Rodrigo; no hope of happiness remained to  him. An invincible sadness overshadowed him, which could not be driven  away, either by the joy of his parents when they saw the stain washed  away which had sullied their honour, or by the caresses and care which  they lavished on him; for Diego and Teresa had proceeded to Leon  immediately on learning the condition of their son, in order that they  might assist at the healing of his wounds.    One morning the king, Don Fernando, was amusing himself in the company  of his family, which he dearly loved. What more pleasing sight than that  of a powerful king, of a warrior, as skilful as he was wise and brave,  surrounded by his children and his wife, forgetting the triumphs of his  arms and the cares of state, in order to give himself up completely to  the joys of the domestic hearth, with the same simplicity and effusion  which the humblest subject exhibits? At his side was his wife, a noble  and honoured matron, all the pleasures of whose life were found where  her husband and children were. Don Fernando saw her, at the height of  her contentment and maternal pride, sharing with him the affection of  their sons and daughters, brave youths and beautiful maidens; his heart  participated in the satisfaction and pride of hers, and the happy  monarch considered as trifling the pleasures he enjoyed surrounded by  his courtiers, compared with those he tasted surrounded by his family.  There are in _The Chronicle of the Cid_ a few words which form the  greatest eulogium on Don Fernando as the head of a family. Those are:  \"He made his sons read that they might be the better instructed; he  taught them the use of arms, how to fence and combat; also to be  hunters. And his daughters he caused to pursue their studies under  due[~n]as, that they might be accustomed to, and instructed in, all that  was good.\" If history had not distinctly made known to us that Don  Fernando I. was a tender and affectionate father, as well as a faithful  lover and husband, the facts would be demonstrated to us by his having  had no illegitimate child, which was a very common thing amongst the  princes and lords of the period.    \"Father,\" said Don Sancho, who was the eldest of the princes, \"you have  spent very much time in camps, you have often exposed your life to the  swords of your enemies; live henceforth more for your family, and do not  go away from my mother and my brothers and sisters. I, although unworthy  of so great an honour, will take your place in war; if it is necessary  to fight against the infidels and the other enemies of Castile and Leon,  do not think, my father, that fear would cause me to vacillate or draw  back, for not in vain does your blood flow in my veins.\"    \"O my son!\" cried Don Fernando, feeling tears of joy coming to his eyes,  and clasping Don Sancho in his arms, \"I do not now fear death, for Leon  and Castile will have in you the best of kings! Secure of leaving behind  me such a successor, I shall care not should I lose my life in the  wars.\"    \"Not care for your life?\" exclaimed at the same time the queen and his  children.    \"How would it be with us should you die, dear father?\" said Urraca, the  eldest of the princesses. \"Grief would kill us also! Sad is the lot of  daughters who love their father very much and lose him!\"    Just then it was announced to the king that Ximena Gome requested an  audience. Don Fernando, who never refused to hear his subjects, now  felt, more than ever, the desire of consoling the afflicted, and  believing that the daughter of the late Count of Gormaz was very  unhappy, he ordered that she should be conducted before him.    \"Justice, my lord, justice!\" exclaimed Ximena, casting herself at the  feet of the king, and unable to articulate other words, for sobs were  almost choking her.    The noble maiden was completely changed, a fearful pallor covered her  emaciated face, which was wet with tears, and even the disorder of her  garments and hair showed her grief.    \"Justice, my lord, justice!\" she repeated, as if she were about to lose  her reason, and as if the idea which those words conveyed was the last  glimmering light of her mind.    The king, the queen, and the princesses endeavoured to calm the  excitement of her mind with affectionate words, and their efforts were  not unavailing, for in a short time she was able to express the feelings  which overmastered her, and the desire which had led her thither.    \"My lord, an audacious youth, the son of Diego Lainez, slew my father,  the Count of Gormaz, a few days ago, as you already know. Grief has kept  me prostrate on my bed until to-day, when I come to demand justice from  you. Grant it to me, my lord, by punishing the slayer of my father, for  if good kings represent on earth the authority of God, you, my lord,  must punish a murderer, under pain of incurring the displeasure both of  God and of men. During the fever which has been burning in my brain  since the day on which the hand of Rodrigo made me an orphan, I have  seen the spirit of my father, rising from his sepulchre and demanding  vengeance, and I promised it to him, counting on your justice. If you do  not grant it to me, my lord, cavaliers are not wanting amongst my  kinsmen who will respond to my request; I shall go through your states  of Leon and Castile, demanding the aid of all good men, and both friends  and strangers will hearken to my call, and the horrors of war will  avenge your injustice and the perfidy of De Vivar.\"    \"Calm your grief and your resentment, Ximena,\" answered the king in a  kind voice, \"for I promise to do you justice. If Rodrigo Diaz  treacherously killed your father, justice shall bring down her  inexorable sword on his head, just as if he were the humblest of my  subjects.\"    \"My lord, I trust in your promise. Ask the princesses, what they think  is the grief of a daughter who loses her father, and the anger she  should feel against the man who killed him. Those who love you as I  loved my father can well understand what I suffer, and will make you  also, my lord, understand it.\"    \"I have been informed that Rodrigo killed your father in fair and  honourable combat, and for my own part I can assure you that your father  had his sword, and also his dagger, unsheathed. That he was not attacked  unarmed is proved by the dangerous wounds which he inflicted on  Rodrigo.\"    \"Ah! dangerous wounds!\" exclaimed Ximena, her face again becoming pale,  which had coloured up with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42"],[0,"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (#13)"],[1,"decent furniture and tall  proportions of my room in the square; in vain that I recognised  the pattern of the bed-curtains and the design of the mahogany  frame; something still kept insisting that I was not where I was,    93)    that I had not wakened where I seemed to be, but in the little  room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body of  Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and, in my psychological way  began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion,  occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfortable  morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my more  wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry  Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and  size: it was large, firm, white, and comely. But the hand which I  now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London  morning, lying half shut on the bed-clothes, was lean, corded,  knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth  of hair. It was the hand of Edward Hyde.    I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was  in the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my  breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals; and  bounding from my bed, I rushed to the mirror. At the sight that  met my eyes, my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin  and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll, I had awakened  Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained? I asked myself, and  then, with another bound of terror--how was it to be remedied?  It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my drugs  were in the    94)    cabinet--a long journey down two pairs of stairs, through the  back passage, across the open court and through the anatomical  theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It might  indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,  when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And  then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon  my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and  going of my second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was  able, in clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the  house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at  such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later,  Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting down,  with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting.    Small indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this  reversal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian  finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of my  judgment; and I began to reflect more seriously than ever before  on the issues and possibilities of my double existence. That part  of me which I had the power of projecting, had lately been much  exercised and nourished; it had seemed to me of late as though  the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature, as though (when I  wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous tide of  blood; and I began to spy a danger that,    95)    if this were much prolonged, the balance of my nature might be  permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be  forfeited, and the character of Edward Hyde become irrevocably  mine. The power of the drug had not been always equally  displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed  me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to  double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the  amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole  shadow on my contentment. Now, however, and in the light of that  morning's accident, I was led to remark that whereas, in the  beginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of  Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself  to the other side. All things therefore seemed to point to this:  that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self, and  becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.    Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had  memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally  shared between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most  sensitive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and  shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was  indifferent to Jekyll, or but remembered him as the mountain  bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from  pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father's interest; Hyde    96)    had more than a son's indifference. To cast in my lot with  Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly  indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with  Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to  become, at a blow and for ever, despised and friendless. The  bargain might appear unequal; but there was still another  consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer  smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be not even  conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my circumstances  were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man;  much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted  and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with  so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part  and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it.    Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded  by friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute  farewell to the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step,  leaping impulses and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the  disguise of Hyde. I made this choice perhaps with some  unconscious reservation, for I neither gave up the house in Soho,  nor destroyed the clothes of Edward Hyde, which still lay ready  in my cabinet. For two months, however, I was true to my  determination; for two months I led a life of such    97)    severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the  compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last  to obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of  conscience began to grow into a thing of course; I began to be  tortured with throes and longings, as of Hyde struggling after  freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, I once again  compounded and swallowed the transforming draught.    I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon  his vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the  dangers that he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility;  neither had I, long as I had considered my position, made enough  allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate  readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of Edward  Hyde. Yet it was by these that I was punished. My devil had been  long caged, he came out roaring. I was conscious, even when I  took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity  to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my  soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the  civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God,  no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so  pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable  spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But  I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing  instincts    98)    by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree  of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted,  however slightly, was to fall.    Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a  transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight  from every blow; and it was not till weariness had begun to  succeed, that I was suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium,  struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror. A mist  dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from the scene  of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of  evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the  topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance  doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through the  lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on  my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet  still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of  the avenger. Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the  draught, and as he drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of  transformation had not done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll,  with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon  his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God. The veil of  self-indulgence was rent from head to foot, I saw my life as a  whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had  walked    99)    with my father's hand, and through the self-denying toils of my  professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense  of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have  screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down  the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory  swarmed against me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly  face of my iniquity stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this  remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy.  The problem of my conduct was solved. Hyde was thenceforth  impossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the  better part of my existence; and oh, how I rejoiced to think it!  with what willing humility, I embraced anew the restrictions of  natural life! with what sincere renunciation, I locked the door  by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key under  my heel!    The next day, came the news that the murder had been overlooked,  that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the  victim "]]]
