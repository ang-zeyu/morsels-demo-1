The Persians, who  commence drinking late in life, can swallow strong waters by the  tumbler.    Men, women, and children when hardly \"cremnobatic,\" have always  the pipe in mouth. The favourite article is a \"dudheen,\" a well  culotté clay, used and worn till the bowl touches the nose. The  poor are driven to a \"Kondukwe,\" a yard of plantain leaf,  hollowed with a wire, and charged at the thicker end. The \"holy  herb\" would of course grow in the country, and grow well, but it  is imported from the States without trouble, and perhaps with  less expense. Some tribes make a decent snuff of the common trade  article, but I never saw either sex chew--perhaps the most  wholesome, and certainly the most efficacious form. The smoking  of Lyámbá, called Dyámbá in the southern regions, is confined to  debauchees. M. du Chaillu asserts that this Cannabis sativa is  not found wild, and the people confirm his statement; possibly it  has extended from Hindostan to Zanzibar, and thence across the  continent. Intoxicating hemp is now grown everywhere, especially  in the Nkommi country, and little packages, neatly bound with  banana leaves, sell on the river for ten sous each. It is smoked  either in the \"Kondukwe\" or in the Ojo. The latter, literally  meaning a torch, is a polished cow-horn, closed at the thick end  with wood, and banded with metal; a wooden stem, projecting from  the upper or concave side, bears a neat \"chillam\" (bowl), either  of clay or of brown steatite brought from the upper Gaboon River.  This rude hookah is half filled with water; the dried hemp in the  bowl is covered with what Syrians call a \"Kurs,\" a bit of metal  about the size of half-a-crown, and upon it rests the fire. I at  once recognized the implement in the Brazil, where many slave-  holders simply supposed it to be a servile and African form of  tobacco-pipe. After a few puffs the eyes redden, a violent cough  is caused by the acrid fumes tickling the throat; the brain,  whirls with a pleasant swimming, like that of chloroform, and the  smoker finds himself in gloriâ. My Spanish friends at Po tried  but did not like it. I can answer for the hemp being stronger  than the Egyptian hashísh or the bhang of Hindostan; it rather  resembled the Fasúkh of Northern Africa, the Dakha and Motukwane  of the southern regions, and the wild variety called in Sind  \"Bang i Jabalí.\"    The religion of African races is ever interesting to those of a  maturer faith; it is somewhat like the study of childhood to an  old man. The Jew, the high-caste Hindú, and the Guebre, the  Christian and the Moslem have their Holy Writs, their fixed forms  of thought and worship, in fact their grooves in which belief  runs. They no longer see through a glass darkly; nothing with  them is left vague or undetermined. Continuation, resurrection,  eternity are hereditary and habitual ideas; they have become  almost inseparable and congenital parts of the mental system.  This condition renders it nearly as difficult for us to  understand the vagueness and mistiness of savage and unwritten  creeds, as to penetrate into the modus agendi of animal instinct.  And there is yet another obstacle in dealing with such people,  their intense and childish sensitiveness and secretiveness. They  are not, as some have foolishly supposed, ashamed of their tenets  or their practices, but they are unwilling to speak about them.  They fear the intentions of the cross-questioner, and they hold  themselves safest behind a crooked answer. Moreover, every  Mpongwe is his own \"pontifex maximus,\" and the want, or rather  the scarcity, of a regular priesthood must promote independence  and discrepancy of belief.    Whilst noticing the Fetishism of the Gaboon I cannot help  observing, by the way, how rapidly the civilization of the  nineteenth century is redeveloping, together with the \"Religion  of Humanity\" the old faith, not of Paganism, but of Cosmos, of  Nature; how directly it is, in fact, going back to its oldergods.  The UNKNOWABLE of our day is the Brahm, the Akarana-Zaman, the  Gaboon Anyambía, of which nothing can be predicated but an  existence utterly unintelligible to the brain of man, a something  free from the accidents of personality, of volition, of  intelligence, of design, of providence; a something which cannot  be addressed by veneration or worship; whose sole effects are  subjective, that is, upon the worshipper, not upon the  worshipped. Nothing also can be more illogical than the awe and  respect claimed by Mr. Herbert Spencer for a being of which the  very essence is that nothing can be known of it. And, as the idea  grows, the several modes and forms of the UNKNOWABLE, the Hormuzd  and Ahriman of the Dualist, those personifications of good and  evil; the Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, creation, preservation, and  destruction; the beginning, the middle, and the end of all  things; the Triad, adored by all Triadists under some  modification, as that of Osiris, Isis, and Horus, father, mother,  and son, type of the family; or Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto, the  three great elements; these outward and visible expressions lose  force and significance, making place for that Law of which they  are the rude exponents. The marvellous spread of Spiritualism,  whose god is the UNKNOWABLE, and whose prophet was Swedenborg, is  but the polished form of the Mpongwe Ibambo and Ilogo; the  beneficent phantasms have succeeded to the malevolent ghosts, the  shadowy deities of man's childhood; as the God of Love formerly  took the place of the God of Fear. The future of Spiritualism,  which may be defined as \"Hades with Progress,\" is making serious  inroads upon the coarse belief, worthy of the barbarous and the  middle ages, in an eternity of punishment, easily expressed by  everlasting fire, and in ineffable joys, which no one has ever  successfully expressed. The ghosts of our childhood have now  become bonâ fide objective beings, who rap, raise tables, display  fireworks, rain flowers, and brew tea. We explain by \"levitation\"  the riding of the witch upon the broom-stick to the Sabbath; we  can no longer refuse credence to Canidia and all her spells. And  the very vagueness of the modern faith serves to assimilate it  the more to its most ancient forms, one of which we are studying  upon the Gaboon River.    The missionary returning from Africa is often asked what is the  religion of the people? If an exact man, he will answer, \"I don't  know.\" And how can he know when the people themselves, even the  princes and priests, are ignorant of it? A missionary of twenty  years' standing in West Africa, an able and conscientious student  withal, assured me that during the early part of his career he  had given much time to collecting and collating, under  intelligent native superintendence, negro traditions and  religion. He presently found that no two men thought alike upon  any single subject: I need hardly say that he gave up in despair  a work hopeless as psychology, the mere study of the individual.    Fetishism, I believe, is held by the orthodox to be a degradation  of the pure and primitive \"Adamical dispensation,\" even as the  negro has been supposed to represent the accursed and degraded  descendants of Ham and Canaan. I cannot but look upon it as the  first dawn of a faith in things not seen. And it must be studied  by casting off all our preconceived ideas. For instance, Africans  believe, not in soul nor in spirit, but in ghost; when they  called M. du Chaillu a \"Mbwiri,\" they meant that the white man  had been bleached by the grave as Dante had been darkened by his  visit below, and consequently he was a subject of fear and awe.  They have a material, evanescent, intelligible future, not an  immaterial, incomprehensible eternity; the ghost endures only for  awhile and perishes like the memory of the little-great name.  Hence the ignoble dread in East and West Africa of a death which  leads to a shadowy world, and eventually to utter annihilation.  Seeing nought beyond the present-future, there is no hope for  them in the grave; they wail and sorrow with a burden of despair.  \"Ame-kwisha\"--he is finished--is the East African's last word  concerning kinsman and friend. \"All is done for ever,\" sing the  West Africans. Any allusion to loss of life turns their black  skins blue; \"Yes,\" they exclaim, \"it is bad to die, to leave  house and home, wife and children; no more to wear soft cloth,  nor eat meat, nor \"drink\" tobacco, and rum.\" \"Never speak of  that\" the moribund will exclaim with a shudder; such is the ever-  present horror of their dreadful and dreary times of sickness,  always aggravated by suspicions of witchcraft, the only cause  which their imperfect knowledge of physics can assign to death--  even Van Helmont asserted, \"Deus non fecit mortem.\" The peoples,  who, like those of Dahome, have a distinct future world, have  borrowed it, I cannot help thinking, from Egypt. And when an  African chief said in my presence to a Yahoo-like naval officer,  \"When so be I die, I come up for white man! When so be you die,  you come up for monkey!\" my suspicion is that he had distorted  the doctrine of some missionary. Man would hardly have a future  without a distinct priestly class whose interest it is to teach  \"another and a better,\"--or a worse.    Certain missionaries in the Gaboon River have detected evidences  of Judaism amongst the Mpongwe, which deserve notice but which  hardly require detailed refutation. 1. Circumcision, even on the  eighth day as amongst the Efik of the old Calabar River; but this  is a familiar custom borrowed from Egypt by the Semites; it is  done in a multitude of ways, which are limited only by necessity;  the resemblance of the Mpongwe rite to that of the Jews, though  remarkable, is purely accidental. 2. The division of tribes into  separate families and frequently into the number twelve; but this  again appears fortuitous;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5761"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 2 (#13)"],[1,"barque of 800 tons went up and down safely in  1859, but now square-rigged ships, which seldom pass Zungá chyá  Kampenzi, send up boats when something is to be done higher up.    Porto da Lenha dates like Abeokuta from the second decade of the  present century. In Tuckey's time the projection from the  northern bank was known as \"Tall Trees,\" a term common to several  places in the \"Oil rivers;\" no factories existed, schooners  sailed to Boma for cargo, and dropped down stream as soon as  loaded. From French Point it is distant 40,000 measured metres (=  21 statute miles and 1,615 yards); our charts show 20.50 nautical  miles (= 32,500 metres in round numbers). The river opposite the  projection narrows to a gate barely a mile and a half broad,  whilst the valley stretches some five miles, and the blue hills  inhabited by the Musulungus are clearly visible; the flood rises  four or five feet, and drinking water must be brought from up  stream. The site of the settlement is on the right or northern  bank behind the projection, a slip of morass backed by swamps and  thick growths, chiefly bombax, palm and acacia, lignum vitae, the  mammee-apple and the cork-tree, palmyra, pandanus, and groves of  papyrus. Low and deeply flooded during the rains, the place would  be fatal without the sea-breeze; as it is, the air is exceedingly  unwholesome. There is no quay, the canoe must act gondola; the  wharf is a mere platform with steps, and in places the filthy  drains are not dry even at this season. The length of the station  is about one mile, and of no depth except what is taken up by the  neat and expensive gardens. Eastward or up stream it thins out,  and the foundations give considerable trouble; the inhabitants  are condemned to do beavers' work, to protect the bank with  strong piles, and to heap up earth for a base, whilst, despite  all their toil, the water often finds its way in. The sixteen  houses look well; they are substantial bungalows, built country  fashion, with timber and matting; they have large and shady  verandahs, and a series of inner rooms. Each house has a well-  kept pottage plot, inferior, however, to those up stream.    The tenure of ground here, as at Borna, is by yearly rent to the  two \"kings,\" Nengongo and Nenzalo, each of whom claims a half.  Like the chiefs of Porto Novo, the despot of Dahome, the rulers  of many Nigerian tribes, and even the Fernandian \"Bube,\" these  potentates may not look at the sea nor at the river. Their power  is, therefore, deputed to \"linguisters\" or interpreters,  linguistele ya Nchinu, \"linguist to the king,\" being the official  titles of these worthies, who massacre the Portuguese language,  and who are empowered to receive \"comey\" (customs) and rent. The  revenue is composed of three principal items; an ounce ($16) per  head of negro embarked at Porto da Lenha; four per cent, on all  goods sold, and, lastly, a hundred hard dollars monthly ground-  rent--£l92 (English pound symbol) a year. The linguist becomes  more powerful than the chief, who is wholly in his power, and  always receives the best presents. Neagongo's fattore is old  Shimbah, an ignoble aspect with a \"kink in his leg;\" Mashel or  Machela, a corruption of the Portuguese Maciel, died about two  months aeo: we shall see him disembarked for burial at Boma.    It is evident that the slavers were wrong not to keep hulks like  those of the Bonny River; health would have gained, and the  procedure might have modified negro \"sass.\" The chiefs begin  early morning by going their rounds for drink, and end business  between 7 and 10 A.M. Everywhere on this coast a few hours of  work support a \"gentleman;\" even the comparatively industrious  and hard-working Egbas rarely do anything after noon. These lords  and masters are fully aware that the white men are their willing  slaves as long as the large profits last. If a glass of watered  rum, which they detect more easily than we do watered milk, be  offered to them, it will be thrown in the donor's face. Every  factory must keep a barrel of spirits ready broached if the  agents would buy eggs and yams, and the poorest negro comes  regularly with his garrafa. The mixed stuff costs per bottle only  a hundred reis (= fourpence), and thoroughly demoralizes the  black world.    We landed at once, sent our letters to M. Monteiro, who  hospitably offered his house, and passed the day quickly enough  in a round of visits. Despite the general politeness and  attention to us, we found a gloom overhanging the place: as at  Whydah, its glories have departed, nor shall they ever return.  The jollity, the recklessness, the gold ounces thrown in handfuls  upon the monte-table, are things of the past: several houses are  said to be insolvent, and the dearth of cloth is causing actual  misery. Palm and ground-nut oil enable the agents only to buy  provisions; the trade is capable of infinite expansion, but it  requires time--as yet it supports only the two non-slaving  houses, English and Dutch. The forty or fifty tons brought in  every month pay them cent, per cent.; the bag of half a hundred  weight being sold for four fathoms of cloth; or two hatchets, one  bottle of rum, and a jug or a plate.    Early next day I went to the English factory for the purpose of  completing my outfit. Unfortunately, Mr. P. Maculloch, the head  agent, who is perfectly acquainted with the river and the people,  was absent, leaving the business in the hands of two \"mean  whites,\" walking buccras, English pariahs. The factory--a dirty  disgrace to the name--was in the charge of a clerk, whom we saw  being rowed about bareheaded through the sun, accompanied by a  black girl, both as far from sober as might be. The cooper, who  was sitting moony with drink, rose to receive us and to weigh out  the beads which I required; under the excitement he had recourse  to a gin-bottle, and a total collapse came on before half the  work was done. Why should south latitude 6°, the parallel of  Zanzibar, be so fatal to the Briton?    At 2.20 P.M. on September 2, we left Porto da Lenha, and passed  Mashel's Creek, on whose right bank is the village of Makatalla;  the charts call it Foomou, and transfer it to the left. Here we  enter upon the riverine archipelago. The great stream before one,  now divides into three parallel branches, separated by long  narrow islands and islets, banks and shallows. The northernmost  channel in our maps, \"Maxwell River,\" is known to Europeans and  natives as Noangwa; Mamballa or the central line is called by the  moderns Nshibúl, and the southern is dubbed by the hydrographer,  \"Rio Konio,\" a truly terrible mistake for Sonho. As a rule, the  Noangwa, though infested during the rains by cruel mosquitoes, is  preferred for the ascent, and the central for dropping down  stream. The maximum breadth of the Congo bed, more than half  island, is here five miles; and I was forcibly reminded of it  when winding through the Dalmatian Archipelago.    The river still maintained its alluvial aspect as we passed along  the right bank. The surface was a stubble strewn with the usual  trees; the portly bombax; the calabash, now naked and of wintry  aspect; and the dark evergreen palmyra, in dots and streaks upon  the red-yellow field, fronted by an edging of grass, whose king,  cyperus papyrus, is crowned with tall heads waving like little  palms. This Egyptian bush extends from the Congo mouth to Banza  Nokki, our landing-place; it grows thickest about Porto da Lenha,  and it thins out above and below: I afterwards observed it in the  sweet water marshes of Syria and the Brazils. We passed sundry  settlements--Loango Pequeno, Loango Grande, and others--and many  canoes were seen plying up and down. On the left or to the south  was nothing but dense reedy vegetation upon the low islands,  which here are of larger dimensions than the northern line. As  evening drew near, the grasshoppers and the tree frogs chirped a  louder song, and the parrots whistled as they winged their rapid  flight high overhead. Presently we passed out of the lower  archipelago, and sighted the first high land closing upon the  stream, rolling hills, which vanished in blue perspective, and  which bore streaks of fire during the dark hours. Our Cabinda  Patron grounded us twice, and even the high night breeze hardly  enabled us to overcome the six-knot current off the narrow, whose  right side is called Ponta da Diabo. Devil's Point is not so  named in the chart: the place is marked \"Strong Tide\" (No. 1),  opposite Chombae Island, which the natives term Zungá chyá  Bundika, hence probably the name of the village Bemandika (Boma  ndika). At this satanic headland, where the banks form a gate  three miles broad, a man hailed us from the bank; none understood  him, but all made up their minds that he threatened to visit us  during the night.    A light breeze early next morning fortunately freshened as we  approached \"Strong Tide\" (No. 2). We ran north of the second  archipelago above the gate; south of us lay the \"Low Islands\" of  the chart, with plantations of beans and tobacco; the peasants  stood to stare like Icelanders, leaning on oblong-bladed paddles  six feet long, or upon alpen-stocks capped with bayonets; the  \"scare-crows\" were grass figures, with pots for heads and wooden  rattles suspended to bent poles. On the right bank a block of  hills narrows the stream, and its selvage of light green grasses  will contribute to the \"floating islands.\" Higher up, blocks and  boulders of all sizes rise from the vegetation, and prolong  themselves into the shallower waters. There are two distinct  bluffs, the westernmost marked by a tree-clump at its feet, and  between them lies a baylet, where a dozen palms denote the once  dreaded village Bemandika. The second block, 400 to 500 feet  high, bears on its rounded summit the Stone of Lightning, called  by the people Tadi Nzázhí, vulgò, Taddy Enzazzi. The Fiote"]]]
