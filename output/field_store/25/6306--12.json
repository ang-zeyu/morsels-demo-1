Suddenly the Umbrians  conceive the project of seizing Rome by surprise. The consuls are  recalled for the defence of the town. Fabius meets the Etruscans at  Mevania (on the confines of Etruria and Umbria), and, the year  following, at Allifae (447). Among the prisoners were some AEqui and  Hernici. Their towns, feeling themselves thus compromised, declared open  war against the Romans (448). The Samnites recovered courage; but the  prompt reduction of the Hernici allowed the Senate to concentrate its  forces. Two armies, penetrating into Samnium by way of Apulia and  Campania, re-established the old frontiers. Bovianum was taken for the  third time, and during six months the country was delivered up to  devastation. In vain Tarentum tried to raise new quarrels for the  Republic, and to force the Lucanians to embrace the cause of the  Samnites. The successes of the Roman arms led to the conclusion of  treaties of peace with all the peoples of Southern Italy, constrained  thenceforward to acknowledge the _majesty_ of the Roman people. The AEqui  remained alone exposed to the wrath of Rome; the Senate did not forget  that at Allifae they had fought in the ranks of the enemy, and, once  freed from its more serious embarrassments, it inflicted on this people  a terrible chastisement: forty-one places were taken and burnt in fifty  days. This period of six years thus terminated with the submission of  the Hernici and AEqui.    Five years less agitated left Rome time to regulate the position of its  new subjects, and to establish colonies and ways of communication.    The Hernici were treated in the same manner as the Latins, in 416, and  deprived of _commercium_ and _connubium_. Prefects and the law of the  Caerites were imposed on Anagnia, Frusino, and other towns guilty of  desertion. The cities which had remained faithful preserved their  independence and the title of allies (448);[199] the AEqui lost a part of  their territory and received the right of city without suffrage (450).  The Samnites, sufficiently humiliated, obtained at last the renewal of  their ancient conventions (450).[200] _Foedera non aequa_ were  concluded with the Marsi, the Peligni, the Marrucini, the Frentani  (450), the Vestini (452), and the Picentini (455).[201] Rome treated  with Tarentum on a footing of equality, and engaged not to let her fleet  pass the Lacinian Promontory to the south of the Gulf of Tarentum.[202]    Thus, on the one hand, the territories shared among the Roman citizens;  on the other, the number of the municipia were considerably augmented.  Further, the Republic had acquired new allies; she possessed at length  the passages of the Apennines and commanded both seas.[203] A girdle of  Latin fortresses protected Rome and broke the communications between the  north and south of Italy; among the Marsi and the AEqui, there were Alba  and Carseoli; Sora, towards the sources of the Liris; and Narnia, in  Umbria. Military roads connected the colonies with the metropolis.      [Sidenote: Fourth Samnite War. Second coalition of the Samnites,  Etruscans, Umbrians, and Gauls (456-464).]    VII. Peace could not last long: between Rome and the Samnites it was a  duel to death. In 456, these latter had already sufficiently recovered  from their disasters to attempt once more the fortune of arms.[204] Rome  sends to the succour of the Lucanians, suddenly attacked, two consular  armies. Vanquished at Tifernum by Fabius, at Maleventum by Decius, the  Samnites witness the devastation of their whole country. Still they do  not lose courage; their chief, Gellius Egnatius, conceives a plan which  places Rome in great danger. He divides the Samnite army into three  bodies: the first remains to defend the country; the second takes the  offensive in Campania; the third, which he commands in person, throws  itself into Etruria, and, increased by the junction of the Etruscans,  the Gauls, and the Umbrians, soon forms a numerous army.[205] The storm  roared on all sides, and, while the Roman generals were occupied some  in Samnium and others in Campania, despatches arrived from Appius,  placed at the head of the army of Etruria, announcing a terrible  coalition formed in silence by the peoples of the north, who were  concentrating all their forces in Umbria for the purpose of marching  upon Rome.    The terror was extreme, but the energy of the Romans was equal to the  danger. All able men, even to the freedmen, were enrolled, and ninety  thousand soldiers were raised. Under these grave circumstances (458),  Fabius and Decius were, once again, raised to the supreme magistracy,  and gained, under the walls of Sentinum, a brilliant victory, long  disputed. During the battle, Decius devoted himself, as his father had  done before. The coalition once dissolved, Fabius defeated another army  which had issued from Perusia, and then came to receive the honour of a  triumph in Rome. Etruria was subdued (460), and obtained a truce of  forty years.[206]    The Samnites still maintained an obstinate struggle of mingled successes  and reverses. In 461, after having taken an oath to conquer or die,  thirty thousand of them were left on the field of battle of Aquilonia. A  few months later, the celebrated Pontius, the hero of Furcae Caudinae,  re-appeared, at the end of twenty-nine years, at the head of his  fellow-citizens, and inflicted upon the son of Fabius a check, which the  latter soon retrieved with the assistance of his father.[207] Finally,  in 464, two Roman armies re-commenced, in Samnium, a war of  extermination, which led for the fourth time to the renewal of the  ancient treaties and the cession of a certain extent of territory. At  the same epoch, an insurrection which broke out in the Sabine territory  was put down by Curius Dentatus. Central Italy was conquered.    The peace with the Samnites lasted five years (464-469). Rome extended  her frontiers, and fortified those of the peoples placed under her  protectorate; and at the same time established new military forts.    The right of city without suffrage was accorded to the Sabines, and  prefects were given to some of the towns of the valley of the Vulturnus  (_Venafrum_ and _Allifae_).[208] A Latin colony, of twenty thousand men,  was sent to Venusia to watch over Southern Italy.[209] It commanded at  the same time Samnium, Apulia, and Lucania. If, owing to the treaty  concluded with the Greek towns, the Roman supremacy extended over the  south of the peninsula, to the north the Etruscans could not be reckoned  as allies, since nothing more than truces had been concluded with them.  In Umbria, the small tribe of the Sarsinates remained independent, and  all the coast district from the Rubicon to the AEsis was in the power of  the Senones; on their southern frontier the Roman colony of Sena Gallica  (_Sinigaglia_) was founded; the coast of Picenum was watched by that of  Castrum Novum and by the Latin fortress of Hatria (465).[210]      [Sidenote: Third coalition of the Etruscans, Gauls, Lucanians, and  Tarentines (469-474).]    VIII. The power of Rome had increased considerably. The Samnites, who  hitherto had played the first part, were no longer in a condition to  plan further coalitions, and one people alone could hardly be rash  enough to provoke the Republic. Yet the Lucanians, always hesitating,  gave this time the signal for a general revolt.    The attack on Thurium, by the Lucanians and Bruttians, became the  occasion of a new league, into which entered successively the  Tarentines, the Samnites, the Etruscans, and even the Gauls. The north  was soon in flames, and Etruria again became the battle-field. A Roman  army, which had hastened to relieve Arretium, was put to rout by the  Etruscans united with Gaulish mercenaries. The Senones, to whom these  belonged, having massacred the Roman ambassadors sent to expostulate on  their violation of the treaty with the Republic, the Senate sent against  them two legions who drove them back beyond the Rubicon. The Gaulish  tribe of the Boians, alarmed by the fate of the Senones, descended  immediately into Umbria, and, rallying the Etruscans, prepared to march  to renew the sack of Rome; but their march was arrested, and two  successive victories, at Lake Vadimo, (471) and Populonia (472), enabled  the Senate to conclude a convention which drove back the Boians into  their old territory. Hostilities continued with the Etruscans during two  years, after which their submission completed the conquest of Northern  Italy.      [Sidenote: Pyrrhus in Italy. Submission of Tarentum (474-488).]    IX. Free to the north, the Romans turned their efforts against the  south of Italy; war was declared against Tarentum, the people of which  had attacked a Roman flotilla. While the consul AEmilius invested the  town, the first troops of Pyrrhus, called in by the Tarentines,  disembarked in the port (474).    This epoch marks a new phase in the destinies of Rome, who is going, for  the first time, to measure herself with Greece. Hitherto the legions  have never had to combat really regular armies, but they have become  disciplined in war by incessant struggles in the mountains of Samnium  and Etruria; henceforth they will have to face old soldiers disciplined  in skilful tactics and commanded by an experienced warrior. The King of  Epirus, after having already twice lost and recovered his kingdom, and  invaded and abandoned Macedonia, dreamt of conquering the West. On the  news of his arrival at the head of twenty-five thousand soldiers and  twenty elephants,[211] the Romans enrolled all citizens capable of  bearing arms, even the proletaries; but, admirable example of courage!  they rejected the support of the Carthaginian fleet with this proud  declaration: \"The Republic only entertains wars which it can sustain  with its own forces.\"[212] While fifty thousand men, under the orders of  the consul"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],[0,"The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#13)"],[1,"Father hath is the Son's, therefore, also, the knowledge of the future.]    That the Holy Ghost is one with the Son, or Jesus, is proved also by  the fact that the Christian baptism is indiscriminately called the  _Baptism of the Holy Ghost, the Baptism in or with the Holy Ghost and  the Baptism of or in Jesus_: \"He [Christ] shall baptize _in the Holy  Ghost and fire_\" (that is the Holy Ghost acting as purifying fire)  (Matthew 3:11); \"have you received the Holy Ghost? _We have not so much  as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost_.\" He said: \"_In what then _[in  whose name then] _were you baptized_?\" Who said: \"In John's baptism *  * * Having heard these things _they were baptized in the name of the  Lord Jesus_\" (Acts 9:2, 5). \"All we who are _baptized in Christ Jesus_\"  (Romans 6:3).    B. Although the systematic doctrine of the Blessed Trinity, that is,  of three Divine Persons (not three Gods) in one God, is a gradual  development in the Church, nevertheless the distinction of the human  and divine natures in Christ is found in the writings of St. Ignatius,  disciple of the Apostle St. John, and Bishop of Antioch, who, because  of his faith, was devoured by lions by order of Trajan, A. D. 107.  Fifty and sixty years later, different Fathers, among whom Tertullian  (\"Adv. Marc\" IV. 25, and \"Adv. Wax.\" 2), Athenagoras (\"Leg\" 10: 24,  44), and Clement of Alexandria (\"Strom\" III: 12) are the most famous,  taught there are three Divine Persons in one God; that these three, the  Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, are equal to each other and are one  in substance.[A]    [Footnote A: The manifestation of the three Divine Persons at our  Lord's baptism could be interpreted as if there were three distinct  beings in God, or three Gods, if such interpretation were not precluded  by God's emphatic revelation of his Divine Unity. There was, on that  memorable occasion, a twofold divine witnessing to Christ as Son of God  come in the flesh to redeem mankind. In order to find in that event  anything in support of the \"Mormon\" tenets, there should have appeared  above the Son two glorious exalted men both pointing to him; whereas,  only a voice was heard, and a dove was seen. Nor can we argue from the  voice that the Father must have a mouth, and therefore a body; with  greater reason might we maintain that the Holy Ghost is a pigeon, as a  dove was visible; whereas, the organ of the voice was not.]    III. _Pagan Witness to the Unity of the Christian's God_.    As the Roman historian Tacitus, in his account of the Jews, wrote: \"The  Jews have no notion of any more than one Divine Being, and that known  only to the mind.\" Other pagans bore similar testimony concerning the  unity of God. In his letter to the Emperor Trajan, (A. D. 98-117) Pliny  governor of Pontus, said among other things: \"They [the Christians]  assemble on certain days before sunrise to sing hymns of praise to  Christ, their God. * * They submit to torture and death rather than  invoke the gods.\"    And Celsus, the forerunner of our modern infidels, thus slandered the  early Christians: \"Confessing that these are worthy of _their God_,  they desire to convert but fools, and vulgar and stupid and slavish  women and boys.\"    One more. Caecilius wrote: \"What monstrous notions * * * they [the  Christians] fabricate that that _God_ of theirs, whom they can neither  show nor see, should be inquiring diligently into the characters, the  acts, nay the words and secret thoughts of all men! * * * Most of you  are in want, cold, toil, hunger, and _your God_ suffers it.\"        CHAPTER III.    A REJOINDER TO REV. C. VAN DER DONCKT'S REPLY.    I have read with great interest and I trust with due care the Rev. C.  Van Der Donckt's Reply to my discourse on \"Mormon Doctrine of Deity.\"  With regard to his Reply in general, I observe three things: first,  the Reverend gentleman labors with some pains to demonstrate that  \"Mormon\" views of Deity with respect to the form and nature of God are  at variance with the Catholic and even the orthodox Protestant views on  that subject; second, the \"Mormon\" views of Deity are in conflict with  the accepted Christian philosophy; third, that \"Mormon\" doctrines stand  in sharp contrast to both Catholic and Protestant ideas respecting the  unity of God. All this is easily proved; and would have been conceded  cheerfully without proofs. \"Mormons\" not only admit the variances  but glory in them. The foregoing, however, is not the issue between  Mr. Van Der Donckt and myself. After the variances referred to are  admitted, these questions remain: Which is most in agreement with what  God has revealed concerning his form and nature, \"Mormon\" or orthodox  Christian doctrine? Which is most in harmony with sound reason and  the scriptures, \"Mormon\" doctrine, or the commonly accepted Christian  philosophy? Which in their teaching presents the true doctrine of God's  unity, \"Mormons\" or orthodox Christians? These are the issues; and so  far as the Reverend gentleman has maintained the orthodox Christian  doctrine against the \"Mormon\" doctrine, I undertake to controvert his  arguments.    I.    THE FORM OF GOD.    Following the order of my treatise, the gentleman first deals with the  form of God. His first premise is that \"_God is a Spirit_,\" quoting  the words of the Savior (John 4:24;) and Paul's words, \"The Lord is  a spirit,\" (II Cor. 3:17.) He then argues that a spirit is different  from a man, and quotes the remark of Jesus to his disciples, when he  appeared to them after his resurrection: \"A spirit hath not flesh and  bones as ye see me have\" (Luke 24:37-39). Also the words of Jesus to  Peter, \"Flesh and blood hath not revealed it [that is, that Jesus  is the Christ] unto thee, but my _Father_ who is in heaven.\" (Matt.  16:17.) The gentleman in all this sees a striking contrast between  _men, flesh and blood,_ and the _Father_; which \"conveys the sense that  God hath not flesh and blood like man, but is a spirit.\"    That God is a spirit Mr. V. holds is proved also from his being called  \"invisible\" in the Bible; and from this premise argues: \"All material  beings are visible. Absolutely invisible beings are immaterial, or  bodiless:\" and therefore, to help the gentleman out a little, not like  man in form.    With reference to the passage--\"Flesh and blood hath not revealed  it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven,\" and the Reverend  gentleman's remarks thereon, I wish to say, in passing, that the  antithesis between man and God in the passage extends merely to the  fact that the source of Peter's revelation was God, not man; and is  no attempt at defining a difference between the nature of God and the  nature of man. Here also I may say that the Latter-day Saints do not  hold that God is a personage of _flesh_ and _blood_, but a personage  of _flesh and bone_, inhabited by a spirit, just as Jesus was after  his resurrection. Joseph Smith taught concerning the resurrection that  \"all [men] will be raised by the power of God, having _spirit_ in  their bodies, and not _blood_.\"[A] Again, in speaking of the general  assembly and church of the first born in heaven (Heb. 12:23), he said:  \"Flesh and blood cannot go there; but flesh and bones, quickened by  the Spirit of God, can.\"[B] So that it must be remembered throughout  this discussion that the Latter-day Saints do not believe that God is  a personage of flesh and blood; but a personage of flesh and bone and  spirit, united.    [Footnote A: Discourse delivered at Nauvoo, March 20, 1842. _Mill.  Star_, Vol. xix, p. 213.]    [Footnote B: Discourse delivered at Nauvoo, Oct. 9, 1843. _Mill. Star_,  Vol. xxii, p. 231.]    I would remind the reader, also, that while Jesus said, \"God is a  spirit,\" and that a spirit \"hath nor flesh and bone as ye see me have,\"  he nowhere says that a spirit is immaterial or not substance. That is  a conclusion drawn by the theologians from the false philosophy of the  ancient pagans.    But let us examine these premises and arguments of Mr. Van Der Donckt,  more in detail. The inspired apostle says: \"_Our God is a consuming  fire_\" (Heb. 12:29). \"Now,\" to use the words of Mr. V., \"although we  must believe whatever God reveals to us upon one single word of his,  just as firmly as upon a thousand; nevertheless, I will add\" that  Moses, who solemnly received the word from God which he delivered  unto Israel, also says, \"_The Lord thy God is a consuming fire_\"  (Exod. 4:24). Is Mr. V. ready to believe on these solemn assertions of  scripture--hence of the Lord--that God is a fire, and therefore that  fire is God? Or would he insist upon interpreting these passages by  others, and by reason? Would he not want to quote Moses again where  he says, \"Thy God is * * * _as_ a consuming fire\" (Ex. 9:3), and  accept this as a reasonable interpretation of the passage stating so  definitely that \"God is a fire\"?    Again, \"God is light\" (I John 1:5). Would Mr. V. from that definition  of God believe and teach that God is light, mere cosmic light? Or  would he find an interpretation, or explanation necessary? And still  again, \"God is love\" (I John 4:7, 16). Love is an attribute of mind,  of spirit; must one conclude then from this definition that God is a  mere attribute of mind? These reflections will demonstrate that these  definitions of God, so far as they are such, together with the one with  which Mr. V. commences his argument, \"God is a Spirit,\" need defining.  He endeavors to anticipate the \"Mormon\" answer to this argument by  saying:          I am well aware that the Latter-day Saints interpret those texts      as meaning a spirit clothed with a body, but what nearly the whole      of mankind, Christians, Jews, and Mohammedans, have believed for      ages, cannot be upset by the gratuitous assertions of a religious      innovator of this last century.    At this point I will not appeal to or quote the \"gratuitous assertions  of a religious innovator of "]]]
