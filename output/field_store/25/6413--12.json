As the pirates swooped closer toward the ground, thern soldiery poured  from the temples into the gardens and courts.  The sight of them in the  open brought a score of fliers darting toward us from all directions.    The therns fired upon them through shields affixed to their rifles, but  on, steadily on, came the grim, black craft.  They were small fliers  for the most part, built for two to three men.  A few larger ones there  were, but these kept high aloft dropping bombs upon the temples from  their keel batteries.    At length, with a concerted rush, evidently in response to a signal of  command, the pirates in our immediate vicinity dashed recklessly to the  ground in the very midst of the thern soldiery.    Scarcely waiting for their craft to touch, the creatures manning them  leaped among the therns with the fury of demons.  Such fighting!  Never  had I witnessed its like before.  I had thought the green Martians the  most ferocious warriors in the universe, but the awful abandon with  which the black pirates threw themselves upon their foes transcended  everything I ever before had seen.    Beneath the brilliant light of Mars' two glorious moons the whole scene  presented itself in vivid distinctness.  The golden-haired,  white-skinned therns battling with desperate courage in hand-to-hand  conflict with their ebony-skinned foemen.    Here a little knot of struggling warriors trampled a bed of gorgeous  pimalia; there the curved sword of a black man found the heart of a  thern and left its dead foeman at the foot of a wondrous statue carved  from a living ruby; yonder a dozen therns pressed a single pirate back  upon a bench of emerald, upon whose iridescent surface a strangely  beautiful Barsoomian design was traced out in inlaid diamonds.    A little to one side stood Thuvia, the Thark, and I.  The tide of  battle had not reached us, but the fighters from time to time swung  close enough that we might distinctly note them.    The black pirates interested me immensely.  I had heard vague rumours,  little more than legends they were, during my former life on Mars; but  never had I seen them, nor talked with one who had.    They were popularly supposed to inhabit the lesser moon, from which  they descended upon Barsoom at long intervals.  Where they visited they  wrought the most horrible atrocities, and when they left carried away  with them firearms and ammunition, and young girls as prisoners.  These  latter, the rumour had it, they sacrificed to some terrible god in an  orgy which ended in the eating of their victims.    I had an excellent opportunity to examine them, as the strife  occasionally brought now one and now another close to where I stood.  They were large men, possibly six feet and over in height.  Their  features were clear cut and handsome in the extreme; their eyes were  well set and large, though a slight narrowness lent them a crafty  appearance; the iris, as well as I could determine by moonlight, was of  extreme blackness, while the eyeball itself was quite white and clear.  The physical structure of their bodies seemed identical with those of  the therns, the red men, and my own.  Only in the colour of their skin  did they differ materially from us; that is of the appearance of  polished ebony, and odd as it may seem for a Southerner to say it, adds  to rather than detracts from their marvellous beauty.    But if their bodies are divine, their hearts, apparently, are quite the  reverse.  Never did I witness such a malign lust for blood as these  demons of the outer air evinced in their mad battle with the therns.    All about us in the garden lay their sinister craft, which the therns  for some reason, then unaccountable to me, made no effort to injure.  Now and again a black warrior would rush from a nearby temple bearing  a young woman in his arms.  Straight for his flier he would leap while  those of his comrades who fought near by would rush to cover his escape.    The therns on their side would hasten to rescue the girl, and in an  instant the two would be swallowed in the vortex of a maelstrom of  yelling devils, hacking and hewing at one another, like fiends  incarnate.    But always, it seemed, were the black pirates of Barsoom victorious,  and the girl, brought miraculously unharmed through the conflict, borne  away into the outer darkness upon the deck of a swift flier.    Fighting similar to that which surrounded us could be heard in both  directions as far as sound carried, and Thuvia told me that the attacks  of the black pirates were usually made simultaneously along the entire  ribbon-like domain of the therns, which circles the Valley Dor on the  outer slopes of the Mountains of Otz.    As the fighting receded from our position for a moment, Thuvia turned  toward me with a question.    \"Do you understand now, O Prince,\" she said, \"why a million warriors  guard the domains of the Holy Therns by day and by night?\"    \"The scene you are witnessing now is but a repetition of what I have  seen enacted a score of times during the fifteen years I have been a  prisoner here.  From time immemorial the black pirates of Barsoom have  preyed upon the Holy Therns.    \"Yet they never carry their expeditions to a point, as one might  readily believe it was in their power to do, where the extermination of  the race of therns is threatened.  It is as though they but utilized  the race as playthings, with which they satisfy their ferocious lust  for fighting; and from whom they collect toll in arms and ammunition  and in prisoners.\"    \"Why don't they jump in and destroy these fliers?\" I asked.  \"That  would soon put a stop to the attacks, or at least the blacks would  scarce be so bold.  Why, see how perfectly unguarded they leave their  craft, as though they were lying safe in their own hangars at home.\"    \"The therns do not dare.  They tried it once, ages ago, but the next  night and for a whole moon thereafter a thousand great black  battleships circled the Mountains of Otz, pouring tons of projectiles  upon the temples, the gardens, and the courts, until every thern who  was not killed was driven for safety into the subterranean galleries.    \"The therns know that they live at all only by the sufferance of the  black men.  They were near to extermination that once and they will not  venture risking it again.\"    As she ceased talking a new element was instilled into the conflict.  It came from a source equally unlooked for by either thern or pirate.  The great banths which we had liberated in the garden had evidently  been awed at first by the sound of the battle, the yelling of the  warriors and the loud report of rifle and bomb.    But now they must have become angered by the continuous noise and  excited by the smell of new blood, for all of a sudden a great form  shot from a clump of low shrubbery into the midst of a struggling mass  of humanity.  A horrid scream of bestial rage broke from the banth as  he felt warm flesh beneath his powerful talons.    As though his cry was but a signal to the others, the entire great pack  hurled themselves among the fighters.  Panic reigned in an instant.  Thern and black man turned alike against the common enemy, for the  banths showed no partiality toward either.    The awful beasts bore down a hundred men by the mere weight of their  great bodies as they hurled themselves into the thick of the fight.  Leaping and clawing, they mowed down the warriors with their powerful  paws, turning for an instant to rend their victims with frightful fangs.    The scene was fascinating in its terribleness, but suddenly it came to  me that we were wasting valuable time watching this conflict, which in  itself might prove a means of our escape.    The therns were so engaged with their terrible assailants that now, if  ever, escape should be comparatively easy.  I turned to search for an  opening through the contending hordes.  If we could but reach the  ramparts we might find that the pirates somewhere had thinned the  guarding forces and left a way open to us to the world without.    As my eyes wandered about the garden, the sight of the hundreds of air  craft lying unguarded around us suggested the simplest avenue to  freedom.  Why it had not occurred to me before!  I was thoroughly  familiar with the mechanism of every known make of flier on Barsoom.  For nine years I had sailed and fought with the navy of Helium.  I had  raced through space on the tiny one-man air scout and I had commanded  the greatest battleship that ever had floated in the thin air of dying  Mars.    To think, with me, is to act.  Grasping Thuvia by the arm, I whispered  to Tars Tarkas to follow me.  Quickly we glided toward a small flier  which lay furthest from the battling warriors.  Another instant found  us huddled on the tiny deck.  My hand was on the starting lever.  I  pressed my thumb upon the button which controls the ray of repulsion,  that splendid discovery of the Martians which permits them to navigate  the thin atmosphere of their planet in huge ships that dwarf the  dreadnoughts of our earthly navies into pitiful insignificance.    The craft swayed slightly but she did not move.  Then a new cry of  warning broke upon our ears.  Turning, I saw a dozen black pirates  dashing toward us from the melee.  We had been discovered.  With  shrieks of rage the demons sprang for us.  With frenzied insistence I  continued to press the little button which should have sent us racing  out into space, but still the vessel refused to budge.  Then it came to  me--the reason that she would not rise.    We had stumbled upon a two-man flier.  Its ray tanks were charged only  with sufficient repulsive energy to lift two ordinary men.  The Thark's  great weight was anchoring us to our doom.    The blacks were nearly upon us.  There was not an instant to be lost in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#13)"],[1,"on along the  coast of Mozambique, and the desolate shores of Africa to the north,  till we came to the Red Sea, all we could hope for there was to be taken  by the Arabs, and be sold for slaves to the Turks, which to all of us  was little better than death. We could not build anything of a vessel  that would carry us over the great Arabian Sea to India, nor could we  reach the Cape de Bona Speranza, the winds being too variable, and the  sea in that latitude too tempestuous; but we all knew, if we could cross  this continent of land, we might reach some of the great rivers that run  into the Atlantic Ocean; and that, on the banks of any of those rivers,  we might there build us canoes which would carry us down, if it were  thousands of miles, so that we could want nothing but food, of which we  were assured we might kill sufficient with our guns; and to add to the  satisfaction of our deliverance, we concluded we might, every one of  us, get a quantity of gold, which, if we came safe, would infinitely  recompense us for our toil.    I cannot say that in all our consultations I ever began to enter into  the weight and merit of any enterprise we went upon till now. My view  before was, as I thought, very good, viz., that we should get into the  Arabian Gulf, or the mouth of the Red Sea; and waiting for some vessel  passing or repassing there, of which there is plenty, have seized upon  the first we came at by force, and not only have enriched ourselves with  her cargo, but have carried ourselves to what part of the world we had  pleased; but when they came to talk to me of a march of 2000 or 3000  miles on foot, of wandering in deserts among lions and tigers, I confess  my blood ran chill, and I used all the arguments I could to persuade  them against it.    But they were all positive, and I might as well have held my tongue; so  I submitted, and told them I would keep to our first law, to be governed  by the majority, and we resolved upon our journey. The first thing we  did was to take an observation, and see whereabouts in the world we  were, which we did, and found we were in the latitude of 12 degrees 35  minutes south of the line. The next thing was to look on the charts, and  see the coast of the country we aimed at, which we found to be from 8 to  11 degrees south latitude, if we went for the coast of Angola, or in 12  to 29 degrees north latitude, if we made for the river Niger, and the  coast of Guinea.    Our aim was for the coast of Angola, which, by the charts we had, lying  very near the same latitude we were then in, our course thither was due  west; and as we were assured we should meet with rivers, we doubted not  but that by their help we might ease our journey, especially if we could  find means to cross the great lake, or inland sea, which the natives  call Coalmucoa, out of which it is said the river Nile has its source  or beginning; but we reckoned without our host, as you will see in the  sequel of our story.    The next thing we had to consider was, how to carry our baggage, which  we were first of all determined not to travel without; neither indeed  was it possible for us to do so, for even our ammunition, which was  absolutely necessary to us, and on which our subsistence, I mean for  food, as well as our safety, and particularly our defence against wild  beasts and wild men, depended,--I say, even our ammunition was a load  too heavy for us to carry in a country where the heat was such that we  should be load enough for ourselves.    We inquired in the country, and found there was no beast of burthen  known among them, that is to say, neither horses or mules, or asses,  camels, or dromedaries; the only creature they had was a kind of  buffalo, or tame bull, such a one as we had killed; and that some of  these they had brought so to their hand, that they taught them to go and  come with their voices, as they called them to them, or sent them from  them; that they made them carry burthens; and particularly that they  would swim over rivers and lakes upon them, the creatures swimming very  high and strong in the water.    But we understood nothing of the management of guiding such a  creature, or how to bind a burthen upon them; and this last part of our  consultation puzzled us extremely. At last I proposed a method for them,  which, after some consideration, they found very convenient; and this  was, to quarrel with some of the negro natives, take ten or twelve of  them prisoners, and binding them as slaves, cause them to travel with  us, and make them carry our baggage; which I alleged would be convenient  and useful many ways as well to show us the way, as to converse with  other natives for us.    This counsel was not accepted at first, but the natives soon gave them  reason to approve it, and also gave them an opportunity to put it in  practice; for, as our little traffic with the natives was hitherto upon  the faith of their first kindness, we found some knavery among them at  last; for having bought some cattle of them for our toys, which, as  I said, our cutler had contrived, one of our men differing with his  chapman, truly they huffed him in their manner, and, keeping the things  he had offered them for the cattle, made their fellows drive away the  cattle before his face, and laugh at him. Our man crying out loud of  this violence, and calling to some of us who were not far off, the negro  he was dealing with threw a lance at him, which came so true, that, if  he had not with great agility jumped aside, and held up his hand also  to turn the lance as it came, it had struck through his body; and, as it  was, it wounded him in the arm; at which the man, enraged, took up his  fuzee, and shot the negro through the heart.    The others that were near him, and all those that were with us at  a distance, were so terribly frighted, first, at the flash of fire;  secondly, at the noise; and thirdly, at seeing their countryman killed,  that they stood like men stupid and amazed, at first, for some time; but  after they were a little recovered from their fright, one of them, at a  good distance from us, set up a sudden screaming noise, which, it  seems, is the noise they make when they go to fight; and all the rest  understanding what he meant, answered him, and ran together to the place  where he was, and we not knowing what it meant, stood still, looking  upon one another like a parcel of fools.    But we were presently undeceived; for, in two or three minutes more,  we heard the screaming roaring noise go on from one place to another,  through all their little towns; nay, even over the creek to the other  side; and, on a sudden, we saw a naked multitude running from all parts  to the place where the first man began it, as to a rendezvous; and, in  less than an hour, I believe there was near 500 of them gotten together,  armed some with bows and arrows, but most with lances, which they throw  at a good distance, so nicely that they will strike a bird flying.    We had but a very little time for consultation, for the multitude was  increasing every moment; and I verily believe, if we had stayed long,  they would have been 10,000 together in a little time. We had nothing  to do, therefore, but to fly to our ship or bark, where indeed we could  have defended ourselves very well, or to advance and try what a volley  or two of small shot would do for us.    We resolved immediately upon the latter, depending upon it that the fire  and terror of our shot would soon put them to flight; so we drew up all  in a line, and marched boldly up to them. They stood ready to meet us,  depending, I suppose, to destroy us all with their lances; but before  we came near enough for them to throw their lances, we halted, and,  standing at a good distance from one another, to stretch our line as far  as we could, we gave them a salute with our shot, which, besides what we  wounded that we knew not of, knocked sixteen of them down upon the spot,  and three more were so lamed, that they fell about twenty or thirty  yards from them.    As soon as we had fired, they set up the horridest yell, or howling,  partly raised by those that were wounded, and partly by those that  pitied and condoled the bodies they saw lie dead, that I never heard  anything like it before or since.    We stood stock still after we had fired, to load our guns again, and  finding they did not stir from the place we fired among them again; we  killed about nine of them at the second fire; but as they did not stand  so thick as before, all our men did not fire, seven of us being ordered  to reserve our charge, and to advance as soon as the other had fired,  while the rest loaded again; of which I shall speak again presently.    As soon as we had fired the second volley, we shouted as loud as we  could, and the seven men advanced upon them, and, coming about twenty  yards nearer, fired again, and those that were behind having loaded  again with all expedition, followed; but when they saw us advance, they  ran screaming away as if they were bewitched.    When we came up to the field of battle, we saw a great number of bodies  lying upon the ground, many more than we could suppose were killed or  wounded; nay, more than we had bullets in our pieces when we fired; and  we could not tell what to make of it; but at length we found how it  was, viz., that they were frighted out of all manner of sense; nay, I do  believe several of those that were really dead, were frighted to death,  and had no wound about them.    Of those that were thus frighted, as I have said, several of them, as  they recovered themselves, came and worshipped us (taking us for gods or  devils, I know not which, nor did it much matter to us): some kneeling,  some throwing themselves flat on the ground, made a thousand antic  gestures, but all with tokens of the most profound submission. It  presently came into my head, that we might now, by the law of arms, take  as"]]]
