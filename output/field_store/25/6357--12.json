A glass window from the cabin gives a view of the  interior of the bag and as Trotter looked he saw light blinking from 14  bullet holes--through which gas had been pouring for three days!    The nearest hangar where repairs could be made and helium secured was at  Scott Field, near St. Louis, 400 miles away. By this time the ship had  barely enough lift for the pilot and 100 gallons of gas, not enough for  the co-pilot. So Trotter flew alone to St. Louis, landing so heavy that  the ship had almost to be carried into the hangar, made his repairs and  was back in Oklahoma the next day.    Sewell had the experience of seeing a propeller fly off while heading  down the bay from San Francisco, saw it careen wildly down, flew on to  the next airport on one motor, mounted his spare.    Always the pilots were calling for more speed, removing or streamlining  whatever sources of resistance they could, picking the time for  cross-country flights when conditions were favorable. They flew from  Akron to Washington and New York frequently at 60 miles per hour. The  Reliance did even better in a trip north in 1939.    Starting home after its winter in Florida, the ship was held up in  Jacksonville--by tire trouble of all things. The distance an airship can  make in a day is limited by the distance the bus can travel, since the  ground crew must be on hand at night to land the ship. And by now the  bus, with its radio equipment, masts and the like had reached the point  where only the special Goodyear YKL tires would sustain the 14,000  pounds of weight comfortably. There was a shortage of YKL's when they  started and three standard tires had failed on the run up from Miami.  Neither Jacksonville nor Atlanta branch had YKL's in that size and to  get them from Akron would entail a day's delay.    Meanwhile the ship was tugging on the mast, with a strong south wind,  anxious to get under way. The pilots held a conference. Maybe, utilizing  the tail wind, they could make it non-stop all the way to Washington,  700 miles north and have Lange's crew land them. If they ran short of  gas they could stop at Ft. Bragg, N. C., a convenient half-way point.  The Army had a motorized observation balloon there, and was always  willing to lend a hand to fellow airshippers. It was Sheppard's turn to  take the controls. He sent a wire to Ft. Bragg.    \"If I run short of fuel, I'll circle the field as a signal. Could you  land my ship, lend me enough gas to get on to Washington?\" The answer  came back promptly, in the affirmative, and the ship left at midnight.    Roaring across the Carolinas at mile a minute speed the Reliance sighted  Ft. Bragg before daylight, with plenty of gas left. An entire company  was lined up ready to land the ship. Sheppard flew low, cut his motors,  thanked them, flew on for Hoover Airport, arriving before noon. He  averaged 66 miles per hour over the 700 mile trip, and landed with  enough gasoline to have gone on to New York.    By utilizing helping winds, throttling his motors to cruising speed,  Sheppard had effected most economical use of his fuel supply.    Fickes used the same technique more strikingly in the delivery flight of  the larger Navy K-5 in 1941, when he flew in to Lakehurst from Wingfoot  Lake at 100 miles per hour speed, again demonstrating that greater  cruising radius than that for which a ship was designed may be effected,  whenever it is possible to pick departure times that are most favorable.        [Illustration: Ships like these, off New York City's great harbor,      might afford warning of the approach of enemy submarines, or the      laying of mines to endanger its shipping.]        [Illustration: Operating from a base across in Jersey, the blimps      became a familiar sight around New York City during the World's      Fair.]        [Illustration: While throughout the middle west, the long afternoon      shadows marked the arrival in one city after another of strange      visitors from the sky.]    Other improvements in construction or operating technique grew out of  the fleet's experiences in flying in all weathers. A trip made by the  Defender in 1930 from Miami across to Havana brought home the usefulness  of the radio. The insurance underwriters insisted on a two-way radio  being installed, along with pontoons on the ship, as safety precautions.  Neither radio nor pontoons were needed during the crossing, but the  pilots sensed the desirability of being able to communicate with their  home station and their airport objective. Shortly after a short wave  frequency was granted to the ships, one of the early ones in aircraft,  and two-way sets were later installed on every ship, on the ground-crew  buses and at Akron.    This permitted the making of daily weather maps, extended the airships'  radius of action. Pilots would set out with more assurance, knowing that  they would be quickly advised of foul weather ahead, could change their  course, give appropriate instructions to the men on the ground, land  whenever it seemed desirable.    In the end the airships were all doing instrument flying, riding the  radio beams like the passenger airplanes, got their landing and take-off  instructions from the radio control towers at the airports.    The fleet proved an ideal testing vehicle for the expeditionary mast.  But progress moved carefully, a step at a time. As late as 1930 an air  dock was built alongside the company's plant at Gadsden, Ala., for use  as an operating base in the middle south. It was thought necessary as a  half way point for ships headed for Florida. After the high mast came in  however, the Gadsden dock came to be used only for warehousing, and no  airship has been inside it in four years.    In 1932 the Volunteer started in from Los Angeles for Akron, making the  first successful trip of any non-rigid airship over the Continental  Divide. The Volunteer was due for helium purification and a new bag. No  helium facilities were available closer than Akron. Rather than deflate  the ship and send it by train, Pilot Smith decided to fly in. He laid  out a route via El Paso, San Antonio, and Scott Field, so that he could  get shelter, if necessary, at army hangars at those points. He berthed  at El Paso just after a 100-mile-an-hour storm had passed over, stayed  three days at Kelly Field, found it unnecessary to stop over night at  Scott. Even so, because of persistent head winds he had had to spend ten  nights in the open, setting up his low mast with screw stakes on the  open prairie.    Mooring out procedure had improved by the time that Sewell made the same  trip five years later, so he made only courtesy stops at the three army  camps, was on his own.    A mishap at Louisville gave impetus to the development of the high mast.  The retractible low mast mounted on top of the bus was attached to the  bag about half way between the car and nose of the ship, convenient to  get at, the system being referred to as \"belly-mooring.\" The low mast  was light, could be set up quickly and easily, would hold securely  against a straight pull of considerable force. However, it was not as  effective in the case of a wind shift, or gusts which rolled the ship on  its side. A higher mast, with the ship anchored at the nose, was free to  swing in all directions. Every one realized this, but it was only after  Crum's ship was caught and twisted by a gust at Louisville, punching a  hole in the bag, that the change was made.    The high mast, built in sections, anchored by guy wires to stakes  screwed in the ground, was more bulky, took longer to set up, but would  hold the ship indefinitely once it was in place.    Thereafter both masts were carried in cross-country trips, the  convenient low mast being used for overnight stops in good weather, the  high mast for more extended operations, or when the weather looked  threatening.    The ground-crew bus was in evolution during this period. Built  originally to carry merely crew, spare parts and supplies it added a  radio room, navigation quarters, and carried the two masts. A scout car  cruises ahead to make overnight arrangements, a trailer follows, with  its own electric plant and expeditionary equipment, including a spot  light to play on the ship at night. Duties of airship personnel grew  more specialized and complex.    Members of the ground crew acted as radio technicians, meteorologists,  mechanics, riggers. They comprised a colorful group, recruited from all  parts of the country. Sailors from New Bedford, fruit growers from  Florida, farm boys from Ohio, ranchers from the San Joaquin valley, a  mechanic from a Chicago airport, a policeman from the Cleveland fair,  all dropped their work and followed the airships. The personnel list was  a history of every place an airship had operated.    The work wasn't easy, involved long hours in the cold and rain when  storms threatened, picking up mail from their families on the fly in  cross-country operations, moving their households from north to south  and north again. But the ground-crew men stuck, most of them having ten  years' service and more. On cross-country trips a crew of 14, including  pilots, is adequate.    The pilot personnel too formed an interesting group. Jack Boettner,  chief pilot, veteran of the group, with probably more airship hours than  any man in the world, certainly in non-rigid airships, had played  all-American football at Washington and Jefferson, been instructor at  Wingfoot Lake through the first war, was working in Goodyear's  aeronautical sales when the fleet got under way.    As expansion started in 1927 Smith came in from the aero workshop, would  remain second in flight hours only to Boettner.

At our approach fled in terror flocks  of green pigeons, jays, ibis, turtledoves, golden pheasants, quails and  moorhens, with crows and hawks, while now and then a solitary pelican  winged its way to the distance.    Nor was this enlivening prospect without its pairs of antelope, and  monkeys which hopped away like Australian kangaroos; these latter were  of good size, with round bullet heads, white breasts, and long tails  tufted at the end.    We arrived at Kikoka by 5 P.M., having loaded and unloaded our pack  animals four times, crossing one deep puddle, a mud sluice, and a river,  and performed a journey of eleven miles.    The settlement of Kikoka is a collection of straw huts; not built after  any architectural style, but after a bastard form, invented by indolent  settlers from the Mrima and Zanzibar for the purpose of excluding as  much sunshine as possible from the eaves and interior. A sluice and some  wells provide them with water, which though sweet is not particularly  wholesome or appetizing, owing to the large quantities of decayed matter  which is washed into it by the rains, and is then left to corrupt in it.  A weak effort has been made to clear the neighbourhood for providing  a place for cultivation, but to the dire task of wood-chopping and  jungle-clearing the settlers prefer occupying an open glade, which they  clear of grass, so as to be able to hoe up two or three inches of soil,  into which they cast their seed, confident of return.    The next day was a halt at Kikoka; the fourth caravan, consisting solely  of Wanyamwezi, proving a sore obstacle to a rapid advance. Maganga, its  chief, devised several methods of extorting more cloth and presents from  me, he having cost already more than any three chiefs together; but his  efforts were of no avail further than obtaining promises of reward if he  would hurry on to Unyanyembe so that I might find my road clear.    On the 2(7?)th, the Wanyamwezi having started, we broke camp soon after  at 7 am. The country was of the same nature as that lying between  the Kingani and Kikokaa park land, attractive and beautiful in every  feature.    I rode in advance to secure meat should a chance present itself, but  not the shadow of vert or venison did I see. Ever in our  front--westerly--rolled the land-waves, now rising, now subsiding,  parallel one with the other, like a ploughed field many times magnified.  Each ridge had its knot of jungle or its thin combing of heavily  foliaged trees, until we arrived close to Rosako, our next halting  place, when the monotonous wavure of the land underwent a change,  breaking into independent hummocks clad with dense jungle. On one of  these, veiled by an impenetrable jungle of thorny acacia, rested Rosako;  girt round by its natural fortification, neighbouring another village  to the north of it similarly protected. Between them sank a valley  extremely fertile and bountiful in its productions, bisected by a small  stream, which serves as a drain to the valley or low hills surrounding  it.    Rosako is the frontier village of Ukwere, while Kikoka is the  north-western extremity of Uzaramo. We entered this village, and  occupied its central portion with our tents and animals. A kitanda,  or square light bedstead, without valance, fringe, or any superfluity  whatever, but nevertheless quite as comfortable as with them, was  brought to my tent for my use by the village chief. The animals were,  immediately after being unloaded, driven out to feed, and the soldiers  to a man set to work to pile the baggage up, lest the rain, which during  the Masika season always appears imminent, might cause irreparable  damage.    Among other experiments which I was about to try in Africa was that of  a good watch-dog on any unmannerly people who would insist upon coming  into my tent at untimely hours and endangering valuables. Especially did  I wish to try the effect of its bark on the mighty Wagogo, who, I was  told by certain Arabs, would lift the door of the tent and enter whether  you wished them or not; who would chuckle at the fear they inspired, and  say to you, \"Hi, hi, white man, I never saw the like of you before; are  there many more like you? where do you come from?\" Also would they take  hold of your watch and ask you with a cheerful curiosity, \"What is this  for, white man?\" to which you of course would reply that it was to tell  you the hour and minute. But the Mgogo, proud of his prowess, and more  unmannerly than a brute, would answer you with a snort of insult. I  thought of a watch-dog, and procured a good one at Bombay not only as a  faithful companion, but to threaten the heels of just such gentry.    But soon after our arrival at Rosako it was found that the dog, whose  name was \"Omar,\" given him from his Turkish origin, was missing; he had  strayed away from the soldiers during a rain-squall and had got lost.  I despatched Mabruki Burton back to Kikoka to search for him. On the  following morning, just as we were about to leave Rosako, the faithful  fellow returned with the lost dog, having found him at Kikoka.    Previous to our departure on the morning after this, Maganga, chief  of the fourth caravan, brought me the unhappy report that three of his  pagazis were sick, and he would like to have some \"dowa\"--medicine.  Though not a doctor, or in any way connected with the profession, I had  a well-supplied medicine chest--without which no traveller in Africa  could live--for just such a contingency as was now present. On visiting  Maganga's sick men, I found one suffering from inflammation of the  lungs, another from the mukunguru (African intermittent). They all  imagined themselves about to die, and called loudly for \"Mama!\" \"Mama!\"  though they were all grown men. It was evident that the fourth caravan  could not stir that day, so leaving word with Magauga to hurry after me  as soon as possible, I issued orders for the march of my own.    Excepting in the neighbourhood of the villages which we have passed  there were no traces of cultivation. The country extending between the  several stations is as much a wilderness as the desert of Sahara, though  it possesses a far more pleasing aspect. Indeed, had the first man at  the time of the Creation gazed at his world and perceived it of the  beauty which belongs to this part of Africa, he would have had no cause  of complaint. In the deep thickets, set like islets amid a sea of grassy  verdure, he would have found shelter from the noonday heat, and a safe  retirement for himself and spouse during the awesome darkness. In the  morning he could have walked forth on the sloping sward, enjoyed its  freshness, and performed his ablutions in one of the many small streams  flowing at its foot. His garden of fruit-trees is all that is required;  the noble forests, deep and cool, are round about him, and in their  shade walk as many animals as one can desire. For days and days let a  man walk in any direction, north, south, east, and west, and he will  behold the same scene.    Earnestly as I wished to hurry on to Unyanyembe, still a heart-felt  anxiety about the arrival of my goods carried by the fourth caravan,  served as a drag upon me and before my caravan had marched nine miles  my anxiety had risen to the highest pitch, and caused me to order a camp  there and then. The place selected for it was near a long straggling  sluice, having an abundance of water during the rainy season, draining  as it does two extensive slopes. No sooner had we pitched our camp,  built a boma of thorny acacia, and other tree branches, by stacking them  round our camp, and driven our animals to grass; than we were made aware  of the formidable number and variety of the insect tribe, which for a  time was another source of anxiety, until a diligent examination of the  several species dispelled it.    As it was a most interesting hunt which I instituted for the several  specimens of the insects, I here append the record of it for what it is  worth. My object in obtaining these specimens was to determine whether  the genus _Glossina morsitans_ of the naturalist, or the tsetse  (sometimes called setse) of Livingstone, Vardon, and Gumming, said to  be deadly to horses, was amongst them. Up to this date I had been nearly  two months in East Africa, and had as yet seen no tsetse; and my horses,  instead of becoming emaciated--for such is one of the symptoms of a  tsetse bite--had considerably improved in condition. There were three  different species of flies which sought shelter in my tent, which,  unitedly, kept up a continual chorus of sounds--one performed the basso  profondo, another a tenor, and the third a weak contralto. The first  emanated from a voracious and fierce fly, an inch long, having a ventral  capacity for blood quite astonishing.    This larger fly was the one chosen for the first inspection, which was  of the intensest. I permitted one to alight on my flannel pyjamas, which  I wore while en deshabille in camp. No sooner had he alighted than his  posterior was raised, his head lowered, and his weapons, consisting  of four hair-like styles, unsheathed from the proboscis-like bag which  concealed them, and immediately I felt pain like that caused by a  dexterous lancet-cut or the probe of a fine needle. I permitted him to  gorge himself, though my patience and naturalistic interest were sorely  tried. I saw his abdominal parts distend with the plenitude of the  repast until it had swollen to three times its former shrunken girth,  when he flew away of his own accord laden with blood. On rolling up my  flannel pyjamas to see the fountain whence the fly had drawn the fluid,  I discovered it to be a little above the left knee, by a crimson bead  resting over the incision. After wiping the blood the wound was similar  to that caused by a deep thrust of a fine needle, but all pain had  vanished"]]]
