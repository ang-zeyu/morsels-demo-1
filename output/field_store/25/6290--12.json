The Austrian government finally concluded the matter by  arbitrarily dissolving the Italian Railways Association. The case had  however shown Manin a possible mode of attacking the foreign despotism,  finding flaws in its laws and concentrating on such weaknesses until  eventually its whole fabric was loosened. He did not believe that  any sudden local revolution could succeed, he saw only the loss of  valuable lives thereby, but he did believe that the way for some later  far-sweeping rising might be paved by consecutive breaches in the  enemy's legal walls. This opinion was the result of his evenly-balanced,  deliberate judgment; he could at times, as he was to show later, throw  himself passionately into a cause, without regard to consequences, but  his nature was not that of the ardent revolutionary; he relied on cool,  sober judgments, and was not readily led from them by illusions. In his  notes we find him writing, \"Against disorder I feel a repulsion not  only of reason but of instinct, the same as I feel against everything  contrary to the laws of harmony, a deformed face, a discordant sound.\"    His advocacy of the Italian bankers brought Manin before the Venetian  public, he was recognized as an able speaker with a deep knowledge  of law. He spoke before the Venetian Athenaeum on the obligation of  thinkers to inspire and stimulate men of action. The subject gave him  a chance to draw attention to the present lethargy of Venice and to  urge consideration of new ideas affecting trade and commerce. He hoped  to unite northern Italians through the new principle of free trade.  Fortunately Cobden, the great English advocate of free trade, was  traveling in Italy; he visited Venice and met Manin and some of the  other Venetian leaders of opinion just as he had met Cavour at Turin  and Massimo d'Azeglio at Genoa.    Various small events gave the lawyer a chance to speak publicly to his  fellow-citizens. At the Scientific Congress which met in September,  1847, he was appointed a commissioner to investigate the charitable  institutions of Venice, and in doing this work he came upon the case  of a poor infirm workman who had placed a placard upon a public wall  complaining that the government had left him to starve, and for which  action had been placed in a lunatic asylum. Manin reported the case  and wrote, \"The physicians acknowledge the man is sane; but they dare  not set him at liberty, fearing it would be contrary to the views of  the police and government. For my part, I have a better opinion of the  government and the police. I do not admit that they create madmen by  decrees. If Padovini is culpable there are the laws.\" Count Palffy,  the Governor, was very much vexed. \"We must release Padovini from the  madhouse,\" he said, \"and put Manin in his place.\"    About the same time Count Jablonski, a relation of the Venetian  Governor, wrote a paper urging the Italians to become resigned. In reply  Manin set down his thoughts in a page which seems to sum up his whole  purpose, a wonderful expression of his philosophy. It was not published  at that time, but was later found among his papers. It read:    \"It is the fashion to preach resignation.    \"I distinguish two kinds of resignation; the one virtuous and manly; the  other cowardly, and worthy only of fools.    \"The strong man, when overcome by misfortune, seeks the means of  remedying it. Does he find any? In spite of difficulties, he applies  himself to the task, excited, cheerful, and vigorous, full of energy and  pertinacity. It is only when he is certain that no remedy exists, that  he becomes resigned. This is manly resignation.    \"The coward, when misfortune overtakes him, allows himself to be cast  down, and seeks no means of remedying it. However spontaneous and easy  relief may present itself to his mind, he attempts nothing, he wishes  neither to trouble nor expose himself--he is resigned: this is the  resignation of the fool.    \"Therefore, resignation is virtuous and manly under evils manifestly  without remedy; it is cowardly and stupid when we can in any way free  ourselves from these evils.    \"In the individual, resignation may often be virtuous; in a nation  it is perhaps never so, for the misfortunes of a nation are seldom  irremediable.    \"To overcome the misfortunes of a nation, we can employ the whole  intellectual, moral, and physical power of all its citizens; and if  the generation which commences the generous task does not succeed in  accomplishing it, other generations follow, who will attain success; for  nations never die.    \"This is the reason why those who advise resignation to nations, advise  cowardice, and the nations which become resigned are cowards.\"    Therein lies the whole wisdom of Manin's political philosophy, and also  that of many of the earlier Italian patriots. How could Austria hope to  keep such men forever in subjection?    Manin's avowed purpose was to show again and again that the Austrians  were not obeying the laws which they had themselves given to the  subject provinces. One of the methods of Austrian administrative rule  was the use of supposedly representative councils called the Central  and Provincial Congregations, which were designed to communicate the  wishes of the people of Venice and Lombardy in the form of petitions  to the Imperial council, and which had failed lamentably to use even  that meager power. On December 9, 1847, Nazari, a deputy to the Lombard  Congregation, moved that the grievances of the country be represented to  the Imperial government. Not a single Venetian deputy followed his lead,  but Manin, as a private individual, signed a petition to the Venetian  Congregation calling upon them to speak for the people. His comments  were brief but vigorous. \"The Congregations,\" he said, \"have never been  the interpreters of our wants or wishes--their silence has arisen from  a fear of displeasing the government; but this fear is unjust, and  injurious: for it is unjust and injurious to suppose that the government  has granted to this kingdom a derisory national representation, that it  deceived, and still deceives, this country and Europe, in making laws  which it does not wish to be observed, and in prosecuting and punishing  those who intend observing them.\" The Venetians were delighted with  the petition, they were beginning to feel the first thrills of a new  civic life. On December 30, Manin and Tommaseo, a brilliant poet and  public-spirited citizen, drew up another address which in bold terms  denounced the Austrian censorship of the press contrary to a specific  clause in the law of 1815. All the members of the Ateneo, the literary  club of Venice, signed the petition that went with the address.    The Austrians failed to see in the unrest that appeared throughout Italy  at the close of 1847 more than a series of local and widely-separated  disturbances, and made small effort to appease any of the leaders. For  their part in preparing the Venetian petition Manin and Tommaseo were  arrested and thrown into prison on January 18, 1848, charged with high  treason. The temper of the newly-aroused people was uncertain, on the  morning after the arrest the streets of Venice were seen blossoming with  signs ominous to peace and Austrian supremacy, \"Viva l'Italia!\" \"Viva  Manin e Tommaseo!\" and \"Morte ai Tedeschi!\"    From the date of his imprisonment Manin underwent many sufferings, one  of the chief being his inability longer to help in nursing a daughter to  whom he was passionately devoted and who was suffering from a tedious  and most painful nervous disease. At almost the same time his younger  sister, who was ill in Trevisa, died from the shock of hearing of his  imprisonment. He had been able to save very little for dark days, now  that they were come he could do nothing to tide his little household  through them. Outwardly he was calm and strong of will, inwardly he was  tormented by a hundred fears. Yet he could write from prison to his  brave wife, saying, \"If you continue to be strong and courageous, these  will be the happiest days of my life.... You will find a few pieces of  gold in one drawer, a little silver in another.... If this affair lasts  long, we must think of providing for you in some way. Love one another,  my angels: be resigned, that is sufficient.\"    A valiant attempt was made by Teresa Manin to secure her husband's  release on bail, the authorities put her off continually, and finally  the Director-General replied that he did not believe himself authorized  to accede to her request. This final reply caused an outburst of popular  indignation. The Venetians dressed themselves in mourning, and with  heads bared filed slowly before the windows of the prison on the Riva  dei Schiavoni, where Manin and Tommaseo were confined. As long as he  remained in prison the other advocates united in caring for Manin's  legal practice, and high-spirited friends among all classes insisted  on providing his family with all necessities. He himself hoped to  be able to support them by reprinting a small treatise on Venetian  jurisprudence, but permission to advertise its sale was denied him by  the government. A little later, however, Austrian permissions became no  longer necessary, and Manin's family lived on the proceeds of the sale  of this work and on the small legacy left to him by his sister. He had  little time to think of self-support when he became dictator.    The ancient spirit of Venice was slowly rising as day after day news  came that men throughout Italy were turning on their despots. The  Nicoletti and the Castellani, the two historic factions of the people,  the blacks and the reds, renounced their ancient feud and took a common  secret oath to war only with Austria until Venice was free. The young  nobles resigned their Austrian offices and ranks, they had heard what  the nobility of Milan were accomplishing."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman — Complete (#13)"],[1,"na, especially ridiculing his quarter of the city, then called  Happy Valley.  At that day Montgomery Street was, as now, the  business street, extending from Jackson to Sacramento, the water of  the bay leaving barely room for a few houses on its east side, and  the public warehouses were on a sandy beach about where the Bank of  California now stands, viz., near the intersection of Sansome and  California, Streets.  Along Montgomery Street were the stores of  Howard & Mellus, Frank Ward, Sherman & Ruckel, Ross & Co., and it  may be one or two others.  Around the Plaza were a few houses,  among them the City Hotel and the Custom-House, single-story adobes  with tiled roofs, and they were by far the most substantial and  best houses in the place.  The population was estimated at about  four hundred, of whom Kanakas (natives of the Sandwich Islands)  formed the bulk.    At the foot of Clay Street was a small wharf which small boats  could reach at high tide; but the principal landing-place was where  some stones had fallen into the water, about where Broadway now  intersects Battery Street.  On the steep bluff above had been  excavated, by the navy, during the year before, a bench, wherein  were mounted a couple of navy-guns, styled the battery, which, I  suppose, gave name to the street.  I explained to Folsom the object  of my visit, and learned from him that he had no boat in which to  send me to Sonoma, and that the only, chance to get there was to  borrow a boat from the navy.  The line-of-battle-ship Columbus was  then lying at anchor off the town, and he said if I would get up  early the next morning I could go off to her in one of the  market-boats.    Accordingly, I was up bright and early, down at the wharf, found a  boat, and went off to the Columbus to see Commodore Biddle.  On  reaching the ship and stating to the officer of the deck my  business, I was shown into the commodore's cabin, and soon made  known to him my object.  Biddle was a small-sized man, but  vivacious in the extreme.  He had a perfect contempt for all  humbug, and at once entered into the business with extreme  alacrity.  I was somewhat amused at the importance he attached to  the step.  He had a chaplain, and a private secretary, in a small  room latticed off from his cabin, and he first called on them to go  out, and, when we were alone, he enlarged on the folly of Sloat's  proclamation, giving the people the right to elect their own  officers, and commended Kearney and Mason for nipping that idea in  the bud, and keeping the power in their own hands.  He then sent  for the first lieutenant (Drayton), and inquired if there were  among the officers on board any who had ever been in the Upper Bay,  and learning that there was a midshipman (Whittaker) he was sent  for.  It so happened that this midshipman had been on a frolic on  shore a few nights before, and was accordingly much frightened when  summoned into the commodore's presence, but as soon as he was  questioned as to his knowledge of the bay, he was sensibly  relieved, and professed to know every thing about it.    Accordingly, the long boat was ordered with this midshipman and  eight sailors, prepared with water and provisions for several days  absence.  Biddle then asked me if I knew any of his own officers,  and which one of them I would prefer to accompany me.  I knew most  of them, and we settled down on Louis McLane.  He was sent for, and  it was settled that McLane and I were to conduct this important  mission, and the commodore enjoined on us complete secrecy, so as  to insure success, and he especially cautioned us against being  pumped by his ward-room officers, Chapman, Lewis, Wise, etc., while  on board his ship.  With this injunction I was dismissed to the  wardroom, where I found Chapman, Lewis, and Wise, dreadfully  exercised at our profound secrecy.  The fact that McLane and I had  been closeted with the commodore for an hour, that orders for the  boat and stores had been made, that the chaplain and clerk had been  sent out of the cabin, etc., etc., all excited their curiosity; but  McLane and I kept our secret well.  The general impression was,  that we had some knowledge about the fate of Captain Montgomery's  two sons and the crew that had been lost the year before.  In 1846  Captain Montgomery commanded at Yerba Buena, on board the St. Mary  sloop-of-war, and he had a detachment of men stationed up at  Sonoma.  Occasionally a boat was sent up with provisions or  intelligence to them.  Montgomery had two sons on board his ship,  one a midshipman, the other his secretary.  Having occasion to send  some money up to Sonoma, he sent his two sons with a good boat and  crew.  The boat started with a strong breeze and a very large sail,  was watched from the deck until she was out of sight, and has never  been heard of since.  There was, of coarse, much speculation as to  their fate, some contending that the boat must have been capsized  in San Pablo Bay, and that all were lost; others contending that  the crew had murdered the officers for the money, and then escaped;  but, so far as I know, not a man of that crew has ever been seen or  heard of since.  When at last the boat was ready for us, we  started, leaving all hands, save the commodore, impressed with the  belief that we were going on some errand connected with the loss of  the missing boat and crew of the St. Mary.  We sailed directly  north, up the bay and across San Pablo, reached the month of Sonoma  Creek about dark, and during the night worked up the creek some  twelve miles by means of the tide, to a landing called the  Embarcadero.  To maintain the secrecy which the commodore had  enjoined on us, McLane and I agreed to keep up the delusion by  pretending to be on a marketing expedition to pick up chickens,  pigs, etc., for the mess of the Columbus, soon to depart for home.    Leaving the midshipman and four sailors to guard the boat, we  started on foot with the other four for Sonoma Town, which we soon  reached.  It was a simple open square, around which were some  adobe-houses, that of General Vallejo occupying one side.  On  another was an unfinished two-story adobe building, occupied as a  barrack by Bracken's company.  We soon found Captain Brackett, and  I told him that I intended to take Nash a prisoner and convey him  back to Monterey to answer for his mutinous behavior.  I got an old  sergeant of his company, whom I had known in the Third Artillery,  quietly to ascertain the whereabouts of Nash, who was a bachelor,  stopping with the family of a lawyer named Green.  The sergeant  soon returned, saying that Nash had gone over to Napa, but would be  back that evening; so McLane and I went up to a farm of some  pretensions, occupied by one Andreas Hoepner, with a pretty Sitka  wife, who lived a couple of miles above Sonoma, and we bought of  him some chickens, pigs, etc.  We then visited Governor Boggs's  family and that of General Vallejo, who was then, as now, one of  the most prominent and influential natives of California.  About  dark I learned that Nash had come back, and then, giving Brackett  orders to have a cart ready at the corner of the plaza, McLane and  I went to the house of Green.  Posting an armed sailor on each side  of the house, we knocked at the door and walked in.  We found  Green, Nash, and two women, at supper.  I inquired if Nash were in,  and was first answered \"No,\" but one of the women soon pointed to  him, and he rose.  We were armed with pistols, and the family was  evidently alarmed.  I walked up to him and took his arm, and told  him to come along with me.  He asked me, \"Where?\" and I said,  \"Monterey.\"   \"Why?\" I would explain that more at leisure.  Green  put himself between me and the door, and demanded, in theatrical  style, why I dared arrest a peaceable citizen in his house.  I  simply pointed to my pistol, and told him to get out of the way,  which he did.  Nash asked to get some clothing, but I told him he  should want for nothing.  We passed out, Green following us with  loud words, which brought the four sailors to the front-door, when  I told him to hush up or I would take him prisoner also.  About  that time one of the sailors, handling his pistol carelessly,  discharged it, and Green disappeared very suddenly.  We took Nash  to the cart, put him in, and proceeded back to our boat.  The next  morning we were gone.    Nash being out of the way, Boggs entered on his office, and the  right to appoint or remove from civil office was never again  questioned in California during the military regime.  Nash was an  old man, and was very much alarmed for his personal safety.  He had  come across the Plains, and had never yet seen the sea.  While on  our way down the bay, I explained fully to him the state of things  in California, and he admitted he had never looked on it in that  light before, and professed a willingness to surrender his office;  but, having gone so far, I thought it best to take him to Monterey.  On our way down the bay the wind was so strong, as we approached  the Columbus, that we had to take refuge behind Yerba Buena Island,  then called Goat Island, where we landed, and I killed a gray seal.  The next morning, the wind being comparatively light, we got out  and worked our way up to the Columbus, where I left my prisoner on  board, and went on shore to find Commodore Biddle, who had gone to  dine with Frank Ward.  I found him there, and committed Nash to his  charge, with the request that he would send him down to Monterey,  which he did in the sloop-of-war Dale, Captain Selfridge  commanding.  I then returned to Monterey by land, and, when the  Dale arrived, Colonel Mason and I went on board, found poor old Mr.  Nash half dead with sea-sickness and fear, lest Colonel Mason would  treat him with extreme military rigor.  But, on the contrary, the  colonel spoke to him kindly, released him as a prisoner on his  promise to go back to "]]]
