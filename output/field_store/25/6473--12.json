The animosities too between the ladies  administered fresh fuel; while towards Agrippina, Livia was actuated  by the despite natural to step-mothers: and over-tempestuous was the  indignation of Agrippina; only that her known chastity and love for her  husband, always gave her mind, however vehement, a virtuous turn.    But Germanicus, the nearer he stood to supreme rule, the more vigour he  exerted to secure it to Tiberius: to him he obliged the Sequanians, a  neighbouring people, as also the several Belgic cities, to swear present  allegiance; and the moment he learnt the uproar of the legions, posted  thither: he found them advanced without the camp to receive him, with  eyes cast down, in feigned token of remorse. After he entered the  entrenchments, instantly his ears were filled with plaints and  grievances, uttered in hideous and mixed clamours: nay, some catching  his hand, as if they meant to kiss it, thrust his fingers into their  mouths, to feel their gums destitute of teeth; others showed their limbs  enfeebled, and bodies stooping under old age. As he saw the assembly  mixed at random, he commanded them \"to range themselves into companies,  thence more distinctly to hear his answers; as also to place before  them their several ensigns, that the cohorts at least might be  distinguished.\"    With slowness and reluctance it was, that they obeyed him; then  beginning with an encomium upon the \"venerable memory of Augustus,\" he  proceeded to the \"many victories and many triumphs of Tiberius,\" and  with peculiar praises celebrated the \"glorious and immortal deeds, which  with these very legions in Germany he had accomplished;\" he next boasted  the quiet state of things, the consent of all Italy, the loyal faith  of both the Gauls: and every quarter of the Roman State exempt from  disaffection and turbulence.    Thus far they listened with silence, at least with moderate murmuring;  but the moment he touched their sedition and questioned, \"where now was  the wonted modesty of soldiers? where the glory of ancient discipline?  whither had they chased their Tribunes, whither their Centurions?\" to a  man, they stripped themselves to the skin, and there exposed the seams  of their wounds and bruises of their chastisements, in the rage of  reproach. Then in the undistinguished voice of uproar, they urged  \"the exactions for occasional exemptions, their scanty pay, and their  rigorous labours;\" which they represented in a long detail: \"ramparts to  be reared, entrenchments digged, trees felled and drawn, forage cut and  carried, fuel prepared and fetched,\" with every other article of  toil required by the exigencies of war, or to prevent idleness in the  soldiery. Above all, from the veterans arose a cry most horrible:  they enumerated thirty years or upwards undergone in the service; \"and  besought that to men utterly spent he would administer respite, nor  suffer them to be beholden to death for the last relief from their  toils; but discharge them from a warfare so lasting and severe, and  grant them the means of a comfortable recess.\" Nay, some there were  who of him required the money bequeathed them by Augustus; and towards  Germanicus uttering zealous vows, with omens of happy fortune, declared  their cordial attachment to his cause if he would himself assume the  Empire. Here, as if already stained with their treason, he leaped  headlong from the Tribunal; but with swords drawn they opposed his  departure, and threatened his life, if he refused to return: yet, with  passionate protestations that \"he would rather die than be a traitor,\"  he snatched his sword from his side, and aiming full at his breast,  would have buried it there, had not those who were next him seized his  hand and by force restrained him. A cluster of soldiers in the extremity  of the assembly exhorted him, nay, what is incredible to hear, some  particulars advancing nearer, exhorted him _to strike home_: in truth  one Calusidius, a common soldier, presented him his naked sword, and  added, \"it is sharper than your own;\" a behaviour which to the rest,  outrageous as they were, seemed savage, and of horrid example: hence the  friends of Germanicus had time to snatch him away to his tent.    It was here consulted what remedy to apply: for it was advised, that  \"ministers of sedition were preparing to be despatched to the other  army, to draw them too into a confederacy in the revolt; that the  capital of the Ubians was destined to be sacked; and if their hands were  once inured to plunder, they would break in, and ravage all Gaul.\" This  dread was augmented by another: the enemy knew of the sedition in the  Roman army, and were ready to invade the Empire, if its barrier the  Rhine were left unguarded. Now, to arm the allies and the auxiliaries of  Rome, and lead them against the departing legions, was to rouse a civil  war: severity was dangerous: the way of largesses infamous; and alike  threatening it was to the State to grant the turbulent soldiers nothing,  or yield them everything. After revolving every reason and objection,  the result was, to feign letters and directions from Tiberius, \"that  those who had served twenty years should be finally discharged; such as  served sixteen be under the ensign and privileges of veterans, released  from every duty but that of repulsing the enemy; and the legacy, which  they demanded, should be paid and doubled.\"    The soldiers, who perceived that, purely to evade present difficulty,  the concessions were forged, insisted to have them forthwith executed;  and instantly the Tribunes despatched the discharge of the veterans:  that of the money was adjourned to their several winter quarters; but  the fifth legion, and the one-and-twentieth, refused to stir, till in  that very camp they were paid; so that out of the money reserved by  himself and his friends for travailing expenses, Germanicus was obliged  to raise the sum. Caecina, Lieutenant-General, led the first legion and  twentieth back to the capital of the Ubians: an infamous march, when the  plunder of their General's coffers was carried amidst the ensigns and  Roman Eagles. Germanicus, the while, proceeding to the army in higher  Germany, brought the second, thirteenth, and sixteenth legions to swear  allegiance without hesitation: to the fourteenth, who manifested some  short suspense, he made unasked a tender of their money, and a present  discharge.    But a party of veterans which belonged to the disorderly legions, and  then in garrison among the Chaucians, as they began a sedition there,  were somewhat quelled by the instant execution of two of their body: an  execution this, commanded by Maenius, Camp-Marshal, and rather of good  example, than done by competent authority. The tumult, however, swelling  again with fresh rage, he fled, but was discovered; so that, finding  no safety in lurking, from his own bravery he drew his defence, and  declared \"that to himself, who was only their Camp-Marshal, these their  outrages were not done, but done to the authority of Germanicus, their  General, to the majesty of Tiberius their Emperor.\" At the same time,  braving and dismaying all that would have stopped him, he fiercely  snatched the colours, faced about towards the Rhine, and pronouncing  the doom of traitors and deserters to every man who forsook his ranks,  brought them back to their winter quarters, mutinous, in truth, but not  daring to mutiny.    In the meantime the deputies from the Senate met Germanicus at the  altar of the Ubians [Footnote: Cologne.], whither in his return he was  arrived. Two legions wintered there, the first and twentieth, with the  soldiers lately placed under the standard of veterans; men already under  the distractions of guilt and fear: and now a new terror possessed them,  that these Senators were come armed with injunctions to cancel every  concession which they had by sedition extorted; and, as it is the custom  of the crowd to be ever charging somebody with the crimes suggested by  their own false alarms, the guilt of this imaginary decree they laid  upon Minutius Plancus, a Senator of consular dignity, and at the head of  this deputation. In the dead of night, they began to clamour aloud for  the purple standard placed in the quarters of Germanicus, and, rushing  tumultuously to his gate, burst the doors, dragged the Prince out of his  bed, and, with menaces of present death, compelled him to deliver the  standard. Then, as they roved about the camp, they met the deputies,  who, having learnt the outrage, were hastening to Germanicus: upon  them they poured a deluge of contumelies, and to present slaughter were  devoting them, Plancus chiefly, whom the dignity of his character had  restrained from flight; nor in this mortal danger had he other refuge  than the quarters of the first legion, where, embracing the Eagle and  other ensigns, he sought sanctuary from the religious veneration  ever paid them. But, in spite of religion, had not Calpurnius, the  Eagle-bearer, by force defeated the last violence of the assault, in the  Roman camp had been slain an ambassador of the Roman People, and  with his blood had been stained the inviolable altars of the Gods; a  barbarity rare even in the camp of an enemy. At last, day returning,  when the General, and the soldiers, and their actions could be  distinguished, Germanicus entered the camp, and commanding Plancus to  be brought, seated him by himself upon the tribunal: he then inveighed  against the late \"pernicious frenzy, which in it, he said, had fatality,  and was rekindled by no despite in the soldiers, but by that of the  angry Gods.\" He explained the genuine purposes of that embassy, and  lamented with affecting eloquence \"the outrage committed upon Plancus,  altogether brutal and unprovoked; the foul violence done to the sacred  person of an Ambassador, and the mighty disgrace from thence derived  upon the legion.\" Yet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7960"],[0,"Early European History (#13)"],[1,"territory, were brought under  one government.    CHARACTER OF ASSYRIAN RULE    This unification of the Orient was accomplished only at a fearful cost.  The records of Assyria are full of terrible deeds--of towns and cities  without number given to the flames, of the devastation of fertile fields  and orchards, of the slaughter of men, women, and children, of the  enslavement of entire nations. Assyrian monarchs, in numerous  inscriptions, boast of the wreck and ruin they brought to many flourishing  lands.    [Illustration: AN ASSYRIAN  From a Nineveh bas-relief. The original is colored.]    SARGON II, 722-705 B.C.    The treatment of conquered peoples by the Assyrian rulers is well  illustrated by their dealings with the Hebrews. One of the mightiest  monarchs was an usurper, who ascended the throne as Sargon II. Shortly  after his succession he turned his attention to the kingdom of Israel,  which had revolted. Sargon in punishment took its capital city of Samaria  (722 B.C.) and led away many thousands of the leading citizens into a  lifelong captivity in distant Assyria. The Ten Tribes mingled with the  population of that region and henceforth disappeared from history.    [Illustration: ANCIENT ORIENTAL EMPIRES    Map, THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE about 660 B.C.    Map, LYDIA, MEDIA, BABYLONIA and EGYPT about 550 B.C.]    SENNACHERIB, 705-681 B.C.    Sargon's son, Sennacherib, though not the greatest, is the best known of  Assyrian kings. His name is familiar from the many references to him in  Old Testament writings. An inscription by Sennacherib describes an  expedition against Hezekiah, king of Judea, who was shut up \"like a caged  bird in his royal city of Jerusalem.\" Sennacherib, however, did not  capture the place. His troops were swept away by a pestilence. The ancient  Hebrew writer conceives it as the visitation of a destroying angel: \"It  came to pass that night that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in  the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand; and when  men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.\" [11]  So Sennacherib departed, and returned with a shattered army to Nineveh,  his capital.    [Illustration: AN ASSYRIAN RELIEF (British Museum, London)  The relief represents the siege and capture of Lachish, a city of the  Canaanites, by Sennacherib's troops. Notice the total absence of  perspective in this work.]    DOWNFALL OF ASSYRIA, 606 B.C.    Although Assyria recovered from this disaster, its empire rested on  unstable foundations. The subject races were attached to their oppressive  masters by no ties save those of force. When Assyria grew exhausted by its  career of conquest, they were quick to strike a blow for freedom. By the  middle of the seventh century Egypt had secured her independence, and many  other provinces were ready to revolt. Meanwhile, beyond the eastern  mountains, the Medes were gathering ominously on the Assyrian frontier.  The storm broke when the Median monarch, in alliance with the king of  Babylon, moved upon Nineveh and captured it. The city was utterly  destroyed.    [Illustration: THE ISHTAR GATE, BABYLON  Explorations on the site of Babylon have been conducted since 1899 A.D. by  the German Oriental Society. Large parts of the temple area, as well as  sections of the royal palaces, have been uncovered. The most important  structure found is the Ishtar Gate. The towers which flank it are adorned  with figures of dragons and bulls in brilliantly colored glazed tile.]    PARTITION OF ASSYRIA    After the conquest of the Assyrian Empire the victors proceeded to divide  the spoils. The share of Media was Assyria itself, together with the long  stretch of mountain country extending from the Persian Gulf to Asia Minor.  Babylonia obtained the western half of the Assyrian domains, including the  Euphrates valley and Syria. Under its famous king, Nebuchadnezzar (604-561  B.C.), Babylonia became a great power in the Orient. It was Nebuchadnezzar  who brought the kingdom of Judea to an end. He captured Jerusalem in 586  B.C., burned the Temple, and carried away many Jews into captivity. The  day of their deliverance, when Babylon itself should bow to a foreign foe,  was still far distant.      12. THE WORLD EMPIRE OF PERSIA    CYRUS THE GREAT, 553-529 B.C.    Not much earlier than the break-up of the Assyrian Empire, we find a new  and vigorous people pressing into western Iran. They were the Persians,  near kinsmen of the Medes. Subjects at first of Assyria, and then of  Media, they regained their independence and secured imperial power under a  conquering king whom history knows as Cyrus the Great. In 553 B.C. Cyrus  revolted against the Median monarch and three years later captured the  royal city of Ecbatana. The Medes and Persians formed henceforth a united  people.    [Illustration: THE TOMB OF CYRUS THE GREAT  The mausoleum is built of immense marble blocks joined together without  cement. Its total height including the seven steps is about thirty five  feet. A solitary pillar near the tomb still bears the inscription 'I am  Cyrus, the King, the Achaemenian.']    CONQUEST OF LYDIA BY CYRUS, 546 B.C.    The conquest of Media was soon followed by a war with the Lydians, who had  been allies of the Medes. The throne of Lydia, a state in the western part  of Asia Minor, was at this time held by Croesus, the last and most famous  of his line. The king grew so wealthy from the tribute paid by Lydian  subjects and from his gold mines that his name has passed into the  proverb, \"rich as Croesus.\" He viewed with alarm the rising power of Cyrus  and rashly offered battle to the Persian monarch. Defeated in the open  field, Croesus shut himself up in Sardis, his capital. The city was soon  taken, however, and with its capture the Lydian kingdom came to an end.    CAPTURE OF BABYLON, 539 B.C.    The downfall of Lydia prepared the way for a Persian attack on Babylonia.  The conquest of that country proved unexpectedly easy. In 539 B.C. the  great city of Babylon opened its gates to the Persian host. Shortly  afterwards Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jewish exiles there to  return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple, which Nebuchadnezzar had  destroyed. With the surrender of Babylon the last Semitic empire in the  East came to an end. The Medes and Persians, an Indo-European people,  henceforth ruled over a wider realm than ever before had been formed in  Oriental lands.    CAMBYSES, 529-522 B.C.    Cyrus was followed by his son, Cambyses, a cruel but stronghanded despot.  Cambyses determined to add Egypt to the Persian dominions. His land army  was supported by a powerful fleet, to which the Phoenicians and the Greeks  of Cyprus contributed ships. A single battle sufficed to overthrow the  Egyptian power and to bring the long rule of the Pharaohs to a close. [12]    DARIUS THE GREAT, 521-485 B.C.    The reign of Darius, the successor of Cambyses, was marked by further  extensions of the frontiers. An expedition to the distant East added to  the empire the region of the Punjab, [13] along the upper waters of the  Indus. Another expedition against the wild Scythian tribes along the  Danube led to conquests in Europe and brought the Persian dominions close  to those of the Greeks. Not without reason could Darius describe himself  in an inscription which still survives, as \"the great king, king of kings,  king of countries, king of all men.\"    [Illustration: DARIUS WITH HIS ATTENDANTS  Bas-relief at Persepolis. The monarch's right hand grasps a staff or  scepter, his left hand, a bunch of flowers. His head is surmounted by a  crown, his body is enveloped in the long Median mantle.

In the rear  are two Persian nobles, one carrying the royal fan, the other the royal  parasol.]    [Illustration: ROCK SEPULCHERS OF THE PERSIAN KINGS  The tombs are those of Darius, Xerxes, and two of their successors. They  are near Persepolis.]    ORGANIZATION OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE    It was the work of Darius to provide for his dominions a stable government  which should preserve what the sword had won. The problem was difficult.  The empire was a collection of many peoples widely different in race,  language, customs, and religion. Darius did not attempt to weld the  conquered nations into unity. As long as the subjects of Persia paid  tribute and furnished troops for the royal army, they were allowed to  conduct their own affairs with little interference from the Great King.    THE SATRAPAL SYSTEM    The entire empire, excluding Persia proper, was divided into twenty  satrapies, or provinces, each one with its civil governor, or satrap. The  satraps carried out the laws and collected the heavy tribute annually  levied throughout the empire. In most of the provinces there were also  military governors who commanded the army and reported directly to the  king. This device of intrusting the civil and military functions to  separate officials lessened the danger of revolts against the Persian  authority. As an additional precaution Darius provided special agents  whose business it was to travel from province to province and investigate  the conduct of his officials. It became a proverb that \"the king has many  eyes and many ears.\"    PERSIAN ROADS    Darius also established a system of military roads throughout the Persian  dominions. The roads were provided at frequent intervals with inns, where  postmen stood always in readiness to take up a letter and carry it to the  next station. The Royal Road from Susa, the Persian capital, to Sardis in  Lydia was over fifteen hundred miles long; but government couriers, using  relays of fresh horses, could cover the distance within a week. An old  Greek writer declares with admiration that \"there is nothing mortal more  swift than these messengers.\" [14]    UNION OF THE EAST UNDER PERSIA    The political history of the"]]]
