The morning Daily Ledger was in his  hand, but he was not reading. His mind, judging from his absorbed look,  was occupied with other thoughts.    \"I can hardly realize,\" he said half-aloud, \"that my boy will so soon  be restored to my arms. We have been separated by a cruel fate, but we  shall soon be together again. I remember how the dear child looked when  I left him at Fultonville in the care of the kind inn-keeper. I am  sorry he is dead, but his widow shall be suitably repaid for her kind  devotion.\"    He had reached this point when a knock was heard at the door.    \"Come in!\" said Mr. Granville.    A servant of the hotel appeared.    \"A lady and a boy are in the parlor below, sir. They wish to see you.\"    Though Mr. Granville had considerable control over his feelings, his  heart beat fast when he heard these words.    \"Will you show them up at once?\" he said, in a tone which showed some  trace of agitation.    The servant bore the message to Mrs. Brent and Jonas, who were sitting  in the hotel parlor.    If Mr. Granville was agitated, the two conspirators were not wholly at  their ease. There was a red spot on each of Mrs. Brent's cheeks--her  way of expressing emotion--and Jonas was fidgeting about uneasily in his  chair, staring about him curiously.    \"Mind what I told you,\" said his mother, in a low voice. \"Remember to  act like a boy who has suddenly been restored to his long-lost father.  Everything depends on first impressions.\"    \"I wish it was all over; I wish I was out of it,\" said Jonas, wiping the  perspiration from his face. \"Suppose he suspects?\"    \"He won't if you do as I tell you. Don't look gawky, but act naturally.\"    Just then the servant reappeared.    \"You are to come up-stairs,\" he said. \"The gentleman will see you.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Brent, rising. \"Come.\"    Jonas rose, and with the manner of a cur that expected a whipping,  followed his mother and the servant.    \"It's only one flight,\" said the servant, \"but we can take the  elevator.\"    \"It is of no consequence,\" Mrs. Brent began, but Jonas said eagerly:    \"Let's ride on the elevator, ma!\"    \"Very well, Philip,\" said Mrs. Brent.    A minute later the two stood at the door of Mr. Granville's room. Next  they stood in his presence.    Mr. Granville, looking eagerly toward the door, passed over Mrs. Brent,  and his glance rested on the boy who followed her. He started, and there  was a quick feeling of disappointment. He had been picturing to himself  how his lost boy would look, but none of his visions resembled the  awkward-looking boy who stood sheepishly by the side of Mrs. Brent.    \"Mr. Granville, I presume,\" said the lady.    \"Yes, madam. You are----\"    \"Mrs. Brent, and this,\" pointing to Jonas, \"is the boy you left at  Fultonville thirteen years ago. Philip, go to your father.\"    Jonas advanced awkwardly to Mr. Granville's chair, and said in  parrot-like tones:    \"I'm so glad to see you, pa!\"    \"And you are really Philip?\" said Mr. Granville slowly.    \"Yes, I'm Philip Brent; but I suppose my name is Granville now.\"    \"Come here, my boy!\"    Mr. Granville drew the boy to him, and looked earnestly in his face,  then kissed him affectionately.    \"He has changed since he was a little child, Mrs. Brent,\" he said, with  a half-sigh.    \"That's to be expected, sir. He was only three years old when you left  him with us.\"    \"But it seems to me that his hair and complexion are lighter.\"    \"You can judge of that better than I,\" said Mrs. Brent plausibly. \"To  me, who have seen him daily, the change was not perceptible.\"    \"I am greatly indebted to you for your devoted care--to you and your  husband. I am grieved to hear that Mr. Brent is dead.\"    \"Yes, sir; he left me six months since. It was a grievous loss. Ah, sir,  when I give up Philip also, I shall feel quite alone in the world,\" and  she pressed a handkerchief to her eyes. \"You see, I have come to look  upon him as my own boy!\"    \"My dear madam, don't think that I shall be so cruel as to take him from  you. Though I wish him now to live with me, you must accompany him. My  home shall be yours if you are willing to accept a room in my house and  a seat at my table.\"    \"Oh, Mr. Granville, how can I thank you for your great kindness? Ever  since I received your letter I have been depressed with the thought  that I should lose dear Philip. If I had a child of my own it would be  different; but, having none, my affections are centered upon him.\"    \"And very naturally,\" said Mr. Granville. \"We become attached to those  whom we benefit. Doubtless he feels a like affection for you. You love  this good lady, Philip, who has supplied to you the place of your own  mother, who died in your infancy, do you not?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" answered Jonas stolidly. \"But I want to live with my pa!\"    \"To be sure you shall. My boy, we have been separated too long already.  Henceforth we will live together, and Mrs. Brent shall live with us.\"    \"Where do you live, pa?\" asked Jonas.    \"I have a country-seat a few miles from Chicago,\" answered Mr.  Granville. \"We will go there as soon as I am well enough. I ought to  apologize, Mrs. Brent, for inviting you up to my room, but my rheumatism  makes me a prisoner.\"    \"I hope your rheumatism will soon leave you, sir.\"    \"I think it will. I have an excellent physician, and already I am much  better. I may, however, have to remain here a few days yet.\"    \"And where do you wish Philip and I to remain in the meantime?\"    \"Here, of course. Philip, will you ring the bell?\"    \"I don't see any bell,\" answered Jonas, bewildered.    \"Touch that knob!\"    Jonas did so.    \"Will that ring the bell?\" he asked curiously.    \"Yes, it is an electric bell.\"    \"By gosh!\" ejaculated Jonas.    \"Don't use such language, Philip!\" said Mrs. Brent hastily. \"Your father  will be shocked. You see, Mr. Granville, Philip has associated with  country boys, and in spite of my care, he has adopted some of their  language.\"    Mr. Granville himself was rather disturbed by this countrified  utterance, and it occurred to him that his new-found son needed  considerable polishing.    \"Ah, I quite understand that, Mrs. Brent,\" he said courteously. \"He is  young yet, and there will be plenty of time for him to get rid of any  objectionable habits and phrases.\"    Here the servant appeared.    \"Tell the clerk to assign this lady and the boy rooms on this floor if  any are vacant. Mrs. Brent, Philip may have a room next to you for the  present. When I am better I will have him with me. John, is dinner on  the table?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then, after taking possession of your rooms, you and Philip had better  go to dinner. I will send for him later.\"    \"Thank you, sir.\"    As Mrs. Brent was ushered into her handsome apartment her face was  radiant with joy and exultation.    \"All has gone well!\" she said. \"The most difficult part is over.\"        CHAPTER XIX.    A NARROW ESCAPE FROM DETECTION.    The conspiracy into which Mrs. Brent had entered was a daring one, and  required great coolness and audacity. But the inducements were great,  and for her son's sake she decided to carry it through. Of course it  was necessary that she should not be identified with any one who could  disclose to Mr. Granville the deceit that was being practiced upon him.  Circumstances lessened the risk of detection, since Mr. Granville was  confined to his room in the hotel, and for a week she and Jonas went  about the city alone.    One day she had a scare.    She was occupying a seat in a Chestnut Street car, while Jonas stood  in front with the driver, when a gentleman whom she had not observed,  sitting at the other end of the car, espied her.    \"Why, Mrs. Brent, how came you here?\" he asked, in surprise, crossing  over and taking a seat beside her.    Her color went and came as, in a subdued tone, she answered.    \"I am in Philadelphia on a little visit, Mr. Pearson.\"    \"Are you not rather out of your latitude?\" asked the gentleman.    \"Yes, perhaps so.\"    \"How is Mr. Brent?\"    \"Did you not hear that he was dead?\"    \"No, indeed! I sympathize with you in your sad loss.\"    \"Yes,\" sighed the widow. \"It is a great loss to us.\"    \"I suppose Jonas is a large boy now,\" said the other. \"I haven't seen  him for two or three years.\"    \"Yes, he has grown,\" said the widow briefly. She hoped that Mr. Pearson  would not discover that Jonas was with her, as she feared that the boy  might betray them unconsciously.    \"Is he with you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Do you stay long in Philadelphia?\"    \"No, I think not,\" answered Mrs. Brent.    \"I go back to New York this afternoon, or I would ask permission to call  on you.\"    Mrs. Brent breathed more freely. A call at the hotel was by all means to  be avoided.    \"Of course I should have been glad to see you,\" she answered, feeling  quite safe in saying so. \"Are you going far?\"    \"I get out at Thirteenth Street.\"    \"Thank Heaven!\" said Mrs. Brent to herself. \"Then he won't discover  where we are.\"    The Continental Hotel is situated at the corner of Chestnut and Ninth  Streets, and Mrs. Brent feared that Jonas would stop the car at that  point. As it was, the boy did not observe that his mother had met an  acquaintance, so intent was he on watching the street sights.    When they reached Ninth Street mother and son got out and entered the  hotel.    \"I guess I'll stay down stairs awhile,\" said Jonas.    \"No, Philip, I have something to say to you. Come up with me.\"    \"I want to go into the billiard-room,\" said Jonas, grumbling.    \"It is very important,\" said Mrs. Brent emphatically.    Now the curiosity of Jonas was excited, and he followed his mother into  the elevator, for their rooms were on the third floor.    \"Well, mother, what is it?\" asked Jonas, when the door of his mother's  room was closed behind them.    \"I met a gentleman who knew me in the horse-car,\" said Mrs. Brent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#13)"],[1,"writers for making too much of the wickedness  that has existed in the church; who declares in the introduction of  his Church History that genuine piety is the only thing he intends to  celebrate, and announces it to be his purpose to write the history  of those men only, irrespective of the external church to which they  belonged, who have been real not nominally Christians [1]--even Milner,  I say, admits and deplores the mischief wrought by these periods of  peace which came to the church between the storms of persecution which  plagued it; and refers in several places to the marked and steady  declension of the Christian spirit in those centuries with which at  present I am dealing. He admits that a gloomy cloud hung over the  conclusion of the first century; and argues that the first impressions  made by the effusion of the spirit are generally the strongest; that  human depravity, overborn for a time, arises afresh, particularly in  the next generation--hence the disorders of schism and heresy that  arose in the church, the tendency of which was to destroy the work of  God. [2]    The same writer upon the authority of Origen says that the long peace  granted the church in the third century produced a great degree of  luke-warmness and religious indecorum. \"Let the reader,\" says he, \"only  notice the indifference which he [Origen] here describes, and the  conduct of the Christians both in the first and second century, and he  will be affected with the greatness of the declension.\" Then follows  the picture drawn by Origen: \"Several come to church only on solemn  festivals; and then not so much for instruction as diversion. Some go  out again as soon as they have heard the lecture, without conferring  or asking the pastors questions. Others stay not till the lecture is  ended; and others hear not so much as a single word; but entertain  themselves in a corner of the church.\"    Coming to the middle of the third century, just previous to that severe  persecution inaugurated by the Emperor Decius, and speaking of Cyprian,  bishop of Carthage: Milman exclaims: \"A star of the first magnitude!  when we consider the times in which he lived. Let us recreate ourselves  with the contemplation of it. _We are fatigued with hunting for  Christian goodness; and we have discovered but little and that little  with much difficulty_. We shall find Cyprian to be a character who  partook indeed of the declension which we have noticed and lamented;  but who was still far superior, I apprehend, in real simplicity and  piety to the Christians of the East.\" [3] This same Cyprian, in whom  Milner delights, speaking of the effects of the long peace which  preceded the Decian persecution, says: \"Each had been bent on improving  his own patrimony; and had forgotten what believers had done under the  apostles, and what they ought always to do. They were brooding over the  arts of amassing wealth; the pastors and the deacons each forgot their  duty; works of mercy were neglected, and discipline was at the lowest  ebb; luxury and effeminacy prevailed; meritricious arts in dress were  cultivated; fraud and deception practiced among brethren. Christians  would unite themselves in matrimony with unbelievers; could swear  not only without reverence but even without veracity. With haughty  asperity they despised their ecclesiastical superiors; they railed  against one another with outrageous acrimony, and conducted quarrels  with determined malice. Even many bishops, who ought to be guides and  patterns to the rest, neglected the peculiar duties of their stations,  gave themselves up to secular pursuits. They deserted their places of  residence and their flocks; they traveled through distant provinces in  quest of pleasure and gain; gave no assistance to the needy brethren;  but were insatiable in their thirst of money. They possessed estates  by fraud and multiplied usury. What have we not deserved to suffer  for such conduct? Even the divine word hath foretold us what we might  expect: 'If his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments, I  will visit their offenses with the rod and their sins with scourges.'  These things had been denounced and foretold, but in vain. Our sins  had brought our affairs to that pass, that because we had despised  the Lord's directions, we were obliged to undergo a correction of our  multiplied evils and a trial of our faith by severe remedies.\" [4]    The last forty years of the third century were years of peace to the  church. That period began with the ascension of Gallienius, a man of  taste, indolence, philosophy and toleration, to the throne; and his  example was followed by the emperors to the end of the century. A new  scene this, Christianity tolerated by a pagan government for forty  years! \"This new scene did not prove favorable to the growth of grace  and holiness,\" writes Milner. \"In no period since the apostles was  there ever so great a general decay as in this; not even in particular  instances can we discover during this interval, much of lively  Christianity.\" [5]    Though conscious of having already quoted copiously upon the point  under consideration, I cannot withhold the testimony of Eusebius who  was a witness of the effects of that peace granted the church previous  to the last great pagan persecution, the Diocletian. After describing  the multitudes which flocked into the church before the declension  in the spirit of true Christianity so greatly prevailed, he remarks:  \"Nor was any malignant demon able to infatuate, no human machinations  prevent them so long as the providential hand of God superintended and  guarded his people as the worthy subjects of his care. But when by  reason of excessive liberty, we sunk into negligence and sloth, one  envying and reviling another in different ways, and we were almost, as  it were, upon the point of taking up arms against each other with words  as with darts and spears, prelates inveighing against prelates, and  people rising up against people, and hypocrisy and dissimulation had  arisen to the greatest height of malignity, then the divine judgment,  which usually proceeds with a lenient hand, whilst the multitudes were  yet crowding into the church, with gentle and mild visitation began  to afflict the episcopacy; the persecution having begun with those  brethren in the army. But as if destitute of all sensibility, we were  not prompt in measures to appease and propitiate the Deity; some indeed  like atheists, regarding our situation as unheeded and unobserved  by a Providence, we added one wickedness and misery to another. But  some that appeared to be our pastors deserting the law of piety, were  inflamed against each other with mutual strifes, only accumulating  quarrels and threats, rivalship, hostility and hatred to each other,  only anxious to assert the government as a kind of sovereignty for  themselves.\" [6]    Let it be remembered that this is quoted from a writer contemporary  with the events, and who says in the very chapter following the one  from which the foregoing is taken that it was not for him to record the  dissensions and follies which the shepherds of the people exercised  against each other before the persecution. He also adds: \"We shall  not make mention of those that were shaken by the persecution, nor of  those that suffered shipwreck in their salvation, and of their own  accord were sunk in the depths of the watery gulf.\" [7] Then in his  Book of Martyrs, referring to events that occurred between the edicts  ordering the persecution, he says: \"But the events that occurred in  the intermediate times, besides those already related, I have thought  proper to pass by; I mean more particularly the circumstances of the  different heads of the churches, who from being shepherds of the  reasonable flocks of Christ, that did not govern in a lawful and  becoming manner, were condemned, by divine justice, as unworthy of  such a charge, to be the keepers of the unreasonable camel, an animal  deformed in the structure of his body; and condemned further to be the  keepers of the imperial horses. * * * Moreover, the ambitious aspirings  of many to office, and the injudicious and unlawful ordinations that  took place, the divisions among the confessors themselves, the great  schisms and difficulties industriously fomented by the factions among  the new members, against the relics of the church, devising one  innovation after another, and unmercifully thrusting them into the  midst of all these calamities, heaping up affliction upon affliction.  All this, I say, I have resolved to pass by, judging it foreign to my  purpose, wishing, as I said in the beginning, to shun and avoid giving  an account of them.\" [8]    Hence, however bad the condition of the church is represented to be  by ecclesiastical writers, we must know that it was still worse than  that; however numerous the schisms; however unholy the ambition of  aspiring prelates; however frequent and serious the innovations upon  the primitive ordinances of the gospel; however great the confusion  and apostasy in the church is represented to be; we must know that it  is still worse than that, since the church historians contemporaneous  with the events refused to record these things in their fullness lest  it should prove disastrous to the church; just as some of our modern  scholars professing to write church history express their determination  to close their eyes to the corruption and abuses which form the greater  part of the melancholy story of ecclesiastical history, for fear  that relating these things would make it appear that real religion  scarcely had any existence. [9] But it is all in vain. \"It is idle,  it is disingenuous,\" remarks the editor [10] of Gibbon's great work,  \"to deny or to dissemble the early depravations of Christianity, its  gradual but rapid departure from its primitive simplicity and purity,  still more from its"]]]
