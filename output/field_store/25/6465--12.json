It happened that  betweene twelve and one a clocke at midnight, there blew a mighty  storme of winde against the house, as though it would have blowne  the foundation thereof out of his place.  Hereupon the students  began to feare and goe out of their beds, comforting one another;  but they would not stirre out of the chamber; and the host of  the house ran out of doores, thinking the house would fall.  The  students lay neere unto the hall wherein Doctor Faustus lay, and  they heard a mighty noyse and hissing, as if the hall had beene  full of snakes and adders.  With that, the hall-doore flew open,  wherein Doctor Faustus was, that he began to cry for helpe,  saying, Murther, murther! but it came forth with halfe a voyce,  hollowly:  shortly after, they heard him no more.  But when it was  day, the students, that had taken no rest that night, arose and  went into the hall, in the which they left Doctor Faustus; where  notwithstanding they found not Faustus, but all the hall lay  sprinkled with blood, his braines cleaving to the wall, for the  devill had beaten him from one wall against another; in one corner  lay his eyes, in another his teeth; a pittifull and fearefull  sight to behold.  Then began the students to waile and weepe for  him, and sought for his body in many places.  Lastly, they came  into the yard, where they found his body lying on the horse-dung,  most monstrously torne and fearefull to behold, for his head and  all his joynts were dashed in peeces.  The fore-named students and  masters that were at his death, have obtained so much, that they  buried him in the village where he was so grievously tormented.  After the which they returned to Wittenberg; and comming into the  house of Faustus, they found the servant of Faustus very sad,  unto whom they opened all the matter, who tooke it exceeding  heavily.  There found they also this history of Doctor Faustus  noted and of him written, as is before declared, all save only  his end, the which was after by the students thereto annexed;  further, what his servant had noted thereof, was made in another  booke.  And you have heard that he held by him in his life the  spirit of faire Helena, the which had by him one sonne, the which  he named Justus Faustus:  even the same day of his death they  vanished away, both mother and sonne.  The house before was so  darke that scarce any body could abide therein.  The same night  Doctor Faustus appeared unto his servant lively, and shewed unto  him many secret things, the which he had done and hidden in his  lifetime.  Likewise there were certaine which saw Doctor Faustus  looke out of the window by night, as they passed by the house.\"  Sig.

THE OBVIOUS LESSON    And, whatever view of the accident be taken, whether the moralist shall  use it to point the text of a solemn or denunciatory warning, or whether  the materialist, swinging to the other extreme, scouts any other theory  than that of the \"fortuitous concurrence of atoms,\" there is scarcely a  thinking mortal who has heard of what happened who has not been deeply  stirred, in the sense of a personal bereavement, to a profound humility  and the conviction of his own insignificance in the greater universal  scheme.    Many there are whom the influences of religion do not move, and upon  whose hearts most generous sentiments knock in vain, who still are  overawed and bowed by the magnitude of this catastrophe. No matter what  they believe about it, the effect is the same. The effect is to reduce  a man from the swaggering braggart--the vainglorious lord of what he  sees--the self-made master of fate, of nature, of time, of space, of  everything--to his true microscopic stature in the cosmos. He goes in  tears to put together again the fragments of the few, small, pitiful  things that belonged to him.              \"Though Love may pine, and Reason chafe,            There came a Voice without reply.\"      The only comfort, all that can bring surcease of sorrow, is that men  fashioned in the image of their Maker rose to the emergency like heroes,  and went to their grave as bravely as any who have given their lives  at any time in war. The hearts of those who waited on the land, and  agonized, and were impotent to save, have been laid upon the same altars  of sacrifice. The mourning of those who will not be comforted rises from  alien lands together with our own in a common broken intercession. How  little is the 882 feet of the \"monster\" that we launched compared with  the arc of the rainbow we can see even in our grief spanning the frozen  boreal mist!              \"The best of what we do and are,            Just God, forgive!\"      THE ANCIENT SACRIFICE    And still our work must go on. It is the business of men and women  neither to give way to unavailing grief nor to yield to the crushing  incubus of despair, but to find hope that is at the bottom of  everything, even at the bottom of the sea where that glorious virgin of  the ocean is dying.          \"And when she took unto herself a mate            She must espouse the everlasting sea.\"      Even so, for any progress of the race, there must be the ancient  sacrifice of man's own stubborn heart, and all his pride. He must  forever \"lay in dust life's glory dead.\" He cannot rise to the height it  was intended he should reach till he has plumbed the depths, till he has  devoured the bread of the bitterest affliction, till he has known the  ache of hopes deferred, of anxious expectation disappointed, of dreams  that are not to be fulfilled this side of the river that waters the  meads of Paradise. There still must be a reason why it is not an unhappy  thing to be taken from \"the world we know to one a wonder still,\" and so  that we go bravely, what does it matter, the mode of our going? It was  not only those who stood back, who let the women and children go to  the boats, that died. There died among us on the shore something of the  fierce greed of bitterness, something of the sharp hatred of passion,  something of the mad lust of revenge and of knife-edge competition.  Though we are not aware of it, perhaps, we are not quite the people that  we were before out of the mystery an awful hand was laid upon us all,  and what we had thought the colossal power of wealth was in a twinkling  shown to be no more than the strength of an infant's little finger, or  the twining tendril of a plant.              \"Lest we forget; lest we forget!\"    {\"illustration\", really \"music\" Lyrics =    God of mercy and compassion, Look with pity on my pain; Hear a mournful,  broken spirit Prostrate at Thy feet complain; Many are my foes and  mighty; Strength to conquer I have none; Nothing can uphold my goings  But they blessed Self alone.

It is little wonder that  the strain of these moments, with the physical and mental suffering  which followed during the early morning hours, left many of the women  still hysterical when they reached New York.}        WHERE MANHOOD PERISHED NOT     Where cross the lines of forty north       And fifty-fourteen west   There rolls a wild and greedy sea       With death upon its crest.   No stone or wreath from human hands       Will ever mark the spot   Where fifteen hundred men went down,       But Manhood perished not.     Old Ocean takes but little heed       Of human tears or woe.   No shafts adorn the ocean graves,       Nor weeping willows grow.   Nor is there need of marble slab       To keep in mind the spot   Where noble men went down to death,       But manhood perished not!     Those men who looked on death and smiled,       And trod the crumbling deck,   Have saved much more than precious lives       From out that awful wreck.   Though countless joys and hopes and fears       Were shattered at a breath,   'Tis something that the name of Man       Did not go down to death.     'Tis not an easy thing to die,       E'en in the open air,   Twelve hundred miles from home and friends,       In a shroud of black despair.   A wreath to crown the brow of man,       And hide a former blot   Will ever blossom o'er the waves       Where Manhood perished not.                          HARVEY P. THEW             {spelling uncertain due to poor printing}        CHAPTER VIII. THE CALL FOR HELP HEARD    THE VALUE OF THE WIRELESS--OTHER SHIPS ALTER THEIR COURSE--RESCUERS ON  THE WAY    \"WE have struck an iceberg. Badly damaged. Rush aid.\"    Seaward and landward, J. G. Phillips, the Titanic's wireless man, had  hurled the appeal for help. By fits and starts--for the wireless was  working unevenly and blurringly--Phillips reached out to the world,  crying the Titanic's peril. A word or two, scattered phrases, now and  then a connected sentence, made up the message that sent a thrill of  apprehension for a thousand miles east, west and south of the doomed  liner.    The early despatches from St. John's, Cape Race, and Montreal, told  graphic tales of the race to reach the Titanic, the wireless appeals  for help, the interruption of the calls, then what appeared to be a  successful conclusion of the race when the Virginian was reported as  having reached the giant liner.      MANY LINES HEAR THE CALL    Other rushing liners besides the Virginian heard the call and became on  the instant something more than cargo carriers and passenger greyhounds.  The big Baltic, 200 miles to the eastward and westbound, turned again  to save life, as she did when her sister of the White Star fleet, the  Republic, was cut down in a fog in January, 1909. The Titanic's mate,  the Olympic, the mightiest of the seagoers save the Titanic herself,  turned in her tracks. All along the northern lane the miracle of the  wireless worked for the distressed and sinking White Star ship. The  Hamburg-American Cincinnati, the Parisian from Glasgow, the North  German Lloyd Prinz Friedrich Wilhelm, the Hamburg-American liners Prinz  Adelbert and Amerika, all heard the C. Q. D. and the rapid, condensed  explanation of what had happened.      VIRGINIAN IN DESPERATE HASTE    But the Virginian was nearest, barely 170 miles away, and was the first  to know of the Titanic's danger. She went about and headed under  forced draught for the spot indicated in one of the last of Phillips'  messages--latitude 41.46 N. and longitude 50.14 W. She is a fast  ship, the Allan liner, and her wireless has told the story of how she  stretched through the night to get up to the Titanic in time. There was  need for all the power of her engines and all the experience and skill  of her captain. The final fluttering Marconigrams that were released  from the Titanic made it certain that the great ship with 2340 souls  aboard was filling and in desperate peril.    Further out at sea was the Cunarder, Carpathia, which left New York  for the Mediterranean on April 13th. Round she went and plunged back  westward to take a hand in saving life. And the third steamship within  short sailing of the Titanic was the Allan liner Parisian away to the  eastward, on her way from Glasgow to Halifax.    While they sped in the night with all the drive that steam could give  them, the Titanic's call reached to Cape Race and the startled operator  there heard at midnight a message which quickly reached New York:    \"Have struck an iceberg. We are badly damaged. Titanic latitude 41.46  N., 50.14 W.\"    Cape Race threw the appeal broadcast wherever his apparatus could carry.    Then for hours, while the world waited for a crumb of"]]]
