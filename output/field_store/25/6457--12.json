On holding my gun within its reach, it  clasped the barrel with such energy as to bruise the skin of its breast  and legs. After allowing it to partially exhaust itself in these  fruitless huggings, I experimented by letting it seize my hand again,  and I noticed that invariably after each squeeze it made a quick,  violent attempt to free itself. Believing that I had discovered a frog  differing in structure from all known species, and possessing a strange  unique instinct of self-preservation, I carried my captive home,  intending to show it to Dr. Burmeister, the director of the National  Museum at Buenos Ayres-Unfortunately, after I had kept it some days, it  effected its escape by pushing up the glass cover of its box, and I have  never since met with another individual like it. That this singular  frog has it in its power to seriously injure an opponent is, of course,  out of the question; but its unexpected attack must be of great  advantage. The effect of the sudden opening of an umbrella in the face  of an angry bull gives, I think, only a faint idea of the astonishment  and confusion it must cause an adversary by its leap, quick as  lightning, and the violent hug it administers; and in the confusion it  finds time to escape. I cannot for a moment believe that an instinct so  admirable, correlated as it is with the structure of the fore legs, can  be merely an individual variation; and I confidently expect that all I  have said about my lost frog will some day be confirmed by others. Rana  luctator would be a good name for this species.    The toad is a slow-moving creature that puts itself in the way of  persecution; yet, strange to say, the acrid juice it exudes when  irritated is a surer protection to it than venomous fangs are to the  deadliest snake. Toads are, in fact, with a very few exceptions, only  attacked and devoured by snakes, by lizards, and by their own venomous  relative, Ceratophrys ornata. Possibly the cold sluggish natures of all  these creatures protects them against the toad's secretion, which would  be poison to most warm-blooded animals, but I am not so sure that all  fish enjoy a like immunity. I one day noticed a good-sized fish (bagras)  floating, belly upmost, on the water. It had apparently just died, and  had such a glossy, well-nourished look about it, and appeared so full, I  was curious to know the cause of its death. On opening it I found its  stomach quite filled with a very large toad it had swallowed. The toad  looked perfectly fresh, not even a faint discoloration of the skin  showing that the gastric juices had begun to take effect; the fish, in  fact, must have died immediately after swallowing the toad. The country  people in South America believe that the milky secretion exuded by the  toad possesses wonderful curative properties; it is their invariable  specific for shingles--a painful, dangerous malady common amongst them,  and to cure it living toads are applied to the inflamed parb. I dare say  learned physicians would laugh at this cure, but then, if I mistake not,  the learned have in past times laughed at other specifics used by the  vulgar, but which now have honourable places in the  pharmacopoeia--pepsine, for example. More than two centuries ago (very  ancient times for South America) the gauchos were accustomed to take  the lining of the rhea's stomach, dried and powdered, for ailments  caused by impaired digestion; and the remedy is popular still. Science  has gone over to them, and the ostrich-hunter now makes a double profit,  one from the feathers, and the other from the dried stomachs which he  supplies to the chemists of Buenos Ayres. Yet he was formerly told that  to take the stomach of the ostrich to improve his digestion was as wild  an idea as it would be to swallow birds' feathers in order to fly.    I just now called Ceratophrys ornata venomous, though its teeth are not  formed to inject poison into the veins, like serpents' teeth. It is a  singular creature, known as _escuerzo_ in the vernacular, and though  beautiful in colour, is in form hideous beyond description. The skin is  of a rich brilliant green, with chocolate-coloured patches, oval in  form, and symmetrically disposed. The lips are bright yellow, the  cavernous mouth pale flesh colour, the throat and under-surface dull  white. The body is lumpy, and about the size of a large man's fist. The  eyes, placed on the summit of a disproportionately large head, are  embedded in horn-like protuberances, capable of being elevated or  depressed at pleasure. When the creature is undisturbed, the eyes, which  are of a pale gold colour, look out as from a couple of watch towers,  but when touched on the head or menaced, the prominences sink down to a  level with the head, closing the eyes completely, and giving the  creature the appearance of being eyeless. The upper jaw is armed with  minute teeth, and there are two teeth in the centre of the lower jaw,  the remaining portions of the jaw being armed with two exceedingly  sharp-edged bony plates. In place of a tongue, it has a round muscular  process with a rough flat disc the size of a halfpenny.    It is common all over the pampas, ranging as far south as the Rio  Colorado in Patagonia. In the breeding season it congregates in pools,  and one is then struck by their extraordinary vocal powers, which they  exercise by night. The performance in no way resembles the series of  percussive sounds uttered by most batrachians. The notes it utters are  long, as of a wind instrument, not unmelodious, and so powerful as to  make themselves heard distinctly a mile off on still evenings. After the  amorous period these toads retire to moist places and sit inactive,  buried just deep enough to leave the broad green back on a level with  the surface, and it is then very difficult to detect them. In this  position they wait for their prey--frogs, toads, birds, and small  mammals. Often they capture and attempt to swallow things too large for  them, a mistake often made by snakes. In very wet springs they sometimes  come about houses and lie in wait for chickens and ducklings. In  disposition they are most truculent, savagely biting at anything that  comes near them; and when they bite they hang on with the tenacity of a  bulldog, poisoning the blood with their glandular secretions. When  teased, the creature swells itself out to such an extent one almost  expects to see him burst; he follows his tormentors about with slow  awkward leaps, his vast mouth wide open, and uttering an incessant harsh  croaking sound. A gaucho I knew was once bitten by one. He sat down on  the grass, and, dropping his hand at his side, had it seized, and only  freed himself by using his hunting knife to force the creature's mouth  open. He washed and bandaged the wound, and no bad result followed; but  when the toad cannot be shaken off, then the result is different. One  summer two horses were found dead on the plain near my home. One, while  lying down, had been seized by a fold in the skin near the belly; the  other had been grasped by the nose while cropping grass. In both  instances the vicious toad was found dead, with jaws tightly closed,  still hanging to the dead horse. Perhaps they are sometimes incapable of  letting go at will, and like honey bees, destroy themselves in these  savage attacks.          CHAPTER V.    FEAR IN BIRDS.      The statement that birds instinctively fear man is frequently met with  in zoological works written since the _Origin of Species_ appeared; but  almost the only reason--absolutely the only plausible reason, all the  rest being mere supposition--given in support of such a notion is that  birds in desert islands show at first no fear of man, but afterwards,  finding him a dangerous neighbour, they become wild; and their young  also grow up wild. It is thus assumed that the habit acquired by the  former has become hereditary in the latter--or, at all events, that in  time it becomes hereditary. Instincts, which are few in number in any  species, and practically endure for ever, are not, presumably, acquired  with such extraordinary facility.    Birds become shy where persecuted, and the young, even when not  disturbed, learn a shy habit from the parents, and from other adults  they associate with. I have found small birds shyer in desert places,  where the human form was altogether strange to them, than in  thickly-settled districts. Large birds are actually shyer than the small  ones, although, to the civilized or shooting man they seem astonishingly  tame where they have never been fired at. I have frequently walked quite  openly to within twenty-five or thirty yards of a flock of flamingoes  without alarming them. This, however, was when they were in the water,  or on the opposite side of a stream. Having no experience of guns, they  fancied themselves secure as long as a strip of water separated them  from the approaching object. When standing on dry land they would not  allow so near an approach. Sparrows in England aro very much tamer than  the sparrows I have observed in desert places, where they seldom see a  human being. Nevertheless young sparrows in England are very much tamer  than old birds, as anyone may see for himself. During the past summer,  while living near Kew Gardens, I watched the sparrows a great deal, and  fed forty or fifty of them every day from a back window. The bread and  seed was thrown on to a low roof just outside the window, and I noticed  that the young birds when first able to fly were always brought by the  parents to this feeding place, and that after two or three visits they  would begin to come of their own accord. At such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7450"],[0,"Terre Napoleón; a History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia (#13)"],[1,"  first been determined to call the port \"Port du Debut,\"* (* See Appendix  A to this chapter.) is also rather puzzling. \"Du Debut\" of what? The  eastern extremity of the region marked \"Terre Napoleon\" on Freycinet's  charts is Wilson's Promontory, and the real \"Port Du Debut\" of the  territory so designated would be, if there is any relation between words  and things, not Port Phillip but Westernport.* (* In the Moniteur article  of 27th Thermidor, Revolutionary Year 11, Wilson's Promontory is referred  to as the point of departure: \"Il visita d'abord le cap Wilson, d'ou il  prit son point de depart, et s'avanca vers l'ouest en suivant la cote  jusqu'a la distance de 15 degres de longitude.\") Was there some confusion  in Peron's mind as to what port was seen? Unquestionably Le Geographe did  sight Westernport. Was it originally Baudin's intention to ignore Bass's  discovery of 1798, and, giving a French name to every feature of the  coast in Terre Napoleon, to call Westernport \"Port du Debut\"? That would  not have been an appropriate name for Port Phillip had it really been  seen on the morning of March 30, as it most certainly was not. But, it  being determined to denominate the land between Wilson's Promontory and  Cape Adieu \"Terre Napoleon,\" Westernport might well have been counted as  the port of the beginning of the exploration of the territory, and, as  such, it would truly have been the Port du Debut. Freycinet, writing in  1824, acknowledged that Peron, \"having written before the charts were  finished, made some mistakes relative to geography.\"* (* Preface to the  second edition of the Voyage de Decouvertes (1824) 1 page 16.) It is  possible that this was one of his errors; and it would be an easy one for  a man to make who was not familiar with the coast. But assuredly there  was no mere error on Freycinet's part.    What, then, are we to make of the statements of Peron and Freycinet?    The latter officer tells us, in one of his prefaces, that the French  Government was dissatisfied with the work of the expedition, and was at  first disposed to refuse to publish any record of it. Sir Joseph Banks,  closely in touch with movements relative to scientific work, had news of  the displeasure of Napoleon's ministers, and wrote to Flinders, then a  prisoner: \"M. Baudin's voyage has not been published. I do not hear that  his countrymen are well satisfied with his proceedings\" (June 1805).  Finally it was determined to issue a history of the expedition; but to  have published any charts without showing Port Phillip would have been to  make failure look ridiculous. By this time Freycinet, who was preparing  the charts, knew of the existence of the port. The facts drive to the  conclusion that the French had no drawing of Port Phillip of their own  whatever, but that their representation of it was copied from a drawing  of which possession had been acquired--how? It is quite clear that  Freycinet had to patch up the omissions in the work of his companions  from some source, to hide the negligent exploration which had missed one  of the two most important harbours in Australia. We shall hereafter see  how he did it.    APPENDIX A.    The following are the two passages from Peron and Freycinet to which  reference is made in the text. Peron wrote (Voyage de Decouvertes 1 316):  \"Le 30 mars, a la pointe du jour, nous portames sur la terre, que nous  atteignimes bientot. Un grand cap, qui fut appele Cap Richelieu [it is  now Cape Schanck] se projette en avant, et forme l'entree d'une baie  profonde, que nous nommames Baie Talleyrand. Sur la cote orientale de  cette baie, et presque vers son fond, se trouve un port, dont on  distinguoit assez bien les contours du haut des mats; nous le designames  sous le nom de Port du Debut; mais ayant appris dans la suite qu'il avoit  ete reconnu plus en detail par le brick Anglois The Lady Nelson, et qu'il  avoit ete nomme Port Philipp [sic] nous lui conserverons avec d'autant  plus de plaisir ce dernier nom, qu'il rappelle celui du fondateur d'une  colonie dans laquelle nous avons trouve des secours si genereux et si  puissans.\"    Freycinet wrote (Voyage de Decouvertes 3 115): \"Nous venons de vanter la  beaute du port Western; mais celui que l'on rencontre a peu de distance  vers l'O ne paroit pas moins recommandable, tant par son etendue que par  commodite. Nous en avons observe l'entree le 30 mars 1802, sans toutefois  penetrer dans son interieur. Les Anglois, qui l'ont examine avec details,  lui ont donne le nom de Port Phillip en l'honneur du premier gouverneur  de la colonie du Port Jackson...Vers l'interieur on voit de hautes  montagnes; elles se rapprochent du rivage a la hauteur du Cap Suffren; et  de ce point jusqu'au cap Marengo, la cote, plus elevee encore, est d'un  aspect riant et fertile.\"    APPENDIX B.    The reader may find it convenient to have appended also, the passages  from the journals of Murray and Flinders, in which they record their  first view of Port Phillip. These journals were used by Labilliere in  writing his Early History of Victoria (1 78 and 110). Murray's was then  at the Admiralty; it is now in the Public Record Office. That of Flinders  was placed at the disposal of Labilliere by the distinguished grandson of  the explorer, Professor Flinders Petrie, whose great work in revealing to  us moderns an ampler knowledge of the oldest civilisations, those of  Syria and Egypt, is not a little due, one thinks, to capacity inherited  from him who revealed so much of the lands on which the newest of  civilisations, that of Australia, is implanted.    Murray, in the Lady Nelson, sailing close along-shore west from  Westernport on January 5, 1802, saw a headland bearing west-north-west  distant about twelve miles, and an opening in the land that had the  appearance of a harbour north-west ten or twelve miles. When within a  mile and a half, he wrote: \"With closer examination of my own, and going  often to the masthead, I saw that the reef did nearly stretch across the  whole way, but inside saw a fine sheet of smooth water of great extent.  From the wind blowing on this shore, and fresh, I was obliged to haul off  under a press of sail to clear the land, but with a determination to  overhaul it by and by, as no doubt it has a channel into it, and is  apparently a fine harbour of large extent.\" Murray did not enter the port  until after his mate, Bowen, had found the way in, with a boat, in  February.    Flinders, after visiting King Island, resumed his work along the mainland  on April 25. He wrote in his journal: \"Until noon no idea was entertained  of any opening existing in this bight; but at that time an opening became  more and more conspicuous as we ran farther west, and high land at the  back appeared to be at a considerable distance. Still, however, I  entertained but little hopes of finding a passage sufficiently deep for a  ship, and the bearings of the entrance prevented me from thinking it the  west entrance into Westernport.\" In the journal, as in the report to the  Admiralty, and, twelve years later, in his book, Flinders wrote that it  was what Baudin told him that made him think there could be no port in  the neighbourhood. \"From appearances I at first judged this port to be  Westernport, although many others did not answer; though Captain Baudin  had met with no harbour after leaving that, and from his account he had  fine weather and kept the shore close on board to the time of his meeting  us.\"      CHAPTER 4. TERRE NAPOLEON AND ITS NOMENCLATURE.    Imprisonment of Flinders in Mauritius.  The French atlas of 1807.  The French charts and the names upon them.  Hurried publication.  The allegation that Peron acted under pressure.  Freycinet's explanations.  His failure to meet the gravest charge.  Extent of the actual discoveries of Baudin, and nature of the country  discovered.  The French names in current use on the so-called Terre Napoleon coasts.  Difficulty of identifying features to which Baudin applied names.  Freycinet's perplexities.  The new atlas of 1817.    What happened to Matthew Flinders when, after a brief sojourn in Sydney  Harbour, he left to continue his explorations in the northern waters of  Australia, is generally known. While he was at work in the Gulf of  Carpentaria, the condition of the Investigator caused him much  uneasiness, and when she was overhauled, the rotten state of her timbers  compelled him to return. She was then condemned as unseaworthy. On again  sailing north in the Porpoise, he was wrecked on the Barrier Reef. Making  his way back to Sydney in a small open boat built from the wreckage, and  well named the Hope, he was given the use of the Cumberland, a mere barge  of only twenty-nine tons, in which to carry himself and part of his  shipwrecked company to England. Compelled by the leaky condition of the  crazy little craft, and the inefficiency of the pumps, to put into  Mauritius, then a French possession, he was detained as a prisoner by the  French governor, General Decaen, for six and a half years.    There is no need, for our immediate purpose, to linger over these  occurrences, inviting as they are, with a glint of Stevensonian romance  in the bare facts, and all the pathos that attaches to the case of a  brave and blameless man thwarted and ruined by perversity and malignity.  Frequently have the facts been wrongly written, as for instance when  Blair states, in his Cyclopaedia of Australia, that Baudin in Le  Geographe called at Mauritius after Flinders was imprisoned, and, instead  of procuring his release, \"persuaded the Governor to confine him more  rigorously.\" Poor Baudin--he had been in his grave three months when  Flinders appeared at the island in dire distress, and Le Geographe itself  left the day before his arrival.    What is clear, however, is that Flinders was detained in a captivity that  broke down his health and wrecked his useful life, first on General  Decaen's own "]]]
