At the back  of each hut was a hole in the ground used as a latrine, which flies  frequented. Moss was used for toilet paper. Parasitical worms in the  stool were ubiquitous.            Most of the simple people lived in villages of about 20 homes  circling a village green or lining a single winding lane. There were  only first names, and these were usually passed down family lines. To  grind their grain, the villagers used hand mills with crank and gear,  or a communal mill, usually built of oak, driven by power transmitted  through a solid oak shaft, banded with iron as reinforcement, to  internal gear wheels of elm. Almost every village had a watermill. It  might be run by water shooting over or flowing under the wheel.            Clothing for men and women was made from coarse wool, silk, and  linen and was usually brown in color. Only the wealthy could afford to  wear linen or silk. Men also wore leather clothing, such as neckpieces,  breeches, ankle leathers, shoes, and boots. Boots were worn when  fighting. They carried knives or axes under metal belts. They could  carry items by tying leather pouches onto their belts with their  drawstrings. They wore leather gloves for warmth and for heavy working  with their hands.            People were as tall, strong and healthy as in the late 1900s,  not having yet endured the later malnourishment and overcrowding that  was its worst in the 1700s and 1800s. Their teeth were very healthy.  Most adults died in their 40s, after becoming arthritic from hard  labor. People in their 50s were deemed venerable. Boys of twelve were  considered old enough to swear an oath of allegiance to the king. Girls  married in their early teens, often to men significantly older.            The lands of the large landholding lords were administered by  freemen. They had wheat, barley, oats, and rye fields, orchards,  vineyards for wine, and beekeeping areas for honey. On this land lived  not only farm laborers, cattle herders, shepherds, goatherds, and  pigherds, but craftsmen such as goldsmiths, hawkkeepers, dogkeepers,  horsekeepers, huntsmen, foresters, builders, weaponsmiths, embroiders,  bronze smiths, blacksmiths, watermill wrights, wheelwrights, wagon  wrights, iron nail makers, potters, soap makers (made from wood ashes  reacting chemically with fats or oils), tailors, shoemakers, salters  (made salt at the \"wyches\", which later became towns ending with  '-wich'), bakers, cooks, and gardeners. Most men did carpentry work.  Master carpenters worked with ax, hammer, and saw to make houses,  doors, bridges, milk buckets, washtubs, and trunks. Blacksmiths made  gates, huge door hinges, locks, latches, bolts, and horseshoes. The  lord loaned these people land on which to live for their life, called a  \"life estate\", in return for their services. The loan could continue to  their widows or children who took up the craft. Mills were usually  powered by water. Candles were made from beeswax, which exuded a bright  and steady light and pleasant smell, or from mutton fat, which had an  unpleasant odor. The wheeled plough and iron-bladed plough made the  furrows. One man held the plough and another walked with the oxen,  coaxing them forward with a stick and shouts. Seeds were held in an  apron for seeding. Farm implements included spades, shovels, rakes,  hoes, buckets, barrels, flails, and sieves. Plants were pruned to  direct their growth and to increase their yield. Everyone got together  for feasts at key stages of the farming, such as the harvest. Easter  was the biggest feast. When the lord was in the field, his lady held  their estate. There were common lands of these estates as well as of  communities. Any proposed new settler had to be admitted at the court  of this estate.            The land of some lords included fishing villages along the  coasts. From the sea were caught herrings, salmon, porpoises, sturgeon,  oysters, crabs, mussels, cockles, winkles, plaice, flounder, and  lobsters. Sometimes whales were driven into an inlet by many boats.  River fish included eels, pike, minnows, burbot, trout, and lampreys.  They were caught by brushwood weirs, net, bait, hooks, and baskets.  Oysters were so numerous that they were eaten by the poor. The king's  peace extended over the waterways. If mills, fisheries, weirs, or other  structures were set up to block them, they were to be destroyed and a  penalty paid to the king.            Other lords had land with iron mining industries. Ore was dug  from the ground and combined with wood charcoal in a shaft furnace to  be smelted into liquid form. Wood charcoal was derived from controlled  charring of the wood at high temperatures without using oxygen. This  burned impurities from it and left a purer carbon, which burned better  than wood. The pure iron was extracted from this liquid and formed into  bars. To keep the fire hot, the furnaces were frequently placed at  windswept crossings of valleys or on the tops of hills.            Some lords had markets on their land, for which they charged a  toll for participation. There were about fifty markets in the nation.  Cattle and slaves (from the word \"slav\") were the usual medium of  exchange. An ox was still worth about 30d. Shaking hands was symbolic  of an agreement for a sale, which had to be carried out in front of  witnesses at the market for any property worth over 20d. The higher the  value of the property, the more witnesses were required. Witnesses were  also required for the exchange of property and to vouch for cattle  having being born on the property of a person claiming them. People  traveled to markets on deep, sunken roads and narrow bridges kept in  repair by certain men who did this work as their service to the King.  The king's peace extended to a couple of high roads, i.e. highways,  running the length of the country and a couple running its width.            Salt was used throughout the nation to preserve meat over the  winter. Inland saltworks had an elaborate and specialized organization.  The chief one used saltpans and furnaces to extract salt from natural  brine springs. They formed little manufacturing enclaves in the midst  of agricultural land, and they were considered to be neither large  private estates headed by a lord nor appurtenant to such. They belonged  jointly to the king and the local earl, who shared, at a proportion of  two to one, the proceeds of the tolls upon the sale of salt and methods  of carriage on the ancient salt ways according to cartload, horse load,  or man load. Sometimes there were investors in a portion of the works  who lived quite at distance away. The sales of salt were mostly retail,  but some bought to resell. Peddlers carried salt to sell from village  to village.            Some smiths traveled for their work, for instance, stonewrights  building arches and windows in churches, and lead workers putting lead  roofs on churches.            An example of a grant of hides of land is: \"[God has endowed  King Edred with England], wherefore he enriches and honors men, both  ecclesiastic and lay, who can justly deserve it. The truth of this can  be acknowledged by the thegn AElfsige Hunlafing through his acquisition  of the estate of 5 hides at Alwalton for himself and his heirs, free  from every burden except the repair of fortifications, the building of  bridges and military service; a prudent landowner church dues, burial  fees and tithes. [This land] is to be held for all time and granted  along with the things both great and small belonging to it.\"            A Bishop gave land to a faithful attendant for his life and two  other lives as follows: \"In 904 A.D., I, Bishop Werfrith, with the  permission and leave of my honorable community in Worcester, grant to  Wulfsige, my reeve, for his loyal efficiency and humble obedience, one  hide of land at Aston as Herred held it, that is, surrounded by a dyke,  for three lives and then after three lives the estate shall be given  back without any controversy to Worcester.\"            At seaports on the coast, goods were loaded onto vessels owned  by English merchants to be transported to other English seaports.  London was a market town on the north side of the Thames River and the  primary port and trading center for foreign merchants. Streets that  probably date from this time include Milk, Bread, and Wood Streets, and  Honey Lane. There were open air markets such as Billingsgate. There  were wooden quays over much of the river front. Houses were made of  wood, with one sunken floor, or a ground floor with a cellar beneath.  Some had central stone hearths and earth latrines. There were crude  pottery cooking pots, beakers and lamps, wool cloth, a little silk,  simple leather shoes, pewter jewelry, looms, and quernstones (for  grinding flour). Wool, skins, hides, wheat, meal, beer, lead, cheese,  salt, and honey were exported. Wine (mostly for the church), fish,  timber, pitch, pepper, garlic, spices, copper, gems, gold, silk, dyes,  oil, brass, sulphur, glass, slaves, and elephant and walrus ivory were  imported. Goods from the continent were sold at open stalls in certain  streets. Furs and slaves were traded. There was a royal levy on exports  by foreigners merchants. Southwark, across the Thames River from  London,was reachable by a bridge. Southwark contained sleazy docks,  prisons, gaming houses, and brothels.            Guilds in London were first associations of neighbors for the  purposes of mutual assistance. They were fraternities of persons by  voluntary compact to assist each other in poverty, including their  widows or orphans and the portioning of poor maids, and to protect each  other from injury. Their essential features are and continue to be in  the future: 1) oath of initiation, 2) entrance fee in money or in kind  and a common fund, 3) annual feast and mass, 4) meetings at least three  times yearly for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4081"],[0,"The Alchemist (#13)"],[1,"of the seven spheres.
