Almost three months later, on August 5th, the Japanese doctor (Isha)  came to me and said, \"Come with me!\" We walked out in the field to the  sweat boxes, specially to one containing Chaplain Oliver; it was about  three by three by five feet, too small to sit up-too short to lie down  without curling up. Isha seemed to speak English quite well. I was  surprised when he seemed to be rather friendly and told me: \"I like  American music, especially 'Old Black Joe,' and 'Way Down upon the  Suwannee River,'\" adding, \"you must not speak to Col. Oliver. You  examine him, and then tell me the diagnosis and prognosis.\"    I found the chaplain semiconscious with large bruises on the back of  his neck. I told Isha, \"He has a fractured neck. He will die if we  leave him here; he must be taken to the hospital.\" Isha said \"OK! You  take him to hospital!\"    Chaplain Oliver had married Judy and me at the Walter Reed Hospital  Chapel about six years before. We both had great affection for him and  his wife. It was very distressing to see him in this condition. He was  a big man, in spite of many months of starvation; I had an awful time  carrying him back to the hospital. (In spite of his broken neck-caused  by being hit with the butt of a Japanese rifle while being  interrogated regarding the Underground, he survived to return to the  United States and to be honored by the Supreme Council of Scottish  Rite Masons with the esteemed 33rd Degree.) I don't believe that  Chaplain Oliver ever had an active part in the Underground, but he was  suspect because he was senior chaplain in the Philippines.    August 30, 1944: Again, the Japanese Isha came to get me: \"Come with  me! We go to examine Chaplain Taylor, but you must not speak to him!  You tell me diagnosis and prognosis!\"          Being a deacon in his church, I had great respect for him. He  was very weak and obviously quite sick.    \"Doctor Isha, I do not know his diagnosis, but I do know if we leave  him here, he will die! He must be taken to the hospital.\" Isha  replied, \"OK!\"    The next day Bob conveniently coughed up a twenty-inch worm, which I  could show to Isha. He seemed satisfied. I could breathe easier. (Bob  survived, in spite of wounds received on a \"Hell Ship\" to take Judy a  note that I wrote in Japan when I thought I was dying. He later  returned to active duty with the Air Force and eventually became a  major general and Chief of Chaplains.) He also was made a 33rd Degree  Mason.    A third time the Japanese Isha came to get me to go out to the \"sweat  boxes\"-this time to examine Lt. Col. Jack Schwartz, Medical Corps and  Commander of the camp hospital. \"You must not talk to Col. Schwartz!  You make diagnosis! Then you tell me!\" This time I didn't have to talk  to Jack; he was talking to me in medical language. He had assumed the  typical position of    \"acute appendicitis.\" I examined Jack and reported to the Isha: \"Col.  Schwartz has an acute appendicitis! He will die if we don't operate!\"  Again Isha said \"OK! You take him to hospital! You take out appendix  and show me!\"    We took Jack to the hospital and got the operating room ready. Col.  Bill North removed an appendix, which was quite normal. I couldn't  show it to the Isha! Fortunately for me, after viewing Jack's recent  incision, he seemed satisfied. (Col. Schwartz survived to return to  the States, to go back to active duty and eventually become a major  general, and to command Letterman General Hospital in San Francisco.)    Claire Phillips: While the investigation of the underground was  proceeding in the Cabanatuan POW Camp, Claire Phillips (High Pockets)  was picked up by the Military Police in Manila.    She was taken to the old Spanish Fort Santiago, thrown into a dungeon  and then cruelly interrogated by the Kempei Tai (Secret Police) to  make her talk. She was given the water treatment (a hose was put down  her throat, the water turned on-until she was suitably distended, and  then the interrogators jumped on her abdomen until she talked.)    Claire would have probably been executed, but was spared death by the  sudden dropping of the atom bombs, followed by the quick conclusion of  the war.    Cabanatuan Cats (Orchestra): Everything in camp was not always dire;  we had a few lighter moments. Several captives had been successful in  bringing their own musical instruments into camp. In the fall of 1942,  Capt. Lee Stevens, Army Transportation Corps, was able to obtain a  small piano from his home in Manila.    Soon after, Father Bruddenbrook, a Belgian priest, acquired a  miniature piano and several instruments.    P.F.C. (private first class) Johnny Kratz, a clerk on Corregidor,  organized an orchestra, the Cabanatuan Cats. The Japanese enjoyed  music and permitted the orchestra to practice several hours each week  and to give a concert on Wednesday evenings. The orchestra and singers  did much to raise the morale of the camp.    Some of the musicians were from big-name bands. Eddie Booth and Pappy  Harris played pianos; Marshall on the saxophone and clarinet; Lt.  Claire Kuncl (57th Infantry) was tricky on the trombone; Lt. Larry  Parcher and Pvt. Salas played trumpets; Chester McClure and Sgt.  Melvin Reinhart played guitars; Red Kadolph beat the drums; and  Captain Joe Salee sang a beautiful      tenor. Butch Manke, Hank Ruhl, Chuck Kaelin and Louie Baller were  vocal soloists; and Sgt. Becher, Al Roholt, Hank Ruhl and Harry Mock  formed a barbershop quartet called the Four Bees.    When the Cats played \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" you could close your eyes and  imagine Paul Whiteman's complete ensemble performing on the stage-they  were that good. For a few brief moments, the horrors of reality  vanished.    Because of the large number of prisoners from Texas and New Mexico,  \"San Antonio Rose,\" \"The Eyes of Texas,\" and \"The Yellow Rose of  Texas\" always received great applause.    Nearly every ambulatory prisoner placed his blanket out in front of  the stage in the afternoon to reserve a seat for the eight o'clock  performance. As soon as the music began, many Jap guards gathered  around to listen.    Favorite songs were: \"Stardust,\" \"Tennessee Waltz,\" \"A Pretty Girl Is  Like a Melody,\" \"Mood Indigo,\" \"Deep Purple,\" \"Sleepy Lagoon,\"  \"Sentimental Journey,\" \"Fascination,\" \"Tenderly,\" \"Sweet and Lovely,\"  \"In My Solitude,\" and many others. A native song, \"Planting Rice,\" was  popular. And once in a while, they even got away with \"GOD BLESS  AMERICA!\" of course without words.    In October of 1944, the orchestra was ordered to Japan on a prison  ship; the ship was unmarked, and after a few days out, was sunk by an  American submarine. All members of the orchestra were lost!    Stage Shows: The first few months of camp, we had so many captives  transferred to Group IV (the cemetery), that the future seemed very  bleak. To raise the camp morale, Lt. Col. O.O. (Zero) Wilson began a  variety program in Group I; Lt. Bill Burrell started a medicine show  in Group II and Captain Bleich initiated shows in Group III.    In October, 1942, Col. Zero combined the shows into a central casting  office, and every Saturday night put on a super colossal by the  Cabanatuan Mighty Art Players.    Some of the actors were: Al Manning, Robin Swann, a Britisher, Don  Childers, Ben Mossel, Bill Nealson, Robert Brownlee (a Negro and camp  favorite), Bill Burrell, Eddie McIntyre (female impersonator), and  many others.          Some of the fifty-four productions were: Casey Jones, The Drun-  kard, Gone with the Wind, Journey's End, Uncle Tom's Cabin, etc.        Glee Club: Several times, Sgt. Clarence Sayre's Glee Club put    on entertainment in the three groups and in the hospital: \"The  Halleluiah Chorus\" was among all time favorites.    News Reels: On a rare occasion, when the Japs had a big victory to  gloat over, they would show the camp a news reel. The photography was  horrible. They had not yet achieved the American know-how in making  cameras, film, radios, televisions, automobiles, computers, etc.    Library: Some two hundred books were collected from the barracks in  Group II. Records were kept on the back of labels off condensed milk  cans. Other groups started collecting books and the number reached  nine hundred including magazines.    In November, 1942, a camp library was started by Lt. Col. Babcock,  assisted by Capt. Brunette and Lts. Trifilo and Edwards. Prisoner  details were sometimes able to obtain books or magazines on their  journeys.    Classes: Captives were forbidden to gather in groups without special  permission. Classes were formed in many subjects: Japanese, German,  Spanish, Russian, and Tagalog (native Philippine language). There were  classes in astrology, banking, photography, history, cheese and wine  making, menus, diets, etc. One prisoner, almost blind, wrote a  cookbook.    Games: Many games were played during off-duty hours: cribbage,  acey-ducey (U.S. Navy), chess, checkers, bridge, poker, and the like.  At times baseball and volleyball were attempted, but beriberi  definitely limited any enthusiasm and the games died out.    Soochow, a Chinese bulldog and Marine mascot, gave much pleasure to  many prisoners-he thought he was an officer.    Masons: In August, 1943, two Masons, Chap. John Borneman and Major  Howard Cavender (former manager of the Manila Hotel), were  instrumental in getting money, medicine and food from Masons in Manila  through the underground and donating it to prisoners.    In a camp where competition for survival was becoming a serious  problem, where officer was stealing from officer, it was a real joy to  see the brotherly love of Masons for their fellow men. I decided that  someday I would be a Mason.    The Morgue: It was only a short distance from Zero Ward to the morgue,  where bodies were accumulated, awaiting the daily trip to the  cemetery.    The Cemetery (Group IV): Once each day, thirty to fifty    captives formed lines at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8452"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 363, December 16, 1882 (#13)"],[1," stations--two points of the coast, for example--by two different  observers. The sighting is done with two telescopes, A1 and A2, which  the observers revolve around a vertical axis by means of two winches, K1  and K2, that gear with two trains of clockwork. There is thus constantly  formed a large triangle, having for its apices the movable point sighted  and the vertical axes, A1 and A2, of the two telescopes. On another  hand, at a point situated between the two telescopes, there is a table,  T T, that carries two alidades, a1v1, and a2v2, movable around their  vertical axes, a1 and a2. The line, a1 a2, that joins these axes is  parallel with that which joins the axes of the two telescopes; and the  alidades are connected electrically with the telescopes by a system  such that each alidade always moves parallel with the telescope that  corresponds to it. It follows from this that the small triangle that  has for apices, a1 a2, and the crossing point of the two alidades will  always be like the large triangle formed by the line that joins the  telescopes and the two lines of vision. If, then, we know the ratio of  a1, a2 to A1 A2, it will suffice to measure on one of the alidades the  distance from its axis to the point of crossing in order to know the  distance from the movable object to the axis of the corresponding  telescope. If the table, T T, be covered with a chart giving the space  over which the ship is moving, so that a1 and a2 shall coincide with the  points which A1 and A2 represent, the crossing of the threads of the  alidades will permit of following on the chart all the ship's movements.  In this way there maybe had a powerful auxiliary in coast defence; for  all the points at which torpedoes have been sunk may be marked on the  chart, and, as soon as the operator at the table finds, by the motion  of the alidades, that the ship under observation is directly over a  torpedo, he will be able to fire the latter and blow the enemy up.  During this time the two observers at A1 and A2 have only to keep their  telescopes directed upon the vessel that it has been agreed upon to  watch.    [Illustration: SIEMENS' ELECTRIC TELEMETER]    In order to obtain a parallelism between the motion of the alidades and  that of the corresponding telescopes, the winch of each of the latter,  while putting its instrument in motion, also sets in motion a Siemens  double-T armature electromagnetic machine. One of the wires of the  armature of this machine, connected to the frame, is always in  communication with the ground at E1 (if we consider, for example, the  telescope to the left), and the other ends in a spring that alternately  touches two contacts. One of these contacts communicates with the  wire, L1 and the other with the wire, L3, so that, when the machine is  revolving, the currents are sent alternately into L1 and L3. These two  latter wires end in a system of electro magnets, M1, provided with a  polarized armature. The motions of the latter act, through an anchor  escapement, upon a system of wheels. An axle, set in motion by the  latter, revolves one way or the other, according to the direction of the  telescope's motions. This axle is provided with an endless screw that  gears with a toothed sector, and the latter controls the rotatory axis  of the alidade. The elements of the toothed wheels and the number of  revolutions of the armature for a given displacement of the telescope  being properly calculated, it will be seen that the alidade will be able  to follow all the movements of the latter.    When it is desired to place one of the telescopes in a given position  (its position of zero, for example), without acting on the alidade,  it may be done by acting directly on the telescope itself without the  intermedium of the winch. For such purpose it is necessary to interrupt  communication with the mechanism by pressing on the button, q. If the  telescope be turned to one side or the other of its normal position,  in making it describe an angle of 90 deg., it will abut against stops, and  these two positions will permit of determining the direction of the  base.    The alidades themselves are provided with a button which disengages the  toothed sector from the endless screw, and permits of their being  turned to a mark made on the table. A regulating screw permits of this  operation being performed very accurately. In what precedes, we have  supposed a case in which the movable point is viewed by two observers,  and in which the table, T T, is stationed at a place distant from them.  In certain cases only two stations are employed. One of the telescopes  is then placed over its alidade and moves with it; and the apparatus  thus comprehends only a system of synchronous movements.    This telemeter was one of the first that was tried in our military  ports, and gave therein most satisfactory results. The maneuver of the  winch, however, requires a certain amount of stress, and in order that  the sending of the currents shall be regular, the operator must turn it  very uniformly. This is a slight difficulty that has led to the use  of piles, instead of the magneto-electric machine, in the apparatus  employed in France. With such substitution there is need of nothing more  than a movable contact that requires no exertion, and that may be guided  by the telescope itself.--_La Lumiere Electrique_.           *       *       *       *       *          PHYSICS WITHOUT APPARATUS.      _Experiment in Static Electricity_.--Take a pipe--a common clay one  costing one cent--and balance it carefully on the edge of a goblet, so  that it will oscillate freely at the least touch, like the beam of a  scales. This being done, say to your audience: \"Here is a pipe placed  on the edge of a goblet; now the question is to make it fall without  touching it, without blowing against it, without touching the glass,  without agitating the air with a fan, and without moving the supporting  table\"    [Illustration: CLAY PIPE ATTRACTED BY AN ELECTRIFIED GOBLET.]    The problem thus proposed may be solved by means of electricity. Take a  goblet like the one that supports the pipe, and rub it briskly against  your coat sleeve, so as to electrify the glass through friction. Having  done this, bring the goblet to within about a centimeter of the pipe  stem. The latter will then be seen to be strongly attracted, and will  follow the glass around and finally fall from its support.    This curious experiment is a pretty variation of the electric pendulum;  and it shows that pipe-clay--a very bad conductor of electricity--favors  very well the attraction of an electrified body.    Tumblers or goblets are to be found in every house, and a clay pipe  is easily procured anywhere. So it would be difficult to produce  manifestations of electricity more easily and at less expense than by  the means here described.--_La Nature_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE CASCADE BATTERY.    [Footnote: Lately read before the Society of Telegraph Engineers and  Electricians.]    By F. HIGGINS.      The battery which I have brought here to-night to introduce to your  notice is of the circulating kind, in which the alimentary fluid  employed passes from cell to cell by gravitation, and maintains the  action of the battery as long as it continues to flow. It cannot,  of course, compare with such abundant sources of electricity as  dynamo-electric machines driven by steam power, but for purposes in  which a current of somewhat greater volume and constancy than that  furnished by the ordinary voltaic batteries is required, it will, I  believe, be found in some cases useful. A single fluid is employed, and  each cell is provided with an overflow spout.    The cells are arranged upon steps, in order that the liquid may flow  from the cell on the topmost step through each successive cell by  gravitation [specimen cells were on the table before the audience] to  the reservoir at the bottom. The top and the bottom reservoirs are of  equal capacity, and are fitted with taps. The topmost tap is used to  regulate the flow of the solution, and the bottom one to draw it off. In  each cell two carbon plates are suspended above a quantity of fragments  of amalgamated zinc. The following is a sectional drawing of the  arrangement of the cell:    [Illustration]    A copper wire passes down to the bottom of the cell and makes connection  with the mercury; this wire is covered with gutta-percha, except where  immersed in the mercury. The pores of the carbon plates are filled  with paraffin wax. This battery was first employed for the purpose of  utilizing waste solution from bichromate batteries, a great quantity of  which is thrown away before having been completely exhausted. This waste  is unavoidable, in consequence of the impossibility of permitting such  batteries, when employed for telegraphic purposes, to run until complete  exhaustion or reduction of the solutions has been effected; therefore  some valuable chemicals have to be sacrificed to insure constancy in  working. The fragments of zinc in this cell were also the remains of  amalgamated zinc plates from the bichromate batteries, and the mercury  which is employed for securing good metallic connection is soon  augmented by that remaining after the dissolution of the zinc. It will  therefore be seen that not only the solution, but also the zinc and  mercury remnants of bichromate batteries are utilized, and at the same  time a considerable quantity of electricity is generated. The cells are  seven inches deep and six inches wide, outside, and contain about a  quart of solution in addition to the plates. The battery which I employ  regularly, consisting of 18 cells, is at present working nine permanent  current Morse circuits, which previously required 250 telegraphic  Daniell cells to produce the same effect, and is capable of working at  least ten times the number of circuits which I have"]]]
