As to those who, to disguise their fears, talk of the  difficulty of the roads and the want of food, he finds it very insolent  in them to suppose that their general will forget his duty, or to  pretend to dictate it to him. The care of the war is his business: the  Sequani, the Leuci, and the Lingones will furnish wheat; in fact, it is  already ripe in the fields (_jamque esse in agris frumenta matura_). As  to the roads, they will soon have the opportunity of judging of them  themselves. He is told the soldiers will not obey, or raise the ensigns  (_signa laturi_).[216] Words like these would not shake him; the soldier  despises the voice of his chief only when the latter is, by his own  fault, abandoned by fortune or convicted of cupidity or embezzlement. As  to himself, his whole life proves his integrity; the war of the Helvetii  affords evidence of his favour with fortune; for which cause, without  delay, he will break up the camp to-morrow morning, for he is impatient  to know if, among his soldiers, fear will prevail over honour and duty.  If the army should refuse to follow him, he will start alone, with the  10th legion, of which he will make his praetorian cohort. Caesar had  always loved this legion, and, on account of its valor, had always the  greatest confidence in it.    This language, in which, without having recourse to the rigours of  discipline, Caesar appealed to the honour of his soldiers, exciting at  the same time the emulation both of those whom he loaded with praise  and of those whose services he affected to disdain,--this proud  assertion of his right to command produced a wonderful revolution in the  minds of the men, and inspired the troops with great ardour for  fighting. The 10th legion first charged its tribunes to thank him for  the good opinion he had expressed towards them, and declared that they  were ready to march. The other legions then sent their excuses by their  tribunes and centurions of the first class, denied their hesitations and  fears, and pretended that they had never given any judgment upon the  war, as that appertained only to the general.[217]      [Sidenote: March towards the Valley of the Rhine.]    V. This agitation having been calmed, Caesar sought information  concerning the roads from Divitiacus, who, of all the Gauls, inspired  him with the greatest amount of confidence. In order to proceed from  Besancon to the valley of the Rhine, to meet Ariovistus, the Roman army  had to cross the northern part of the Jura chain. This country is  composed of two very distinct parts. The first comprises the valley of  the Doubs from Besancon to Montbeliard, the valley of the Oignon, and  the intermediate country, a mountainous district, broken, much covered  with wood, and, without doubt, at the time of Caesar's war in Gaul, more  difficult than at present. The other part, which begins at the bold  elbow made by the Doubs near Montbeliard, is composed of lengthened  undulations, which diminish gradually, until they are lost in the plains  of the Rhine. It is much less wooded than the first, and offers easier  communications. (_See Plate 4._)    Caesar, as he had announced, started early on the morrow of the day on  which he had thus addressed his officers, and, determined on conducting  his army through an open country, he turned the mountainous and  difficult region just described, thus making a circuit of more than  fifty miles (seventy-five kilometres),[218] which is represented by a  semi-circumference, the diameter of which would be the line drawn from  Besancon to Arcey. It follows the present road from Besancon to Vesoul  as far as Pennesieres, and continues by Vallerois-le-Bois and  Villersexel to Arcey. He could perform this distance in four days; then  he resumed, on leaving Arcey, the direct road from Besancon to the Rhine  by Belfort and Cernay.    On the seventh day of a march uninterrupted since leaving Besancon, he  learnt by his scouts that the troops of Ariovistus were at a distance of  not more than twenty-four miles (36 kilometres).    Supposing 20 kilometres for the day's march, the Roman army would have  travelled over 140 kilometres in seven days, and would have arrived on  the Thur, near Cernay. (By the road indicated, the distance from  Besancon to the Thur is about 140 kilometres.) At this moment,  Ariovistus would have been encamped at 36 kilometres from the Romans, to  the north, near Colmar.    Informed of the arrival of Caesar, Ariovistus sent him word \"that he  consented to an interview, now that the Roman general had come near, and  that there was no longer any danger for him in going to him.\" Caesar did  not reject this overture, supposing that Ariovistus had returned to more  reasonable sentiments.    The interview was fixed for the fifth day following.[219] In the  interval, while there was a frequent exchange of messages, Ariovistus,  who feared some ambuscade, stipulated, as an express condition, that  Caesar should bring with him no foot soldiers, but that, on both sides,  they should confine themselves to an escort of cavalry. The latter,  unwilling to furnish any pretext for a rupture, consented; but, not  daring to entrust his personal safety to the Gaulish cavalry, he mounted  on their horses men of the 10th legion, which gave rise to this jocular  saying of one of the soldiers: \"Caesar goes beyond his promise; he was to  make us praetorians, and he makes us knights.\"[220]      [Sidenote: Interview between Caesar and Ariovistus.]    VI. Between the two armies extended a vast plain, that which is crossed  by the Ill and the Thur. A tolerably large knoll rose in it at a nearly  equal distance from either camp.[221] This was the place of meeting of  the two chieftains. Caesar posted his mounted legion at 200 paces from  the knoll, and the cavalry of Ariovistus stood at the same distance. The  latter demanded that the interview should take place on horseback, and  that each of the two chiefs should be accompanied only by ten horsemen.  When they met, Caesar reminded Ariovistus of his favours, of those of the  Senate, of the interest which the Republic felt in the AEdui, of that  constant policy of the Roman people which, far from suffering the  abasement of its allies, sought incessantly their elevation. He repeated  his first conditions.    Ariovistus, instead of accepting them, put forward his own claims: \"He  had only crossed the Rhine at the prayer of the Gauls; the lands which  he was accused of having seized, had been ceded to him; he had  subsequently been attacked, and had scattered his enemies; if he has  sought the friendship of the Roman people, it is in the hope of  benefiting by it; if it becomes prejudicial to him, he renounces it; if  he has carried so many Germans into Gaul, it is for his personal safety;  the part he occupies belongs to him, as that occupied by the Romans  belongs to them; his rights of conquest are older than those of the  Roman army, which had never passed the limits of the province. Caesar is  only in Gaul to ruin it. If he does not withdraw from it, he will regard  him as an enemy, and he is certain that by his death he shall gain the  gratitude of a great number of the first and most illustrious personages  in Rome. They have informed him by their messengers that, at this price,  he would gain their good-will and friendship. But if he be left in free  possession of Gaul, he will assist in all the wars that Caesar may  undertake.\"    Caesar insisted on the arguments he had already advanced: \"It was not one  of the principles of the Republic to abandon its allies; he did not  consider that Gaul belonged to Ariovistus any more than to the Roman  people. When formerly Q. Fabius Maximus vanquished the Arverni and the  Ruteni, Rome pardoned them, and neither reduced them to provinces nor  imposed tribute upon them. If, then, priority of conquest be invoked,  the claims of the Romans to the empire of Gaul are the most just; and if  it be thought preferable to refer to the Senate, Gaul ought to be free,  since, after victory, the Senate had willed that she should preserve her  own laws.\"    During this conversation, information was brought to Caesar that the  cavalry of Ariovistus were approaching the knoll, and were throwing  stones and darts at the Romans. Caesar immediately broke up the  conference, withdrew to his escort, and forbade them to return the  attack, not from fear of an engagement with his favourite legion, but in  order to avoid, in case he should defeat his enemies, the suspicion that  he might have taken advantage of their good faith to surprise them in an  interview. Nevertheless, the arrogance of Ariovistus, the disloyal  attack of his cavalry, and the rupture of the conference, were soon  known, and excited the ardour and impatience of the Roman troops.    Two days afterwards, Ariovistus made a proposal for a renewal of the  conference, or for the sending to him of one of Caesar's lieutenants.  Caesar refused, the more so because, the day before, the Germans had  again advanced and thrown their missiles at the Romans, and that thus  his lieutenant would not have been safe from the attacks of the  barbarians. He thought it more prudent to send as his deputy Valerius  Procillus, the son of a Gaul who had become a Roman citizen, who spoke  the Celtic language, and who was on familiar terms with Ariovistus, and  M. Mettius, with whom the German king was bound by the rights of  hospitality. They had hardly entered the camp of Ariovistus, when he  ordered them to be thrown into fetters, under pretence that they were  spies.[222]      [Sidenote: Movements of the two Armies.]    VII. The same day, the German king broke up his camp and took another  position at the foot of the Vosges (_sub monte_), at a distance of 6,000  paces from that of Caesar, between Soultz and Feldkirch, not far from the  Lauch.

To the Y.M.C.A., then, let our energies be dedicated! For they are  a coming factor in the scheme of things, and individual enterprise,  gratifying and profitable though it may be to the individual, is hardly  _pro bono publico_.      _January 15th._ There are hours when one would love a little  solitude--the solitude that is, after all, as necessary for well-being  as food and rest; hours when the time to digest and sift the manifold  occurrences of the day, the presence of a congenial friend to replace  the many acquaintances with whom circumstances have herded us together,  and a browse over a favourite poet, would be very welcome. Yet, in  truth, poetry no longer matters, art no longer matters, music no longer  matters to most of us; nothing _really_ matters save life and death  and the end of this carnage. Nor will the old regime, the old art, the  old literature ever again satisfy those who have seen red and faced  life shorn of its trappings of superficiality and conventions. Yet in  spite of the fact that all around us we see butchery and the degrading  results of Germany's peculiar _kultur_, in spite of the fact that the  spiritual side of life has been--is still--so utterly dormant as to be  almost a thing of another existence, on the whole an attitude of great  enthusiasm and gratitude prevails for the privilege of being able to  work.      _January 18th._ My first glimpse at a canteen!     [Illustration: THE FIRST HUT AT THE BASE]    Let me describe the scene as we entered to find a long queue of  shivering Tommies waiting. The long \"hut,\" at the end of which, on a  platform, the piano tinkles incessantly, seemed smaller by reason of  the many chairs and forms.    The counter, on the clearing of which our attention was turned first,  like the tables, is covered with red-and-white check oilcloth, which  facilitates the swabbing up of the ever crowded place.    Behind the counter are tables, on which, in between serving the men, we  busy ourselves with the preparation of cocoa, the cutting up of cakes  and bread, an occupation which I discover to be as much a science as an  art.    In the little kitchen the great struggle is to get water boiling in  time, and to keep it boiling, in response to the demand. The difficulty  at the counter is to keep tea and coffee hot without letting them stew.  At one end we take it in turns to take money and to dole out tickets,  which are exchanged for goods at the counter. The advantages of the  ticket system are mostly noticeable during a \"rush,\" when it diverts  the stream of men and obviates the necessity of serving food with  coin-soiled hands.    One must, it seems, keep as little as possible on the counter, for fear  of tempting Providence and the impecunious! But a wonderful medley of  tobacco, soap, bootlaces, chocolate, etc., is displayed on shelves at  the back.    Here the men can write home on paper supplied free by the Y.M.C.A. (A  big notice on the wall reminds them to \"Write home now.\") They can read  (a small library, which my fingers are itching to catalogue, lies at  the end of the building); they can bank here, and play games, and get  advice on all problems, mental and moral.    The value of the work can best be estimated by the men's appreciation  of it in their letters home, their continual inquiries after similar  institutions \"up the line,\" their sorrow when they hear: \"No, we're not  up there yet--but shall be soon.\"    The workers consist of Y.M.C.A. secretaries, mostly Nonconformist  ministers, and volunteer ladies who wander on duty when the spirit  moves them, which sometimes necessitates one shift going without its  meals.    A pleasant little music teacher, who is spending her holiday out here,  and is useful for organising concerts, accompanying the men, etc.,  initiated me into the work. The rest of the \"staff\" consists of a  French girl, to cook the secretaries' meals, and a half-witted man,  supposed to tend the fires, help with the washing up, etc., but who is  invariably inspired to play hymns just when most needed.      _January 25th._ A naval battle off the Dogger Bank is reported,  which reminds me of the letters I receive from a naval friend, whose  life on board the ---- is spent patrolling the North Sea and longing  for action. How different from the fighting friends one runs into  occasionally! The other day I came across one who was down with a  touch of tonsilitis, having passed through Mons and every big battle  that succeeded it unscathed. \"I shouldn't at all mind going home with  a smashed arm!\" he remarked with an almost involuntary sigh, gazing  wistfully at the hospital ship as she sailed majestically out of  harbour, her gleaming red cross casting weird lights on the dark water.      _January 28th._ There are times when one is unkind enough to wish one's  co-workers the discipline of three months as junior probationer in a  large hospital. Last night I arrived to find myself the only worker,  and although I enjoyed the rush right enough, it was impossible to get  things done to time, and many of the men had to go away unserved.    The methylated spirit ran out, and so demobilised the services of the  Primus stoves. The secretary had a bad headache, and was therefore only  able to sit at the till, and the odd man was inspired to make night  hideous with his discordant hymns, and, having had a tiff with one of  the ladies earlier in the day, refused to do a stroke of work. It was  a particularly busy night, never less than a hundred men in the hut, I  should say, and ten o'clock found me still washing up cups with the aid  of a little chauffeur whose vehicle had gone wrong! _Faute de mieux_ he  accompanied me along the roughest part of the quay, where one is apt to  be molested by the drunken navvies who reel about at night.      _January 30th._ Wish hard enough and it shall be given unto you!  Yesterday was a day of joy, for in it I found a real girl friend of my  own age and kind.    She appeared on the scene one morning like a breath of fresh air, this  young American.    \"What are _you_ doing over here?\" I asked. \"Come to see the war?\"    \"Guess you're about right,\" she replied, with an accent you could cut  with a knife. \"Nothing else would have dragged me away from God's own  country!\"      _January 31st._ The old order changeth--even in Boulogne! In less than  a week the Red Cross will be installed at the C----, where once was the  Allied Forces Base Hospital. In less than a week all Red Cross cars  come under direct supervision of the A.S.C.    To-day the Red Cross sisters at the Gare Maritime (No. ---- Stationary  Hospital) have received their _conge_, even those \"original six\" who  built it up, being superseded by Army nurses.    Most of the nurses I know have dispersed, many to St. Omer, where in  a big monastery hospital they are stamping out enteric amongst the  civilian population in order to safeguard our men. Miss A---- has gone  to L----, where, from Dr. Le Page's hospital, she writes of wonderful  surgical work.    I too would be glad of a new sphere of action, for I am lost in  amazement at the sea of petty jealousies. Where is the unity of purpose  that bound us all together in the beginning? Is disunion the outcome  of overwrought nerves? Even at the hut discord reigns.    The lady in charge dislikes both the music teacher and the American  girl, who in turn live at daggers drawn with the respective people of  their respective parties and are envious of each other. And yet they  one and all are extremely nice folk. One must attribute it to some  especially puissant sprite and to Pandora's carelessness!          CHAPTER V    February, 1915      _February 2nd._ This morning, in company with our chief, Mr. H----,  I went over to prospect in the new sphere of action. The lower part  of the hotel that the Association has taken is devoted to a canteen,  whilst on the first floor there is a library and writing-room, and  above, seven spacious rooms lie empty until such a time as the hostel  is started. The hostel is a grand scheme for billeting gratis the  relatives of badly wounded men, who could otherwise not afford the  journey.    My heart sank at sight of the minute kitchen, the range of which seemed  literally hidden by pots and pans; but no doubt one day we shall get it  in order.    The secretary--a Scottish padre--is full of enthusiasm for football,  with which he hopes to keep the men at the base well amused.    In the afternoon, on exploring for myself, I discovered that the most  interesting feature of the place is the isolation compound that  lies alongside the enteric hospital. Here all infectious illnesses  are treated in bathing-boxes rigged out as wards; here are patients  indulging in every conceivable disease, from mumps and measles to  diphtheria, typhoid and the dreaded spinal meningitis.    Farther along, attached to the Casino, whose spacious gaming rooms make  wonderfully cheerful wards, is a smaller hotel, where the men suffering  from skin diseases are treated. One's heart goes out to these men,  especially the wounded ones, who through no fault of their own are  afflicted with the foul diseases that follow in the train of war.    The main road is lined with hospitals--the \"British,\" the  \"Anglo-American,\" the \"Rawal Pindi\" (so called because the unit was  mobilised in that far-away Indian station), and others.    The great objection to the converted hotels is the smallness of  the well-appointed rooms, which gives one the desire to knock down  intervening walls and form them into one spacious room to save the  sisters' feet and the patients' voices!    One is lost in admiration now at the organisation of things, just as  two months ago one was appalled by the state of unreadiness. Nothing  that can be done for our men is omitted.      _February 3rd._ For the last time I watch the moon wane, the sun rise  over the mist-bathed"]]]
