[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4362"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan, General, United States Army â€” Complete (#13)"],[1,"brought with me over the mountains a few head of beef cattle  for the hungry Indians, without thinking of running any great  personal risk I had six beeves killed some little distance from my  camp, guarding the meat with four Soldiers, whom I was obliged to  post as sentinels around the small area on which the carcasses lay.  The Indians soon formed a circle about the sentinels, and impelled by  starvation, attempted to take the beef before it could be equally  divided.  This was of course resisted, when they drew their knives  --their guns having been previously taken away from them--and some of  the inferior chiefs gave the signal to attack.  The principal chief,  Tetootney John, and two other Indians joined me in the centre of the  circle, and protesting that they would die rather than that the  frenzied onslaught should succeed, harangued the Indians until the  rest of the company hastened up from camp and put an end to the  disturbance.  I always felt grateful to Tetootney John for his  loyalty on this occasion, and many times afterward aided his family  with a little coffee and sugar, but necessarily surreptitiously, so  as not to heighten the prejudices that his friendly act had aroused  among his Indian comrades.    The situation at Yaquina Bay did not seem very safe, notwithstanding  the supply of beef we brought; and the possibility that the starving  Indians might break out was ever present, so to anticipate any  further revolt, I called for more troops.  The request was complied  with by sending to my assistance the greater part of my own company  (\"K\")from Fort Yamhill.  The men, inspired by the urgency of our  situation, marched more than forty miles a day, accomplishing the  whole distance in so short a period, that I doubt if the record has  ever been beaten.  When this reinforcement arrived, the Indians saw  the futility of further demonstrations against their agent, who they  seemed to think was responsible for the insufficiency of food, and  managed to exist with the slender rations we could spare and such  indifferent food as they could pick up, until the Indian Department  succeeded in getting up its regular supplies.  In the past the poor  things had often been pinched by hunger and neglect, and at times  their only food was rock oysters, clams and crabs.  Great quantities  of these shell-fish could be gathered in the bay near at hand, but  the mountain Indians, who had heretofore lived on the flesh of  mammal, did not take kindly to mollusks, and, indeed, ate the  shell-fish only as a last resort.    Crab catching at night on the Yaquina Bay by the coast Indians was a  very picturesque scene.  It was mostly done by the squaws and  children, each equipped with a torch in one hand, and a sharp-pointed  stick in the other to take and lift the fish into baskets slung on  the back to receive them.  I have seen at times hundreds of squaws  and children wading about in Yaquina Bay taking crabs in this manner,  and the reflection by the water of the light from the many torches,  with the movements of the Indians while at work, formed a weird and  diverting picture of which we were never tired.    Not long after the arrival of the additional troops from Yamhill, it  became apparent that the number of men at Yaquina Bay would have to  be reduced, so in view of this necessity, it was deemed advisable to  build a block-house for the better protection of the agents and I  looked about for suitable ground on which to erect it.  Nearly all  around the bay the land rose up from the beach very abruptly, and the  only good site that could be found was some level ground used as the  burial-place of the Yaquina Bay Indians--a small band of fish-eating  people who had lived near this point on the coast for ages.  They  were a robust lot, of tall and well-shaped figures, and were called  in the Chinook tongue \"salt chuck,\" which means fish-eaters, or  eaters of food from the salt water.  Many of the young men and women  were handsome in feature below the forehead, having fine eyes,  aquiline noses and good mouths, but, in conformity with a  long-standing custom, all had flat heads, which gave them a distorted  and hideous appearance, particularly some of the women, who went to  the extreme of fashion and flattened the head to the rear in a sharp  horizontal ridge by confining it between two boards, one running back  from the forehead at an angle of about forty degrees, and the other up  perpendicularly from the back of the neck.  When a head had been  shaped artistically the dusky maiden owner was marked as a belle, and  one could become reconciled to it after a time, but when carelessness  and neglect had governed in the adjustment of the boards, there  probably was nothing in the form of a human being on the face of the  earth that appeared so ugly.    It was the mortuary ground of these Indians that occupied the only  level spot we could get for the block-house.  Their dead were buried  in canoes, which rested in the crotches of forked sticks a few feet  above-ground.  The graveyard was not large, containing probably from  forty to fifty canoes in a fair state of preservation.  According to  the custom of all Indian tribes on the Pacific coast, when one of  their number died all his worldly effects were buried with him, so  that the canoes were filled with old clothes, blankets, pieces of  calico and the like, intended for the use of the departed in the  happy hunting grounds.    I made known to the Indians that we would have to take this piece of  ground for the blockhouse.  They demurred at first, for there is  nothing more painful to an Indian than disturbing his dead, but they  finally consented to hold a council next day on the beach, and thus  come to some definite conclusion.  Next morning they all assembled,  and we talked in the Chinook language all day long, until at last  they gave in, consenting, probably, as much because they could not  help themselves, as for any other reason.  It was agreed that on the  following day at 12 o'clock, when the tide was going out, I should  take my men and place the canoes in the bay, and let them float out  on the tide across the ocean to the happy hunting-grounds:    At that day there existed in Oregon in vast numbers a species of  wood-rat, and our inspection of the graveyard showed that the canoes  were thickly infested with them.  They were a light gray animal,  larger than the common gray squirrel, with beautiful bushy tails,  which made them strikingly resemble the squirrel, but in cunning and  deviltry they were much ahead of that quick-witted rodent.  I have  known them to empty in one night a keg of spikes in the storehouse in  Yamhill, distributing them along the stringers of the building, with  apparently no other purpose than amusement.  We anticipated great fun  watching the efforts of these rats to escape the next day when the  canoes should be launched on the ocean, and I therefore forbade any  of the command to visit the graveyard in the interim, lest the rats  should be alarmed.  I well knew that they would not be disturbed by  the Indians, who held the sacred spot in awe.  When the work of  taking down the canoes and carrying them to the water began,  expectation was on tiptoe, but, strange as it may seem, not a rat was  to be seen.  This unexpected development was mystifying.  They had  all disappeared; there was not one in any of the canoes, as  investigation proved, for disappointment instigated a most thorough  search.  The Indians said the rats understood Chinook, and that as  they had no wish to accompany the dead across the ocean to the happy  hunting-grounds, they took to the woods for safety.  However that may  be, I have no doubt that the preceding visits to the burial-ground,  and our long talk of the day before, with the unusual stir and  bustle, had so alarmed the rats that, impelled, by their suspicious  instincts, they fled a danger, the nature of which they could not  anticipate, but which they felt to be none the less real and  impending.

The troubles at the Siletz and Yaquina Bay were settled without  further excitement by the arrival in due time of plenty of food, and  as the buildings, at Fort Haskins were so near completion that my  services as quartermaster were no longer needed, I was ordered to  join my own company at Fort Yamhill, where Captain Russell was still  in command.  I returned to that place in May, 1857, and at a period a  little later, in consequence of the close of hostilities in southern  Oregon, the Klamaths and Modocs were sent back to their own country,  to that section in which occurred, in 1873, the disastrous war with  the latter tribe.  This reduced considerably the number of Indians at  the Grande Ronde, but as those remaining were still somewhat unruly,  from the fact that many questions requiring adjustment were  constantly arising between the different bands, the agent and the  officers at the post were kept pretty well occupied.  Captain Russell  assigned to me the special work of keeping up the police control, and  as I had learned at an early day to speak Chinook (the \"court  language\" among the coast tribes) almost as well as the Indians  themselves, I was thereby enabled to steer my way successfully on  many critical occasions.    For some time the most disturbing and most troublesome element we had  was the Rogue River band.  For three or four years they had fought  our troops obstinately, and surrendered at the bitter end in the  belief that they were merely overpowered, not conquered.  They openly  boasted to the other Indians that they could whip the soldiers, and  that they did not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#13)"],[1," power and delight in  self-control are on the increase. To them religion offers sufficient  incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to  experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and  of solitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of  educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary  baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. And finally, to  ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and  general utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives  invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart,  ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy,  with something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of  justification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all  the semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with the  religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually  harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it  operates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon  sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner,  almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and  vindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity  and Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate  themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby  to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it  difficult enough to live--this very difficulty being necessary.    62. To be sure--to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such  religions, and to bring to light their secret dangers--the cost is  always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as an  educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but  rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they wish to be the final end,  and not a means along with other means. Among men, as among all other  animals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating,  infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases,  among men also, are always the exception; and in view of the fact that  man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare  exception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents, the  greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental, the  law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests  itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of  men, the conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult  to determine. What, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions  above-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour  to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the  religions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle;  they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a  disease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as  false and impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and  preservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied,  and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of  man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions--to give a general appreciation  of them--are among the principal causes which have kept the type of  \"man\" upon a lower level--they have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD  HAVE PERISHED. One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is  sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation  of all that the \"spiritual men\" of Christianity have done for Europe  hitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to  the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the helpless,  and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual  penitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had they  to do in order to work systematically in that fashion, and with a good  conscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, which  means, in deed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE  EUROPEAN RACE? To REVERSE all estimates of value--THAT is what they  had to do! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast  suspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything autonomous,  manly, conquering, and imperious--all instincts which are natural to the  highest and most successful type of \"man\"--into uncertainty, distress  of conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the  earthly and of supremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and  earthly things--THAT is the task the Church imposed on itself, and  was obliged to impose, until, according to its standard of value,  \"unworldliness,\" \"unsensuousness,\" and \"higher man\" fused into one  sentiment. If one could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse  and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and  impartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never cease  marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single will  has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a SUBLIME  ABORTION of man? He, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer  Epicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could approach this  almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in  the European Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to  cry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: \"Oh, you bunglers, presumptuous  pitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a work for your hands?  How you have hacked and botched my finest stone! What have you presumed  to do!\"--I should say that Christianity has hitherto been the most  portentous of presumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough,  to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men,  not sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime  self-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and  perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically  different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from  man:--SUCH men, with their \"equality before God,\" have hitherto swayed  the destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species  has been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly,  mediocre, the European of the present day.        CHAPTER IV. APOPHTHEGMS AND INTERLUDES      63. He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously--and even  himself--only in relation to his pupils.    64. \"Knowledge for its own sake\"--that is the last snare laid by  morality: we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more.    65. The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has  to be overcome on the way to it.    65A. We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED to  sin.    66. The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed,  deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men.    67. Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense  of all others. Love to God also!    68. \"I did that,\" says my memory. \"I could not have done that,\" says my  pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually--the memory yields.    69. One has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see the hand  that--kills with leniency.    70. If a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which  always recurs.    71. THE SAGE AS ASTRONOMER.--So long as thou feelest the stars as an  \"above thee,\" thou lackest the eye of the discerning one.    72. It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that  makes great men.    73. He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.    73A. Many a peacock hides his tail from every eye--and calls it his  pride.    74. A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possess at least two things  besides: gratitude and purity.    75. The degree and nature of a man's sensuality extends to the highest  altitudes of his spirit.    76. Under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself.    77. With his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or justify,  or honour, or reproach, or conceal his habits: two men with the same  principles probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith.    78. He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as a  despiser.    79. A soul which knows that it is loved, but does not itself love,  betrays its sediment: its dregs come up.    80. A thing that is explained ceases to concern us--What did the God  mean who gave the advice, \"Know thyself!\" Did it perhaps imply \"Cease to  be concerned about thyself! become objective!\"--And Socrates?--And the  \"scientific man\"?    81. It is terrible to die of thirst at sea. Is it necessary that you  should so salt your truth that it will no longer--quench thirst?    82. \"Sympathy for all\"--would be harshness and tyranny for THEE, my good  neighbour.    83. INSTINCT--When the house is on fire one forgets even the  dinner--Yes, but one recovers it from among the ashes.    84. Woman learns how to hate in proportion as she--forgets how to charm.    85. The same emotions are in man and woman, but in different TEMPO, on  that account man and woman never cease to misunderstand each other.    86. In the background of all their personal vanity, women themselves  have still their impersonal scorn--for \"woman\".    87. FETTERED HEART, FREE SPIRIT--When one firmly fetters one's heart  and keeps it prisoner, one can allow one's spirit many liberties: I said  this once before But people do not believe it when I say so, unless they  know it already.    88. One begins to distrust very clever persons when they become  embarrassed.    89. Dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who experiences  them is not"]]]
