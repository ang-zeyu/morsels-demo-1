That was an idea for the Tin Woodman to follow, and he  also crossed in safety while the great hammer was in the air.  But when  it came to the twenty-six officers and the private, their knees were so  weak that they could not walk a step.    \"In battle we are wonderfully courageous,\" said one of the generals,  \"and our foes find us very terrible to face.  But war is one thing and  this is another.  When it comes to being pounded upon the head by an  iron hammer, and smashed into pancakes, we naturally object.\"    \"Make a run for it,\" urged the Scarecrow.    \"Our knees shake so that we cannot run,\" answered a captain.  \"If we  should try it we would all certainly be pounded to a jelly.\"    \"Well, well,\" sighed the Cowardly Lion, \"I see, friend Tiger, that we  must place ourselves in great danger to rescue this bold army.  Come  with me, and we will do the best we can.\"    So, Ozma and Dorothy having already dismounted from their backs, the  Lion and the Tiger leaped back again under the awful hammer and  returned with two generals clinging to their necks.  They repeated this  daring passage twelve times, when all the officers had been carried  beneath the giant's legs and landed safely on the further side.  By  that time the beasts were very tired, and panted so hard that their  tongues hung out of their great mouths.    \"But what is to become of the private?\" asked Ozma.    \"Oh, leave him there to guard the chariot,\" said the Lion.  \"I'm tired  out, and won't pass under that mallet again.\"    The officers at once protested that they must have the private with  them, else there would be no one for them to command.  But neither the  Lion or the Tiger would go after him, and so the Scarecrow sent the  Sawhorse.    Either the wooden horse was careless, or it failed to properly time the  descent of the hammer, for the mighty weapon caught it squarely upon  its head, and thumped it against the ground so powerfully that the  private flew off its back high into the air, and landed upon one of the  giant's cast-iron arms.  Here he clung desperately while the arm rose  and fell with each one of the rapid strokes.    The Scarecrow dashed in to rescue his Sawhorse, and had his left foot  smashed by the hammer before he could pull the creature out of danger.  They then found that the Sawhorse had been badly dazed by the blow; for  while the hard wooden knot of which his head was formed could not be  crushed by the hammer, both his ears were broken off and he would be  unable to hear a sound until some new ones were made for him.  Also his  left knee was cracked, and had to be bound up with a string.    Billina having fluttered under the hammer, it now remained only to  rescue the private who was riding upon the iron giant's arm, high in  the air.    The Scarecrow lay flat upon the ground and called to the man to jump  down upon his body, which was soft because it was stuffed with straw.  This the private managed to do, waiting until a time when he was  nearest the ground and then letting himself drop upon the Scarecrow.  He accomplished the feat without breaking any bones, and the Scarecrow  declared he was not injured in the least.    Therefore, the Tin Woodman having by this time fitted new ears to the  Sawhorse, the entire party proceeded upon its way, leaving the giant to  pound the path behind them.          11.  The Nome King      By and by, when they drew near to the mountain that blocked their path  and which was the furthermost edge of the Kingdom of Ev, the way grew  dark and gloomy for the reason that the high peaks on either side shut  out the sunshine.  And it was very silent, too, as there were no birds  to sing or squirrels to chatter, the trees being left far behind them  and only the bare rocks remaining.    Ozma and Dorothy were a little awed by the silence, and all the others  were quiet and grave except the Sawhorse, which, as it trotted along  with the Scarecrow upon his back, hummed a queer song, of which this  was the chorus:      \"Would a wooden horse in a woodland go?      Aye, aye!  I sigh, he would, although    Had he not had a wooden head      He'd mount the mountain top instead.\"      But no one paid any attention to this because they were now close to  the Nome King's dominions, and his splendid underground palace could  not be very far away.    Suddenly they heard a shout of jeering laughter, and stopped short.  They would have to stop in a minute, anyway, for the huge mountain  barred their further progress and the path ran close up to a wall of  rock and ended.    \"Who was that laughing?\" asked Ozma.    There was no reply, but in the gloom they could see strange forms flit  across the face of the rock.  Whatever the creations might be they  seemed very like the rock itself, for they were the color of rocks and  their shapes were as rough and rugged as if they had been broken away  from the side of the mountain.  They kept close to the steep cliff  facing our friends, and glided up and down, and this way and that, with  a lack of regularity that was quite confusing.  And they seemed not to  need places to rest their feet, but clung to the surface of the rock as  a fly does to a window-pane, and were never still for a moment.    \"Do not mind them,\" said Tiktok, as Dorothy shrank back.  \"They are  on-ly the Nomes.\"    \"And what are Nomes?\" asked the girl, half frightened.    \"They are rock fair-ies, and serve the Nome King,\" replied the machine.  \"But they will do us no harm.  You must call for the King, be-cause  with-out him you can ne-ver find the en-trance to the pal-ace.\"    \"YOU call,\" said Dorothy to Ozma.    Just then the Nomes laughed again, and the sound was so weird and  disheartening that the twenty-six officers commanded the private to  \"right-about-face!\" and they all started to run as fast as they could.    The Tin Woodman at once pursued his army and cried \"halt!\" and when  they had stopped their flight he asked: \"Where are you going?\"    \"I--I find I've forgotten the brush for my whiskers,\" said a general,  trembling with fear.  \"S-s-so we are g-going back after it!\"    \"That is impossible,\" replied the Tin Woodman.  \"For the giant with the  hammer would kill you all if you tried to pass him.\"    \"Oh! I'd forgotten the giant,\" said the general, turning pale.    \"You seem to forget a good many things,\" remarked the Tin Woodman.  \"I  hope you won't forget that you are brave men.\"    \"Never!\" cried the general, slapping his gold-embroidered chest.    \"Never!\" cried all the other officers, indignantly slapping their  chests.    \"For my part,\" said the private, meekly, \"I must obey my officers; so  when I am told to run, I run; and when I am told to fight, I fight.\"    \"That is right,\" agreed the Tin Woodman.  \"And now you must all come  back to Ozma, and obey HER orders.  And if you try to run away again I  will have her reduce all the twenty-six officers to privates, and make  the private your general.\"    This terrible threat so frightened them that they at once returned to  where Ozma was standing beside the Cowardly Lion.    Then Ozma cried out in a loud voice:    \"I demand that the Nome King appear to us!\"    There was no reply, except that the shifting Nomes upon the mountain  laughed in derision.    \"You must not command the Nome King,\" said Tiktok, \"for you do not rule  him, as you do your own peo-ple.\"    So Ozma called again, saying:    \"I request the Nome King to appear to us.\"    Only the mocking laughter replied to her, and the shadowy Nomes  continued to flit here and there upon the rocky cliff.    \"Try en-treat-y,\" said Tiktok to Ozma.  \"If he will not come at your  re-quest, then the Nome King may list-en to your plead-ing.\"    Ozma looked around her proudly.    \"Do you wish your ruler to plead with this wicked Nome King?\" she  asked.  \"Shall Ozma of Oz humble herself to a creature who lives in an  underground kingdom?\"    \"No!\" they all shouted, with big voices; and the Scarecrow added:    \"If he will not come, we will dig him out of his hole, like a fox, and  conquer his stubbornness.  But our sweet little ruler must always  maintain her dignity, just as I maintain mine.\"    \"I'm not afraid to plead with him,\" said Dorothy.  \"I'm only a little  girl from Kansas, and we've got more dignity at home than we know what  to do with.  I'LL call the Nome King.\"    \"Do,\" said the Hungry Tiger; \"and if he makes hash of you I'll  willingly eat you for breakfast tomorrow morning.\"    So Dorothy stepped forward and said:    \"PLEASE Mr. Nome King, come here and see us.\"    The Nomes started to laugh again; but a low growl came from the  mountain, and in a flash they had all vanished from sight and were  silent.    Then a door in the rock opened, and a voice cried:    \"Enter!\"    \"Isn't it a trick?\" asked the Tin Woodman.    \"Never mind,\" replied Ozma.  \"We came here to rescue the poor Queen of  Ev and her ten children, and we must run some risks to do so.\"    \"The Nome King is hon-est and good na-tured,\" said Tiktok.  \"You can  trust him to do what is right.\"    So Ozma led the way, hand in hand with Dorothy, and they passed through  the arched doorway of rock and entered a long passage which was lighted  by jewels set in the walls and having lamps behind them.  There was no  one to escort them, or to show them the way, but all the party pressed  through the passage until they came to a round, domed cavern that was  grandly furnished.    In the center of this room was a throne carved out of a solid boulder  of rock, rude and rugged in shape but glittering with great rubies and  diamonds and emeralds on every part of its surface.  And upon the  throne sat the Nome King.    This important monarch of the Underground World was a little fat man  clothed in gray-brown garments that were the exact color of the rock  throne in which he was seated.  His bushy hair and flowing beard were  also colored like the rocks, and so was his face.

The existing roads and bridges,  in most places so narrow as to permit only one-way traffic, would  soon disintegrate under the constant heavy rains and the pounding  of military vehicles. Colonel Ely forecast that, in the light  of past experience with poor conditions of soil and drainage, the  construction and enlargement of the airstrips would be difficult. The  shortage of engineer troops decreased the possibility of providing  major air and supply bases in sufficient time to properly support  further operations. He concluded that \"the construction mission  cannot be satisfactorily accomplished with the engineer troops  available, particularly during the first 90 days.\" Colonel Ely  gloomily summarized, \"Perhaps we can mud and muddle through again on  a shoestring but the shoestring must be frayed by this time and if  it broke we may lose our shirt as well as our shoe.\"    If the strategic plan were fixed, he recommended that one or more of  the following measures be adopted: (1) increase the number of engineer  construction troops; (2) shift the operation to an area where major  air and supply bases could be constructed without encountering the  adverse weather and port conditions existing on Leyte; (3) \"decrease  the tempo of the strategic plan\"; and finally (4) decrease the scope  of the air and supply requirements. Nothing was to be gained \"by  undertaking an overambitious program from the beginning that cannot  be completed on a time schedule that will assure early and adequate  support to future operations.\" [107]    Col. Samuel D. Sturgis, Jr., Sixth Army Engineer, forwarded Colonel  Ely's report with a strong concurrence to General MacArthur's engineer,  but General Headquarters decided to proceed with the original  logistical plans for the operation. [108]        Supplies    The supplies required for the operation involved staggering  quantities. For an invasion force of 150,000 men, the War Department  figures showed that, for the landing period alone, 1,500,000 tons  of general equipment, 235,000 tons of combat vehicles, 200,000  tons of ammunition, and 200,000 tons of medical supplies were  required. Thereafter, 332,000 tons of equipment would be required  every thirty days. [109] According to the final plan, issued by  General Krueger on 30 September 1944, [110] the units of the Sixth  Army, X Corps, and Sixth Army Service Command, under General Casey,  which were to arrive at Leyte between 20 and 30 October were to take  ashore a minimum of ten days' supply of all classes (except engineer  supplies, which were to be for at least thirty days), and two units  of fire. [111] In this way the strain on ASCOM supply units would be  lessened, and ASCOM, it was hoped, would have time to establish dumps  and make the necessary supply installations. In addition to supplies  accompanying the assault troops, sufficient quantities were to be  brought into Leyte by 30 October to bring the total supplies for the  troops to the following figures, expressed in days: thirty days of  food, clothing, and equipment; fifteen days of motor transport fuel  and distillate; and thirty days of other petroleum products. There were  also to be five units of fire for combat troops and three for service  troops. The original plan had called for a thirty-day supply of all  petroleum products to be brought in by A plus 10, but this quantity  was reduced when General Krueger adopted a plan for the installation  by A plus 7 of bulk fuel storage. The XXIV Corps supply levels were to  remain the same as those planned for the now-canceled Yap operation,  since the corps was already loaded with supplies which were considered  adequate for the Leyte invasion. [112]    There were certain differences in the loads carried by the X and the  XXIV Corps. The XXIV Corps embarked with a thirty-day supply of rations  and medical supplies, twenty days of clothing, weapons, vehicles,  fuels, lubricants, construction matériel, and seven units of fire for  all artillery and five units for other types of weapons. Since the type  of equipment loaded had been selected for the Yap operation, amphibian  vehicles were favored over wheeled vehicles. Less than 50 percent of  the Table of Equipment allowance of general purpose vehicles and dump  trucks accompanied the units. Furthermore, many badly needed items  of organizational equipment were carried by the rear echelons, which  did not arrive until January 1945, after Leyte had been secured. [113]    The supplies which were to accompany the troops during the initial  phases of the Leyte operation were to come from bases in New Guinea  and the Central Pacific. Resupply shipping--to be called for as  needed--was to be loaded at bases in the United States, Australia, and,  if necessary, New Guinea. [114] In addition, ten loaded liberty ships  were to be held in floating reserve, eight at Hollandia and two in the  Palaus. Two of these were loaded with aviation gasoline, two with fuel  oil and lubricants, two with ammunition for the air forces and four  with ammunition for the ground forces. Admiral Nimitz was to furnish  two of the four last mentioned. Except for the LST's transporting  the XXIV Corps, each LST arriving on 20 October was to carry thirty  tons of technical supplies for the air forces. All LST's arriving  from A plus 1 through A plus 4 were to carry forty tons of similar  supplies. [115] General MacArthur charged the Commanding General,  United States Army Services of Supply (SWPA), with providing the  Sixth Army with all supplies, except air force technical supplies,  that would be needed for the operation. [116]    An Army garrison force for Yap under Maj. Gen. Roscoe B. Woodruff  had been scheduled to go with the XXIV Corps, and at Admiral Nimitz'  suggestion this force was designated to accompany the corps to the  new target, Leyte, though the Southwest Pacific Area had never  used an organization of this type. [117] It was hoped that the  force might be useful in taking over \"house-keeping\" duties and the  development of rear areas, thus relieving the assault commander of  those responsibilities. Incidentally, General Krueger made little  use of the garrison force. Units which furnished logistic support  for carrier operations were also included and were to be assigned to  the Seventh Fleet. Admiral Nimitz was to continue furnishing logistic  support to the XXIV Corps until relieved by General MacArthur. [118]        Shipping    On 21 September, Pacific Ocean Areas and Southwest Pacific Area reached  an agreement on resupply of ammunition for the XXIV Corps. Arrangements  were made for loaded ships from San Francisco to be sent to the Leyte  area periodically to alleviate the shipping shortage. [119] It was  expected that at least twenty-two cargo ships would so arrive from  San Francisco during the operation.    The change in target dates and the substitution of the XXIV Corps for  the XIV Corps reduced the amount of amphibious shipping available for  the Leyte operation. Consequently representatives of the Sixth Army,  the VII Amphibious Force, and the Fifth Air Force met at General  Krueger's headquarters to work out the details for a new shipping  schedule. They made minor changes in the dates for the movement of  convoys, and rearranged echelons, eliminating one. [120] The shipping  for the XXIV Corps and the ten resupply ships were to remain the same  as planned for Yap. [121]    The amphibious shipping allocated to MacArthur was to be made available  for such turnaround shipping as would be required. The date of release  of the amphibious vessels in order to mount subsequent operations would  be announced later, but none were to be released for return to Nimitz'  control without permission from MacArthur. An additional division  lift, which was not included, was to return the 77th Division from  Guam to Guadalcanal or to a location indicated by Admiral Nimitz. [122]    On 25 September Sixth Army submitted to General Headquarters a schedule  of cargo loadings of heavy shipping for the Leyte operation and made  suggestions as to heavy shipping for direct movement of troops. All  troops and supply ships with the assault convoy which were to depart  from Hollandia must arrive in that area not later than A minus 9. [123]    The shipping instructions specified that the ships were to be loaded  for selective discharge; all resupply ships transporting rations,  clothing, vehicles, weapons, and ammunition would be duplicate loaded;  loaded floating reserve ships would be provided; medical supplies would  be top loaded to avoid breakage and damage; and sufficient stevedore  gear would be placed aboard each ship to handle its cargo. On 25 and  26 September General Krueger's transportation officer submitted to  General Headquarters the heavy shipping requirements for the overwater  movement of cargo and troops, respectively. It was considered necessary  to utilize \"all types of shipping from Navy LSM's, LST's, and assault  transports to army controlled merchant ships and troop carriers.\" [124]  Additional shipping was obtained by making use of that which had  carried the 1st Marine Division and the 81st Division to Peleliu and  Angaur in the Palau Islands. [125] The shipping specified above was  assembled at Manus and Hollandia and was assigned to the 1st Cavalry  Division and the 24th Division, which were embarking, respectively,  at those two ports. The XXIV Corps, after leaving the Hawaiian Islands,  was brought to Manus where it remained in its original shipping.    On 8 October General Krueger asked the commanding generals of X  Corps, XXIV Corps, and ASCOM, together with the commanding officers  of the"]]]
