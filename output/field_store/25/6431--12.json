He waited till Mr Seymour had paid his nightly  visit--he went the round of the dormitories at about eleven--and then he  chuckled gently. If Mill, the dormitory prefect, was awake, the chuckle  would make him speak, for Mill was of a suspicious nature, and believed  that it was only his unintermitted vigilance which prevented the  dormitory ragging all night.    Mill _was_ awake.    \"Be quiet, there,\" he growled. \"Shut up that noise.\"    Shoeblossom felt that the time was not yet ripe for his departure. Half  an hour later he tried again. There was no rebuke. To make certain he  emitted a second chuckle, replete with sinister meaning. A slight snore  came from the direction of Mill's bed. Shoeblossom crept out of the  room, and hurried to his study. The door was not locked, for Mr Seymour  had relied on his commands being sufficient to keep the owner out of  it. He slipped in, found and lit the dark lantern, and settled down to  read. He read with feverish excitement. The thing was, you see, that  though Claud Trevelyan (that was the hero) knew jolly well that it was  Jasper who had done the murder, the police didn't, and, as he (Claud)  was too noble to tell them, he had himself been arrested on suspicion.  Shoeblossom was skimming through the pages with starting eyes, when  suddenly his attention was taken from his book by a sound. It was a  footstep. Somebody was coming down the passage, and under the door  filtered a thin stream of light. To snap the dark slide over the  lantern and dart to the door, so that if it opened he would be behind  it, was with him, as Mr Claud Trevelyan might have remarked, the work  of a moment. He heard the door of study number five flung open, and  then the footsteps passed on, and stopped opposite his own den. The  handle turned, and the light of a candle flashed into the room, to be  extinguished instantly as the draught of the moving door caught it.    Shoeblossom heard his visitor utter an exclamation of annoyance, and  fumble in his pocket for matches. He recognised the voice. It was Mr  Seymour's. The fact was that Mr Seymour had had the same experience as  General Stanley in _The Pirates of Penzance_:        The man who finds his conscience ache,        No peace at all enjoys;      And, as I lay in bed awake,        I thought I heard a noise.    Whether Mr Seymour's conscience ached or not, cannot, of course, be  discovered. But he had certainly thought he heard a noise, and he had  come to investigate.    The search for matches had so far proved fruitless. Shoeblossom stood  and quaked behind the door. The reek of hot tin from the dark lantern  grew worse momentarily. Mr Seymour sniffed several times, until  Shoeblossom thought that he must be discovered. Then, to his immense  relief, the master walked away. Shoeblossom's chance had come. Mr  Seymour had probably gone to get some matches to relight his candle. It  was far from likely that the episode was closed. He would be back again  presently. If Shoeblossom was going to escape, he must do it now, so he  waited till the footsteps had passed away, and then darted out in the  direction of his dormitory.    As he was passing Milton's study, a white figure glided out of it. All  that he had ever read or heard of spectres rushed into Shoeblossom's  petrified brain. He wished he was safely in bed. He wished he had never  come out of it. He wished he had led a better and nobler life. He  wished he had never been born.    The figure passed quite close to him as he stood glued against the  wall, and he saw it disappear into the dormitory opposite his own, of  which Rigby was prefect. He blushed hotly at the thought of the fright  he had been in. It was only somebody playing the same game as himself.    He jumped into bed and lay down, having first plunged the lantern  bodily into his jug to extinguish it. Its indignant hiss had scarcely  died away when Mr Seymour appeared at the door. It had occurred to Mr  Seymour that he had smelt something very much out of the ordinary in  Shoeblossom's study, a smell uncommonly like that of hot tin. And a  suspicion dawned on him that Shoeblossom had been in there with a dark  lantern. He had come to the dormitory to confirm his suspicions. But a  glance showed him how unjust they had been. There was Shoeblossom fast  asleep. Mr Seymour therefore followed the excellent example of my Lord  Tomnoddy on a celebrated occasion, and went off to bed.           *       *       *       *       *    It was the custom for the captain of football at Wrykyn to select and  publish the team for the Ripton match a week before the day on which it  was to be played. On the evening after the Nomads' match, Trevor was  sitting in his study writing out the names, when there came a knock at  the door, and his fag entered with a letter.    \"This has just come, Trevor,\" he said.    \"All right. Put it down.\"    The fag left the room. Trevor picked up the letter. The handwriting was  strange to him. The words had been printed. Then it flashed upon him  that he had received a letter once before addressed in the same  way--the letter from the League about Barry. Was this, too, from  that address? He opened it.    It was.    He read it, and gasped. The worst had happened. The gold bat was in the  hands of the enemy.          XIII    VICTIM NUMBER THREE      \"With reference to our last communication,\" ran the letter--the writer  evidently believed in the commercial style--\"it may interest you to  know that the bat you lost by the statue on the night of the 26th of  January has come into our possession. _We observe that Barry is still  playing for the first fifteen._\"    \"And will jolly well continue to,\" muttered Trevor, crumpling the paper  viciously into a ball.    He went on writing the names for the Ripton match. The last name on the  list was Barry's.    Then he sat back in his chair, and began to wrestle with this new  development. Barry must play. That was certain. All the bluff in the  world was not going to keep him from playing the best man at his disposal  in the Ripton match. He himself did not count. It was the school he had  to think of. This being so, what was likely to happen? Though nothing  was said on the point, he felt certain that if he persisted in ignoring  the League, that bat would find its way somehow--by devious routes,  possibly--to the headmaster or some one else in authority. And then  there would be questions--awkward questions--and things would begin  to come out. Then a fresh point struck him, which was, that whatever  might happen would affect, not himself, but O'Hara. This made it rather  more of a problem how to act. Personally, he was one of those dogged  characters who can put up with almost anything themselves. If this had  been his affair, he would have gone on his way without hesitating.  Evidently the writer of the letter was under the impression that he  had been the hero (or villain) of the statue escapade.    If everything came out it did not require any great effort of prophecy  to predict what the result would be. O'Hara would go. Promptly. He  would receive his marching orders within ten minutes of the discovery  of what he had done. He would be expelled twice over, so to speak, once  for breaking out at night--one of the most heinous offences in the  school code--and once for tarring the statue. Anything that gave the  school a bad name in the town was a crime in the eyes of the powers,  and this was such a particularly flagrant case. Yes, there was no doubt  of that. O'Hara would take the first train home without waiting to pack  up. Trevor knew his people well, and he could imagine their feelings  when the prodigal strolled into their midst--an old Wrykinian _malgre  lui_. As the philosopher said of falling off a ladder, it is not the  falling that matters: it is the sudden stopping at the other end. It is  not the being expelled that is so peculiarly objectionable: it is the  sudden homecoming. With this gloomy vision before him, Trevor almost  wavered. But the thought that the selection of the team had nothing  whatever to do with his personal feelings strengthened him. He was  simply a machine, devised to select the fifteen best men in the school  to meet Ripton. In his official capacity of football captain he was not  supposed to have any feelings. However, he yielded in so far that he  went to Clowes to ask his opinion.    Clowes, having heard everything and seen the letter, unhesitatingly  voted for the right course. If fifty mad Irishmen were to be expelled,  Barry must play against Ripton. He was the best man, and in he must go.    \"That's what I thought,\" said Trevor. \"It's bad for O'Hara, though.\"    Clowes remarked somewhat tritely that business was business.    \"Besides,\" he went on, \"you're assuming that the thing this letter  hints at will really come off. I don't think it will. A man would have  to be such an awful blackguard to go as low as that. The least grain of  decency in him would stop him. I can imagine a man threatening to do it  as a piece of bluff--by the way, the letter doesn't actually say  anything of the sort, though I suppose it hints at it--but I can't  imagine anybody out of a melodrama doing it.\"    \"You can never tell,\" said Trevor. He felt that this was but an outside  chance. The forbearance of one's antagonist is but a poor thing to  trust to at the best of times.    \"Are you going to tell O'Hara?\" asked Clowes.    \"I don't see the good. Would you?\"    \"No. He can't do anything, and it would only give him a bad time. There  are pleasanter things, I should think, than going on from day to day not  knowing whether you're going to be sacked or not within the next twelve  hours. Don't tell him.\"    \"I won't. And Barry plays against Ripton.\"    \"Certainly. He's the best man.\"    \"I'm going over to Seymour's now,\" said Trevor, after a pause, \"to see  Milton."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#13)"],[1," at Shantarah are twelve in number. The object is to  place three men in line,--as the German Muhle and the Afghan \"Kitar,\"--  when any one of the adversary's pieces may be removed.    Children usually prefer the game called indifferently Togantog and  Saddikiya. A double line of five or six holes is made in the ground, four  counters are placed in each, and when in the course of play four men meet  in the same hole, one of the adversary's is removed. It resembles the  Bornou game, played with beans and holes in the sand. Citizens and the  more civilised are fond of \"Bakkis,\" which, as its name denotes, is a  corruption of the well-known Indian Pachisi. None but the travelled know  chess, and the Damal (draughts) and Tavola (backgammon) of the Turks.    [15] The same objection against \"villanous saltpetre\" was made by  ourselves in times of old: the French knights called gunpowder the Grave  of Honor. This is natural enough, the bravest weapon being generally the  shortest--that which places a man hand to hand with his opponent. Some of  the Kafir tribes have discontinued throwing the Assegai, and enter battle  wielding it as a pike. Usually, also, the shorter the weapon is, the more  fatal are the conflicts in which it is employed. The old French \"Briquet,\"  the Afghan \"Charay,\" and the Goorka \"Kukkri,\" exemplify this fact in the  history of arms.    [16] In the latter point it differs from the Assegai, which is worked by  the Kafirs to the finest temper.    [17] It is called by the Arabs Kubabah, by the Somal Goasa. Johnston  (Travels in Southern Abyssinia, chap. 8.) has described the game; he errs,  however, in supposing it peculiar to the Dankali tribes.    [18] This is in fact the pilgrim dress of El Islam; its wide diffusion to  the eastward, as well as west of the Red Sea, proves its antiquity as a  popular dress.    [19] I often regretted having neglected the precaution of a bottle of  walnut juice,--a white colour is decidedly too conspicuous in this part of  the East.    [20] The strict rule of the Moslem faith is this: if a man neglect to  pray, he is solemnly warned to repent. Should he simply refuse, without,  however, disbelieving in prayer, he is to be put to death, and receive  Moslem burial; in the other contingency, he is not bathed, prayed for, or  interred in holy ground. This severe order, however, lies in general  abeyance.    [21] \"Tuarick grandiloquence,\" says Richardson (vol. i. p. 207.), \"savours  of blasphemy, e.g. the lands, rocks, and mountains of Ghat do not belong  to God but to the Azghar.\" Equally irreverent are the Kafirs of the Cape.  They have proved themselves good men in wit as well as war; yet, like the  old Greenlanders and some of the Burmese tribes, they are apparently  unable to believe in the existence of the Supreme. A favourite question to  the missionaries was this, \"Is your God white or black?\" If the European,  startled by the question, hesitated for a moment, they would leave him  with open signs of disgust at having been made the victims of a hoax.    The assertion generally passes current that the idea of an Omnipotent  Being is familiar to all people, even the most barbarous. My limited  experience argues the contrary. Savages begin with fetisism and demon-  worship, they proceed to physiolatry (the religion of the Vedas) and  Sabaeism: the deity is the last and highest pinnacle of the spiritual  temple, not placed there except by a comparatively civilised race of high  development, which leads them to study and speculate upon cosmical and  psychical themes. This progression is admirably wrought out in Professor  Max Muller's \"Rig Veda Sanhita.\"    [22] The Moslem corpse is partly sentient in the tomb, reminding the  reader of Tennyson:      \"I thought the dead had peace, but it is not so;    To have no peace in the grave, is that not sad?\"    [23] The prayers for the dead have no Rukaat or bow as in other orisons.    [24] The general Moslem name for the African coast from the Somali  seaboard southwards to the Mozambique, inhabited by negrotic races.    [25] The Moslem rosary consists of ninety-nine beads divided into sets of  thirty-three each by some peculiar sign, as a bit of red coral.  [Illustration] The consulter, beginning at a chance place, counts up to  the mark: if the number of beads be odd, he sets down a single dot, if  even, two. This is done four times, when a figure is produced as in the  margin. Of these there are sixteen, each having its peculiar name and  properties. The art is merely Geomancy in its rudest shape; a mode of  vaticination which, from its wide diffusion, must be of high antiquity.  The Arabs call it El Baml, and ascribe its present form to the Imam Jaafar  el Sadik; amongst them it is a ponderous study, connected as usual with  astrology. Napoleon's \"Book of Fate\" is a specimen of the old Eastern  superstition presented to Europe in a modern and simple form.    [26] In this country, as in Western and Southern Africa, the leopard, not  the wolf, is the shepherd's scourge.    [27] Popular superstition in Abyssinia attributes the same power to the  Felashas or Jews.    [28] Our Elixir, a corruption of the Arabic El Iksir.    [29] In the Somali tongue its name is Barki: they make a stool of similar  shape, and call it Barjimo.    [30] Specimens of these discourses have been given by Mr. Lane, Mod.  Egypt, chap. 3. It is useless to offer others, as all bear the closest  resemblance.          CHAP. III.    EXCURSIONS NEAR ZAYLA.      We determined on the 9th of November to visit the island of Saad el Din,  the larger of the two patches of ground which lie about two miles north of  the town. Reaching our destination, after an hour's lively sail, we passed  through a thick belt of underwood tenanted by swarms of midges, with a  damp chill air crying fever, and a fetor of decayed vegetation smelling  death. To this succeeded a barren flat of silt and sand, white with salt  and ragged with salsolaceous stubble, reeking with heat, and covered with  old vegetation. Here, says local tradition, was the ancient site of Zayla  [1], built by Arabs from Yemen. The legend runs that when Saad el Din was  besieged and slain by David, King of Ethiopia, the wells dried up and the  island sank. Something doubtless occurred which rendered a removal  advisable: the sons of the Moslem hero fled to Ahmed bin El Ashraf, Prince  of Senaa, offering their allegiance if he would build fortifications for  them and aid them against the Christians of Abyssinia. The consequence was  a walled circuit upon the present site of Zayla: of its old locality  almost may be said \"periere ruinae.\"    During my stay with Sharmarkay I made many inquiries about historical  works, and the Kazi; Mohammed Khatib, a Harar man of the Hawiyah tribe,  was at last persuaded to send his Daftar, or office papers, for my  inspection. They formed a kind of parish register of births, deaths,  marriages, divorces, and manumissions. From them it appeared that in A.H.  1081 (A.D. 1670-71) the Shanabila Sayyids were Kazis of Zayla and retained  the office for 138 years. It passed two generations ago into the hands of  Mohammed Musa, a Hawiyah, and the present Kazi is his nephew.    The origin of Zayla, or, as it is locally called, \"Audal,\" is lost in the  fogs of Phoenician fable. The Avalites [2] of the Periplus and Pliny, it  was in earliest ages dependent upon the kingdom of Axum. [3] About the  seventh century, when the Southern Arabs penetrated into the heart of  Abyssinia [4], it became the great factory of the eastern coast, and rose  to its height of splendour. Taki el Din Makrizi [5] includes under the  name of Zayla, a territory of forty-three days' march by forty, and  divides it into seven great provinces, speaking about fifty languages, and  ruled by Amirs, subject to the Hati (Hatze) of Abyssinia.    In the fourteenth century it became celebrated by its wars with the kings  of Abyssinia: sustaining severe defeats the Moslems retired upon their  harbour, which, after an obstinate defence fell into the hands of the  Christians. The land was laid waste, the mosques were converted into  churches, and the Abyssinians returned to their mountains laden with  booty. About A.D. 1400, Saad el Din, the heroic prince of Zayla, was  besieged in his city by the Hatze David the Second: slain by a spear-  thrust, he left his people powerless in the hands of their enemies, till  his sons, Sabr el Din, Ali, Mansur, and Jemal el Din retrieved the cause  of El Islam.    Ibn Batuta, a voyager of the fourteenth century, thus describes the place:  \"I then went from Aden by sea, and after four days came to the city of  Zayla. This is a settlement, of the Berbers [6], a people of Sudan, of the  Shafia sect. Their country is a desert of two months' extent; the first  part is termed Zayla, the last Makdashu. The greatest number of the  inhabitants, however, are of the Rafizah sect. [7] Their food is mostly  camels' flesh and fish. [8] The stench of the country is extreme, as is  also its filth, from the stink of the fish and the blood of camels which  are slaughtered in its streets.\"    About A.D. 1500 the Turks conquered Yemen, and the lawless Janissaries,  \"who lived upon the very bowels of commerce\" [9], drove the peaceable Arab  merchants to the opposite shore. The trade of India, flying from the same  enemy, took refuge in Adel, amongst its partners. [10] The Turks of  Arabia, though they were blind to the cause, were sensible of the great  influx of wealth into the opposite kingdoms. They took possession,  therefore, of Zayla, which they made a den of thieves, established there  what they called a custom-house [11], and, by means of that post and  galleys cruising in the narrow straits of Bab el Mandeb, they laid the  Indian trade to Adel under heavy contributions that might indemnify them  for the great desertion their violence and injustice had occasioned in  Arabia.
