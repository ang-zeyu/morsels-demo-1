While he was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was      opened to my mind that I could see the place where the plates were      deposited, and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place      again when I visited it.        After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to      gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking      to me, and it continued to do so, until the room was again left      dark, except just around him, when instantly I saw, as it were,      a conduit open right up into heaven, and he ascended until he      entirely disappeared, and the room was left as it had been before      this heavenly light had made its appearance.        I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, and marveling      greatly at what had been told me by this extraordinary messenger;      when, in the midst of my meditation, I suddenly discovered that      my room was again beginning to get lighted, and in an instant, as      it were, the same heavenly messenger was again by my bedside. He      commenced, and again related the very same things which he had      done at his first visit, without the least variation; which having      done, he informed me of great judgments which were coming upon the      earth, with great desolations by famine, sword, and pestilence;      and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this      generation. Having related these things, he again ascended as he      had done before.        By this time, so deep were the impressions made on my mind, that      sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay overwhelmed in astonishment      at what I had both seen and heard. But what was my surprise when      again I beheld the same messenger at my bedside, and heard him      rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things as before; and      added a caution to me, telling me that Satan would try to tempt      me, (in consequence of the indigent circumstances of my father's      family) to get the plates for the purpose of getting rich. This      he forbade me, saying that I must have no other object in view in      getting the plates but to glorify God, and must not be influenced      by any other motive than that of building his kingdom; otherwise I      could not get them. After this third visit, he again ascended into      heaven as before, and I was again left to ponder on the strangeness      of what I had just experienced; when almost immediately after      the heavenly messenger had ascended from me the third time, the      cock crowed, and I found that day was approaching, so that our      interviews must have occupied the whole of that night.        I shortly after arose from my bed, and, as usual, went to the      necessary labors of the day; but in attempting to work as at other      times, I found my strength so exhausted as to render me entirely      unable. My father, who was laboring along with me, discovered      something to be wrong with me, and told me to go home. I started      with the intention of going to the house; but in attempting to      cross the fence out of the field where we were, my strength      entirely failed me, and I fell helpless on the ground, and for a      time was quite unconscious of anything. The first thing that I      can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, calling me by name:      I looked up and beheld the same messenger standing over my head,      surrounded by light as before. He then again related unto me all      that he had related to me the previous night, and commanded me to      go to my father and tell him of the vision and commandments which I      had received.        I obeyed; I returned to my father in the field, and rehearsed      the whole matter to him. He replied to me that it was of God, and      told me to go and do as commanded by the messenger. [10] I left      the field and went to the place where the messenger had told me      the plates were deposited; and owing to the distinctness of the      vision which I had had concerning it, I knew the place the instant      that I arrived there. Convenient to the village of Manchester,      Ontario county, New York, stands a hill of considerable size, and      the most elevated of any in the neighborhood. On the west side of      this hill, not far from the top, under a stone of considerable size      lay the plates, deposited in a stone box. This stone was thick and      rounding in the middle on the upper side, and thinner towards the      edges, so that the middle part of it was visible above the ground,      but the edge all round was covered with earth. Having removed the      earth I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under the edge of the      stone, and with a little exertion raised it up. I looked in, and      there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the      breastplate as stated by the messenger. The box in which they lay      was formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement. In the      bottom of the box were laid two stones crossways of the box, and on      these stones lay the plates and the other things with them. I made      an attempt to take them out, but was forbidden by the messenger,      and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth had      not yet arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time;      but he told me that I should come to that place precisely in one      year from that time, and that he would there meet with me, and that      I should continue to do so until the time should come for obtaining      the plates. [11]        Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each      year, and at each time I found the same messenger there, and      received instruction and intelligence from him at each of our      interviews, respecting what the Lord was going to do, and how and      in what manner his kingdom was to be conducted in the last days. *      * * At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim      and Thummim and the breast-plate. On the 22nd day of September,      1827, having gone as usual at the end of another year to the place      where they were deposited, the same heavenly messenger delivered      them up to me with this charge; that I should be responsible for      them; that if I should let them go carelessly, or through any      neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would use all      my endeavors to preserve them, until he, the messenger, should call      for them, they would be protected. [12]        I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict      charges to keep them safe, and why it was that the messenger had      said that when I had done what was required at my hands, he would      call for them. For no sooner was it known that I had them, than      the most strenuous exertions were used to get them from me; every      stratagem that could be invented, was resorted to for that purpose.      The persecution became more bitter and severe than before, and      multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if      possible. But by the wisdom of God they remained safe in my hands,      until I accomplished by them what was required at my hands; when,      according to arrangements, the messenger called for them, [and] I      delivered them up to him; and he has them in his charge until this      day, being the 2nd of May, 1838. [13]    Such in Joseph Smith's account of the origin of the Book of Mormon.  This is the account of its origin accepted by those who believe it to  be a divine record, a volume of scripture, containing the word of God,  and a history--though a brief one--of the hand-dealings of God with the  people of the western hemisphere. This is the account of its origin to  be maintained by those who speak or write in the defense of the Book of  Mormon. This the account to be maintained as true in these pages.    It will readily be observed that the history given by Joseph Smith  concerning his finding the Nephite record is very concise; that details  are omitted. This is especially noticeable in regard to the efforts  of his enemies to get the plates from him; he merely makes general  reference to that subject; as also in the matter as to what passed  between himself and the angel Moroni at the annual meetings between  1823 and 1827. Of these visits, so interesting and instructive to  Joseph Smith, he only says:        \"I went at the end of each year, and at each time I found the same      messenger there, and received instructions and intelligence from      him at each of our interviews, respecting what the Lord was going      to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom was to be conducted      in the last days.\"    Doubtless, however, the instructions then received but only so casually  mentioned by the prophet, bore fruit in the progress of the work, in  the things which the prophet said and did. The fact that much more  happened than is stated in the narrative here quoted is evident; and  not only is it evident from what the prophet himself says, but from  what has been written by others who were associated with him in the  work, and who must have received their information from the Prophet  Joseph himself. Among these is Oliver Cowdery, who was the second  Elder of the Church, and the first to give to the world any account in  detail of these early events connected with the coming forth of the  great work of God. This he did in 1834-5, in a series of nine letters  to the _Saints Messenger and Advocate_, published at Kirtland, Ohio,  under the caption, \"Early Scenes and Incidents in the Church.\" And as  these letters were published in the lifetime of the prophet, with his  sanction and in a periodical published by the Church, it cannot be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#13)"],[1," outside the cities.  It is kept by Joshua as aedituus, who sleeps in it, as did Samuel  the aedituus for Eli.  ****************************************    in connection with the Mosaic camp, and outside it, just as the older  high places generally had open sites without the city.  The question  before us has reference exclusively to the particular tent which,  according to Exodus xxv. seq., was erected at the command of God  as the basis of the theocracy, the pre-Solomonic central sanctuary,  which also in outward details was the prototype of the temple.  At the outset its very  possibility is doubtful.  Very strange is the  contrast between this splendid structure, on which the costliest  material is lavished and wrought in the most advanced style of  Oriental art, and the soil on which it rises, in the wilderness  amongst the native Hebrew nomad tribes, who are represented as  having got it ready offhand, and without external help.  The  incompatibility has long been noticed, and gave rise to doubts as  early as the time of Voltaire.  These may, however, be left to  themselves; suffice it that Hebrew tradition, even from the time  of the judges and the first kings, for which the Mosaic tabernacle  was strictly speaking intended, knows nothing at all about it.    It appears a bold thing to say so when one sees how much many a  modern author who knows how to make a skilful use of the Book of  Chronicles has to tell about the tabernacle.  For in 2 Chron. i.3  seq. we are told that Solomon celebrated his accession to the  throne with a great sacrificial feast at Gibeon, because the  tabernacle and the brazen altar of Moses were there.  In like  manner in 1Chron. xxi.29 it is said that David offered sacrifice  indeed on the threshing-floor of Araunah, but that Jehovah's  dwelling-place and the legitimate altar were at that time at  Gibeon; and further (xvi. 39), that Zadok, the legitimate high  priest, officiated there.  From these data the Rabbins first, and  in recent times Keil and Movers especially, have constructed a  systematic history of the tabernacle down to the building of the  temple.  Under David and Solomon, as long as the ark was on Mount  Zion, the tabernacle was at Gibeon, as is also shown by the fact  that (2Samuel xxi.6, 9) offerings were sacrificed to Jehovah there.  Before that it was at Nob, where ephod and shewbread (1Samuel xxi.)  are mentioned, and still earlier, from Joshua's time onward, it was  at Shiloh.  But these were only its permanent sites, apart from  which it was temporarily set up now here, now there, saving by  its rapidity of movement--one might almost say ubiquity--the  unity of the cultus, notwithstanding the variety and great  distances of the places at which that cultus was celebrated.  In  every case in which a manifestation of Jehovah and an offering to  Him are spoken of, the tabernacle must be tacitly understood. /1/    ************************************  1. Josh. xxiv. 24, 33 (LXX): after the death of Joshua and Eleazar,  LABONTES (OI )UIOI )ISRAHL THN KIBWTON TOU QEOU PERIFEROSAN  )EN )EAUTOIS.  After J. Buxtorf and Sal. van Til (Ugol., Thes. viii.),  this theory has been, worked out specially by Movers.  See, on the other  hand, De Wette, Beitraege, p. 108 seq., and Vatke, ut supra, p. 316, note.  ************************************    The dogmatic character of this way of making history, and the absurd  consequences to which it leads, need not in the meantime be insisted on;  what is of greatest importance is that the point from which it starts  is in the last degree insecure; for the statement of Chronicles that  Solomon offered the offering of his accession upon the altar of  the tabernacle at Gibeon is in contradiction with that of the older  parallel narrative of 1Kings iii.1-4.  The latter not only is  silent about the Mosaic tabernacle, which is alleged to have stood  at Gibeon, but expressly says that Solomon offered upon a high  place (as such), and excuses him for this on the plea that at that  time no house to the name of Jehovah had as yet been built.  That  the Chronicler draws from this narrative is certain on general  grounds, and is shown particularly by this, that he designates  the tabernacle at Gibeon by the name of Bamah--a contradictio in  adjecto which is only to be explained by the desire to give an  authentic interpretation of \"the great Bamah at Gibeon\" in 1Kings  iii.  Here, as elsewhere, he brings the history into agreement  with the Law: the young and pious Solomon can have offered his  sacrifice only at the legal place which therefore must be that  high place at Gibeon. Along with 2 Chron. i.3 seq. also fall the  two other statements (1Chron. xvi.39, xxi.29 both of which are  dependent on that leading passage, as is clear revealed by the  recurring phrase \"the Bamah of Gibeon.\" The tabernacle does not  elsewhere occur in Chronicles; it has not yet brought its  consequences with it, and not yet permeated the historical view of  the author.  He would certainly have experienced some embarrassment  at the question whether it had previously stood at Nob, for he  lays stress upon the connection between the legitimate sanctuary  and the legitimate Zadok-Eleazar priestly family, which it is  indeed possible to assume for Shiloh, but not for Nob. /1/    ************************************  1. Of the priests at Nob, Abiathar alone escaped the massacre  (1Samuel. xxii.); Gad therefore was not one of them.  ************************************    The fact that Chronicles represents the Israelite history in accordance  with the Priestly Code has had the effect of causing its view  of the history to be involuntarily taken as fundamental, but ought much  rather to have caused it to be left altogether out of account where  the object to ascertain what was the real and genuine tradition.  The Books of Judges and Samuel make mention indeed of many sanctuaries,  but never among them of the tabernacle, the most important of all.  For the single passage where the name Ohel Moed occurs (1Samuel  ii.22 is badly attested, and from its contents open to suspicion. /2/    **************************************  2. The passage does not occur in the LXX, and everywhere else in  1Samueli-iii the sanctuary of Shiloh is called hekal, that is to say,  certainly not a tent.  ***************************************    Of the existence of the ark of Jehovah there certainly are distinct traces  towards the end of the period of the judges (compare 1Samuel iv.-vi.)  But is the ark a guarantee of the existence of the tabernacle?  On the contrary its whole history down to the period of its being deposited  in the temple of Solomon is a proof that it was regarded as quite  independent of any tent specially consecrated for its reception.  But this abolishes the notion of the Mosaic tabernacle; for  according to the law, the two things belong necessarily to each  other; the one cannot exist without the other; both are of  equally great importance.  The tabernacle must everywhere  accompany the symbol of its presence; the darkness of the holy  of holies is at the same time the life-element of the ark; only  under compulsion of necessity, and even then not except under the  covering of the curtains, does it leave its lodging during a  march, only to return to it again as soon as the new halting-place  is reached.  But according to 1Samuel iv. seq., on the other hand,  it is only the ark that goes to the campaign; it alone falls into  the hands of the Philistines.  Even in chap. v., where the symbol  of Jehovah is placed in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod, not a word  is said of the tabernacle or of the altar which is necessarily  connected with it; and chap. vi. is equally silent, although  here the enemy plainly gives back the whole of his sacred spoil.  It is assumed that the housing of the ark was left behind at  Shiloh.  Very likely; but that was not the Mosaic tabernacle, the  inseparable companion of the ark.  In fact, the narrator speaks of  a permanent house at Shiloh with doors and doorposts; that  possibly may be an anachronism /1/ (yet why ?) ;    *****************************************  1. Compare similar passages in Josh. vi.19, 24, ix.27, where the very  anachronism shows that the idea of the tabernacle was unknown  to the narrator.  That, moreover. a permanent house did actually exist  then at Shiloh follows from the circumstance that Jeremiah (vii. 12)  speaks of its ruins.  For he could not regard any other than a  pre-Solomonic sanctuary as preceding that of Jerusalem; and  besides, there is not the faintest trace of a more important temple  having arisen at Shiloh within the period of the kings.  *****************************************    but so much at least may be inferred from it that he had not any idea  of the tabernacle, which, however, would have had to go with the ark  to the field.  If on this one occasion only an illegal exception  to the Law was made, why in that case was not the ark, at least after  its surrender, again restored to the lodging from which, strictly  speaking, it ought never to have been separated at all?  Instead of  this it is brought to Bethshemesh, where it causes disaster,  because the people show curiosity about it.  Thence it comes to  Kirjathjearim, where it stays for many years in the house of a  private person.  From here David causes it to be brought to  Jerusalem,-- one naturally supposes, if one thinks in the lines of  the view given in the Pentateuch and in Chronicles, in order that  it may be at last restored to the tabernacle, to be simultaneously  brought to Jerusalem.  But no thought of this, however obvious it  may seem, occurs to the king.  In the first instance, his  intention is to have the ark beside himself in the citadel; but he  is terrified out of this, and, at a loss where else to put it, he  at last places it in the house of one of his principal people,  Obed-Edom of Gath.
