Again G. was bought off by the plaintiff. In the third  case the owner of the horse at first denied having requested G. to  hit the beast, but later admitted the truth. Judgment: G. was to pay  a thousand pieces (which the king gave him) for the injured animal,  but was also to tear out his false accuser's tongue. The fellow gave  G. a sum of money and departed. The fourth decision was as follows:  inasmuch as G. could not restore the dead father to life, he was to  take the dead man's widow to his home and be a father to the young  basket-maker; but he, rather than have his old home broken up, gave  G. a sum of money and hurried away.      It is to be regretted that this Buddhistic birth-story was not known  to Theodor Benfey, who, in his exhaustive discussion of our present  cycle, particularly from the point of view of the \"pound-of-flesh\"  incident (1 : 393-410), writes, \"I may remark that this recital [i.e.,  of the decisions], which here borders on the comic, is based upon  serious traditional legends which have to do with Buddhistic casuistry\"  (p. 397). Benfey's fragmentary citations are not very convincing; but  this Jataka proves that his reasoning, as usual, was entirely sound.    An Indo-Persian version called the \"Kazi of Emessa,\" cited by Clouston  (op. cit.), might be mentioned here, as it too has close resemblances  to our stories.    While a merchant is being taken by a Jew before the king because the  merchant will not pay his bond of a pound of flesh, he meets with  the following accidents: (1) In attempting to stop a runaway mule, he  knocks out one of the animal's eyes with a stone; (2) while sleeping on  a flat roof, he is aroused suddenly by an uproar in the street, and,  jumping from the roof, he kills an old man below; (3) in trying to  pull an ass out of the mud, he pulls its tail off. The owner of the  mule, the sons of the dead man, and the owner of the ass, go along  with the Jew to present their cases before the king, whose decisions  are as follows: (1') The owner of the mule, valued at 1000 dinars,  is to saw the animal in two lengthwise, and is to give the blind  half to the merchant, who must pay 500 dinars for it. As the owner  refuses, he is obliged to pay the merchant 100 dinars for bringing in  a troublesome suit. (2') Merchant must stand below a roof and allow  himself to be jumped on by the sons of the dead man; but they refuse  to take the risk, and are obliged to pay the merchant 100 dinars  for troubling him. (3') The owner of the tailless ass is compelled  to try to pull out the tail of the Kazi's mule. Naturally the animal  resents such treatment, and the accuser is terribly bruised. Finally,  to avoid further punishment, he says that his own animal never had a  tail. Hence he is forced to give the merchant 100 dinars for bringing  in a false suit.      In the \"Katha-sarit-sagara\" (translated by C. H. Tawney, 2 : 180-181)  occurs this story:--    One day, when Brahman Devabhuti had gone to bathe, his wife went into  the garden to get vegetables, and saw a donkey belonging to a washerman  eating them. She took up a stick and ran after the donkey; the animal,  trying to escape, fell into a pit and broke its hoof. When the master  heard of that, he came in a passion, and beat and kicked the Brahman  woman. Accordingly she, being pregnant, had a miscarriage; but the  washerman returned home with his donkey. Her husband, hearing of it,  went, in his distress, and complained to the chief magistrate of the  town. The foolish man, after hearing both sides of the case, delivered  this judgment: \"Since the donkey's hoof is broken, let the Brahman  carry the donkey's load for the washerman until the donkey is again fit  for work; and let the washerman make the Brahman's wife pregnant again,  since he made her miscarry.\" When the Brahman and his wife heard this  decision, they, in their despair, took poison and died; and when the  king heard of it, he put to death that inconsiderate judge.    The Tagalog story of \"How Piro became Rich,\" which I have not printed  here, is identical with \"How Suan became Rich,\" with this exception,  that a horse's tail, instead of a carabao's, is pulled off by the  hero. And there is this addition: while travelling to the king's court,  Piro hears cries for help coming from the woods. He rushes to the spot,  and sees a young lady fighting a swarm of bees. Piro helps kill the  bees with his stick, but, in doing so, injures the woman somewhat  severely. Her father, angered, joins the accusers, and requests the  king that he order Piro to cure his daughter. The king rules that if  Piro is to do this, and if the young woman is to get the best care,  she must become Piro's wife. For relinquishing his right to the girl,  Piro receives a hundred alfonsos from the father.    All in all, the close agreement between our stories and the three  Eastern versions cited above makes it reasonably certain that the  \"Wonderful Decisions\" group in the Philippines derives directly  from India.        TALE 6    THE FOUR BLIND BROTHERS.      Narrated by Eutiqiano Garcia, a Pampangan, who said he heard the  story from a boy from Misamis, Mindanao.      There was once a man who had eight sons. Four of them were blind. He  thought of sending the children away, simply because he could not  afford to keep them in the house any longer. Accordingly one night  he called his eight children together, and said, \"He who does not  provide for the future shall want in the present. You are big enough  and are able to support yourselves. To-morrow I shall send you away  to seek your fortunes.\"    When morning came, the boys bade their father good-by. The blind sons  went together in one party, and the rest in another. Now begins the  pathetic story of the four blind brothers.    They groped along the road, each holding the hand of the other. After  a day of continuous walking, the four brothers were very far away  from their town. They had not tasted food during all that time. In  the evening they came to a cocoanut-grove.    \"Here are some cocoanut-trees,\" said one of them. \"Let us get a bunch  of cocoanuts and have something to eat!\"    So the eldest brother took off his camisa china [22] and climbed up  one of the trees. When he reached the top, the tree broke.    \"Bung!\" Down came the poor fellow. \"One!\" cried the youngest  brother. \"Three more!\" shouted the rest.    \"Don't come down until you have dropped four!\" they all cried at  once. Who would answer them? Their brother lay dead on the ground.    While they were waiting for the second \"Bung!\" the second brother  climbed up the same tree. What had happened to the first happened  also to him, and so to the third in turn. As soon as the youngest  brother heard the third fall, he thought of looking for his share. He  crept about to find the cocoanuts. Alas! he discovered that his three  brothers lay dead on the ground. He went away from the place crying  very loud.    Now, his crying happened to disturb the patianac, [23] who were  trying to sleep. They went out to see what was the matter. When  they found the poor helpless blind man, they were very much moved,  and they gave him food and shelter for the night. They also gave  him the tail of a pagui, [24] which would help him find his fortune,  they said. At daybreak they showed him the way out of the grove.    The blind man walked on and on, until he was hailed by a lame man  resting under a shady tree. \"Friend, carry me on your shoulders,  and let us travel together!\" said the lame man to the blind.    \"Willingly,\" replied the blind man.    They travelled for many hours, and at last came to a big, lonely  house. They knocked at the open door, but nobody answered. At last  they entered, and found the place empty. While they were searching  through the house, the owner came. He was a two-headed giant. The  blind man and the lame man were upstairs.    The giant was afraid to enter the house, but he called in a voice of  thunder, \"Who's there?\"    \"We are big men,\" answered the two companions.    \"How big are you?\" asked the giant.    \"We are so big that the foundation of the house shakes when we walk,\"  the two replied.    \"Give me a proof that you are really big men!\" cried the giant again.    \"We will show you one of our hairs,\" they answered, and they dropped  from the window the tail of the pagui.    The giant looked at it in wonder. He was immediately convinced that  they were more powerful than he was. So, picking up the \"hair,\"  the giant went away, afraid to face such antagonists in single combat.    So the prediction of the patianac came true. The house and all the  property of the giant fell into the hands of the blind man and the  lame man. They lived there happily all the rest of their lives.      Juan the Blind Man.    Narrated by Pedro D. L. Sorreta, a Bicol from Virac, Catanduanes,  where the story is common.    Many years ago there lived in a little village near a thick forest  eight blind men who were close friends. In spite of their physical  defects, they were always happy,--perhaps much happier than their  fellow-villagers, for at night they would always go secretly to one  of the neighboring cocoanut-groves, where they would spend their time  drinking tuba [25] or eating young cocoanuts.    One evening a severe typhoon [26] struck the little village, and most  of the cocoanut-trees were broken off at the top. The next afternoon  the joyous party went to the cocoanut-grove to steal fruits. As soon  as they arrived there, seven of them climbed trees. Juan, the youngest  of all, was ordered to remain below so as to count and gather in the  cocoanuts his friends threw down to him. While his companions were  climbing the trees, Juan was singing,--              \"Eight friends, good friends,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/830"],[0,"The Argonautica (#13)"],[1," current from below was washing against the ship as she moved on, they  went forward sorely in dread; and now the thud of the crashing rocks  ceaselessly struck their ears, and the sea-washed shores resounded,  and then Euphemus grasped the dove in his hand and started to mount the  prow; and they, at the bidding of Tiphys, son of Hagnias, rowed with  good will to drive Argo between the rocks, trusting to their strength.  And as they rounded a bend they saw the rocks opening for the last time  of all. Their spirit melted within them; and Euphemus sent forth the  dove to dart forward in flight; and they all together raised their heads  to look; but she flew between them, and the rocks again rushed together  and crashed as they met face to face. And the foam leapt up in a mass  like a cloud; awful was the thunder of the sea; and all round them the  mighty welkin roared.    (ll. 568-592) The hollow caves beneath the rugged cliffs rumbled as the  sea came surging in; and the white foam of the dashing wave spurted high  above the cliff. Next the current whirled the ship round. And the  rocks shore away the end of the dove's tail-feathers; but away she flew  unscathed. And the rowers gave a loud cry; and Tiphys himself called  to them to row with might and main. For the rocks were again parting  asunder. But as they rowed they trembled, until the tide returning drove  them back within the rocks. Then most awful fear seized upon all; for  over their head was destruction without escape. And now to right and  left broad Pontus was seen, when suddenly a huge wave rose up before  them, arched, like a steep rock; and at the sight they bowed with bended  heads. For it seemed about to leap down upon the ship's whole length and  to overwhelm them. But Tiphys was quick to ease the ship as she laboured  with the oars; and in all its mass the wave rolled away beneath the  keel, and at the stern it raised Argo herself and drew her far away from  the rocks; and high in air was she borne. But Euphemus strode among  all his comrades and cried to them to bend to their oars with all their  might; and they with a shout smote the water. And as far as the ship  yielded to the rowers, twice as far did she leap back, and the oar, were  bent like curved bows as the heroes used their strength.    (ll. 593-610) Then a vaulted billow rushed upon them, and the ship like  a cylinder ran on the furious wave plunging through the hollow sea. And  the eddying current held her between the clashing rocks; and on each  side they shook and thundered; and the ship's timbers were held fast.  Then Athena with her left hand thrust back one mighty rock and with  her right pushed the ship through; and she, like a winged arrow, sped  through the air. Nevertheless the rocks, ceaselessly clashing, shore off  as she passed the extreme end of the stern-ornament. But Athena soared  up to Olympus, when they had escaped unscathed. And the rocks in one  spot at that moment were rooted fast for ever to each other, which thing  had been destined by the blessed gods, when a man in his ship should  have passed between them alive. And the heroes breathed again after  their chilling fear, beholding at the same time the sky and the expanse  of sea spreading far and wide. For they deemed that they were saved from  Hades; and Tiphys first of all began to speak:    (ll. 611-618) \"It is my hope that we have safely escaped this peril--we,  and the ship; and none other is the cause so much as Athena, who  breathed into Argo divine strength when Argus knitted her together with  bolts; and she may not be caught. Son of Aeson, no longer fear thou so  much the hest of thy king, since a god hath granted us escape between  the rocks; for Phineus, Agenor's son, said that our toils hereafter  would be lightly accomplished.\"    (ll. 619-637) He spake, and at once he sped the ship onward through the  midst of the sea past the Bithynian coast. But Jason with gentle words  addressed him in reply: \"Tiphys, why dost thou comfort thus my grieving  heart? I have erred and am distraught in wretched and helpless ruin. For  I ought, when Pelias gave the command, to have straightway refused this  quest to his face, yea, though I were doomed to die pitilessly, torn  limb from limb, but now I am wrapped in excessive fear and cares  unbearable, dreading to sail through the chilling paths of the sea, and  dreading when we shall set foot on the mainland. For on every side are  unkindly men. And ever when day is done I pass a night of groans from  the time when ye first gathered together for my sake, while I take  thought for all things; but thou talkest at thine ease, eating only for  thine own life; while for myself I am dismayed not a whit; but I fear  for this man and for that equally, and for thee, and for my other  comrades, if I shall not bring you back safe to the land of Hellas.\"    (ll. 638-640) Thus he spake, making trial of the chiefs; but they  shouted loud with cheerful words. And his heart was warmed within him at  their cry and again he spake outright among them:    (ll. 641-647) \"My friends, in your valour my courage is quickened.  Wherefore now, even though I should take my way through the gulfs of  Hades, no more shall I let fear seize upon me, since ye are steadfast  amid cruel terrors. But now that we have sailed out from the striking  rocks, I trow that never hereafter will there be another such fearful  thing, if indeed we go on our way following the counsel of Phineus.\"    (ll. 648-668) Thus he spake, and straightway they ceased from such words  and gave unwearying labour to the oar; and quickly they passed by the  swiftly flowing river Rhebas and the peak of Colone, and soon thereafter  the black headland, and near it the mouth of the river Phyllis, where  aforetime Dipsaeus received in his home the son of Athamas, when with  his ram he was flying from the city of Orchomenus; and Dipsacus was the  son of a meadow-nymph, nor was insolence his delight, but contented by  his father's stream he dwelt with his mother, pasturing his flocks by  the shore. And quickly they sighted and sailed past his shrine and the  broad banks of the river and the plain, and deep-flowing Calpe, and all  the windless night and the day they bent to their tireless oars. And  even as ploughing oxen toil as they cleave the moist earth, and sweat  streams in abundance from flank and neck; and from beneath the yoke  their eyes roll askance, while the breath ever rushes from their mouths  in hot gasps; and all day long they toil, planting their hoofs deep in  the ground; like them the heroes kept dragging their oars through the  sea.    (ll. 669-685) Now when divine light has not yet come nor is it utter  darkness, but a faint glimmer has spread over the night, the time when  men wake and call it twilight, at that hour they ran into the harbour of  the desert island Thynias and, spent by weary toil, mounted the shore.  And to them the son of Leto, as he passed from Lycia far away to the  countless folk of the Hyperboreans, appeared; and about his cheeks on  both sides his golden locks flowed in clusters as he moved; in his left  hand he held a silver bow, and on his back was slung a quiver hanging  from his shoulders; and beneath his feet all the island quaked, and the  waves surged high on the beach. Helpless amazement seized them as they  looked; and no one dared to gaze face to face into the fair eyes of the  god. And they stood with heads bowed to the ground; but he, far off,  passed on to the sea through the air; and at length Orpheus spake as  follows, addressing the chiefs:    (ll. 686-693) \"Come, let us call this island the sacred isle of Apollo  of the Dawn since he has appeared to all, passing by at dawn; and we  will offer such sacrifices as we can, building an altar on the shore;  and if hereafter he shall grant us a safe return to the Haemonian land,  then will we lay on his altar the thighs of horned goats. And now I  bid you propitiate him with the steam of sacrifice and libations. Be  gracious, O king, be gracious in thy appearing.\"    (ll. 694-713) Thus he spake, and they straightway built up an altar with  shingle; and over the island they wandered, seeking if haply they could  get a glimpse of a fawn or a wild goat, that often seek their pasture in  the deep wood. And for them Leto's son provided a quarry; and with pious  rites they wrapped in fat the thigh bones of them all and burnt them  on the sacred altar, celebrating Apollo, Lord of Dawn. And round the  burning sacrifice they set up a broad dancing-ring, singing, \"All hail  fair god of healing, Phoebus, all hail,\" and with them Oeagrus' goodly  son began a clear lay on his Bistonian lyre; how once beneath the rocky  ridge of Parnassus he slew with his bow the monster Delphyne, he, still  young and beardless, still rejoicing in his long tresses. Mayst thou be  gracious! Ever, O king, be thy locks unshorn, ever unravaged; for so is  it right. And none but Leto, daughter of Coeus, strokes them with her  dear hands. And often the Corycian nymphs, daughters of Pleistus, took  up the cheering strain crying \"Healer\"; hence arose this lovely refrain  of the hymn to Phoebus.    (ll. 714-719) Now when they had celebrated him with dance and song they  took an oath with holy libations, that they would ever help each other  with concord of heart, touching the sacrifice as they swore; and even  now there stands there a temple to gracious Concord, which the heroes  themselves reared, paying honour at that time to the glorious goddess.    (ll. 720-751) Now when the third morning came, with a fresh west wind  they left the lofty island. Next, on the opposite side they saw and  passed the mouth of the river Sangarius and the fertile land of the  Mariandyni, and the stream of Lycus and the Anthemoeisian lake; and  beneath the breeze the ropes and all the tackling quivered as they sped  onward.
