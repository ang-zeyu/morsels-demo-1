In my turn I took out my pocket handkerchief and bound it round his  head which pleased him very much, and we became from the moment the best  of friends. I invited him on board the boat, and he readily accepted my  invitation. When on board he was called to from the woods on the opposite  shore by a number of voices which surprised us a little as we did not  expect they were in such numbers. My new acquaintance called out in his  turn to those on shore, and their cries immediately ceased. I have reason  to think...that he assured them he had nothing to fear, which quieted  their alarm.    \"Proceeding further we saw a flock of ducks and I ordered one of the  people to fire which he did and was lucky enough to kill two. Never did I  witness stronger marks of surprise than were depicted on the stranger's  countenance when he heard the report of the gun and saw the two ducks  fall into the water. His astonishment was increased when he got on board  the vessel; everything...seemed to fill him with wonder and amazement.  During the time he stayed on board he never quitted my side, and at the  hour of rest he laid himself down near my bed place. I presented him with  a small tomahawk which pleased him very much and he pronounced with much  earnestness the word...'Mogo.' He readily ate of whatever was set before  him; spirits he would not touch, but sugar he took freely. He endeavoured  to repeat our words after us; and was infinitely more tractable than the  native last described. He was an elderly man, short in stature but well  made; his arms and legs were long in proportion to his body which was  slender and straight. Having occasion to despatch my first mate in a boat  to Colonel Paterson I took that opportunity of sending off my New  Hollander with directions that he should be landed on the precise spot  from whence he was taken...When the first mate was returning he was  surprised to find his passenger of the day before on the banks, who  begged to be permitted to return to the vessel with him; he had a young  lad with him whom he desired might accompany him and they were both  brought on board. This lad made me understand that he wished to have a  mogo and I soon found that I could not make a more acceptable present to  a native...    \"On the 19th we were rejoined by Colonel Paterson with the whole of his  party. The Colonel had explored a branch of the river on the banks of  which he found a species of flax growing which he thought was valuable.  He had collected specimens of many rare and uncommon plants particularly  some varieties of fern, but unfortunately was deprived of the fruits of  his industry. His servant had made use of the bundle of plants as a  pillow and having placed it too near the fire it was soon in a blaze, and  he was awaked only in time to save his face from being scorched...    \"We were now growing short of provisions and no vessel arriving from  Sydney we set about making preparations for our return thither. There was  now a small establishment made for the colliers.* (* At Collier's Point.)  I had built them a convenient hut to shelter them. I left them a boat and  seine with what provisions I was able to spare. We took our departure for  Sydney on the 22nd of July 1801, and arrived there on the 25th.\"    Six weeks after his return to port, Grant sent in his resignation on the  ground that he had so \"little knowledge of nautical surveying.\" The  resignation was accepted by King, who wrote in reply: \"I should have been  glad if your ability as a surveyor or being able to determine the  longitude of the different places you might visit was in anyway equal to  your ability as an officer or a seaman.\"    A very slight perusal of Grant's narrative of his voyage enables us to  grasp the state of his feelings when he sent in his resignation. It is  evident that he thought he had not been treated fairly, and was glad to  quit New South Wales. He writes of his departure: \"The mortifications and  disappointments I met with...induced me to seize the first opportunity of  leaving the country.\" And it seems possible that when he told King that  he had no knowledge of \"nautical surveying,\" he said so because he knew  King thought he had not, and it looks as if the admission was made as a  pretext to obtain his passage to England, rather than for the purpose of  belittling his own capabilities. That Grant was a fine seaman goes  without saying. That he was personally courageous, his subsequent naval  services proved. He seems to have handled his ship at all times with  extraordinary care, and it may have been that he had studied marine  surveying with less assiduity than seamanship, for the chart that he made  must be admitted to be very imperfect.    Murray, his successor in the command of the brig, is best remembered as  the discoverer of Victoria, and \"yet,\" writes Rusden, \"he (Murray) merely  obeyed a distinct order in going thither to trace the coast between Point  Schanck and Cape Albany Otway noticing the soundings and everything  remarkable.\" Rusden might have added, that Murray probably received some  benefit from Grant's experiences, for at that time he was equally  incompetent as a marine surveyor. It is Flinders who has credited Grant  with the discovery of the coast of Victoria \"as far as Cape Schanck,\" and  Flinders was most competent to judge as to whom the honour should belong.  On the great seaman's chart published in 1814 (Terra Australis, by M.  Flinders, South Coast, Sheet 5) is inscribed, \"Coast as far as Cape  Schanck discovered by Captain James Grant, 1800,\" in which track, of  course, is included the entrance to Port Phillip, although Flinders knew  that Grant had not penetrated to the bay itself.    Grant sailed from Sydney in the Anna Josepha, Captain Maclean, an old  Spanish brig, belonging to Mr. Simeon Lord. She had been taken off the  coast of Peru by the Betsy whaler, and on her arrival at Sydney was  renamed Anna Josepha in honour of the Governor's wife. Loaded with coals  and spars, the ship left Port Jackson for the Cape of Good Hope on  November 9th, 1801. She steered southward of New Zealand, made Cape Horn,  and then sailed to the Falklands. Grant quitted her when she reached  Tristan D'Acunha and obtained a passage in the Ocean as far as Table Bay.  There he shipped on April 12th, 1802, in H.M.S. Imperieuse for England,  where he arrived safely, and, in due course, reported himself to the  Admiralty.    Three years later he obtained his rank of Commander on January 12th,  1805, with a pension for gallantry in a spirited action off Holland, when  in command of the Hawke cutter he was badly wounded. He subsequently  commanded the Raven and Thracian and died at St. Servan in 1833, aged 61.      CHAPTER 4.    MURRAY APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE LADY NELSON: HIS VOYAGE TO NORFOLK  ISLAND.    On Grant's resigning the command of the Lady Nelson, Governor King  appointed John Murray to succeed him. As has been told Murray had  formerly been Master's mate of the Porpoise and had accompanied Grant  when he went for the second time to try and explore Governor King's Bay,  and the Governor apparently thought him a capable officer. His  appointment is dated September 3rd, 1801, so that he seems to have taken  over the new post about two months before his predecessor finally left  Sydney.    When, however, the Lady Nelson sailed to the Hawkesbury in September to  load the settlers' grain and to bring it to Sydney, Grant appears to have  been still on board her, as he was enjoined to ensure her safety at that  place by Governor King. \"You are not to leave the vessel yourself or  suffer any other person to leave her while in the river nor let any  strangers or visitors go on board...Your board netting is to be kept up  while in the river.\" King evidently was determined to guard against the  capture of the brig by runaway convicts, a fate which had overtaken the  Norfolk. Murray succeeded to the command of the brig on her return from  this Hawkesbury trip. His first voyage was to Norfolk Island, when he  carried orders and instructions from the Governor of New South Wales to  Major Foveaux, the Lieutenant-Governor. Before leaving Sydney, Captain  Abbott, Ensign Piper and Mr. John Roberts (surgeon's mate) were embarked  as passengers on board the Lady Nelson, and in the afternoon of October  1st she set sail for her destination. The following account of her voyage  is extracted from the log:--    H.M.A. SURVEYING VESSEL LADY NELSON.    From Port Jackson to Norfolk Island.    \"October 2nd, 1801. At 3 P.M. got under weigh and stood out of ye Heads.  Observed ye Porpoise to be in the offing. At 5 P.M. passed under the  stern of the Porpoise and Mr. Murray went on board and waited on ye  Commander of that vessel. At 6 Lieutenant Murray returned on board,  hoisted in our gig and gave the Porpoise three cheers, which was  returned--made sail at half-past 6 P.M.--ye North Head of Port Jackson  bore to west by north distant 6 miles, the South Head of Broken Bay bore  north by west distance 6 leagues.    \"Saturday, October 3rd.

And now the several divisions were in motion, the  glittering of arms was beheld, while the most daring and impetuous  were hurrying to the front, and the line of battle was forming; when  Agricola, although his soldiers were in high spirits, and scarcely to  be kept within their intrenchments, kindled additional ardor by these  words:--    \"It is now the eighth year, my fellow-soldiers, in which, under the high  auspices of the Roman empire, by your valor and perseverance you have  been conquering Britain. In so many expeditions, in so many battles,  whether you have been required to exert your courage against the enemy,  or your patient labors against the very nature of the country, neither  have I ever been dissatisfied with my soldiers, nor you with your  general. In this mutual confidence, we have proceeded beyond the limits  of former commanders and former armies; and are now become acquainted  with the extremity of the island, not by uncertain rumor, but by actual  possession with our arms and encampments. Britain is discovered and  subdued. How often on a march, when embarrassed with mountains, bogs  and rivers, have I heard the bravest among you exclaim, 'When shall  we descry the enemy? when shall we be led to the field of battle?' At  length they are unharbored from their retreats; your wishes and your  valor have now free scope; and every circumstance is equally propitious  to the victor, and ruinous to the vanquished. For, the greater our glory  in having marched over vast tracts of land, penetrated forests, and  crossed arms of the sea, while advancing towards the foe, the greater  will be our danger and difficulty if we should attempt a retreat. We are  inferior to our enemies in knowledge of the country, and less able to  command supplies of provision; but we have arms in our hands, and in  these we have everything. For myself, it has long been my principle,  that a retiring general or army is never safe. Hot only, then, are we to  reflect that death with honor is preferable to life with ignominy, but  to remember that security and glory are seated in the same place. Even  to fall in this extremest verge of earth and of nature cannot be thought  an inglorious fate.    34. \"If unknown nations or untried troops were drawn up against you, I  would exhort you from the example of other armies. At present, recollect  your own honors, question your own eyes. These are they, who, the last  year, attacking by surprise a single legion in the obscurity of the  night, were put to flight by a shout: the greatest fugitives of all the  Britons, and therefore the longest survivors. As in penetrating woods  and thickets the fiercest animals boldly rush on the hunters, while the  weak and timorous fly at their very noise; so the bravest of the Britons  have long since fallen: the remaining number consists solely of the  cowardly and spiritless; whom you see at length within your reach, not  because they have stood their ground, but because they are overtaken.  Torpid with fear, their bodies are fixed and chained down in yonder  field, which to you will speedily be the scene of a glorious and  memorable victory. Here bring your toils and services to a conclusion;  close a struggle of fifty years [118] with one great day; and convince  your country-men, that to the army ought not to be imputed either the  protraction of war, or the causes of rebellion.\"    35. Whilst Agricola was yet speaking, the ardor of the soldiers declared  itself; and as soon as he had finished, they burst forth into cheerful  acclamations, and instantly flew to arms. Thus eager and impetuous, he  formed them so that the centre was occupied by the auxiliary infantry,  in number eight thousand, and three thousand horse were spread in the  wings. The legions were stationed in the rear, before the intrenchments;  a disposition which would render the victory signally glorious, if  it were obtained without the expense of Roman blood; and would ensure  support if the rest of the army were repulsed. The British troops, for  the greater display of their numbers, and more formidable appearance,  were ranged upon the rising grounds, so that the first line stood upon  the plain, the rest, as if linked together, rose above one another upon  the ascent. The charioteers [119] and horsemen filled the middle of the  field with their tumult and careering. Then Agricola, fearing from the  superior number of the enemy lest he should be obliged to fight as  well on his flanks as in front, extended his ranks; and although this  rendered his line of battle less firm, and several of his officers  advised him to bring up the legions, yet, filled with hope, and resolute  in danger, he dismissed his horse and took his station on foot before  the colors.    36. At first the action was carried on at a distance. The Britons, armed  with long swords and short targets, [120] with steadiness and dexterity  avoided or struck down our missile weapons, and at the same time poured  in a torrent of their own. Agricola then encouraged three Batavian and  two Tungrian [121] cohorts to fall in and come to close quarters; a  method of fighting familiar to these veteran soldiers, but embarrassing  to the enemy from the nature of their armor; for the enormous British  swords, blunt at the point, are unfit for close grappling, and engaging  in a confined space. When the Batavians; therefore, began to redouble  their blows, to strike with the bosses of their shields, and mangle the  faces of the enemy; and, bearing down all those who resisted them on  the plain, were advancing their lines up the ascent; the other cohorts,  fired with ardor and emulation, joined in the charge, and overthrew all  who came in their way: and so great was their impetuosity in the pursuit  of victory, that they left many of their foes half dead or unhurt behind  them. In the meantime the troops of cavalry took to flight, and the  armed chariots mingled in the engagement of the infantry; but although  their first shock occasioned some consternation, they were soon  entangled among the close ranks of the cohorts, and the inequalities  of the ground. Not the least appearance was left of an engagement of  cavalry; since the men, long keeping their ground with difficulty, were  forced along with the bodies of the horses; and frequently, straggling  chariots, and affrighted horses without their riders, flying variously  as terror impelled them, rushed obliquely athwart or directly through  the lines. [122]    37. Those of the Britons who, yet disengaged from the fight, sat on the  summits of the hills, and looked with careless contempt on the smallness  of our numbers, now began gradually to descend; and would have fallen on  the rear of the conquering troops, had not Agricola, apprehending this  very event, opposed four reserved squadron of horse to their attack,  which, the more furiously they had advanced, drove them back with the  greater celerity. Their project was thus turned against themselves; and  the squadrons were ordered to wheel from the front of the battle  and fall upon the enemy's rear. A striking and hideous spectacle  now appeared on the plain: some pursuing; some striking: some making  prisoners, whom they slaughtered as others came in their way. Now, as  their several dispositions prompted, crowds of armed Britons fled before  inferior numbers, or a few, even unarmed, rushed upon their foes,  and offered themselves to a voluntary death. Arms, and carcasses, and  mangled limbs, were promiscuously strewed, and the field was dyed in  blood. Even among the vanquished were seen instances of rage and valor.  When the fugitives approached the woods, they collected, and surrounded  the foremost of the pursuers, advancing incautiously, and unacquainted  with the country; and had not Agricola, who was everywhere present,  caused some strong and lightly-equipped cohorts to encompass the ground,  while part of the cavalry dismounted made way through the thickets,  and part on horseback scoured the open woods, some disaster would have  proceeded from the excess of confidence. But when the enemy saw their  pursuers again formed in compact order, they renewed their flight, not  in bodies as before, or waiting for their companions, but scattered  and mutually avoiding each other; and thus took their way to the most  distant and devious retreats. Night and satiety of slaughter put an end  to the pursuit. Of the enemy ten thousand were slain: on our part three  hundred and sixty fell; among whom was Aulus Atticus, the praefect of a  cohort, who, by his juvenile ardor, and the fire of his horse, was borne  into the midst of the enemy.    38. Success and plunder contributed to render the night joyful to the  victors; whilst the Britons, wandering and forlorn, amid the promiscuous  lamentations of men and women, were dragging along the wounded; calling  out to the unhurt; abandoning their habitations, and in the rage of  despair setting them on fire; choosing places of concealment, and then  deserting them; consulting together, and then separating. Sometimes, on  beholding the dear pledges of kindred and affection, they were melted  into tenderness, or more frequently roused into fury; insomuch that  several, according to authentic information, instigated by a savage  compassion, laid violent hands upon their own wives and children. On the  succeeding day, a vast silence all around, desolate hills, the distant  smoke of burning houses, and not a living soul descried by the scouts,  displayed more amply the face of victory. After parties had been  detached to all quarters without discovering any certain tracks of the  enemy's flight, or any bodies of them still in arms, as the lateness  of the season rendered it impracticable to spread the war through the  country, Agricola led his "]]]
