Soon after the conference my brother and myself commenced our  journey without any means to bear our expenses. We travelled  through the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri, in the  midst of the heat of summer on foot, and faithfully preached the  gospel in many parts of all these States. We suffered the hardships  incident to a new and, in many places, unsettled country, such as  hunger, thirst, fatigue, etc. We arrived in upper Missouri in  September, having baptized many people and organized branches of  the Church in several parts of Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. On our  arrival we found a considerable settlement of the brethren from  Ohio, who had immigrated during the summer and taken up their  residence in Jackson County. President Smith, and many of the  Elders, had been there and held a conference, and, having organized  a Stake of Zion, pointed out and consecrated certain grounds for a  city and temple, they had again returned to the East. With them,  the brethren whom I had left there the previous winter, had also  returned.    I felt somewhat disappointed in not meeting with the brethren;  but was consoled with the reflection that I had been diligent in  preaching the gospel on my journey, while others had hurried  through the country, perhaps, without tarrying to do much good.    I was now taken sick with the fever and ague, owing to the  exposures of the climate through which we had travelled. I suffered  extremely for several months; being brought very low with fever,  and with other afflictions.    I tarried mostly with a branch of the Church commonly called the  Colesville branch. They had removed from Colesville, in the State  of New York, and settled on the borders of a fertile prairie, about  twelve miles west of the village of Independence, and near the  boundaries which divide the State of Missouri from the Indian  Territory. They consisted of about sixty souls, and were under the  presidency of a faithful and zealous Elder by the name of Newel  Knight--an account of whose miraculous conversion we here record,  as extracted from the life of Joseph Smith, published in the  _Millennial Star_, Vol. 4, p. 116:    \"During this month of April, I (Joseph Smith) went on a visit to  the residence of Mr. Joseph Knight, of Colesville, Broom County,  N.Y., with whom and his family I had been previously acquainted,  and whose name I have above mentioned as having been so kind and  thoughtful towards us while translating the Book of Mormon. Mr.  Knight and his family were Universalists; but were willing to  reason with me upon my religious views, and were, as usual,  friendly and hospitable. We held several meetings in the  neighborhood; we had many friends and some enemies. Our meetings  were well attended, and many began to pray fervently to Almighty  God that He would give them wisdom to understand the truth. Among  those who attended our meetings regularly was Newel Knight, son of  Joseph Knight. He and I had many serious conversations on the  important subject of man's eternal salvation. We were in the habit  of praying much at our meetings, and Newel had said that he would  try and take up his cross and pray vocally during meeting; but when  we again met together he rather excused himself. I tried to prevail  upon him, making use of the figure, supposing that he should get  into a mud hole would he not try to help himself out? And that we  were willing now to help him out of the mud hole. He replied, 'that  provided he had got into a mud hole through carelessness, he would  rather wait and get out himself than have others to help him, and  so he would wait until he should get into the woods by himself and  there he would pray.' Accordingly he deferred praying until next  morning, when he retired into the woods, where, according to his  own account afterwards, he made several attempts to pray, but could  scarcely do so--feeling that he had not done his duty, but that he  should have prayed in the presence of others. He began to feel  uneasy, and continued to feel worse both in mind and body until,  upon reaching his own house, his appearance was such as to alarm  his wife very much. He requested her to go and bring me to him. I  went and found him suffering very much in his mind, and his body  acted upon in a very strange manner. His visage and limbs distorted  and twisted in every shape and appearance possible to imagine; and  finally, he was caught up off the floor of the apartment and tossed  about most fearfully. His situation was soon made known to his  neighbors and relatives, and in a short time as many as eight or  nine grown persons had got together to witness the scene. After he  had thus suffered for a time, I succeeded in getting hold of him by  the hand, when almost immediately he spoke to me, and with very  great earnestness requested of me that I should cast the devil out  of him; saying, 'that he knew that he was in him, and that he also  knew that I could cast him out.' I replied, 'if you know that I can  it shall be done,' and then, almost unconsciously, I rebuked the  devil, and commanded him in the name of Jesus Christ to depart from  him' when immediately Newel spoke out and said, 'that he saw the  devil leave him and vanish from his sight.'*    [Footnote] *This was the first miracle which was done in this  Church, or by any member of it, and it was not done by man nor the  power of man, but it was done by God, and by the power of  godliness; therefore, let the honor and the praise, the dominion  and the glory, be ascribed to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, for  ever and ever. Amen.    \"The scene was now entirely changed; for as soon as the devil  had departed from our friend his countenance became natural; his  distortions of body ceased; and almost immediately the Spirit of  the Lord descended upon him, and the visions of eternity were  opened to his view. He afterwards related his experience as  follows:    \"'I now began to feel a most pleasing sensation resting upon me,  and immediately the visions of Heaven were opened to my view. I  felt myself attracted upward, and remained for some time enrapt in  contemplation, insomuch that I knew not what was going on in the  room. By-and-by I felt some weight pressing upon my shoulder and  the side of my head, which served to recall me to a sense of my  situation, and I found that the Spirit of the Lord had actually  caught me up off the floor, and that my shoulder and head were  pressing against the beams.'    \"All this was witnessed by many, to their great astonishment and  satisfaction, when they saw the devil thus cast out and the power  of God and His Holy Spirit thus made manifest. So soon as  consciousness returned, his bodily weakness was such that we were  obliged to lay him upon his bed and wait upon him for some time. As  may be expected, such a scene as this contributed much to make  believers of those who witnessed it; and, finally, the greater part  of them became members of the Church.\"    This Colesville branch was among the first organized by Joseph  Smith, and constituted the first settlers of the members of the  Church in Missouri. They had arrived late in the summer, and cut  some hay for their cattle, sowed a little grain, and prepared some  ground for cultivation, and were engaged during the fall and winter  in building log cabins, etc. The winter was cold, and for some time  about ten families lived in one log cabin, which was open and  unfinished, while the frozen ground served for a floor. Our food  consisted of beef and a little bread made of corn, which had been  grated into coarse meal by rubbing the ears on a tin grater. This  was rather an inconvenient way of living for a sick person; but it  was for the gospel's sake, and all were very cheerful and happy.    We enjoyed many happy seasons in our prayer and other meetings,  and the Spirit of the Lord was poured out upon us, and even on the  little children, insomuch that many of eight, ten or twelve years  of age spake, and prayed, and prophesied in our meetings and in our  family worship. There was a spirit of peace and union, and love and  good will manifested in this little Church in the wilderness, the  memory of which will be ever dear to my heart.    It was during my long illness in this dreary winter that I had  the following dream or vision: I thought I saw myself dressed in a  clean and beautiful linen robe, white as snow, and extending from  the neck downward in beautiful folds. On either breast were lines  of golden writing, in large Roman letters, about a third of an inch  in length, and the lines extending from the center of the breast on  each side six or eight inches long. The upper line on each side  appeared larger and more beautiful or conspicuous than the others;  one of these lines was: \"HOLY PROPHET,\" and the other was: \"NEW  JERUSALEM.\"    On awaking from this dream I immediately called to mind the  words of the Saviour to John the Revelator: \"_He that overcometh  will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no  more out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the  name of the City of my God, which is New Jerusalem_.\"    This dream certainly encouraged me, and enabled me to bear my  sickness, privation and long absence from my wife and former  friends more patiently.

Some time in February, 1832, a Conference was held by Bishop  Partridge and the Elders remaining in this part of the country. To  this Conference I was determined to go, though very feeble"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/449"],[0,"Pathology of Lying, Accusation, and Swindling: A Study in Forensic Psychology (#13)"],[1," Here she produced more blood as if from a pulmonary  hemorrhage and more symptoms were recounted, but the doctors  decided after careful examination that she was falsifying.  Her  illness ceased the minute she was told to leave the hospital.  Matters were serious, for Inez was now without home, money, or  relatives.  She was once more taken under protection and greater  effort was made to trace her family.  They were discovered  through letters containing remittances sent by Inez herself from  Iowa, after years of silence.  Much of her career was soon  brought to light.  By this time, we may note, several observers  had insisted that from a commonsense standpoint the girl  certainly was insane.    While affairs were being looked up, Inez conferred with us from  time to time.  She started by telling a thoroughly good story,  the general import of which was the same as she told months  previously, but there were differences in many details.  In the  first place she still insisted she was 17 years old and gave us  an exact date as her birthday-- this was in response to the mild  suggestion that she might be considerably older.  Since her  letters, although showing very good choice of words, were  incorrectly punctuated, we inquired further about her education.  She said she had received 18 credits in a noted girls' seminary  in the south, but later reversed this and stated she had very  little education.  She told us her experiences of the last few  months when she had been introducing literary works in the towns  of Iowa.  She had done well for a beginner at this, we found from  other sources, but had made misrepresentations and had talked too  freely, against her employers' wishes and advice.  Finally she  had sent in forged orders.  This was quite unnecessary, for her  salary was assured and sufficient, and her employers had regarded  her as an extremely promising representative.  In Iowa she was  receiving mail under two different names; she still found it  convenient to represent herself sometimes as Agnes W.  In her  peregrinations she had again made close friends with some  substantial people, who found out, however, in short order that  she was untruthful, and her chances with them were at once  spoiled.    In the next weeks, when under observation, Inez varied her story  from time to time even with the same persons.  She was now 17 and  now 19 years old.  She had an operation first in one town and  then it was in another.  Her antecedents in many particulars  varied from time to time.  Inez seemed to have lost her desire or  ability to be consistent, and in particular appeared to have no  conception of the effect upon the adjustment of her own case  which her continual lying was likely to have.  (At this time  again some non-professional observers insisted strenuously that  Inez was insane.  They based their opinion upon the fact that she  showed so little apperceptive ability, so little judgment in  relating the results of her continual lying to its necessary  effect upon her career.)  It requires too much space to go over  the complicated details of her many stories, but some of her  expressions and behavior are worth noting.    We always found Inez most friendly, sometimes voluble, and she  ever dealt with us in a lady-like manner.  Again we noted that  many a society woman would give much for her well modulated voice  and powers of verbal expression.  Without any suggestion of  melodrama she would rise to strong passages in giving vent to her  feelings of indignation and ambition.  At this time we were still  wondering where she could have obtained her education; it was not  until later that we comprehended that her abilities represented  sheer native traits.    She first came to us much hurt because a certain official had  warned her, after one of her simulating episodes in a hospital,  never to deceive again.  ``My trying to get sympathy!  I don't  want any sympathy.  I told her I was independent and always  wanted to make my own way in the world.  If they thought I wasn't  sick in the hospital why didn't they say so.  The doctor told me  to stay in bed.    ``Doctor, yes, I did lie to you about my age before; why  shouldn't I?  I have been deceived on all sides and have found  that people are against me.  If they want to leave me alone, they  can get the truth, but when one is deceived one has to tell lies  sometimes.  I've had many troubles.  Oh, doctor, if you knew what  I've been through and what's in my heart you'd think I do pretty  well.  I would rather starve than have it cast up to me that I  had asked for any body's help or sympathy.  I want to make my own  way.  I must have an education.  In September I plan to go to the  M. Academy and work my way through.  I am just past 18 now.    ``The B.'s are ashamed of me I suppose.  I ran away from them.  They are refined people.  But I can't be treated in that way.  They adopted me.  They said that I got some money dishonestly,  but, doctor, it is not in me to be bad.  I feel that through and  through.    ``Well, I know that I'm a Yankee by birth, on both sides.  My  people came from Mayflower stock.  I will make my way in the  world, I will succeed, and you'll see, doctor.  I will have an  education.  As to going back to the Johnsons, I would commit  suicide rather than do that.  It was not true that I had a good  education as I told you.  They did not treat me well.  They can  write as they please and talk about forgiveness for what I have  done, but it is they who were cruel and abusive.  Suppose they do  say I'm their child.  I know I am not because I was not treated  the same as the others.  I was 12 or 13 when I ran away from  them.  How could I belong to the family?  They are all so much  older than I am.''    Inez now gave us, most curiously, some addresses which opened up  knowledge of her career over several years.  But what she told us  about these new people was directly denied by return mail.  At  one interview her first words were, ``Do you know now, doctor,  that I was in a State hospital?''  Having made this challenging  statement she went no further, merely involved herself in  contradictions as to the place, and would say nothing more than  that she had once suffered from an attack of nervous prostration.  She absolutely denied items of information about herself which we  had gradually accumulated, and this type of reaction obtained all  the way through our last period of acquaintance with Inez, even  after we had the detailed facts about her early life from her  parents.    Inez never lost an opportunity to impress upon people whom she  did not regard as her equals that she considered herself much of  a lady and quite above housework.  On one occasion, when held as  a runaway girl, she had a terrible outbreak of temper simply  because she was asked to clear the dinner table.  This was no  momentary affair.  Her recalcitrancy was kept up the larger part  of one day, and she made the place almost unbearable that night  by screaming and moaning.  Telling me about the incident, she  said it was because she would not allow herself to cater to such  people.  ``If a person asks me, I may do things, but nobody can  tell me to.  I would not give in.  I would not do it.''    To some of us it has seemed highly significant that at moments  which would ordinarily be expected to bring out great emotion  Inez showed almost none.  For instance, when going to an  important interview about the disposition of her case, she first  plaintively said she did not know what to say, and then  immediately began to dwell with evident pleasure upon the costume  of the person addressing her.  Many normal emotions were seen  expressed, however, and many moral sentiments were undoubtedly  held, but there seemed to be curious displacements upon these  levels of her mental life; there was faulty mental  stratification.  Probably the force which caused this is  egocentrism.      In relating what we now know of the past history of this case we  shall put together that which we have heard from many different  sources.  There is no question about all the important  facts--correspondents largely corroborate each other.    Inez came from a family of French extraction, apparently stable  and normal tradespeople.  The old mother at 74 years wrote us an  unusually well-thought-out, detailed account of her daughter's  early life.  The paternal grandfather was insane and an aunt had  epilepsy.  Defective heredity in other respects is denied.  We  get no history of convulsions in the immediate family, nor of any  other neurotic manifestation, except that one sister is ``very  excitable.''    Inez came when the mother was unusually advanced in life, and the  brothers and sisters, of whom there were five, had long since  been born.  There was a difference of 10 years between Inez and  the next older.  In telling the facts, the mother dwells much on  this and the bearing which her chagrin during pregnancy may have  had upon the girl's physical and mental development.  She was  born, then, after a troubled pregnancy, a weak and sickly child,  ``almost like a skeleton.''    Inez was rather slow at walking, but at one year spoke her first  words.  We do not know with accuracy about the earliest factors  in the mental environment.  (Inez has told various stories about  early family friction, and even about contracting an infection at  home, much of which seems highly conjectural.)  Between the ages  of 7 and 10 several sicknesses, diphtheria, measles with some  cardiac complication, etc., kept her much out of school.  Part of  the time she lived in New Orleans, and part of the time in a  country district.  She only went to school until she was 14, and  was somewhat retarded on account of changing about and illnesses.  However, it is said she always liked her school and showed fair  aptitude for study.  At 14 she returned to New Orleans and,  desiring to be a dressmaker,"]]]
