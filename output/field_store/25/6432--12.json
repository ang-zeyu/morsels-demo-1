It has been so for a long time.' . . . 'You  said that.' . . . 'No, I did not say that.' . . . 'Then I lie?' etc.    \"And I felt that the frightful crisis was approaching when I should  desire to kill her or else myself. I knew that it was approaching; I  was afraid of it as of fire; I wanted to restrain myself. But rage  took possession of my whole being. My wife found herself in the same  condition, perhaps worse. She knew that she intentionally distorted each  of my words, and each of her words was saturated with venom. All that  was dear to me she disparaged and profaned. The farther the quarrel  went, the more furious it became. I cried, 'Be silent,' or something  like that.    \"She bounded out of the room and ran toward the children. I tried to hold  her back to finish my insults. I grasped her by the arm, and hurt her.  She cried: 'Children, your father is beating me.' I cried: 'Don't lie.'  She continued to utter falsehoods for the simple purpose of irritating  me further. 'Ah, it is not the first time,' or something of that sort.  The children rushed toward her and tried to quiet her. I said: 'Don't  sham.' She said: 'You look upon everything as a sham. You would kill a  person and say he was shamming. Now I understand you. That is what you  want to do.' 'Oh, if you were only dead!' I cried.    \"I remember how that terrible phrase frightened me. Never had I thought  that I could utter words so brutal, so frightful, and I was stupefied at  what had just escaped my lips. I fled into my private apartment. I sat  down and began to smoke. I heard her go into the hall and prepare to go  out. I asked her: 'Where are you going? She did not answer. 'Well, may  the devil take you!' said I to myself, going back into my private room,  where I lay down again and began smoking afresh. Thousands of plans of  vengeance, of ways of getting rid of her, and how to arrange this, and  act as if nothing had happened,--all this passed through my head. I  thought of these things, and I smoked, and smoked, and smoked. I thought  of running away, of making my escape, of going to America. I went so far  as to dream how beautiful it would be, after getting rid of her, to love  another woman, entirely different from her. I should be rid of her if  she should die or if I should get a divorce, and I tried to think how  that could be managed. I saw that I was getting confused, but, in order  not to see that I was not thinking rightly, I kept on smoking.    \"And the life of the house went on as usual. The children's teacher came  and asked: 'Where is Madame? When will she return?'    \"The servants asked if they should serve the tea. I entered the  dining-room. The children, Lise, the eldest girl, looked at me with  fright, as if to question me, and she did not come. The whole evening  passed, and still she did not come. Two sentiments kept succeeding each  other in my soul,--hatred of her, since she tortured myself and the  children by her absence, but would finally return just the same, and  fear lest she might return and make some attempt upon herself. But where  should I look for her? At her sister's? It seemed so stupid to go to ask  where one's wife is. Moreover, may God forbid, I hoped, that she should  be at her sister's! If she wishes to torment any one, let her torment  herself first. And suppose she were not at her sister's.    \"Suppose she were to do, or had already done, something.    \"Eleven o'clock, midnight, one o'clock. . . . I did not sleep. I did not  go to my chamber. It is stupid to lie stretched out all alone, and to  wait. But in my study I did not rest. I tried to busy myself, to write  letters, to read. Impossible! I was alone, tortured, wicked, and  I listened. Toward daylight I went to sleep. I awoke. She had not  returned. Everything in the house went on as usual, and all looked at  me in astonishment, questioningly. The children's eyes were full of  reproach for me.    \"And always the same feeling of anxiety about her, and of hatred because  of this anxiety.    \"Toward eleven o'clock in the morning came her sister, her ambassadress.  Then began the usual phrases: 'She is in a terrible state. What is  the matter?' 'Why, nothing has happened.' I spoke of her asperity of  character, and I added that I had done nothing, and that I would not  take the first step. If she wants a divorce, so much the better! My  sister-in-law would not listen to this idea, and went away without  having gained anything. I was obstinate, and I said boldly and  determinedly, in talking to her, that I would not take the first  step. Immediately she had gone I went into the other room, and saw the  children in a frightened and pitiful state, and there I found myself  already inclined to take this first step. But I was bound by my word.  Again I walked up and down, always smoking. At breakfast I drank brandy  and wine, and I reached the point which I unconsciously desired, the  point where I no longer saw the stupidity and baseness of my situation.    \"Toward three o'clock she came. I thought that she was appeased, or  admitted her defeat. I began to tell her that I was provoked by her  reproaches. She answered me, with the same severe and terribly downcast  face, that she had not come for explanations, but to take the children,  that we could not live together. I answered that it was not my fault,  that she had put me beside myself. She looked at me with a severe and  solemn air, and said: 'Say no more. You will repent it.' I said that I  could not tolerate comedies. Then she cried out something that I did not  understand, and rushed toward her room. The key turned in the lock,  and she shut herself up. I pushed at the door. There was no response.  Furious, I went away.    \"A half hour later Lise came running all in tears. 'What! Has anything  happened? We cannot hear Mamma!' We went toward my wife's room. I pushed  the door with all my might. The bolt was scarcely drawn, and the door  opened. In a skirt, with high boots, my wife lay awkwardly on the bed.  On the table an empty opium phial. We restored her to life. Tears and  then reconciliation! Not reconciliation; internally each kept the hatred  for the other, but it was absolutely necessary for the moment to end  the scene in some way, and life began again as before. These scenes, and  even worse, came now once a week, now every month, now every day. And  invariably the same incidents. Once I was absolutely resolved to fly,  but through some inconceivable weakness I remained.    \"Such were the circumstances in which we were living when the MAN came.  The man was bad, it is true. But what! No worse than we were.\"        CHAPTER XXI.    \"When we moved to Moscow, this gentleman--his name was  Troukhatchevsky--came to my house. It was in the morning. I received  him. In former times we had been very familiar. He tried, by various  advances, to re-establish the familiarity, but I was determined to keep  him at a distance, and soon he gave it up. He displeased me extremely.  At the first glance I saw that he was a filthy debauche. I was jealous  of him, even before he had seen my wife. But, strange thing! some occult  fatal power kept me from repulsing him and sending him away, and, on  the contrary, induced me to suffer this approach. What could have been  simpler than to talk with him a few minutes, and then dismiss him coldly  without introducing him to my wife? But no, as if on purpose, I turned  the conversation upon his skill as a violinist, and he answered that,  contrary to what I had heard, he now played the violin more than  formerly. He remembered that I used to play. I answered that I had  abandoned music, but that my wife played very well.    \"Singular thing! Why, in the important events of our life, in those in  which a man's fate is decided,--as mine was decided in that moment,--why  in these events is there neither a past nor a future? My relations with  Troukhatchevsky the first day, at the first hour, were such as they  might still have been after all that has happened. I was conscious that  some frightful misfortune must result from the presence of this  man, and, in spite of that, I could not help being amiable to him. I  introduced him to my wife. She was pleased with him. In the beginning,  I suppose, because of the pleasure of the violin playing, which she  adored. She had even hired for that purpose a violinist from the  theatre. But when she cast a glance at me, she understood my feelings,  and concealed her impression. Then began the mutual trickery and deceit.  I smiled agreeably, pretending that all this pleased me extremely. He,  looking at my wife, as all debauches look at beautiful women, with an  air of being interested solely in the subject of conversation,--that is,  in that which did not interest him at all.    \"She tried to seem indifferent. But my expression, my jealous or  false smile, which she knew so well, and the voluptuous glances of the  musician, evidently excited her. I saw that, after the first interview,  her eyes were already glittering, glittering strangely, and that, thanks  to my jealousy, between him and her had been immediately established  that sort of electric current which is provoked by an identity of  expression in the smile and in the eyes.    \"We talked, at the first interview, of music, of Paris, and of all sorts  of trivialities. He rose to go. Pressing his hat against his swaying  hip, he stood erect, looking now at her and now at me, as if waiting to  see what she would do. I remember that minute, precisely because it was  in my power not to invite him. I need not have invited him, and then  nothing would have happened. But I cast a glance first at him, then at  her. 'Don't flatter yourself that I can be jealous of you,' I thought,  addressing myself to her mentally, and I invited the other to bring his  violin that very "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/690"],[0,"Proposed Roads to Freedom (#13)"],[1," ``the Anarchists think that the destruction of the  capitalist and authoritary society can only be realized  by armed insurrection and violent expropriation,  and that the use of the more or less General Strike  and the Syndicalist movement must not make us  forget the more direct means of struggle against  the military force of government.''    Syndicalists might retort that when the movement  is strong enough to win by armed insurrection  it will be abundantly strong enough to win by the  General Strike. In Labor movements generally, success  through violence can hardly be expected except  in circumstances where success without violence is  attainable. This argument alone, even if there were  no other, would be a very powerful reason against  the methods advocated by the Anarchist Congress.    Syndicalism stands for what is known as industrial  unionism as opposed to craft unionism. In this  respect, as also in the preference of industrial to  political methods, it is part of a movement which  has spread far beyond France. The distinction  between industrial and craft unionism is much dwelt  on by Mr. Cole. Craft unionism ``unites in a single  association those workers who are engaged on a single  industrial process, or on processes so nearly akin  that any one can do another's work.'' But ``organization  may follow the lines, not of the work done,  but of the actual structure of industry. All workers  working at producing a particular kind of commodity  may be organized in a single Union. . . .  The basis of organization would be neither the craft  to which a man belonged nor the employer under  whom he worked, but the service on which he was  engaged. This is Industrial Unionism properly  so called.[28]      [28] ``World of Labour,'' pp. 212, 213.      Industrial unionism is a product of America,  and from America it has to some extent spread to  Great Britain. It is the natural form of fighting  organization when the union is regarded as the means  of carrying on the class war with a view, not to  obtaining this or that minor amelioration, but to a  radical revolution in the economic system. This is  the point of view adopted by the ``Industrial Workers  of the World,'' commonly known as the I. W. W.  This organization more or less corresponds in America  to what the C. G. T. was in France before the  war. The differences between the two are those due  to the different economic circumstances of the two  countries, but their spirit is closely analogous. The  I. W. W. is not united as to the ultimate form which  it wishes society to take. There are Socialists,  Anarchists and Syndicalists among its members. But it  is clear on the immediate practical issue, that the  class war is the fundamental reality in the present  relations of labor and capital, and that it is by  industrial action, especially by the strike, that  emancipation must be sought. The I. W. W., like the  C. G. T., is not nearly so strong numerically as it is  supposed to be by those who fear it. Its influence  is based, not upon its numbers, but upon its power  of enlisting the sympathies of the workers in moments  of crisis.    The labor movement in America has been characterized  on both sides by very great violence. Indeed,  the Secretary of the C. G. T., Monsieur Jouhaux,  recognizes that the C. G. T. is mild in comparison  with the I. W. W. ``The I. W. W.,'' he says,  ``preach a policy of militant action, very necessary  in parts of America, which would not do in France.''[29]  A very interesting account of it, from the point of  view of an author who is neither wholly on the side  of labor nor wholly on the side of the capitalist, but  disinterestedly anxious to find some solution of the  social question short of violence and revolution, is  the work of Mr. John Graham Brooks, called ``American  Syndicalism: the I. W. W.'' (Macmillan, 1913).  American labor conditions are very different from  those of Europe. In the first place, the power of the  trusts is enormous; the concentration of capital has  in this respect proceeded more nearly on Marxian  lines in America than anywhere else. In the second  place, the great influx of foreign labor makes the  whole problem quite different from any that arises  in Europe. The older skilled workers, largely American  born, have long been organized in the American  Federation of Labor under Mr. Gompers. These  represent an aristocracy of labor. They tend to  work with the employers against the great mass of  unskilled immigrants, and they cannot be regarded as  forming part of anything that could be truly called  a labor movement. ``There are,'' says Mr. Cole,  ``now in America two working classes, with different  standards of life, and both are at present almost  impotent in the face of the employers. Nor is it possible  for these two classes to unite or to put forward  any demands. . . . The American Federation  of Labor and the Industrial Workers of the  World represent two different principles of  combination; but they also represent two different  classes of labor.''[30] The I. W. W. stands for industrial  unionism, whereas the American Federation of  Labor stands for craft unionism. The I. W. W. were  formed in 1905 by a union of organizations, chief  among which was the Western Federation of Miners,  which dated from 1892. They suffered a split by the  loss of the followers of Deleon, who was the leader of  the ``Socialist Labor Party'' and advocated a  ``Don't vote'' policy, while reprobating violent  methods. The headquarters of the party which he  formed are at Detroit, and those of the main body  are at Chicago. The I. W. W., though it has a less  definite philosophy than French Syndicalism, is quite  equally determined to destroy the capitalist system.  As its secretary has said: ``There is but one bargain  the I. W. W. will make with the employing class--  complete surrender of all control of industry to the  organized workers.''[31] Mr. Haywood, of the Western  Federation of Miners, is an out-and-out follower  of Marx so far as concerns the class war and the  doctrine of surplus value. But, like all who are in  this movement, he attaches more importance to industrial  as against political action than do the European  followers of Marx. This is no doubt partly  explicable by the special circumstances of America,  where the recent immigrants are apt to be voteless.  The fourth convention of the I. W. W. revised a  preamble giving the general principles underlying  its action. ``The working class and the employing  class,'' they say, ``have nothing in common. There  can be no peace so long as hunger and want are  found among millions of the working people and the  few, who make up the employing class, have all the  good things of life. Between these two classes, a  struggle must go on until the workers of the world  organize as a class, take possession of the earth and  the machinery of production, and abolish the wage  system. . . . Instead of the conservative motto,  `A fair day's wages for a fair day's work,' we must  inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword,  `Abolition of the wage system.' ''[32]      [29] Quoted in Cole, ib. p. 128.    [30] Ib., p. 135.    [31] Brooks, op. cit., p. 79.    [32] Brooks, op. cit., pp. 86-87.      Numerous strikes have been conducted or encouraged  by the I. W. W. and the Western Federation  of Miners. These strikes illustrate the class-war  in a more bitter and extreme form than is to be found  in any other part of the world. Both sides are always  ready to resort to violence. The employers have  armies of their own and are able to call upon the  Militia and even, in a crisis, upon the United States  Army. What French Syndicalists say about the  State as a capitalist institution is peculiarly true in  America. In consequence of the scandals thus arising,  the Federal Government appointed a Commission  on Industrial Relations, whose Report, issued in 1915,  reveals a state of affairs such as it would be difficult  to imagine in Great Britain. The report states that  ``the greatest disorders and most of the outbreaks  of violence in connection with industrial `disputes  arise from the violation of what are considered  to be fundamental rights, and from the perversion  or subversion of governmental institutions''  (p. 146). It mentions, among such perversions,  the subservience of the judiciary to the mili-  tary authorities,[33] the fact that during a labor  dispute the life and liberty of every man within  the State would seem to be at the mercy of the  Governor (p. 72), and the use of State troops  in policing strikes (p. 298). At Ludlow (Colorado)  in 1914 (April 20) a battle of the militia and the  miners took place, in which, as the result of the fire  of the militia, a number of women and children were  burned to death.[34] Many other instances of pitched  battles could be given, but enough has been said to  show the peculiar character of labor disputes in the  United States. It may, I fear, be presumed that this  character will remain so long as a very large  proportion of labor consists of recent immigrants.  When these difficulties pass away, as they must  sooner or later, labor will more and more find its  place in the community, and will tend to feel and  inspire less of the bitter hostility which renders the  more extreme forms of class war possible. When    that time comes, the labor movement in America will  probably begin to take on forms similar to those of  Europe.      [33] Although uniformly held that the writ of habeas corpus  can only be suspended by the legislature, in these labor disturbances  the executive has in fact suspended or disregarded the  writ. . . . In cases arising from labor agitations, the judiciary  has uniformly upheld the power exercised by the military,  and in no case has there been any protest against the use of  such power or any attempt to curtail it, except in Montana,  where the conviction of "]]]
