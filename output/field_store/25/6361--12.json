Therefore all search for the missing  playthings proved in vain for several days, and Claus, who sat at home  waiting for news from the Fairies, almost despaired of getting the toys  before Christmas Eve.    He worked hard every moment, but it took considerable time to carve out  and to shape each toy and to paint it properly, so that on the morning  before Christmas Eve only half of one small shelf above the window was  filled with playthings ready for the children.    But on this morning the Fairies who were searching in the mountains had  a new thought.  They joined hands and moved in a straight line through  the rocks that formed the mountain, beginning at the topmost peak and  working downward, so that no spot could be missed by their bright eyes.  And at last they discovered the cave where the toys had been heaped up  by the wicked Awgwas.    It did not take them long to burst open the mouth of the cave, and then  each one seized as many toys as he could carry and they all flew to  Claus and laid the treasure before him.    The good man was rejoiced to receive, just in the nick of time, such a  store of playthings with which to load his sledge, and he sent word to  Glossie and Flossie to be ready for the journey at nightfall.    With all his other labors he had managed to find time, since the last  trip, to repair the harness and to strengthen his sledge, so that when  the deer came to him at twilight he had no difficulty in harnessing  them.    \"We must go in another direction to-night,\" he told them, \"where we  shall find children I have never yet visited.  And we must travel fast  and work quickly, for my sack is full of toys and running over the  brim!\"    So, just as the moon arose, they dashed out of the Laughing Valley and  across the plain and over the hills to the south.  The air was sharp  and frosty and the starlight touched the snowflakes and made them  glitter like countless diamonds.  The reindeer leaped onward with  strong, steady bounds, and Claus' heart was so light and merry that he  laughed and sang while the wind whistled past his ears:         \"With a ho, ho, ho!        And a ha, ha, ha!    And a ho, ho! ha, ha, hee!        Now away we go        O'er the frozen snow,    As merry as we can be!\"      Jack Frost heard him and came racing up with his nippers, but when he  saw it was Claus he laughed and turned away again.    The mother owls heard him as he passed near a wood and stuck their  heads out of the hollow places in the tree-trunks; but when they saw  who it was they whispered to the owlets nestling near them that it was  only Santa Claus carrying toys to the children.  It is strange how much  those mother owls know.    Claus stopped at some of the scattered farmhouses and climbed down the  chimneys to leave presents for the babies.  Soon after he reached a  village and worked merrily for an hour distributing playthings among  the sleeping little ones.  Then away again he went, signing his joyous  carol:         \"Now away we go        O'er the gleaming snow,    While the deer run swift and free!        For to girls and boys        We carry the toys    That will fill their hearts with glee!\"      The deer liked the sound of his deep bass voice and kept time to the  song with their hoofbeats on the hard snow; but soon they stopped at  another chimney and Santa Claus, with sparkling eyes and face brushed  red by the wind, climbed down its smoky sides and left a present for  every child the house contained.    It was a merry, happy night.  Swiftly the deer ran, and busily their  driver worked to scatter his gifts among the sleeping children.    But the sack was empty at last, and the sledge headed homeward; and now  again the race with daybreak began.  Glossie and Flossie had no mind to  be rebuked a second time for tardiness, so they fled with a swiftness  that enabled them to pass the gale on which the Frost King rode, and  soon brought them to the Laughing Valley.    It is true when Claus released his steeds from their harness the  eastern sky was streaked with gray, but Glossie and Flossie were deep  in the Forest before day fairly broke.    Claus was so wearied with his night's work that he threw himself upon  his bed and fell into a deep slumber, and while he slept the Christmas  sun appeared in the sky and shone upon hundreds of happy homes where  the sound of childish laughter proclaimed that Santa Claus had made  them a visit.    God bless him!  It was his first Christmas Eve, and for hundreds of  years since then he has nobly fulfilled his mission to bring happiness  to the hearts of little children.        11.  How the First Stockings Were Hung by the Chimneys    When you remember that no child, until Santa Claus began his travels,  had ever known the pleasure of possessing a toy, you will understand  how joy crept into the homes of those who had been favored with a visit  from the good man, and how they talked of him day by day in loving  tones and were honestly grateful for his kindly deeds.  It is true that  great warriors and mighty kings and clever scholars of that day were  often spoken of by the people; but no one of them was so greatly  beloved as Santa Claus, because none other was so unselfish as to  devote himself to making others happy.  For a generous deed lives  longer than a great battle or a king's decree of a scholar's essay,  because it spreads and leaves its mark on all nature and endures  through many generations.    The bargain made with the Knook Prince changed the plans of Claus for  all future time; for, being able to use the reindeer on but one night  of each year, he decided to devote all the other days to the  manufacture of playthings, and on Christmas Eve to carry them to the  children of the world.    But a year's work would, he knew, result in a vast accumulation of  toys, so he resolved to build a new sledge that would be larger and  stronger and better-fitted for swift travel than the old and clumsy one.    His first act was to visit the Gnome King, with whom he made a bargain  to exchange three drums, a trumpet and two dolls for a pair of fine  steel runners, curled beautifully at the ends.  For the Gnome King had  children of his own, who, living in the hollows under the earth, in  mines and caverns, needed something to amuse them.    In three days the steel runners were ready, and when Claus brought the  playthings to the Gnome King, his Majesty was so greatly pleased with  them that he presented Claus with a string of sweet-toned sleigh-bells,  in addition to the runners.    \"These will please Glossie and Flossie,\" said Claus, as he jingled the  bells and listened to their merry sound.  \"But I should have two  strings of bells, one for each deer.\"    \"Bring me another trumpet and a toy cat,\" replied the King, \"and you  shall have a second string of bells like the first.\"    \"It is a bargain!\" cried Claus, and he went home again for the toys.    The new sledge was carefully built, the Knooks bringing plenty of  strong but thin boards to use in its construction.  Claus made a high,  rounding dash-board to keep off the snow cast behind by the fleet hoofs  of the deer; and he made high sides to the platform so that many toys  could be carried, and finally he mounted the sledge upon the slender  steel runners made by the Gnome King.    It was certainly a handsome sledge, and big and roomy.  Claus painted  it in bright colors, although no one was likely to see it during his  midnight journeys, and when all was finished he sent for Glossie and  Flossie to come and look at it.    The deer admired the sledge, but gravely declared it was too big and  heavy for them to draw.    \"We might pull it over the snow, to be sure,\" said Glossie; \"but we  would not pull it fast enough to enable us to visit the far-away cities  and villages and return to the Forest by daybreak.\"    \"Then I must add two more deer to my team,\" declared Claus, after a  moment's thought.    \"The Knook Prince allowed you as many as ten.  Why not use them all?\"  asked Flossie.  \"Then we could speed like the lightning and leap to the  highest roofs with ease.\"    \"A team of ten reindeer!\" cried Claus, delightedly.  \"That will be  splendid.  Please return to the Forest at once and select eight other  deer as like yourselves as possible.  And you must all eat of the casa  plant, to become strong, and of the grawle plant, to become fleet of  foot, and of the marbon plant, that you may live long to accompany me  on my journeys.  Likewise it will be well for you to bathe in the Pool  of Nares, which the lovely Queen Zurline declares will render you  rarely beautiful.  Should you perform these duties faithfully there is  no doubt that on next Christmas Eve my ten reindeer will be the most  powerful and beautiful steeds the world has ever seen!\"    So Glossie and Flossie went to the Forest to choose their mates, and  Claus began to consider the question of a harness for them all.    In the end he called upon Peter Knook for assistance, for Peter's heart  is as kind as his body is crooked, and he is remarkably shrewd, as  well.  And Peter agreed to furnish strips of tough leather for the  harness.    This leather was cut from the skins of lions that had reached such an  advanced age that they died naturally, and on one side was tawny hair  while the other side was cured to the softness of velvet by the deft  Knooks.  When Claus received these strips of leather he sewed them  neatly into a harness for the ten reindeer, and it proved strong and  serviceable and lasted him for many years.    The harness and sledge were prepared at odd times, for Claus devoted  most of his days to the making of toys.  These were now much better  than the first ones had been, for the immortals often came to his house  to watch him work and to offer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5201"],[0,"Don Juan Tenorio (#13)"],[1,"suyo; os he pintado                and I have painted you rather  muerto por ella de amor,                as dying for her love,  desesperado por ella,                   desperate for her,  y por ella perseguido,                  because of her, in a lather,  por ella decidido                       determined to risk honour  a perder vida y honor.                  for her, and life above.
