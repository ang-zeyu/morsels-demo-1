In the germ,  Destroy the generations yet unborn!  Ye savage elements, be lords of all!  Return, ye bears; ye ancient wolves, return  To this wide, howling waste! The land is yours.  Who would live here when liberty is gone?    BOY.  Hark! How the wind whistles and the whirlpool roars;  I never saw a storm so fierce as this!    FISHERMAN.  To level at the head of his own child!  Never had father such command before.  And shall not nature, rising in wild wrath,  Revolt against the deed? I should not marvel,  Though to the lake these rocks should bow their heads,  Though yonder pinnacles, yon towers of ice,  That, since creation's dawn, have known no thaw,  Should, from their lofty summits, melt away;  Though yonder mountains, yon primeval cliffs,  Should topple down, and a new deluge whelm  Beneath its waves all living men's abodes!       [Bells heard.    BOY.  Hark! they are ringing on the mountain yonder!  They surely see some vessel in distress,  And toll the bell that we may pray for it.       [Ascends a rock.    FISHERMAN.  Woe to the bark that now pursues its course,  Rocked in the cradle of these storm-tossed waves.  Nor helm nor steersman here can aught avail;  The storm is master. Man is like a ball,  Tossed 'twixt the winds and billows. Far, or near,  No haven offers him its friendly shelter!  Without one ledge to grasp, the sheer, smooth rocks  Look down inhospitably on his despair,  And only tender him their flinty breasts.    BOY (calling from above).  Father, a ship; and bearing down from Flueelen.    FISHERMAN.  Heaven pity the poor wretches! When the storm  Is once entangled in this strait of ours,  It rages like some savage beast of prey,  Struggling against its cage's iron bars.  Howling, it seeks an outlet--all in vain;  For the rocks hedge it round on every side,  Walling the narrow pass as high as heaven.       [He ascends a cliff.    BOY.  It is the governor of Uri's ship;  By its red poop I know it, and the flag.    FISHERMAN.  Judgments of Heaven! Yes, it is he himself.  It is the governor! Yonder he sails,  And with him bears the burden of his crimes!  Soon has the arm of the avenger found him;  Now over him he knows a mightier lord.  These waves yield no obedience to his voice,  These rocks bow not their heads before his cap.  Boy, do not pray; stay not the Judge's arm!    BOY.  I pray not for the governor; I pray  For Tell, who is on board the ship with him.    FISHERMAN.  Alas, ye blind, unreasoning elements!  Must ye, in punishing one guilty head,  Destroy the vessel and the pilot too?    BOY.  See, see, they've cleared the Buggisgrat [20]; but now  The blast, rebounding from the Devil's Minster [21],  Has driven them back on the Great Axenberg. [22]  I cannot see them now.    FISHERMAN.              The Hakmesser [23]  Is there, that's foundered many a gallant ship.  If they should fail to double that with skill,  Their bark will go to pieces on the rocks  That hide their jagged peaks below the lake.  They have on board the very best of pilots;  If any man can save them, Tell is he;  But he is manacled, both hand and foot.       [Enter WILLIAM TELL, with his crossbow. He enters     precipitately, looks wildly round, and testifies the     most violent agitation. When he reaches the centre     of the stage, he throws himself upon his knees, and     stretches out his hands, first towards the earth, then     towards heaven.    BOY (observing him).  See, father! Who is that man, kneeling yonder?    FISHERMAN.  He clutches at the earth with both his hands,  And looks as though he were beside himself.    BOY (advancing).  What do I see? Father, come here, and look!    FISHERMAN (approaches).  Who is it? God in heaven! What! William Tell,  How came you hither? Speak, Tell!    BOY.                    Were you not  In yonder ship, a prisoner, and in chains?    FISHERMAN.  Were they not bearing you away to Kuessnacht?    TELL (rising).  I am released.    FISHERMAN and BOY.          Released, oh miracle!    BOY.  Whence came you here?    TELL.              From yonder vessel!    FISHERMAN.                        What?    BOY.  Where is the viceroy?    TELL.              Drifting on the waves.    FISHERMAN.  Is't possible? But you! How are you here?  How 'scaped you from your fetters and the storm?    TELL.  By God's most gracious providence. Attend.    FISHERMAN and BOY.  Say on, say on!    TELL.           You know what passed at Altdorf?    FISHERMAN.  I do--say on!    TELL.          How I was seized and bound,  And ordered by the governor to Kuessnacht.    FISHERMAN.  And how with you at Flueelen he embarked.  All this we know. Say, how have you escaped?    TELL.  I lay on deck, fast bound with cords, disarmed,  In utter hopelessness. I did not think  Again to see the gladsome light of day,  Nor the dear faces of my wife and children;  And eyed disconsolate the waste of waters----    FISHERMAN.  Oh, wretched man!    TELL.            Then we put forth; the viceroy,  Rudolph der Harras, and their suite. My bow  And quiver lay astern beside the helm;  And just as we had reached the corner, near  The Little Axen [24], heaven ordained it so,  That from the Gotthardt's gorge, a hurricane  Swept down upon us with such headlong force,  That every rower's heart within him sank,  And all on board looked for a watery grave.  Then heard I one of the attendant train,  Turning to Gessler, in this strain accost him:  \"You see our danger, and your own, my lord  And that we hover on the verge of death.  The boatmen there are powerless from fear,  Nor are they confident what course to take;  Now, here is Tell, a stout and fearless man,  And knows to steer with more than common skill.  How if we should avail ourselves of him  In this emergency?\" The viceroy then  Addressed me thus: \"If thou wilt undertake  To bring us through this tempest safely, Tell,  I might consent to free thee from thy bonds.\"  I answered, \"Yes, my lord, with God's assistance,  I'll see what can be done, and help us heaven!\"  On this they loosed me from my bonds, and I  Stood by the helm and fairly steered along;  Yet ever eyed my shooting-gear askance,  And kept a watchful eye upon the shore,  To find some point where I might leap to land  And when I had descried a shelving crag,  That jutted, smooth atop, into the lake----    FISHERMAN.  I know it. 'Tis at foot of the Great Axen;  But looks so steep, I never could have dreamed  'Twere possible to leap it from the boat.    TELL.  I bade the men put forth their utmost might,  Until we came before the shelving crag.  For there, I said, the danger will be past!  Stoutly they pulled, and soon we neared the point;  One prayer to God for his assisting grace,  And straining every muscle, I brought round  The vessel's stern close to the rocky wall;  Then snatching up my weapons, with a bound  I swung myself upon the flattened shelf,  And with my feet thrust off, with all my might,  The puny bark into the hell of waters.  There let it drift about, as heaven ordains!  Thus am I here, delivered from the might  Of the dread storm, and man, more dreadful still.    FISHERMAN.  Tell, Tell, the Lord has manifestly wrought  A miracle in thy behalf! I scarce  Can credit my own eyes. But tell me, now,  Whither you purpose to betake yourself?  For you will be in peril should the viceroy  Chance to escape this tempest with his life.    TELL.  I heard him say, as I lay bound on board,  His purpose was to disembark at Brunnen;  And, crossing Schwytz, convey me to his castle.    FISHERMAN.  Means he to go by land?    TELL.               So he intends.    FISHERMAN.  Oh, then, conceal yourself without delay!  Not twice will heaven release you from his grasp.    TELL.  Which is the nearest way to Arth and Kuessnacht?    FISHERMAN.  The public road leads by the way of Steinen,  But there's a nearer road, and more retired,  That goes by Lowerz, which my boy can show you.    TELL (gives him his hand).  May heaven reward your kindness! Fare ye well!       [As he is going he comes back.    Did not you also take the oath at Rootli?  I heard your name, methinks.    FISHERMAN.                 Yes, I was there,  And took the oath of the confederacy;    TELL.  Then do me this one favor; speed to Buerglen  My wife is anxious at my absence--tell her  That I am free, and in secure concealment.    FISHERMAN.  But whither shall I tell her you have fled?    TELL.  You'll find her father with her, and some more,  Who took the oath with you upon the Rootli;  Bid them be resolute, and strong of heart,  For Tell is free and master of his arm;  They shall hear further news of me ere long.    FISHERMAN.  What have you, then, in view? Come, tell me frankly!    TELL.  When once 'tis done 'twill be in every mouth.                         [Exit.    FISHERMAN.  Show him the way, boy. Heaven be his support!  Whate'er he has resolved, he'll execute.                         [Exit.        SCENE II.       Baronial mansion of Attinghausen. The BARON upon a couch dying.     WALTER FURST, STAUFFACHER, MELCHTHAL, and BAUMGARTEN attending round     him. WALTER TELL kneeling before the dying man.    FURST.  All now is over with him. He is gone.    STAUFFACHER.  He lies not like one dead. The feather, see,  Moves on his lips! His sleep is very calm,  And on his features plays a placid smile.       [BAUMGARTEN goes to the door and speaks with some one.    FURST.  Who's there?    BAUGMARTEN (returning).         Tell's wife, your daughter; she insists  That she must speak with you, and see her boy.       [WALTER TELL rises.    FURST.  I who need comfort--can I comfort her?  Does every sorrow centre on my head?    HEDWIG (forcing her way in).  Where is my child? Unhand me! I must see him.    STAUFFACHER.  Be calm! Reflect you're in the house of death!    HEDWIG (falling upon her boy's neck).  My Walter! Oh, he yet is mine!    WALTER.           "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6791"],[0,"Mary Stuart: A Tragedy (#13)"],[1,"and severe).  What would you say to me, my Lady Stuart?  You wished to speak with me; and I, forgetting  The queen, and all the wrongs I have sustained,  Fulfil the pious duty of the sister,  And grant the boon you wished for of my presence.  Yet I, in yielding to the generous feelings  Of magnanimity, expose myself  To rightful censure, that I stoop so low.  For well you know you would have had me murdered.    MARY.  Oh! how shall I begin? Oh, how shall I  So artfully arrange my cautious words  That they may touch, yet not offend your heart?  Strengthen my words, O Heaven! and take from them  Whate'er might wound. Alas! I cannot speak  In my own cause without impeaching you,  And that most heavily, I wish not so;  You have not as you ought behaved to me:  I am a queen, like you: yet you have held me  Confined in prison. As a suppliant  I came to you, yet you in me insulted  The pious use of hospitality;  Slighting in me the holy law of nations,  Immured me in a dungeon--tore from me  My friends and servants; to unseemly want  I was exposed, and hurried to the bar  Of a disgraceful, insolent tribunal.  No more of this;--in everlasting silence  Be buried all the cruelties I suffered!  See--I will throw the blame of all on fate,  'Twere not your fault, no more than it was mine.  An evil spirit rose from the abyss,  To kindle in our hearts the flame of hate,  By which our tender youth had been divided.  It grew with us, and bad, designing men  Fanned with their ready breath the fatal fire:  Frantics, enthusiasts, with sword and dagger  Armed the uncalled-for hand! This is the curse  Of kings, that they, divided, tear the world  In pieces with their hatred, and let loose  The raging furies of all hellish strife!  No foreign tongue is now between us, sister,       [Approaching her confidently, and with a flattering tone.    Now stand we face to face; now, sister, speak:  Name but my crime, I'll fully satisfy you,--  Alas! had you vouchsafed to hear me then,  When I so earnest sought to meet your eye,  It never would have come to this, nor would,  Here in this mournful place, have happened now  This so distressful, this so mournful meeting.    ELIZABETH.  My better stars preserved me. I was warned,  And laid not to my breast the poisonous adder!  Accuse not fate! your own deceitful heart  It was, the wild ambition of your house  As yet no enmities had passed between us,  When your imperious uncle, the proud priest,  Whose shameless hand grasps at all crowns, attacked me  With unprovoked hostility, and taught  You, but too docile, to assume my arms,  To vest yourself with my imperial title,  And meet me in the lists in mortal strife:  What arms employed he not to storm my throne?  The curses of the priests, the people's sword,  The dreadful weapons of religious frenzy;--  Even here in my own kingdom's peaceful haunts  He fanned the flames of civil insurrection;  But God is with me, and the haughty priest  Has not maintained the field. The blow was aimed  Full at my head, but yours it is which falls!    MARY.  I'm in the hand of heaven. You never will  Exert so cruelly the power it gives you.    ELIZABETH.  Who shall prevent me? Say, did not your uncle  Set all the kings of Europe the example,  How to conclude a peace with those they hate.  Be mine the school of Saint Bartholomew;  What's kindred then to me, or nation's laws?  The church can break the bands of every duty;  It consecrates the regicide, the traitor;  I only practise what your priests have taught!  Say then, what surety can be offered me,  Should I magnanimously loose your bonds?  Say, with what lock can I secure your faith,  Which by Saint Peter's keys cannot be opened?  Force is my only surety; no alliance  Can be concluded with a race of vipers.    MARY.  Oh! this is but your wretched, dark suspicion!  For you have constantly regarded me  But as a stranger, and an enemy.  Had you declared me heir to your dominions,  As is my right, then gratitude and love  In me had fixed, for you, a faithful friend  And kinswoman.    ELIZABETH.          Your friendship is abroad,  Your house is papacy, the monk your brother.  Name you my successor! The treacherous snare!  That in my life you might seduce my people;  And, like a sly Armida, in your net  Entangle all our noble English youth;  That all might turn to the new rising sun,  And I----    MARY.  O sister, rule your realm in peace;  I give up every claim to these domains--  Alas! the pinions of my soul are lamed;  Greatness entices me no more: your point  Is gained; I am but Mary's shadow now--  My noble spirit is at last broke down  By long captivity:--you've done your worst  On me; you have destroyed me in my bloom!  Now, end your work, my sister;--speak at length  The word, which to pronounce has brought you hither;  For I will ne'er believe that you are come,  To mock unfeelingly your hapless victim.  Pronounce this word;--say, \"Mary, you are free:  You have already felt my power,--learn now  To honor too my generosity.\"  Say this, and I will take my life, will take  My freedom, as a present from your hands.  One word makes all undone;--I wait for it;--  Oh, let it not be needlessly delayed.  Woe to you if you end not with this word!  For should you not, like some divinity,  Dispensing noble blessings, quit me now,  Then, sister, not for all this island's wealth,  For all the realms encircled by the deep,  Would I exchange my present lot for yours.    ELIZABETH.  And you confess at last that you are conquered:  Are all your schemes run out? No more assassins  Now on the road? Will no adventurer  Attempt again for you the sad achievement?  Yes, madam, it is over:--you'll seduce  No mortal more. The world has other cares;--  None is ambitious of the dangerous honor  Of being your fourth husband--you destroy  Your wooers like your husbands.    MARY (starting angrily).                   Sister, sister!--  Grant me forbearance, all ye powers of heaven!    ELIZABETH (regards her long with a look of proud contempt).  Those then, my Lord of Leicester, are the charms  Which no man with impunity can view,  Near which no woman dare to stand?  In sooth, this honor has been cheaply gained;  She who to all is common, may with ease  Become the common object of applause.    MARY.  This is too much!    ELIZABETH (laughing insultingly).            You show us now, indeed,  Your real face; till now 'twas but the mask.    MARY (burning with rage, yet dignified and noble).  My sins were human, and the faults of youth:  Superior force misled me. I have never  Denied or sought to hide it: I despised  All false appearance, as became a queen.  The worst of me is known, and I can say,  That I am better than the fame I bear.  Woe to you! when, in time to come, the world  Shall draw the robe of honor from your deeds,  With which thy arch-hypocrisy has veiled  The raging flames of lawless, secret lust.  Virtue was not your portion from your mother;  Well know we what it was which brought the head  Of Anna Boleyn to the fatal block.    SHREWSBURY (stepping between both QUEENS).  Oh! Heaven! Alas, and must it come to this!  Is this the moderation, the submission,  My lady?----    MARY.        Moderation! I've supported  What human nature can support: farewell,  Lamb-hearted resignation, passive patience,  Fly to thy native heaven; burst at length  Thy bonds, come forward from thy dreary cave,  In all thy fury, long suppressed rancor!  And thou, who to the angered basilisk  Impart'st the murderous glance, oh, arm my tongue  With poisoned darts!    SHREWSBURY.             She is beside herself!  Exasperated, mad! My liege, forgive her.       [ELIZABETH, speechless with anger, casts enraged looks at MARY.    LEICESTER (in the most violent agitation; he seeks to lead ELIZABETH   away).  Attend not to her rage! Away, away,  From this disastrous place!    MARY (raising her voice).                 A bastard soils,  Profanes the English throne! The generous Britons  Are cheated by a juggler, [whose whole figure  Is false and painted, heart as well as face!]  If right prevailed, you now would in the dust  Before me lie, for I'm your rightful monarch!       [ELIZABETH hastily quits the stage; the lords follow her     in the greatest consternation.        SCENE V.       MARY, KENNEDY.    KENNEDY.  What have you done? She has gone hence in wrath  All hope is over now!    MARY (still quite beside herself).              Gone hence in wrath!  She carries death within her heart! I know it.       [Falling on KENNEDY'S bosom.    Now I am happy, Hannah! and at last,  After whole years of sorrow and abasement,  One moment of victorious revenge  A weight falls off my heart, a weight of mountains;  I plunged the steel in my oppressor's breast!    KENNEDY.  Unhappy lady! Frenzy overcomes you.  Yes, you have wounded your inveterate foe;  'Tis she who wields the lightning, she is queen,  You have insulted her before her minion.    MARY.  I have abased her before Leicester's eyes;  He saw it, he was witness of my triumph.  How did I hurl her from her haughty height,  He saw it, and his presence strengthened me.        SCENE VI.       Enter MORTIMER.    KENNEDY.  Oh, Sir! What an occurrence!    MORTIMER.                  I heard all--       [Gives the nurse a sign to repair to her post,     and draws nearer; his whole appearance expresses     the utmost violence of passion.    Thine is the palm;--thou trod'st her to the dust!--  Thou wast the queen, she was the malefactor;--  I am transported with thy noble courage;--  Yes! I adore thee; like a Deity,  My sense is dazzled by thy heavenly beams.    MARY (with vivacity and expectation).  You spoke with Leicester, gave my letter to him.  My present, too?--oh, speak, sir.    MORTIMER (beholding her with glowing looks).                    How thy noble,  Thy royal indignation shone, and cast  A glory round thy beauty; yes, by heavens,  Thou art the fairest woman upon earth!    MARY.  Sir, satisfy, I beg you, my"]]]
