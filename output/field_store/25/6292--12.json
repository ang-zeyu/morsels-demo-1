General Taylor never made any great show or parade, either of uniform or  retinue.  In dress he was possibly too plain, rarely wearing anything in  the field to indicate his rank, or even that he was an officer; but he  was known to every soldier in his army, and was respected by all.  I can  call to mind only one instance when I saw him in uniform, and one other  when I heard of his wearing it, On both occasions he was unfortunate.  The first was at Corpus Christi.  He had concluded to review his army  before starting on the march and gave orders accordingly.  Colonel  Twiggs was then second in rank with the army, and to him was given the  command of the review.  Colonel and Brevet Brigadier-General Worth, a  far different soldier from Taylor in the use of the uniform, was next to  Twiggs in rank, and claimed superiority by virtue of his brevet rank  when the accidents of service threw them where one or the other had to  command.  Worth declined to attend the review as subordinate to Twiggs  until the question was settled by the highest authority.  This broke up  the review, and the question was referred to Washington for final  decision.    General Taylor was himself only a colonel, in real rank, at that time,  and a brigadier-general by brevet.  He was assigned to duty, however, by  the President, with the rank which his brevet gave him.  Worth was not  so assigned, but by virtue of commanding a division he must, under the  army regulations of that day, have drawn the pay of his brevet rank.  The question was submitted to Washington, and no response was received  until after the army had reached the Rio Grande.  It was decided against  General Worth, who at once tendered his resignation and left the army,  going north, no doubt, by the same vessel that carried it.  This kept  him out of the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.  Either the  resignation was not accepted, or General Worth withdrew it before action  had been taken.  At all events he returned to the army in time to  command his division in the battle of Monterey, and served with it to  the end of the war.    The second occasion on which General Taylor was said to have donned his  uniform, was in order to receive a visit from the Flag Officer of the  naval squadron off the mouth of the Rio Grande.  While the army was on  that river the Flag Officer sent word that he would call on the General  to pay his respects on a certain day.  General Taylor, knowing that  naval officers habitually wore all the uniform the \"law allowed\" on all  occasions of ceremony, thought it would be only civil to receive his  guest in the same style.  His uniform was therefore got out, brushed up,  and put on, in advance of the visit.  The Flag Officer, knowing General  Taylor's aversion to the wearing of the uniform, and feeling that it  would be regarded as a compliment should he meet him in civilian's  dress, left off his uniform for this occasion.  The meeting was said to  have been embarrassing to both, and the conversation was principally  apologetic.    The time was whiled away pleasantly enough at Matamoras, while we were  waiting for volunteers.  It is probable that all the most important  people of the territory occupied by our army left their homes before we  got there, but with those remaining the best of relations apparently  existed.  It was the policy of the Commanding General to allow no  pillaging, no taking of private property for public or individual use  without satisfactory compensation, so that a better market was afforded  than the people had ever known before.    Among the troops that joined us at Matamoras was an Ohio regiment, of  which Thomas L. Hamer, the Member of Congress who had given me my  appointment to West Point, was major.  He told me then that he could  have had the colonelcy, but that as he knew he was to be appointed a  brigadier-general, he preferred at first to take the lower grade.  I  have said before that Hamer was one of the ablest men Ohio ever  produced.  At that time he was in the prime of life, being less than  fifty years of age, and possessed an admirable physique, promising long  life.  But he was taken sick before Monterey, and died within a few  days.  I have always believed that had his life been spared, he would  have been President of the United States during the term filled by  President Pierce.  Had Hamer filled that office his partiality for me  was such, there is but little doubt I should have been appointed to one  of the staff corps of the army--the Pay Department probably--and would  therefore now be preparing to retire.  Neither of these speculations is  unreasonable, and they are mentioned to show how little men control  their own destiny.    Reinforcements having arrived, in the month of August the movement  commenced from Matamoras to Camargo, the head of navigation on the Rio  Grande.  The line of the Rio Grande was all that was necessary to hold,  unless it was intended to invade Mexico from the North.  In that case  the most natural route to take was the one which General Taylor  selected.  It entered a pass in the Sierra Madre Mountains, at Monterey,  through which the main road runs to the City of Mexico.  Monterey itself  was a good point to hold, even if the line of the Rio Grande covered all  the territory we desired to occupy at that time.  It is built on a plain  two thousand feet above tide water, where the air is bracing and the  situation healthy.    On the 19th of August the army started for Monterey, leaving a small  garrison at Matamoras.  The troops, with the exception of the artillery,  cavalry, and the brigade to which I belonged, were moved up the river to  Camargo on steamers.  As there were but two or three of these, the boats  had to make a number of trips before the last of the troops were  up. Those who marched did so by the south side of the river.  Lieutenant-Colonel Garland, of the 4th infantry, was the brigade  commander, and on this occasion commanded the entire marching force.  One day out convinced him that marching by day in that latitude, in the  month of August, was not a beneficial sanitary measure, particularly for  Northern men.  The order of marching was changed and night marches were  substituted with the best results.    When Camargo was reached, we found a city of tents outside the Mexican  hamlet.  I was detailed to act as quartermaster and commissary to the  regiment.  The teams that had proven abundantly sufficient to transport  all supplies from Corpus Christi to the Rio Grande over the level  prairies of Texas, were entirely inadequate to the needs of the  reinforced army in a mountainous country.  To obviate the deficiency,  pack mules were hired, with Mexicans to pack and drive them.  I had  charge of the few wagons allotted to the 4th infantry and of the pack  train to supplement them.  There were not men enough in the army to  manage that train without the help of Mexicans who had learned how.  As  it was the difficulty was great enough.  The troops would take up their  march at an early hour each day.  After they had started, the tents and  cooking utensils had to be made into packages, so that they could be  lashed to the backs of the mules.  Sheet-iron kettles, tent-poles and  mess chests were inconvenient articles to transport in that way.  It  took several hours to get ready to start each morning, and by the time  we were ready some of the mules first loaded would be tired of standing  so long with their loads on their backs. Sometimes one would start to  run, bowing his back and kicking up until he scattered his load; others  would lie down and try to disarrange their loads by attempting to get on  the top of them by rolling on them; others with tent-poles for part of  their loads would manage to run a tent-pole on one side of a sapling  while they would take the other.  I am not aware of ever having used a  profane expletive in my life; but I would have the charity to excuse  those who may have done so, if they were in charge of a train of Mexican  pack mules at the time.        CHAPTER VIII.    ADVANCE ON MONTEREY--THE BLACK FORT--THE BATTLE OF MONTEREY--SURRENDER  OF THE CITY.    The advance from Camargo was commenced on the 5th of September. The army  was divided into four columns, separated from each other by one day's  march.  The advance reached Cerralvo in four days and halted for the  remainder of the troops to come up.  By the 13th the rear-guard had  arrived, and the same day the advance resumed its march, followed as  before, a day separating the divisions.  The forward division halted  again at Marin, twenty-four miles from Monterey.  Both this place and  Cerralvo were nearly deserted, and men, women and children were seen  running and scattered over the hills as we approached; but when the  people returned they found all their abandoned property safe, which must  have given them a favorable opinion of Los Grengos--\"the Yankees.\"  From  Marin the movement was in mass. On the 19th General Taylor, with his  army, was encamped at Walnut Springs, within three miles of Monterey.    The town is on a small stream coming out of the mountain-pass, and is  backed by a range of hills of moderate elevation.  To the north, between  the city and Walnut Springs, stretches an extensive plain.  On this  plain, and entirely outside of the last houses of the city, stood a  strong fort, enclosed on all sides, to which our army gave the name of  \"Black Fort.\"  Its guns commanded the approaches to the city to the full  extent of their range.  There were two detached spurs of hills or  mountains to the north and northwest of the city, which were also  fortified.  On one of these stood the Bishop's Palace.  The road to  Saltillo leaves the upper or western end of the city under the fire of  the guns from these heights.  The lower or eastern end was defended by  two or three small detached works, armed with artillery and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4376"],[0,"Sowing Seeds in Danny (#13)"],[1,"hings.    Pearl had bidden good-bye to them all and was walking to the door when  her mother called her back to repeat her parting instructions.    \"Now, mind, Pearlie dear, not to be pickin' up wid strangers, and  speakin' to people ye don't know, and don't be showin' yer money or  makin' change wid anyone.\"    Pearl was not likely to disobey the last injunction. She had seventeen  cents in money, ten cents of which Teddy had given her, and the  remaining seven cents had come in under the heading of small sums, from  the other members of the family.    She was a pathetic little figure in her brown and white checked dress,  with her worldly effects in the bird-cage, as she left the shelter of  her father's roof and went forth into the untried world. She went over  to Mrs. Francis to say good-bye to her and to Camilla.    Mrs. Francis was much pleased with Pearl's spirit of independence and  spoke beautifully of the opportunities for service which would open for  her.    \"You must keep a diary, Pearl,\" she said enthusiastically. \"Set down in  it all you see and feel. You will have such splendid opportunities for  observing plant and animal life--the smallest little insect is  wonderfully interesting. I will be so anxious to hear how you are  impressed with the great green world of Out of Doors! Take care of your  health, too, Pearl; see that your room is ventilated.\"    While Mrs. Francis elaborated on the elements of proper living, Camilla  in the kitchen had opened the little bundle in the cage, and put into  it a pair of stockings and two or three handkerchiefs, then she slipped  in a little purse containing ten shining ten-cent pieces, and an  orange. She arranged the bundle to look just as it did before, so that  she would not have to meet Pearl's gratitude.    Camilla hastily set the kettle to boil, and began to lay the table. She  could hear the velvety tones of Mrs. Francis's voice in the library.    \"Mrs. Francis speaks a strange language,\" she said, smiling to herself,  \"but it can be translated into bread and butter and apple sauce, and  even into shoes and stockings, when you know how to interpret it. But  wouldn't it be dreadful if she had no one to express it in the tangible  things of life for her. Think of her talking about proper diet and aids  to digestion to that little hungry girl. Well, it seems to be my  mission to step into the gap--I'm a miss with a mission\"--she was  slicing some cold ham as she spoke--\"I am something of a health talker,  too.\"    Camilla knocked at the library door, and in answer to Mrs. Francis's  invitation to enter, opened the door and said:    \"Mrs. Francis, would it not be well for Pearl to have a lunch before  she starts for her walk into the country; the air is so exhilarating,  you know.\"    \"How thoughtful you are, Camilla!\" Mrs. Francis exclaimed with honest  admiration.    Thus it happened that Pearlie Watson, aged twelve, began her journey  into the big unknown world, fully satisfied in body and soul, and with  a great love for all the world.    At the corner of the street stood Mrs. McGuire, and at sight of her  Pearl's heart stopped beating.    \"It's bad luck,\" she said. \"I'd as lief have a rabbit cross me path as  her.\"    But she walked bravely forward with no outward sign of her inward  trembling.    \"Goin' to Sam Motherwell's, are ye?\" the old lady asked shrilly.    \"Yes'm,\" Pearl said, trembling.    \"She's a tarter; she's a skinner; she's a damner; that's what she is.  She's my own first cousin and I know HER. Sass her; that's the only way  to get along with her. Tell her I said so. Here, child, rub yer j'ints  with this when ye git stiff.\" She handed Pearl a black bottle of  home-made liniment.    Pearl thanked her and hurried on, but at the next turn of the street  she met Danny.    Danny was in tears; Danny wasn't going to let Pearlie go away; Danny  would run away and get lost and runned over and drownded, now! Pearl's  heart melted, and sitting on the sidewalk she took Danny in her arms,  and they cried together. A whirr of wheels aroused Pearl and looking up  she saw the kindly face of the young doctor.    \"What is it, Pearl?\" he asked kindly. \"Surely that's not Danny I see,  spoiling his face that way!\"    \"It's Danny,\" Pearl said unsteadily. \"It's hard enough to leave him  widout him comin' afther me and breakin' me heart all over again.\"    \"That's what it is, Pearl,\" the doctor said, smiling. \"I think it is  mighty thoughtless of Danny the way he is acting.\"    Danny held obstinately to Pearl's skirt, and cried harder than ever. He  would not even listen when the doctor spoke of taking him for a drive.    \"Listen to the doctor,\" Pearl commanded sternly, \"or he'll raise a  gumboil on ye.\"    Thus admonished Danny ceased his sobs; but he showed no sign of  interest when the doctor spoke of popcorn, and at the mention of  ice-cream he looked simply bored.    \"He's awful fond of 'hoo-hung' candy,\" Pearlie suggested in a whisper,  holding her hand around her mouth so that Danny might not hear her.    \"Ten cents' worth of 'hoo-hung' candy to the boy that says good-bye to  his sister like a gentleman and rides home with me.\"    Danny dried his eyes on Pearl's skirt, kissed her gravely and climbed  into the buggy beside the doctor. Waterloo was won!    Pearl did not trust herself to look back as she walked along the deeply  beaten road.    The yellow cone-flowers raised their heads like golden stars along the  roadside, and the golden glory of the approaching harvest lay upon  everything. To the right the Tiger Hills lay on the horizon wrapped in  a blue mist. Flocks of blackbirds swarmed over the ripening oats, and  angrily fought with each other.    \"And it not costin' them a cent!\" Pearl said in disgust as she stopped  to watch them.    The exhilaration of the air, the glory of the waving grain, the  profusion of wild flowers that edged the fields with purple and yellow  were like wine to her sympathetic Irish heart as she walked through the  grain fields and drank in all the beauties that lay around, and it was  not until she came in sight of the big stone house, gloomy and bare,  that she realised with a start of homesickness that she was Pearl  Watson, aged twelve, away from home for the first time, and bound to  work three months for a woman of reputed ill-temper.    \"But I'll do it,\" Pearl said, swallowing the lump that gathered in her  throat, \"I can work. Nobody never said that none of the Watsons  couldn't work. I'll stay out me time if it kills me.\"    So saying, Pearl knocked timidly at the back door. Myriads of flies  buzzed on the screen. From within a tired voice said, \"Come in.\"    Pearl walked in and saw a large bare room, with a long table in the  middle. A sewing machine littered with papers stood in front of one  window.    The floor had been painted a dull drab, but the passing of many feet  had worn the paint away in places. A stove stood in one corner. Over  the sink a tall, round-shouldered woman bent trying to get water from  an asthmatic pump.    \"Oh, it's you, is it?\" she said in a tone so very unpleasant that Pearl  thought she must have expected someone else.    \"Yes'm,\" Pearl said meekly. \"Who were ye expectin'?\"    Mrs. Motherwell stopped pumping for a minute and looked at Pearl.    \"Why didn't ye git here earlier?\" she asked.    \"Well,\" Pearl began, \"I was late gettin' started by reason of the  washin' and the ironin', and Jimmy not gettin' back wid the boots. He  went drivin' cattle for Vale the butcher, and he had to have the boots  for the poison ivy is that bad, and because the sugar o' lead is all  done and anyway ma don't like to keep it in the house, for wee Danny  might eat it--he's that stirrin' and me not there to watch him now.\"    \"Lord! what a tongue you have! Put down your things and go out and pick  up chips to light the fire with in the morning.\"    Pearl laid her bird-cage on a chair and was back so soon with the chips  that Mrs. Motherwell could not think of anything to say.    \"Now go for the cows,\" she said, \"and don't run them home!\"    \"Where will I run them to then, ma'am?\" Pearl asked innocently.    \"Good land, child, have I to tell you everything? Folks that can't do  without tellin' can't do much with, I say. Bring the cows to the bars,  and don't stand there staring at me.\"    When Pearl dashed out of the door, she almost fell over the old dog who  lay sleepily snapping at the flies which buzzed around his head. He  sprang up with a growl which died away into an apologetic yawn as she  stooped to pat his honest brown head.    A group of red calves stood at the bars of a small field plaintively  calling for their supper. It was not just an ordinary bawl, but a  double-jointed hyphenated appeal, indicating a very exhausted condition  indeed.    Pearl looked at them in pity. The old dog, wrinkling his nose and  turning away his head, did not give them a glance. He knew them. Noisy  things! Let 'em bawl. Come on!    Across the narrow creek they bounded, Pearl and old Nap, and up the  other hill where the silver willows grew so tall they were hidden in  them. The goldenrod nodded its plumy head in the breeze, and the tall  Gaillardia, brown and yellow, flickered unsteadily on its stem.    The billows of shadow swept over the wheat on each side of the narrow  pasture; the golden flowers, the golden fields, the warm golden  sunshine intoxicated Pearl with their luxurious beauty, and in that  hour of delight she realised more pleasure from them than Sam  Motherwell and his wife had in all their long lives of barren  selfishness. Their souls were of a dull drab dryness in which no flower  took root, there was no gold to them but the gold of greed and gain,  and with it they had never bought a smile or a gentle hand pressure or  a fervid \"God bless you!\" and so it lost its golden colour, and turned  to lead and ashes in their hands.    When Pearl and Nap got the cows turned homeward they had to"]]]
