Have you  ever tried talking medical shop during tea? Nothing like it for giving  you an appetite.'    'Has he got anything readable?'    'Rather. Have you ever tried anything of James Payn's?'    'I've read _Terminations_, or something,' said Tony doubtfully,  'but he's so obscure.'    'Don't,' said Charteris sadly, 'please don't. _Terminations_ is by  one Henry James, and there is a substantial difference between him and  James Payn. Anyhow, if you want a short biography of James Payn, he  wrote a hundred books, and they're all simply ripping, and Adamson has  got a good many of them, and I'm hoping to borrow a couple--any two  will do--and you're going to read them. I know one always bars a book  that's recommended to one, but you've got no choice. You're not going  to get anything else till you've finished those two.'    'All right,' said Tony. 'But Stapleton's out of bounds. I suppose  Merevale'll give you leave to go in.'    'He won't,' said Charteris. 'I shan't ask him. On principle. So long.'    On the following afternoon Charteris went into Stapleton. The distance  by road was almost exactly one mile. If you went by the fields it was  longer, because you probably lost your way.    Dr Adamson's house was in the High Street. Charteris knocked at the  door. The servant was sorry, but the doctor was out. Her tone seemed to  suggest that, if she had had any say in the matter, he would have  remained in. Would Charteris come in and wait? Charteris rather thought  he would. He waited for half an hour, and then, as the absent medico  did not appear to be coming, took two books from the shelf, wrote a  succinct note explaining what he had done, and why he had done it,  hoping the doctor would not mind, and went out with his literary  trophies into the High Street again.    The time was now close on five o'clock. Lock-up was not till a quarter  past six--six o'clock nominally, but the doors were always left open  till a quarter past. It would take him about fifteen minutes to get  back, less if he trotted. Obviously, the thing to do here was to spend  a thoughtful quarter of an hour or so inspecting the sights of the  town. These were ordinarily not numerous, but this particular day  happened to be market day, and there was a good deal going on. The High  Street was full of farmers, cows, and other animals, the majority of  the former well on the road to intoxication. It is, of course,  extremely painful to see a man in such a condition, but when such a  person is endeavouring to count a perpetually moving drove of pigs, the  onlooker's pain is sensibly diminished. Charteris strolled along the  High Street observing these and other phenomena with an attentive eye.  Opposite the Town Hall he was button-holed by a perfect stranger, whom,  by his conversation, he soon recognized as the Stapleton 'character'.  There is a 'character' in every small country town. He is not a bad  character; still less is he a good character. He is just a 'character'  pure and simple. This particular man--or rather, this man, for he was  anything but particular--apparently took a great fancy to Charteris at  first sight. He backed him gently against a wall, and insisted on  telling him an interminable anecdote of his shady past, when, it  seemed, he had been a 'super' in some travelling company. The plot of  the story, as far as Charteris could follow it, dealt with a theatrical  tour in Dublin, where some person or persons unknown had, with malice  prepense, scattered several pounds of snuff on the stage previous to a  performance of _Hamlet_; and, according to the 'character', when  the ghost of Hamlet's father sneezed steadily throughout his great  scene, there was not a dry eye in the house. The 'character' had  concluded that anecdote, and was half-way through another, when  Charteris, looking at his watch, found that it was almost six o'clock.  He interrupted one of the 'character's' periods by diving past him and  moving rapidly down the street. The historian did not seem to object.  Charteris looked round and saw that he had button-holed a fresh victim.  He was still gazing in one direction and walking in another, when he  ran into somebody.    'Sorry,' said Charteris hastily. 'Hullo!'    It was the secretary of the Old Crockfordians, and, to judge from the  scowl on that gentleman's face, the recognition was mutual.    'It's you, is it?' said the secretary in his polished way.    'I believe so,' said Charteris.    'Out of bounds,' observed the man.    Charteris was surprised. This grasp of technical lore on the part of a  total outsider was as unexpected as it was gratifying.    'What do you know about bounds?' said Charteris.    'I know you ain't allowed to come 'ere, and you'll get it 'ot from your  master for coming.'    'Ah, but he won't know. I shan't tell him, and I'm sure you will  respect my secret.'    Charteris smiled in a winning manner.    'Ho!' said the man, 'Ho indeed!'    There is something very clinching about the word 'Ho'. It seems  definitely to apply the closure to any argument. At least, I have never  yet met anyone who could tell me the suitable repartee.    'Well,' said Charteris affably, 'don't let me keep you. I must be going  on.'    'Ho!' observed the man once more. 'Ho indeed!'    'That's a wonderfully shrewd remark,' said Charteris. 'I can see that,  but I wish you'd tell me exactly what it means.'    'You're out of bounds.'    'Your mind seems to run in a groove. You can't get off that bounds  business. How do you know Stapleton's out of bounds?'    'I have made enquiries,' said the man darkly.    'By Jove,' said Charteris delightedly, 'this is splendid. You're a  regular sleuth-hound. I dare say you've found out my name and House  too?'    'I may 'ave,' said the man, 'or I may not 'ave.'    'Well, now you mention it, I suppose one of the two contingencies is  probable. Well, I'm awfully glad to have met you. Good-bye. I must be  going.'    'You're goin' with me.'    'Arm in arm?'    'I don't want to _'ave_ to take you.'    'No,' said Charteris, 'I should jolly well advise you not to try. This  is my way.'    He walked on till he came to the road that led to St Austin's. The  secretary of the Old Crockfordians stalked beside him with determined  stride.    'Now,' said Charteris, when they were on the road, 'you mustn't mind if  I walk rather fast. I'm in a hurry.'    Charteris's idea of walking rather fast was to dash off down the road  at quarter-mile pace. The move took the man by surprise, but, after a  moment, he followed with much panting. It was evident that he was not  in training. Charteris began to feel that the walk home might be  amusing in its way. After they had raced some three hundred yards he  slowed down to a walk again. It was at this point that his companion  evinced a desire to do the rest of the journey with a hand on the  collar of his coat.    'If you touch me,' observed Charteris with a surprising knowledge of  legal _minutiae_, 'it'll be a technical assault, and you'll get  run in; and you'll get beans anyway if you try it on.'    The man reconsidered matters, and elected not to try it on.    Half a mile from the College Charteris began to walk rather fast again.  He was a good half-miler, and his companion was bad at every distance.  After a game struggle he dropped to the rear, and finished a hundred  yards behind in considerable straits. Charteris shot in at Merevale's  door with five minutes to spare, and went up to his study to worry  Welch by telling him about it.    'Welch, you remember the Bargee who scragged Tony? Well, there have  been all sorts of fresh developments. He's just been pacing me all the  way from Stapleton.'    'Stapleton! Have you been to Stapleton? Did Merevale give you leave?'    'No. I didn't ask him.'    'You _are_ an idiot. And now this Bargee man will go straight to  the Old Man and run you in. I wonder you didn't think of that.'    'Curious I didn't.'    'I suppose he saw you come in here?'    'Rather. He couldn't have had a better view if he'd paid for a seat.  Half a second; I must just run up with these volumes to Tony.'    When he came back he found Welch more serious than ever.    'I told you so,' said Welch. 'You're to go to the Old Man at once. He's  just sent over for you. I say, look here, if it's only lines I don't  mind doing some of them, if you like.'    Charteris was quite touched by this sporting offer.    'It's awfully good of you,' he said, 'but it doesn't matter, really. I  shall be all right.'    Ten minutes later he returned, beaming.    'Well,' said Welch, 'what's he given you?'    'Only his love, to give to you. It was this way. He first asked me if I  wasn't perfectly aware that Stapleton was out of bounds. \"Sir,\" says I,  \"I've known it from childhood's earliest hour.\" \"Ah,\" says he to me,  \"did Mr Merevale give you leave to go in this afternoon?\" \"No,\" says I,  \"I never consulted the gent you mention.\"'    'Well?'    'Then he ragged me for ten minutes, and finally told me I must go into  extra the next two Saturdays.'    'I thought so.'    'Ah, but mark the sequel. When he had finished, I said that I was sorry  I had mistaken the rules, but I had thought that a chap was allowed to  go into Stapleton if he got leave from a master. \"But you said that Mr  Merevale did not give you leave,\" said he. \"Friend of my youth,\" I  replied courteously, \"you are perfectly correct. As always. Mr Merevale  did not give me leave, but,\" I added suavely, \"Mr Dacre did.\" And I  came away, chanting hymns of triumph in a mellow baritone, and leaving  him in a dead faint on the sofa. And the Bargee, who was present during  the conflict, swiftly and silently vanished away, his morale  considerably shattered. And that, my gentle Welch,' concluded Charteris  cheerfully, 'put me one up. So pass the biscuits, and let us rejoice if  we never rejoice again.'

'Heard them oftener than I saw them.'    'They didn't book you?'    'Rather fancy one of them saw me, but I got away all right.'    'Find the place pretty lively?'    'Pretty fair.'    'Stay there long?'    'Not very.'    'No. Thought you wouldn't. What do you say to a small ice? There's time  before school.'    'Thanks. Are you flush?'    'Flush isn't the word for it. I'm a plutocrat.'    'Uncle came out fairly strong then?'    'Rather. To the tune of one sovereign, cash. He's a jolly good sort, my  uncle.'    'So it seems,' said Barrett.    The meeting then adjourned to the School shop, Barrett enjoying his ice  all the more for the thought that his secret still was a secret. A  thing which it would in all probability have ceased to be, had he been  rash enough to confide it to K. St H. Grey, who, whatever his other  merits, was very far from being the safest sort of confidant. His usual  practice was to speak first, and to think, if at all, afterwards.          [10]    MR THOMPSON INVESTIGATES      The Pavilion burglary was discussed in other places besides Charteris'  study. In the Masters' Common Room the matter came in for its full  share of comment. The masters were, as at most schools, divided into  the athletic and non-athletic, and it was for the former class that the  matter possessed most interest. If it had been that apple of the  College Library's eye, the original MS. of St Austin's private diary,  or even that lesser treasure, the black-letter Eucalyptides, that had  disappeared, the elder portion of the staff would have had a great deal  to say upon the subject. But, apart from the excitement caused by the  strangeness of such an occurrence, the theft of a couple of Sports  prizes had little interest for them.    On the border-line between these two castes came Mr Thompson, the  Master of the Sixth Form, spelt with a _p_ and no relation to the  genial James or the amiable Allen, with the former of whom, indeed, he  was on very indifferent terms of friendship. Mr Thompson, though an  excellent classic, had no knowledge of the inwardness of the Human Boy.  He expected every member of his form not only to be earnest--which very  few members of a Sixth Form are--but also to communicate his innermost  thoughts to him. His aim was to be their confidant, the wise friend to  whom they were to bring their troubles and come for advice. He was, in  fact, poor man, the good young master. Now, it is generally the case at  school that troubles are things to be worried through alone, and any  attempt at interference is usually resented. Mr Thompson had asked Jim  to tea, and, while in the very act of passing him the muffins, had  embarked on a sort of unofficial sermon, winding up by inviting  confidences. Jim had naturally been first flippant, and then rude, and  relations had been strained ever since.    'It must have been a professional,' alleged Perkins, the master of the  Upper Fourth. 'If it hadn't been for the fact of the money having been  stolen as well as the cups, I should have put it down to one of our  fellows.'    'My dear Perkins,' expostulated Merevale.    'My dear Merevale, my entire form is capable of any crime except the  theft of money. A boy might have taken the cups for a joke, or just for  the excitement of the thing, meaning to return them in time for the  Sports. But the two pounds knocks that on the head. It must have been a  professional.'    'I always said that the Pavilion was a very unsafe place in which to  keep anything of value,' said Mr Thompson.    'You were profoundly right, Thompson,' replied Perkins. 'You deserve a  diploma.'    'This business is rather in your line, Thompson,' said Merevale. 'You  must bring your powers to bear on the subject, and scent out the  criminal.'    Mr Thompson took a keen pride in his powers of observation. He would  frequently observe, like the lamented Sherlock Holmes, the vital  necessity of taking notice of trifles. The daily life of a Sixth Form  master at a big public school does not afford much scope for the  practice of the detective art, but Mr Thompson had once detected a  piece of cribbing, when correcting some Latin proses for the master of  the Lower Third, solely by the exercise of his powers of observation,  and he had never forgotten it. He burned to add another scalp to his  collection, and this Pavilion burglary seemed peculiarly suited to his  talents. He had given the matter his attention, and, as far as he could  see, everything pointed to the fact that skilled hands had been at  work.    From eleven until half-past twelve that day, the Sixth were doing an  unseen examination under the eye of the Headmaster, and Mr Thompson was  consequently off duty. He took advantage of this to stroll down to the  Pavilion and make a personal inspection of the first room, from which  what were left of the prizes had long been removed to a place of  safety.    He was making his way to the place where the ground-man was usually to  be found, with a view to obtaining the keys, when he noticed that the  door was already open, and on going thither he came upon Biffen, the  ground-man, in earnest conversation with a stranger.    'Morning, sir,' said the ground-man. He was on speaking terms with most  of the masters and all the boys. Then, to his companion, 'This is Mr  Thompson, one of our masters.'    'Morning, sir,' said the latter. 'Weather keeps up. I am Inspector  Roberts, Scotland Yard. But I think we're in for rain soon. Yes. 'Fraid  so. Been asked to look into this business, Mr Thompson. Queer  business.'    'Very. Might I ask--I am very interested in this kind of thing--whether  you have arrived at any conclusions yet?'    The detective eyed him thoughtfully, as if he were hunting for the  answer to a riddle.    'No. Not yet. Nothing definite.'    'I presume you take it for granted it was the work of a professional  burglar.'    'No. No. Take nothing for granted. Great mistake. Prejudices one way or  other great mistake. But, I think, yes, I think it was probably--almost  certainly--_not_ done by a professional.'    Mr Thompson looked rather blank at this. It shook his confidence in his  powers of deduction.    'But,' he expostulated. 'Surely no one but a practised burglar would  have taken a pane of glass out so--ah--neatly?'    Inspector Roberts rubbed a finger thoughtfully round the place where  the glass had been. Then he withdrew it, and showed a small cut from  which the blood was beginning to drip.    'Do you notice anything peculiar about that cut?' he enquired.    Mr Thompson did not. Nor did the ground-man.    'Look carefully. Now do you see? No? Well, it's not a clean cut.  Ragged. Very ragged. Now if a professional had cut that pane out he  wouldn't have left it jagged like that. No. He would have used a  diamond. Done the job neatly.'    This destroyed another of Mr Thompson's premises. He had taken it for  granted that a diamond had been used.    'Oh!' he said, 'was that pane not cut by a diamond; what did the  burglar use, then?'    'No. No diamond. Diamond would have left smooth surface. Smooth as a  razor edge. This is like a saw. Amateurish work. Can't say for certain,  but probably done with a chisel.'    'With a chisel? Surely not.'    'Yes. Probably with a chisel. Probably the man knocked the pane out  with one blow, then removed all the glass so as to make it look like  the work of an old hand. Very good idea, but amateurish. I am told that  three cups have been taken. Could you tell me how long they had been in  the Pavilion?'    Mr Thompson considered.    'Well,' he said. 'Of course it's difficult to remember exactly, but I  think they were placed there soon after one o'clock the day before  yesterday.'    'Ah! And the robbery took place yesterday in the early morning, or the  night before?'    'Yes.'    'Is the Pavilion the usual place to keep the prizes for the Sports?'    'No, it is not. They were only put there temporarily. The Board Room,  where they are usually kept, and which is in the main buildings of the  School, happened to be needed until the next day. Most of us were very  much against leaving them in the Pavilion, but it was thought that no  harm could come to them if they were removed next day.'    'But they were removed that night, which made a great difference,' said  Mr Roberts, chuckling at his mild joke. 'I see. Then I suppose none  outside the School knew that they were not in their proper place?'    'I imagine not.'    'Just so. Knocks the idea of professional work on the head. None of the  regular trade can have known this room held so much silver for one  night. No regular would look twice at a cricket pavilion under ordinary  circumstances. Therefore, it must have been somebody who had something  to do with the School. One of the boys, perhaps.'    'Really, I do not think that probable.'    'You can't tell. Never does to form hasty conclusions. Boy might have  done it for many reasons. Some boys would have done it for the sake of  the excitement. That, perhaps, is the least possible explanation. But  you get boy kleptomaniacs just as much in proportion as grown-up  kleptomaniacs. I knew a man. Had a son. Couldn't keep him away from  anything valuable. Had to take him away in a hurry from three schools,  good schools, too.'    'Really? What became of him? He did not come to us, I suppose?'    'No. Somebody advised the father to send him to one of those  North-Country schools where they flog. Great success. Stole some money.  Got flogged, instead of expelled. Did it again with same result.  Gradually got tired of it. Reformed character now.... I don't say it is  a boy, mind you. Most probably not. Only say it may be.'    All the while he was talking, his eyes were moving restlessly round the  room. He came to the window through which Jim had effected his  entrance, and paused before the"]]]
