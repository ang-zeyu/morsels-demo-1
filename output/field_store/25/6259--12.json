As he  sailed northward he was struck with the wonderful vegetation of the  American coast, the beautiful forest of pine and cypress and other  trees, unknown to him, covered with tangled vines as prolific as the  vines of Lombardy. Verrazano's voyage and his landings can be traced  all the way from Carolina to the northern part of New England. He noted  the wonderful harbour at the mouth of the Hudson, skirted the coast  eastward from that point, and then followed northward along the shores  of Massachusetts and Maine. Beyond this Verrazano seems to have made no  landings, but he followed the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. He  sailed, so he says, as far as fifty degrees north, or almost to the  Strait of Belle Isle. Then he turned eastward, headed out into the  great ocean, and reached France in safety. Unfortunately, Verrazano did  not write a detailed account of that part of his voyage which related  to Canadian waters. But there is no doubt that his glowing descriptions  must have done much to stimulate the French to further effort.  Unhappily, at the moment of his return, his royal master was deeply  engaged in a disastrous invasion of Italy, where he shortly met the  crushing defeat at Pavia (1525) which left him a captive in the hands  of his Spanish rival. His absence crippled French enterprise, and  Verrazano's explorations were not followed up till a change of fortune  enabled Francis to send out the famous expedition of Jacques Cartier.    One other expedition to Canada deserves brief mention before we come to  Cartier's crowning discovery of the St Lawrence river. This is the  voyage of Stephen Gomez, who was sent out in the year 1524. by Charles  V, the rival of Francis I. He spent about ten months on the voyage,  following much the same course as Verrazano, but examining with far  greater care the coast of Nova Scotia and the territory about the  opening of the Gulf of St Lawrence. His course can be traced from the  Penobscot river in Maine to the island of Cape Breton. He entered the  Bay of Fundy, and probably went far enough to realize from its tides,  rising sometimes to a height of sixty or seventy feet, that its farther  end could not be free, and that it could not furnish an open passage to  the Western Sea. Running north-east along the shore of Nova Scotia,  Gomez sailed through the Gut of Canso, thus learning that Cape Breton  was an island. He named it the Island of St John-or, rather, he  transferred to it this name, which the map-makers had already used.  Hence it came about that the 'Island of St John' occasions great  confusion in the early geography of Canada. The first map-makers who  used it secured their information indirectly, we may suppose, from the  Cabot voyages and the fishermen who frequented the coast. They marked  it as an island lying in the 'Bay of the Bretons,' which had come to be  the name for the open mouth of the Gulf of St Lawrence. Gomez, however,  used the name for Cape Breton island. Later on, the name was applied to  what is now Prince Edward Island. All this is only typical of the  difficulties in understanding the accounts of the early voyages to  America. Gomez duly returned to the port of Corunna in June 1525.    We may thus form some idea of the general position of American  exploration and discovery at the time when Cartier made his momentous  voyages. The maritime nations of Europe, in searching for a passage to  the half-mythical empires of Asia, had stumbled on a great continent.  At first they thought it Asia itself. Gradually they were realizing  that this was not Asia, but an outlying land that lay between Europe  and Asia and that must be passed by the navigator before Cathay and  Cipango could rise upon the horizon. But the new continent was vast in  extent. It blocked the westward path from pole to pole. With each  voyage, too, the resources and the native beauty of the new land became  more apparent. The luxuriant islands of the West Indies, and the Aztec  empire of Mexico, were already bringing wealth and grandeur to the  monarchy of Spain. South of Mexico it had been already found that the  great barrier of the continent extended to the cold tempestuous seas of  the Antarctic region. Magellan's voyage (1519-22) had proved indeed  that by rounding South America the way was open to the spice islands of  the east. But the route was infinitely long and arduous. The hope of a  shorter passage by the north beckoned the explorer. Of this north  country nothing but its coast was known as yet. Cabot and the fishermen  had found a land of great forests, swept by the cold and leaden seas of  the Arctic, and holding its secret clasped in the iron grip of the  northern ice. The Corte-Reals, Verrazano, and Gomez had looked upon the  endless panorama of the Atlantic coast of North America--the glorious  forests draped with tangled vines extending to the sanded beaches of  the sea--the wide inlets round the mouths of mighty rivers moving  silent and mysterious from the heart of the unknown continent. Here and  there a painted savage showed the bright feathers of his headgear as he  lurked in the trees of the forest or stood, in fearless curiosity,  gazing from the shore at the white-winged ships of the strange  visitants from the sky. But for the most part all, save the sounds of  nature, was silence and mystery. The waves thundered upon the sanded  beach of Carolina and lashed in foam about the rocks of the iron coasts  of New England and the New Found Land. The forest mingled its murmurs  with the waves, and, as the sun sank behind the unknown hills, wafted  its perfume to the anchored ships that rode upon the placid bosom of  the evening sea. And beyond all this was mystery--the mystery of the  unknown East, the secret of the pathway that must lie somewhere hidden  in the bays and inlets of the continent of silent beauty, and above all  the mysterious sense of a great history still to come for this new land  itself--a sense of the murmuring of many voices caught as the undertone  of the rustling of the forest leaves, but rising at last to the mighty  sound of the vast civilization that in the centuries to come should  pour into the silent wildernesses of America.    To such a land--to such a mystery--sailed forth Jacques Cartier,  discoverer of Canada.        BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE    The Icelandic sagas contain legends of a discovery of America before  Columbus. Benjamin de Costa, in his 'Pre-Columbian Discovery of  America', has given translations of a number of these legends. Other  works bearing on this mythical period are: A. M. Reeves's 'The Finding  of Wineland the Good'; J. E. Olson's 'The Voyages of the Northmen' in  Vol. I of the 'Original Narrative of Early American History', edited by  J. F. Jameson; Fridtjof Nansen's 'In Northern Mists'; and John Fiske's  'The Discovery of America'. A number of general histories have chapters  bearing on pre-Columbian discovery; the most accessible of these are:  Justin Winsor's 'Narrative and Critical History of America';  Charlevoix's 'Histoire et description generale de la Nouvelle France'  (1744), translated with notes by J. G. Shea (1886); Henry Harrisse's  'Discovery of North America'; and the 'Conquest of Canada', by the  author of 'Hochelaga'.    There are numerous works in the Spanish, French, Italian, and English  languages dealing with Columbus and his time. Pre-eminent among the  latter are: Irving's 'Life of Columbus'; Winsor's 'Christopher Columbus  and how he Received and Imparted the Spirit of Discovery'; Helps's  'Life of Columbus'; Prescott's 'History of Ferdinand and Isabella';  Crompton's 'Life of Columbus'; St John's 'Life of Columbus'; and  Major's 'Select Letters of Columbus' (a Hakluyt Society publication).  Likewise in every important work which deals with the early history of  North or South America, Columbus and his voyages are discussed.    The literature dealing with the Cabots is quite as voluminous as that  bearing on Columbus. Henry Harrisse's 'John Cabot, the Discoverer of  North America and Sebastian, his Son; a Chapter of the Maritime History  of England under the Tudors, 1496-1557', is a most exhaustive work.  Other authoritative works on the Cabots are Nichols's 'Remarkable Life,  Adventures, and Discoveries of Sebastian Cabot', in which an effort is  made to give the chief glory of the discovery of America not to John  Cabot, but to his son Sebastian; Dawson's 'The Voyages of the Cabots,  1497 and 1498', 'The Voyages of the Cabots, a Sequel', and 'The Voyages  of the Cabots, Latest Phases of the Controversy', in 'Transactions  Royal Society of Canada'; Biddle's 'Memoir of Sebastian Cabot';  Beazley's 'John and Sebastian Cabot, The Discovery of North America';  and Weare's 'Cabot's Discovery of America'.    A number of European writers have made able studies of the work of  Verrazano, and two American scholars have contributed valuable works on  that explorer's life and achievements; these are, De Costa's 'Verrazano  the Explorer: a Vindication of his Letter and Voyage', and Murphy's  'The Voyage of Verrazano'.    In addition to the general histories already mentioned, the following  works contain much information on the voyages of the forerunners of  Jacques Cartier: Parkman's 'Pioneers of France'; Kohl's 'Discovery of  Maine'; Woodbury's 'Relation of the Fisheries to the Discovery of North  America' (in this work it is claimed that the Basques antedated the  Cabots); Dawson's 'The St Lawrence Basin and Its Borderlands'; Weise's  'The Discoveries of America'; 'The Journal of Christopher Columbus',  and 'Documents relating to the Voyages of John Cabot and Gaspar  Corte-Real', translated with Notes and an Introduction by Sir Clements  R. Markham; and Biggar's 'The Precursors of Jacques Cartier,  1497-1534'. This last work is essential to the student of the early  voyages to America. It contains documents, many published for the first  time,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],[0,"The Intrusion of Jimmy (#13)"],[1,"'re  fearfully particular about that sort of thing in England.\"    \"Dey's to de bad,\" said the baffled disciple of Beau Brummel, with  deep discontent.    \"And there's just one more thing, Spike. I know you'll excuse my  mentioning it. When we're at Dreever Castle, you will find yourself  within reach of a good deal of silver and other things. Would it be  too much to ask you to forget your professional instincts? I  mentioned this before in a general sort of way, but this is a  particular case.\"    \"Ain't I to get busy at all, den?\" queried Spike.    \"Not so much as a salt-spoon,\" said Jimmy, firmly. \"Now, we'll  whistle a cab, and go and choose you some more clothes.\"    Accompanied by Spike, who came within an ace of looking almost  respectable in new blue serge (\"Small Gent's\"--off the peg), Jimmy  arrived at Paddington Station with a quarter of an hour to spare.  Lord Dreever appeared ten minutes later, accompanied by a man of  about Jimmy's age. He was tall and thin, with cold eyes and tight,  thin lips. His clothes fitted him in the way clothes do fit one man  in a thousand. They were the best part of him. His general  appearance gave one the idea that his meals did him little good, and  his meditations rather less. He had practically no conversation.    This was Lord Dreever's friend, Hargate. Lord Dreever made the  introductions; but, even as they shook hands, Jimmy had an  impression that he had seen the man before. Yet, where or in what  circumstances he could not remember. Hargate appeared to have no  recollection of him, so he did not mention the matter. A man who has  led a wandering life often sees faces that come back to him later  on, absolutely detached from their context. He might merely have  passed Lord Dreever's friend on the street. But Jimmy had an idea  that the other had figured in some episode which at the moment had  had an importance. What that episode was had escaped him. He  dismissed the thing from his mind. It was not worth harrying his  memory about.    Judicious tipping secured the three a compartment to themselves.  Hargate, having read the evening paper, went to sleep in the far  corner. Jimmy and Lord Dreever, who sat opposite each other, fell  into a desultory conversation.    After awhile, Lord Dreever's remarks took a somewhat intimate turn.  Jimmy was one of those men whose manner invites confidences. His  lordship began to unburden his soul of certain facts relating to the  family.    \"Have you ever met my Uncle Thomas?\" he inquired. \"You know Blunt's  Stores? Well, he's Blunt. It's a company now, but he still runs it.  He married my aunt. You'll meet him at Dreever.\"    Jimmy said he would be delighted.    \"I bet you won't,\" said the last of the Dreevers, with candor. \"He's  a frightful man--the limit. Always fussing round like a hen. Gives  me a fearful time, I can tell you. Look here, I don't mind telling  you--we're pals--he's dead set on my marrying a rich girl.\"    \"Well, that sounds all right. There are worse hobbies. Any  particular rich girl?\"    \"There's always one. He sicks me on to one after another. Quite nice  girls, you know, some of them; only, I want to marry somebody else,  that girl you saw me with at the Savoy.\"    \"Why don't you tell your uncle?\"    \"He'd have a fit. She hasn't a penny; nor have I, except what I get  from him. Of course, this is strictly between ourselves.\"    \"Of course.\"    \"I know everybody thinks there's money attached to the title; but  there isn't, not a penny. When my Aunt Julia married Sir Thomas, the  whole frightful show was pretty well in pawn. So, you see how it  is.\"    \"Ever think of work?\" asked Jimmy.    \"Work?\" said Lord Dreever, reflectively. \"Well, you know, I  shouldn't mind work, only I'm dashed if I can see what I could do. I  shouldn't know how. Nowadays, you want a fearful specialized  education, and so on. Tell you what, though, I shouldn't mind the  diplomatic service. One of these days, I shall have a dash at asking  my uncle to put up the money. I believe I shouldn't be half-bad at  that. I'm rather a quick sort of chap at times, you know. Lots of  fellows have said so.\"    He cleared his throat modestly, and proceeded.    \"It isn't only my Uncle Thomas,\" he said. \"There's Aunt Julia, too.  She's about as much the limit as he is. I remember, when I was a  kid, she was always sitting on me. She does still. Wait till you see  her. Sort of woman who makes you feel that your hands are the color  of tomatoes and the size of legs of mutton, if you know what I mean.  And talks as if she were biting at you. Frightful!\"    Having unburdened himself of these criticisms, Lord Dreever yawned,  leaned back, and was presently asleep.    It was about an hour later that the train, which had been taking  itself less seriously for some time, stopping at stations of quite  minor importance and generally showing a tendency to dawdle, halted  again. A board with the legend, \"Dreever,\" in large letters showed  that they had reached their destination.    The station-master informed Lord Dreever that her ladyship had come  to meet the train in the motorcar, and was now waiting in the road  outside.    Lord Dreever's jaw fell.    \"Oh, lord!\" he said. \"She's probably motored in to get the afternoon  letters. That means, she's come in the runabout, and there's only  room for two of us in that. I forgot to telegraph that you were  coming, Pitt. I only wired about Hargate. Dash it, I shall have to  walk.\"    His fears proved correct. The car at the station door was small. It  was obviously designed to seat four only.    Lord Dreever introduced Hargate and Jimmy to the statuesque lady in  the tonneau; and then there was an awkward silence.    At this point, Spike came up, chuckling amiably, with a magazine in  his hand.    \"Gee!\" said Spike. \"Say, boss, de mug what wrote dis piece must have  bin livin' out in de woods. Say, dere's a gazebo what wants to swipe  de heroine's jools what's locked in a drawer. So, dis mug, what 'do  you t'ink he does?\" Spike laughed shortly, in professional scorn.  \"Why--\"    \"Is this gentleman a friend of yours, Spennie?\" inquired Lady  Julia politely, eying the red-haired speaker coldly.    \"It's--\" Spennie looked appealingly at Jimmy.    \"It's my man,\" said Jimmy. \"Spike,\" he added in an undertone, \"to  the woods. Chase yourself. Fade away.\"    \"Sure,\" said the abashed Spike. \"Dat's right. It ain't up to me to  come buttin' in. Sorry, boss. Sorry, gents. Sorry loidy. Me for de  tall grass.\"    \"There's a luggage-cart of sorts,\" said Lord Dreever, pointing.    \"Sure,\" said Spike, affably. He trotted away.    \"Jump in, Pitt,\" said Lord Dreever. \"I'm going to walk.\"    \"No, I'll walk,\" said Jimmy. \"I'd rather. I want a bit of exercise.  Which way do I go?\"    \"Frightfully good of you, old chap,\" said Lord Dreever. \"Sure you  don't mind? I do bar walking. Right-ho! You keep straight on.\"    He sat down in the tonneau by his aunt's side. The last Jimmy saw  was a hasty vision of him engaged in earnest conversation with Lady  Julia. He did not seem to be enjoying himself. Nobody is at his best  in conversation with a lady whom he knows to be possessed of a firm  belief in the weakness of his intellect. A prolonged conversation  with Lady Julia always made Lord Dreever feel as if he were being  tied into knots.    Jimmy watched them out of sight, and started to follow at a  leisurely pace. It certainly was an ideal afternoon for a country  walk. The sun was just hesitating whether to treat the time as  afternoon or evening. Eventually, it decided that it was evening,  and moderated its beams. After London, the country was deliciously  fresh and cool. Jimmy felt an unwonted content. It seemed to him  just then that the only thing worth doing in the world was to settle  down somewhere with three acres and a cow, and become pastoral.    There was a marked lack of traffic on the road. Once he met a cart,  and once a flock of sheep with a friendly dog. Sometimes, a rabbit  would dash out into the road, stop to listen, and dart into the  opposite hedge, all hind-legs and white scut. But, except for these,  he was alone in the world.    And, gradually, there began to be borne in upon him the conviction  that he had lost his way.    It is difficult to judge distance when one is walking, but it  certainly seemed to Jimmy that he must have covered five miles by  this time. He must have mistaken the way. He had doubtless come  straight. He could not have come straighter. On the other hand, it  would be quite in keeping with the cheap substitute which served the  Earl of Dreever in place of a mind that he should have forgotten to  mention some important turning. Jimmy sat down by the roadside.    As he sat, there came to him from down the road the sound of a  horse's feet, trotting. He got up. Here was somebody at last who  would direct him.    The sound came nearer. The horse turned the corner; and Jimmy saw  with surprise that it bore no rider.    \"Hullo?\" he said. \"Accident? And, by Jove, a side-saddle!\"    The curious part of it was that the horse appeared in no way a wild  horse. It gave the impression of being out for a little trot on its  own account, a sort of equine constitutional.    Jimmy stopped the horse, and led it back the way it had come. As he  turned the bend in the road, he saw a girl in a riding-habit running  toward him. She stopped running when she caught sight of him, and  slowed down to a walk.    \"Thank you ever so much,\" she said, taking the reins from him.  \"Dandy, you naughty old thing! I got off to pick up my crop, and he  ran away.\"    Jimmy looked at her flushed, smiling face, and stood staring.    It was Molly McEachern.          CHAPTER XII    MAKING A START      Self-possession was one of Jimmy's leading characteristics, but for  the moment he found himself speechless. This girl had been occupying  his thoughts for so long that--in his mind--he had grown very  intimate with her. It"]]]
