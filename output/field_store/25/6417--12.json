These are indeed to be considered as blanks in the grand lottery of  time. We therefore, who are the registers of that lottery, shall  imitate those sagacious persons who deal in that which is drawn at  Guildhall, and who never trouble the public with the many blanks they  dispose of; but when a great prize happens to be drawn, the newspapers  are presently filled with it, and the world is sure to be informed at  whose office it was sold: indeed, commonly two or three different  offices lay claim to the honour of having disposed of it; by which, I  suppose, the adventurers are given to understand that certain brokers  are in the secrets of Fortune, and indeed of her cabinet council.    My reader then is not to be surprized, if, in the course of this work,  he shall find some chapters very short, and others altogether as long;  some that contain only the time of a single day, and others that  comprise years; in a word, if my history sometimes seems to stand  still, and sometimes to fly. For all which I shall not look on myself  as accountable to any court of critical jurisdiction whatever: for as  I am, in reality, the founder of a new province of writing, so I am at  liberty to make what laws I please therein. And these laws, my  readers, whom I consider as my subjects, are bound to believe in and  to obey; with which that they may readily and cheerfully comply, I do  hereby assure them that I shall principally regard their ease and  advantage in all such institutions: for I do not, like a _jure divino_  tyrant, imagine that they are my slaves, or my commodity. I am,  indeed, set over them for their own good only, and was created for  their use, and not they for mine. Nor do I doubt, while I make their  interest the great rule of my writings, they will unanimously concur  in supporting my dignity, and in rendering me all the honour I shall  deserve or desire.        Chapter ii.    Religious cautions against showing too much favour to bastards; and a  great discovery made by Mrs Deborah Wilkins.      Eight months after the celebration of the nuptials between Captain  Blifil and Miss Bridget Allworthy, a young lady of great beauty,  merit, and fortune, was Miss Bridget, by reason of a fright, delivered  of a fine boy. The child was indeed to all appearances perfect; but  the midwife discovered it was born a month before its full time.    Though the birth of an heir by his beloved sister was a circumstance  of great joy to Mr Allworthy, yet it did not alienate his affections  from the little foundling, to whom he had been godfather, had given  his own name of Thomas, and whom he had hitherto seldom failed of  visiting, at least once a day, in his nursery.    He told his sister, if she pleased, the new-born infant should be bred  up together with little Tommy; to which she consented, though with  some little reluctance: for she had truly a great complacence for her  brother; and hence she had always behaved towards the foundling with  rather more kindness than ladies of rigid virtue can sometimes bring  themselves to show to these children, who, however innocent, may be  truly called the living monuments of incontinence.    The captain could not so easily bring himself to bear what he  condemned as a fault in Mr Allworthy. He gave him frequent hints, that  to adopt the fruits of sin, was to give countenance to it. He quoted  several texts (for he was well read in Scripture), such as, _He visits  the sins of the fathers upon the children; and the fathers have eaten  sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge_,&c. Whence he  argued the legality of punishing the crime of the parent on the  bastard. He said, \"Though the law did not positively allow the  destroying such base-born children, yet it held them to be the  children of nobody; that the Church considered them as the children of  nobody; and that at the best, they ought to be brought up to the  lowest and vilest offices of the commonwealth.\"    Mr Allworthy answered to all this, and much more, which the captain  had urged on this subject, \"That, however guilty the parents might be,  the children were certainly innocent: that as to the texts he had  quoted, the former of them was a particular denunciation against the  Jews, for the sin of idolatry, of relinquishing and hating their  heavenly King; and the latter was parabolically spoken, and rather  intended to denote the certain and necessary consequences of sin, than  any express judgment against it. But to represent the Almighty as  avenging the sins of the guilty on the innocent, was indecent, if not  blasphemous, as it was to represent him acting against the first  principles of natural justice, and against the original notions of  right and wrong, which he himself had implanted in our minds; by which  we were to judge not only in all matters which were not revealed, but  even of the truth of revelation itself. He said he knew many held the  same principles with the captain on this head; but he was himself  firmly convinced to the contrary, and would provide in the same manner  for this poor infant, as if a legitimate child had had fortune to have  been found in the same place.\"    While the captain was taking all opportunities to press these and such  like arguments, to remove the little foundling from Mr Allworthy's, of  whose fondness for him he began to be jealous, Mrs Deborah had made a  discovery, which, in its event, threatened at least to prove more  fatal to poor Tommy than all the reasonings of the captain.    Whether the insatiable curiosity of this good woman had carried her on  to that business, or whether she did it to confirm herself in the good  graces of Mrs Blifil, who, notwithstanding her outward behaviour to  the foundling, frequently abused the infant in private, and her  brother too, for his fondness to it, I will not determine; but she had  now, as she conceived, fully detected the father of the foundling.    Now, as this was a discovery of great consequence, it may be necessary  to trace it from the fountain-head. We shall therefore very minutely  lay open those previous matters by which it was produced; and for that  purpose we shall be obliged to reveal all the secrets of a little  family with which my reader is at present entirely unacquainted; and  of which the oeconomy was so rare and extraordinary, that I fear it  will shock the utmost credulity of many married persons.        Chapter iii.    The description of a domestic government founded upon rules directly  contrary to those of Aristotle.      My reader may please to remember he hath been informed that Jenny  Jones had lived some years with a certain schoolmaster, who had, at  her earnest desire, instructed her in Latin, in which, to do justice  to her genius, she had so improved herself, that she was become a  better scholar than her master.    Indeed, though this poor man had undertaken a profession to which  learning must be allowed necessary, this was the least of his  commendations. He was one of the best-natured fellows in the world,  and was, at the same time, master of so much pleasantry and humour,  that he was reputed the wit of the country; and all the neighbouring  gentlemen were so desirous of his company, that as denying was not his  talent, he spent much time at their houses, which he might, with more  emolument, have spent in his school.    It may be imagined that a gentleman so qualified and so disposed, was  in no danger of becoming formidable to the learned seminaries of Eton  or Westminster. To speak plainly, his scholars were divided into two  classes: in the upper of which was a young gentleman, the son of a  neighbouring squire, who, at the age of seventeen, was just entered  into his Syntaxis; and in the lower was a second son of the same  gentleman, who, together with seven parish-boys, was learning to read  and write.    The stipend arising hence would hardly have indulged the schoolmaster  in the luxuries of life, had he not added to this office those of  clerk and barber, and had not Mr Allworthy added to the whole an  annuity of ten pounds, which the poor man received every Christmas,  and with which he was enabled to cheer his heart during that sacred  festival.    Among his other treasures, the pedagogue had a wife, whom he had  married out of Mr Allworthy's kitchen for her fortune, viz., twenty  pounds, which she had there amassed.    This woman was not very amiable in her person. Whether she sat to my  friend Hogarth, or no, I will not determine; but she exactly resembled  the young woman who is pouring out her mistress's tea in the third  picture of the Harlot's Progress. She was, besides, a profest follower  of that noble sect founded by Xantippe of old; by means of which she  became more formidable in the school than her husband; for, to confess  the truth, he was never master there, or anywhere else, in her  presence.    Though her countenance did not denote much natural sweetness of  temper, yet this was, perhaps, somewhat soured by a circumstance which  generally poisons matrimonial felicity; for children are rightly  called the pledges of love; and her husband, though they had been  married nine years, had given her no such pledges; a default for which  he had no excuse, either from age or health, being not yet thirty  years old, and what they call a jolly brisk young man.    Hence arose another evil, which produced no little uneasiness to the  poor pedagogue, of whom she maintained so constant a jealousy, that he  durst hardly speak to one woman in the parish; for the least degree of  civility, or even correspondence, with any female, was sure to bring  his wife upon her back, and his own.    In order to guard herself against matrimonial injuries in her own  house, as she kept one maid-servant, she always took care to chuse her  out of that order of females whose faces are taken as a kind of  security for their virtue;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6603"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage : 600-1776 King Aethelbert - King George III (#13)"],[1,"in daily life, especially if worshipped.  Saints such as Bede and Hilda performed miracles, especially ones  of curing. Their spirits could be contacted through their relics,  which rested at the altars of churches. When someone was said to  have the devil in him, people took it quite literally. A real Jack  Frost nipped noses and fingers and made the ground too hard to  work. Little people, elves, trolls, and fairies inhabited the  fears and imaginings of people. The forest was the mysterious home  of spirits. People prayed to God to help them in their troubles  and from the work of the devil. Since natural causes of events  were unknown, people attributed events to wills like their own.  Illness was thought to be caused by demons. People hung charms  around their neck for cure and treatments of magic and herbs were  given. Some had hallucinogenic effects, which were probably useful  for pain. For instance, the remedy for \"mental vacancy and folly\"  was a drink of \"fennel, agrimony, cockle, and marche\". Blood-  letting by leeches and cautery were used for most maladies, which  were thought to be caused by imbalance of the four bodily humors:  sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic. These four humors  reflected the four basic elements of the world articulated by  Aristotle: air, water, fire, and earth. Blood was hot and moist  like air; phlegm was cold and moist like water; choler or yellow  bile was hot and dry like fire; and melancholy or black bile was  cold and dry like earth. Bede had explained that when blood  predominates, it makes people joyful and glad, sociable, laughing,  and talking a great deal. Phlegm renders them slow, sleepy, and  forgetful. Red cholic makes them thin, though eating much, swift,  bold, wrathful, and agile. Black cholic makes them serious of  settled disposition, even sad. To relieve brain pressure and/or  maybe to exorcise evil spirits, holes were drilled into skulls by  a drill with a metal tip that was caused to turn back and forth by  a strap wrapped around a wooden handle. A king's daughter Edith  inspired a cult of holy wells, whose waters were thought to  alleviate eye conditions. Warmth and rest were also used for  illness. Agrimony boiled in milk was thought to relieve impotence  in men.    It was known that the liver casted out impurities in the blood.  The stages of fetal growth were known. The soul was not thought to  enter a fetus until after the third month, so presumably abortions  within three months were allowable.    The days of the week were Sun day, Moon day, Tiw's day (Viking god  of war), Woden's day (Viking god of victory, master magician,  calmer of storms, and raiser of the dead), Thor's day (Viking god  of thunder), Frig's day (Viking goddess of fertility and growing  things), and Saturn's day (Roman god). Special days of the year  were celebrated: Christmas, the birthday of Jesus Christ; the  twelve days of Yuletide (a Viking tradition) when candles were lit  and houses decorated with evergreen and there were festivities  around the burning of the biggest log available; Plough Monday for  resumption of work after Yuletide; February 14th with a feast  celebrating Saint Valentinus, a Roman bishop martyr who had  married young lovers in secret when marriage was forbidden to  encourage men to fight in war; New Year's Day on March 25th when  seed was sown and people banged on drums and blew horns to banish  spirits who destroy crops with disease; Easter, the day of the  resurrection of Jesus Christ; Whitsunday, celebrating the descent  of the Holy Spirit on the apostles of  Jesus and named for the  white worn by baptismal candidates; May Day when flowers and  greenery was gathered from the woods to decorate houses and  churches, Morris dancers leapt through their villages with bells,  hobby horses, and waving scarves, and people danced around a May  pole holding colorful ribbons tied at the top so they became  entwined around the pole; Lammas on August 1st, when the first  bread baked from the wheat harvest was consecrated; Harvest Home  when the last harvest load was brought home while an effigy of a  goddess was carried with reapers singing and piping behind, and  October 31st, the eve of the Christian designated All Hallow Day,  which then became known as All Hallow Even, or Halloween. People  dressed as demons, hobgoblins, and witches to keep spirits away  from possessing them. Trick or treating began with Christian  beggars asking for \"soul cake\" biscuits in return for praying for  dead relatives. Ticktacktoe and backgammon were played. There were  riddles such as:        I am a strange creature, for I satisfy women ...      I grow very tall, erect in a bed.      I'm hairy underneath. From time to time      A beautiful girl, the brave daughter      Of some fellow dares to hold me      Grips my reddish skin, robs me of my head      And puts me in the pantry. At once that girl      With plaited hair who has confined me      Remembers our meeting. Her eye moistens.      What am I?      An onion.        A man came walking where he knew      She stood in a corner, stepped forwards;      The bold fellow plucked up his own      Skirt by hand, stuck something stiff      Beneath her belt as she stood,      Worked his will. They both wiggled.      The man hurried; his trusty helper      Plied a handy task, but tired      At length, less strong than she,      Weary of the work. Thick beneath      Her belt swelled the thing good men      Praise with their hearts and purses.      What am I?      A milk churn.    The languages of invaders had produced a hybrid language that was  roughly understood throughout the country. The existence of  Europe, Africa, Asia, and India were known. Jerusalem was thought  to be at the center of the world. There was an annual tax of a  penny on every hearth, Peter's pence, to be collected and sent to  the pope in Rome. Ecclesiastical benefices were to pay church-  scot, a payment in lieu of first fruits of the land, to the pope.                                      - The Law -    The king and witan deliberated on the making of new laws, both  secular and spiritual, at the regularly held witanagemot. There  was a standard legal requirement of holding every man accountable,  though expressed in different ways, such as the following three:    Every freeman who does not hold land must find a lord to answer  for him. The act of homage was symbolized by holding his hands  together between those of his lord. Every lord shall be personally  responsible as surety for the men of his household. [This included  female lords.] (King Athelstan)    \"And every man shall see that he has a surety, and this surety  shall bring and keep him to [the performance of] every lawful  duty.    1.  And if anyone does wrong and escapes, his surety shall incur      what the other should have incurred.    2.  If the case be that of a thief and his surety can lay hold of      him within twelve months, he shall deliver him up to justice,      and what he has paid shall be returned to him.\" (King Edgar)    Every freeman who holds land, except lords with considerable  landed property, must be in a local tithing, usually ten to twelve  men, in which they serve as personal sureties for each other's  peaceful behavior. If one of the ten landholders in a tithing is  accused of an offense, the others have to produce him in court or  pay a fine plus pay the injured party for the offense, unless they  could prove that they had no complicity in it. If the man is found  guilty but can not pay, his tithing must pay his fine. The chief  officer is the \"tithing man\" or \"capital pledge\". There were  probably ten tithings in a hundred. (King Edward the Confessor).    Everyone was to take an oath not to steal, which one's surety  would compel one to keep.    No one may receive another lord's man without the permission of  this lord and only if the man is blameless towards every hand. The  penalty is the bot for disobedience. No lord was to dismiss any of  his men who had been accused, until he had made compensation and  done right.    \"No woman or maiden shall be forced to marry a man she dislikes or  given for money.\"    \"Violence to a widow or maiden is punishable by payment of one's  wergeld.\"    No man may have more wives than one.    No man may marry among his own kin within six degrees of  relationship or with the widow of a man as nearly related to him  as that, or with a near relative of his first wife's, or his god-  mother, or a divorced woman. Incest is punishable by payment of  one's wergeld or a fine or forfeiture of all his possessions.    Grounds for divorce were mutual consent or adultery or desertion.  Adultery was prohibited for men as well as for women. The penalty  was payment of a bot or denial of burial in consecrated ground. A  law of Canute provided that if a wife was guilty of adultery, she  forfeited all her property to her husband and her nose and ears,  but this law did not survive him.    Laymen may marry a second time, and a young widow may again take a  husband, but they will not receive a blessing and must do penance  for their incontinence.    Prostitutes were to be driven out of the land or destroyed in the  land, unless they cease from their wickedness and make amends to  the utmost of their ability.    Neither husband nor wife could sell family property without the  other's consent.    If there was a marriage agreement, it determined the wife's  \"dower\", which would be hers upon his death. Otherwise, if a man  who held his land in socage [owned it freely and not subject to a  larger landholder] died before his wife, she got half this  property. If there were minor children, she received all this  property.    Inheritance of land to adult children was by the custom of the  land held. In some places, the custom was for the oldest son to  take it and in other places, the custom was for the youngest son  to take it. Usually, the sons"]]]
