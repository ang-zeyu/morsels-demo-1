I  shall at once place you in durance, and shall send report to the  king of your mutinous conduct.\"    \"Be that as it may,\" another voice replied; \"whatever befall me, I  tell you, sir, that Thomas Hawkins will take no part in an act of  such foul and dastardly treachery. I am a soldier of King Edward.  I am paid to draw my sword against his enemies, and not to do the  bloody work of a murderer.\"    \"Seize him!\" the governor shouted. \"Give him in charge to the guard,  to lay in the castle dungeon.\"    There was a movement of feet now heard, but Cluny waited no  longer. The angry utterances had reached his ear, and knowing that  his mission was accomplished he thought only now of escape before  detection might take place. He had noticed when he entered the room  that the windows were, as was usually the case with rooms on the  lower floors, barred; but he saw also that the bars were wide enough  apart for a lad of his slimness to crawl through. The banqueting  room was raised three steps above the hall, and the room that he  was in was upon the same level; the window was four feet from the  floor, and would therefore be probably seven or eight above the  ground without, which would account for its not being more closely  barred. He speedily climbed up to it and thrust himself through the  bars, but not without immense difficulty and great destruction to  his feminine garments.    \"Poor Janet!\" Cluny laughed to himself as he dropped from the  window to the ground. \"Whatever would she say were she to see the  state of her kirtle and petticoats!\"    The moon was young, but the light was sufficient to enable Cluny  to see where he was. The window opened into a lane which ran down  by the side of the governor's house, and he was soon in the principal  street. Already most of the citizens were within their houses. A  few, provided with lanterns, were picking their way along the uneven  pavement.  Cluny knew that it was impossible for him to leave the  town that night; he would have given anything for a rope by which  he might lower himself from the walls, but there was no possibility  of his obtaining one. The appearance of a young girl wandering in  the streets alone at night would at once have attracted attention  and remarks. So Cluny withdrew into a dark archway, and then sat  down until the general silence told him that all had retired to  rest. Then he made his way along the street until he neared the  gateway, and there lying down by the wall he went to sleep.    When the gate was opened in the morning Cluny waited until a few  persons had passed in and out and then approached it.  \"Hallo! lass,\"  the sergeant of the guard, who was standing there, said. \"You are  a pretty figure with your torn clothes!  Why, what has happened to  you?\"    \"If you please, sir,\" Cluny said timidly, \"I was selling my eggs  to the governor's cook, and he kept me waiting, and I did not know  that it was so late, and when I got to the gates they were shut,  and I had nowhere to go; and then, please sir, as I was wandering  about a rough soldier seized me and wanted to kiss me, and of  course I would not let him, and in the struggle he tore my clothes  dreadfully; and some burghers, who heard me scream, came up and the  man left me, and one of the burghers let me sleep in his kitchen,  and I don't know what mother will say to my clothes;\" and Cluny  lifted the hem of his petticoat to his eyes.    \"It is a shame, lass,\" the sergeant said good temperedly; \"an I  had been there I would have broke the fellow's sconce for him; but  another time, lass, you should not overstay the hour; it is not good  for young girls to be roaming at night in a town full of soldiers.  There, I hope your mother won't beat you, for, after all, it was  the fault of the governor's cook rather than yours.\"    Cluny pursued his way with a quiet and depressed mien until he was  fairly out of sight of the gates. Then he lifted his petticoats to  a height which would have shocked his sister Janet, to give free  play to his limbs, and at the top of his speed dashed down the road  toward Lanark. He found his two companions waiting at the appointed  spot, but he did not pause a moment.    \"Are you mad, Cluny?\" they shouted.    And indeed the wild figure, with its tucked up garments, tearing  at full speed along the road, would have been deemed that of a mad  girl by any who had met it.    \"Come on!\" he shouted. \"Come on, it is for life or death!\" and  without further word he kept on at full speed.  It was some time  before his companions overtook him, for they were at first too  convulsed by laughter at Cluny's extraordinary appearance to be able  to run. But presently, sobered by the conviction that something of  extreme importance must have happened, they too started at their  best speed, and presently came up with Cluny, upon whose pace the  mile he had already run told heavily.    \"For the sake of goodness, Cluny, go slower,\" one of them panted  out as they came to him. \"We have nine miles yet to run, and if we  go on like this we shall break down in another half mile, and have  to walk the rest.\"    Cluny himself, with all his anxiety to get on, was beginning to  feel the same, and he slackened his pace to a slinging trot, which  in little over an hour brought them to the wood.          Chapter VI    The Barns of Ayr      Archie was anxiously awaiting the arrival of his messenger, for the  three lads were met two miles out by another who had been placed on  watch, and had come on ahead at full speed with the news of their  approach.  The report brought in by Jock Farrell of the words that  he had overheard in the barn prepared for the meeting, had been  reported by Archie to Wallace. Sir John Grahame and the other  gentlemen with him all agreed that they were strange, and his friends  had strongly urged their leader not to proceed to the meeting.  Wallace, however, persisted in his resolution to do so, unless  he received stronger proofs than those afforded by the few words  dropped by the governor and his officer, which might really have  no evil meaning whatever. He could not throw doubt upon the fair  intentions of King Edward's representative, for it might well be  said that it was the grossest insult to the English to judge them  as guilty of the intention of a foul act of treachery upon such  slight foundation as this. \"It would be a shame indeed,\" he said,  \"were I, the Warden of Scotland, to shrink from appearing at  a council upon such excuse as this.\" The utmost that Archie could  obtain from him was that he would delay his departure in the morning  until the latest moment, in order to see if any further news came  from Ayr.    The meeting was to be held at ten o'clock, and until a little before  nine he would not set out. He was in the act of mounting his horse  when Cluny Campbell arrived.    \"What are your news, Cluny?\" Archie exclaimed, as the lads, panting  and exhausted, ran up.    \"There is treachery intended. I overheard the governor say so.\"    \"Come along with me,\" Archie exclaimed; \"you are just in time,  and shall yourself tell the news. Draw your bridle, Sir William,\"  he exclaimed as he ran up to the spot where Sir William Wallace,  Grahame, and several other gentlemen were in the act of mounting.  \"Treachery is intended--my messenger has overheard it. I know  not his tale, but question him yourself.\"    Important as was the occasion, the Scottish chiefs could not resist  a smile at the wild appearance of Archie's messenger.    \"Is it a boy or a girl?\" Wallace asked Archie, \"for it might be  either.\"    \"He is one of my band, sir. I sent him dressed in this disguise as  it would be the least suspected. Now, Cluny, tell your own story.\"    Cluny told his story briefly, but giving word for word the sentences  that he had heard spoken in anger by the governor and his officer.    \"I fear there can be no doubt,\" Wallace said gravely when the  lad had finished--\"that foul play of some kind is intended, and  that it would be madness to trust ourselves in the hands of this  treacherous governor.  Would that we had had the news twenty-four  hours earlier; but even now some may be saved. Sir John, will you  gallop, with all your mounted men, at full speed towards Ayr. Send  men on all the roads leading to the council, and warn any who may  not yet have arrived against entering.\"    Sir John Grahame instantly gave orders to all those who had horses,  to mount and follow him at the top of their speed; and he himself,  with the other gentlemen whose horses were prepared, started at  once at full gallop.    \"Sir Archie, do you cause the 'assembly' to be sounded, and send  off your runners in all directions to bid every man who can be  collected to gather here this afternoon at three o clock. If foul  play has been done we can avenge, although we are too late to save,  and, by Heavens, a full and bloody revenge will I take.\"    It was not until two in the afternoon that Sir John Grahame returned.    \"The worst has happened; I can read it in your face,\" Wallace  exclaimed.    \"It is but too true,\" Sir John replied. \"For a time we could obtain  no information. One of my men rode forward until close to the Barns,  and reported that all seemed quiet there. A guard of soldiers were  standing round the gates, and he saw one of those invited, who had  arrived a minute before him, dismount and enter quietly. Fortunately  I was in time to stop many gentlemen who were proceeding to the  council, but more had entered before I reached there. From time  to time I sent forward men on foot who talked with those who were  standing without to watch the arrivals. Presently a terrible rumour  began to spread among them--whether the truth was known from some  coarse jest by one of the soldiers, or how it came out, I know not.
