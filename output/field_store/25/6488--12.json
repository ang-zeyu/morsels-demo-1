Miss Peasmarsh was very willing, for now her  stall, that had been SO neglected, was surrounded by people who wanted  to buy, and she was glad to be helped. The children noted that Mrs  Biddle had not more to do in the way of selling than she could manage  quite well. I hope they were not glad--for you should forgive your  enemies, even if they walk on your hands and then say it is all your  naughty fault. But I am afraid they were not so sorry as they ought to  have been.    It took some time to arrange the things on the stall. The carpet was  spread over it, and the dark colours showed up the brass and silver and  ivory things. It was a happy and busy afternoon, and when Miss Peasmarsh  and the girls had sold every single one of the little pretty things from  the Indian bazaar, far, far away, Anthea and Jane went off with the  boys to fish in the fishpond, and dive into the bran-pie, and hear the  cardboard band, and the phonograph, and the chorus of singing birds that  was done behind a screen with glass tubes and glasses of water.    They had a beautiful tea, suddenly presented to them by the nice curate,  and Miss Peasmarsh joined them before they had had more than three cakes  each. It was a merry party, and the curate was extremely pleasant to  every one, 'even to Miss Peasmarsh,' as Jane said afterwards.    'We ought to get back to the stall,' said Anthea, when no one could  possibly eat any more, and the curate was talking in a low voice to Miss  Peas marsh about 'after Easter'.    'There's nothing to go back for,' said Miss Peasmarsh gaily; 'thanks to  you dear children we've sold everything.'    'There--there's the carpet,' said Cyril.    'Oh,' said Miss Peasmarsh, radiantly, 'don't bother about the carpet.  I've sold even that. Mrs Biddle gave me ten shillings for it. She said  it would do for her servant's bedroom.'    'Why,' said Jane, 'her servants don't HAVE carpets. We had cook from  her, and she told us so.'    'No scandal about Queen Elizabeth, if YOU please,' said the curate,  cheerfully; and Miss Peasmarsh laughed, and looked at him as though she  had never dreamed that any one COULD be so amusing. But the others were  struck dumb. How could they say, 'The carpet is ours!' For who brings  carpets to bazaars?    The children were now thoroughly wretched. But I am glad to say that  their wretchedness did not make them forget their manners, as it does  sometimes, even with grown-up people, who ought to know ever so much  better.    They said, 'Thank you very much for the jolly tea,' and 'Thanks for  being so jolly,' and 'Thanks awfully for giving us such a jolly time;'  for the curate had stood fish-ponds, and bran-pies, and phonographs, and  the chorus of singing birds, and had stood them like a man. The girls  hugged Miss Peasmarsh, and as they went away they heard the curate say--    'Jolly little kids, yes, but what about--you will let it be directly  after Easter. Ah, do say you will--'    And Jane ran back and said, before Anthea could drag her away, 'What are  you going to do after Easter?'    Miss Peasmarsh smiled and looked very pretty indeed. And the curate  said--    'I hope I am going to take a trip to the Fortunate Islands.'    'I wish we could take you on the wishing carpet,' said Jane.    'Thank you,' said the curate, 'but I'm afraid I can't wait for that. I  must go to the Fortunate Islands before they make me a bishop. I should  have no time afterwards.'    'I've always thought I should marry a bishop,' said Jane: 'his aprons  would come in so useful. Wouldn't YOU like to marry a bishop, Miss  Peasmarsh?'    It was then that they dragged her away.    As it was Robert's hand that Mrs Biddle had walked on, it was decided  that he had better not recall the incident to her mind, and so make  her angry again. Anthea and Jane had helped to sell things at the rival  stall, so they were not likely to be popular.    A hasty council of four decided that Mrs Biddle would hate Cyril less  than she would hate the others, so the others mingled with the crowd,  and it was he who said to her--    'Mrs Biddle, WE meant to have that carpet. Would you sell it to us? We  would give you--'    'Certainly not,' said Mrs Biddle. 'Go away, little boy.'    There was that in her tone which showed Cyril, all too plainly, the  hopelessness of persuasion. He found the others and said--    'It's no use; she's like a lioness robbed of its puppies. We must watch  where it goes--and--Anthea, I don't care what you say. It's our own  carpet. It wouldn't be burglary. It would be a sort of forlorn hope  rescue party--heroic and daring and dashing, and not wrong at all.'    The children still wandered among the gay crowd--but there was no  pleasure there for them any more. The chorus of singing birds sounded  just like glass tubes being blown through water, and the phonograph  simply made a horrid noise, so that you could hardly hear yourself  speak. And the people were buying things they couldn't possibly want,  and it all seemed very stupid. And Mrs Biddle had bought the wishing  carpet for ten shillings. And the whole of life was sad and grey and  dusty, and smelt of slight gas escapes, and hot people, and cake and  crumbs, and all the children were very tired indeed.    They found a corner within sight of the carpet, and there they waited  miserably, till it was far beyond their proper bedtime. And when it was  ten the people who had bought things went away, but the people who had  been selling stayed to count up their money.    'And to jaw about it,' said Robert. 'I'll never go to another bazaar as  long as ever I live. My hand is swollen as big as a pudding. I expect  the nails in her horrible boots were poisoned.'    Just then some one who seemed to have a right to interfere said--    'Everything is over now; you had better go home.'    So they went. And then they waited on the pavement under the gas lamp,  where ragged children had been standing all the evening to listen to  the band, and their feet slipped about in the greasy mud till Mrs Biddle  came out and was driven away in a cab with the many things she hadn't  sold, and the few things she had bought--among others the carpet. The  other stall-holders left their things at the school till Monday morning,  but Mrs Biddle was afraid some one would steal some of them, so she took  them in a cab.    The children, now too desperate to care for mud or appearances, hung  on behind the cab till it reached Mrs Biddle's house. When she and the  carpet had gone in and the door was shut Anthea said--    'Don't let's burgle--I mean do daring and dashing rescue acts--till  we've given her a chance. Let's ring and ask to see her.'    The others hated to do this, but at last they agreed, on condition that  Anthea would not make any silly fuss about the burglary afterwards, if  it really had to come to that.    So they knocked and rang, and a scared-looking parlourmaid opened the  front door. While they were asking for Mrs Biddle they saw her. She was  in the dining-room, and she had already pushed back the table and spread  out the carpet to see how it looked on the floor.    'I knew she didn't want it for her servants' bedroom,' Jane muttered.    Anthea walked straight past the uncomfortable parlourmaid, and the  others followed her. Mrs Biddle had her back to them, and was smoothing  down the carpet with the same boot that had trampled on the hand  of Robert. So that they were all in the room, and Cyril, with great  presence of mind, had shut the room door before she saw them.    'Who is it, Jane?' she asked in a sour voice; and then turning suddenly,  she saw who it was. Once more her face grew violet--a deep, dark violet.  'You wicked daring little things!' she cried, 'how dare you come here?  At this time of night, too. Be off, or I'll send for the police.'    'Don't be angry,' said Anthea, soothingly, 'we only wanted to ask you  to let us have the carpet. We have quite twelve shillings between us,  and--'    'How DARE you?' cried Mrs Biddle, and her voice shook with angriness.    'You do look horrid,' said Jane suddenly.    Mrs Biddle actually stamped that booted foot of hers. 'You rude,  barefaced child!' she said.    Anthea almost shook Jane; but Jane pushed forward in spite of her.    'It really IS our nursery carpet,' she said, 'you ask ANY ONE if it  isn't.'    'Let's wish ourselves home,' said Cyril in a whisper.    'No go,' Robert whispered back, 'she'd be there too, and raving mad as  likely as not. Horrid thing, I hate her!'    'I wish Mrs Biddle was in an angelic good temper,' cried Anthea,  suddenly. 'It's worth trying,' she said to herself.    Mrs Biddle's face grew from purple to violet, and from violet to mauve,  and from mauve to pink. Then she smiled quite a jolly smile.    'Why, so I am!' she said, 'what a funny idea! Why shouldn't I be in a  good temper, my dears.'    Once more the carpet had done its work, and not on Mrs Biddle alone. The  children felt suddenly good and happy.    'You're a jolly good sort,' said Cyril. 'I see that now. I'm sorry we  vexed you at the bazaar to-day.'    'Not another word,' said the changed Mrs Biddle. 'Of course you shall  have the carpet, my dears, if you've taken such a fancy to it. No, no; I  won't have more than the ten shillings I paid.'    'It does seem hard to ask you for it after you bought it at the bazaar,'  said Anthea; 'but it really IS our nursery carpet. It got to the bazaar  by mistake, with some other things.'    'Did it really, now? How vexing!' said Mrs Biddle, kindly. 'Well, my  dears, I can very well give the extra ten shillings; so you take your  carpet and we'll say no more about it. Have a piece of cake before you  go! I'm so sorry I stepped on your hand, my boy. Is it all right now?'    'Yes, thank you,' said Robert. 'I say, you ARE good.'    'Not at all,' said Mrs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8390"],[0,"Buddhism and Buddhists in China (#13)"],[1," important government official obliged to deal with many vexatious  requests and demands declared: \"I could not get through my day's work,  if I did not spend an hour every day in meditation, just as Buddha did  when he became enlightened.\" He was asked what he did when he meditated  or prayed. \"Nothing at all.\" \"Well, about what do you think?\" \"Of  nothing at all. I stop thinking when I engage in religious meditation.  Life makes me think too much. I should lose my sanity, if I did not stop  thinking and enter into the 'void', whence we all came and into which we  all are going to drop back.\"    His Christian inquirer still was unsatisfied by the Buddhist's  description of his prayer life, and pressed further for details. \"What  happens when you meditate or pray?\"    \"Nothing happens, I tell you, except, that I experience a peace which  the passing world cannot give and which the passing world cannot  altogether take away. The secret of religion is simply to realize that  everything is passing away. When you accept that fact, then you become  really free. The Christian world seemed to have been tremendously  impressed by the slogan of the French soldiers at Verdun, 'They shall  not pass!' Perhaps the German soldiers did not pass just then or there.  But the French soldiers themselves are all passing away. And everything  in the world is passing away. What our Buddhist religion teaches us is:  'Let it pass!' You cannot keep anything for very long. And prayer or  meditation is simply to practice yourself in that thought deliberately.  Oh, it is a wonderful peace when you fully believe that gospel, and  enter into it every day. Vanity of vanities, everything is vanity! Why  worry? We do altogether too much worrying. To pray means simply to quit  worrying, to quit thinking, to enter into the indescribably passionless  peace of Nirvana.\"    Here seemed to be an ardent Buddhist. When asked what he thought as the  difference between a Buddhist and a Christian, he answered promptly:    \"Yes, there is my wife. She is a very good woman. All the neighbors come  to her, when there is any one sick or in trouble. So I say to her:  'Wife, I should think you would make a first-class Christian.' But I  think she lets herself be worried by altogether too many troubles. She  is all the time thinking and fussing and planning. To be sure, it is  mostly about other people, But then she does have the children and the  house and the relatives and friends and neighbors to look after. Perhaps  she really cannot be a Buddhist. Perhaps it is all a matter of  temperament. Oh, but I tell you it is great to be a Buddhist, because it  gives you such a wonderful peace.\"          IX      PRESENT-DAY BUDDHISM:    _1. Periods of Buddhist History_    The history of Buddhism in China may be divided into four periods.  Buddhism entered China, as we have seen, in the second century B.C. The  first period, that of the translation and propagation of the faith,  ended in 420 A.D. The second period, that of interpenetration, lasted to  the beginning of the T'ang dynasty, 618 A.D. The third, the period of  establishment, ended with the close of the five dynasties, in 960 A.D.  The fourth period, that of decay, has extended to the present day.    _2. The Progress of the Last Twenty-five Years_    There are signs of a revival of Buddhism in China. Whether this is a  tide, or a wave, only the future can reveal. In 1893 Dharmapala, an  Indian monk, stopped in Shanghai on his way back from the Congress of  Religions in Chicago. It was his purpose to make a tour of China, to  arouse the Chinese Buddhists to send missionaries to India to restore  Buddhism there, and then to start a propaganda throughout the whole  world. He addressed the monks of Shanghai. Dr. Edkins, the veteran  missionary, acted as his interpreter. Dharmapala was surrounded by a  horde of curious monks who were more interested in his strange  appearance and in the cost of his garments than they were in his great  ideals. They were also feeling the iron heel of the Confucian government  and at once inquired about the attitude of the government toward such an  innovation. Dharmapala did not go beyond Shanghai.    Japanese Buddhists, especially the members of the Hongwanji sect, have  taken a deep interest in Chinese Buddhists. Count Otani once visited the  chief monasteries of China. Numerous Japanese Buddhists have made such  visits. In 1902, the Empress Dowager, fired by a reforming zeal, decided  to confiscate Buddhist property and to use the proceeds for the spread  of modern education. The Buddhist monasteries put themselves under the  protection of Japanese monks in order to hold their property. When by  1906 the Empress Dowager saw the consequences of her edict, she at once  issued a new edict, reversing the former one, and the Japanese monks  took their departure.    The Japanese Buddhists have been fired by missionary zeal for China. In  many of the large cities of China are the temples of the Hongwanji sect.  Established primarily for the Japanese, these temples are intended to  serve as points of departure for a nation-wide missionary work. The  twenty-one demands made upon China included two significant items in the  last group which the Chinese refused to sign: \"Art. 2: Japanese  hospitals, churches and schools in the interior of China shall be  granted the right of owning land.\" \"Art. 7: China agrees that Japanese  subjects shall have the right of missionary propaganda in China.\"    Under Japanese influence there was established in 1907 at Nanking, under  the leadership of Yang, a lay Buddhist devotee, a school for the  training of Buddhist missionaries. The students were to go to Japan for  further training, and the more promising ones were to study in India.  This project was discontinued after the death of Yang on account of the  lack of funds.    When the republic was established Buddhism felt a wave of reform. The  monasteries established schools for monks and children. A magazine was  published which appeared irregularly for several numbers and then  stopped. A national organization was formed with headquarters at Peking.  A survey of monasteries was begun. The activities in lecturing and  propaganda were increased, but Yuan Shih-kai issued twenty-seven  regulations for the control of Buddhist monasteries, which markedly  dampened the ardor of the reformers.    The world war which accentuated the spirit of nationalism had the added  effect of stirring up Buddhist enthusiasm. There are at present signs of  new activity among them in China.    _3. Present Activities_    While Buddhism may be standing still or even dying in certain parts of  China, it is showing signs of new life in the provinces of Kiangsu and  Chekiang and in the large cities. Such revival in centers subject to the  influence of the modern world shows that Buddhism in China as in Japan  has sufficient vitality to adjust itself to modern conditions. Let us  consider some of these activities.    _(a) The Reconstruction of Monasteries._--During the T'ai Ping  rebellion, which devastated China in 1850-1865, the monasteries suffered  with the towns. Not only were the monasteries burned to the ground, but  their means of support were taken away and the monks were scattered.  There are still many of these ruined monasteries in the Yangtze valley  and in southern and western China. Quite a number of them have been  rebuilt. Perhaps the most notable example is that at Changchow which was  destroyed during the rebellion. Today it is the largest monastery in  China, having about two thousand monks. In Fukien several new  monasteries have been built in the last few decades. In the provinces of  Chekiang and Kiangsu, in the large cities and about Peking there are  building activities, showing that the monasteries are feeling a new wave  of prosperity.    T'ai Hsu, one of the leaders' of modern Buddhism, is holding up an ideal  program for Buddhism in this time of reconstruction. He proposes that  there should be 576 central monasteries, 4608 preaching places, 72  Buddhist hospitals and 72 orphanages.    _(b) Accessions._--Regarding the number of monks it is almost  impossible to obtain any reliable figures. A conservative estimate,  based upon partial returns, makes the number of monks about 400,000 and  that of nuns about 10,000. The impression among the Buddhists is that  the number of monks is increasing. That is quite probable in view of the  rebuilding and repairing which is now in progress.    More significant is the number of accessions from the learned class.  Many officials, disheartened by the present confused political  situation, have sought refuge in the monasteries. Some of them are now  abbots of monasteries and are using their influence to build them up.  All over China there are Confucian scholars who are giving themselves to  the study of Buddhism and to meditation. Some of the Chinese students  who have studied in Buddhist universities in Japan are propagating  Buddhism by lecture and pen.    _(c) Publications._--Quite as significant is the increase in the  publication of Buddhist literature of all kinds. Many of the monasteries  have printing departments where they publish the sutras needed for their  own use. In addition, there are eight or more publishing centers where  Buddhist literature is printed. The most famous are Yang's establishment  at Nanking, the Buddhist Press in Yangchow and that in Peking. In these  establishments about nine hundred different works are being published.  The most noteworthy recent publication has been that of the Chinese  Buddhist Tripitaka in Shanghai.    Among these publications are a few modern issues. The Chung Hua Book  Company has published several works on Buddhism. Other books have been  issued for the sake of harmonizing Buddhism with western science and  philosophy. In this enterprise Japanese influence is visible. In 1921 a  Shanghai press published a"]]]
