[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7234"],[0,"Species and Varieties, Their Origin (#13)"],[1," such diversity. Some include a few types  only, while [82] others show, a large number of forms clearly separated  to a greater or lesser degree.    In some few instances it is obvious that this variability is of later  date than culture. The most conspicuous case is that of the coconut.  This valuable palm is found on nearly all tropical coasts, in America,  as well as in Asia, but in Africa and Australia there are many hundreds  of miles of shore line, where it is not found. Its importance is not at  all the same everywhere. On the shores and islands of the Indian Ocean  and the Malay Archipelago, man is chiefly dependent upon it, but in  America it is only of subordinate usefulness.    In connection with these facts, it abounds in subspecies and varieties  in the East Indian regions, but on the continent of America little  attention has as yet been given to its diverging qualities. In the  Malayan region it affords nearly all that is required by the  inhabitants. The value of its fruit as food, and the delicious beverage  which it yields, are well known. The fibrous rind is not less useful; it  is manufactured into a kind of cordage, mats and floor-cloths. An  excellent oil is obtained from the kernel by compression. The hard  covering of the stem is converted into drums and used in the  construction of huts; the lower part is so hard as to take on a  beautiful polish [83] when it resembles agate. Finally the unexpanded  terminal bud is a delicate article of food. Many other uses could be  mentioned, but these may suffice to indicate how closely the life of the  inhabitants is bound up with the culture of this palm, and how sharply,  in consequence, its qualities must have been watched by early man. Any  divergence from the ordinary type must have been noted; those which were  injurious must have been rejected, but the useful ones must have been  appreciated and propagated. In a word any degree of variability afforded  by nature must have been noticed and cultivated.    More than fifty different sorts of the coconut are described from the  Indian shores and islands, with distinct local and botanical names.  Miquel, who was one of the best systematists of tropical plants, of the  last century, described a large number of them, and since, more have  been added. Nearly all useful qualities vary in a higher or lesser  degree in the different varieties. The fibrous strands of the rind of  the nut are developed in some forms to such a length and strength as to  yield the industrial product known as the coir-fibre. Only three of them  are mentioned by Miquel that have this quality, the _Cocos nucifera  rutila_, _cupuliformis_ and _stupposa_. Among them the _rutila_ [84]  yields the best and most supple fibres, while those of the _stupposa_  are stiff and almost unbending.    The varieties also differ greatly in size, color, shape and quality, and  the trees have also peculiar characteristics. One variety exhibits  leaves which are nearly entire, the divisions being only imperfectly  separated, as often occurs in the very first leaves of the seedlings of  other varieties. The flavor of the flesh, oil and milk likewise yield  many good varietal marks.    In short, the coconut-palm comes under the general rule, that botanical  species are built up of a number of sharply distinguishable types, which  prove their constancy and relative independence by their wide  distribution in culture. In systematic works all these forms are called  varieties, and a closer investigation of their real systematic value has  not yet been made. But the question as to the origin of the varieties  and of the coconut itself has engrossed the attention of many botanists,  among whom are De Candolle in the middle of the last century, and Cook  at its close.    Both questions are closely connected. De Candolle claimed an Asiatic  origin for the whole species, while Cook's studies go to prove that its  original habitat is to be sought in the northern countries of South  America. Numerous [85] varieties are growing in Asia and have as yet not  been observed to occur in America, where the coconut is only of  subordinate importance, being one of many useful plants, and not the  only one relied upon by the natives for their subsistence. If therefore,  De Candolle's opinion is the right one, the question as to whether the  varieties are older or younger than the cultivated forms of the species,  must always remain obscure. But if the proofs of an American origin  should be forthcoming, the possibility, and even the probability that  the varieties are of later date than the beginning of their culture, and  have originated while in this condition must at once be granted. An  important point in the controversy is the manner in which the coconuts  were disseminated from shore to shore, from island to island. De  Candolle, Darwin and most of the European writers claim that the  dispersal was by natural agencies, such as ocean-currents. They point  out that the fibrous rind or husk would keep the fruits afloat, and  uninjured, for many days or even many weeks, while being carried from  one country to another in a manner that would explain their geographic  distribution. But the probability of the nuts being thrown upon the  strand, and far enough from the shore to find suitable conditions for  their germination, is a very small one. To insure [86] healthy and  vigorous seedlings the nuts must be fully ripe, after which planting  cannot be safely delayed for more than a few weeks. If kept too moist  the nuts rot. If once on the shore, and allowed to lie in the sun, they  become overheated and are thereby destroyed; if thrown in the shade of  other shrubs and trees, the seedlings do not find the required  conditions for a vigorous growth.    Some authors have taken the fibrous rind to be especially adapted to  transport by sea, but if this were so, this would argue that water is  the normal or at least the very frequent medium of dissemination, which  of course it is not. We may, claim with quite as much right that the  thick husk is necessary to enable the heavy fruit to drop from tall  trees with safety. But even for this purpose the protection is not  sufficient, as the nuts often suffer from falling to such a degree as to  be badly injured as to their germinating qualities. It is well known  that nuts, which are destined for propagation, are as a rule not allowed  to fall off, but are taken from the trees with great care.    Summing up his arguments, Cook concludes that there is little in the way  of known facts to support the poetic theory of the coconut palm dropping  its fruits into the sea to float away to barren islands and prepare them  for [87] human habitation. Shipwrecks might furnish a successful method  of launching viable coconuts, and such have no doubt sometimes  contributed to their distribution. But this assumption implies a  dissemination of the nuts by man, and if this principal fact is granted,  it is far more natural to believe in a conscious intelligent  dissemination.    The coconut is a cultivated tree. It may be met with in some spots  distant from human dwellings, but whenever such cases have been  subjected to a closer scrutiny, it appears that evidently, or at least  probably, huts had formerly existed in their neighborhood, but having  been destroyed by some accident, had left the palm trees uninjured. Even  in South America, where it may be found in forests at great distances  from the sea-shore, it is not at all certain that true native localities  occur, and it seems to be quite lost in its natural condition.    Granting the cultivated state of the palms as the only really important  one, and considering the impossibility or at least great improbability  of its dissemination by natural means, the distribution by man himself,  according to his wants, assumes the rank of an hypothesis fully adequate  to the explanation of all the facts concerning the life-history of the  tree.    We now have to inquire into the main question, [88] whether it is  probable that the coconut is of American or of Asiatic origin, leaving  aside the historic evidence which goes to prove that nothing is known  about the period in which its dissemination from one hemisphere to  another took place, we will now consider only the botanic and geographic  evidence, brought forward by Cook. He states that the whole family of  coconut-palms, consisting of about 20 genera and 200 species, are all  strictly American with the exception of the rather aberrant African  oilpalm, which has, however, an American relative referred to the same  genus. The coconut is the sole representative of this group which is  connected with Asia and the Malayan region, but there is no manifest  reason why other members of the same group could not have established  themselves there, and maintained an existence under conditions, which  are not at all unfavorable to them. The only obvious reason is the  assumption already made, that the distribution was brought about by man,  and thus only affected the species, chosen by him for cultivation. That  the coconut cannot have been imported from Asia into America seems to be  the most obvious conclusion from the arguments given. It should be  briefly noted, that it was known and widely distributed in tropical  America at the time of the discovery of that continent [89] by Columbus,  according to accounts of Oviedo and other contemporary Spanish writers.    Concluding we may state that according to the whole evidence as it has  been discussed by De Candolle and especially by Cook, the coconut-palm  is of American origin and has been distributed as a cultivated tree by  man through the whole of its wide range. This must have happened in a  prehistoric era, thus affording time enough for the subsequent  development of the fifty and more known varieties. But the possibility  that at least some of them have originated before culture and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7238"],[0,"My Four Years in Germany (#13)"],[1,"and the  Annexationists were hot for war. The people alive could recall  only three wars, the war against Denmark in 1864, which was settled  in a few days and added the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein to  the Prussian crown, and the war of 1866 in which Bavaria, Baden,  Württemberg, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Saxony were defeated, when the  Austrian kingdom of Hanover disappeared and the territories of  Hesse-Cassel and Nassau, and the free city of Frankfort were  added to Prussia. This war, from its declaration to the battle  of Königgratz in which the Austrians were completely defeated,  lasted only two weeks. In 1870 France was defeated within a month  and a half after the opening of hostilities; so that the Kaiser  was implicitly believed when, on the first day of the war, he  appeared on the balcony of the palace and told the crowds who  were keen for war, that \"before the leaves have fallen from the  trees you will be back in your homes.\" The army and all Germany  believed him and believed, too, that a few short weeks would  see the destruction of France and the consequent seizure of her  rich colonies; that Russia could then be struck a good quick  blow before she could concentrate her army and resources; that  England would remain neutral; and that Germany would consequently  become, if not the actual owner, at least the dictator of the  world. Some one has since said that the Emperor must have meant  pine trees.    Working ever in the dark, either owning or influencing newspapers,  the great munition and arms factory of the Krupp's insidiously  poisoned the minds of the people with the microbe of war.    Prince Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador to London, called upon  me often after the outbreak of the war, and insisted that he  had correctly reported the sentiments of England in saying that  England did not want war. After his return to Germany the Germans  quite unfairly treated him as a man who had failed and seemed  to blame him because England had taken the only possible course  open to her and ranged herself on the side of France and Russia.    The dedication at Leipzig, in the year 1913, of the great monument  to celebrate what is called the \"War of Liberation,\" and the  victory of Leipzig in the War of the Nations, 1813, had undoubtedly  kindled a martial spirit in Germany. To my mind, the course which  really determined the Emperor and the ruling class for war was  the attitude of the whole people in the Zabern Affair and their  evident and growing dislike of militarism. The fact that the  Socialists, at the close of the session of the Reichstag, boldly  remained in the Chamber and refused to rise or to cheer the name  of the Emperor indicated a new spirit of resistance to autocracy;  and autocracy saw that if it was to keep its hold upon Germany  it must lead the nation into a short and successful war.    This is no new trick of a ruling and aristocratic class. From  the days when the patricians of Rome forced the people into war  whenever the people showed a disposition to demand their rights,  autocracies have always turned to war as the best antidote against  the spirit of democracy.          CHAPTER VI    AT KIEL JUST BEFORE THE WAR    Kiel, situated on the Baltic, on the eastern side of the peninsula  of Jutland near the Baltic entrance of the Kiel Canal, is the  principal naval centre of Germany.    When the Germans decided to build up a great fleet the Emperor  used every means to encourage a love of yachting and of the sea,  and endeavoured to make the Kiel Week a rival of the week at  Cowes, the English yachting centre.    With this end in view, the rich Germans were encouraged and almost  commanded to build and race yachts; and Americans and others who  visited Kiel in their yachts were entertained by the Emperor  in an intimacy impossible if they had come to Berlin merely as  tourists, residing in a hotel.    In June, 1914, we went to Kiel as guests of Allison Armour of  Chicago, on his yacht, the _Utowana_. I was detained by  business in Berlin and Mrs. Gerard preceded me to Kiel. I arrived  there on Saturday, the twenty-seventh of June, and that night  went with Armour to dine with the Emperor on board the Emperor's  yacht, _Hohenzollern_.    In the harbour were a fair number of German yachts, mostly sailing  yachts, taking part in the races; the fine old yacht of Lord  Brassey, _The Sunbeam_, and the yacht of the Prince of Monaco,  in which he conducts his scientific voyages. A great English  fleet, comprising some of the most powerful dreadnoughts, had  also arrived, sent as an earnest of the good will and kindly  feeling then supposed to exist between Great Britain and Germany.  The redoubtable von Tirpitz was present on a German battleship,  and the Hamburg American Line had an old transatlantic steamer,  the _Deutschland_, rechristened the _Victoria Luise_,  filled with guests, most of whom were invited on a hint from  the Emperor.    At dinner on the _Hohenzollern_ a number of English people  were present. The Kaiser had on one side of him the wife of the  British Admiral, Lady Maud Warrender, and on the other side, the  Countess of March, whose husband is heir to the Duke of Richmond.  I sat between Princess Münster and the Countess of March, and  after dinner the Emperor drew me over to the rail of the ship,  and talked to me for some time. I wish that diplomatic etiquette  would permit me to reveal what he said, but even in war time I  do not think I ought to violate the confidence that hospitality  seals. However important and interesting, especially to the tame  Socialists of Germany, I do not give this conversation with the  Emperor, nor the conversation with him and Colonel House at the  _Schrippenfest_, because I was his guest. Conversations  with the Emperor which I had on later occasions were at official  audiences and to these the same rule does not apply. He also  invited me to sail with him in his yacht, the _Meteor_, in  the races from Kiel to Eckernfjord on the coming Tuesday.    [Illustration: THE EMPEROR'S RACING YACHT, AND OTHERS, AT KIEL.]    [Illustration: THE \"HOHENZOLLERN\".]    Sunday afternoon Prince Henry and his wife, who reside in the  castle at Kiel, were to give an afternoon reception and garden  party; but on arriving at the gates we were told that the party  would not take place. After going on board the _Utowana_,  Frederick W. Wile, the celebrated correspondent of the  _London Daily Mail_, ranged up alongside in a small launch and  informed us that the Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the  Austrian throne, and his wife had been assassinated at Sarajevo.  There was much rushing to and fro in fast launches, the Emperor  himself being summoned from the race which was in progress. That  night we dined on board the yacht of the Prince of Monaco. All the  diplomats and notables whom I met during the afternoon and evening  seemed to think that there was no chance that the tragedy at  Sarajevo would lead to war. The next morning the Emperor left  early for Berlin, but expressly directed that the festivities  and races at Kiel should be carried out as arranged.    Monday afternoon there was a _Bierabend_ in the large hall  of the yacht club at Kiel. The Emperor was to have presided at  this dinner, but his place was taken by his brother, Prince Henry.  Sir Edward Goschen, the British Ambassador, who was living on one  of the British battleships, sat on his right and I sat on his  left. During the evening a curious incident happened. The Prince  and I were talking of the dangers of after-dinner speaking and what  a dangerous sport it was. In the midst of our conversation some  one whispered to the Prince and he rose to his feet, proposed the  health of the visiting British Admiral and fleet, and made a little  speech. As he concluded, he said, addressing the officers of the  British fleet: \"We are sorry you are going and we are sorry you  came.\" It is remarkable as showing the discipline of the German  nation and their respect for authority that thereafter no German  ever referred to this curious slip of the tongue. The night was  rather mild and after dinner we walked about the gardens of the  yacht club. I had a long and interesting conversation with the  Prince of Monaco. That Prince, who receives such a large income  from the company which carries on the gambling rooms at Monte  Carlo, is a man of the world intensely interested in scientific  research: there is practically no corner of the seven seas into  which his yacht has not poked her nose in the search for material  for the Sea Museum which he has established at Monaco.    On Tuesday Armour and I boarded the Emperor's sailing yacht,  the new _Meteor_. The race was a beautiful run from Kiel  to Eckernfjord and was won by the _Meteor_. As the Emperor  was not on board, I did not get one of the souvenir scarf-pins  always given to guests who sail with him on a winning race. Among  our crew was Grand Admiral von Köster, subsequently an advocate  of the ruthless submarine war.    Eckernfjord is a little fishing and bathing town. Near by is  the country residence of Prince Henry, a rather modest house,  built in brick in English Elizabethan style. The wife of Prince  Henry was a Princess of Hesse-Darmstadt and is the sister of the  Czarina of Russia. We had tea with Prince and Princess Henry,  their family, the Duke of Sonderburg-Glücksburg and several others  of his family. The billiard room of the house is decorated with  the large original caricatures made by McCutcheon of the Prince's  stay in America. Prince and Princess Henry came out to dine on  the _Utowana_, and Armour and the Prince went ashore to  attend another _Bierabend_, but I dodged the smoke and beer  and remained on board. Before he left the yacht, I had a talk  with Prince Henry. He seemed most exercised over the dislike of  the Germans by all other peoples and asked me why I thought it  existed. I politely told him "]]]
