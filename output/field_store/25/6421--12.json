We  saw it many times as the earth revolved, and some stars rose on the  clear horizon and others sank down to it: there were \"lights\" on every  quarter. Some we watched and followed until we saw the deception and  grew wiser; some were lights from those of our boats that were  fortunate enough to have lanterns, but these were generally easily  detected, as they rose and fell in the near distance. Once they raised  our hopes, only to sink them to zero again. Near what seemed to be the  horizon on the port quarter we saw two lights close together, and  thought this must be our double light; but as we gazed across the  miles that separated us, the lights slowly drew apart and we realized  that they were two boats' lanterns at different distances from us, in  line, one behind the other. They were probably the forward port boats  that had to return so many miles next morning across the Titanic's  graveyard.    But notwithstanding these hopes and disappointments, the absence of  lights, food and water (as we thought), and the bitter cold, it would  not be correct to say we were unhappy in those early morning hours:  the cold that settled down on us like a garment that wraps close  around was the only real discomfort, and that we could keep at bay by  not thinking too much about it as well as by vigorous friction and  gentle stamping on the floor (it made too much noise to stamp hard!).  I never heard that any one in boat B had any after effects from the  cold--even the stoker who was so thinly clad came through without  harm. After all, there were many things to be thankful for: so many  that they made insignificant the temporary inconvenience of the cold,  the crowded boat, the darkness and the hundred and one things that in  the ordinary way we might regard as unpleasant. The quiet sea, the  beautiful night (how different from two nights later when flashes of  lightning and peals of thunder broke the sleep of many on board the  Carpathia!), and above all the fact of being in a boat at all when so  many of our fellow-passengers and crew--whose cries no longer moaned  across the water to us--were silent in the water. Gratitude was the  dominant note in our feelings then. But grateful as we were, our  gratitude was soon to be increased a hundred fold. About 3:30 A.M., as  nearly as I can judge, some one in the bow called our attention to a  faint far-away gleam in the southeast. We all turned quickly to look  and there it was certainly: streaming up from behind the horizon like  a distant flash of a warship's searchlight; then a faint boom like  guns afar off, and the light died away again. The stoker who had lain  all night under the tiller sat up suddenly as if from a dream, the  overcoat hanging from his shoulders. I can see him now, staring out  across the sea, to where the sound had come from, and hear him shout,  \"That was a cannon!\" But it was not: it was the Carpathia's rocket,  though we did not know it until later. But we did know now that  something was not far away, racing up to our help and signalling to us  a preliminary message to cheer our hearts until she arrived.    With every sense alert, eyes gazing intently at the horizon and ears  open for the least sound, we waited in absolute silence in the quiet  night. And then, creeping over the edge of the sea where the flash had  been, we saw a single light, and presently a second below it, and in a  few minutes they were well above the horizon and they remained in  line! But we had been deceived before, and we waited a little longer  before we allowed ourselves to say we were safe. The lights came up  rapidly: so rapidly it seemed only a few minutes (though it must have  been longer) between first seeing them and finding them well above the  horizon and bearing down rapidly on us. We did not know what sort of a  vessel was coming, but we knew she was coming quickly, and we searched  for paper, rags,--anything that would burn (we were quite prepared to  burn our coats if necessary). A hasty paper torch was twisted out of  letters found in some one's pocket, lighted, and held aloft by the  stoker standing on the tiller platform. The little light shone in  flickers on the faces of the occupants of the boat, ran in broken  lines for a few yards along the black oily sea (where for the first  time I saw the presence of that awful thing which had caused the whole  terrible disaster--ice--in little chunks the size of one's fist,  bobbing harmlessly up and down), and spluttered away to blackness  again as the stoker threw the burning remnants of paper overboard. But  had we known it, the danger of being run down was already over, one  reason being that the Carpathia had already seen the lifeboat which  all night long had shown a green light, the first indication the  Carpathia had of our position. But the real reason is to be found in  the Carpathia's log:--\"Went full speed ahead during the night; stopped  at 4 A.M. with an iceberg dead ahead.\" It was a good reason.    With our torch burnt and in darkness again we saw the headlights stop,  and realized that the rescuer had hove to. A sigh of relief went up  when we thought no hurried scramble had to be made to get out of her  way, with a chance of just being missed by her, and having to meet the  wash of her screws as she tore by us. We waited and she slowly swung  round and revealed herself to us as a large steamer with all her  portholes alight. I think the way those lights came slowly into view  was one of the most wonderful things we shall ever see. It meant  deliverance at once: that was the amazing thing to us all. We had  thought of the afternoon as our time of rescue, and here only a few  hours after the Titanic sank, before it was yet light, we were to be  taken aboard. It seemed almost too good to be true, and I think  everyone's eyes filled with tears, men's as well as women's, as they  saw again the rows of lights one above the other shining kindly to  them across the water, and \"Thank God!\" was murmured in heartfelt  tones round the boat. The boat swung round and the crew began their  long row to the steamer; the captain called for a song and led off  with \"Pull for the shore, boys.\" The crew took it up quaveringly and  the passengers joined in, but I think one verse was all they sang. It  was too early yet, gratitude was too deep and sudden in its  overwhelming intensity, for us to sing very steadily. Presently,  finding the song had not gone very well, we tried a cheer, and that  went better. It was more easy to relieve our feelings with a noise,  and time and tune were not necessary ingredients in a cheer.    In the midst of our thankfulness for deliverance, one name was  mentioned with the deepest feeling of gratitude: that of Marconi. I  wish that he had been there to hear the chorus of gratitude that went  out to him for the wonderful invention that spared us many hours, and  perhaps many days, of wandering about the sea in hunger and storm and  cold. Perhaps our gratitude was sufficiently intense and vivid to  \"Marconi\" some of it to him that night.    All around we saw boats making for the Carpathia and heard their  shouts and cheers. Our crew rowed hard in friendly rivalry with other  boats to be among the first home, but we must have been eighth or  ninth at the side. We had a heavy load aboard, and had to row round a  huge iceberg on the way.    And then, as if to make everything complete for our happiness, came  the dawn. First a beautiful, quiet shimmer away in the east, then a  soft golden glow that crept up stealthily from behind the sky-line as  if it were trying not to be noticed as it stole over the sea and  spread itself quietly in every direction--so quietly, as if to make us  believe it had been there all the time and we had not observed it.  Then the sky turned faintly pink and in the distance the thinnest,  fleeciest clouds stretched in thin bands across the horizon and close  down to it, becoming every moment more and more pink. And next the  stars died, slowly,--save one which remained long after the others  just above the horizon; and near by, with the crescent turned to the  north, and the lower horn just touching the horizon, the thinnest,  palest of moons.    And with the dawn came a faint breeze from the west, the first breath  of wind we had felt since the Titanic stopped her engines.  Anticipating a few hours,--as the day drew on to 8 A.M., the time the  last boats came up,--this breeze increased to a fresh wind which  whipped up the sea, so that the last boat laden with people had an  anxious time in the choppy waves before they reached the Carpathia. An  officer remarked that one of the boats could not have stayed afloat  another hour: the wind had held off just long enough.    The captain shouted along our boat to the crew, as they strained at  the oars,--two pulling and an extra one facing them and pushing to try  to keep pace with the other boats,--\"A new moon! Turn your money over,  boys! That is, if you have any!\" We laughed at him for the quaint  superstition at such a time, and it was good to laugh again, but he  showed his disbelief in another superstition when he added, \"Well, I  shall never say again that 13 is an unlucky number. Boat 13 is the  best friend we ever had.\"    If there had been among us--and it is almost certain that there were,  so fast does superstition cling--those who feared events connected  with the number thirteen, I am certain they agreed with him, and never  again will they attach any importance to such a foolish belief.  Perhaps the belief itself will receive a shock when it is remembered  that boat 13 of the Titanic brought away a full load from the sinking  vessel, carried them in such comfort all night that they had not even  a drop of water on them, and landed them safely at the Carpathia's  side, where they climbed aboard without a single mishap. It almost  tempts one to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6677"],[0,"Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes and Sweetmeats, (#13)"],[1,"s, and pound  the spice. Then add the salt and pepper, and mix all the  ingredients well together. Beat slightly four eggs, and mix them  with the seasoning and bread crumbs.    After the turkey is drawn, take a sharp knife and, beginning at  the wings, carefully separate the flesh from the bone, scraping it  down as you go; and avoid tearing or breaking the skin. Next,  loosen the flesh from the breast and back, and then from the  thighs. It requires great care and patience to do it nicely. When  all the flesh is thus loosened, take the turkey by the neck, give  it a pull, and the skeleton will come out entire from the flesh,  as easily as you draw your hand out of a glove. The flesh will  then be a shapeless mass. With a needle and thread mend or sew up  any holes that may be found in the skin.    Take up a handful of the seasoning, squeeze it hard and proceed to  stuff the turkey with it, beginning at the wings, next to the  body, and then the thighs.    If you stuff it properly, it will again assume its natural shape.  Stuff it very hard. When all the stuffing is in, sew up the  breast, and skewer the turkey into its proper form, so that it  will look as if it had not been boned.    Tie it round with tape and bake it three hours or more. Make a  gravy of the giblets chopped, and enrich it with some wine and an  egg.    If the turkey is to be eaten cold, drop spoonfuls of red currant  jelly all over it, and in the dish round it.    A large fowl may be boned and stuffed in the same manner.      COLLARED PORK.      A leg of fresh pork, not large.    Two table-spoonfuls of powdered sage.    Two table-spoonfuls of sweet marjoram, \\ powdered.    One table-spoonful of sweet basil,     /    A quarter of an ounce of mace, \\    Half an ounce of cloves,        } powdered.    Two nutmegs,                   /    A bunch of pot-herbs, chopped small.    A sixpenny loaf of stale bread, grated.    Half a pound of butter, cut into the bread.    Two eggs.    A table-spoonful of salt.    A table-spoonful of black pepper.    Grate the bread, and having softened the crust in water, mix it  with the crumbs. Prepare all the other ingredients, and mix them  well with the grated bread and egg,    Take the bone out of a leg of pork, and rub the meat well on both  sides with salt. Spread the seasoning thick all over the meat.  Then roll it up very tightly and tie it round with tape.    Put it into a deep dish with a little water, and bake it two  hours. If eaten hot, put an egg and some wine into the gravy. When  cold, cut it down into round slices.      SPICED OYSTERS.      Two hundred large fresh oysters.    Four table-spoonfuls of strong vinegar.    A nutmeg, grated.    Three dozen of cloves, whole.    Eight blades of mace, whole.    Two tea-spoonfuls of salt if the oysters are fresh.    Two tea-spoonfuls of whole allspice.    As much cayenne pepper as will lie on the point of a knife.    Put the oysters, with their liquor, into a large earthen pitcher.  Add to them the vinegar and all the other ingredients. Stir all  well together. Set them in the stove, or over a slow fire, keeping  them covered. Take them off the fire several times, and stir them  to the bottom. As soon as they boil completely they are  sufficiently done; if they boil too long they will be hard.    Pour them directly out of the pitcher into a pan, and set them  away to cool. They must not be eaten till quite cold, or indeed  till next day.    If you wish to keep them a week, put a smaller quantity of spice,  or they will taste too much of it by setting so long. Let them be  well covered.    Oysters in the shell may be kept all winter by laying them in a  heap in the cellar, with the concave side upwards to hold in the  liquor. Sprinkle them every day with strong salt and water, and  then with Indian meal. Cover them with matting or an old carpet.      STEWED OYSTERS.    Open the oysters and strain the liquor. Put to the liquor some  grated stale bread, and a little pepper and nutmeg, adding a glass  of white wine. Boil the liquor with these ingredients, and then  pour it scalding hot over the dish of raw oysters. This will cook  them sufficiently.    Have ready some slices of buttered toast with the crust cut off.  When the oysters are done, dip the toast in the liquor, and lay  the pieces round the sides and in the bottom of a deep dish. Pour  the oysters and liquor upon the toast, and send them to table hot.      OYSTER SOUP      Three pints of large fresh oysters.    Two table-spoonfuls of butter, rolled in flour.    A bunch of sweet herbs.    A saucer full of chopped celery.    A quart of rich milk.    Pepper to your taste.    Take the liquor of three pints of oysters. Strain it, and set it  on the fire. Put into it, pepper to your taste, two table-spoonfuls  of butter rolled in flour, and a bunch of sweet marjoram and  other pot-herbs, with a saucer full of chopped celery. When it  boils, add a quart of rich milk-and as soon as it boils again,  take out the herbs, and put in the oysters just before you send  it to table. Boiling them in the soup will shrivel them and  destroy their taste.      FRIED OYSTERS    For frying, choose the largest and finest oysters. Beat some yolks  of eggs and mix with them grated bread, and a small quantity of  beaten nutmeg and mace and a little salt. Having stirred this  batter well, dip your oysters into it, and fry them in lard, till  they are of a light brown colour. Take care not to do them too  much. Serve them up hot.    For grated bread, some substitute crackers pounded to a powder,  and mixed with yolk of egg and spice.      BAKED OR SCOLLOPED OYSTERS.    Grate a small loaf of stale-bread. Butter a deep dish well, and  cover the sides and bottom with bread crumbs. Put in half the  oysters with a little mace and pepper. Cover them with crumbs and  small bits of butter strewed over them. Then put in the remainder  of the oysters. Season them. Cover them as before with crumbs and  butter. If the oysters are fresh, pour in a little of the liquor.  If they are salt, substitute a little water. Bake them a very  short time. You may cook them in the small scolloped dishes made  for the purpose.      OYSTER PATTIES.    Make some rich puff-paste, and bake it in very small tin patty  pans. When cool, turn them out upon a large dish.    Stew some large fresh oysters with a few cloves, a little mace and  nutmeg, some yolk of egg boiled hard and grated, a little butter,  and as much of the oyster liquor as will cover them. When they  have stewed a little while, take them out of the pan, and set them  away to cool. When quite cold, lay two or three oysters in each  shell of puff-paste.      OYSTER-SAUCE.    When your oysters are opened, take care of all the liquor, and  give them one boil in it. Then take the oysters out, and put to  the liquor three or four blades of mace. Add to it some melted  butter, and some thick cream or rich milk. Put in your oysters and  give them a boil. As soon as they come to a boil, take them of the  fire.      PICKLED OYSTERS.      Four hundred large fresh oysters.    A pint of vinegar.    Eight spoonfuls of salt.    A pint of white wine.    Six table-spoonfuls of whole black pepper.    Eight blades of mace.    Strain the liquor of the oysters and boil it. Then pour it hot  over the oysters, and let them lie in it about ten minutes. Then  take them out, and cover them. Boil the liquor with the salt,  pepper, mace, vinegar and wine. When cold, put the oysters in a  close jar, and pour the liquor over them. Cover the jar very  tight, and the oysters will keep a long time.    If the oysters are salt, put no salt to the liquor.      CHICKEN SALAD.      Two large cold fowls, either boiled or roasted.    The yolks of nine hard-boiled eggs.    Half a pint of sweet oil.    Half a pint of vinegar.    A gill of mixed mustard.    A small tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper.    A small tea-spoonful of salt.    Two large heads, or four small ones, of fine celery.    Cut the meat of the fowls from the bones, in pieces not exceeding  an inch in size.    Cut the white part of the celery into pieces about an inch long.  Mix the chicken and celery well together. Cover them and set them  away.    With the back of a wooden spoon, mash the yolks of eggs till they  are a perfectly smooth paste. Mix them with the oil, vinegar,  mustard, cayenne, and salt. Stir them for a long time, till they  are thoroughly mixed and quite smooth. The longer they are stirred  the better. When this dressing is sufficiently mixed, cover it,  and set it away.    Five minutes before the salad is to be eaten pour the dressing  over the chicken and celery, and mix all well together. If the  dressing is put on long before it is wanted, the salad will be  tough and hard.    This salad is very excellent made of cold turkey instead of  chicken.      LOBSTER SALAD.    Take two large boiled lobsters. Extract all the meat from the  shell, and cut it up into very small pieces.    For lobster salad, you must have lettuce instead of celery. Cut up  the lettuce as small as possible.    Make a dressing as for a chicken-salad, with the yolks of nine  hard-boiled eggs, half a pint of sweet oil, half a pint of  vinegar, a gill of mustard, a tea-spoonful of cayenne, and a  tea-spoonful of salt. Mix all well together with a wooden spoon.    A few minutes before it is to be eaten, pour the dressing over the  lobster and lettuce and mix it very well.      STEWED MUSHROOMS.    Take a quart of fresh mushrooms. Peel them and cut off the stems.  Season them with pepper and salt. Put them in a sauce-pan or  skillet, with a lump of fresh butter the size of an egg, and  sufficient cream or rich milk to cover them. Put on the lid of the  pan, and stew the mushrooms about a quarter of an hour, keeping  them well covered or the flavour will evaporate.    When you take them off the fire, have ready one or two beaten  eggs. Stir the eggs gradually into the stew, and send it to"]]]
