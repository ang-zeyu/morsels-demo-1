He knew his brother's abilities; he knew his  insinuating address--had he not influenced their father to give him  wealth while he was yet alive? He was aware also that his brother had  visited the Palace often of late. It would seem as though the Prince  Pasha was ready to make him, as well as David, a favourite. But the  face of the girl--it was an English face! Familiar with the Palace,  and bribing when it was necessary to bribe, Foorgat Bey had evidently  brought her to see the function, there where all women were forbidden.  He could little imagine Foorgat doing this from mere courtesy; he could  not imagine any woman, save one wholly sophisticated, or one entirely  innocent, trusting herself with him--and in such a place. The girl's  face, though not that of one in her teens, had seemed to him a very  flower of innocence.    But, as he stood telling his beads, abstractedly listening to the  scandal talked by Achmet and Higli, he was not thinking of his brother,  but of the two who had just left the chamber. He was speculating as  to which room they were likely to enter. They had not gone by the door  convenient to passage to Kaid's own apartments. He would give much to  hear the conversation between Kaid and the stranger; he was all too  conscious of its purport. As he stood thinking, Kaid returned. After  looking round the room for a moment, the Prince came slowly over to  Nahoum, and, stretching out a hand, stroked his beard.    \"Oh, brother of all the wise, may thy sun never pass its noon!\" said  Kaid, in a low, friendly voice.    Despite his will, a shudder passed through Nahoum Pasha's frame.  How often in Egypt this gesture and such words were the prelude to  assassination, from which there was no escape save by death itself. Into  Nahoum's mind there flashed the words of an Arab teacher, \"There is  no refuge from God but God Himself,\" and he found himself blindly  wondering, even as he felt Kaid's hand upon his beard and listened to  the honeyed words, what manner of death was now preparing for him, and  what death of his own contriving should intervene. Escape, he knew,  there was none, if his death was determined on; for spies were  everywhere, and slaves in the pay of Kaid were everywhere, and such as  were not could be bought or compelled, even if he took refuge in the  house of a foreign consul. The lean, invisible, ghastly arm of death  could find him, if Kaid willed, though he delved in the bowels of the  Cairene earth, or climbed to an eagle's eyrie in the Libyan Hills.  Whether it was diamond-dust or Achmet's thin thong that stopped the  breath, it mattered not; it was sure. Yet he was not of the breed to  tremble under the descending sword, and he had long accustomed himself  to the chance of \"sudden demise.\" It had been chief among the chances he  had taken when he entered the high and perilous service of Kaid. Now,  as he felt the secret joy of these dark spirits surrounding him--Achmet,  and High Pasha, who kept saying beneath his breath in thankfulness  that it was not his turn, Praise be to God!--as he, felt their secret  self-gratulations, and their evil joy over his prospective downfall,  he settled himself steadily, made a low salutation to Kaid, and calmly  awaited further speech. It came soon enough.    \"It is written upon a cucumber leaf--does not the world read it?--that  Nahoum Pasha's form shall cast a longer shadow than the trees; so that  every man in Egypt shall, thinking on him, be as covetous as Ashaah, who  knew but one thing more covetous than himself--the sheep that mistook  the rainbow for a rope of hay, and, jumping for it, broke his neck.\"    Kaid laughed softly at his own words.    With his eye meeting Kaid's again, after a low salaam, Nahoum made  answer:    \"I would that the lance of my fame might sheathe itself in the breasts  of thy enemies, Effendina.\"    \"Thy tongue does that office well,\" was the reply. Once more Kaid laid  a gentle hand upon Nahoum's beard. Then, with a gesture towards the  consuls and Europeans, he said to them in French: \"If I might but beg  your presence for yet a little time!\" Then he turned and walked away. He  left by a door leading to his own apartments.    When he had gone, Nahoum swung slowly round and faced the agitated  groups.    \"He who sleeps with one eye open sees the sun rise first,\" he said, with  a sarcastic laugh. \"He who goes blindfold never sees it set.\"    Then, with a complacent look upon them all, he slowly left the room by  the door out of which David and Kaid had first passed.    Outside the room his face did not change. His manner had not been  bravado. It was as natural to him as David's manner was to himself. Each  had trained himself in his own way to the mastery of his will, and the  will in each was stronger than any passion of emotion in them. So far  at least it had been so. In David it was the outcome of his faith,  in Nahoum it was the outcome of his philosophy, a simple, fearless  fatalism.    David had been left by Kaid in a small room, little more than an  alcove, next to a larger room richly furnished. Both rooms belonged to a  spacious suite which lay between the harem and the major portion of the  Palace. It had its own entrance and exits from the Palace, opening on  the square at the front, at the back opening on its own garden, which  also had its own exits to the public road. The quarters of the Chief  Eunuch separated the suite from the harem, and Mizraim, the present  Chief Eunuch, was a man of power in the Palace, knew more secrets, was  more courted, and was richer than some of the princes. Nahoum had an  office in the Palace, also, which gave him the freedom of the place, and  brought him often in touch with the Chief Eunuch. He had made Mizraim  a fast friend ever since the day he had, by an able device, saved the  Chief Eunuch from determined robbery by the former Prince Pasha, with  whom he had suddenly come out of favour.    When Nahoum left the great salon, he directed his steps towards the  quarters of the Chief Eunuch, thinking of David, with a vague desire  for pursuit and conflict. He was too much of a philosopher to seek to do  David physical injury--a futile act; for it could do him no good in the  end, could not mend his own fortunes; and, merciless as he could be on  occasion, he had no love of bloodshed. Besides, the game afoot was not  of his making, and he was ready to await the finish, the more so because  he was sure that to-morrow would bring forth momentous things. There was  a crisis in the Soudan, there was trouble in the army, there was  dark conspiracy of which he knew the heart, and anything might happen  to-morrow! He had yet some cards to play, and Achmet and Higli--and  another very high and great--might be delivered over to Kaid's deadly  purposes rather than himself tomorrow. What he knew Kaid did not know.  He had not meant to act yet; but new facts faced him, and he must make  one struggle for his life. But as he went towards Mizraim's quarters he  saw no sure escape from the stage of those untoward events, save by the  exit which is for all in some appointed hour.    He was not, however, more perplexed and troubled than David, who, in  the little room where he had been brought and left alone with coffee and  cigarettes, served by a slave from some distant portion of the Palace,  sat facing his future.    David looked round the little room. Upon the walls hung weapons of every  kind--from a polished dagger of Toledo to a Damascus blade, suits of  chain armour, long-handled, two-edged Arab swords, pistols which had  been used in the Syrian wars of Ibrahim, lances which had been taken  from the Druses at Palmyra, rude battle-axes from the tribes of the  Soudan, and neboots of dom-wood which had done service against  Napoleon at Damietta. The cushions among which he sat had come from  Constantinople, the rug at his feet from Tiflis, the prayer-rug on the  wall from Mecca.    All that he saw was as unlike what he had known in past years as though  he had come to Mars or Jupiter. All that he had heard recalled to him  his first readings in the Old Testament--the story of Nebuchadnezzar, of  Belshazzar, of Ahasuerus--of Ahasuerus! He suddenly remembered the  face he had seen looking down at the Prince's table from the panel of  mooshrabieh. That English face--where was it? Why was it there? Who  was the man with her? Whose the dark face peering scornfully over her  shoulder? The face of an English girl in that place dedicated to sombre  intrigue, to the dark effacement of women, to the darker effacement of  life, as he well knew, all too often! In looking at this prospect for  good work in the cause of civilisation, he was not deceived, he was not  allured. He knew into what subterranean ways he must walk, through what  mazes of treachery and falsehood he must find his way; and though he  did not know to the full the corruption which it was his duty to Kaid  to turn to incorruption, he knew enough to give his spirit pause. What  would be--what could be--the end? Would he not prove to be as much out  of place as was the face of that English girl? The English girl! England  rushed back upon him--the love of those at home; of his father, the only  father he had ever known; of Faith, the only mother or sister he had  ever known; of old John Fairley; the love of the woods and the hills  where he had wandered came upon him. There was work to do in England,  work too little done--the memory of the great meeting at Heddington  flashed upon him. Could his labour and his skill, if he had any, not be  used there? Ah, the green fields, the soft grey skies, the quiet vale,  the brave, self-respecting, toiling millions, the beautiful sense of law  and order and goodness! Could his gifts and labours not be used there?  Could not--    He was suddenly startled by a smothered cry, then a call of distress. It  was the voice of a woman.    He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#13)"],[1," cosmology, because of that native  perception of identity which made mere size of no account to him. In  the atom of magnetic iron, he saw the quality which would generate the  spiral motion of sun and planet.    The thoughts in which he lived were, the universality of each law in  nature; the Platonic doctrine of the scale or degrees; the version or  conversion of each into other, and so the correspondence of all the  parts; the fine secret that little explains large, and large, little;  the centrality of man in nature, and the connection that subsists  throughout all things: he saw that the human body was strictly  universal, or an instrument through which the soul feeds and is fed  by the whole of matter: so that he held, in exact antagonism to the  skeptics, that, \"the wiser a man is, the more will he be a worshipper  of the Deity.\" In short, he was a believer in the Identity-philosophy,  which he held not idly, as the dreamers of Berlin or Boston, but which  he experimented with and established through years of labor, with the  heart and strength of the rudest Viking that his rough Sweden ever  sent to battle.    This theory dates from the oldest philosophers, and derives perhaps  its best illustration from the newest. It is this: that nature iterates  her means perpetually on successive planes. In the old aphorism, nature  is always self-similar. In the plant, the eye or germinative point  opens to a leaf, then to another leaf, with a power of transforming  the leaf into radicle, stamen, pistil, petal, bract, sepal, or seed.  The whole art of the plant is still to repeat leaf on leaf without  end, the more or less of heat, light, moisture, and food, determining  the form it shall assume. In the animal, nature makes a vertebra, or  a spine of vertebrae, and helps herself still by a new spine, with a  limited power of modifying its form,--spine on spine, to the end of  the world. A poetic anatomist, in our own day, teaches that a snake,  being a horizontal line, and man, being an erect line, constitute a  right angle; and, between the lines of this mystical quadrant, all  animate beings find their place; and he assumes the hair-worm, the  span-worm, or the snake, as the type of prediction of the spine.  Manifestly, at the end of the spine, nature puts out smaller spines,  as arms; at the end of the arms, new spines, as hands; at the other  end, she repeats the process, as legs and feet. At the top of the  column, she puts out another spine, which doubles or loops itself over,  as a span-worm, into a ball, and forms the skull, with extremities  again; the hands being now the upper jaw, the feet the lower jaw, the  fingers and toes being represented this time by upper and lower teeth.  This new spine is destined to high uses. It is a new man on the  shoulders of the last. It can almost shed its trunk, and manage to  live alone, according to the Platonic idea in the Timaeus. Within it,  on a higher plane, all that was done in the trunk repeats itself.  Nature recites her lesson once more in a higher mood. The mind is a  finer body, and resumes its functions of feeding, digesting, absorbing,  excluding, and generating, in a new and ethereal element. Here, in the  brain, is all the process of alimentation repeated, in the acquiring,  comparing, digesting, and assimilating of experience. Here again is  the mystery of generation repeated. In the brain are male and female  faculties; here is marriage, here is fruit. And there is no limit to  this ascending scale, but series on series. Everything, at the end of  one use, is taken up into the next, each series punctually repeating  every organ and process of the last. We are adapted to infinity. We  are hard to please, and love nothing which ends; and in nature is no  end; but everything, at the end of one use, is lifted into a superior,  and the ascent of these things climbs into daemonic and celestial  natures. Creative force, like a musical composer, goes on unweariedly  repeating a simple air or theme now high, now low, in solo, in chorus,  ten thousand times reverberated, till it fills earth and heaven with  the chant.    Gravitation, as explained by Newton, is good, but grandeur, when we  find chemistry only an extension of the law of masses into particles,  and that the atomic theory shows the action of chemistry to be  mechanical also. Metaphysics shows us a sort of gravitation, operative  also in the mental phenomena; and the terrible tabulation of the French  statists brings every piece of whim and humor to be reducible also to  exact numerical rations. If one man in twenty thousand, or in thirty  thousand, eats shoes, or marries his grandmother, then, in every twenty  thousand, or thirty thousand, is found one man who eats shoes, or  marries his grandmother. What we call gravitation, and fancy ultimate,  is one fork of a mightier stream, for which we have yet no name.  Astronomy is excellent; but it must come up into life to have its full  value, and not remain there in globes and spaces. The globule of blood  gyrates around its own axis in the human veins, as the planet in the  sky; and the circles of intellect relate to those of the heavens. Each  law of nature has the like universality; eating, sleep or hybernation,  rotation, generation, metamorphosis, vortical motion, which is seen  in eggs as in planets. These grand rhymes or returns in nature,--the  dear, best-known face startling us at every turn, under a mask so  unexpected that we think it the face of a stranger, and, carrying up  the semblance into divine forms,--delighted the prophetic eye of  Swedenborg; and he must be reckoned a leader in that revolution, which,  by giving to science an idea, has given to an aimless accumulation of  experiments, guidance and form, and a beating heart.    I own, with some regret, that his printed works amount to about fifty  stout octaves, his scientific works being about half of the whole  number; and it appears that a mass of manuscript still unedited remains  in the royal library at Stockholm. The scientific works have just now  been translated into English, in an excellent edition.    Swedenborg printed these scientific books in the ten years from 1734  to 1744, and they remained from that time neglected; and now, after  their century is complete, he has at last found a pupil in Mr.  Wilkinson, in London, a philosophic critic, with a co-equal vigor of  understanding and imagination comparable only to Lord Bacon's, who has  produced his master's buried books to the day, and transferred them,  with every advantage, from their forgotten Latin into English, to go  round the world in our commercial and conquering tongue. This startling  reappearance of Swedenborg, after a hundred years, in his pupil, is  not the least remarkable fact in his history. Aided, it is said, by  the munificence of Mr. Clissold, and also by his literary skill, this  piece of poetic justice is done. The admirable preliminary discourses  with which Mr. Wilkinson has enriched these volumes, throw all the  contemporary philosophy of England into shade, and leave me nothing  to say on their proper grounds.    The \"Animal Kingdom\" is a book of wonderful merits. It was written  with the highest end,--to put science and the soul, long estranged  from each other, at one again. It was an anatomist's account of the  human body, in the highest style of poetry. Nothing can exceed the  bold and brilliant treatment of a subject usually so dry and repulsive.  He saw nature \"wreathing through an everlasting spiral, with wheels  that never dry, on axles that never creak,\" and sometimes sought \"to  uncover those secret recess is where nature is sitting at the fires  in the depths of her laboratory;\" whilst the picture comes recommended  by the hard fidelity with which it is based on practical anatomy. It  is remarkable that this sublime genius decides, peremptorily for the  analytic, against the synthetic method; and, in a book whose genius  is a daring poetic synthesis, claims to confine himself to a rigid  experience.    He knows, if he only, the flowing of nature and how wise was that old  answer of Amasis to him who bade him drink up the sea,--\"Yes, willingly,  if you will stop the rivers that flow in.\" Few knew as much about  nature and her subtle manners, or expressed more subtly her goings.  He thought as large a demand is made on our faith by nature, as by  miracles. \"He noted that in her proceeding from first principles through  her several subordinations, there was no state through which she did  not pass, as if her path lay through all things.\" \"For as often as she  betakes herself upward from visible phenomena, or, in other words,  withdraws herself inward, she instantly, as it were, disappears, while  no one knows what has become of her, or whither she is gone; so that  it is necessary to take science as a guide in pursuing her steps.\"    The pursuing the inquiry under the light of an end or final cause,  gives wonderful animation, a sort of personality to the whole writing.  This book announces his favorite dogmas. The ancient doctrines of  Hippocrates, that the brain is a gland; and of Leucippus, that the  atom may be known by the mass; or, in Plato, the macrocosm by the  microcosm; and, in the verses of Lucretius,--      Ossa videlicet e pauxillis atque minutis    Ossibus sic et de pauxillis atque minutis    Visceribus viscus gigni, sanguenque creari    Sanguinis inter se multis coeuntibus guttis;    Ex aurique putat micis consistere posse    Aurum, et de terris terram concrescere parvis;    Ignibus ex igneis, humorem humoribus esse.
