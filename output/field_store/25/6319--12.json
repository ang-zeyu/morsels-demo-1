The mail company went down fifty miles to Platte bridge to winter.  Marshal Heywood decided to remain with us and live or die, as the  case might be, preferring to be with his brethren. There were no  provisions to be had at the Bridge, for three of us had been down to  see if we could get supplies. We barely got enough to last us back. The  mountaineers there had some cattle but no bread, they lived by hunting.    Game soon became so scarce that we could kill nothing. We ate all the  poor meat; one would get hungry eating it. Finally that was all gone,  nothing now but hides, were left. We made a trial of them. A lot was  cooked and eaten without any seasoning and it made the whole company  sick. Many were so turned against the stuff that it made them sick to  think of it.    We had coffee and some sugar, but drinking coffee seemed to only  destroy the appetite, and stimulate for only a little while. One man  became delirious from drinking so much of it.    Things looked dark, for nothing remained but the poor raw hides taken  from starved cattle. We asked the Lord to direct us what to do. The  brethren did not murmur, but felt to trust in God. We had cooked the  hide, after soaking and scraping the hair off until it was soft and  then ate it, glue and all. This made it rather inclined to stay with us  longer than we desired. Finally I was impressed how to fix the stuff  and gave the company advice, telling them how to cook it; for them to  scorch and scrape the hair off; this had a tendency to kill and purify  the bad taste that scalding gave it. After scraping, boil one hour in  plenty of water, throwing the water away which had extracted all the  glue, then wash and scrape the hide thoroughly, washing in cold water,  then boil to a jelly and let it get cold, and then eat with a little  sugar sprinkled on it. This was considerable trouble, but we had little  else to do and it was better than starving.    We asked the Lord to bless our stomachs and adapt them to this food.  We hadn't the faith to ask him to bless the raw-hide for it was \"hard  stock.\" On eating now all seemed to relish the feast. We were three  days without eating before this second attempt was made. We enjoyed  this sumptuous fare for about six weeks, and never had the gout.    In February the first Indian came to our camp. He was of the Snake  tribe, his people were located a day's travel up the river. At the  time of his arrival we were out of everything, having not only eaten  the hides taken from cattle killed, but had eaten the wrappings from  the wagon-tongues, old moccasin-soles were eaten also, and a piece of  buffalo hide that had been used for a foot mat for two months.    The day the Indian came was fast-day, and for us fast-day in very  truth. We met as usual for we kept our monthly fast-day. During meeting  we became impressed that there were some wrongs existing among the  brethren in camp that should be corrected, and that if we would make  a general cleaning up, and present our case before the Lord, He would  take care of us, for we were there on His business. On questioning some  of the company privately, we found that several had goods in their  possession not belonging to them. When we felt satisfied all goods  were replaced we went _en masse_ and cut a hole in the ice on the river.  There were several carcasses of cattle that had died lying near the  fort, that the wolves had not devoured. Some of the boys, contrary  to counsel, had cut steaks from them during the time we were eating  the hides; it made them quite sick. There was a pile of offal in the  butcher shop from the poor cattle killed. But what looked more tempting  than all to starving men was a pile of more than one hundred fat wolf  carcasses, skinned, piled up and frozen near the fort. They looked very  much like nice fat mutton. Many of the company asked my opinion about  eating them. I told them if they would all do as I advised we would  have a good clean supper of healthy food; that these carcasses were  unclean; that we were on the Lord's service, and did not believe He  wanted us to suffer so much, if we only had faith to trust Him and ask  for better.    We all became united in this feeling. Accordingly we hauled all these  carcasses of cattle, the wolves, also the offal from the store-house  and shoved them into the hole cut in the ice, where they floated off  out of our reach. We then went and washed out our store-house and  presented it before the Lord empty, but clean.    Near sundown the Indian spoken of came to our quarters. Some of the  boys hunted up a small piece of raw hide and gave it to him. He said  he had eaten it before. None of us were able to talk much with him;  we invited him to remain with us over night. Evening came on and no  supper; eight o'clock, no word from any one. And the word had been  positively given that we should have supper. Between eight and nine  o'clock all were sitting waiting, now and then good-naturedly saying it  was most suppertime. No one seemed disheartened.    Bro. Heywood was still with us. All at once we heard a strange noise  resembling human voices down the road. Bro. Heywood rushed out  exclaiming, \"Here comes our supper.\" The voices were loud and in an  unknown tongue. Bro. H. came back a little frightened saying there  was something strange going on down the road. Several of us, taking  our arms, started in the direction of the noise. On getting nearer we  recognized the voices. The Magraw party under Jesse Jones was making  another effort to get through with their coaches; they had got stuck in  a snow drift and the noise we heard was Canadian Frenchmen swearing at  their mules. We helped them out and guided them into the fort. It was a  bitter cold night but we had good houses with rousing fires.    After unhitching and turning out Jesse said, \"I am glad to get here.\" I  replied, \"I am as glad to see you.\" \"Why are you so glad to see us?\" he  asked. I told him we had not a mouthful of anything to eat, nor had we  tasted food that day. \"Then what are you stopping here for?\" I replied,  \"We were waiting for you to bring our supper.\" He laughed and said,  \"Well you shall have it if it takes the last bite we have got.\" He gave  to our cook all of his provisions. About ten o'clock twenty-six hungry  men sat down to about as thankfully a received supper as was ever  partaken of by mortal man.    In January when this party passed through to Platte bridge, I sent word  by them to the mountaineers there that we would pay a good price for  meat brought to us. Two of the best hunters, Messrs. Maxim and Plant,  made the attempt to get us meat, but failed, almost starving themselves  on the hunt. They never reached our fort but returned to their homes on  the Platte.    When Jesse Jones left us going down we had but little provisions on  hand. Maxim and Plant's failure to reach us with food caused the people  at Platte bridge to suppose we had all perished. Jesse told me he fully  expected to find our skeletons.    Some may ask why we did not leave. There was no time during the winter  but what the attempt would have been certain death to some of us. The  company at no time was strong enough to make the trip to Platte bridge,  neither did we wish to abandon our trust that we had accepted with our  eyes wide open to the perils around us.    After supper we found there was scarcely enough left for breakfast.  Jesse asked what we proposed doing. One of the mail company, a  Frenchman, commenced talking with the Indian explaining our situation  to him. He said their camp was also out of meat; that they were hungry,  and that he was out prospecting for game, as there was none in the  neighborhood of their camp; but he thought he could find game next day  if some one would go with him to protect him from the Crow Indians, who  were supposed to be in the direction of the game. This seemed the only  show, so Jesse decided to \"lay over\" and send out his hunter with some  pack animals; also ten of our company, the stoutest and most willing.  They, no doubt, would have fought the whole Crow nation to have  protected our Indian friend.    Late that evening the Frenchman and Indian came into the fort with  their animals loaded with good buffalo meat. I asked about the boys  of our company who went out on foot. The Frenchman answered, \"I left  them about twenty-five miles from here roasting and eating bones and  entrails; they are all right.\" They got in next day, each man loaded  with meat. They were all delighted with the Indian, telling how he  killed the buffalo with his arrows, the Frenchman shooting first and  wounding the animal and the Indian doing the rest.    These Indians of the plains years back killed a great many buffalo with  arrows. They would stick two arrows into a buffalo's heart, crossing  their direction so that as the buffalo ran these arrows would work and  cut his heart almost in two. This would soon bring the poor brute down;  whereas with a single arrow in the heart they would run a long distance.        CHAPTER XVI.    Kindness of Indians in Providing Food--Express from Salt Lake  City--Visit from an Indian Chief--Scanty Food Supply.    The mail company again fitted up with packs, leaving their coaches.  They took Brother Heywood with them. This time making the trip  successfully. They left all the meat they could spare, taking only  scant rations with them.    Brother Heywood, although very weak in body, manifested the spirit of a  hero during the whole time of our suffering. I have always remembered  him with the kindest of feelings. As he sometimes remarks, \"rawhide  makes a strong tie.\"    The Indian went away saying he would tell his people about us, and if  they could find any meat they would divide.    It did not take long for twenty hungry men to eat up our supplies.  About the 4th of March the last morsel had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4657"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"which you drop a little nitrate of  silver, whilst you instil into his ear the pleasing intelligence that  you never take a fee from the poor. He recovers; his report of you  spreads far and wide, crowding your doors with paupers. They come to  you as though you were their servant, and when cured they turn their  backs upon you for ever. Hence it is that European doctors generally  complain of ingratitude on the part of their Oriental patients. It is  true that if you save a man's life, he naturally asks you for the means  of preserving it. Moreover, in none of the Eastern languages with which  I am acquainted is there a single term conveying the meaning of our  \"gratitude,\" and none but Germans[FN#9] have ideas unexplainable by  words. But you must not condemn this absence of a virtue without  considering the cause. An Oriental deems that he has the right to your  surplus. \"Daily bread is divided\" (by heaven), he asserts, and eating  yours, he considers it his own. Thus it is with other things. He is  thankful to Allah for the gifts of the Creator, but he has a claim to  the good offices of a fellow-creature. In rendering him a service you  have but done your duty, and he would not pay you so poor a compliment  as to praise you for the act. He leaves you, his benefactor, with a  short prayer for the length of your days. \"Thank you,\" being expressed  by \"Allah increase thy weal!\" or the selfish wish that your shadow  (with which you protect him and his fellows) may never be less. And  this is probably the last you hear of him.    There is a discomfort in such proceedings, a reasonable,    [p.52]a metaphysical coldness, uglily contrasting in theory with the  genial warmth which a little more heart would infuse into them. In  theory, I say, not in practice. Human nature feels kindness is  displayed to return it in kind. But Easterns do not carry out the idea  of such obligations as we do. What can be more troublesome than, when  you have obliged a man, to run the gauntlet of his and his family's  thanksgivings, to find yourself become a master from being a friend, a  great man when you were an equal; not to be contradicted, where shortly  before every one gave his opinion freely? You must be unamiable if  these considerations deter you from benefiting your friend; yet, I  humbly opine, you still may fear his gratefulness.    To resume. When the mob has raised you to fame, patients of a better  class will slowly appear on the scene. After some coquetting about  \"etiquette,\" whether you are to visit them, or they are to call upon  you, they make up their minds to see you, and to judge with their eyes  whether you are to be trusted or not; whilst you, on your side, set out  with the determination that they shall at once cross the Rubicon,-in  less classical phrase, swallow your drug. If you visit the house, you  insist upon the patient's servants attending you; he must also provide  and pay an ass for your conveyance, no matter if it be only to the  other side of the street. Your confidential man accompanies you, primed  for replies to the \"fifty searching questions\" of the \"servants' hall.\"  You are lifted off the saddle tenderly, as nurses dismount their  charges, when you arrive at the gate; and you waddle upstairs with  dignity. Arrived at the sick room, you salute those present with a  general \"Peace be upon you!\" to which they respond, \"And upon thee be  the peace and the mercy of Allah, and his blessing!\" To the invalid you  say, \"There is nothing the matter, please Allah, except the health;\" to  which the proper answer-for here every    [p.53]sign of ceremony has its countersign[FN#10]-is, \"May Allah give  thee health!\" Then you sit down, and acknowledge the presence of the  company by raising your right hand to your lips and forehead, bowing  the while circularly; each individual returns the civility by a similar  gesture. Then inquiry about the state of your health ensues. Then you  are asked what refreshment you will take: you studiously mention  something not likely to be in the house, but at last you rough it with  a pipe and a cup of coffee. Then you proceed to the patient, who  extends his wrist, and asks you what his complaint is. Then you examine  his tongue, you feel his pulse, you look learned, and-he is talking all  the time-after hearing a detailed list of all his ailments, you gravely  discover them, taking for the same as much praise to yourself as does  the practising phrenologist for a similar simple exercise of the  reasoning faculties. The disease, to be respectable, must invariably be  connected with one of the four temperaments, or the four elements, or  the \"humours of Hippocrates.\" Cure is easy, but it will take time, and  you, the doctor, require attention; any little rudeness it is in your  power to punish by an alteration in the pill, or the powder, and, so  unknown is professional honour, that none will brave your displeasure.  If you would pass for a native practitioner, you must finally proceed  to the most uncomfortable part of your visit, bargaining for fees.  Nothing more effectually arouses suspicion than disinterestedness in a  doctor. I once cured a rich Hazramaut merchant of rheumatism, and  neglected to make him pay for treatment; he carried off one of my  coffee cups, and was unceasingly wondering where I came from. So I made  him produce five piastres, a shilling, which he threw upon the carpet,  cursing Indian avarice. \"You will bring on    [p.54]another illness,\" said my friend, the Haji, when he heard of it.  Properly speaking, the fee for a visit to a respectable man is 20  piastres, but with the rich patient you begin by making a bargain. He  complains, for instance, of dysentery and sciatica. You demand L10 for  the dysentery, and L20 for the sciatica. But you will rarely get it.  The Eastern pays a doctor's bill as an Oirishman does his \"rint,\"  making a grievance of it. Your patient will show indisputable signs of  convalescence: he will laugh and jest half the day; but the moment you  appear, groans and a lengthened visage, and pretended complaints,  welcome you. Then your way is to throw out some such hint as    \"The world is a carcass, and they who seek it are dogs.\"    And you refuse to treat the second disorder, which conduct may bring  the refractory one to his senses. \"Dat Galenus opes,\" however, is a  Western apothegm: the utmost \"Jalinus\" can do for you here is to  provide you with the necessaries and comforts of life. Whatever you  prescribe must be solid and material, and if you accompany it with  something painful, such as rubbing to scarification with a horse-brush,  so much the better. Easterns, like our peasants in Europe, wish the  doctor to \"give them the value of their money.\" Besides which, rough  measures act beneficially upon their imagination. So the Hakim of the  King of Persia cured fevers by the bastinado; patients are beneficially  baked in a bread-oven at Baghdad; and an Egyptian at Alexandria, whose  quartan resisted the strongest appliances of European physic, was  effectually healed by the actual cautery, which a certain Arab Shaykh  applied to the crown of his head. When you administer with your own  hand the remedy-half-a-dozen huge bread pills, dipped in a solution of  aloes or cinnamon water, flavoured with assafoetida, which in the case  of the dyspeptic rich often suffice, if they will but    [p.55]diet themselves-you are careful to say, \"In the name of Allah,  the Compassionate, the Merciful.\" And after the patient has been dosed,  \"Praise be to Allah, the Curer, the Healer;\" you then call for pen,  ink, and paper, and write some such prescription as this:    \"A.[FN#11]    \"In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful, and blessings  and peace be upon our Lord the Apostle, and his family, and his  companions one and all! But afterwards let him take bees-honey and  cinnamon and album graecum, of each half a part, and of ginger a whole  part, which let him pound and mix with the honey, and form boluses,  each bolus the weight of a Miskal, and of it let him use every day a  Miskal on the saliva.[FN#12] Verily its effects are wonderful. And let  him abstain from flesh, fish, vegetables, sweetmeats, flatulent food,  acids of all descriptions, as well as the major ablution, and live in  perfect quiet. So shall he be cured by the help of the King, the  Healer.[FN#13] And The Peace.[FN#14]\"    The diet, I need scarcely say, should be rigorous; nothing has tended  more to bring the European system of medicine into contempt among  Orientals than our inattention to this branch of the therapeutic art.  When an Hindi or a Hindu \"takes medicine,\" he prepares himself for it  by diet and rest two or three days before adhibition, and as gradually,  after the dose, he relapses into his usual habits; if he break through  the regime it is concluded that fatal results must ensue. The ancient  Egyptians we learn from Herodotus devoted a certain number of days in  each month to the use of alteratives, and the    [p.56]period was consecutive, doubtless in order to graduate the  strength of the medicine. The Persians, when under salivation, shut  themselves up in a warm room, never undress, and so carefully guard  against cold that they even drink tepid water. When the Afghan princes  find it necessary to employ Chob-Chini, (the Jin-seng,  [FN#15] or China    [p.57]root so celebrated as a purifier, tonic, and aphrodisiac) they  choose the spring season; they remove to a garden, where flowers and  trees and bubbling streams soothe their senses; they carefully avoid  fatigue and trouble of all kinds, and will not even hear a letter read,  lest it should contain bad news.    When the prescription is written out, you affix an impression of your  ring seal to the beginning and to the end of it, that no one may be  able to add to or take from its contents. And when you send medicine to  a patient of rank, who is sure to have enemies, you"]]]
