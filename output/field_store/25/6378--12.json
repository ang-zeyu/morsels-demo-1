If I were weak I  should leave Naukratis and live in retirement for my grandchild alone;  a whole world, believe me, lies slumbering in that young creature. Many  and many a time already I have longed to leave Egypt, and as often have  conquered the wish. Not because I cannot live without the homage of your  sex; of that I have already had more than enough in my life, but because  I feel that I, the slave-girl and the despised woman once, am now  useful, necessary, almost indispensable indeed, to many free and noble  men. Accustomed as I am, to an extended sphere of work, in its nature  resembling a man's, I could not content myself in living for one being  alone, however dear. I should dry up like a plant removed from a rich  soil into the desert, and should leave my grandchild desolate indeed,  three times orphaned, and alone in the world. No! I shall remain in  Egypt.    \"Now that you are leaving, I shall be really indispensable to our  friends here. Amasis is old; when Psamtik comes to the throne we shall  have infinitely greater difficulties to contend with than heretofore. I  must remain and fight on in the fore-front of our battle for the freedom  and welfare of the Hellenic race. Let them call my efforts unwomanly if  they will. This is, and shall be, the purpose of my life, a purpose to  which I will remain all the more faithful, because it is one of those  to which a woman rarely dares devote her life. During this last night  of tears I have felt that much, very much of that womanly weakness still  lingers in me which forms at once the happiness and misery of our sex.  To preserve this feminine weakness in my granddaughter, united with  perfect womanly delicacy, has been my first duty; my second to free  myself entirely from it. But a war against one's own nature cannot be  carried on without occasional defeat, even if ultimately successful.  When grief and pain are gaining the upperhand and I am well nigh in  despair, my only help lies in remembering my friend Pythagoras, that  noblest among men, and his words: 'Observe a due proportion in all  things, avoid excessive joy as well as complaining grief, and seek to  keep thy soul in tune and harmony like a well-toned harp.'\"       [There is no question that Pythagoras visited Egypt during the reign     of Amasis, probably towards the middle of the 6th century (according     to our reckoning, about 536 B. C.) Herod. II. 81-123. Diod. I. 98.     Rich information about Pythagoras is to be found in the works of the     very learned scholar Roeth, who is however occasionally much too     bold in his conjectures. Pythagoras was the first among Greek     thinkers (speculators). He would not take the name of a wise man or     \"sage,\" but called himself \"Philosophos,\" or a \"friend of wisdom.\"]    \"This Pythagorean inward peace, this deep, untroubled calm, I see daily  before me in my Sappho; and struggle to attain it myself, though many a  stroke of fate untunes the chords of my poor heart. I am calm now! You  would hardly believe what power the mere thought of that first of all  thinkers, that calm, deliberate man, whose life acted on mine like  sweet, soft music, has over me. You knew him, you can understand what  I mean. Now, mention your wish; my heart is as calmly quiet as the Nile  waters which are flowing by so quietly, and I am ready to hear it, be it  good or evil.\"    \"I am glad to see you thus,\" said the Athenian. \"If you had remembered  the noble friend of wisdom, as Pythagoras was wont to call himself a  little sooner, your soul would have regained its balance yesterday. The  master enjoins us to look back every evening on the events, feelings and  actions of the day just past.    \"Now had you done this, you would have felt that the unfeigned  admiration of all your guests, among whom were men of distinguished  merit, outweighed a thousandfold the injurious words of a drunken  libertine; you would have felt too that you were a friend of the gods,  for was it not in your house that the immortals gave that noble old man  at last, after his long years of misfortune, the greatest joy that can  fall to the lot of any human being? and did they not take from you one  friend only in order to replace him in the same moment, by another and a  better? Come, I will hear no contradiction. Now for my request.    \"You know that people sometimes call me an Athenian, sometimes a  Halikarnassian. Now, as the Ionian, AEolian and Dorian mercenaries have  never been on good terms with the Karians, my almost triple descent  (if I may call it so) has proved very useful to me as commander of both  these divisions. Well qualified as Aristomachus may be for the command,  yet in this one point Amasis will miss me; for I found it an easy matter  to settle the differences among the troops and keep them at peace, while  he, as a Spartan, will find it very difficult to keep right with the  Karian soldiers.    \"This double nationality of mine arises from the fact that my father  married a Halikarnassian wife out of a noble Dorian family, and, at the  time of my birth, was staying with her in Halikarnassus, having come  thither in order to take possession of her parental inheritance. So,  though I was taken back to Athens before I was three months old, I  must still be called a Karian, as a man's native land is decided by his  birthplace.    \"In Athens, as a young nobleman, belonging to that most aristocratic  and ancient family, the Philaidae, I was reared and educated in all the  pride of an Attic noble. Pisistratus, brave and clever, and though of  equal, yet by no means of higher birth, than ourselves, for there exists  no family more aristocratic than my father's, gained possession of the  supreme authority. Twice, the nobles, by uniting all their strength,  succeeded in overthrowing him, and when, the third time, assisted by  Lygdamis of Naxos, the Argives and Eretrians, he attempted to return, we  opposed him again. We had encamped by the temple of Minerva at Pallene,  and were engaged in sacrificing to the goddess, early, before our first  meal, when we were suddenly surprised by the clever tyrant, who gained  an easy, bloodless victory over our unarmed troops. As half of the  entire army opposed to the tyrant was under my command, I determined  rather to die than yield, fought with my whole strength, implored the  soldiers to remain steadfast, resisted without yielding a point, but  fell at last with a spear in my shoulder.    \"The Pisistratidae became lords of Athens. I fled to Halikarnassus, my  second home, accompanied by my wife and children. There, my name being  known through some daring military exploits, and, through my having  once conquered in the Pythian games, I was appointed to a command in  the mercenary troops of the King of Egypt; accompanied the expedition  to Cyprus, shared with Aristomachus the renown of having conquered  the birthplace of Aphrodite for Amasis, and finally was named  commander-in-chief of all the mercenaries in Egypt.    \"Last summer my wife died; our children, a boy of eleven and a girl  of ten years, remained with an aunt in Halikarnassus. But she too has  followed to the inexorable Hades, and so, only a few days ago I sent for  the little ones here. They cannot, however, possibly reach Naukratis in  less than three weeks, and yet they will already have set out on their  journey before a letter to countermand my first order could reach them.    \"I must leave Egypt in fourteen days, and cannot therefore receive them  myself.    \"My own intentions are to go to the Thracian Chersonese, where my uncle,  as you know, has been called to fill a high office among the Dolonki.  The children shall follow me thither; my faithful old slave Korax will  remain in Naukratis on purpose to bring them to me.    \"Now, if you will show to me that you are in deed and truth my friend,  will you receive the little ones and take care of them till the next  ship sails for Thrace? But above all, will you carefully conceal them  from the eyes of the crown-prince's spies? You know that Psamtik hates  me mortally, and he could easily revenge himself on the father through  the children. I ask you for this great favor, first, because I know your  kindness by experience; and secondly, because your house has been made  secure by the king's letter of guarantee, and they will therefore be  safe here from the inquiries of the police; notwithstanding that, by the  laws of this most formal country, all strangers, children not excepted,  must give up their names to the officer of the district.    \"You can now judge of the depth of my esteem, Rhodopis; I am committing  into your hands all that makes life precious to me; for even my native  land has ceased to be dear while she submits so ignominiously to her  tyrants. Will you then restore tranquillity to an anxious father's  heart, will you--?\"    \"I will, Phanes, I will!\" cried the aged woman in undisguised delight.  \"You are not asking me for any thing, you are presenting me with a gift.  Oh, how I look forward already to their arrival! And how glad Sappho  will be, when the little creatures come and enliven her solitude! But  this I can assure you, Phanes, I shall not let my little guests depart  with the first Thracian ship. You can surely afford to be separated from  them one short half-year longer, and I promise you they shall receive  the best lessons, and be guided to all that is good and beautiful.\"    \"On that head I have no fear,\" answered Phanes, with a thankful smile.  \"But still you must send off the two little plagues by the first ship;  my anxiety as to Psamtik's revenge is only too well grounded. Take my  most heartfelt thanks beforehand for all the love and kindness which you  will show to my children. I too hope and believe, that the merry little  creatures will be an amusement and pleasure to Sappho"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5529"],[0,"The Bride of the Nile â€” Complete (#13)"],[1,"of Thomas, the relation and  inmate of the wealthiest house in the country; and close to her, from  the rough hewn, dirty dyers' sheds such clear and happy laughter rang  out from a troop of wretched slave wenches, always liable to the blows  of the overseer's rod, that she could not help listening and turning  to look at the girls on whom such an overflow of high spirits and  light-heartedness was bestowed.    A large party had collected under the wide palm-thatched roof of the  dyeing shed-pretty and ugly, brown and fair, tall and short; some  upright and some bent by toil at the loom from early youth, but all  young; not one more than eighteen years old. Slaves were capital,  bearing interest in the form of work and of children. Every slave girl  was married to a slave as soon as she was old enough. Girls and married  women alike were employed in the weaving shop, but the married ones  slept in separate quarters with their husbands and children, while  the maids passed the night in large sleeping-barracks adjoining the  worksheds. They were now enjoying the evening respite and had gathered  in two groups. One party were watching an Egyptian girl who was  scribbling sketches on a tablet; the others were amusing themselves with  a simple game. This consisted in each one in turn flinging her shoe over  her head. If it flew beyond a chalk-line to which she turned her back  she was destined soon to marry the man she loved; if it fell between  her and the mark she must yet have patience, or would be united to a  companion she did not care for.    The girl who was drawing, and round whom at least twenty others were  crowded, was a designer of patterns for weaving; she had too the gift  which had characterized her heathen ancestors, of representing faces  in profile, with a few simple lines, in such a way that, though often  comically distorted, they were easily recognizable. She was executing  these works of art on a wax tablet with a copper stylus, and the others  were to guess for whom they were meant.    One girl only sat by herself by the furthest post of the shed, and gazed  silently into her lap.    Paula looked on and could understand everything that was going forward,  though no coherent sentence was uttered and there was nothing to be  heard but laughter--loud, hearty, irresistible mirth. When a girl threw  the shoe far enough the youthful crowd laughed with all their might,  each one shouting the name of some one who was to marry her successful  companion; if the shoe fell within the line they laughed even louder  than before, and called out the names of all the oldest and dirtiest  slaves. A dusky Syrian had failed to hit the mark, but she boldly seized  the chalk and drew a fresh line between herself and the shoe so that  it lay beyond, at any rate; and their merriment reached a climax when a  number of them rushed up to wipe out the new line, a saucy, crisp-haired  Nubian tossed the shoe in the air and caught it again, while the rest  could not cease for delight in such a good joke and cried every name  they could think of as that of the lover for whom their companion had so  boldly seized a spoke in Fortune's wheel.    Some spirit of mirth seemed to have taken up his quarters in the  draughty shed; the group round the sketcher was not less noisy than the  other. If a likeness was recognized they were all triumphant, if not  they cried the names of this or that one for whom it might be intended.  A storm of applause greeted a successful caricature of the severest of  the overseers. All who saw it held their sides for laughing, and great  was the uproar when one of the girls snatched away the tablet and the  rest fell upon her to scuffle for it.    Paula had watched all this at first with distant amazement, shaking  her head. How could they find so much pleasure in such folly, in such  senseless amusements? When she was but a little child even she, of  course, could laugh at nothing, and these grown-up girls, in their  ignorance and the narrow limitations of their minds, were they not one  and all children still? The walls of the governor's house enclosed their  world, they never looked beyond the present moment--just like children;  and so, like children, they could laugh.    \"Fate,\" thought she, \"at this moment indemnifies them for the misfortune  of their birth and for a thousand days of misery, and presently they  will go tired and happy to bed. I could envy these poor creatures! If it  were permissible I would join them and be a child again.\"    The comic portrait of the overseer was by this time finished, and a  short, stout wench burst into a fit of uproarious and unquenchable  laughter before any of the rest. It came so naturally, too, from the  very depths of her plump little body that Paula, who had certainly not  come hither to be gay, suddenly caught the infection and had to laugh  whether she would or no. Sorrow and anxiety were suddenly forgotten,  thought and calculation were far from her; for some minutes she felt  nothing but that she, too, was laughing heartily, irrepressibly, like  the young healthful human creature that she was. Ah, how good it was  thus to forget herself for once! She did not put this into words, but  she felt it, and she laughed afresh when the girl who had been  sitting apart joined the others, and exclaimed something which was  unintelligible to Paula, but which gave a new impetus to their mirth.    The tall slight form of this maiden was now standing by the fire. Paula  had never seen her before and yet she was by far the handsomest of them  all; but she did not look happy and perhaps was in some pain, for she  had a handkerchief over her head which was tied at the top over the  thick fair hair as though she had the toothache. As she looked at her  Paula recovered herself, and as soon as she began to think merriment was  at an end. The slave-girls were not of this mind; but their laughter  was less innocent and frank than it had been; for it had found an object  which they would have done better to pass by.    The girl with the handkerchief over her head was a slave too, but she  had only lately come into the weaving-sheds after being employed for a  long time at needle work under two old women, widows of slaves. She had  been brought as an infant from Persia to Alexandria with her mother, by  the troops of Heraclius, after the conquest of Chosroes II.; and they  had been bought together for the Mukaukas. When her little one was but  thirteen the mother died under the yoke to which she was not born; the  child was a sweet little girl with a skin as white as the swan and thick  golden hair, which now shone with strange splendor in the firelight.  Orion had remarked her before his journey, and fascinated by the beauty  of the Persian girl, had wished to have her for his own. Servants and  officials, in unscrupulous collusion, had managed to transport her to a  country-house belonging to the Mukaukas on the other side of the Nile,  and there Orion had been able to visit her undisturbed as often as  fancy prompted him. The slave-girl, scarcely yet sixteen, ignorant and  unprotected, had not dared nor desired to resist her master's handsome  son, and when Orion had set out for Constantinople--heedless and weary  already of the girl who had nothing to give him but her beauty--Dame  Neforis found out her connection with her son and ordered the head  overseer to take care that the unhappy girl should not \"ply her  seductive arts\" any more. The man had carried out her instructions by  condemning the fair Persian, according to an ancient custom, to have her  ears cut off. After this cruel punishment the mutilated beauty sank into  a state of melancholy madness, and although the exorcists of the Church  and other thaumaturgists had vainly endeavored to expel the demon of  madness, she remained as before: a gentle, good-humored creature, quiet  and diligent at her work, under the women who had charge of her, and  now in the common work-shop. It was only when she was idle that her  craziness became evident, and of this the other girls took advantage for  their own amusement.    They now led Mandane to the fire, and with farcical reverence requested  her to be seated on her throne--an empty color cask, for she suffered  under the strange permanent delusion that she was the wife of the  Mukaukas George. They laughingly did her homage, craved some favor or  made enquiries as to her husband's health and the state of her affairs.  Hitherto a decent instinct of reserve had kept these poor ignorant  creatures from mentioning Orion's name in her presence, but now a  woolly-headed negress, a lean, spiteful hussy, went up to her, and said  with a horrible grimace:    \"Oh, mistress, and where is your little son Orion?\" The crazy girl did  not seem startled by the question; she replied very gravely: \"I have  married him to the emperor's daughter at Constantinople.\"    \"Hey day! A splendid match!\" exclaimed the black girl. \"Did you know  that the young lord was here again? He has brought home his grand wife  to you no doubt, and we shall see purple and crowns in these parts!\"    These words brought a deep flush into the poor creature's face. She  anxiously pressed her hands on the bandage that covered her ears and  said: \"Really Has he really come home?\"    \"Only quite lately,\" said another and more good-natured girl, to soothe  her.    \"Do not believe her!\" cried the negress. \"And if you want to know the  latest news of him: Last night he was out boating on the Nile with the  tall Syrian. My brother, the boatman, was among the rowers; and he went  on finely with the lady I can tell you, finely....\"    \"My husband, the great Mukaukas?\" asked Mandane, trying to collect her  ideas.    \"No. Your son Orion, who married the emperor's daughter,\" laughed the  negress.    The crazy girl stood up, looked about with a restless glance, and  then, as though she had not fully understood"]]]
