And  though the phenomenon may only be manifest in the less numerous  cases of types which are markedly normal or abnormal, it is none  the less true also in the more numerous cases of ordinary types.    In this connection I may observe that physical and social  conditions have a greater or a less influence in proportion as the  physical and psychical constitution of the individual is more or  less sound and vigorous.  <p 61>    The practical conclusion, therefore, of these general observations  on the natural genesis of crime is this:  Every crime is the  result of individual physical and social conditions; and, since  these conditions have a more or less dominant influence for  various forms of crime, the most certain and profitable mode of  defence which society can employ against criminality is of a  twofold character, and both modes ought to be employed and brought  into action simultaneously--in the first place, the amelioration  of the social conditions, as a natural preventive of crime, in the  nature of a substitute for punishment; and, secondly, measures of  perpetual or temporary elimination of criminals, according as the  influence of biological conditions in the evolution of crime is  all but absolute, or more or less great, and more or less curable.    As a matter of fact, when we follow the periodic variations of  crime, with its measured growth and decrease, we cannot fail to  conclude that these constant and constantly occurring variations  depend upon a corresponding variation of anthropological and  physical factors.  For, whilst criminal statistics are far from  showing the regularity which Quetelet claimed with much  exaggeration, the proportional figures in regard to the bearings  of age, sex, calling, &c., upon criminality exhibit very  insignificant variations from year to year.  And as for the  physical factors, if marked variations are explicable at some  given period, it is nevertheless evident that neither climate, nor  the nature of the soil, nor atmospheric conditions, nor the  seasons, nor the temperature of different years could have  undergone in the last half-<p 62>century such constant and  repeated variations as to correspond to those waves of criminality  which we shall presently exhibit in almost every nation of Europe.    Thus it is to the social factors that we must chiefly attribute  the periodic variations of criminality.  For even the variations  which can be detected in certain anthropological factors, like the  influences of age and sex upon crime, and the more or less marked  outbreak of anti-social and pathological tendencies, depend in  their turn upon social factors, such as the protection accorded to  abandoned infants, the participation of women in non-domestic,  commercial and industrial life, preventive and repressive  measures, and the like.  And again, since the social factors have  special import in occasional crime, and crime by acquired habit,  and since these are the most numerous sections of crime as a  whole, it is clear that the periodic movement of crime must be  attributed in the main to the social factors.  So true is this,  that, as we shall presently see, the gravest crimes, especially  against persons, precisely because they mostly indicate congenital  criminality, follow a more steady and regular movement than these  slighter but far more frequent offences against property, public  order, and persons, of a more occasional character, and that, as  microbes of the world of crime, they are the more direct outcome  of social environment.    It is therefore another point in favour of the experimental school  that it has insisted on this sociological aspect of the problem of  criminality, by showing <p 63>legislators, outside the limits of  their punitive remedies, as easy as they are illusory, how they  might, as far as circumstances will permit, apply a genuine social  remedy to crime.      After these preliminary observations, it is time that we should  take a closer view of the general statistics of the movement of  crime in Europe, so far as they may be followed in official  figures.    Whilst we have no intention of offering a body of comparative  statistics, but only of giving a simple indication of the periodic  movement of crime, these data, which do not render it easy to  compare one country with another, though they are intimately  related so far as each particular country is concerned, suffice to  exhibit a few facts of some considerable importance.    The most conspicuous general phenomenon in the countries here  included is _the steadiness of the gravest forms of crime side by  side with the continuous increase of slighter offences_,  especially in the countries which show a long series of figures,  such as France, England, and Belgium.  This proceeds mainly from  the progressive accumulation of offences against special  enactments, which are constantly being added to the original basis  of the penal code; but it is also a symptom of an actual  transformation in the criminal activity of the century, from  whence, through the gradual substitution of crimes against  property in the great towns for crimes against the person in  earlier centuries, we have a wider extension together with a lower  degree of intensity.  <p 64>    Another characteristic common to the countries under observation  is that, whilst the graver crimes against property show a somewhat  marked diminution, crimes against persons, on the other hand, show  more steadiness, either of regularity, as in France and Belgium,  or of increase, as in England, and still more in Germany.  But  this phenomenon in the case of crimes against the person is in  actual correspondence with criminal activity arising from an  increase of population.  On the other hand--apart from the  transformation of crimes of violence into crimes of craft and  fraud, due to the increase of movable property--the decrease of  offences against property is no more than the manifest effect of  an artificial change of judicial procedure, summary proceedings  taking the place of trial by jury.    An alternation, which is not invalidated by exceptions here and  there, has been observed in the criminality of different  countries, in the periodic movement of crimes and offences against  property and those against the person, of such a kind that years  of increase in the former usually answer to a diminution in the  latter, and _vice vers<a^>_.  The principal factors in the annual  increase of theft, such as scarcity and extremes of weather, cause  a corresponding diminution of violent assaults and bodily harm, of  homicides and indecent assaults, and _vice vers<a^>_.  On the  other hand, offences against property, which are very numerous,  contribute most of all to the total of annual crime; so that the  maximum of 1880 in Italy, as well as in France, Belgium and  Austria, is especially due to the great severity of the  <p 65>winter of 1879-80, which in Italy coincided with an  agricultural crisis, attested by the very high price of corn.  Whereas from 1881 to 1885 there were very mild winters, with more  abundant harvests, and from 1886 a greater extreme of cold and a  more acute economic crisis.    The general tendency of these periodic oscillations of crime in  Italy, as in other European countries, is nevertheless far more  towards increase than towards decrease.  This is also shown by the  proportional triennial averages of crimes and offences placed on  record, and of persons condemned to imprisonment.    In the movement of crime in each country it is necessary to  distinguish special oscillations, more or less prolonged, of  increase or decrease, from its general and permanent tendency.  The latter is determined by the fundamental conditions of each  nation, physical and social, apart from the purely artificial  section of transgressions brought into existence by new laws.  The  special oscillations, on the other hand, are determined by the  annual variations in this or that factor of the more numerous  offences; that is to say, by abundance or scantiness of the  harvests, by the annual variations of temperature, by industrial  and political crises, and the like.    The oblivion of this marked distinction, coupled with the  prejudices of the scientific schools, and even of political  parties, leads to some curious disagreements, and to lively  discussions on the results of criminal statistics.  For on one  side the champions of the classical school plainly see that the  persistent <p 66>increase of crimes and offences amounts to a  proof of that breakdown of penal systems, practical and  theoretical, which have hitherto been applied--as was admitted by  Holtzendorff.  And on the other hand, the increase of crimes is  denied or affirmed for the purpose of supporting or attacking some  particular ministry.  For, in parliaments more than elsewhere,  there is always a deep-seated and vivacious prejudice, a kind of  social artificiality, which causes men to think that the condition  of States, moral and economic, is fundamentally determined far  more by the action of this or that government than by natural  factors, which are mainly superior to and outside of governments  and politicians.    And this is why in Italy there has been much discussion of late,  in scientific publications, at the sittings of the Central  Commission of Judicial Statistics, and even in Parliament, as to  whether crime was increasing or decreasing.    Beltrani-Scalia and Lombroso almost simultaneously called  attention to the growth of Italian crime, and they were succeeded  by various adherents of the positive school, such as Ferri,  Garofalo, Pavia, Pugliese, Guidi, Bournet, Barzilai, and Rossi,  who produced evidence that the general tendency of crime in Italy  was to increase, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47703"],[0,"Wilford Woodruff, Fourth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day (#13)"],[1,"ogether, and the  suckling child play with the serpent in safety.\"    In all the trials incident to the journey, Wilford Woodruff never  murmured. He was a staunch supporter of the Prophet Joseph in all the  latter's counsels and desires, and was so wrapt {44} in the spirit of  his calling and labor that it is doubtful if a thought of trial or  hardship ever entered his mind. This was characteristic of his entire  life. He never undertook a labor assigned him by the Lord and wished  he had not undertaken it. When he put his hand to the plough, he never  turned back.    After the disbanding of Zion's Camp a great trial came to him. He was  a devoted lover of his parents, brothers, and sisters, and had a deep  interest in their salvation. Since he left New York, his brother Azmon  had become disaffected, and wrote a long letter finding fault with  the proceedings of the Church, endeavoring to turn Wilford from his  course. The effect upon Wilford, however, was a deep sorrow for his  brother, and a stronger determination on his own part to live the life  of a Latter-day Saint. He answered his brother's letter, explained the  fallacy of the latter's arguments and complaints, warned him against  opposing the Church, exhorted him to repent, and bore a solemn and  unswerving testimony to the divinity of the calling and the upright,  honorable course of life of the Prophet Joseph Smith.    The Prophet advised all the young men with Zion's Camp who had no  families to stay in Missouri, and not return to Kirtland. \"Not having  any family,\" says Wilford, \"I stopped with Lyman Wight, as did also  Milton Holmes and Heman Hyde. We spent the summer together, laboring  hard, cutting wheat, quarrying rock, making brick, or at anything else  we could find to do. The Prophet organized the Saints in Zion, with a  presidency of three, and a high council. On the 17th of July, 1834, he  met the authorities of the Church at Lyman Wight's, where he gave us  many glorious instructions, he being clothed with the power of God. He  ordained the presidency and the twelve high councilors. All present  voted, with uplifted hands, to sustain the Prophet and the authorities  of Zion. We had a glorious time. This was the last meeting I ever  attended with the Prophet Joseph Smith in the State of Missouri.\"    Wilford Woodruff continued to attend faithfully to all of his religious  duties. Illustrative of his zeal and earnestness is his action relative  to what property he possessed. Notwithstanding the Saints had been  dispossessed of their homes in their central city of Zion, where they  had endeavored to carry out the principle of consecration, and were now  in a broken and scattered {45} condition, Wilford desired to comply  with every law relative to Zion. On December 31, 1834, he consecrated  to the Lord all his earthly possessions. \"Believing it to be the duty  of the Latter-day Saints,\" he writes, \"to consecrate and dedicate all  their property, with themselves, unto God in order to become lawful  heirs to the celestial Kingdom of God, I therefore, with this view,  consecrated all I had (though but little) before Edward Partridge, the  Presiding Bishop of the Church, in Clay County, Missouri, in this form:  'Be it known that I, Wilford Woodruff, do freely covenant with my God,  that I freely consecrate and dedicate myself, together with all my  properties and effects, unto the Lord, for the purpose of assisting in  the building up of His Kingdom and His Zion upon the earth, that I may  keep His law. I lay all before the Bishop of His Church, that I may be  a lawful heir to the celestial Kingdom of God.'\"    The whole life of Wilford Woodruff shows that he would have been  willing to do the same thing at any time, for the same purpose, even  though his possessions could have been counted by the millions. He was  whole-souled, and wholly given up to the service of his God and the  welfare of His people.    {46}        CHAPTER 7.    MISSION TO SOUTHERN STATES, 1834-1836.    A Prayerful Ambition to Preach.--Departure on Mission to  Southern States.--Traveling without Purse or Scrip.--Treatment  Received from Minister.--Tribulations.--A remarkable Dream.--Its  Fulfillment.--Preaching in Memphis.--Ordained an Elder.--Successful  Labors.--Ordained a Seventy.--A Mob Court.--Return to Kirtland.    After Wilford Woodruff received the gospel, he felt an intense desire  to deliver in turn the same message that had brought him such joy, such  assurance, such satisfaction in the service of the Master. The message  that came to him was the most glorious event of his life, and it is  quite natural that he should wish to be a messenger of the same divine  truth to others. The talents with which he had been endowed by his  Maker awakened within him those hopes, aspirations, and ambitions that  were in harmony with those gifts which were peculiar to the man. His  talents made him pre-eminently a messenger of salvation to the world.  It is no wonder that he was prompted by a heartfelt desire to bestow  upon others that which had come with such joy and with such abundance  to him.    He wanted to go on a mission, but felt that he should be called, and  yet he sincerely believed that the Lord would prompt those whose duty  it was to bestow upon him such an honor, such a privilege. He retired  to the woods in prayer. There upon his knees in humility and childlike  simplicity, he told the Lord his wishes and his hopes. He asked Him,  if it was within His holy will, that the way might be opened for him  to preach the gospel in the world. \"Before I arose from my knees,\" he  says, \"the spirit of the Lord rested upon me and bore witness that my  prayer was heard and should be answered upon my head. I arose very  happy and walked through thick woods about forty rods into an open  road. As I entered the roadway, I met Judge Elias Higbee. Brother  Hibgee was a high priest and a very faithful man, one of the noblest  men of God in the last days. I had associated with him daily, but never  mentioned to him my desire to preach the gospel. To my surprise, as  soon as I approached {47} him he said: 'Brother Wilford, the spirit  of the Lord tells me that you should be ordained to go and preach the  gospel.'\"    A few days later, on the 5th of November, 1834, by vote of the branch  of the Church at Adam-ondi-Ahman, Wilford Woodruff was ordained a  priest by Simeon Carter who also ordained Stephen Winchester and Heman  Hyde at the same meeting. He received his license and by appointment  of Bishop Partridge was assigned to Arkansas and Tennessee. In eight  days he left to perform his mission, to be one of the very foremost in  introducing the gospel into the Southern States--a section of the Union  where, since then, so many thousands have received the gospel and have  been gathered to Zion. His faith had been great. The spirit of the Lord  rested upon him and his prayers were promptly answered.    His stay in Missouri after his arrival there with Zion's Camp was not  of long duration. The Saints had been driven from Jackson County and  were busily occupied in building up new communities in other counties.  He was then a young man without a family, and though actively engaged  in every kind of work peculiar to the conditions of those times, he was  free for almost any kind of service that might be required of him. The  spirit of the man, however, was that of the missionary; and the spirit  was so strong within him that he found satisfaction only when the  opportunity came to give expression to his fellow-men of the testimony  which had brought such consolation to his own life.    \"The law of God to us in those days,\" says Wilford in his journal, \"was  to go without purse or scrip. Our journey lay through Jackson County,  from which the Saints had just been driven, and it was dangerous for  a Mormon to be found in that part of the state. We put some Books of  Mormon and some clothing into our valises, strapped these on our backs,  and started on foot. We crossed the ferry into Jackson County, and went  through it. In some instances the Lord preserved us, as it were by  miracle, from the mob. We dared not go to houses and get food, so we  picked and ate raw corn, slept on the ground, and did any way we could  until we got out of the county.    \"We dared not preach while in that county, and we did little preaching  in the state of Missouri. The first time I attempted to preach was on  Sunday, in a tavern, in the early part of {48} December, 1834. It was  snowing at the time, and the room was full of people. As I commenced to  speak, the landlord opened the door, and the snow blew on the people;  when I inquired the object of having the door opened in a snowstorm, he  informed me he wanted some light on the subject. I found that it was  the custom of the country. How much good I did in that sermon I never  knew, and probably never shall know until I meet that congregation in  judgment.    \"In the southern part of Missouri and the northern part of Arkansas,  in 1834, there were very few inhabitants. We visited a place called  Harmony Mission, on the Osage River, one of the most crooked rivers  in the West. This mission was kept by a Presbyterian minister and his  family. We arrived there on Sunday night at sunset. We had walked all  day without anything to eat, and were very hungry and tired. Neither  the minister nor his wife would give us anything to eat, or let us stay  over night, because we were Mormons, and the only chance we had was  to go twelve miles farther down the river, to an Osage Indian trading  post kept by a Frenchman named Jereu; and the wicked priest who would  not give us a piece of bread lied to us about the road, and sent us  across the swamp, where we wallowed knee-deep in mud and water till ten  o'clock at night, in trying to follow the crooked river. We then left  the swamp and put out into the prairie, to lie in the grass for the  night.    \"When we got "]]]
