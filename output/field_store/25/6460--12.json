When he has nothing he is also contented. His philosophy is: _\"Nunca  tenga hambre cuando no hay que comer\"_ (Never be hungry when no food is  to be had).    The estancia, or catile ranch, is a feature of the Argentine prairie.  Some of these establishments are very large, even up to one hundred  square miles in extent. On them hundreds of thousands of cattle, sheep  and horses are herded. \"It is not improbable that there are more cattle  in the pampas and llanos of South America than in all the rest of the  world.\" [Footnote: Dr. Hartwig in \"Argentina,\" 1910] An estancia is  almost invariably called by the name of some saint, as are the  different fields belonging to it. \"Holy Mary field\" and \"Saint Joseph  field\" are common names. Notwithstanding the fact that there may be  thousands of cows on a ranch, the visitor may be unable to get a drop  of milk to drink. \"Cows are not made to milk, but to eat,\" they say.  Life on these establishments is rough and the fare generally very  coarse. Even among the wealthy people I have visited you may sit down  to dinner with nothing but meat put before you, without a bite of bread  or any vegetables. All drink water out of an earthenware pitcher of  peculiar shape, which is the centrepiece of the table.    Around the ranches of the people are many mice, which must be of a  ferocious nature, for if one is caught in a trap it will be found next  morning half, if not almost wholly, eaten by its own comrades. Well is  it called \"the cannibal mouse.\"    In times of drought the heat of the sun dries up all vegetation. The  least spark of fire then suffices to create a mighty blaze, especially  if accompanied by the _pampero_ wind, which blows with irresistible  force in its sweep over hundreds of miles of level ground. The fire,  gathering strength as it goes, drives all before it, or wraps  everything in its devouring flames. Casting a lurid light in the  heavens, towards which rise volumes of smoke, it attracts the attention  of the native, who lifts his starting eyes towards heaven in a  speechless prayer to the Holy Virgin. Madly leaping on his fleetest  horse, without saddle, and often without bridle, he wildly gallops down  the wind, as the roaring, crackling fire gains upon him. In this mad  race for life, men, horses, ostriches, deer, bullocks, etc., join,  striving to excel each other in speed. Strange to say, the horse the  native rides, cheered on by the touch of his master, is often the first  to gain the lake or river, where, beneath its waters at least, refuge  may be found. In their wild stampede, vast herds of cattle trample and  fall on one another and are drowned. A more complete destruction could  not overtake the unfortunate traveller than to be caught by this  remorseless foe, for not even his ashes could be found by mourning  friends. The ground thus burnt retains its heat for days. I have had  occasion to cross blackened wastes a week after this most destructive  force in nature had done its work, and my horse has frequently reared  in the air at the touch of the hot soil on his hoofs.    The Gaucho has a strange method of fighting these fires. Several mares  are killed and opened, and they, by means of lassos, are dragged over  the burning grass.    The immensity of the pampas is so great that one may travel many miles  without sighting a single tree or human habitation. The weary traveller  finds his only shade from the sun's pitiless rays under the broad brim  of his sombrero. At times, with ears forward and extended nostrils, the  horse gazes intently at the rippling blue waters of the _mirage_, that  most tantalizingly deceptive phenomenon of nature. May it never be the  lot of my reader to be misled by the illusive mirage as I have been.  How could I mistake vapor for clear, gurgling water? Yet, how many  times was I here deceived! Visions of great lakes and broad rivers rose  up before me, lapping emerald green shores, where I could cool my  parched tongue and lave in their crystal depths; yet to-day those  waters are as far off as ever, and exist only in my hopes of Paradise.  Not until I stand by the \"River of Life\" shall I behold the reality.    The inhabitant of these treeless, trackless solitudes, which, with  their waving grass, remind one of the bosom of the ocean, develops a  keen sight Where the stranger, after intently gazing, descries nothing,  he will not only inform him that animals are in sight, but will,  moreover, tell him what they are. I am blest with a very clear vision,  but even when, after standing on my horse's back, I have made out  nothing, the Gaucho could tell me that over there was a drove of  cattle, a herd of deer, a troop of horses, or a house.    It is estimated that there are two hundred and forty millions of acres  of wheat land in the Argentine, and of late years the prairie has  developed into one of the largest wheat-producing countries in the  world, and yet only one per cent, of its cultivable area is so far  occupied.    The Gaucho is no farmer, and all his land is given up to cattle  grazing, so _chacras_ are worked generally by foreign settlers. The  province of Entre Rios has been settled largely by Swiss and Italian  farmers from the Piedmont Hills. Baron Hirsch has also planted a colony  of Russian Jews there, and provided them with farm implements. Wheat,  corn, and linseed are the principal crops, but sweet potatoes, tobacco,  and fruit trees do well in this virgin ground, fertilized by the dead  animals of centuries. The soil is rich, and two or three crops can  often be harvested in a year.    No other part of the world has in recent years suffered from such a  plague of locusts as the agricultural districts of Argentina. They come  from the north in clouds that sometimes darken the sun. Some of the  swarms have been estimated to be sixty miles long and from twelve to  fifteen miles wide. Fields which in the morning stand high with waving  corn, are by evening only comparable to ploughed or burnt lands. Even  the roots are eaten up.    In 1907 the Argentine Government organized a bureau for the destruction  of locusts, and in 1908 $4,500,000 was placed by Congress at the  disposal of this commission. An organized service, embracing thousands  of men, is in readiness at any moment to send a force to any place  where danger is reported. Railway trains have been repeatedly stopped,  and literally many tons of them have had to be taken off the track. A  fine of $100 is imposed upon any settler failing to report the presence  of locust swarms or hopper eggs on his land. Various means are adopted  by the land-owner to save what he can from the voracious insects. Men,  women and children mount their horses and drive flocks of sheep to and  fro over the ground to kill them. A squatter with whom I stayed got his  laborers to gallop a troop of mares furiously around his garden to keep  them from settling there. All, however, seemed useless. About midsummer  the locust lays its eggs under an inch or two of soil. Each female will  drop from thirty to fifty eggs, all at the same time, in a mass  resembling a head of wheat. As many as 50,000 eggs have been counted in  a space less than three and a half feet square.    During my sojourn in Entre Rios, the province where this insect seems  to come in greatest numbers, a law was passed that every man over the  age of fourteen years, whether native or foreigner, rich or poor, was  compelled to dig out and carry to Government depots, four pounds weight  of locusts' eggs. It was supposed that this energetic measure would  lessen their numbers. Many tons were collected and burnt, but, I assure  the reader, no appreciable difference whatever was made in their  legions. The young _jumpers_ came, eating all before them, and their  numbers seemed infinite. Men dug trenches, kindled fires, and burned  millions of them. Ditches two yards wide and deep and two hundred feet  long were completely filled up by these living waves. But all efforts  were unavailing--the earth remained covered. A Waldensian acquaintance  suffered for several years from this fearful plague. Some seasons he  was not even able to get back so much as the seed he planted. If the  locusts passed him, it so happened that the _pampero_ wind blew with  such terrific force that we have looked in vain even for the straw. The  latter was actually torn up by the roots and whirled away, none knew  whither. At other times large hailstones, for which the country is  noted, have destroyed everything, or tens of thousands of green  paroquets have done their destructive work. When a five-months' drought  was parching everything, I have heard him reverently pray that God  would spare him wheat sufficient to feed his family. This food God gave  him, and he thankfully invited me to share it. I rejoice in being able  to say that he afterwards became rich, and had his favorite saying,  _\"Dios no me olvidae\"_ (God will not forget me), abundantly verified.    Notwithstanding natural drawbacks, which every country has, Argentina  can claim to have gone forward as no other country has during the last  ten years. There are many estates worth more than a million dollars.  Dr. W. A. Hirot, in \"Argentina,\" says: \"Argentina has more live stock  than any other country of the world. Ten million hides have been  exported in one year, and it is not improbable that there are more  cattle in South America than there are in all the rest of the world  combined.\" Belgium has 220 people occupying the space one person has in  Argentina, so who can prophesy as to its future?

The struggle had been so short that neither Mickey nor  Ethan knew anything of it, until Baldy dropped down among them, and  announced what had taken place.    'Jerusalem! have they come as close as that?' asked the Yankee in  considerable terror.    'Skulp me, if they ain't all around us!' was the reply of the hunter.    'How we ar' to git out o' hyar, ar' a hard thing to tell j'ist now.'    'It's meself that thinks the rid gentlemin have a love fur us, as me  mither obsarved, when she cracked the head of me father,' remarked  Mickey, who had seated himself upon the ground with all the  indifference of an unconcerned spectator.    It was so dark in their cave-like home that they could not see each  other's faces, and could only catch a sort of twilight glimpse of  their forms when they passed close to each other.    It would have made their quarters more pleasant had they struck a  light, but it was too dangerous a proceeding, and no one thought of  it. They could only keep on the alert, and watch for the movement of  their enemies.    The latter, beyond all doubt, were in the immediate vicinity, and  inspired as they were by hate of the most vindictive kind, would not  allow an opportunity to pass of doing all the harm in their power.    The remains of their food was silently eaten in the darkness, when  Baldy said:    'Do yer stay hyar whar ye be till I come back'    'Where might ye be going naow?' inquired Hopkins.    'I'm goin' outside to see what the reds are doin', and to see whether  thar's a chance fur 'em to gobble us up hull.'    'Do yees mind and take care of y'urself, as me mither cautioned me  when I went a shparkin',' said Mickey, who naturally felt some  apprehension, when he saw the trapper on the point of leaving them at  such a dangerous time.    'Yes. Baldy, remember that my fate is wrapped up in yours,' added the  Yankee, whose sympathies were probably excited to a still greater  extent.    'Never mind about Baldy; he has been in such business too often not to  know how to take care of himself.'    'How long do you expect to begone?'' inquired Ethan.    'Mebbe all night, if thar ain't much danger. Ef I find the varments  ar' too thick I'll stay by yer, and if they ain't I'll leave fur  several hours. Leastways, whatever I do, you'll be sure to look out  for the skunks.'    With this parting admonition, the trapper withdrew.    In going out, he made his exit by the same entrance by which all had  come in. He proceeded with great caution, for none knew better than he  the danger of a single misstep. He succeeded, after considerable time,  in reaching a portion of the valley so shrouded in gloom that he was  able to advance without fear of discovery.    He thoroughly reconnoitered every part of the ravine in the immediate  vicinity of the cave, but could discover nothing of the Indians, and  he concluded that they were some distance away.    Having assured himself of this, the trapper cautiously ascended the  side of the ravine, until he reached the open prairie, when he lost no  time in leaving the dangerous place behind him.    He had no intention, however, of deserting his friends, but had simply  gone in quest of the steam man. He comprehended the difficulty under  which they all labored, so long as they were annoyed in this manner by  the constant attacks of the savages, and he had an idea that the  invention of the dwarfed Johnny Brainerd could be turned to a good  account in driving the miscreants away so thoroughly that they would  remain away for a long enough time for them to accomplish something in  the way of gathering the wealth lying all about them.    He recalled the direction which he had seen the puffing giant take,  and he bent his steps accordingly, with only a faint hope of meeting  him without searching the entire night for him. Baldy was shrewd  enough to reason that as the boy would wish some water for his engine,  he would remain in the immediate vicinity of the river until at least  that want could be supplied.    Acting on this supposition, he made his way to the river bank, and  followed so closely to the water that its moonlit surface was  constantly visible to him.    The night was still, and, as he moved silently along, he often paused  and listened, hoping to hear the familiar rattle of the wheels, as the  youngster sped over the prairie.    Without either party knowing it, he passed within a few yards of Duff  McIntosh, the huge trapper, whom he had known so intimately years  before.    But had he been aware of the fact, he would only have turned further  aside, to avoid him; for, when the two trappers, several years  previous, separated, they had been engaged in a deadly quarrel, which  came near resulting fatally to both.    At length the faint rattle of the wheels caught his ear, and he bent  his steps toward the point where he judged the steam man to be.                              CHAPTER XVI. THE REPULSE.    A FEW minutes more satisfied the trapper that he was right. Gradually  out from the darkness the approaching figure resolved itself into the  steam man.    Johnny Brainerd, after leaving the huge trapper so neatly, continued  wandering aimlessly over the prairie at a moderate speed, so as to  guard against the insidious approach of the Indians, or the hunter who  had threatened to confiscate his property in so unjustifiable a  manner.    Fortunately he did not see Baldy until the latter cautiously hailed  him, otherwise he would have fled before ascertaining his identity;  but the moment he recognized his voice he hastened toward him, no less  surprised than pleased at meeting him so unexpectedly.    'Where are Mickey and Ethan?' he inquired, as he leaped alongside of  him.    'In the cave.'    'How is it you are here?'    The trapper briefly explained that he had crept out to hunt him up;  but as there seemed no imminent danger, he deemed it best to leave his  companions there, as if the Indians once gained possession of the  golden ravine, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to displace  them.    Besides, in order to carry out the scheme which he had formed, it was  necessary that two at least should remain in the cave, while the  others were on the outside.    Under the direction of the trapper, the steam man slowly approached  the ravine, keeping at a respectful distance, but so near that if any  sudden emergency should arise, they would be able to render assistance  to their friends.    The boy gave several whistles so as to inform the Irishman and Yankee  of their whereabouts. A few seconds after, and while the noise of the  instrument was echoing over the prairie, a fainter whistle reached  their ears.    'That's the long-legged Yankee!' instantly remarked the trapper; 'he  knows how to make my kind of noise.'    'What does it mean?'    'It means that all is right.'    'Where are the Indians?'    'They ain't fur off. I wish they war further, fur ef it warn't fur  them, we'd had half the yaller metal out of thar by this time.'    Young Brainerd had the reputation of possessing a remarkably keen  vision; but, peer as much as he might, he could detect nothing  unusual. The trapper, however, affirmed that numerous forms could be  seen creeping along-the edge of the prairie, and that these same forms  were more nor less than so many red-skins.    'What are they trying to do?'    'Duono.'    'Hadn't we better withdraw?' inquired Johnny, showing a little  nervousness.    'Not till we know they're after us,' was the quiet reply.    By and by the boy himself was able to get an occasional glimpse of the  shadowy figures moving to and fro.    'I think they are going to surround us,' he added, 'and I feel as  though we ought to get out while we can do so.'    The only reply to this, was by the trapper suddenly bringing his gun  to his shoulder and firing. An agonizing screech, as the savage threw  himself in the air, showed that the shot had not been in vain.    Rather curiously at the same moment the report of a gun in the ravine  reached their ears, followed by the same death-shriek.    'They ain't sleepin' very powerful down thar,' was the pleased remark  of the trapper, as he leisurely reloaded his piece, while the boy  remained in that nervous state, awaiting the permission of Baldy to go  spinning away over the prairie at a rate that would very quickly carry  him beyond all danger.    But the trapper was in no hurry to give the ardently desired  permission. He seemed to have a lingering affection for the place,  which prevented his 'tearing himself away.'    The boy's timidity was not in the least diminished, when several  return shots were fired, the bullets pinging all around them.    'My gracious, Baldy, let's get out of this!' he instantly pleaded,'  starting the man himself.    'Go about fifty feet,' was the reply, 'but not any further.'    It may be said that the steam man fairly leaped over this space, and  somewhat further, like a frightened kangaroo, and even then it would  not have halted had not the trapper given peremptory orders for it to  do so.    The sky was now clear and the moon, riding high and nearly full,  illumined the prairie for a considerable distance, and there was no  fear but that they could detect the approach of the most treacherous  savage, let him come in whatever disguise he chose.    The night wore gradually away, without any particular demonstration  upon the part of either the Indians or white men, although dropping  shots were occasionally exchanged, without any particular result on  either side.    Now and then a red-skin, creeping cautiously along, made his  appearance on the edge of the ravine; but there was too much light for  him to expose himself to the deadly rifle of the trapper, who took a  kind of savage pleasure in sending his leaden messengers after the  aborigines.    This species of sport was not without "]]]
