It was only occasionally that the  recollection came to vex him that this could not last, that--since  his Uncle Ira had played him false--he must return anon to the  place whence he had come.    Why, in a city of all-night restaurants, these parties ever break  up one cannot say, but a merciful Providence sees to it that they  do, and just as Lord Dawlish was contemplating an eternity of the  company of Nutty and his two companions, the end came. Miss  Leonard said that she was tired. Her friend said that it was a  shame to go home at dusk like this, but, if the party was going to  be broken up, she supposed there was nothing else for it. Bill was  too sleepy to say anything.    The Good Sport lived round the corner, and only required Lord  Dawlish's escort for a couple of hundred yards. But Miss Leonard's  hotel was in the neighbourhood of Washington Square, and it was  Nutty's pleasing task to drive her thither. Engaged thus, he  received a shock that electrified him.    'That pal of yours,' said Miss Leonard, drowsily--she was  half-asleep--'what did you say his name was?'    'Chalmers, he told me. I only met him to-night.'    'Well, it isn't; it's something else. It'--Miss Leonard  yawned--'it's Lord something.'    'How do you mean, \"Lord something\"?'    'He's a lord--at least, he was when I met him in London.'    'Are you sure you met him in London?'    'Of course I'm sure. He was at that supper Captain Delaney gave at  Oddy's. There can't be two men in England who dance like that!'    The recollection of Bill's performance stimulated Miss Leonard  into a temporary wakefulness, and she giggled.    'He danced just the same way that night in London. I wish I could  remember his name. I almost had it a dozen times tonight. It's  something with a window in it.'    'A window?' Nutty's brain was a little fatigued and he felt  himself unequal to grasping this. 'How do you mean, a window?'    'No, not a window--a door! I knew it was something about a house.  I know now, his name's Lord Dawlish.'    Nutty's fatigue fell from him like a garment.    'It can't be!'    'It is.'    Miss Leonard's eyes had closed and she spoke in a muffled voice.    'Are you sure?'    'Mm-mm.'    'By gad!'    Nutty was wide awake now and full of inquiries; but his companion  unfortunately was asleep, and he could not put them to her. A  gentleman cannot prod a lady--and his guest, at that--in the ribs  in order to wake her up and ask her questions. Nutty sat back and  gave himself up to feverish thought.    He could think of no reason why Lord Dawlish should have come to  America calling himself William Chalmers, but that was no reason  why he should not have done so. And Daisy Leonard, who all along  had remembered meeting him in London, had identified him.    Nutty was convinced. Arriving finally at Miss Leonard's hotel, he  woke her up and saw her in at the door; then, telling the man to  drive to the lodgings of his new friend, he urged his mind to  rapid thought. He had decided as a first step in the following up  of this matter to invite Bill down to Elizabeth's farm, and the  thought occurred to him that this had better be done to-night, for  he knew by experience that on the morning after these little  jaunts he was seldom in the mood to seek people out and invite  them to go anywhere.    All the way to the flat he continued to think, and it was  wonderful what possibilities there seemed to be in this little  scheme of courting the society of the man who had robbed him of  his inheritance. He had worked on Bill's feelings so successfully  as to elicit a loan of a million dollars, and was just proceeding  to marry him to Elizabeth, when the cab stopped with the sudden  sharpness peculiar to New York cabs, and he woke up, to find  himself at his destination.    Bill was in bed when the bell rang, and received his late host in  his pyjamas, wondering, as he did so, whether this was the New  York custom, to foregather again after a party had been broken up,  and chat till breakfast. But Nutty, it seemed, had come with a  motive, not from a desire for more conversation.    'Sorry to disturb you, old man,' said Nutty. 'I looked in to tell  you that I was going down to the country to-morrow. I wondered  whether you would care to come and spend a day or two with us.'    Bill was delighted. This was better than he had hoped for.    'Rather!' he said. 'Thanks awfully!'    'There are plenty of trains in the afternoon,' said Nutty. 'I  don't suppose either of us will feel like getting up early. I'll  call for you here at half-past six, and we'll have an early dinner  and catch the seven-fifteen, shall we? We live very simply, you  know. You won't mind that?'    'My dear chap!'    'That's all right, then,' said Nutty, closing the door. 'Good  night.'          9      Elizabeth entered Nutty's room and, seating herself on the bed,  surveyed him with a bright, quiet eye that drilled holes in her  brother's uneasy conscience. This was her second visit to him that  morning. She had come an hour ago, bearing breakfast on a tray,  and had departed without saying a word. It was this uncanny  silence of hers even more than the effects--which still lingered--of  his revels in the metropolis that had interfered with Nutty's  enjoyment of the morning meal. Never a hearty breakfaster, he had  found himself under the influence of her wordless disapproval  physically unable to consume the fried egg that confronted him. He  had given it one look; then, endorsing the opinion which he had  once heard a character in a play utter in somewhat similar  circumstances--that there was nothing on earth so homely as an  egg--he had covered it with a handkerchief and tried to pull  himself round with hot tea. He was now smoking a sad cigarette and  waiting for the blow to fall.    Her silence had puzzled him. Though he had tried to give her no  opportunity of getting him alone on the previous evening when he  had arrived at the farm with Lord Dawlish, he had fully expected  that she would have broken in upon him with abuse and recrimination  in the middle of the night. Yet she had not done this, nor had she  spoken to him when bringing him his breakfast. These things found  their explanation in Elizabeth's character, with which Nutty, though  he had known her so long, was but imperfectly acquainted. Elizabeth  had never been angrier with her brother, but an innate goodness of  heart had prevented her falling upon him before he had had rest and  refreshment.    She wanted to massacre him, but at the same time she told herself  that the poor dear must be feeling very, very ill, and should have  a reasonable respite before the slaughter commenced.    It was plain that in her opinion this respite had now lasted long  enough. She looked over her shoulder to make sure that she had  closed the door, then leaned a little forward and spoke.    'Now, Nutty!'    The wretched youth attempted bluster.    'What do you mean--\"Now, Nutty\"? What's the use of looking at a  fellow like that and saying \"Now, Nutty\"? Where's the sense--'    His voice trailed off. He was not a very intelligent young man,  but even he could see that his was not a position where righteous  indignation could be assumed with any solid chance of success. As  a substitute he tried pathos.    'Oo-oo, my head does ache!'    'I wish it would burst,' said his sister, unkindly.    'That's a nice thing to say to a fellow!'    'I'm sorry. I wouldn't have said it--'    'Oh, well!'    'Only I couldn't think of anything worse.'    It began to seem to Nutty that pathos was a bit of a failure too.  As a last resort he fell back on silence. He wriggled as far down  as he could beneath the sheets and breathed in a soft and wounded  sort of way. Elizabeth took up the conversation.    'Nutty,' she said, 'I've struggled for years against the  conviction that you were a perfect idiot. I've forced myself,  against my better judgement, to try to look on you as sane, but  now I give in. I can't believe you are responsible for your  actions. Don't imagine that I am going to heap you with reproaches  because you sneaked off to New York. I'm not even going to tell  you what I thought of you for not sending me a telegram, letting  me know where you were. I can understand all that. You were  disappointed because Uncle Ira had not left you his money, and I  suppose that was your way of working it off. If you had just run  away and come back again with a headache, I'd have treated you  like the Prodigal Son. But there are some things which are too  much, and bringing a perfect stranger back with you for an  indefinite period is one of them. I'm not saying anything against  Mr Chalmers personally. I haven't had time to find out much about  him, except that he's an Englishman; but he looks respectable.  Which, as he's a friend of yours, is more or less of a miracle.'    She raised her eyebrows as a faint moan of protest came from  beneath the sheets.    'You surely,' she said, 'aren't going to suggest at this hour of  the day, Nutty, that your friends aren't the most horrible set of  pests outside a prison? Not that it's likely after all these  months that they are outside a prison. You know perfectly well  that while you were running round New York you collected the most  pernicious bunch of rogues that ever fastened their talons into a  silly child who ought never to have been allowed out without his  nurse.' After which complicated insult Elizabeth paused for  breath, and there was silence for a space.    'Well, as I was saying, I know nothing against this Mr Chalmers.  Probably his finger-prints are in the Rogues' Gallery, and he is  better known to the police as Jack the Blood, or something, but he  hasn't shown that side of him yet. My point is that, whoever he  is, I do not want him or anybody else coming and taking up his  abode here while I have to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6687"],[0,"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (#13)"],[1,"of the temple have either lost the secret of further  caves, or conceal them jealously from Europeans.    Besides the Viharas already described, there are many others, scattered  over the slope of the mountain. These temple-monasteries are all smaller  than the first, but, according to the opinion of some archeologists,  they are much older. To what century or epoch they belong is not known  except to a few Brahmans, who keep silence. Generally speaking, the  position of a European archaeologist in India is very sad. The masses,  drowned in superstition, are utterly unable to be of any use to him, and  the learned Brahmans, initiated into the mysteries of secret libraries  in pagodas, do all they can to prevent archeological research. However,  after all that has happened, it would be unjust to blame the conduct of  the Brahmans in these matters. The bitter experience of many centuries  has taught them that their only weapons are distrust and circumspection,  without these their national history and the most sacred of their  treasures would be irrevocably lost. Political coups d'etat which have  shaken their country to its foundation, Mussulman invasions that proved  so fatal to its welfare, the all-destructive fanaticism of Mussulman  vandals and of Catholic padres, who are ready for anything in order to  secure manuscripts and destroy them--all these form a good excuse  for the action of the Brahmans. However in spite of these manifold  destructive tendencies, there exist in many places in India vast  libraries capable of pouring a bright and new light, not only on the  history of India itself, but also on the darkest problems of universal  history. Some of these libraries, filled with the most precious  manuscripts, are in the possession of native princes and of pagodas  attached to their territories, but the greater part is in the hands  of the Jainas (the oldest of Hindu sects) and of the Rajputana Takurs,  whose ancient hereditary castles are scattered all over Rajistan, like  so many eagles' nests on high rocks. The existence of the celebrated  collections in Jassulmer and Patana is not unknown to the Government,  but they remain wholly beyond its reach. The manuscripts are written in  an ancient and now completely forgotten language, intelligible only to  the high priests and their initiated librarians. One thick folio is  so sacred and inviolable that it rests on a heavy golden chain in the  centre of the temple of Chintamani in Jassulmer, and taken down only  to be dusted and rebound at the advent of each new pontiff. This is  the work of Somaditya Suru Acharya, a great priest of the pre-Mussulman  time, well-known in history. His mantle is still preserved in the  temple, and forms the robe of initiation of every new high priest.  Colonel James Tod, who spent so many years in India and gained the love  of the people as well as of the Brahmans--a most uncommon trait in the  biography of any Anglo-Indian--has written the only true history of  India, but even he was never allowed to touch this folio. Natives  commonly believe that he was offered initiation into the mysteries  at the price of the adoption of their religion. Being a devoted  archaeologist he almost resolved to do so, but, having to return to  England on account of his health, he left this world before he could  return to his adopted country, and thus the enigma of this new book of  the sibyl remains unsolved.    The Takurs of Rajputana, who are said to possess some of the underground  libraries, occupy in India position similar to the position of European  feudal barons of the Middle Ages. Nominally they are dependent on some  of the native princes or on the British Government; but de facto they  are perfectly independent. Their castles are built on high rocks, and  besides the natural difficulty of entering them, their possessors are  made doubly unreachable by the fact that long secret passages exist in  every such castle, known only to the present owner and confided to his  heir only at his death. We have visited two such underground halls, one  of them big enough to contain a whole village. No torture would ever  induce the owners to disclose the secret of their entrances, but the  Yogis and the initiated Adepts come and go freely, entirely trusted by  the Takurs.    A similar story is told concerning the libraries and subterranean  passages of Karli. As for the archaeologists, they are unable even to  determine whether this temple was built by Buddhists or Brahmans.  The huge daghopa that hides the holy of holies from the eyes of the  worshippers is sheltered by a mushroom-shaped roof, and resembles a low  minaret with a cupola. Roofs of this description are called \"umbrellas,\"  and usually shelter the statues of Buddha and of the Chinese sages.  But, on the other hand, the worshippers of Shiva, who possess the temple  nowadays, assert that this low building is nothing but a lingam of  Shiva. Besides, the carvings of gods and goddesses cut out of the rock  forbid one to think that the temple is the production of the Buddhists.  Fergusson writes, \"What is this monument of antiquity? Does it belong  to the Hindus, or to the Buddhists? Has it been built upon plans drawn  since the death of Sakya Sing, or does it belong to a more ancient  religion?\"    That is the question. If Fergusson, being bound by facts existing in  inscriptions to acknowledge the antiquity of Karli, will still persist  in asserting that Elephanta is of much later date, he will scarcely be  able to solve this dilemma, because the two styles are exactly the same,  and the carvings of the latter are still more magnificent. To ascribe  the temples of Elephanta and Kanari to the Buddhists, and to say that  their respective periods correspond to the fourth and fifth centuries  in the first case, and the tenth in the second, is to introduce into  history a very strange and unfounded anachronism. After the first  century A.D. there was not left a single influential Buddhist in India.  Conquered and persecuted by the Brahmans, they emigrated by thousands to  Ceylon and the trans-Himalayan districts. After the death of King Asoka,  Buddhism speedily broke down, and in a short time was entirely displaced  by the theocratic Brahmanism.    Fergusson's hypothesis that the followers of Sakya Sing, driven out by  intolerance from the continent, probably sought shelter on the islands  that surround Bombay, would hardly sustain critical analysis. Elephanta  and Salsetta are quite near to Bombay, two and five miles distant  respectively, and they are full of ancient Hindu temples. Is it  credible, then, that the Brahmans, at the culminating point of their  power, just before the Mussulman invasions, fanatical as they were, and  mortal enemies of the Buddhists, would allow these hated heretics to  build temples within their possessions in general and on Gharipuri  in particular, this latter being an island consecrated to their Hindu  pagodas? It is not necessary to be either a specialist, an architect,  or an eminent archeologist, in order to be convinced at the first glance  that such temples as Elephanta are the work of Cyclopses, requiring  centuries and not years for their construction. Whereas in Karli  everything is built and carved after a perfect plan, in Elephanta it  seems as if thousands of different hands had wrought at different times,  each following its own ideas and fashioning after its own device. All  three caves are dug out of a hard porphyry rock. The first temple is  practically a square, 130 feet 6 inches long and 130 feet wide. It  contains twenty-six thick pillars and sixteen pilasters.    Between some of them there is a distance of 12 or 16 feet, between  others 15 feet 5 inches, 13 feet 3 1/2 inches, and so on. The same lack  of uniformity is found in the pedestals of the columns, the finish and  style of which is constantly varying.    Why, then, should we not pay some attention to the explanations of the  Brahmans? They say that this temple was begun by the sons of Pandu,  after \"the great war,\" Mahabharata, and that after their death every  true believer was bidden to continue the work according to his own  notions. Thus the temple was gradually built during three centuries.  Every one who wished to redeem his sins would bring his chisel and set  to work. Many were the members of royal families, and even kings, who  personally took part in these labors.    On the right hand side of the temple there is a corner stone, a lingam  of Shiva in his character of Fructifying Force, which is sheltered by a  small square chapel with four doors. Round this chapel are many colossal  human figures. According to the Brahmans, these are statues representing  the royal sculptors themselves, they being doorkeepers of the holy of  holies, Hindus of the highest caste. Each of the larger figures leans  upon a dwarf representative of the lower castes, which have been  promoted by the popular fancy to the rank of demons (Pisachas).  Moreover, the temple is full of unskillful work. The Brahmans hold that  such a holy place could not be deserted if men of the preceding and  present generations had not become unworthy of visiting it. As to Kanari  or Kanhari, and some other cave temples, there is not the slightest  doubt that they were all erected by Buddhists. In some of them were  found inscriptions in a perfect state of preservation, and their style  does not remind one in the least of the symbolical buildings of the  Brahmans. Archbishop Heber thinks the Kanari caves were built in the  first or second centuries B.C. But Elephanta is much older and must be  classed among prehistoric monuments, that is to say, its date must  be assigned to the epoch that immediately followed the \"great  war,\" Mahabharata. Unfortunately the date of this war is a point of  disagreement between European scientists; the celebrated and learned  Dr. Martin Haug thinks it is almost antediluvian, "]]]
