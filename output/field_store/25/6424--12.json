Since then men are guilty of the greatest crimes from ambition, and not  from necessity, no one, for instance aims at being a tyrant to keep him  from the cold, hence great honour is due to him who kills not a thief,  but tyrant; so that polity which Phaleas establishes would only be  salutary to prevent little crimes. He has also been very desirous to  establish such rules as will conduce to perfect the internal policy of  his state, and he ought also to have done the same with respect to  its neighbours and all foreign nations; for the considerations of the  military establishment should take place in planning every government,  that it may not be unprovided in case of a war, of which he has said  nothing; so also with respect to property, it ought not only to be  adapted to the exigencies of the state, but also to such dangers as may  arise from without.    Thus it should not be so much as to tempt those who are near, and more  powerful to invade it, while those who possess it are not able to drive  out the invaders, nor so little as that the state should not be able to  go to war with those who are quite equal to itself, and of this he has  determined nothing; it must indeed be allowed that it is advantageous to  a community to be rather rich than poor; probably the proper boundary is  this, not to possess enough to make it worth while for a more powerful  neighbour to attack you, any more than he would those who had not so  much as yourself; thus when Autophradatus proposed to besiege Atarneus,  Eubulus advised him to consider what time it would require to take the  city, and then would have him determine whether it would answer, for  that he should choose, if it would even take less than he proposed,  to quit the place; his saying this made Autophradatus reflect upon the  business and give over the siege. There is, indeed, some advantage in an  equality of goods amongst the citizens to prevent seditions; and yet,  to say truth, no very great one; for men of great abilities will stomach  their being put upon a level with the rest of the community. For  which reason they will very often appear ready for every commotion and  sedition; for the wickedness of mankind is insatiable. For though  at first two oboli might be sufficient, yet when once it is become  customary, they continually want something more, until they set no  limits to their expectations; for it is the nature of our desires to be  boundless, and many live only to gratify them. But for this purpose the  first object is, not so much to establish an equality of fortune, as  to prevent those who are of a good disposition from desiring more than  their own, and those who are of a bad one from being able to acquire it;  and this may be done if they are kept in an inferior station, and not  exposed to injustice. Nor has he treated well the equality of goods, for  he has extended his regulation only to land; whereas a man's substance  consists not only in this, but also in slaves, cattle, money, and all  that variety of things which fall under the name of chattels; now there  must be either an equality established in all these, or some certain  rule, or they must be left entirely at large. It appears too by his  laws, that he intends to establish only a small state, as all the  artificers are to belong to the public, and add nothing to the  complement of citizens; but if all those who are to be employed in  public works are to be the slaves of the public, it should be done  in the same manner as it is at Epidamnum, and as Diophantus formerly  regulated it at Athens. From these particulars any one may nearly judge  whether Phaleas's community is well or ill established.          CHAPTER VIII      Hippodamus, the son of Euruphon a Milesian, contrived the art of laying  out towns, and separated the Pireus. This man was in other respects  too eager after notice, and seemed to many to live in a very affected  manner, with his flowing locks and his expensive ornaments, and a coarse  warm vest which he wore, not only in the winter, but also in the  hot weather. As he was very desirous of the character of a universal  scholar, he was the first who, not being actually engaged in the  management of public affairs, sat himself to inquire what sort of  government was best; and he planned a state, consisting of ten thousand  persons, divided into three parts, one consisting of artisans, another  of husbandmen, and the third of soldiers; he also divided the lands into  three parts, and allotted one to sacred purposes, another to the public,  and the third to individuals. The first of these was to supply what was  necessary for the established worship of the gods; the second was to  be allotted to the support of the soldiery; and the third was to be  the property of the husbandman. He thought also that there need only be  three sorts of laws, corresponding to the three sorts of actions which  can be brought, namely, for assault, trespasses, or death. He ordered  also that there should be a particular court of appeal, into which  all causes might be removed which were supposed to have been unjustly  determined elsewhere; which court should be composed of old men chosen  for that purpose. He thought also [1268a] that they should not pass  sentence by votes; but that every one should bring with him a tablet, on  which he should write, that he found the party guilty, if it was so, but  if not, he should bring a plain tablet; but if he acquitted him of one  part of the indictment but not of the other, he should express that  also on the tablet; for he disapproved of that general custom already  established, as it obliges the judges to be guilty of perjury if they  determined positively either on the one side or the other. He also made  a law, that those should be rewarded who found out anything for the good  of the city, and that the children of those who fell in battle should be  educated at the public expense; which law had never been proposed by any  other legislator, though it is at present in use at Athens as well as in  other cities, he would have the magistrates chosen out of the people  in general, by whom he meant the three parts before spoken of; and that  those who were so elected should be the particular guardians of what  belonged to the public, to strangers, and to orphans.    These are the principal parts and most worthy of notice in Hippodamus's  plan. But some persons might doubt the propriety of his division of the  citizens into three parts; for the artisans, the husbandmen, and the  soldiers are to compose one community, where the husbandmen are to have  no arms, and the artisans neither arms nor land, which would in a manner  render them slaves to the soldiery. It is also impossible that the whole  community should partake of all the honourable employments in it--for  the generals and the guardians of the state must necessarily be  appointed out of the soldiery, and indeed the most honourable  magistrates; but as the two other parts will not have their share in the  government, how can they be expected to have any affection for it? But  it is necessary that the soldiery should be superior to the other two  parts, and this superiority will not be easily gained without they are  very numerous; and if they are so, why should the community consist  of any other members? why should any others have a right to elect the  magistrates? Besides, of what use are the husbandmen to this community?  Artisans, 'tis true, are necessary, for these every city wants, and they  can live upon their business. If the husbandmen indeed furnished the  soldiers with provisions, they would be properly part of the community;  but these are supposed to have their private property, and to cultivate  it for their own use. Moreover, if the soldiers themselves are to  cultivate that common land which is appropriated for their support,  there will be no distinction between the soldier and the husbandman,  which the legislator intended there should be; and if there should be  any others who are to cultivate the private property of the husbandman  and the common lands of the military, there will be a fourth order in  the state which will have no share in it, and always entertain hostile  sentiments towards it. If any one should propose that the same persons  should cultivate their own lands and the public ones also, then there  would be a deficiency [1268b] of provisions to supply two families,  as the lands would not immediately yield enough for themselves and the  soldiers also; and all these things would occasion great confusion.    Nor do I approve of his method of determining causes, when he would  have the judge split the case which comes simply before him; and thus,  instead of being a judge, become an arbitrator. Now when any matter  is brought to arbitration, it is customary for many persons to confer  together upon the business that is before them; but when a cause is  brought before judges it is not so; and many legislators take care  that the judges shall not have it in their power to communicate their  sentiments to each other. Besides, what can prevent confusion on the  bench when one judge thinks a fine should be different from what another  has set it at; one proposing twenty minae, another ten, or be it more  or less, another four, and another five; and it is evident, that in this  manner they will differ from each other, while some will give the whole  damages sued for, and others nothing; in this situation, how shall their  determinations be settled? Besides, a judge cannot be obliged to perjure  himself who simply acquits or condemns, if the action is fairly and  justly brought; for he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6764"],[0,"Army Life in a Black Regiment (#13)"],[1,"she could arrive, was  exposed at certain points to fire from Rebel batteries, and it would  have been unpleasant to begin with a disaster. I remember that, as I  stood on deck, in the still and misty evening, listening with strained  senses for some sound of approach, I heard a low continuous noise from  the distance, more wild and desolate than anything in my memory can  parallel. It came from within the vast girdle of mist, and seemed like  the cry of a myriad of lost souls upon the horizon's verge; it was Dante  become audible: and yet it was but the accumulated cries of innumerable  seafowl at the entrance of the outer bay.    Late that night the Planter arrived. We left St. Simon's on the  following morning, reached Fort Clinch by four o'clock, and there  transferring two hundred men to the very scanty quarters of the John  Adams, allowed the larger transport to go into Fernandina, while the  two other vessels were to ascend the St. Mary's River, unless (as proved  inevitable in the end) the defects in the boiler of the Planter should  oblige her to remain behind. That night I proposed to make a sort of  trial-trip up stream, as far as Township landing, some fifteen miles,  there to pay our respects to Captain Clark's company of cavalry, whose  camp was reported to lie near by. This was included in Corporal Sutton's  programme, and seemed to me more inviting, and far more useful to  the men, than any amount of mere foraging. The thing really desirable  appeared to be to get them under fire as soon as possible, and to teach  them, by a few small successes, the application of what they had learned  in camp-.    I had ascertained that the camp of this company lay five miles from  the landing, and was accessible by two roads, one of which was a  lumber-path, not commonly used, but which Corporal Sutton had helped to  construct, and along which he could easily guide us. The plan was to go  by night, surround the house and negro cabins at the landing (to prevent  an alarm from being given), then to take the side path, and if all went  well, to surprise the camp; but if they got notice of our approach,  through their pickets, we should, at worst, have a fight, in which the  best man must win.    The moon was bright, and the river swift, but easy of navigation thus  far. Just below Township I landed a small advance force, to surround  the houses silently. With them went Corporal Sutton; and when, after  rounding the point, I went on shore with a larger body of men, he met  me with a silent chuckle of delight, and with the information that there  was a negro in a neighboring cabin who had just come from the Rebel  camp, and could give the latest information. While he hunted up this  valuable auxiliary, I mustered my detachment, winnowing out the men who  had coughs (not a few), and sending them ignominiously on board again: a  process I had regularly to perform, during this first season of catarrh,  on all occasions where quiet was needed. The only exception tolerated at  this time was in the case of one man who offered a solemn pledge, that,  if unable to restrain his cough, he would lie down on the ground,  scrape a little hole, and cough into it unheard. The ingenuity of this  proposition was irresistible, and the eager patient was allowed to pass  muster.    It was after midnight when we set off upon our excursion. I had about  a hundred men, marching by the flank, with a small advanced guard,  and also a few flankers, where the ground permitted. I put my Florida  company at the head of the column, and had by my side Captain Metcalf,  an excellent officer, and Sergeant Mclntyre, his first sergeant. We  plunged presently in pine woods, whose resinous smell I can still  remember. Corporal Sutton marched near me, with his captured negro  guide, whose first fear and sullenness had yielded to the magic news of  the President's Proclamation, then just issued, of which Governor Andrew  had sent me a large printed supply;--we seldom found men who could read  it, but they all seemed to feel more secure when they held it in their  hands. We marched on through the woods, with no sound but the peeping of  the frogs in a neighboring marsh, and the occasional yelping of a  dog, as we passed the hut of some \"cracker.\" This yelping always made  Corporal Sutton uneasy; dogs are the detective officers of Slavery's  police.    We had halted once or twice to close up the ranks, and had marched some  two miles, seeing and hearing nothing more. I had got all I could out of  our new guide, and was striding on, rapt in pleasing contemplation.  All had gone so smoothly that I had merely to fancy the rest as being  equally smooth. Already I fancied our little detachment bursting out  of the woods, in swift surprise, upon the Rebel quarters,--already  the opposing commander, after hastily firing a charge or two from his  revolver (of course above my head), had yielded at discretion, and was  gracefully tendering, in a stage attitude, his unavailing sword,--when  suddenly--    There was a trampling of feet among the advanced guard as they came  confusedly to a halt, and almost at the same instant a more ominous  sound, as of galloping horses in the path before us. The moonlight  outside the woods gave that dimness of atmosphere within which is more  bewildering than darkness, because the eyes cannot adapt themselves to  it so well. Yet I fancied, and others aver, that they saw the leader  of an approaching party mounted on a white horse and reining up in the  pathway; others, again, declare that he drew a pistol from the holster  and took aim; others heard the words, \"Charge in upon them! Surround  them!\" But all this was confused by the opening rifle-shots of our  advanced guard, and, as clear observation was impossible, I made the  men fix their bayonets and kneel in the cover on each side the pathway,  and I saw with delight the brave fellows, with Sergeant Mclntyre at  their head, settling down in the grass as coolly and warily as if wild  turkeys were the only game. Perhaps at the first shot a man fell at  my elbow. I felt it no more than if a tree had fallen,--I was so busy  watching my own men and the enemy, and planning what to do next. Some of  our soldiers, misunderstanding the order, \"Fix bayonets,\" were actually  _charging_ with them, dashing off into the dim woods, with nothing to  charge at but the vanishing tail of an imaginary horse,--for we could  really see nothing. This zeal I noted with pleasure, and also with  anxiety, as our greatest danger was from confusion and scattering; and  for infantry to pursue cavalry would be a novel enterprise. Captain  Metcalf stood by me well in keeping the men steady, as did Assistant  Surgeon Minor, and Lieutenant, now Captain, Jackson. How the men in the  rear were behaving I could not tell,--not so coolly, I afterwards found,  because they were more entirely bewildered, supposing, until the shots  came, that the column had simply halted for a moment's rest, as had  been done once or twice before. They did not know who or where their  assailants might be, and the fall of the man beside me created a  hasty rumor that I was killed, so that it was on the whole an alarming  experience for them. They kept together very tolerably, however, while  our assailants, dividing, rode along on each side through the open  pine-barren, firing into our ranks, but mostly over the heads of  the men. My soldiers in turn fired rapidly,--too rapidly, being yet  beginners,--and it was evident that, dim as it was, both sides had  opportunity to do some execution.    I could hardly tell whether the fight had lasted ten minutes or an hour,  when, as the enemy's fire had evidently ceased or slackened, I gave the  order to cease firing. But it was very difficult at first to make them  desist: the taste of gunpowder was too intoxicating. One of them was  heard to mutter, indignantly, \"Why de Cunnel order _Cease firing_, when  de Secesh blazin' away at de rate ob ten dollar a day?\" Every incidental  occurrence seemed somehow to engrave itself upon my perceptions, without  interrupting the main course of thought. Thus I know, that, in one of  the pauses of the affair, there came wailing through the woods a cracked  female voice, as if calling back some stray husband who had run out to  join in the affray, \"John, John, are you going to leave me, John? Are  you going to let me and the children be killed, John?\" I suppose the  poor thing's fears of gunpowder were very genuine; but it was such  a wailing squeak, and so infinitely ludicrous, and John was probably  ensconced so very safely in some hollow tree, that I could see some of  the men showing all their white teeth in the very midst of the fight.  But soon this sound, with all others, had ceased, and left us in  peaceful possession of the field.    I have made the more of this little affair because it was the first  stand-up fight in which my men had been engaged, though they had been  under fire, in an irregular way, in their small early expeditions. To me  personally the event was of the greatest value: it had given us all an  opportunity to test each other, and our abstract surmises were changed  into positive knowledge. Hereafter it was of small importance what  nonsense might be talked or written about colored troops; so long  as mine did not flinch, it made no difference to me. My brave young  officers, themselves mostly new to danger, viewed the matter much as  I did; and yet we were under bonds of life and death to form a correct  opinion, which was more than could be said of the Northern editors, and  our verdict was proportionately of greater value.    I was convinced from appearances that we had been victorious, so far,  though I could not suppose that this would be the last of it. We knew  neither the numbers of the enemy, nor their plans, nor their present  condition: whether they had surprised us or whether we had surprised  them was all a"]]]
