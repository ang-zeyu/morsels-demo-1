Now some one glanced  suddenly at the clock, and exclaimed, \"It's nearly half-past five!\"    The Brownlows looked at one another blankly. Poor Mrs. Brownlow's  smart ribbons drooped in conscious abasement, while mortification and  pride struggled in their wearer's kindly face, over which, after a  moment's silence, one large tear slowly rolled, and dropped off.    Mr. Brownlow gave himself a little shake and sat down, as was his wont  upon critical occasions. As his absent gaze wandered about the room,  so prettily decked for the guests who didn't come, it fell upon a  little worn, gilt-edged volume on the table. At that sight, a new  thought occurred to him. \"Clarissy,\" he said softly, going over to his  wife and putting his arm around her, \"Clarissy, seein's the well-off  folks haven't accepted, don't you think we'd better invite some of the  others in?\" And he pointed significantly toward the window.    Mrs. Brownlow, despatching another tear after the first, nodded. She  was not quite equal to words yet. Being a woman, the neglect of her  little party cut her even more deeply than it did her husband.    Mr. Brownlow stepped to the front door. Nay more, he walked down the  short flight of steps, took one little girl by the hand, and said in  his pleasant, fatherly way,    \"Wouldn't you like to go in and look at the tree? Come, Puss\" (to the  waif at his side), \"we'll start first.\"    With these words he led the way back through the open door, and into  the warm, lighted room. The children hung back a little, but seeing  that no harm came to the first guest, soon flocked in, each trying to  keep behind all the rest, but at the same time shouldering the babies  up into view as before.    In the delightful confusion that followed, the good hosts forgot all  about the miscarriage of their plans. They completely outdid  themselves, in efforts to please their hastily acquired company. Bob  spoke a piece, the girls sang duets. Mrs. Brownlow had held every  individual baby in her motherly arms before half an hour was over. And  as for Mr. Brownlow, it was simply marvelous to see him go among those  children, giving them the presents, and initiating their owners into  the mysterious impelling forces of monkeys with yellow legs and  gymnastic tendencies; filling the boys' pockets with pop-corn, blowing  horns and tin whistles; now assaulting the tree (it had been lighted  throughout, and--bless it--how firm it stood now!) for fresh  novelties, now diving into the kitchen and returning in an unspeakably  cohesive state of breathlessness and molasses candy,--all the while  laughing, talking, patting heads, joking, until the kindly Spirit of  Christmas Present would have wept and smiled at once, for the  pleasure of the sight.    \"And now, my young friends,\" said Mr. Brownlow, raising his voice,  \"we'll have a little ice-cream in the back room. Ladies first,  gentlemen afterward!\" So saying, he gallantly stood on one side, with  a sweep of his hand, to allow Mrs. Brownlow to precede him. But just  as the words left his mouth there came a sharp ring at the door-bell.    \"It's a carriage!\" gasped Mrs. Brownlow, flying to the front window,  and backing precipitately. \"Susie, go to that door an' see who 'tis.  Land sakes, _what_ a mess this parlor's in!\" And she gazed with a true  housekeeper's dismay at the littered carpet and dripping candles.    \"Deacon Holsum and Mrs. Hartwell, Pa!\" announced Susie, throwing open  the parlor door.    The lady thus mentioned came forward with outstretched hand. Catching  a glimpse of Mrs. Brownlow's embarrassed face she exclaimed quickly--    \"Isn't this splendid! Father and I were just driving past, and we saw  your tree through the window, and couldn't resist dropping in upon  you. You won't mind us, will you?\"    \"Mind--you!\" repeated Mrs. Brownlow, in astonishment. \"Why of course  not--only you are so late--we didn't expect\"--    Mrs. Hartwell looked puzzled.    \"Pardon me,--I don't think I quite understand\"--    \"The invitation was for five, you know, ma'am.\"    \"But we received no invitation!\"    Mr. Brownlow, who had greeted the deacon heartily and then listened  with amazement to this conversation, now turned upon Bob, with a  signally futile attempt at a withering glance.    Bob looked as puzzled as the rest, for a moment. Then his face fell,  and he flushed to the roots of his hair.    \"I--I--must have--forgot\"--he stammered.    \"Forgotten what?\"    \"The invitations--they're in my desk now!\"    Thus Bob, with utterly despairing tone and self-abasement.    Mrs. Hartwell's silvery little laugh rang out--it was as near  moonlight playing on the upper keys of an organ as anything you can  imagine--and grasped Mrs. Brownlow's hand.    \"You poor dear!\" she cried, kissing her hostess, who stood speechless,  not knowing whether to laugh or cry, \"so that's why nobody came! But  who has cluttered--who has been having such a good time here, then?\"    Mr. Brownlow silently led the last two arrivals to the door of the  next room, and pointed in. It was now the kind deacon's turn to be  touched.    \"'Into the highways'!\" he murmured, as he looked upon the unwashed,  hungry little circle about the table.    \"I s'pose,\" said Mr. Brownlow doubtfully, \"they'd like to have you sit  down with 'em, just 's if they were folks--if you didn't mind?\"    Mind! I wish you could have seen the rich furs and overcoat come off  and go down on the floor in a heap, before Polly could catch them!    When they were all seated, Mr. Brownlow looked over to the deacon, and  he asked a blessing on the little ones gathered there. \"Thy servants,  the masters of this house, have suffered them to come unto thee,\" he  said in his prayer. \"Wilt thou take them into thine arms, O Father of  lights, and bless them!\"    A momentary hush followed, and then the fun began again. Sweetly and  swiftly kind words flew back and forth across the table, each one  carrying its own golden thread and weaving the hearts of poor and rich  into the one fine fabric of brotherhood and humanity they were meant  to form.    Outside, the snow began to fall once more, each crystaled flake  whispering softly as it touched the earth that Christmas night,  \"_Peace--peace_!\"          VIII    CHRISTMAS ON WHEELS      I    A railroad station in a large city is hardly an inviting spot, at its  best; but at the close of a cold, cheerless, blustering December day,  when biting draughts of wind come scurrying in at every open door,  filling the air with a gray compound of dust and fine snow; when  passengers tramp up and down the long platform, waiting impatiently  for their trains; when newsboys wander about with disconsolate, red  faces, hands in pockets and bundles of unsold papers under their  ragged and shivering arms; when, in general, humankind presents itself  as altogether a frozen, forlorn, discouraged and hopeless race,  condemned to be swept about on the nipping, dusty wind, like Francesca  and her lover, at the rate of thirty miles an hour--then the station  becomes positively unendurable.    So thought Bob Estabrook, as he paced to and fro in the Boston and  Albany depot, traveling-bag in hand, on just such a night as I have  described. Beside him locomotives puffed and plunged and backed on the  shining rails, as if they, too, felt compelled to trot up and down to  keep themselves warm, and in even tolerably good humor.    \"Just my luck!\" growled Bob, with a misanthropic glare at a  loud-voiced family who were passing; \"Christmas coming, two jolly  Brighton parties and an oratorio thrown up, and here am I, fired off  to San Francisco. So much for being junior member of a law firm.  Wonder what\"--    Here the ruffled current of his meditations ran plump against a rock,  and as suddenly diverged from their former course. The rock was no  less than a young person who at that moment approached, with a  gray-haired man, and inquired the way to the ticket-office.    Bob politely gave them the desired information, and watched them with  growing interest as they followed his directions, and stood before the  lighted window. The two silhouettes were decidedly out of the common.  The voice, whose delicate tones still lingered pleasantly about Mr.  Robert Estabrook's fastidious ears, was an individual voice, as  distinguishable from any other he remembered as was the owner's bright  face, the little fur collar beneath it, the daintily-gloved hands, and  the pretty brown traveling suit.    \"Dignified old fellow!\" mused Bob, irrelevantly as the couple moved  toward the train-gates. \"Probably her father. Perhaps--hallo, by  George, they're going on my car!\"    With which breath of summer in his winter of discontent the young man  proceeded to finish his cigar, consult his watch, and, as the last  warning bell rang, step upon the platform of the already moving  Pullman. It must be admitted that as he entered he gave an expectant  glance down the aisle of the car; but the somber curtains hanging from  ceiling to floor told no tales. Too sleepy to speculate, and too  learned in the marvelous acoustic properties of a sleeping-car to  engage the porter in conversation on the subject, he found his berth,  arranged himself for the night with the nonchalance of an old  traveler, and, laying his head upon his vibrating atom of a pillow,  was soon plunged into a dream at least fifty miles long.      II    It was snowing, and snowing hard. Moreover, it had been snowing all  night, and all the afternoon before. The wind rioted furiously over  the broad Missouri plains, alternately building up huge castles of  snow and throwing them down again like a fretful child; overtaking the  belated teamster on his homeward journey, clutching him with its icy  hand, and leaving him buried in a tomb more spotless than the fairest  marble; howling, shrieking, racing madly to and fro, never out of  breath, always the same tireless, pitiless, awful power. Rocks,  fields,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4320"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (#13)"],[1," to their misery is evil, without any farther regard or consideration.  Here then are the faint rudiments, at least, or outlines, of a GENERAL  distinction between actions; and in proportion as the humanity of the  person is supposed to increase, his connexion with those who are injured  or benefited, and his lively conception of their misery or happiness;  his consequent censure or approbation acquires proportionable vigour.  There is no necessity, that a generous action, barely mentioned in an  old history or remote gazette, should communicate any strong feelings  of applause and admiration. Virtue, placed at such a distance, is like a  fixed star, which, though to the eye of reason it may appear as luminous  as the sun in his meridian, is so infinitely removed as to affect the  senses, neither with light nor heat. Bring this virtue nearer, by our  acquaintance or connexion with the persons, or even by an eloquent  recital of the case; our hearts are immediately caught, our sympathy  enlivened, and our cool approbation converted into the warmest  sentiments of friendship and regard. These seem necessary and infallible  consequences of the general principles of human nature, as discovered in  common life and practice.    Again; reverse these views and reasonings: Consider the matter a  posteriori; and weighing the consequences, enquire if the merit of  social virtue be not, in a great measure, derived from the feelings of  humanity, with which it affects the spectators. It appears to be matter  of fact, that the circumstance of UTILITY, in all subjects, is a source  of praise and approbation: That it is constantly appealed to in all  moral decisions concerning the merit and demerit of actions: That it is  the SOLE source of that high regard paid to justice, fidelity, honour,  allegiance, and chastity: That it is inseparable from all the other  social virtues, humanity, generosity, charity, affability, lenity,  mercy, and moderation: And, in a word, that it is a foundation of  the chief part of morals, which has a reference to mankind and our  fellow-creatures.    It appears also, that, in our general approbation of characters and  manners, the useful tendency of the social virtues moves us not by any  regards to self-interest, but has an influence much more universal  and extensive. It appears that a tendency to public good, and to the  promoting of peace, harmony, and order in society, does always, by  affecting the benevolent principles of our frame, engage us on the side  of the social virtues. And it appears, as an additional confirmation,  that these principles of humanity and sympathy enter so deeply into all  our sentiments, and have so powerful an influence, as may enable them  to excite the strongest censure and applause. The present theory is the  simple result of all these inferences, each of which seems founded on  uniform experience and observation.    Were it doubtful, whether there were any such principle in our nature  as humanity or a concern for others, yet when we see, in numberless  instances, that whatever has a tendency to promote the interests of  society, is so highly approved of, we ought thence to learn the force of  the benevolent principle; since it is impossible for anything to please  as means to an end, where the end is totally indifferent. On the other  hand, were it doubtful, whether there were, implanted in our nature, any  general principle of moral blame and approbation, yet when we see, in  numberless instances, the influence of humanity, we ought thence to  conclude, that it is impossible, but that everything which promotes the  interest of society must communicate pleasure, and what is pernicious  give uneasiness. But when these different reflections and observations  concur in establishing the same conclusion, must they not bestow an  undisputed evidence upon it?    It is however hoped, that the progress of this argument will bring a  farther confirmation of the present theory, by showing the rise of other  sentiments of esteem and regard from the same or like principles.          SECTION VI. OF QUALITIES USEFUL TO OURSELVES.        PART I.        IT seems evident, that where a quality or habit is subjected to our  examination, if it appear in any respect prejudicial to the person  possessed of it, or such as incapacitates him for business and action,  it is instantly blamed, and ranked among his faults and imperfections.  Indolence, negligence, want of order and method, obstinacy, fickleness,  rashness, credulity; these qualities were never esteemed by any one  indifferent to a character; much less, extolled as accomplishments or  virtues. The prejudice, resulting from them, immediately strikes our  eye, and gives us the sentiment of pain and disapprobation.    No quality, it is allowed, is absolutely either blameable or  praiseworthy. It is all according to its degree. A due medium, says  the Peripatetics, is the characteristic of virtue. But this medium is  chiefly determined by utility. A proper celerity, for instance, and  dispatch in business, is commendable. When defective, no progress is  ever made in the execution of any purpose: When excessive, it engages  us in precipitate and ill-concerted measures and enterprises: By such  reasonings, we fix the proper and commendable mediocrity in all moral  and prudential disquisitions; and never lose view of the advantages,  which result from any character or habit. Now as these advantages  are enjoyed by the person possessed of the character, it can never  be SELF-LOVE which renders the prospect of them agreeable to us,  the spectators, and prompts our esteem and approbation. No force of  imagination can convert us into another person, and make us fancy, that  we, being that person, reap benefit from those valuable qualities,  which belong to him. Or if it did, no celerity of imagination could  immediately transport us back, into ourselves, and make us love and  esteem the person, as different from us. Views and sentiments, so  opposite to known truth and to each other, could never have place, at  the same time, in the same person. All suspicion, therefore, of selfish  regards, is here totally excluded. It is a quite different principle,  which actuates our bosom, and interests us in the felicity of the person  whom we contemplate. Where his natural talents and acquired abilities  give us the prospect of elevation, advancement, a figure in life,  prosperous success, a steady command over fortune, and the execution of  great or advantageous undertakings; we are struck with such agreeable  images, and feel a complacency and regard immediately arise towards him.  The ideas of happiness, joy, triumph, prosperity, are connected with  every circumstance of his character, and diffuse over our minds a  pleasing sentiment of sympathy and humanity.           [Footnote: One may venture to affirm, that there is no human  nature, to whom the appearance of happiness (where envy or revenge has  no place) does not give pleasure, that of misery, uneasiness. This  seems inseparable from our make and constitution. But they are only more  generous minds, that are thence prompted to seek zealously the good of  others, and to have a real passion for their welfare. With men of narrow  and ungenerous spirits, this sympathy goes not beyond a slight  feeling of the imagination, which serves only to excite sentiments  of complacency or ensure, and makes them apply to the object either  honorable or dishonorable appellations. A griping miser, for instance,  praises extremely INDUSTRY and FRUGALITY even in others, and sets them,  in his estimation, above all the other virtues. He knows the good that  results from them, and feels that species of happiness with a more  lively sympathy, than any other you could represent to him; though  perhaps he would not part with a shilling to make the fortune of the  industrious man, whom he praises so highly.]    Let us suppose a person originally framed so as to have no manner of  concern for his fellow-creatures, but to regard the happiness and  misery of all sensible beings with greater indifference than even two  contiguous shades of the same colour. Let us suppose, if the prosperity  of nations were laid on the one hand, and their ruin on the other, and  he were desired to choose; that he would stand like the schoolman's ass,  irresolute and undetermined, between equal motives; or rather, like the  same ass between two pieces of wood or marble, without any inclination  or propensity to either side. The consequence, I believe, must be  allowed just, that such a person, being absolutely unconcerned, either  for the public good of a community or the private utility of others,  would look on every quality, however pernicious, or however beneficial,  to society, or to its possessor, with the same indifference as on the  most common and uninteresting object.    But if, instead of this fancied monster, we suppose a MAN to form  a judgement or determination in the case, there is to him a plain  foundation of preference, where everything else is equal; and however  cool his choice may be, if his heart be selfish, or if the persons  interested be remote from him; there must still be a choice or  distinction between what is useful, and what is pernicious. Now this  distinction is the same in all its parts, with the MORAL DISTINCTION,  whose foundation has been so often, and so much in vain, enquired after.  The same endowments of the mind, in every circumstance, are agreeable  to the sentiment of morals and to that of humanity; the same temper is  susceptible of high degrees of the one sentiment and of the other;  and the same alteration in the objects, by their nearer approach or  by connexions, enlivens the one and the other. By all the rules of  philosophy, therefore, we must conclude, that these sentiments are  originally the same; since, in each particular, even the most minute,  they are governed by the same"]]]
