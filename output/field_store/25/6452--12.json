His companions seemed ever to play  intolerable parts.  They were ever upraising the ghost of shame on the  stick of their curiosity.  He turned toward the tattered man as one at  bay.  \"Now, don't bother me,\" he repeated with desperate menace.    \"Well, Lord knows I don't wanta bother anybody,\" said the other.  There  was a little accent of despair in his voice as he replied, \"Lord knows  I 've gota 'nough m' own t' tend to.\"    The youth, who had been holding a bitter debate with himself and  casting glances of hatred and contempt at the tattered man, here spoke  in a hard voice.  \"Good-by,\" he said.    The tattered man looked at him in gaping amazement.  \"Why--why,  pardner, where yeh goin'?\" he asked unsteadily.  The youth looking at  him, could see that he, too, like that other one, was beginning to act  dumb and animal-like.  His thoughts seemed to be floundering about in  his head.  \"Now--now--look--a--here, you Tom Jamison--now--I won't have  this--this here won't do. Where--where yeh goin'?\"    The youth pointed vaguely.  \"Over there,\" he replied.    \"Well, now look--a--here--now,\" said the tattered man, rambling on in  idiot fashion.  His head was hanging forward and his words were  slurred.  \"This thing won't do, now, Tom Jamison.  It won't do.  I know  yeh, yeh pig-headed devil.  Yeh wanta go trompin' off with a bad hurt.  It ain't right--now--Tom Jamison--it ain't.  Yeh wanta leave me take  keer of yeh, Tom Jamison.  It ain't--right--it ain't--fer yeh t'  go--trompin' off--with a bad hurt--it ain't--ain't--ain't right--it  ain't.\"    In reply the youth climbed a fence and started away.  He could hear the  tattered man bleating plaintively.    Once he faced about angrily.  \"What?\"    \"Look--a--here, now, Tom Jamison--now--it ain't--\"    The youth went on.  Turning at a distance he saw the tattered man  wandering about helplessly in the field.    He now thought that he wished he was dead.  He believed he envied those  men whose bodies lay strewn over the grass of the fields and on the  fallen leaves of the forest.    The simple questions of the tattered man had been knife thrusts to him.  They asserted a society that probes pitilessly at secrets until all is  apparent.  His late companion's chance persistency made him feel that  he could not keep his crime concealed in his bosom.  It was sure to be  brought plain by one of those arrows which cloud the air and are  constantly pricking, discovering, proclaiming those things which are  willed to be forever hidden.  He admitted that he could not defend  himself against this agency.  It was not within the power of vigilance.          Chapter 11      He became aware that the furnace roar of the battle was growing louder.  Great blown clouds had floated to the still heights of air before him.  The noise, too, was approaching.  The woods filtered men and the fields  became dotted.    As he rounded a hillock, he perceived that the roadway was now a crying  mass of wagons, teams, and men.  From the heaving tangle issued  exhortations, commands, imprecations.  Fear was sweeping it all along.  The cracking whips bit and horses plunged and tugged.  The white-topped  wagons strained and stumbled in their exertions like fat sheep.    The youth felt comforted in a measure by this sight.  They were all  retreating.  Perhaps, then, he was not so bad after all.  He seated  himself and watched the terror-stricken wagons.  They fled like soft,  ungainly animals.  All the roarers and lashers served to help him to  magnify the dangers and horrors of the engagement that he might try to  prove to himself that the thing with which men could charge him was in  truth a symmetrical act.  There was an amount of pleasure to him in  watching the wild march of this vindication.    Presently the calm head of a forward-going column of infantry appeared  in the road.  It came swiftly on.  Avoiding the obstructions gave it  the sinuous movement of a serpent.  The men at the head butted mules  with their musket stocks.  They prodded teamsters indifferent to all  howls.  The men forced their way through parts of the dense mass by  strength.  The blunt head of the column pushed.  The raving teamsters  swore many strange oaths.    The commands to make way had the ring of a great importance in them.  The men were going forward to the heart of the din.  They were to  confront the eager rush of the enemy.  They felt the pride of their  onward movement when the remainder of the army seemed trying to dribble  down this road.  They tumbled teams about with a fine feeling that it  was no matter so long as their column got to the front in time.  This  importance made their faces grave and stern.  And the backs of the  officers were very rigid.    As the youth looked at them the black weight of his woe returned to  him. He felt that he was regarding a procession of chosen beings.  The  separation was as great to him as if they had marched with weapons of  flame and banners of sunlight.  He could never be like them.  He could  have wept in his longings.    He searched about in his mind for an adequate malediction for the  indefinite cause, the thing upon which men turn the words of final  blame.  It--whatever it was--was responsible for him, he said.  There  lay the fault.    The haste of the column to reach the battle seemed to the forlorn young  man to be something much finer than stout fighting.  Heroes, he  thought, could find excuses in that long seething lane.  They could  retire with perfect self-respect and make excuses to the stars.    He wondered what those men had eaten that they could be in such haste  to force their way to grim chances of death.  As he watched his envy  grew until he thought that he wished to change lives with one of them.  He would have liked to have used a tremendous force, he said, throw off  himself and become a better.  Swift pictures of himself, apart, yet in  himself, came to him--a blue desperate figure leading lurid charges  with one knee forward and a broken blade high--a blue, determined  figure standing before a crimson and steel assault, getting calmly  killed on a high place before the eyes of all.  He thought of the  magnificent pathos of his dead body.    These thoughts uplifted him.  He felt the quiver of war desire.  In his  ears, he heard the ring of victory.  He knew the frenzy of a rapid  successful charge.  The music of the trampling feet, the sharp voices,  the clanking arms of the column near him made him soar on the red wings  of war.  For a few moments he was sublime.    He thought that he was about to start for the front.  Indeed, he saw a  picture of himself, dust-stained, haggard, panting, flying to the front  at the proper moment to seize and throttle the dark, leering witch of  calamity.    Then the difficulties of the thing began to drag at him.  He hesitated,  balancing awkwardly on one foot.    He had no rifle; he could not fight with his hands, said he resentfully  to his plan.  Well, rifles could be had for the picking.  They were  extraordinarily profuse.    Also, he continued, it would be a miracle if he found his regiment.  Well, he could fight with any regiment.    He started forward slowly.  He stepped as if he expected to tread upon  some explosive thing.  Doubts and he were struggling.    He would truly be a worm if any of his comrades should see him  returning thus, the marks of his flight upon him.  There was a reply  that the intent fighters did not care for what happened rearward saving  that no hostile bayonets appeared there.  In the battle-blur his face  would, in a way, be hidden, like the face of a cowled man.    But then he said that his tireless fate would bring forth, when the  strife lulled for a moment, a man to ask of him an explanation.  In  imagination he felt the scrutiny of his companions as he painfully  labored through some lies.    Eventually, his courage expended itself upon these objections.  The  debates drained him of his fire.    He was not cast down by this defeat of his plan, for, upon studying the  affair carefully, he could not but admit that the objections were very  formidable.    Furthermore, various ailments had begun to cry out.  In their presence  he could not persist in flying high with the wings of war; they  rendered it almost impossible for him to see himself in a heroic light.  He tumbled headlong.    He discovered that he had a scorching thirst.  His face was so dry and  grimy that he thought he could feel his skin crackle.  Each bone of his  body had an ache in it, and seemingly threatened to break with each  movement.  His feet were like two sores.  Also, his body was calling  for food.  It was more powerful than a direct hunger.  There was a  dull, weight-like feeling in his stomach, and, when he tried to walk,  his head swayed and he tottered.  He could not see with distinctness.  Small patches of green mist floated before his vision.    While he had been tossed by many emotions, he had not been aware of  ailments.  Now they beset him and made clamor.  As he was at last  compelled to pay attention to them, his capacity for self-hate was  multiplied.  In despair, he declared that he was not like those others.  He now conceded it to be impossible that he should ever become a hero.  He was a craven loon.  Those pictures of glory were piteous things.  He  groaned from his heart and went staggering off.    A certain mothlike quality within him kept him in the vicinity of the  battle.  He had a great desire to see, and to get news.  He wished to  know who was winning.    He told himself that, despite his unprecedented suffering, he had never  lost his greed for a victory, yet, he said, in a half-apologetic manner  to his conscience, he could not but know that a defeat for the army  this time might mean many favorable things for him.  The blows of the  enemy would splinter regiments into fragments.  Thus, many men of  courage, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7300"],[0,"Woman and the Republic (#13)"],[1,"the opposite lesson from the one intended. It  could have told them that the United States Government had at least  guarded one trust with sacred care. The pauper was excluded from the  ballot as not being worthy to share with freemen the honor of its defence.  The unfortunate was excluded by an inscrutable decree of Providence. The  criminal was excluded as being dangerous to society. The women were exempt  from the ballot because it was for their special safety that a free ballot  was to be exercised, from which the pauper and the criminal must be  excluded. They were the ones who have given to social life its meaning and  its moral, the ones who give to civic life its highest value.    The authors of the \"History\" so often referred to, in answer to the claim  that \"government needs force behind it, and those who make the laws must  execute them, and a woman could not be a sheriff or policeman,\" say:  \"Woman might not fill these offices as men do, but might far more  effectively guard the morals of society and the sanitary conditions of our  cities.\" A \"moral guard\" might be an excellent thing to ward off the  ghosts in a country burying-ground, but would hardly prove effective  against the riot of a Tammany mob on the night of an exciting election. It  is absurd to speak in such fashion of work that is needed every hour. The  crust of our civilization is very thin--how thin, the nation learned  during the campaign just passed. Like a tempest from a clear sky, or one  of their own cyclones, burst an influence from a portion of the West and  South, that would have overturned the Government. Men struck fanatically  and misguidedly at the integrity of the Supreme Court, at the power of the  United States to hold jurisdiction over its own public affairs where they  conflicted with State right, at the currency that gave the country ability  to be honest at home and abroad, at the prosperity and honor of every  citizen.    Fifteen years ago Suffrage leaders wrote in view of the wonderful advance  of woman: \"The broader demand for political rights has not commanded the  thought its merits and dignity should have secured.\" If this was true, it  had not been for lack of having the demand pressed home upon Congress and  upon every State and Territorial legislature (save in most of the South),  in season and out of season, by every device known to politics, as well as  by a steady and impetuous flow of literature and petitions. How have these  bodies answered this long appeal? It would take too much time and space,  even were it of value, to follow the course of its ups and downs through  all these years, but I mention first the fact that no State in New England  has ever granted constitutional, or even municipal suffrage, although in  some of the old thirteen it could have been done by an act of the  legislature, a constitutional amendment not being needed. These are some  of the figures for the past few years:    In Vermont, in 1892, the House passed a municipal suffrage bill--yeas 149,  nays 83. In 1894 the House defeated a similar bill by a vote of 108 to  106, and refused reconsideration by a vote of 124 to 96. Thus a favorable  majority of 66 in 1892 was changed to an adverse majority of 28 in 1894.    In Massachusetts, in 1894, the House passed a municipal suffrage bill by a  vote of 119 to 107. In 1895 it defeated a similar bill, the vote standing,  yeas 97, nays 137, on the question of carrying the bill to a third  reading. In the same year an act was passed permitting all persons  qualified to vote for school committee to express their opinion at the  state election by voting \"Yes\" or \"No,\" to the question: \"Is it expedient  that municipal suffrage be granted to women?\" Not one woman in four voted  in favor of the proposition, although if suffrage has any traditionary  power outside of New York State, that power should have been felt in  Massachusetts.    In Maine, in 1893, the Senate passed a municipal suffrage bill, which was  defeated in the House. In 1895 the House passed a municipal suffrage bill,  which was defeated in the Senate.    In New Hampshire, in 1895, the House refused a third reading to a  municipal suffrage bill, by a vote of 185 to 108.    In Connecticut, in 1895, the Senate rejected a House municipal suffrage  bill, while a presidential suffrage bill did not reach a vote. And in  Rhode Island a proposition for a suffrage Constitutional amendment was  referred to the next legislature.    All these States had granted school suffrage and could grant municipal  suffrage by act of the legislature. In 1893 municipal suffrage bills were  defeated in Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Full  suffrage bills were defeated in Arizona and New Mexico. A township  suffrage bill was defeated in Illinois, a license suffrage bill in  Connecticut, and a village suffrage bill in New York. In that year, also,  the Supreme Courts gave decisions adverse to suffrage laws. In 1893 a bill  was defeated in the United States Senate which proposed to give women the  municipal vote in the Cherokee Outlet. The vote stood 40 to 9.    In Washington Territory the Legislature passed a law conferring suffrage  on woman in 1883; but this was declared invalid by the courts in 1887,  because its nature was not sufficiently defined in its title. It was re-  enacted in 1888, and again declared invalid by the United States  Territorial Court, on the ground that the Act of Congress which organized  the Territorial legislature did not empower it to extend the suffrage to  women. In 1889 the people, in forming their State constitution, decided  against suffrage.    In 1894, in the election of November 6, Kansas defeated a constitutional  amendment granting full suffrage, by a majority of 34,827.    In Iowa, in the same year, the Senate defeated a proposition to submit a  suffrage constitutional amendment to the people. In 1895, bills for full  suffrage and for municipal suffrage again failed to pass, and the question  was submitted to the people in 1896, and resulted in defeat.    In 1895, also, a township suffrage bill was twice defeated in Illinois.    In Indiana a proposition to strike the word \"male\" out of the  Constitution, was not even reported from the committee to which it was  referred.    In the same year, in Kansas, a bill passed the Senate which proposed to  confer upon nine specified women the full suffrage in response to their  petition. The Senate also passed a bill conferring upon women the vote for  presidential electors; but neither ever reached a vote in the House. In  Michigan, the same year, a proposition to submit a constitutional  amendment was defeated, and a similar resolution in Missouri was also  defeated. Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, Wisconsin, and  South Carolina also defeated propositions to submit the question to the  people in 1895.    Since January, 1897, Nova Scotia, two Territories, and ten States have  dealt with the suffrage proposal, and all but one of these have rendered  adverse decisions. In Nova Scotia an old bill was reconsidered, and a  larger majority was obtained against it. The territories are Arizona and  Oklahoma. The states in which it was defeated are Iowa, Nevada, Nebraska,  Kansas, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, and California. The last two had  given it heavy defeats but a few months previously. Indiana's Supreme  Court handed down an adverse decision. The favorable state was Washington,  where the Legislature voted to submit an amendment to the people next  year.    Certainly, the question cannot be said not to have received the attention  that any vital subject might have claimed, and the answers show that, as  comprehension of the meaning of democracy has grown, and as liberty of  thought and action for men and women has increased, the proposition to  cast an unequal burden, not upon a disfranchised class, but upon an  unfranchised sex which in every class has its own correlative and equal  duties, rights, and privileges, is losing ground.    But, it is answered, look at the suffrage triumphs in Utah State and  Idaho. Let us look at them more closely. It is my opinion that a few more  such triumphs would end in its utter overthrow. Utah introduced suffrage  by a simple legislative act. Woman suffrage was abolished in Utah  Territory by Federal statute, because it was found to be sustaining the  Mormon Church and the institution of polygamy. The Suffragists profess to  hold in abhorrence churchly and polygamous rule. Here was an opportunity  for them to say to the Government: \"This is not what we meant by suffrage,  nor what we desire suffrage to be used for. We approve this real  disfranchisement.\" Did they do anything of the kind? Far from it. In 1876  they passed the following: \"Resolved, That, the right of suffrage being  vested in the women of Utah by their constitutional and lawful  enfranchisement, and by six years of use, we denounce the proposition  about to be again presented to Congress for the disfranchisement of the  women of that Territory, as an outrage on the freedom of thousands of  legal voters and a gross innovation of vested rights; we demand the  abolition of the system of numbering the ballots, in order that the women  may be thoroughly free to vote as they choose, without supervision or  dictation; and that the chair appoint a committee of three persons, with  power to add to their number, to memorialize Congress, and otherwise watch  over the rights of women of Utah in this regard during the next  twelvemonth.\"    In 1878 the report of Utah's governor contained the following: \"All voters  must be over twenty-one years of age, and must have resided in the  Territory six months, and in the precinct one month. If males, they must  be native born or naturalized citizens of the United States, and tax-  payers in the Territory. A female voter need not be a tax-payer, and if  the wife, widow or daughter of a native or"]]]
