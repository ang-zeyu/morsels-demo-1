Her wings were quite ragged.  I imagined she had finished laying  her eggs, and was nearing the end of life, hence she was not so  brilliant as a newly  emerged specimen.  The moth proved this  theory correct by soon going out naturally.    Choice could be made in all that plethora, and a male and female of  most perfect colouring and markings were selected, for my studies of  a pair.  One male was mounted and a very large female on account of  her size.  That completed my Imperialis records from eggs to  caterpillars, pupae and moths.    The necessity for a book on this subject; made simple to the  understanding, and attractive to the eye of the masses, never was  so deeply impressed upon me as in an experience with Imperialis.  Molly-Cotton was attending a house-party, and her host had chartered  a pavilion at a city park for a summer night dance.  At the close of  one of the numbers; over the heads of the laughing crowd, there swept  toward the light a large yellow moth.    With one dexterous sweep the host caught it, and while the dancers  crowded around him with exclamations of wonder and delight, he  presented it to Molly-Cotton and asked, \"Do you know what it is?\"    She laughingly answered, \"Yes.  But you don't!\"    \"Guilty!\" he responded.  \"Name it.\"    For one fleeting instant Molly-Cotton measured the company.  There  was no one present who was not the graduate of a commissioned high  school.  There were girls who were students at The Castle, Smith,  Vassar, and Bryn Mawr.  The host was a Cornell junior, and there  were men from Harvard and Yale.    \"It is an Eacles Imperialis Io Polyphemus Cecropia Regalis,\"  she  said.  Then in breathless suspense she waited.    \"Shades of Homer!\"  cried the host.  \"Where did you learn it?\"    \"They  are flying all through the Cabin at home,\" she replied.  \"There was a tumbler turned over their eggs on the dining-room floor,  and you dared not sit on the right side of the library window seat  because of them when I left.\"    \"What do you want with their eggs?\" asked a girl.    \"Want to hatch their caterpillars, and raise them until they transform  into these moths,\"  answered poor Molly-Cotton, who had been taught  to fear so few living things that at the age of four she had carried  a garter snake into the house for a playmate.    \"Caterpillars!\"  The chorus arose to a shriek.  \"Don't they sting you?  Don't they bite you?\"    \"No, they  don't!\" replied Molly-Cotton.  \"They don't bite anything  except leaves; they are fine big fellows; their colouring is exquisite;  and they evolve these beautiful moths.  I invite all of you to visit  us, and see for yourselves how intensely interesting they are.\"    There was a murmur of polite thanks from the girls, but one man  measured Molly-Cotton from the top curl of her head to the tip of  her slippers, and answered, \"I accept the invitation.  When may  I come?\"  He came, and left as great a moth enthusiast as any of  us.  This incident will be recognized as furnishing the basis on  which to build the ballroom scene in \"A Girl of the Limberlost\",  in which Philip and Edith quarrel over the capture of a yellow  Emperor.  But what of these students from the great representative  colleges of the United States, to whom a jumbled string made from  the names, of half a dozen moths answered for one of the commonest  of all?          CHAPTER V  The Lady Bird: Deilephila Lineata      In that same country garden where my first Cecropia was found,  Deilephila Lineata was one of my earliest recollections.  This moth  flew among the flowers of especial sweetness all day long, just as  did the hummingbirds; and I was taught that it was a bird also--the  Lady Bird.  The little tan and grey thing hovering in air before the  flowers was almost as large as the humming-birds, sipping honey as  they did, swift in flight as they; and both my  parents thought  it a bird.    They did not know the humming-birds were feasting on small insects  attracted by the sweets, quite as often as on honey, for they never  had examined closely.  They had been taught, as I was, that this  other constant visitor to the flowers was a bird.  When a child,  a humming-bird nested in a honeysuckle climbing over my mother's  bedroom window.  My father lifted me, with his handkerchief bound  across my nose, on the supposition that the bird was so delicate  it would desert its nest and eggs if they were breathed upon, to  see the tiny cup of lichens, with a brown finish so fine it resembled  the lining of a chestnut burr, and two tiny  eggs.  I well remember  he told me that I now had seen the nest and eggs of the smallest  feathered creature except the Lady Bird, and he never had found  its cradle himself.    Every summer I discovered nests by the dozen, and for several  years a systematic search was made for the home of a Lady Bird.  One of the unfailing methods of finding locations was to climb a  large Bartlett pear tree that stood beside the garden fence, and  from an overhanging bough watch where birds flew with bugs and  worms they collected.  Lady Birds were spied upon, but when they  left our garden they arose high in air, and went straight from  sight toward every direction.  So locating their nests as those  of other birds were found, seemed impossible.    Then I tried going close the sweetest flowers, those oftenest  visited, the petunias, yellow day lilies, and trumpet creepers,  and sitting so immovably I was not noticeable while I made a study  of the Lady Birds.  My first discovery was that they had no tail.  One poised near enough to make sure of that, and I hurried to my  father with the startling news.  He said it was nothing remarkable;  birds frequently lost their tails.  He explained how a bird in close  quarters has power to relax its muscles, and let its tail go in  order to save its body, when under the paw of a cat, or caught in a  trap.    That was satisfactory, but I thought it must have been a spry cat  to get even a paw on the Lady  Bird, for frequently humming-birds  could be seen perching, but never one of these.  I watched the tail  question sharply, and soon learned the cats had been after every  Lady Bird that visited our garden, or any of our neighbours, for not  one of them had a tail.  When this information was carried my father,  he became serious, but finally he said perhaps the tail was very short;  those of humming-birds or wrens were, and apparently some water birds  had no tail, or at least a very short one.    That seemed plausible, but still I watched this small and most  interesting bird of all; this bird that no one ever had seen taking  a bath, or perching, and whose nest never had been found by a person  so familiar with all outdoors as my  father.  Then came a second  discovery: it could curl its beak in a little coil when leaving a flower.  A few days later I saw distinctly that it had four wings but I could  discover no feet.  I became a rank doubter, and when these convincing  proofs were carried to my father, he also grew dubious.    \"I always have thought and been taught that it was a bird,\"  he said,  \"but you see so clearly and report so accurately, you almost convince  me it is some large insect possibly of the moth family.\"    When I carried this opinion to my mother and told her, no doubt  pompously, that 'very possibly' I had discovered that the Lady  Bird was not a bird at all, she hailed it as high treason, and  said, \"Of course it is a bird!\"  That forced me to action.  The  desperate course of capturing one was resolved upon.  If only I  could, surely its feet, legs, and wings would tell if it were a  bird.  By the hour I slipped among those bloom-bordered walks  between the beds of flaming sweet-williams, buttercups, phlox,  tiger and day lilies, Job's tears, hollyhocks, petunias, poppies,  mignonette, and every dear old-fashioned flower that grows, and  followed around the flower-edged beds of lettuce, radishes,  and small vegetables, relentlessly trailing Lady Birds.    Pass after pass I made at them, but they  always dived and escaped  me.  At last, when I almost had given up the chase, one went nearly  from sight in a trumpet creeper.  With a sweep the flower was  closed behind it, and I ran into the house crying that at last I  had caught a Lady  Bird.  Holding carefully, the trumpet was cut  open with a pin, and although the moth must have been slightly  pinched, and lacking in down when released, I clung to it until  my mother and every doubting member of my family was convinced that  this was no bird at all, for it lacked beak, tail, and feathers,  while it had six legs and four wings.  Father was delighted that  I had learned something new, all by  myself; but I really think  it slightly provoked my  mother when thereafter I always refused  to call it a bird.  This certainly was reprehensible.  She should  have known all the time that it was a moth.    The other day a club woman of Chicago who never in her life has  considered money, who always has had unlimited opportunities for  culture both in America and Europe, who speaks half a dozen languages,  and has the care of but one child, came in her auto mobile to  investigate the Limberlost.  Almost her first demand was to see  pictures.  One bird study I handed her was of a brooding king rail,  over a foot tall, with a three-foot wing sweep, and a long curved  bill.  She cried, \"Oh! see the dear little hummingbird!\"    If a woman of unlimited opportunity, in this day of the world,  does not know a rail from a humming-bird, what could you expect of  my little mother, who spoke only two languages, reared twelve lusty  children, and never saw an ocean.    So by degrees the Lady Bird of the garden resolved itself into  Deilephila Lineata.

In this order, and anxiously overlooked by their comrades, whose eyes  alone peered from above the surface of the rampart on which they lay  prostrate, the detachment crossed the common; one rank headed by  Captain Erskine, the other by Lieutenant Johnstone. They had now  approached within a few yards of the unfortunate victim, when Captain  Erskine commanded a halt of his party; and two files were detached from  the rear of each rank, to place the body on a litter with which they  had provided themselves. He and Johnstone also moved in the same  direction in advance of the men, prepared to render assistance if  required. The corpse lay on its face, and in no way despoiled of any of  its glittering habiliments; a circumstance that too well confirmed the  fact of De Haldimar's death having been accomplished by the ball from  Sir Everard Valletort's rifle. It appeared, however, the ill-fated  officer had struggled much in the agonies of death; for the left leg  was drawn Up into an unnatural state of contraction, and the right  hand, closely compressed, grasped a quantity of grass and soil, which  had evidently been torn up in a paroxysm of suffering and despair.    The men placed the litter at the side of the body, which they now  proceeded to raise. As they were in the act of depositing it on this  temporary bier, the plumed hat fell from the head, and disclosed, to  the astonishment of all, the scalpless crown completely saturated in  its own clotted blood and oozing brains.    An exclamation of horror and disgust escaped at the same moment from  the lips of the two officers, and the men started back from their  charge as if a basilisk had suddenly appeared before them. Captain  Erskine pursued:--\"What the devil is the meaning of all this,  Johnstone?\"    \"What, indeed!\" rejoined his lieutenant, with a shrug of the shoulders,  that was intended to express his inability to form any opinion on the  subject.    \"Unless it should prove,\" continued Erskine, \"as I sincerely trust it  may, that poor Valletort is not, after all, the murderer of his friend.  It must be so. De Haldimar has been slain by the same Indian who killed  Murphy.--Do you recollect his scalp cry? He was in the act of  despoiling his victim of this trophy of success, when Sir Everard  fired. Examine the body well, Mitchell, and discover where the wound  lies.\"    The old soldier to whom this order was addressed now prepared, with the  assistance of his comrades, to turn the body upon its back, when  suddenly the air was rent with terrific yells, that seemed to be  uttered in their very ears, and in the next instant more than a hundred  dark and hideous savages sprang simultaneously to their feet within the  bomb-proof, while every tree along the skirt of the forest gave back  the towering form of a warrior. Each of these, in addition to his  rifle, was armed with all those destructive implements of warfare which  render the Indians of America so formidable and so terrible an enemy.    \"Stand to your arms, men,\" shouted Captain Erskine, recovering from his  first and unavoidable, though but momentary, surprise. \"First and  fourth sections, on your right and left backwards wheel:--Quick, men,  within the square, for your lives.\" As he spoke, he and Lieutenant  Johnstone sprang hastily back, and in time to obtain admittance within  the troops, who had rapidly executed the manoeuvre commanded. Not so  with Mitchell and his companions. On the first alarm they had quitted  the body of the mutilated officer, and flown to secure their arms, but  even while in the act of stooping to take them up, they had been  grappled by a powerful and vindictive foe; and the first thing they  beheld on regaining their upright position was a dusky Indian at the  side, and a gleaming tomahawk flashing rapidly round the head of each.    \"Fire not, on your lives,\" exclaimed Captain Erskine hastily, as he saw  several of the men in front levelling, in the excitement of the moment,  their muskets at the threatening savages. \"Prepare for attack,\" he  pursued; and in the next instant each man dropped on his right knee,  and a barrier of bristling bayonets seemed to rise from the very bowels  of the earth. Attracted by the novelty of the sight, the bold and  daring warriors, although still retaining their firm grasp of the  unhappy soldiers, were for a moment diverted from their bloody purpose,  and temporarily suspended the quick and rotatory motion of their  weapons. Captain Erskine took advantage of this pause to seize the  halbert of one of his sergeants, to the extreme point of which he  hastily attached a white pocket handkerchief, that was loosely thrust  into the breast of his uniform; this he waved on high three several  times, and then relinquishing the halbert, dropped also on his knee  within the square.    \"The dog of a Saganaw asks for mercy,\" said a voice from within the  bomb-proof, and speaking in the dialect of the Ottawas. \"His pale flag  bespeaks the quailing of his heart, and his attitude denotes the  timidity of the hind. His warriors are like himself, and even now upon  their knees they call upon their Manitou to preserve them from the  vengeance of the red-skins. But mercy is not for dogs like these. Now  is the time to make our tomahawks warm in their blood; and every head  that we count shall be a scalp upon our war poles.\"    As he ceased, one universal and portentous yell burst from the  fiend-like band; and again the weapons of death were fiercely  brandished around the heads of the stupified soldiers who had fallen  into their power.    \"What can they be about?\" anxiously exclaimed Captain Erskine, in the  midst of this deafening clamour, to his subaltern.--\"Quiet, man; damn  you, quiet, or I'll cut you down,\" he pursued, addressing one of his  soldiers, whose impatience caused him to bring his musket half up to  the shoulder. And again he turned his head in the direction of the  fort:--\"Thank God, here it comes at last,--I feared my signal had not  been noticed.\"    While he yet spoke, the loud roaring of a cannon from the ramparts was  heard, and a shower of grape-shot passed over the heads of the  detachment, and was seen tearing up the earth around the bomb-proof,  and scattering fragments of stone and wood into the air. The men  simultaneously and unbidden gave three cheers.    In an instant the scene was changed. As if moved by some mechanical  impulse, the fierce band that lined the bomb-proof sank below the  surface, and were no longer visible, while the warriors in the forest  again sought shelter behind the trees. The captured soldiers were also  liberated without injury, so sudden and startling had been the terror  produced in the savages by the lightning flash that announced its heavy  messengers of destruction. Discharge after discharge succeeded without  intermission; but the guns had been levelled so high, to prevent injury  to their own men, they had little other effect than to keep the Indians  from the attack. The rush of bullets through the close forest, and the  crashing of trees and branches as they fell with startling force upon  each other, were, with the peals of artillery, the only noises now to  be heard; for not a yell, not a word was uttered by the Indians after  the first discharge; and but for the certainty that existed in every  mind, it might have been supposed the whole of them had retired.    \"Now is your time,\" cried Captain Erskine; \"bring in the litter to the  rear, and stoop as much as possible to avoid the shot.\"    The poor half-strangled fellows, however, instead of obeying the order  of their captain, looked round in every direction for the enemy by whom  they had been so rudely handled, and who had glided from them almost as  imperceptibly and swiftly as they had first approached. It seemed as if  they apprehended that any attempt to remove the body would be visited  by those fierce devils with the same appalling and ferocious  threatenings.    \"Why stand ye there, ye dolts,\" continued their captain, \"looking  around as if ye were bewitched? Bring the litter in to the  rear.--Mitchell, you old fool, are you grown a coward in your age? Are  you not ashamed to set such an example to your comrades?\"    The doubt thus implied of the courage of his men, who, in fact, were  merely stupified with the scene they had gone through, had, as Captain  Erskine expected, the desired effect. They now bent themselves to the  litter, on which they had previously deposited their muskets, and with  a self-possession that contrasted singularly with their recent air of  wild astonishment, bore it to the rear at the risk of being cut in two  at every moment by the fire from the fort.    One fierce yell, instinctively proffered by several of the lurking band  in the forest, marked their disappointment and rage at the escape of  their victims; but all attempt at uncovering themselves, so as to be  enabled to fire, was prevented by the additional showers of grape which  that yell immediately brought upon them.    The position in which Captain Erskine now found himself was highly  critical. Before him, and on either flank, was a multitude of savages,  who only awaited the cessation of the fire from the fort to commence  their fierce and impetuous attack. That that fire could not long be  sustained was evident, since ammunition could ill be spared for the  present inefficient purpose, where supplies of all kinds were so  difficult to be obtained; and, if he should attempt a retreat, the  upright position of his men exposed them to the risk of being swept  away by the ponderous metal, that"]]]
