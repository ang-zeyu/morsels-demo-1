The day  after to-morrow I shall start for Italy, and you will accompany me  as my servant.\"    \"Wanda--\"    \"I forbid any sort of familiarity,\" she said, cutting my words short,  \"likewise you are not to come in unless I call or ring for you, and  you are not to speak to me until you are spoken to. From now on your  name is no longer Severin, but _Gregor_.\"    I trembled with rage, and yet, unfortunately, I cannot deny it, I  also felt a strange pleasure and stimulation.    \"But, madame, you know my circumstances,\" I began in my confusion.  \"I am dependent on my father, and I doubt whether he will give me the  large sum of money needed for this journey--\"    \"That means you have no money, Gregor,\" said Wanda, delightedly, \"so  much the better, you are then entirely dependent on me, and in fact  my slave.\"    \"You don't consider,\" I tried to object, \"that as man of honor it is  impossible for me--\"    \"I have indeed considered it,\" she replied almost with a tone of  command. \"As a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your  promise to follow me as slave whithersoever I demand and to obey  whatever I command. Now leave me, Gregor!\"    I turned toward the door.    \"Not yet--you may first kiss my hand.\" She held it out to me with a  certain proud indifference, and I the dilettante, the donkey, the  miserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips  which were dry and hot with excitement.    There was another gracious nod of the head.    Then I was dismissed.           *       *       *       *       *    Though it was late in the evening my light was still lit, and a fire  was burning in the large green stove. There were still many things  among my letters and documents to be put in order. Autumn, as is  usually the case with us, had fallen with all its power.    Suddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip.    I opened and saw her standing outside in her ermine-lined jacket and  in a high round Cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great  Catherine favored.    \"Are you ready, Gregor?\" she asked darkly.    \"Not yet, mistress,\" I replied.    \"I like that word,\" she said then, \"you are always to call me  mistress, do you understand? We leave here to-morrow morning at nine  o'clock. As far as the district capital you will be my companion and  friend, but from the moment that we enter the railway-coach you are  my slave, my servant. Now close the window, and open the door.\"    After I had done as she had demanded, and after she had entered, she  asked, contracting her brows ironically, \"well, how do you like me.\"    \"Wanda, you--\"    \"Who gave you permission?\" She gave me a blow with the whip.    \"You are very beautiful, mistress.\"    Wanda smiled and sat down in the arm-chair. \"Kneel down--here beside  my chair.\"    I obeyed.    \"Kiss my hand.\"    I seized her small cold hand and kissed it.    \"And the mouth--\"    In a surge of passion I threw my arms around the beautiful cruel  woman, and covered her face, arms, and breast with glowing kisses.  She returned them with equal fervor--the eyelids closed as in a  dream. It was after midnight when she left.           *       *       *       *       *    At nine o'clock sharp in the morning everything was ready for departure,  as she had ordered. We left the little Carpathian health-resort in a  comfortable light carriage. The most interesting drama of my life had  reached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossible  to foretell.    So far everything went well. I sat beside Wanda, and she chatted  very graciously and intelligently with me, as with a good friend,  concerning Italy, Pisemski's new novel, and Wagner's music. She wore  a sort of Amazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short  jacket of the same material, set with dark fur. It fitted closely and  showed her figure to best advantage. Over it she wore dark furs. Her  hair wound into an antique knot, lay beneath a small dark fur-hat  from which a black veil hung. Wanda was in very good humor; she fed  me candies, played with my hair, loosened my neck cloth and made a  pretty cockade of it; she covered my knees with her furs and  stealthily pressed the fingers of my hand. When our Jewish driver  persistently went on nodding to himself, she even gave me a kiss, and  her cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnal  rose, which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves and  upon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice.           *       *       *       *       *    We are at the district capital. We get out at the railway station.  Wanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm, and goes  to secure the tickets.    When she returns she has completely changed.    \"Here is your ticket, Gregor,\" she says in a tone which supercilious  ladies use to their servants.    \"A third-class ticket,\" I reply with comic horror.    \"Of course,\" she continues, \"but now be careful. You won't get on  until I am settled in my compartment and don't need you any longer.  At each station you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders. Don't  forget. And now give me my furs.\"    After I had helped her into them, humbly like a slave, she went to  find an empty first-class coupe. I followed. Supporting herself on  my shoulder, she got on and I wrapped her feet in bear-skins and placed  them on the warming bottle.    Then she nodded to me, and dismissed me. I slowly ascended a third-class  carriage, which was filled with abominable tobacco-smoke that seemed  like the fogs of Acheron at the entrance to Hades. I now had the leisure  to muse about the riddle of human existence, and about its greatest  riddle of all--_woman_.           *       *       *       *       *    Whenever the train stops, I jump off, run to her carriage, and with  drawn cap await her orders. She wants coffee and then a glass of  water, at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands, and  thus it goes on. She lets several men who have entered her  compartment pay court to her. I am dying of jealousy and have to leap  about like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and  not miss the train.    In this way the night passes. I haven't had time to eat a mouthful  and I can't sleep, I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish  peasants, Jewish peddlers, and common soldiers.    When I mount the steps of her coupe, she is lying stretched out  on cushions in her comfortable furs, covered up with the skins of  animals. She is like an oriental despot, and the men sit like Indian  deities, straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to  breathe.           *       *       *       *       *    She stops over in Vienna for a day to go shopping, and particularly  to buy series of luxurious gowns. She continues to treat me as her  servant. I follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces. She  hands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look,  and laden down like a donkey I pant along behind.    Before leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel  waiters. I am ordered to put on her livery. It is a Cracovian costume  in her colors, light-blue with red facings, and red quadrangular cap,  ornamented with peacock-feathers. The costume is rather becoming to  me.    The silver buttons bear her coat of arms. I have the feeling of having  been sold or of having bonded myself to the devil. My fair demon leads  me from Vienna to Florence. Instead of linen-garbed Mazovians and  greasy-haired Jews, my companions now are curly-haired Contadini, a  magnificent sergeant of the first Italian Grenadiers, and a poor German  painter. The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions, but of salami and  cheese.    Night has fallen again. I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack; my arms and  legs seem broken. But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the  affair. The stars sparkle round about, the Italian sergeant has a face  like Apollo Belvedere, and the German painter sings a lovely German  song.      \"Now that all the shadows gather    And endless stars grow light,    Deep yearning on me falls    And softly fills the night.\"      \"Through the sea of dreams    Sailing without cease,    Sailing goes my soul    In thine to find release.\"    And I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal  comfort among her soft furs.           *       *       *       *       *    Florence! Crowds, cries, importunate porters and cab-drivers. Wanda  chooses a carriage, and dismisses the porters.    \"What have I a servant for,\" she says, \"Gregor--here is the ticket--  get the luggage.\"    She wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I  drag the heavy trunks hither, one after another. I break down for a  moment under the last one; a good-natured _carabiniere_ with an  intelligent face comes to my assistance. She laughs.    \"It must be heavy,\" said she, \"all my furs are in it.\"    I get up on the driver's seat, wiping drops of perspiration from my  brow. She gives the name of the hotel, and the driver urges on his  horse. In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated  entrance.    \"Have you any rooms?\" she asks the portier.    \"Yes, madame.\"    \"Two for me, one for my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#13)"],[1,"goals. But, with the exception of  Fenn, who stood brooding by himself in the centre of the field,  wrapped to the eyes in a huge overcoat, and two other house prefects  of Kay's, who strolled up and down looking as if they wished they were  in their studies, there was no sign of the missing team.    \"I can't make it out,\" said Kennedy.    \"You're sure you put up the right time?\" asked Jimmy Silver.    \"Yes, quite.\"    It certainly could not be said that Kay's had had any room for doubt  as to the time of the match, for it had appeared in large figures on  both notices.    A quarter to five sounded from the college clock.    \"We must begin soon,\" said Mr Blackburn, \"or there will not be light  enough even for two twenty-fives.\"    Kennedy felt wretched. Apart from the fact that he was frozen to an  icicle and drenched by the rain, he felt responsible for his team, and  he could see that Blackburn's men were growing irritated at the delay,  though they did their best to conceal it.    \"Can't we lend them some subs?\" suggested Challis, hopefully.    \"All right--if you can raise eleven subs,\" said Silver. \"They've only  got four men on the field at present.\"    Challis subsided.    \"Look here,\" said Kennedy, \"I'm going back to the house to see what's  up. I'll be back as soon as I can. They must have mistaken the time or  something after all.\"    He rushed back to the house, and flung open the door of the senior  dayroom. It was empty.    Kennedy had expected to find his missing men huddled in a semicircle  round the fire, waiting for some one to come and tell them that  Blackburn's had taken the field, and that they could come out now  without any fear of having to wait in the rain for the match to begin.  This, he thought, would have been the unselfish policy of Kay's senior  dayroom.    But to find nobody was extraordinary.    The thought occurred to him that the team might be changing in their  dormitories. He ran upstairs. But all the dormitories were locked, as  he might have known they would have been. Coming downstairs again he  met his fag, Spencer.    Spencer replied to his inquiry that he had only just come in. He did  not know where the team had got to. No, he had not seen any of them.    \"Oh, yes, though,\" he added, as an afterthought, \"I met Walton just  now. He looked as if he was going down town.\"    Walton had once licked Spencer, and that vindictive youth thought that  this might be a chance of getting back at him.    \"Oh,\" said Kennedy, quietly, \"Walton? Did you? Thanks.\"    Spencer was disappointed at his lack of excitement. His news did not  seem to interest him.    Kennedy went back to the football field to inform Jimmy Silver of the  result of his investigations.          XII    KENNEDY INTERVIEWS WALTON      \"I'm very sorry,\" he said, when he rejoined the shivering group, \"but  I'm afraid we shall have to call this match off. There seems to have  been a mistake. None of my team are anywhere about. I'm awfully sorry,  sir,\" he added, to Mr Blackburn, \"to have given you all this trouble  for nothing.\"    \"Not at all, Kennedy. We must try another day.\"    Mr Blackburn suspected that something untoward had happened in Kay's  to cause this sudden defection of the first fifteen of the house. He  knew that Kennedy was having a hard time in his new position, and he  did not wish to add to his discomfort by calling for an explanation  before an audience. It could not be pleasant for Kennedy to feel that  his enemies had scored off him. It was best to preserve a discreet  silence with regard to the whole affair, and leave him to settle it  for himself.    Jimmy Silver was more curious. He took Kennedy off to tea in his  study, sat him down in the best chair in front of the fire, and  proceeded to urge him to confess everything.    \"Now, then, what's it all about?\" he asked, briskly, spearing a muffin  on the fork and beginning to toast.    \"It's no good asking me,\" said Kennedy. \"I suppose it's a put-up job  to make me look a fool. I ought to have known something of this kind  would happen when I saw what they did to my first notice.\"    \"What was that?\"    Kennedy explained.    \"This is getting thrilling,\" said Jimmy. \"Just pass that plate.  Thanks. What are you going to do about it?\"    \"I don't know. What would you do?\"    \"My dear chap, I'd first find out who was at the bottom of it--there's  bound to be one man who started the whole thing--and I'd make it my  aim in life to give him the warmest ten minutes he'd ever had.\"    \"That sounds all right. But how would you set about it?\"    \"Why, touch him up, of course. What else would you do? Before the  whole house, too.\"    \"Supposing he wouldn't be touched up?\"    \"Wouldn't _be!_ He'd have to.\"    \"You don't know Kay's, Jimmy. You're thinking what you'd do if this  had happened in Blackburn's. The two things aren't the same. Here the  man would probably take it like a lamb. The feeling of the house would  be against him. He'd find nobody to back him up. That's because  Blackburn's is a decent house instead of being a sink like Kay's. If I  tried the touching-up before the whole house game with our chaps, the  man would probably reply by going for me, assisted by the whole  strength of the company.\"    \"Well, dash it all then, all you've got to do is to call a prefects'  meeting, and he'll get ten times worse beans from them than he'd have  got from you. It's simple.\"    Kennedy stared into the fire pensively.    \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I bar that prefects' meeting business. It  always seems rather feeble to me, lugging in a lot of chaps to help  settle some one you can't manage yourself. I want to carry this job  through on my own.\"    \"Then you'd better scrap with the man.\"    \"I think I will.\"    Silver stared.    \"Don't be an ass,\" he said. \"I was only rotting. You  can't go fighting all over the shop as if you were a fag. You'd lose  your prefect's cap if it came out.\"    \"I could wear my topper,\" said Kennedy, with a grin. \"You see,\" he  added, \"I've not much choice. I must do something. If I took no notice  of this business there'd be no holding the house. I should be ragged to  death. It's no good talking about it. Personally, I should prefer  touching the chap up to fighting him, and I shall try it on. But he's  not likely to meet me half-way. And if he doesn't there'll be an  interesting turn-up, and you shall hold the watch. I'll send a kid  round to fetch you when things look like starting. I must go now to  interview my missing men. So long. Mind you slip round directly I send  for you.\"    \"Wait a second. Don't be in such a beastly hurry. Who's the chap  you're going to fight?\"    \"I don't know yet. Walton, I should think. But I don't know.\"    \"Walton! By Jove, it'll be worth seeing, anyhow, if we _are_ both  sacked for it when the Old Man finds out.\"    Kennedy returned to his study and changed his football boots for a  pair of gymnasium shoes. For the job he had in hand it was necessary  that he should move quickly, and football boots are a nuisance on a  board floor. When he had changed, he called Spencer.    \"Go down to the senior dayroom,\" he said, \"and tell MacPherson I want  to see him.\"    MacPherson was a long, weak-looking youth. He had been put down to  play for the house that day, and had not appeared.    \"MacPherson!\" said the fag, in a tone of astonishment, \"not Walton?\"    He had been looking forward to the meeting between Kennedy and his  ancient foe, and to have a miserable being like MacPherson offered as  a substitute disgusted him.    \"If you have no objection,\" said Kennedy, politely, \"I may want you to  fetch Walton later on.\"    Spencer vanished, hopeful once more.    \"Come in, MacPherson,\" said Kennedy, on the arrival of the long one;  \"shut the door.\"    MacPherson did so, feeling as if he were paying a visit to the  dentist. As long as there had been others with him in this affair he  had looked on it as a splendid idea. But to be singled out like this  was quite a different thing.    \"Now,\" said Kennedy, \"Why weren't you on the field this afternoon?\"    \"I--er--I was kept in.\"    \"How long?\"    \"Oh--er--till about five.\"    \"What do you call about five?\"    \"About twenty-five to,\" he replied, despondently.    \"Now look here,\" said Kennedy, briskly, \"I'm just going to explain to  you exactly how I stand in this business, so you'd better attend. I  didn't ask to be made head of this sewage depot. If I could have had  any choice, I wouldn't have touched a Kayite with a barge-pole. But  since I am head, I'm going to be it, and the sooner you and your  senior dayroom crew realise it the better. This sort of thing isn't  going on. I want to know now who it was put up this job. You wouldn't  have the cheek to start a thing like this yourself. Who was it?\"    \"Well--er--\"    \"You'd better say, and be quick, too. I can't wait. Whoever it was. I  shan't tell him you told me. And I shan't tell Kay. So now you can go  ahead. Who was it?\"    \"Well--er--Walton.\"    \"I thought so. Now you can get out. If you see Spencer, send him here.\"    Spencer, curiously enough, was just outside the door. So close to it,  indeed, that he almost tumbled in when MacPherson opened it.    \"Go and fetch Walton,\" said Kennedy.    Spencer dashed off delightedly, and in a couple of minutes Walton  appeared. He walked in with an air of subdued defiance, and slammed  the door.    \"Don't bang the door like that,\" said Kennedy. \"Why didn't you turn  out today?\"    \"I was kept in.\"    \"Couldn't you get out in time to play?\"    \"No.\"    \"When did you get out?\"    \"Six.\"    \"Not before?\"    \"I said six.\"    \"Then how did you manage to go down town--without leave, by the way,  but that's a detail--at half-past five?\"    \"All right,\" said Walton; \"better call me a liar.\"    \"Good suggestion,\" said Kennedy, cheerfully; \"I will.\"    \"It's all very well,\" said Walton. \"You know jolly well you can say  anything you like. I can't do anything "]]]
