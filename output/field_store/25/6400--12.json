The next conference was appointed to be held on the sixth day of      April next.    _Tuesday, 8_.--After conference, this week I was mostly engaged in  attending to the general affairs of the Church, and principally about  home.    _Friday, 11_.--This evening, Elders Young, Kimball, George A. Smith,  Hedlock, and Turley started from Springfield, traveled eight miles on  their journey, and stayed with Father Draper.    _Saturday, 12_.--The Elders of the British Mission left Father Draper's  and pursued their journey toward Terre Haute.    [Sidenote: Death of John Young, Brigham Young's Father.]    This day President Brigham Young's father, John Young, Sen., died at  Quincy, Adams County, Illinois. He was in his seventy-seventh year,  and a soldier of the Revolution. He was also a firm believer in the  everlasting Gospel of Jesus Christ; and fell asleep under the influence  of that faith that buoyed up his soul, in the pangs of death, to  a glorious hope of immortality; fully testifying to all, that the  religion he enjoyed in life was able to {15} support him in death. He  was driven from Missouri with the Saints in the latter part of last  year. He died a martyr to the religion of Jesus, for his death was  caused by his sufferings in the cruel persecution.    _Sunday, 13_.--I attended meeting in the grove. The assembly was small  on account of the cold weather.    _Tuesday, 15_.--In the afternoon I went to Quincy in company with  Brother Hyrum Smith, John S. Fullmer, and Bishop Knight. Quite a number  of families moving into Commerce.    _Thursday, 17_.--The brethren arrived at Terre Haute. Brothers Smith,  Hedlock, and Turley stopped at Brother Nahum Milton Stow's.    [Sidenote: Hardships of the Elders of the British Mission.]    In the evening Doctor Modisett went down to see the brethren, and  appeared to be very much affected to see them so sick, and having to  lie upon the floor on a straw bed that had been put into the wagon at  Springfield, by the brethren, for Elder Young to lie on, as he was  not able to sit up when he left there. When the doctor returned home,  he told Elders Young and Kimball, he could not refrain from shedding  tears to see the brethren going upon such a long mission, and in such  suffering circumstances. Elders Young and Kimball said they thought  the doctor might have relieved them from \"their suffering and indigent  circumstances upon their long mission,\" for he told them in the course  of the evening, that his taxes in that place amounted to over four  hundred dollars, besides having other property to a great amount.    Elder Kimball was very sick; he stopped with Brother Young at Doctor  Modisett's. In the evening Doctor Modisett gave Elder Kimball about  forty drops of morphine, saying it would relieve him of his distress,  and probably he would get a nap. In about fifteen minutes Brother  Kimball complained of feeling very strange; he rose from his seat and  would have fallen, but Brother Young caught him and gently eased him  to the floor, where he {16} lay for some time; and it was by faith and  the close attention of Brother Young and the family that his life was  preserved through the night.    _Friday, 18_.--Brothers Smith, Hedlock, and Turley went on their  journey.    _Saturday, 19_.--The High Council appointed for the Stake of the Church  in Iowa, met at Asahel Smith's, Nashville, and organized; John Smith,  President; Elias Smith, Clerk; Reynolds Cahoon and Lyman Wight were  chosen Counselors to President John Smith, and approved by the Council.  Council organized according to number. [9]        _Minutes of the Nauvoo High Council, 20th October, 1839_.

Sherwood, Clerk.    _Tuesday, 22_.--Brother James Modisett took Elders Young and Kimball  in his father's carriage and carried them twenty miles to the house of  Brother Addison Pratt; from thence they were carried by Elder Almon W.  Babbitt to Pleasant Garden, and put up with Brother Jonathan Crosby.  Elder Almon Babbitt was preaching in that region with good success; he  had baptized five.    _Saturday, 26_.--Brother Babbitt took Elders Young and Kimball ten  miles on their way to Father Scott's.    King Follett, the last of the brethren in bonds in Missouri, had his  trial and was set free some time previous to this day.    _Sunday, 27_.--John Scott took Elders Young and Kimball on their way  fifteen miles, some part of it in the rain; they were yet very feeble,  and put up at a tavern in Belville, and when the stage coach came  along, took passage, and rode night and day to Willowby, near Kirtland.

After being  confined to his house several days, and while meditating upon his  situation, he had a great desire to attend to the duties of his office.  On the morning of the 22nd of July, 1839, he arose from his bed and  commenced to administer to the sick in his own house and door-yard, and  he commanded them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to arise and be  made whole; and the sick were healed upon every side of him.    \"Many lay sick along the bank of the river; Joseph walked along up to  the lower stone house, occupied by Sidney Rigdon, and he healed all the  sick that lay in his path. Among the number was Henry G. Sherwood, who  was nigh unto death. Joseph stood in the door of his tent and commanded  him in the name of Jesus Christ to arise and come out of his tent, and  he obeyed him and was healed. Brother Benjamin Brown and his family  also lay sick, the former appearing to be in a dying condition. Joseph  healed them in the name of the Lord. After healing all that lay sick  upon the bank of the river as far as the stone house, he called upon  Elder Kimball and some others to accompany him across the river to  visit the sick at Montrose.

You are aware,      sir, in some measure of the embarrassment under which we have      labored through the influence of mobs and designing men, and the      disadvantageous circumstances under which we have been compelled to      contract debts in order to our existence, both as individuals and      as a society, and it is on account of this as well as a pressure      on us for debts absolutely unjust in themselves, that we have been      compelled to resort to the course we have [taken] to make a general      settlement, and this we deferred to the last moment, hoping that      something would turn in our favor, so that we might be saved the      painful necessity of resorting to such measures, to accomplish      which, justice demanded a very different course from those who are      justly our debtors, but demanded in vain.        We have been compelled to the course we have pursued, and you are      aware, sir, that all have to fare alike in such cases. But, sir,      you have one, yea, two things to comfort you; our faith, intention      and good feeling remain the same to all our creditors, and to none      more than yourself; and secondly, there is property sufficient in      the inventory to pay every debt, and some to spare, according to      the testimony of our solicitors, and the good judgment of others;      and if the court will allow us some one for assignee, who will do      justice to the cause, we confidently believe that yourself and all      others will get their compensation in full, and we have enough      left for one loaf more for each of our families. Yes, and I have      no doubt you will yet, and in a short time, be enabled to have      your pay in full, in the way I have before proposed, or some other      equally advantageous, but money is out of sight, it might as well      be out of mind, for it cannot be had.        Rest assured, dear sir, that no influence or exertion I can yet      make shall be wanting to give you satisfaction, and liquidate your      claims, but for a little season you are aware that all proceedings      are staid; but I will seek the earliest moment to acquaint you with      anything new in this matter.        I remain, sir, with sentiments of respect, your friend and      well-wisher,        JOSEPH SMITH.    {8}[Sidenote: Interview With Sidney Rigdon.]    In the evening I walked with Elder Richards to the post office, and  had an interview with Elder Rigdon, concerning certain evil reports  put in circulation by Francis M. Higbee, about some of Elder Rigdon's  family, and others; much apparent satisfaction was manifested at the  conversation, by Elder Rigdon; and Elder Richards returned with me to  my house.    [Sidenote: Moral Improvement of Nauvoo.]    _Saturday, 14_.--I attended city council in the morning, and advocated  strongly the necessity of some active measures being taken to suppress  houses and acts of infamy in the city; for the protection of the  innocent and virtuous, and the good of public morals; showing clearly  that there were certain characters in the place, who were disposed  to corrupt the morals and chastity of our citizens, and that houses  of infamy did exist, upon which a city ordinance concerning brothels  and disorderly characters was passed, to prohibit such things. It was  published in this day's _Wasp_.    I also spoke at length for the repeal of the ordinance of the city  licensing merchants, hawkers, taverns, and ordinaries, desiring that  this might be a free people, and enjoy equal rights and privileges, and  the ordinances were repealed.    After council, I worked in my garden, walked out in the city, and  borrowed two sovereigns to make a payment.    Brother Amos Fielding arrived from Liverpool.    It was reported in Nauvoo, that ex-Governor Boggs of Missouri had been  shot.    [Sidenote: Branch Organization for Philadelphia Authorized.]    I granted the petition of J. B. Nicholson, and about seventy other  members of the Church in Philadelphia, for the organization of a branch  of the Church in the north part of the city, dated April 22nd, and my  doings were sanctioned by the Twelve, who at the same time silenced {9}  Elder Benjamin Winchester for not following counsel.    _Sunday, 15_.--Attended meeting at the stand.    News of the attempted assassination of Governor Boggs was confirmed by  general report, and was mentioned on the stand.
