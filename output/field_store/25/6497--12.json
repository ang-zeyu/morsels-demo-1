It was in  this system that their federal union differed from the frequent and  transitory confederacies common among the Indian tribes. In general,  among nearly all the tribes, the rank of a chief was personal. It was  gained by the character and achievements of the individual, and it died  with him. Hence their government and policy, so far as they can be said  to have had any, were always uncertain and fluctuating. No person  understood the Indian usages better than Zeisberger. His biographer has  well described the difference which existed in this respect between the  Iroquois and their neighbors. \"The Algonkins,\" he writes, \"knew nothing  of regular government. They had no system of polity; there was no unity  of action among them. The affairs even of a single tribe were managed in  the loosest manner.\" After briefly, but accurately, delineating the  Iroquois system of councils, he adds: \"Thus they became both a political  and a military power among the aborigines; the influence of their league  was felt everywhere, and their conquests extended in every direction.\"  [Footnote: De Schweinitz: _Life of Zeisberger_, p. 39.] The principle  that \"the chief dies but the office survives,\"--the regular transmission  of rank, title and authority, by a method partly hereditary and partly  elective,--was the principle on which the life and strength of the  Iroquois constitution depended.    Next followed a provision of hardly less importance. The wars among the  Indian tribes arise almost always from individual murders. The killing  of a tribesman by the members of another community concerns his whole  people. If satisfaction is not promptly made, war follows, as a matter  of course. [Footnote: _Relation, of_ 1636, p. 119. \"C'est de la que  naissent les guerres, et c'est un sujet plus que suffisant de prendre  les armes contre quelque Village quand il refuse de satisfaire par les  presents ordonnez, pour celuy qui vous aurait tue quelq'un des  vostres.\"--_Brebeuf, on the Hurons_.] The founders of the Iroquois  commonwealth decreed that wars for this cause should not be allowed to  rise between any of their cantons. On this point a special charge was  given to the members of the Great Council. They were enjoined (in the  figurative language employed throughout the Book) not to allow the  murder to be discussed in a national assembly, where the exasperation of  the young men might lead to mischief, but to reserve it for their own  consideration; and they were required as soon as possible to bury all  animosities that might arise from it. The figure employed is impressive.  They were to uproot a huge pine-tree--the well-known emblem of their  League--disclosing a deep cavity, below which an underground stream  would be swiftly flowing. Into this current they were to cast the cause  of trouble, and then, replacing the tree, hide the mischief forever from  their people.    How strictly in spirit these injunctions were followed, and with what  good effect, their whole history shows. A notable instance of the  readiness and ingenuity of their statesmen in finding the means of  public reconciliation in such cases is given in the Jesuit narrative. On  the 24th of July, 1657, a great council was held at Onondaga to consider  three matters, all of special import. First in order was the necessity  of appeasing a threatened quarrel between two of the leading nations,  the Senecas and the Caniengas, caused by a misadventure in which a  Seneca \"captain\" had been killed by some warriors of the eastern nation.  Next in importance was the reception of a large party of Frenchmen,  headed by Father Francis le Mercier, the Superior of the Jesuit  missionaries in Canada, who had come to form a settlement among the  Iroquois. And, finally, they had to prepare the plan and the means for  an expedition against some hostile tribes. Before the meeting of the  Council the Frenchmen had paid a formal visit to the Seneca delegates,  whom they found \"filling the air with songs of mourning\" for their  slaughtered chief, and had manifested their sympathy by a present, \"to  alleviate the grief\" of the mourners. This incident seems to have  suggested to the assembled councillors a method of effecting--or at  least of announcing--the desired accommodation, and of paying at the  same time a happy compliment to their reverend visitors. By common  consent the affair was referred to the arbitrament of the Father  Superior, by whom the difference was promptly settled. [Footnote: On  the: Grand conseil le 24 du mois de Juillet, ou toutes les Nations  remisent entre les mains d'Achiendase qui est nostre Pere Superieur le  diffrend Centre les Sonnontoueeronnons et les Agnieronnons, qui fait bien  et termine.--_Relation of_ 1657, p. 16.] It was not necessary for the  politic senators to inform their gratified visitors that the performance  in which they thus took part was merely a formality which ratified, or  rather proclaimed, a foregone conclusion. The reconciliation which was  prescribed by their constitution had undoubtedly been arranged by  previous conferences, after their custom in such matters, before the  meeting of the Council. [Footnote: For a curious instance of the manner  in which questions to be apparently decided by a Council were previously  settled between the parties, see the _Life of Zeisberger_, p. 190:  \"Gietterowane was the speaker on one side, Zeisberger on the other.  These two consulted together privately,--Zeisberger unfolding the import  of the strings [of wampum which he had brought as ambassador] and  Gietterowane committing to memory what he said.\"] So effective was this  provision of their constitution that for more than three centuries this  main cause of Indian wars was rendered innocuous, and the \"Great Peace\"  remained undisturbed. This proud averment of their annalists, confirmed  as it is for more than half the period by the evidence of their white  neighbors, cannot reasonably be questioned. What nation or confederacy  of civilized Europe can show an exemption from domestic strife for so  long a term?    The third rule or ordinance which the founders enacted \"to strengthen  the house\" is of a remarkable character. It relates to the mortuary  usages of the people; and when these are understood, the great  importance of this law becomes apparent. Among the Indians of the  Huron-Iroquois family the ordinary mourning for the dead became  exaggerated into customs of the most extravagant character, exhausting  the time and strength of the warriors, and devouring their substance.  The French missionaries have left us an account of these singular usages  among the Hurons, some of which excited their respect, and others their  astonishment. \"Our savages,\" they wrote, \"are in no way savage as  regards the duties which nature herself requires us to render to the  dead. You would say that their efforts, their toils and their commerce  had no other end than to amass the means of honoring the departed. They  have nothing too precious for this object. To this they devote their  robes of skins, their hatchets and wampum, in such profusion that you  would fancy they made nothing of them; and yet these are the riches of  their country. Often in midwinter you will see them going almost naked,  while they have at home, laid up in store, good and handsome robes,  which they keep in reverence for the dead. This is their point of honor.  In this, above all, they seek to show themselves magnificent.\"  [Footnote: Brebeuf, _Relation of_ 1636, p. 128.]    During the three days that preceded the burial of the dead, or the  removal of his remains to the scaffold, the wails, groans and  lamentations of the relatives and neighbors resounded in the cabin where  he lay. All the stored riches were brought forth and lavished in gifts  \"to comfort the mourners.\" The mourning did not end with the burial; in  fact, it may be said to have then only begun. The \"great mourning,\" as  the missionaries term it, lasted for six days longer, during which the  mourners lay, face downward, upon their mats, and enveloped in their  robes, speechless, or replying only by an ejaculation to those who  addressed them. During this period they had no fire in the house, even  in winter; they ate their food cold, and left the cabin only at night,  and as secretly as possible. The \"lesser mourning\" lasted for a year,  during which they refrained from oiling their hair, attended public  festivals rarely, and only (in the case of women) when their mothers  ordered, and were forbidden to marry again.    This, however, was not all. Once in twelve years was held a great  ceremony of re-interment,--a solemn \"feast of the dead,\" as it was  called. Until the day of this feast arrived, funeral rites in honor of  the departed were repeated from time to time, and feasts were held, at  which, as the expression was, their names were revived, while presents  were distributed, as at the time of their death. The great Feast of the  Dead, however, was the most important of all their ceremonies. The  bodies of all who had died in the nation during the preceding twelve  years were then exhumed, or removed from the scaffolds on which they had  been laid, and the festering corpses or cleansed bones were all interred  together in a vast pit lined with robes of beaver skins, the most  precious of all their furs. Wampum, copper implements, earthenware, the  most valued of their possessions, were cast into the pit, which was then  solemnly closed with earth. While the ceremony was going on, rich  presents of all descriptions, the accumulations of the past twelve  years, were distributed by the relatives of the deceased among the  people. In this distribution, strange to say, valuable fur robes were  frequently cut and torn to pieces, so as to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8599"],[0,"Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights (#13)"],[1,"to a sprightly  disposition and irreproachable conduct, distinguished her among all  the princesses of her time.    The sultan, her uncle, proposed to get her married, when she  arrived at a proper age, to some neighbouring prince, and was  thinking seriously about it, when he perceived that the three  princes his sons had all fallen in love with her. He was very much  concerned, owing to the difficulty he foresaw whether the two  younger would consent to yield to their elder brother. He spoke to  each of them apart; and after having remonstrated on the  impossibility of one princess being the wife of three persons, and  the troubles they would create if they persisted, he did all he  could to persuade them to abide by a declaration of the princess in  favour of one of them; or to suffer her to be married to a foreign  prince. But as he found them obstinate, he sent for them all  together, and said to them, 'Children, since I have not been able  to persuade you no longer to aspire to marry the princess your  cousin; and as I have no inclination to force her to marry any of  you, I have thought of a plan which will please you all, and  preserve union among you, if you will but follow my advice. I think  it would be best, if every one travelled separately into a  different country, so that you might not meet each other: and as  you know I delight in every thing that is rare and singular, I  promise my niece in marriage to him that shall bring me the most  extraordinary curiosity; and for travelling expenses, I will give  each of you a sum befitting your rank and the purchase of the  curiosity you search.'    As the three princes were always submissive and obedient to the  sultan's will, and each flattered himself that fortune would favour  him, they all consented. The sultan gave them the money he  promised; and that very day they issued orders in preparation for  their travels, and took leave of the sultan, that they might be  ready to set out early the next morning. They all went out at the  same gate of the city, each dressed like a merchant, attended by a  trusty officer dressed like a slave, all well mounted and equipped.  They went the first day's journey together; and slept at the first  inn, where the road divided into three different tracks. At night  when they were at supper together, they agreed to travel for a  year, and to make that inn their rendezvous; that the first that  came should wait for the rest; that as they had all three taken  leave together of the sultan, they should all return together. The  next morning by break of day, after they had embraced and wished  each other good success, they mounted their horses, and each took a  different road.    Prince Houssain, the eldest brother, who had heard wonders of the  extent, strength, riches, and splendour of the kingdom of Bisnagar,  bent his course towards the Indian coast; and, after three months  travelling with different caravans, sometimes over deserts and  barren mountains, and sometimes through populous and fertile  countries, he arrived at Bisnagar, the capital of the kingdom of  that name and the residence of its king. He lodged at a khan  appointed for foreign merchants; and having learnt that there were  four principal quarters where merchants of all sorts kept their  shops, in the midst of which stood the castle, or rather the king's  palace, as the centre of the city, surrounded by three courts, and  each gate two leagues distant from the other, he went to one of  these quarters the next day.    Prince Houssain could not see this quarter without admiration. It  was large, and divided into several streets, all vaulted and shaded  from the sun, and yet very light. The shops were all of the same  size and proportion; and all that dealt in the same sort of  merchandise, as well as the craftsmen, lived in one street.    The multitude of shops stocked with the finest linens from several  parts of India, some painted in the brightest colours, with men,  landscapes, trees, and flowers; silks and brocades from Persia,  China, and other places; porcelain from Japan and China, foot  carpets of all sizes,--all this surprised him so much that he knew  not how to believe his own eyes; but when he came to the shops of  the goldsmiths and jewellers (for those two trades were exercised  by the same merchants), he was dazzled by the lustre of the pearls,  diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and other precious stones exposed for  sale. But if he was amazed at seeing so many riches in one place,  he was much more surprised when he came to judge of the wealth of  the whole kingdom by considering that except the Brahmins and  ministers of the idols, who profess a life retired from worldly  vanity, there was not an Indian, man or woman, through the extent  of that kingdom, who did not wear necklaces, bracelets, and  ornaments about their legs and feet, made of pearls and other  precious stones.    Another thing Prince Houssain particularly admired was the great  number of rose-sellers, who crowded the streets; for the Indians  are such lovers of that flower, that not one will stir without a  nosegay in his hand, or a garland on his head; and the merchants  keep them in pots in their shops, so that the air of the whole  quarter, however large, is perfectly perfumed.    After Prince Houssain had run through the quarter, street by  street, his thoughts fully occupied by the riches he had seen, he  was very much tired, and a merchant civilly invited him to sit down  in his shop. He accepted the offer; but had not been seated long  before he saw a crier pass by with a piece of carpet on his arm,  about six feet square, and cry it at thirty purses. The prince  called to the crier, and asked to see the carpet, which seemed to  him to be valued at an exorbitant price, not only for its size, but  the meanness of the stuff. When he had examined it well, he told  the crier that he could not comprehend how so small and poor a  piece could be priced so high.    The crier, who took him for a merchant, replied, 'Sir, if this  price seems so extravagant to you, your amazement will be greater  when I tell you I have orders to raise it to forty purses, and not  to part with it for less.'    'Certainly,' answered Prince Houssain, 'it must have something very  extraordinary about it, which I know nothing of.'    'You have guessed right, sir,' replied the crier, 'and will own as  much when you come to know that whoever sits on this piece of  carpet may be transported in an instant wherever he desires to go  without being stopped by any obstacle.'    At this the Prince of the Indies, considering that the principal  motive of his journey was to carry some singular curiosity home to  the sultan his father, thought that be could not meet with anything  which could give him more satisfaction. 'If the carpet,' said he to  the crier, 'has the virtue you assign it, I shall not think forty  purses too much but shall make you a present besides.'    'Sir,' replied the crier, 'I have told you the truth; and it will  be an easy matter to convince you of it, as soon as you have made  the bargain for forty purses, by experiment. But as I suppose you  have not so much with you, and that I must go with you to the khan  where you lodge, with the leave of the master of the shop we will  go into his back shop, and I will spread the carpet; and when we  have both sat down, and you have formed the wish to be transported  into your room at the khan, if we are not transported thither it  shall be no bargain. As to your present, as I am paid for my  trouble by the seller, I shall receive it as a favour, and be very  much obliged to you for it.'    The prince accepted the conditions, and concluded the bargain; and  having obtained the master's leave, they went into his back shop;  they both sat down on the carpet, and as soon as the prince wished  to be transported into his room at the khan, he found himself and  the crier there, and as he wanted no more convincing proof of the  virtue of the carpet, he counted to the crier forty purses of gold,  and gave him twenty pieces for himself.    In this manner Prince Houssain became the possessor of the carpet,  and was overjoyed that on his arrival at Bisnagar he had found so  rare a treasure, which he never doubted would gain him the Princess  Nouronnihar. In short he looked upon it as an impossible thing for  the princes, his younger brothers, to meet with anything to compare  with it. It was in his power, by sitting on this carpet, to be at  the place of rendezvous that very day; but as he was obliged to  wait for his brothers, as they had agreed, and as he was curious to  see the King of Bisnagar and his court, and to learn about the  laws, customs, and religion of the kingdom, he chose to make a  longer abode there.    It was a custom of the King of Bisnagar to give audience to all  strange merchants once a week; and Prince Houssain, who remained  incognito, saw him often; and as he was handsome, clever, and  extremely polite, he easily distinguished himself among the  merchants, and was preferred before them all by the sultan, who  asked him about the Sultan of the Indies, and the government,  strength, and riches of his dominions.    The rest of his time the prince spent in seeing what was most  remarkable in and about the city; and among other things he visited  a temple, all built of brass. It was ten cubits square, and fifteen  high; and the greatest ornament to it was an idol of the height of a  man, of massy gold: its eyes were two rubies, set so artificially,  that it seemed to look at those who looked at it, on whichever side  they turned. Besides this, there was another not less curious, in a  village in the midst of a plain of about ten acres, which was a  delicious garden full of roses and the choicest flowers, surrounded  with a small wall breast high, to keep the cattle out. In the midst  of this plain was raised a terrace, a man's"]]]
