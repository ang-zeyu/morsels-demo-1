On each Sabbath thereafter, as  the obstinate preacher would not end his sermon one minute sooner than  his habitual time, which was long after twelve, the equally stubborn  limited-time worshipper arose at noon, as he had stipulated, and stalked  noisily out of meeting.    A minister about to preach in a neighboring parish was told of a custom  which prevailed there of persons who lived at a distance rising and leaving  the house ere the sermon was ended. He determined to teach them a lesson,  and announced that he would preach the first part of his sermon to the  sinners, and the latter part to the saints, and that the sinners would of  course all leave as soon as their portion had been delivered. Every soul  remained until the end of the service.    At last, when other means of entertainment and recreation than church-going  became common, and other forms of public addresses than sermons were  frequently given, New England church-goers became so restless and  rebellious under the regime of hour-long prayers and indefinitely  protracted sermons that the long services were gradually condensed and  curtailed, to the relief of both preacher and hearers.          VIII.    The Icy Temperature of the Meeting-House.        In colonial days in New England the long and tedious services must have  been hard to endure in the unheated churches in bitter winter weather, so  bitter that, as Judge Sewall pathetically recorded, \"The communion bread  was frozen pretty hard and rattled sadly into the plates.\" Sadly down  through the centuries is ringing in our ears the gloomy rattle of that  frozen sacramental bread on the Church plate, telling to us the solemn  story of the austere and comfortless church-life of our ancestors. Would  that the sound could bring to our chilled hearts the same steadfast and  pure Christian faith that made their gloomy, freezing services warm with  God's loving presence!    Again Judge Sewall wrote: \"Extraordinary Cold Storm of Wind and Snow. Blows  much more as coming home at Noon, and so holds on. Bread was frozen at  Lord's Table. Though 't was so cold John Tuckerman was baptized. At six  o'clock my ink freezes, so that I can hardly write by a good fire in my  Wives chamber. Yet was very Comfortable at Meeting.\" In the penultimate  sentence of this quotation may be found the clue and explanation of the  seemingly incredible assertion in the last sentence. The reason why he was  comfortable in church was that he was accustomed to sit in cold rooms; even  with the great open-mouthed and open-chimneyed fireplaces full of blazing  logs, so little heat entered the rooms of colonial dwelling-houses that one  could not be warm unless fairly within the chimney-place; and thus, even  while sitting by the fire, his ink froze. Another entry of Judge Sewall's  tells of an exceeding cold day when there was \"Great Coughing\" in meeting,  and yet a new-born baby was brought into the icy church to be baptized.  Children were always carried to the meeting-house for baptism the first  Sunday after birth, even in the most bitter weather. There are no entries  in Judge Sewall's diary which exhibit him in so lovable and gentle a light  as the records of the baptism of his fourteen children,--his pride when  the child did not cry out or shrink from the water in the freezing winter  weather, thus early showing true Puritan fortitude; and also his noble  resolves and hopes for their future. On this especially cold day when a  baby was baptized, the minister prayed for a mitigation of the weather,  and on the same day in another town \"Rev. Mr. Wigglesworth preached on the  text, Who can stand before His Cold? Then by his own and people's sickness  three Sabbaths passed without public Worship.\" February 20 he preached from  these words: \"He sends forth his word and thaws them.\" And the very next  day a thaw set in which was regarded as a direct answer to his prayer and  sermon. Sceptics now-a-days would suggest that he chose well the time to  pray for milder weather.    Many persons now living can remember the universal and noisy turning up  of great-coat collars, the swinging of arms, and knocking together of the  heavy-booted feet of the listeners towards the end of a long winter sermon.  Dr. Hopkins used to say, when the noisy tintamarre began, \"My hearers, have  a little patience, and I will soon close.\"    Another clergyman was irritated beyond endurance by the stamping,  clattering feet, a _supplosio pedis_ that he regarded as an irreverent  protest and complaint against the severity of the weather, rather than as a  hint to him to conclude his long sermon. He suddenly and noisily closed his  sermon-book, leaned forward out of his high pulpit, and thundered out these  Biblical words of rebuke at his freezing congregation, whose startled faces  stared up at him through dense clouds of vapor. \"Out of whose womb came the  ice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? The waters are  hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. Knowest thou the  ordinance of heaven? Canst thou set the dominion thereof on the earth?  Great things doth God which we cannot comprehend. He saith to the snow, Be  thou on the earth. By the breath of God frost is given. He causeth it to  come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. Hearken unto  this. _Stand still_, and consider the wondrous works of God.\" We can  believe that he roared out the words \"stand still,\" and that there was no  more noise in that meeting-house on cold Sundays during the remainder of  that winter.    The ministers might well argue that no one suffered more from the freezing  atmosphere than they did. In many records I find that they were forced to  preach and pray with their hands cased in woollen or fur mittens or heavy  knit gloves; and they wore long camlet cloaks in the pulpit and covered  their heads with skull caps--as did Judge Sewall--and possibly wore, as he  did also, a _hood_. Many a wig-hating minister must, in the Arctic  meeting-house, have longed secretly for the grateful warmth to his head and  neck of one of those \"horrid Bushes of Vanity,\" a full-bottomed flowing  wig.    On bitter winter days Dr. Stevens of Kittery used to send a servant to the  meeting-house to find out how many of his flock had braved the piercing  blasts. If only seven persons were present, the servant asked them to  return with him to the parsonage to listen to the sermon; but if there were  eight members in the meeting-house he so reported to the Doctor, who then  donned his long worsted cloak, tied it around his waist with a great  handkerchief, and attired thus, with a fur cap pulled down over his ears,  and with heavy mittens on his hands, ploughed through the deep snow to  the church, and in the same dress preached his long, knotty sermon in  his pulpit, while fierce wintry blasts rattled the windows and shook the  turret, and the eight godly, shivering souls wished profoundly that one of  their number had \"lain at home in a slothfull, lazey, prophane way,\" and  thus permitted the seven others and the minister to have the sermon in  comfort in the parsonage kitchen before the great blazing logs in the open  fireplace.    Ah, it makes one shiver even to think of those gloomy churches, growing  colder, and more congealed through weeks of heavy frost and fierce  northwesters until they bore the chill of death itself. One can but  wonder whether that fell scourge of New England, that hereditary  curse--consumption--did not have its first germs evolved and nourished in  our Puritan ancestors by the Spartan custom of sitting through the long  winter services in the icy, death-like meeting-houses.    Of the insufficient clothing of the church attendants of olden times it  is unnecessary to speak with much detail. The goodmen with their heavy  top-boots or jack-boots, their milled or frieze stockings, their warm  periwigs surmounted by fur caps or beaver hats or hoods; and with their  many-caped great-coats or full round cloaks were dressed with a sufficient  degree of comfort, though they did not possess the warm woollen and silken  underclothing which now make a man's winter attire so comfortable. They  carried muffs too, as the advertisements of the times show. The \"Boston  News Letter\" of 1716 offers a reward for a man's muff lost on the Sabbath  day in the street. In 1725 Dr. Prince lost his black bearskin muff, and in  1740 a \"sableskin man's muff\" was advertised as having been lost.    But the Puritan goodwives and maidens were dressed in a meagre and scanty  fashion that when now considered seems fairly appalling. As soon as  the colonies grew in wealth and fashion, thin silk or cotton hose were  frequently worn in midwinter by the wives and daughters of well-to-do  colonists; and correspondingly thin cloth or kid or silk slippers,  high-channelled pumps, or low shoes with paper soles and \"cross-cut\" or  wooden heels were the holiday and Sabbath-day covering for the feet. In wet  weather clogs and pattens formed an extra and much needed protection  when the fair colonists walked. Linen underclothing formed the first  superstructure of the feminine costume and threw its penetrating chill to  the very marrow of the bones. Often in mid-winter the scant-skirted French  calico gowns were made with short elbow sleeves and round, low necks, and  the throat and shoulders were lightly covered with thin lawn neckerchiefs  or dimity tuckers. The flaunting hooped-petticoat of another decade was  worn with a silk or brocade sacque. A thin cloth cape or mantle or spencer,  lined with sarcenet silk, was frequently the only covering for the  shoulders.

He told me I was mad or drunk, but  lit a lamp and returned with me, to find my horror only a heap of  clothes thrown on the table in such a way that, as the moon's pale light  shot it, it struck upon my black student's gown, with a white card lying  on it, and produced the effect of a coffin and plate. The face was a  crumpled handkerchief, and what seemed hair a brown muffler. As the moon  sank, these outlines changed and, incredible as it may seem, grew like a  face. My friend not having had the fright enjoyed the joke, and  'Coffins' was my sobriquet for a long while.\"    \"You get worse and worse. Sir Jasper, do vary the horrors by a touch of  fun, or I shall run away,\" said Blanche, glancing over her shoulder  nervously.    \"I'll do my best, and tell a story my uncle used to relate of his young  days. I forget the name of the place, but it was some little country  town famous among anglers. My uncle often went to fish, and always  regretted that a deserted house near the trout stream was not occupied,  for the inn was inconveniently distant. Speaking of this one evening as  he lounged in the landlady's parlor, he asked why no one took it and let  the rooms to strangers in the fishing season. 'For fear of the  ghostissess, your honor,' replied the woman, and proceeded to tell, him  that three distinct spirits haunted the house. In the garret was heard  the hum of a wheel and the tap of high-heeled shoes, as the ghostly  spinner went to and fro. In a chamber sounded the sharpening of a knife,  followed by groans and the drip of blood. The cellar was made awful by a  skeleton sitting on a half-buried box and chuckling fiendishly. It seems  a miser lived there once, and was believed to have starved his daughter  in the garret, keeping her at work till she died. The second spirit was  that of the girl's rejected lover, who cut his throat in the chamber,  and the third of the miser who was found dead on the money chest he was  too feeble to conceal. My uncle laughed at all this, and offered to lay  the ghosts if anyone would take the house.    \"This offer got abroad, and a crusty old fellow accepted it, hoping to  turn a penny. He had a pretty girl, whose love had been thwarted by the  old man, and whose lover was going to sea in despair. My uncle knew this  and pitied the young people. He had made acquaintance with a wandering  artist, and the two agreed to conquer the prejudices against the house  by taking rooms there. They did so, and after satisfying themselves  regarding the noises, consulted a wise old woman as to the best means of  laying the ghosts. She told them if any young girl would pass a night in  each haunted room, praying piously the while, that all would be well.  Peggy was asked if she would do it, and being a stouthearted lass she  consented, for a round sum, to try it. The first night was in the  garret, and Peggy, in spite of the prophecies of the village gossips,  came out alive, though listeners at the door heard the weird humming and  tapping all night long. The next night all went well, and from that time  no more sharpening, groaning, or dripping was heard. The third time she  bade her friends good-bye and, wrapped in her red cloak, with a lamp and  prayer book, went down into the cellar. Alas for pretty Peggy! When day  came she was gone, and with her the miser's empty box, though his bones  remained to prove how well she had done her work.    \"The town was in an uproar, and the old man furious. Some said the devil  had flown away with her, others that the bones were hers, and all agreed  that henceforth another ghost would haunt the house. My uncle and the  artist did their best to comfort the father, who sorely reproached  himself for thwarting the girl's love, and declared that if Jack would  find her he should have her. But Jack had sailed, and the old man 'was  left lamenting.' The house was freed from its unearthly visitors,  however, for no ghost appeared; and when my uncle left, old Martin found  money and letter informing him that Peggy had spent her first two nights  preparing for flight, and on the third had gone away to marry and sail  with Jack. The noises had been produced by the artist, who was a  ventriloquist, the skeleton had been smuggled from the surgeons, and the  whole thing was a conspiracy to help Peggy and accommodate the  fishermen.\"    \"It is evident that roguery is hereditary,\" laughed Rose as the  narrator paused.    \"I strongly suspect that Sir Jasper the second was the true hero of that  story,\" added Mrs. Snowdon.    \"Think what you like, I've done my part, and leave the stage for  you, madam.\"    \"I will come last. It is your turn, dear.\" As Mrs. Snowdon softly  uttered the last word, and Octavia leaned upon her knee with an  affectionate glance, Treherne leaned forward to catch a glimpse of the  two changed faces, and looked as if bewildered when both smiled at him,  as they sat hand in hand while the girl told her story.    \"Long ago a famous actress suddenly dropped dead at the close of a  splendidly played tragedy. She was carried home, and preparations were  made to bury her. The play had been gotten up with great care and  expense, and a fine actor was the hero. The public demanded a  repetition, and an inferior person was engaged to take the dead lady's  part. A day's delay had been necessary, but when the night came the  house was crowded. They waited both before and behind the curtain for  the debut of the new actress, with much curiosity. She stood waiting for  her cue, but as it was given, to the amazement of all, the great  tragedienne glided upon the stage. Pale as marble, and with a strange  fire in her eyes, strange pathos in her voice, strange power in her  acting, she went through her part, and at the close vanished as  mysteriously as she came. Great was the excitement that night, and  intense the astonishment and horror next day when it was whispered  abroad that the dead woman never had revived, but had lain in her coffin  before the eyes of watchers all the evening, when hundreds fancied they  were applauding her at the theater. The mystery never was cleared up,  and Paris was divided by two opinions: one that some person marvelously  like Madame Z. had personated her for the sake of a sensation; the other  that the ghost of the dead actress, unable to free itself from the old  duties so full of fascination to an ambitious and successful woman, had  played for the last time the part which had made her famous.\"    \"Where did you find that, Tavie? It's very French, and not bad if you  invented it,\" said Sir Jasper.    \"I read it in an old book, where it was much better told. Now, Edith,  there is just time for your tale.\"    As the word \"Edith\" passed her lips, again Treherne started and eyed  them both, and again they smiled, as Mrs. Snowdon caressed the  smooth cheek leaning on her knee, and looking full at him began the  last recital.    \"You have been recounting the pranks of imaginary ghosts; let me show  you the workings of some real spirits, evil and good, that haunt every  heart and home, making its misery or joy. At Christmastime, in a country  house, a party of friends met to keep the holidays, and very happily  they might have done so had not one person marred the peace of several.  Love, jealousy, deceit, and nobleness were the spirits that played their  freaks with these people. The person of whom I speak was more haunted  than the rest, and much tormented, being willful, proud, and jealous.  Heaven help her, she had had no one to exorcise these ghosts for her,  and they goaded her to do much harm. Among these friends there were more  than one pair of lovers, and much tangling of plots and plans, for  hearts are wayward and mysterious things, and cannot love as duty bids  or prudence counsels. This woman held the key to all the secrets of the  house, and, having a purpose to gain, she used her power selfishly, for  a time. To satisfy a doubt, she feigned a fancy for a gentleman who once  did her the honor of admiring her, and, to the great scandal of certain  sage persons, permitted him to show his regard for her, knowing that it  was but a transient amusement on his part as well as upon hers. In the  hands of this woman lay a secret which could make or mar the happiness  of the best and dearest of the party. The evil spirits which haunted her  urged her to mar their peace and gratify a sinful hope. On the other  side, honor, justice, and generosity prompted her to make them happy,  and while she wavered there came to her a sweet enchantress who, with a  word, banished the tormenting ghosts forever, and gave the haunted woman  a talisman to keep her free henceforth.\"    There the earnest voice faltered, and with a sudden impulse Mrs. Snowdon  bent her head and kissed the fair forehead which had bent lower and  lower as she went on. Each listener understood the truth, lightly veiled  in that hasty fable, and each found in it a different meaning. Sir  Jasper frowned and bit his lips, Annon glanced anxiously from face to  face, Octavia hid hers, and Treherne's flashed with sudden intelligence,  while Rose laughed low to herself, enjoying the scene. Blanche, who was  getting sleepy, said, with a stifled gape, \"That is a very nice, moral  little story, but I wish there had been some real ghosts in it.\"    \"There was. Will you come and see them?\"    As she put the question, Mrs. Snowdon rose abruptly, wishing to end the  seance, and beckoning them to follow glided up the great stairway. All  obeyed, wondering what whim possessed her, and quite ready for any jest  in store for them.          Chapter VIII      JASPER    She led them to the north gallery and, pausing at the door, said  merrily, \"The ghost--or ghosts rather, for there were two--which  frightened Patty were Sir Jasper and myself, meeting to discuss certain  important matters"]]]
