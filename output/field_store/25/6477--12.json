David the son of Jesse             said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of             the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,    10:023:002 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my             tongue.    10:023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He             that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.    10:023:004 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun             riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass             springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.    10:023:005 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me             an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for             this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make             it not to grow.    10:023:006 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust             away, because they cannot be taken with hands:    10:023:007 But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and             the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with             fire in the same place.    10:023:008 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The             Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the             same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight             hundred, whom he slew at one time.    10:023:009 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of             the three mighty men with David, when they defied the             Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and             the men of Israel were gone away:    10:023:010 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary,             and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a             great victory that day; and the people returned after him only             to spoil.    10:023:011 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And             the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was             a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from             the Philistines.    10:023:012 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and             slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.    10:023:013 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in             the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of             the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.    10:023:014 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the             Philistines was then in Bethlehem.    10:023:015 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of             the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!    10:023:016 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the             Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that             was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:             nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out             unto the LORD.    10:023:017 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:             is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of             their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did             these three mighty men.    10:023:018 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was             chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three             hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.    10:023:019 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their             captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.    10:023:020 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of             Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of             Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit             in time of snow:    10:023:021 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a             spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and             plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him             with his own spear.    10:023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name             among three mighty men.    10:023:023 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to             the first three. And David set him over his guard.    10:023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the             son of Dodo of Bethlehem,    10:023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,    10:023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,    10:023:027 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,    10:023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,    10:023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of             Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,    10:023:030 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,    10:023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,    10:023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,    10:023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,    10:023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,             Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,    10:023:035 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,    10:023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,    10:023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to             Joab the son of Zeruiah,    10:023:038 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,    10:023:039 Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.    10:024:001 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,             and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and             Judah.    10:024:002 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was             with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan             even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know             the number of the people.    10:024:003 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the             people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the             eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the             king delight in this thing?    10:024:004 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and             against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of             the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the             people of Israel.    10:024:005 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the             right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of             Gad, and toward Jazer:    10:024:006 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and             they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,    10:024:007 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of             the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the             south of Judah, even to Beersheba.    10:024:008 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to             Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.    10:024:009 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the             king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant             men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five             hundred thousand men.    10:024:010 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the             people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in             that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away             the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.    10:024:011 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD             came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,    10:024:012 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three             things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.    10:024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall             seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou             flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue             thee? or that there be three days'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8018"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 18: Job (#13)"],[1,"and ashes.    18:042:007 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto             Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is             kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have             not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job             hath.    18:042:008 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and             go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt             offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will             I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye             have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my             servant Job.    18:042:009 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the             Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them:             the LORD also accepted Job.    18:042:010 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for             his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had             before.    18:042:011 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his             sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance             before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they             bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the             LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of             money, and every one an earring of gold.    18:042:012 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his             beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six             thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand             she asses.    18:042:013 He had also seven sons and three daughters.    18:042:014 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of             the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.    18:042:015 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the             daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among             their brethren.    18:042:016 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his             sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.    18:042:017 So Job died, being old and full of days."]]]
