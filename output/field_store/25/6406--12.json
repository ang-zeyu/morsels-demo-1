[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/62"],[0,"A Princess of Mars (#13)"],[1,"side-splitting witticism according to the  ethics which rule green Martian humor.    That I have taken moments to write down a part of what occurred as that  blow fell does not signify that I remained inactive for any such length  of time.  I think I must have sensed something of what was coming, for  I realize now that I was crouched as for a spring as I saw the blow  aimed at her beautiful, upturned, pleading face, and ere the hand  descended I was halfway across the hall.    Scarcely had his hideous laugh rang out but once, when I was upon him.  The brute was twelve feet in height and armed to the teeth, but I  believe that I could have accounted for the whole roomful in the  terrific intensity of my rage.  Springing upward, I struck him full in  the face as he turned at my warning cry and then as he drew his  short-sword I drew mine and sprang up again upon his breast, hooking  one leg over the butt of his pistol and grasping one of his huge tusks  with my left hand while I delivered blow after blow upon his enormous  chest.    He could not use his short-sword to advantage because I was too close  to him, nor could he draw his pistol, which he attempted to do in  direct opposition to Martian custom which says that you may not fight a  fellow warrior in private combat with any other than the weapon with  which you are attacked.  In fact he could do nothing but make a wild  and futile attempt to dislodge me.  With all his immense bulk he was  little if any stronger than I, and it was but the matter of a moment or  two before he sank, bleeding and lifeless, to the floor.    Dejah Thoris had raised herself upon one elbow and was watching the  battle with wide, staring eyes.  When I had regained my feet I raised  her in my arms and bore her to one of the benches at the side of the  room.    Again no Martian interfered with me, and tearing a piece of silk from  my cape I endeavored to staunch the flow of blood from her nostrils.  I  was soon successful as her injuries amounted to little more than an  ordinary nosebleed, and when she could speak she placed her hand upon  my arm and looking up into my eyes, said:    \"Why did you do it?  You who refused me even friendly recognition in  the first hour of my peril!  And now you risk your life and kill one of  your companions for my sake.  I cannot understand.  What strange manner  of man are you, that you consort with the green men, though your form  is that of my race, while your color is little darker than that of the  white ape?  Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?\"    \"It is a strange tale,\" I replied, \"too long to attempt to tell you  now, and one which I so much doubt the credibility of myself that I  fear to hope that others will believe it.  Suffice it, for the present,  that I am your friend, and, so far as our captors will permit, your  protector and your servant.\"    \"Then you too are a prisoner?  But why, then, those arms and the  regalia of a Tharkian chieftain?  What is your name?  Where your  country?\"    \"Yes, Dejah Thoris, I too am a prisoner; my name is John Carter, and I  claim Virginia, one of the United States of America, Earth, as my home;  but why I am permitted to wear arms I do not know, nor was I aware that  my regalia was that of a chieftain.\"    We were interrupted at this juncture by the approach of one of the  warriors, bearing arms, accoutrements and ornaments, and in a flash one  of her questions was answered and a puzzle cleared up for me.  I saw  that the body of my dead antagonist had been stripped, and I read in  the menacing yet respectful attitude of the warrior who had brought me  these trophies of the kill the same demeanor as that evinced by the  other who had brought me my original equipment, and now for the first  time I realized that my blow, on the occasion of my first battle in the  audience chamber had resulted in the death of my adversary.    The reason for the whole attitude displayed toward me was now apparent;  I had won my spurs, so to speak, and in the crude justice, which always  marks Martian dealings, and which, among other things, has caused me to  call her the planet of paradoxes, I was accorded the honors due a  conqueror; the trappings and the position of the man I killed.  In  truth, I was a Martian chieftain, and this I learned later was the  cause of my great freedom and my toleration in the audience chamber.    As I had turned to receive the dead warrior's chattels I had noticed  that Tars Tarkas and several others had pushed forward toward us, and  the eyes of the former rested upon me in a most quizzical manner.  Finally he addressed me:    \"You speak the tongue of Barsoom quite readily for one who was deaf and  dumb to us a few short days ago.  Where did you learn it, John Carter?\"    \"You, yourself, are responsible, Tars Tarkas,\" I replied, \"in that you  furnished me with an instructress of remarkable ability; I have to  thank Sola for my learning.\"    \"She has done well,\" he answered, \"but your education in other respects  needs considerable polish.  Do you know what your unprecedented  temerity would have cost you had you failed to kill either of the two  chieftains whose metal you now wear?\"    \"I presume that that one whom I had failed to kill, would have killed  me,\" I answered, smiling.    \"No, you are wrong.  Only in the last extremity of self-defense would a  Martian warrior kill a prisoner; we like to save them for other  purposes,\" and his face bespoke possibilities that were not pleasant to  dwell upon.    \"But one thing can save you now,\" he continued.  \"Should you, in  recognition of your remarkable valor, ferocity, and prowess, be  considered by Tal Hajus as worthy of his service you may be taken into  the community and become a full-fledged Tharkian.  Until we reach the  headquarters of Tal Hajus it is the will of Lorquas Ptomel that you be  accorded the respect your acts have earned you.  You will be treated by  us as a Tharkian chieftain, but you must not forget that every chief  who ranks you is responsible for your safe delivery to our mighty and  most ferocious ruler.  I am done.\"    \"I hear you, Tars Tarkas,\" I answered.  \"As you know I am not of  Barsoom; your ways are not my ways, and I can only act in the future as  I have in the past, in accordance with the dictates of my conscience  and guided by the standards of mine own people.  If you will leave me  alone I will go in peace, but if not, let the individual Barsoomians  with whom I must deal either respect my rights as a stranger among you,  or take whatever consequences may befall.  Of one thing let us be sure,  whatever may be your ultimate intentions toward this unfortunate young  woman, whoever would offer her injury or insult in the future must  figure on making a full accounting to me.  I understand that you  belittle all sentiments of generosity and kindliness, but I do not, and  I can convince your most doughty warrior that these characteristics are  not incompatible with an ability to fight.\"    Ordinarily I am not given to long speeches, nor ever before had I  descended to bombast, but I had guessed at the keynote which would  strike an answering chord in the breasts of the green Martians, nor was  I wrong, for my harangue evidently deeply impressed them, and their  attitude toward me thereafter was still further respectful.    Tars Tarkas himself seemed pleased with my reply, but his only comment  was more or less enigmatical--\"And I think I know Tal Hajus, Jeddak of  Thark.\"    I now turned my attention to Dejah Thoris, and assisting her to her  feet I turned with her toward the exit, ignoring her hovering guardian  harpies as well as the inquiring glances of the chieftains.  Was I not  now a chieftain also!  Well, then, I would assume the responsibilities  of one.  They did not molest us, and so Dejah Thoris, Princess of  Helium, and John Carter, gentleman of Virginia, followed by the  faithful Woola, passed through utter silence from the audience chamber  of Lorquas Ptomel, Jed among the Tharks of Barsoom.          CHAPTER XI    WITH DEJAH THORIS      As we reached the open the two female guards who had been detailed to  watch over Dejah Thoris hurried up and made as though to assume custody  of her once more.  The poor child shrank against me and I felt her two  little hands fold tightly over my arm.  Waving the women away, I  informed them that Sola would attend the captive hereafter, and I  further warned Sarkoja that any more of her cruel attentions bestowed  upon Dejah Thoris would result in Sarkoja's sudden and painful demise.    My threat was unfortunate and resulted in more harm than good to Dejah  Thoris, for, as I learned later, men do not kill women upon Mars, nor  women, men.  So Sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and departed to  hatch up deviltries against us.    I soon found Sola and explained to her that I wished her to guard Dejah  Thoris as she had guarded me; that I wished her to find other quarters  where they would not be molested by Sarkoja, and I finally informed her  that I myself would take up my quarters among the men.    Sola glanced at the accouterments which were carried in my hand and  slung across my shoulder.    \"You are a great chieftain now, John Carter,\" she said, \"and I must do  your bidding, though indeed I am glad to do it under any circumstances.  The man whose metal you carry was young, but he was a great warrior,  and had by his promotions and kills won his way close to the rank of  Tars Tarkas, who, as you know, is second to Lorquas Ptomel only.  You  are eleventh, there are but ten chieftains in this community who rank  you in prowess.\"    \"And if I should kill Lorquas Ptomel?\" I asked.    \"You would be first, John Carter; but you may only win that honor by  the will of the entire council that Lorquas Ptomel meet you in combat,  or should he attack you, you may kill him in self-defense, and thus win  first place.\"    I laughed, and changed the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624"],[0,"Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887 (#13)"],[1,"all do the best they can,\" I answered, \"the amount of  the product resulting is twice greater from one man than from another.\"    \"Very true,\" replied Dr. Leete; \"but the amount of the resulting  product has nothing whatever to do with the question, which is one of  desert. Desert is a moral question, and the amount of the product a  material quantity. It would be an extraordinary sort of logic which  should try to determine a moral question by a material standard. The  amount of the effort alone is pertinent to the question of desert. All  men who do their best, do the same. A man's endowments, however  godlike, merely fix the measure of his duty. The man of great  endowments who does not do all he might, though he may do more than a  man of small endowments who does his best, is deemed a less deserving  worker than the latter, and dies a debtor to his fellows. The Creator  sets men's tasks for them by the faculties he gives them; we simply  exact their fulfillment.\"    \"No doubt that is very fine philosophy,\" I said; \"nevertheless it seems  hard that the man who produces twice as much as another, even if both  do their best, should have only the same share.\"    \"Does it, indeed, seem so to you?\" responded Dr. Leete. \"Now, do you  know, that seems very curious to me? The way it strikes people nowadays  is, that a man who can produce twice as much as another with the same  effort, instead of being rewarded for doing so, ought to be punished if  he does not do so. In the nineteenth century, when a horse pulled a  heavier load than a goat, I suppose you rewarded him. Now, we should  have whipped him soundly if he had not, on the ground that, being much  stronger, he ought to. It is singular how ethical standards change.\"  The doctor said this with such a twinkle in his eye that I was obliged  to laugh.    \"I suppose,\" I said, \"that the real reason that we rewarded men for  their endowments, while we considered those of horses and goats merely  as fixing the service to be severally required of them, was that the  animals, not being reasoning beings, naturally did the best they could,  whereas men could only be induced to do so by rewarding them according  to the amount of their product. That brings me to ask why, unless human  nature has mightily changed in a hundred years, you are not under the  same necessity.\"    \"We are,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"I don't think there has been any change  in human nature in that respect since your day. It is still so  constituted that special incentives in the form of prizes, and  advantages to be gained, are requisite to call out the best endeavors  of the average man in any direction.\"    \"But what inducement,\" I asked, \"can a man have to put forth his best  endeavors when, however much or little he accomplishes, his income  remains the same? High characters may be moved by devotion to the  common welfare under such a system, but does not the average man tend  to rest back on his oar, reasoning that it is of no use to make a  special effort, since the effort will not increase his income, nor its  withholding diminish it?\"    \"Does it then really seem to you,\" answered my companion, \"that human  nature is insensible to any motives save fear of want and love of  luxury, that you should expect security and equality of livelihood to  leave them without possible incentives to effort? Your contemporaries  did not really think so, though they might fancy they did. When it was  a question of the grandest class of efforts, the most absolute  self-devotion, they depended on quite other incentives. Not higher  wages, but honor and the hope of men's gratitude, patriotism and the  inspiration of duty, were the motives which they set before their  soldiers when it was a question of dying for the nation, and never was  there an age of the world when those motives did not call out what is  best and noblest in men. And not only this, but when you come to  analyze the love of money which was the general impulse to effort in  your day, you find that the dread of want and desire of luxury was but  one of several motives which the pursuit of money represented; the  others, and with many the more influential, being desire of power, of  social position, and reputation for ability and success. So you see  that though we have abolished poverty and the fear of it, and  inordinate luxury with the hope of it, we have not touched the greater  part of the motives which underlay the love of money in former times,  or any of those which prompted the supremer sorts of effort. The  coarser motives, which no longer move us, have been replaced by higher  motives wholly unknown to the mere wage earners of your age. Now that  industry of whatever sort is no longer self-service, but service of the  nation, patriotism, passion for humanity, impel the worker as in your  day they did the soldier. The army of industry is an army, not alone by  virtue of its perfect organization, but by reason also of the ardor of  self-devotion which animates its members.    \"But as you used to supplement the motives of patriotism with the love  of glory, in order to stimulate the valor of your soldiers, so do we.  Based as our industrial system is on the principle of requiring the  same unit of effort from every man, that is, the best he can do, you  will see that the means by which we spur the workers to do their best  must be a very essential part of our scheme. With us, diligence in the  national service is the sole and certain way to public repute, social  distinction, and official power. The value of a man's services to  society fixes his rank in it. Compared with the effect of our social  arrangements in impelling men to be zealous in business, we deem the  object-lessons of biting poverty and wanton luxury on which you  depended a device as weak and uncertain as it was barbaric. The lust of  honor even in your sordid day notoriously impelled men to more  desperate effort than the love of money could.\"    \"I should be extremely interested,\" I said, \"to learn something of what  these social arrangements are.\"    \"The scheme in its details,\" replied the doctor, \"is of course very  elaborate, for it underlies the entire organization of our industrial  army; but a few words will give you a general idea of it.\"    At this moment our talk was charmingly interrupted by the emergence  upon the aerial platform where we sat of Edith Leete. She was dressed  for the street, and had come to speak to her father about some  commission she was to do for him.    \"By the way, Edith,\" he exclaimed, as she was about to leave us to  ourselves, \"I wonder if Mr. West would not be interested in visiting  the store with you? I have been telling him something about our system  of distribution, and perhaps he might like to see it in practical  operation.\"    \"My daughter,\" he added, turning to me, \"is an indefatigable shopper,  and can tell you more about the stores than I can.\"    The proposition was naturally very agreeable to me, and Edith being  good enough to say that she should be glad to have my company, we left  the house together.        Chapter 10    \"If I am going to explain our way of shopping to you,\" said my  companion, as we walked along the street, \"you must explain your way to  me. I have never been able to understand it from all I have read on the  subject. For example, when you had such a vast number of shops, each  with its different assortment, how could a lady ever settle upon any  purchase till she had visited all the shops? for, until she had, she  could not know what there was to choose from.\"    \"It was as you suppose; that was the only way she could know,\" I  replied.    \"Father calls me an indefatigable shopper, but I should soon be a very  fatigued one if I had to do as they did,\" was Edith's laughing comment.    \"The loss of time in going from shop to shop was indeed a waste which  the busy bitterly complained of,\" I said; \"but as for the ladies of the  idle class, though they complained also, I think the system was really  a godsend by furnishing a device to kill time.\"    \"But say there were a thousand shops in a city, hundreds, perhaps, of  the same sort, how could even the idlest find time to make their  rounds?\"    \"They really could not visit all, of course,\" I replied. \"Those who did  a great deal of buying, learned in time where they might expect to find  what they wanted. This class had made a science of the specialties of  the shops, and bought at advantage, always getting the most and best  for the least money. It required, however, long experience to acquire  this knowledge. Those who were too busy, or bought too little to gain  it, took their chances and were generally unfortunate, getting the  least and worst for the most money. It was the merest chance if persons  not experienced in shopping received the value of their money.\"    \"But why did you put up with such a shockingly inconvenient arrangement  when you saw its faults so plainly?\" Edith asked me.    \"It was like all our social arrangements,\" I replied. \"You can see  their faults scarcely more plainly than we did, but we saw no remedy  for them.\"    \"Here we are at the store of our ward,\" said Edith, as we turned in at  the great portal of one of the magnificent public buildings I had  observed in my morning walk. There was nothing in the exterior aspect  of the edifice to suggest a store to a representative of the nineteenth  century. There was no display of goods in the great windows, or any  device to advertise wares, or attract custom. Nor was there any sort of  sign or legend on the front of the building to indicate the character  of the business carried on there; but instead, above the portal,  standing out from the front of the building, a majestic life-size group  of statuary, the central figure of which was a female ideal of Plenty,  with her cornucopia.
