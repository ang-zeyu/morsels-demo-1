True the Prophet and several other brethren were technically held  for trial on {LI} the charge of \"treason, murder, arson, burglary,  robbery, larceny and perjury,\" but no one in Missouri ever seriously  believed the charges since they were wholly untrue or grew out of  those acts of self defense, and defense of their families against the  aggressions of mob violence--a course which all men have a right to  take in the protection of their own lives and the preservation of their  homes from the hand of the despoiler.    The meeting of discordant elements of society--New England people  and people from the Southern States, descendants of Puritans and  descendants of Cavaliers--may have been a cause of dislike, and, on  the part of the Missourians, a cause of irritation against the Saints;  the suspected existence of anti-slavery sentiments among the Saints  may have been to the Missourians a cause of distrust; the interest of  the Saints in the Indians and the beliefs of the former in the future  rehabilitation of the latter as a people favored of God, may have been,  under all the circumstances, a cause of uneasiness to the Missourians;  and the desire to plunder the Saints and to profit by dispossessing  them of their lands and homes might have been, and doubtless was, an  incentive to many of the mob who participated in the events which  culminated in the expulsion of the Saints from the state; but, at  bottom, I repeat, it was the destruction of the religion of the Saints,  and of the organization that taught its doctrines, and controlled its  membership in ecclesiastical affairs, that were the objectives of all  that agitation, violence and injustice, which make up the persecution  of the Latter-day Saints in Missouri. But how shall the truth of this  be established beyond reasonable doubt? Listen:--    The author of the \"_Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_\" gives  the following pen-picture of conditions with reference to religious  toleration which obtained in the empire under the reign of the  Antonines, Adrian and Marcus Aurelius, second century, A. D, \"The firm  edifice of Roman power was raised and preserved by the wisdom of ages.  The obedient provinces of Trajan and the Antonines were united by laws,  and adorned by arts. They might occasionally suffer from the partial  abuse of delegated authority; but the general principle of government  was wise, simple, and beneficent. They enjoyed the religion of their  ancestors, whilst in civil honors and advantages they were exalted, by  just degrees, to an equality with their conquerors. The policy of the  emperors and the senate, as far as it concerned religion, was happily  seconded by the reflections of the enlightened, and the habits of the  superstitious, part of their subjects. The various modes of worship,  which prevailed in the Roman world, were all considered by the people  as equally true; by the philosopher, as equally false; and by the  magistrate, as equally useful. And thus toleration produced not only  mutual indulgence, but even religious {LII} concord. The superstition  of the people was not embittered by any mixture of theological rancor;  nor was it confined by the chains of any speculative system. The devout  polytheist, though fondly attached to his national rites, admitted with  implicit faith the different religions of the earth. Fear, gratitude,  and curiosity, a dream or an omen, a singular disorder, or a distant  journey, perpetually disposed him to multiply the articles of his  belief, and to enlarge the list of his protectors. The thin texture  of the Pagan mythology was interwoven with various but not discordant  materials. As soon as it was allowed that sages and heroes, who had  lived or who had died for the benefit of their country, were exalted  to a state of power and immortality, it was universally confessed  that they deserved, if not the adoration, at least the reverence, of  all mankind. The deities of a thousand groves and a thousand streams  possessed in peace their local and respective influence: nor could  the Roman who deprecated the wrath of the Tiber, deride the Egyptian  who presented his offering to the beneficent genius of the Nile. The  visible powers of nature, the planets, and the elements, were the same  throughout the universe. The invisible governors of the moral world  were inevitably cast in a similar mould of fiction and allegory. Every  virtue, and even vice, acquired its divine representative; every art  and profession its patron, whose attributes, in the most distant ages  and countries, were uniformly derived from the character of their  peculiar votaries. A republic of gods of such opposite tempers and  interests required, in every system, the moderating hand of a supreme  magistrate, who, by the progress of knowledge and flattery, was  gradually invested with the sublime perfections of an eternal parent,  and an omnipotent monarch. Such was the mild spirit of antiquity,  that the nations were less attentive to the difference, than to the  resemblance, of their religious worship. The Greek, the Roman, and the  Barbarian, as they met before their respective altars, easily persuaded  themselves, that under various names, and with various ceremonies,  they adored the same deities. * * * * Rome, the capital of a great  monarchy, was incessantly filled with subjects and strangers from  every part of the world, who all introduced and enjoyed the favorite  superstitions of their native country. Every city in the empire was  justified in maintaining the purity of its ancient ceremonies; and  the Roman senate, using the common privilege, sometimes interposed to  check this inundation of foreign rites. The Egyptian superstition,  of all the most contemptible and abject, was frequently prohibited;  the temples of Serapis and Isis demolished, and their worshippers  banished from Rome and Italy. But the zeal of fanaticism prevailed  over the cold and feeble efforts of policy. The exiles returned, the  proselytes multiplied, the temples were restored with increasing {LIII}  splendor, and Isis and Serapis at length assumed their place among the  Roman deities. * * * * Rome gradually became the common temple of her  subjects; and the freedom of the city was bestowed on all the gods of  mankind.\" [44]    Some Christian editors of Gibbon's great work, in their annotations,  hold that the author of the \"Decline and Fall\" gives in the foregoing  a too favorable view of pagan religious toleration; but after giving  due weight to the instances of intolerance they cite in evidence of  their contention, and viewing them in connection with the extent of  the empire and the period of time covered by Gibbon's description, I  do not regard them as of sufficient importance to warrant any change  in the representation made by our author of conditions as to religious  toleration in the Roman empire at the time of which he writes.  Especially, since Gibbon himself in a foot note admits that \"some  obscure traces of an intolerant spirit appears in the conduct of the  Egyptians,\" the case chiefly relied upon by his critics to disprove his  description of universal religious toleration in the empire; and in  the same note he refers to the Christians and the Jews as forming an  important exception; so important an exception indeed that he promises,  and subsequently gives, a distinct chapter to the discussion of the  subject. [45]    It is to Christianity as the chief exception to the Roman policy of  universal religious toleration that I wish now to direct attention. Let  it be borne in mind that the spirit of universal religious toleration  within the Roman empire claimed for the second century of our era,  largely obtained also in the first century. It was in this reign  of universal religious toleration that the Christian religion was  brought forth and developed. Christ was born in the eighteenth year  of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, in the Roman province of Palestine,  in which, also, His personal labors as religious teacher and reformer  were chiefly confined. In the villages of Galilee, and subsequently in  Samaria and Judea and in the ancient city of Jerusalem, He went about  doing good; speaking words of encouragement to the oppressed and the  poor; healing the sick; opening the eyes of the blind; cleansing the  lepers; teaching, as no one ever taught before, the fatherhood of God,  the brotherhood of men, and proclaiming Himself the Son of God and the  Redeemer of the world. He gathered about Him a few devout followers,  and from their number He established a priesthood and organized a  Church to perpetuate the gentle doctrines He Himself taught. Strangely  enough, notwithstanding the beauty and purity of His moral precepts,  and the gentleness of His own deportment, proclamation of His doctrines  everywhere incited hostility. The people of the village in which He was  reared rejected Him. {LIV} His own people, the Jews, were so hostile  that they at last clamored for His execution; and so deep was their  hatred that they were willing that responsibility for the shedding  of His blood should be upon their heads and upon the heads of their  children after them, if only the Roman authorities would sanction His  execution! He was finally crucified amid the rejoicings of His enemies.    After His resurrection He appeared among His disciples and commissioned  them to evangelize the world. As they went about this work they  encountered the same spirit of opposition that had met their Master.  Whippings, imprisonment, and martyrdom confronted them on every hand,  and when they extended their labors beyond the borders of Palestine,  notwithstanding the general religious tolerance that obtained in the  Roman empire, the Christians were everywhere spoken against, and their  ministers everywhere opposed and persecuted.

The Saints took  advantage of the quietus, purchased a horse-mill and soon had it in  operation, and released the family graters.    But the peaceful interim was of short duration. It seemed that the  turbulent spirit had gained strength by the recess, and broke out with  redoubled fury. No Latter-day Saint was safe, and although our trust  was in God, and we felt assured of His protection, it was wise for us  to keep up a show of defence, as it had a tendency to awe our enemies.  To us it was a novel sight, and would have been ludicrous (were it not  painfully symptomatical of the situation) to see our venerable father  walking to meeting on the Sabbath, with a Bible in one hand and a  rifle in the other. At length an order was issued by the Governor of  the State, for all of the Saints to leave Daviess County within ten  days from date, the sixth of December, and a company of militia was  stationed in Di-Ahman, for that length of time, ostensibly to protect  us from the mob, but it was difficult to tell whether the mob or the  militia was most dangerous.    Before we left, the former owner of the place where we lived, came in,  and looking around very impudently, inquired how soon we would be out  of the house. It required an effort, but we suppressed our feelings of  indignation.    The weather was extremely cold, and the morning we bid adieu to our  honorably and honestly acquired transitory home, and much property  which we were obliged to leave, after assisting what I could, I started  before the teams, to warm my feet by walking. While musing on the  changing and wonderful vicissitudes of mortal life as I walked quietly  and alone, I was interrupted in my meditations by the approach of one  of the militia. After the usual salutations of \"Good morning,\" he said:  \"_I think this will cure you of your faith_.\" I looked him in the eye,  and, with emphasis, replied, \"No, sir, it will take more than this to  cure me of my faith.\" His countenance dropped, and he said, \"_Well, I  must confess you are a better soldier than I am_.\" And we parted.    It took two days to go by team to Far West, and seventy-five persons,  pilgrims like ourselves, put up at our stopping place for the night. It  was a small vacated log house of one room only, which was the general  nightly resort of people traveling from Di-Ahman to Far West. As we  found it, the chinkings between the logs had been torn out, leaving  open spaces through which gusts of wind had free play. When we arrived,  the provisions we brought were solidly frozen, and the crowd of people  was so dense, we could not avail ourselves of the fire. But we must  have supper, and we could not eat hard frozen bread, and we adopted the  following: The boys milked our cows, and before the milk was strained,  one of us held the dish while another sliced the bread, and the third  strained the warm milk into it, which thawed the bread; thus one after  another, until all were plentifully served.    Bed time came, but there was no room for beds, except for the sick,  and, indeed, there was very little sitting room. Our mother was quite  feeble through fatigue and exposure, and we managed to fix a place  for her to lie down, while our sister and myself sat on the floor,  one on each side, to ward off the crowd. I can well remember that  ever memorable night--how I dare not move lest I should disturb those  around me, so closely were we packed. And withal, it was a jolly time,  although with the majority, a sleepless night. Some ten or fifteen  feet from the house was a small horse shed, in the centre of which the  brethren built a roaring fire, and around it they stood, sometimes  dancing to keep warm, some roasting potatoes, while others parched  corn, and all joining in singing hymns and songs, merrily passing off  the hours till the morning dawn. Many started very early, which gave us  access to the fire for our morning meal.    Little would strangers, could they have witnessed those seventy-five  Saints, without knowing our circumstances; I say, little would they  have thought that we were exiles from our homes, going to seek among  strangers, abiding places for the winter, in an adjoining county, and  by order of the governor, leave the State and go we knew not where, in  the Spring. They would naturally have thought us a pleasure party.    On the fifth of March, 1839, after wintering seven miles from Far  West, in Caldwell County, we started _en route_ for Illinois, landing  in Quincy; we stopped there a short time, and from there our father  moved to Warren County, in the same State; from there to LaHarpe, where  Lorenzo found us, thence to Commerce, afterwards called Nauvoo.

I here record a  circumstance which occurred a short time previous--one which has been  riveted on my memory, never to be erased, so extraordinary was the  manifestation. At the time, I was at the house of Elder H. G. Sherwood;  he was endeavoring to explain the parable of our Savior, when speaking  of the husbandman who hired servants and sent them forth at different  hours of the day to labor in his vineyard.    While attentively listening to his explanation, the Spirit of the Lord  rested mightily upon me--the eyes of my understanding were opened, and  I saw as clear as the sun at noonday, with wonder and astonishment, the  pathway of God and man. I formed the following couplet which expresses  the revelation, as it was shown me, and explains Father Smith's dark  saying to me at a blessing meeting in the Kirtland Temple, prior to  my baptism, as previously mentioned in my first interview with the  Patriarch.      As man now is, God once was:    As God now is, man may be.    I felt this to be a sacred communication, which I related to no one  except my sister Eliza, until I reached England, when in a confidential  private conversation with President Brigham Young, in Manchester, I  related to him this extraordinary manifestation.    Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, and  others of the Quorum of the Twelve, nine in all, were at this time  laboring in England, and before leaving Nauvoo, the home of the Saints,  I visited several of their families. I found Sister Young occupying an  unfinished log hut, with a loose floor, and no chinking between the  logs; consequently the sides and ends of the hut were open, leaving  the inmates exposed to wind and storms. When I called, she had just  returned from a long, fatiguing and fruitless search for her milch  cow, which had strayed the day before, and on which she much depended  for sustenance for her little ones. On my asking her what she wished  me to say to her husband, she replied, \"You see my situation, but tell  him not to trouble, or worry in the least about me--I wish him to  remain in his field of labor until honorably released.\" Her apparent  poverty-stricken, destitute condition deeply stirred my sympathy. I  had but little money--not sufficient to take me one-tenth the distance  to my field of labor, with no prospect for obtaining the balance,  and was then on the eve of starting. I drew from my pocket a portion  of my small pittance, and presented her, but she refused to accept  it; while I strenuously insisted on her taking, and she persisting  to refuse--partly purposely, and partly accidentally, the money was  dropped on the floor, and rattled through the openings between the  loose boards, which settled the dispute, and bidding her good bye, I  left her to pick it up at her leisure. When I called on the wife of  Orson Pratt, she said she wished her husband to return home as soon as  possible--she needed his assistance.    On my way to New York, my point of embarkation, I called on my friends  in Ohio, held a few meetings, borrowed money at a heavy interest, and  proceeded on my way, traveling to New York chiefly on canal boats.  I took steerage passage on board a sailing vessel, having supplied  myself with blanket, buffalo robe, and a supply of provisions. I had  heard tell of deck passage--I had read of deck passage, but when I  experienced deck passage, with its peculiar make-up, on this voyage, I  could truly say, with the Queen of Sheba, \"the half had not been told;\"  and I felt assured that the other half never could be told. And, after  all, the almost unbearable discomfort I experienced on the voyage was  not attributable particularly to deck passage, but to the unpleasant  peculiarities of the situation. I was surrounded with a huddled crowd  of rough, uncouth people, very filthy in their appearance and habits.  We had a long passage of about six weeks, in which we encountered  storms and tempests, and suffered much for want of fresh water, and  also a sufficient supply of food. For further particulars I transcribe  the following letter written to my aunt in Ohio:    London, England, Feb. 16, 1841.    _My Dear and Highly Respected Aunt_:    With pleasure I improve the present opportunity in fulfilling the  promise made at our last interview. You see by this heading, I am in  the city of London, the great metropolis of the British empire. The  thought that I am between four and five thousand miles from the home  of my childhood and all of my early, fond associations, very naturally  prompts the question, _Why am I here_? To me, a question of no small  magnitude--one, the results of which probably lie far in the future. In  answer to the"]]]
