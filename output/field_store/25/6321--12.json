I went to her store every day, sometimes two or three times a day, and  she always had in her backroom, wine or something stronger to treat me  with, and in the evening I saw her at the hotel. When her mother came  back, and Margaret opened her house again, I was a constant visitor. I  was once more caught; I was in love.    Matters went on in this way for several weeks, when one evening I told  her that I was going next day to Troy on business, and she said she  wanted to go there to buy some goods, and that she would gladly take the  opportunity to go with me, if I would let her. Of course, I was only too  happy; and the next day I and my son, and she and one of the young women  in her employ, who was to assist her in selecting goods, started for  Troy. When I called for her, just as we were leaving the house, the old  lady, her mother, called out:    \"Margaret, don't you get married before you come back.\"    \"I guess I will,\" was Margaret's answer, and we went, a very jovial  party of four, to Troy and put up at the Girard House, where we had  dinner together, and drank a good deal of wine. After dinner my son and  myself went to attend to our business, she and her young woman going to  make their purchases, and arranging to meet us at a restaurant at half  past four o'clock, when we would lunch preparatory to returning to  Rutland.    We met at the appointed place and hour, and had a very lively lunch  indeed, an orgie in fact, with not only enough to eat, but altogether  too much to drink. I honestly think the two women could have laid me and  my son under the table, and would have done it, if we had not looked out  for ourselves; as it was, we all drank a great deal and were very merry.  We were in a room by ourselves, and when we had been there nearly an  hour, it occurred to Margaret that it would be a good idea to humor the  old lady's dry joke about the danger of our getting married during this  visit to Troy.    \"Henry,\" said she to my son; \"Go out and ask the woman who keeps the  saloon where you can get a blank marriage certificate, and then get one  and bring it here, and we'll have some fun.\"    We were all just drunk enough to see that there was a joke in it, and  we urged the boy to go. He went to the woman, who directed him to a  stationer's opposite, and presently he came in with a blank marriage  certificate. We called for pen and ink and he sat down and filled out  the blank form putting in my name and Margaret Bradley's, signing it  with some odd name I have forgotten as that of the clergyman performing  the ceremony. He then signed his own name as a witness to the marriage,  and the young woman who was with us also witnessed it with her  signature. We had a great deal of fun over it, then more wine, and then  it was time for us to hurry to the depot to take the six o'clock train  for Rutland.    Reaching home at about eleven o'clock at night, we found the old lady  up, and waiting for Margaret. We went in and Margaret's first words  were:    \"Well, mother! I'm married; I told you, you know, I thought I should be;  and here's my certificate.\"    The mother expressed no surprise--she knew her daughter better than  I did, then--but quietly congratulated her, while I said not a single  word. My son went to see his companion home, and, as I had not achieved  this latest greatness, but had it thrust upon me, I and my new found  \"wife\" went to our room. The next day I removed from the hotel to  Margaret's house and remained there during my residence in Rutland, she  introducing me to her friends as her husband, and seeming to consider it  an established fact.    Three weeks after this mock marriage, however, I told Margaret that I  was going to travel about the State a while to sell my medicines, and  that I might be absent for some time. She made no objections, and as I  was going with my own team she asked me to take some mantillas and a few  other goods which were a little out of fashion, and see if I could not  sell them for her. To be sure I would, and we parted on the best of  terms.    Behold rue now, not only a medical man and a marrying man, but also  a man milliner. When I could not dispose of my medicines, I tried  mantillas, and in the course of my tour I sold the whole of Margaret's  wares, faithfully remitting to her the money for the same. I think she  would have put her whole stock of goods on me to work off in the same  way; but I never gave her the opportunity to do so.    My journeying brought me at last to Montpelier where I proposed to stay  awhile and see if I could establish a practice. I had disposed of my  millinery goods and had nothing to attend to but my medicines--alas that  my professional acquirements as a marrying man should again have been  called in requisition. But it was to be. It was my fate to fall into the  hands of another milliner.    \"Insatiate monster! would not one suffice?\"    It seems not. There was a milliner at Rutland whose family and, friends  all believed to be my wife, though she knew she was not; and here in  Montpelier, was ready waiting, like a spider for a fly, another milliner  who was about to enmesh me in the matrimonial net. I had not been in  the place a week before I became acquainted with Eliza Gurnsey. I could  hardly help it, for she lived in the hotel where I stopped, and although  she was full thirty-five years old, she was altogether the most  attractive woman in the house. She was agreeable, good-looking,  intelligent, and what the vernacular calls \"smart.\" At all events, she  was much too smart for me, as I soon found out.    She had a considerable millinery establishment which she and her younger  sister carried on, employing several women, and she was reputed to  be well off. Strange as it may seem in the light of after events, she  actually belonged to the church and was a regular attendant at the  services. But no woman in town was more talked about, and precisely what  sort of a woman she was may be estimated from the fact that I had known  her but little more than a week, when she proposed that she, her sister  and I should go to Saratoga together, and have a good time for a day or  two.    I was fairly fascinated with the woman and I consented. The younger  sister was taken with us, I thought at first as a cover, I knew  afterwards as a confederate, and Eliza paid all the bills, which were  by no means small ones, of the entire trip. We stopped in Saratoga at a  hotel, which is now in very different hands, but which was then kept  by proprietors who, in addition to a most excellent table and  accommodations, afforded their guests the opportunity, if they desired  it, of attending prayers every night and morning in one of the parlors.  This may have been the inducement which made Eliza insist upon going to  this house, but I doubt it.    For our stay at Saratoga, three or four days, was one wild revel. We  rode about, got drunk, went to the Lake, came back to the hotel, and  the second day we were there, Eliza sent her sister for a Presbyterian  minister, whose address she had somehow secured, and this minister came  to the hotel and married us. I presume I consented, I don't know, for I  was too much under the effect of liquor to know much of anything. I have  an indistinct recollection of some sort of a ceremony, and afterwards  Eliza showed me a certificate--no Troy affair, but a genuine document  signed by a minister residing in Saratoga, and witnessed by her sister  and some one in the hotel who had been called in. But the whole was like  a dream to me; it was the plot of an infamous woman to endeavor to make  herself respectable by means of a marriage, no matter to whom or how  that marriage was effected.    Meanwhile, the Montpelier papers had the whole story, one of them  publishing a glowing account of my elopement with Miss Gurnsey, and the  facts of our marriage at Saratoga was duly chronicled. This paper fell  into the hands of Miss Bradley, at Rutland, and as she claimed to be my  wife, and had parted with me only a little while before, when I went  out to peddle medicines and millinery, her feelings can be imagined. She  read the story and then aroused all Rutland. I had not been back from  Saratoga half an hour before I was arrested in the public house in  Montpelier and taken before a magistrate, on complaint of Miss Bradley,  of Rutland, that I was guilty of bigamy.    The examination was a long one, and as the facts which were then shown  appeared afterwards in my trial they need not be noted now. I had two  first-rate lawyers, but for all that, and with the plainest showing  that Margaret Bradley had no claim whatever to be considered my wife, I  was bound over in the sum of three thousand dollars to appear for  trial, and was sent to jail. There was a tremendous excitement about the  matter, and the whole town seemed interested.    To jail I went, Eliza going with me, and insisting upon staying; but the  jailer would not let her, nor was she permitted to visit me during my  entire stay there, at least she got in to see me but once. I made  every effort to get bail, but was unsuccessful. Eight long weary months  elapsed before my trial came on, and all this while I was in jail. My  trial lasted a week. The Bradley woman knew she was no more married to  me than she was to the man in the moon; but she swore stoutly that we  were actually wedded according to the certificate. On the other hand,  my son swore to all the facts about the Troy spree, and his buying and  filling out the certificate, which showed for itself that, excepting the  signature of the young woman who also witnessed it, it was entirely in  Henry's handwriting. I should have got along well enough so far as  the Bradley woman was concerned; but the prosecution had been put in  possession of all the facts relative to my first "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4671"],[0,"The Story of the Pony Express (#13)"],[1,"and Connelley's Overland Stage to California.          Chapter VIII    Early Overland Mail Routes      In the history of overland transportation in America, the Pony Express  is but one in a series of many enterprises. As emphasized at the  beginning of this book, its importance lay in its opportuneness; in the  fact that it appeared at the psychological moment, and fitted into the  course of events at a critical period, prior to the completion of the  telegraph; and when some form of rapid transit between the Missouri  River and the Pacific Coast was absolutely needed. To give adequate  setting to this story, a brief account of the leading overland routes,  of which the Pony Express was but one, seems proper.    Before the middle of the nineteenth century, three great thoroughfares  had been established from the Missouri, westward across the continent.  These were the Santa Fe, the Salt Lake, and the Oregon trails. All had  important branches and lesser stems, and all are today followed by  important railroads--a splendid testimonial to the ability of the  pioneer pathfinders in selecting the best routes.    Of these trails, that leading to Santa Fe was the oldest, having been  fully established before 1824. The Salt Lake and Oregon routes date some  twenty years later, coming into existence in the decade between 1840 and  1850. It is incidentally with the Salt Lake trail that the story of the  Pony Express mainly deals.    The Mormon settlement of Utah in 1847-48, followed almost immediately by  the discovery of gold in California, led to the first mail route[34]  across the country, west of the Missouri. This was known as the \"Great  Salt Lake Mail,\" and the first contract for transporting it was let July  1, 1850, to Samuel H. Woodson of Independence, Missouri. By terms of  this agreement, Woodson was to haul the mail monthly from Independence  on the Missouri River to Salt Lake City, twelve hundred miles, and  return. Woodson later arranged with some Utah citizens to carry a mail  between Salt Lake City and Fort Laramie, the service connecting with the  Independence mail at the former place. This supplementary line was put  into operation August 1, 1851.    In the early fifties, while the California gold craze was still on, a  monthly route was laid out between Sacramento and Salt Lake City[35].  This service was irregular and unreliable; and since the growing  population of California demanded a direct overland route, a four year  monthly contract was granted to W. F. McGraw, a resident of Maryland.  His subsidy from Congress was $13,500.00 a year. In those days it often  took a month to get mail from Independence to Salt Lake City, and about  six weeks for the entire trip. Although McGraw charged $180.00 fare for  each passenger to Salt Lake City, and $300.00 to California, he failed,  in 1856. The unexpired contract was then let to the Mormon firm of  Kimball & Co., and they kept the route in operation until the Mormon  troubles of 1857 when the Government abrogated the agreement.    In the summer of 1857, General Albert Sidney Johnston, later of Civil  War fame, was sent out with a Federal army of five thousand men to  invade Utah. After a rather fruitless campaign, Johnston wintered at  Fort Bridger, in what is southwestern Wyoming, not far from the Utah  line. During this interval, army supplies were hauled from Fort  Leavenworth with only a few way stations for changing teams. This  improvised line, carrying mail occasionally, which went over the old  Mormon trail via South Pass, and Forts Kearney, Laramie, and Bridger,  was for many months the only service available for this entire region.    The next contract for getting mail into Utah was let in 1858 to John M.  Hockaday of Missouri. Johnston's army was then advancing from winter  quarters at Bridger toward the valley of Great Salt Lake, and the  Government wanted mail oftener then once a month. In consideration of  $190,000.00 annually which was to be paid in monthly installments,  Hockaday agreed to put on a weekly mail. This route, which ran from St.  Joseph to Salt Lake City, was later combined with a line that had been  running from Salt Lake to Sacramento, thus making a continuous weekly  route to and from California. For the combined route the Government paid  $320,000.00 annually. Its actual yearly receipts were $5,142.03.    The discovery of gold in the vicinity of Denver in the summer of 1858  caused another wild excitement and a great rush which led to the  establishment in the summer of 1859 of the Leavenworth and Pike's Peak  Express, from the Missouri to Denver. As then traveled, this route was  six hundred and eighty-seven miles in length. The line as operated by  Russell, Majors, and Waddell, and that same year they took over  Hockaday's business. As has already been stated, the new firm of Pony  Express fame--called the Central Overland California and Pike's Peak  Express Co.--consolidated the old California line, which had been run  in two sections, East and West, with the Denver line. In addition to the  Pony Express it carried on a big passenger and freighting business to  and from Denver and California.    Turning now to the lines that were placed in commission farther South.  The first overland stage between Santa Fe and Independence was started  in May, 1849. This was also a monthly service, and by 1850 it was fully  equipped with the famous Concord coaches, which vehicles were soon to be  used on every overland route in the West. Within five years, this route,  which was eight hundred fifty miles in length and followed the Santa Fe  trail, now the route of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe railroad, had  attained great importance. The Government finally awarded it a yearly  subsidy of $10,990.00, but as the trail had little or no military  protection except at Fort Union, New Mexico, and for hundreds of miles  was exposed to the attacks of prairie Indians, the contractors  complained because of heavy losses and sought relief of the Post Office  and War Departments. Finally they were released from their old contract  and granted a new one paying $25,000.00 annually, but even then they  fell behind $5,000.00 per year.    By special act passed August 3, 1854, Congress laid out a monthly mail  route from Neosho, Missouri, to Albuquerque, New Mexico, with an annual  subsidy of $17,000.00. Since the Mexican War this region had come to be  of great commercial and military importance. A little later, in March  1855, the route was changed by the Government to run monthly from  Independence and Kansas City, Missouri, to Stockton, California, via  Albuquerque, and the contractors were awarded a yearly bonus of  $80,000.00 This line was also a financial failure.    The early overland routes were granted large subsidies and the privilege  of charging high rates for passengers and freight. To the casual  observer it may seem strange that practically all these lines operated  at a disastrous loss. It should be noted however, that they covered an  immense territory, many portions of which were occupied by hostile  Indians. It is no easy task to move military forces and supplies  thousands of miles through a wilderness. Furthermore, the Indians were  elusive and hard to find when sought by a considerable force. They  usually managed to attack when and where they were least expected.  Consequently, if protection were secured at all, it usually fell to the  lot of the stage companies to police their own lines, which was  expensive business. Often they waged, single-handed, Indian campaigns of  considerable importance, and the frontiersmen whom they could assemble  for such duty were sometimes more effective than the soldiers who were  unfamiliar with the problems of Indian warfare.    Added to these difficulties were those incident to severe weather, deep  snow, and dangerous streams, since regular highways and bridges were  almost unknown in the regions traversed. Not to mention the handicap and  expense which all these natural obstacles entailed, business on many  lines was light, and revenues low.    News from Washington about the creation of the new territory of Utah--in  September 1850--was not received in Salt Lake City until January  1851. The report reached Utah by messenger from California, having come  around the continent by way of the Isthmus of Panama. The winters of  1851-52, and 1852-53 were frightfully severe and such expensive delays  were not uncommon. The November mail of 1856 was compelled to winter in  the mountains.    In the winter of 1856-57 no steady service could be maintained between  Salt Lake City and Missouri on account of bad weather. Finally, after a  long delay, the postmaster at Salt Lake City contracted with the local  firm of Little, Hanks, and Co., to get a special mail to and from  Independence. This was accomplished, but the ordeal required  seventy-eight days, during which men and animals suffered terribly from  cold and hunger. The firm received $1,500.00 for its trouble. The Salt  Lake route returned to the Government a yearly income of only $5,000.00.    The route from Independence to Stockton, which cost Uncle Sam $80,000.00  a year, collected in nine months only $1,255.00 in postal revenues,  whereupon it was abolished July 1st, 1859.    By the close of 1859 there were at least six different mail routes  across the continent from the Missouri to the Pacific Coast. They were  costing the Government a total of $2,184,696.00 and returning  $339,747.34. The most expensive of these lines was the New York and New  Orleans Steamship Company route, which ran semi-monthly from New York to  San Francisco via Panama. This service cost $738,250.00 annually and  brought in $229,979.69. While the steamship people did not have the  frontier dangers to confront them, they were operating over a roundabout  course, several thousand miles in extent, and the volume of their postal  business was simply"]]]
