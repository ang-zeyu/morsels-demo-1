This little diary in which he wrote down his most secret thoughts and  prayers was kept \"for himself alone,\" and he never showed it to any one.  I saw it after my father's death. It is impossible to read it without  tears.    It is curious that the sudden decay of my father's memory displayed  itself only in the matter of real facts and people. He was entirely  unaffected in his literary work, and everything that he wrote down to  the last days of his life is marked by his characteristic logicalness  and force. It may be that the reason he forgot the details of real life  was because he was too deeply absorbed in his abstract work.    My wife was at Yasnaya Polyana in October, and when she came home she  told me that there was something wrong there. \"Your mother is nervous  and hysterical; your father is in a silent and gloomy frame of mind.\"    I was very busy with my office work, but made up my mind to devote my  first free day to going and seeing my father and mother.    When I got to Yasnaya, my father had already left it.    I paid Aunt Masha a visit some little time after my father's funeral. We  sat together in her comfortable little cell, and she repeated to me once  more in detail the oft-repeated story of my father's last visit to her.    \"He sat in that very arm-chair where you are sitting now, and how he  cried!\" she said.    \"When Sasha arrived with her girl friend, they set to work studying this  map of Russia and planning out a route to the Caucasus. Lyovotchka sat  there thoughtful and melancholy.    \"'Never mind, Papa; it'll be all right,' said Sasha, trying to encourage  him.    \"'Ah, you women, you women!' answered her father, bitterly. 'How can it  ever be all right?'    \"I so much hoped that he would settle down here; it would just have  suited him. And it was his own idea, too; he had even taken a cottage in  the village,\" Aunt Masha sadly recalled.    \"When he left me to go back to the hotel where he was staying, it seemed  to me that he was rather calmer.    \"When he said good-by, he even made some joke about his having come to  the wrong door.    \"I certainly would never have imagined that he would go away again that  same night.\"    It was a grievous trial for Aunt Masha when the old confessor Iosif,  who was her spiritual director, forbade her to pray for her dead brother  because he had been excommunicated. She was too broad-minded to be able  to reconcile herself to the harsh intolerance of the church, and for a  time she was honestly indignant. Another priest to whom she applied also  refused her request.    Marya Nikolayevna could not bring herself to disobey her spiritual  fathers, but at the same time she felt that she was not really obeying  their injunction, for she prayed for him all the same, in thought, if  not in words.    There is no knowing how her internal discord would have ended if her  father confessor, evidently understanding the moral torment she was  suffering, had not given her permission to pray for her brother, but  only in her cell and in solitude, so as not to lead others astray.          MY FATHER'S WILL. CONCLUSION    ALTHOUGH my father had long since renounced the copyright in all his  works written after 1883, and although, after having made all his real  estate over to his children, he had, as a matter of fact, no property  left, still he could not but be aware that his life was far from  corresponding to his principles, and this consciousness perpetually  preyed upon his mind. One has only to read some of his posthumous works  attentively to see that the idea of leaving home and radically altering  his whole way of life had presented itself to him long since and was a  continual temptation to him.    This was the cherished dream that always allured him, but which he did  not think himself justified in putting into practice.    The life of the Christian must be a \"reasonable and happy life IN  ALL POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES,\" he used to say as he struggled with the  temptation to go away, and gave up his own soul for others.    I remember reading in Gusef's memoirs how my father once, in  conversation with Gusoryof, the peasant, who had made up his mind  to leave his home for religious reasons, said, \"My life is a hundred  thousand times more loathsome than yours, but yet I cannot leave it.\"    I shall not enumerate all the letters of abuse and amazement which  my father received from all sides, upbraiding him with luxury, with  inconsistency, and even with torturing his peasants. It is easy to  imagine what an impression they made on him.    He said there was good reason to revile him; he called their abuse \"a  bath for the soul,\" but internally he suffered from the \"bath,\" and saw  no way out of his difficulties. He bore his cross, and it was in this  self-renunciation that his power consisted, though many either could not  or would not understand it. He alone, despite all those about him, knew  that this cross was laid on him not of man, but of God; and while he was  strong, he loved his burden and shared it with none.    Just as thirty years before he had been haunted by the temptation to  suicide, so now he struggled with a new and more powerful temptation,  that of flight.    A few days before he left Yasnaya he called on Marya Alexandrovna  Schmidt at Ovsyanniki and confessed to her that he wanted to go away.    The old lady held up her hands in horror and said:    \"Gracious Heavens, Lyoff Nikolaievich, have you come to such a pitch of  weakness?\"    When I learned, on October 28, 1910, that my father had left Yasnaya,  the same idea occurred to me, and I even put it into words in a letter I  sent to him at Shamerdino by my sister Sasha.    I did not know at the time about certain circumstances which have since  made a great deal clear to me that was obscure before.    From the moment of my father's death till now I have been racking my  brains to discover what could have given him the impulse to take that  last step. What power could compel him to yield in the struggle in which  he had held firmly and tenaciously for many years? What was the last  drop, the last grain of sand that turned the scales, and sent him forth  to search for a new life on the very edge of the grave?    Could he really have fled from home because the wife that he had lived  with for forty-eight years had developed neurasthenia and at one time  showed certain abnormalities characteristic of that malady? Was that  like the man who so loved his fellows and so well knew the human heart?  Or did he suddenly desire, when he was eighty-three, and weak and  helpless, to realize the idea of a pilgrim's life?    If so, why did he take my sister Sasha and Dr. Makowicki with him?  He could not but know that in their company he would be just as well  provided with all the necessaries of life as he would have been at  Yasnaya Polyana. It would have been the most palpable self-deception.    Knowing my father as I did, I felt that the question of his flight was  not so simple as it seemed to others, and the problem lay long unsolved  before me until it was suddenly made clear by the will that he left  behind him.    I remember how, after N. S. Leskof's death, my father read me his  posthumous instructions with regard to a pauper funeral, with no  speeches at the grave, and so on, and how the idea of writing his own  will then came into his head for the first time.    His first will was written in his diary, on March 27, 1895. [27]    The fourth paragraph, to which I wish to call particular attention,  contains a request to his next of kin to transfer the right of  publishing his writings to society at large, or, in other words, to  renounce the copyright of them.    \"But I only request it, and do not direct it. It is a good thing to do.  And it will be good for you to do it; but if you do not do it, that is  your affair. It means that you are not yet ready to do it. The fact that  my writings have been bought and sold during these last ten years has  been the most painful thing in my whole life to me.\"    Three copies were made of this will, and they were kept by my sister  Masha, my brother Sergei, and Tchertkof.    I knew of its existence, but I never saw it till after my father's  death, and I never inquired of anybody about the details.    I knew my father's views about copyright, and no will of his could have  added anything to what I knew. I knew, moreover, that this will was not  properly executed according to the forms of law, and personally I was  glad of that, for I saw in it another proof of my father's confidence  in his family. I need hardly add that I never doubted that my father's  wishes would be carried out.    My sister Masha, with whom I once had a conversation on the subject, was  of the same opinion.    In 1909 my father stayed with Mr. Tchertkof at Krekshin, and there for  the first time he wrote a formal will, attested by the signature of  witnesses. How this will came to be written I do not know, and I do not  intend to discuss it. It afterward appeared that it also was imperfect  from a legal point of view, and in October, 1909, it had all to be done  again.    As to the writing of the third we are fully informed by Mr. F. Strakhof  in an article which he published in the St. Petersburg \"Gazette\" on  November 6, 1911.    Mr. Strakhof left Moscow at night. He had calculated on Sofya  Andreyevna, [28] whose presence at Yasnaya Polyana was highly  inexpedient for the business on which he was bound, being still in  Moscow.    The business in question, as was made clear in the preliminary  consultation which V. G. Tchertkof held with N. K. Muravyof,  the solicitor, consisted in getting fresh signatures from Lyoff  Nikolaievich, whose great age made it desirable to make sure, without  delay, of his wishes being carried out by means of a more unassailable  legal document. Strakhof brought the draft of the will with him, and  laid it before Lyoff"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8159"],[0,"Wanderings in South America (#13)"],[1,"Brazil. There is little at this time of the year, in the European part  of the Atlantic, to engage the attention of the naturalist. As you go  down the Channel you see a few divers and gannets. The middle-sized  gulls, with a black spot at the end of the wings, attend you a little  way into the Bay of Biscay. When it blows a hard gale of wind the  stormy petrel makes its appearance. While the sea runs mountains high,  and every wave threatens destruction to the labouring vessel, this  little harbinger of storms is seen enjoying itself, on rapid pinion, up  and down the roaring billows. When the storm is over it appears no  more. It is known to every English sailor by the name of Mother Carey's  chicken. It must have been hatched in AEolus's cave, amongst a clutch of  squalls and tempests, for whenever they get out upon the ocean it  always contrives to be of the party.    Though the calms and storms and adverse winds in these latitudes are  vexatious, still, when you reach the trade-winds, you are amply repaid  for all disappointments and inconveniences. The trade-winds prevail  about thirty degrees on each side of the equator. This part of the  ocean may be called the Elysian Fields of Neptune's empire; and the  torrid zone, notwithstanding Ovid's remark, \"non est habitabilis aestu,\"  is rendered healthy and pleasant by these gently-blowing breezes. The  ship glides smoothly on, and you soon find yourself within the northern  tropic. When you are on it Cancer is just over your head, and betwixt  him and Capricorn is the high-road of the Zodiac, forty-seven degrees  wide, famous for Phaeton's misadventure. His father begged and  entreated him not to take it into his head to drive parallel to the  five zones, but to mind and keep on the turnpike which runs obliquely  across the equator. \"There you will distinctly see,\" said he, \"the ruts  of my chariot wheels, 'manifesta rotae vestigia cernes.'\" \"But,\" added  he, \"even suppose you keep on it, and avoid the by-roads, nevertheless,  my dear boy, believe me, you will be most sadly put to your shifts;  'ardua prima via est,' the first part of the road is confoundedly  steep! 'ultima via prona est,' and after that, it is all down-hill!  Moreover, 'per insidias iter est, formasque ferarum,' the road is full  of nooses and bull-dogs, 'Haemoniosque arcus,' and spring guns, 'saevaque  circuitu, curvantem brachia longo, Scorpio,' and steel traps of  uncommon size and shape.\" These were nothing in the eyes of Phaeton; go  he would, so off he set, full speed, four in hand. He had a tough drive  of it, and after doing a prodigious deal of mischief, very luckily for  the world he got thrown out of the box, and tumbled into the River Po.    Some of our modern bloods have been shallow enough to try to ape this  poor empty-headed coachman on a little scale, making London their  Zodiac. Well for them if tradesmen's bills and other trivial  perplexities have not caused them to be thrown into the King's Bench.    The productions of the torrid zone are uncommonly grand. Its plains,  its swamps, its savannas and forests abound with the largest serpents  and wild beasts; and its trees are the habitation of the most beautiful  of the feathered race. While the traveller in the Old World is  astonished at the elephant, the tiger, the lion and rhinoceros, he who  wanders through the torrid regions of the New is lost in admiration at  the cotingas, the toucans, the humming-birds and aras.    The ocean likewise swarms with curiosities. Probably the flying-fish  may be considered as one of the most singular. This little scaled  inhabitant of water and air seems to have been more favoured than the  rest of its finny brethren. It can rise out of the waves and on wing  visit the domain of the birds.    After flying two or three hundred yards, the intense heat of the sun  has dried its pellucid wings, and it is obliged to wet them in order to  continue its flight. It just drops into the ocean for a moment, and  then rises again and flies on; and then descends to remoisten them, and  then up again into the air; thus passing its life, sometimes wet,  sometimes dry, sometimes in sunshine, and sometimes in the pale moon's  nightly beam, as pleasure dictates or as need requires. The additional  assistance of wings is not thrown away upon it. It has full occupation  both for fins and wings, as its life is in perpetual danger.    The bonito and albicore chase it day and night, but the dolphin is its  worst and swiftest foe. If it escape into the air, the dolphin pushes  on with proportional velocity beneath, and is ready to snap it up the  moment it descends to wet its wings.    You will often see above one hundred of these little marine aerial  fugitives on the wing at once. They appear to use every exertion to  prolong their flight, but vain are all their efforts, for when the last  drop of water on their wings is dried up their flight is at an end, and  they must drop into the ocean. Some are instantly devoured by their  merciless pursuer, part escape by swimming, and others get out again as  quick as possible, and trust once more to their wings.    It often happens that this unfortunate little creature, after alternate  dips and flights, finding all its exertions of no avail, at last drops  on board the vessel, verifying the old remark:      Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim.    There, stunned by the fall, it beats the deck with its tail and dies.  When eating it you would take it for a fresh herring. The largest  measure from fourteen to fifteen inches in length. The dolphin, after  pursuing it to the ship, sometimes forfeits his own life.    In days of yore the musician used to play in softest, sweetest strain,  and then take an airing amongst the dolphins: \"inter delphinas Arion.\"  But nowadays our tars have quite capsized the custom, and instead of  riding ashore on the dolphin, they invite the dolphin aboard. While he  is darting and playing around the vessel a sailor goes out to the  spritsail yard-arm, and with a long staff, leaded at one end, and armed  at the other with five barbed spikes, he heaves it at him. If  successful in his aim there is a fresh mess for all hands. The dying  dolphin affords a superb and brilliant sight:      Mille trahit moriens, adverse sole colores.    All the colours of the rainbow pass and repass in rapid succession over  his body, till the dark hand of death closes the scene.    From the Cape de Verd Islands to the coast of Brazil you see several  different kinds of gulls, which, probably, are bred in the Island of  St. Paul. Sometimes the large bird called the frigate pelican soars  majestically over the vessel, and the tropic bird comes near enough to  let you have a fair view of the long feathers in his tail. On the line,  when it is calm, sharks of a tremendous size make their appearance.  They are descried from the ship by means of the dorsal fin, which is  above the water.    On entering the Bay of Pernambuco, the frigate pelican is seen watching  the shoals of fish from a prodigious height. It seldom descends without  a successful attack on its numerous prey below.    As you approach the shore the view is charming. The hills are clothed  with wood, gradually rising towards the interior, none of them of any  considerable height. A singular reef of rocks runs parallel to the  coast and forms the harbour of Pernambuco. The vessels are moored  betwixt it and the town, safe from every storm. You enter the harbour  through a very narrow passage, close by a fort built on the reef. The  hill of Olinda, studded with houses and convents, is on your  right-hand, and an island thickly planted with cocoa-nut trees adds  considerably to the scene on your left. There are two strong forts on  the isthmus betwixt Olinda and Pernambuco, and a pillar midway to aid  the pilot.    Pernambuco probably contains upwards of fifty thousand souls. It stands  on a flat, and is divided into three parts: a peninsula, an island and  the continent. Though within a few degrees of the line, its climate is  remarkably salubrious and rendered almost temperate by the refreshing  sea-breeze. Had art and judgment contributed their portion to its  natural advantages, Pernambuco at this day would have been a stately  ornament to the coast of Brazil. On viewing it, it will strike you that  everyone has built his house entirely for himself, and deprived public  convenience of the little claim she had a right to put in. You would  wish that this city, so famous for its harbour, so happy in its climate  and so well situated for commerce, could have risen under the flag of  Dido, in lieu of that of Braganza.    As you walk down the streets the appearance of the houses is not much  in their favour. Some of them are very high, and some very low; some  newly whitewashed, and others stained and mouldy and neglected, as  though they had no owner.    The balconies, too, are of a dark and gloomy appearance. They are not,  in general, open as in most tropical cities, but grated like a farmer's  dairy-window, though somewhat closer.    There is a lamentable want of cleanliness in the streets. The  impurities from the houses and the accumulation of litter from the  beasts of burden are unpleasant sights to the passing stranger. He  laments the want of a police as he goes along, and when the wind begins  to blow his nose and eyes are too often exposed to a cloud of very  unsavoury dust.    When you view the port of Pernambuco, full of ships of all nations;  when you know that the richest commodities of Europe, Africa and Asia  are brought to it; when you see immense quantities of cotton, dye-wood  and the choicest fruits pouring into the town, you are apt to wonder at  the little attention these people pay to the common comforts which one  always expects to find in a large and opulent city. However, if the  inhabitants are satisfied, there is nothing more to be said. Should  they ever be"]]]
