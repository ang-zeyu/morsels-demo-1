Why couldn't he take a train, or an  auto?\"    \"Well, we don't know all the ins and outs,\" admitted Tom. \"Taking  a midnight airship ride is rather strange, but that may have been  the only course open. We'll have to let the explanation go until  later. At any rate, Mrs. Damon, I feel sure that your husband did  go off through the air--either in my Eagle or in some other  craft.\"    \"Well, I'm glad to hear you say so, Tom Swift, though it sounds a  dreadful thing to say. But if he did go off of his own accord, I  know he did it for the best. And he may not have told me, for fear  I would worry. I can understand that. But why isn't he back now?\"    Tom had been rather dreading that question. It was one he had  asked himself, and he had found no good answer for it. If there  had been such need of haste, that an airship had to be used, why  had not Mr. Damon come back ere this? Unless, as Tom feared to  admit, even to himself, there had been some accident.    Half a dozen theories flashed through his mind, but he could not  select a good, working one,--particularly as there were no clues.  Disappearing in an airship was the one best means of not leaving a  trace behind. An auto, a motor boat, a train, a horse and  carriage--all these could be more or less easily traced. But an  airship--    If Mr. Damon wanted to cover up his tracks, or if he had been  taken away, and his captors wanted to baffle pursuit, the best  means had been adopted.    \"Now don't you worry,\" advised Tom to Mrs. Damon. \"I know it looks  funny, but I think it will come out all right. Ned and I will do  all we can. Mr. Damon must have known what he was about. But, to  be on the safe side, we'll send out a general alarm through the  police.\"    \"Oh, I don't know what I'd done if you hadn't come to help me!\"  exclaimed Mrs. Damon.    \"Just you leave it to me!\" said the young inventor, cheerfully.  \"I'll find Mr. Damon!\"    But, though he spoke thus confidently, Tom Swift had not the  slightest notion, just then, of how to set about his difficult  task. He had had hard problems to solve before, so he was not  going to give up this one. First he wanted to think matters out,  and arrange a plan of action.    He and Ned made a careful examination of the grounds of the Damon  homestead. There was little they could learn, though they did find  where an airship had landed in a meadow, not far away, and where  it had made a flying start off again.    Carefully Tom looked at the marks made by the wheels of the  airship.    \"They're the same distance apart as those on the Eagle,\" he said  to his chum, \"and the tires are the same. But that isn't saying  anything, as lots of airships have the same equipment. So we won't  jump to any conclusions that way.\"    Tom and Ned interviewed several of the neighbors, but beyond  learning that some of them had heard the throbbing of the midnight  airship, that was as far as they got on that line.    There was nothing more they could do in Waterford, and, leaving  Mrs. Damon, who had summoned a relative to stay with her, the two  chums made a quick trip back through the air to Shopton. As  Eradicate came out to help put away the monoplane Tom noticed that  the colored man was holding one hand as though it hurt him.    \"What's the matter, Rad?\" asked the young investor.    \"Oh, nuffin--jest natcherly nuffin, Massa Tom.\"    But Eradicate spoke evasively and in a manner that roused Tom's  suspicions.    \"Boomerang, your mule, didn't kick you; did he?\"    \"No, sah, Massa Tom, no sah. 'Twern't nuffin laik dat.\"    \"But what was it? Your hand is hurt!\"    \"Well, Massa Tom, I s'pose I done bettah tell yo' all. I'se had a  shock!\"    \"A shock?\"    \"Yas, sah. A shock. A lickrish shock.\"    \"Oh, you mean an electrical shock. That's too bad. I suppose you  must have touched a live wire.\"    \"No, sah. 'Twern't dat way.\"    \"How was it, then?\"    \"Well, yo' see, Massa Tom, I were playin' a joke on Koku.\"    \"Oh, you were; eh? Then I suppose Koku shocked you,\" laughed Tom.    \"No, sah. I--I'll tell you. Dat giant man he were in de telefoam  boof in de pattern shop--you know--de one where yo' all been  tryin' to make pishures.\"    \"Yes, I know. Go on!\" exclaimed Tom, impatiently.    \"Well, he were in dere, Massa Tom, an' I slipped into de boof in  de next shop--de odder place where yo' all been 'speermentin'. I  called out on de telefoam, loud laik de Angel Gabriel gwine t'  holler at de last trump: 'Look out, yo' ole sinnah!' I yell it  jest t' scare Koku.\"    \"I see,\" said Tom, a bit severely, for he did not like Eradicate  interfering with the instruments. \"And did you scare Koku?\"    \"Oh, yas, sah, Massa Tom. I skeered him all right; but suffin else  done happen. When I put down de telefoam I got a terrible shock.  It hurts yit!\"    \"Well,\" remarked Tom, \"I suppose I ought to feel sorry for you,  but I can't. You should let things alone. Now I've got to see if  you did any damage. Come along, Ned.\"    Tom was the first to enter the telephone booth where Eradicate had  played the part of the Angel Gabriel. He looked at the wires and  apparatus, but could see nothing wrong.    Then he glanced at the selenium plate, on which he hoped, some  day, to imprint an image from over the wire. And, as he saw the  smooth surface he started, and cried.    \"Ned! Ned, come here quick!\"    \"What is it?\" asked his chum, crowding into the booth.    \"Look at that plate! Tell me what you see!\"    Ned looked.    \"Why--why it's Koku's picture!\" he gasped.    \"Exactly!\" cried Tom. \"In some way my experiment has succeeded  when I was away. Eradicate must have made some new connection by  his monkeying. Ned, it's a success! I've got my first photo  telephone picture! Hurray!\"            CHAPTER XIV    MAKING IMPROVEMENTS      Tom Swift was so overjoyed and excited that for a few moments he  capered about, inside the booth, and outside, knocking against his  chum Ned, clapping him on the back, and doing all manner of boyish  \"stunts.\"    \"It's a success, Ned! I've struck it!\" cried Tom, in delight.    \"Ouch! You struck ME, you mean!\" replied Ned, rubbing his  shoulder, where the young inventor had imparted a resounding blow  of joy.    \"What of it?\" exclaimed Tom. \"My apparatus works! I can send a  picture by telephone! It's great, Ned!\"    \"But I don't exactly understand how it happened,\" said Ned, in  some bewilderment, as he gazed at the selenium plate.    \"Neither do I,\" admitted Tom, when he had somewhat calmed down.  \"That is, I don't exactly understand what made the thing succeed  now, when it wouldn't work for me a little while ago. But I've got  to go into that. I'll have to interview that rascal Eradicate, and  learn what he did when he played that trick on Koku. Yes, and I'll  have to see Koku, too. We've got to get at the bottom of this,  Ned.\"    \"I suppose so. You've got your hands full, Tom, with your photo  telephone, and the disappearance of Mr. Damon.\"    \"Yes, and my own airship, too. I must get after that. Whew! A lot  of things to do! But I like work, Ned. The more the better.\"    \"Yes, that's like you, Tom. But what are you going to get at  first?\"    \"Let me see; the telephone, I think. I'll have Rad and Koku in  here and talk to them. I say, you Eradicate!\" he called out of the  door of the shop, as he saw the colored man going past, holding  his shocked arm tenderly.    \"Yas, sah, Massa Tom, I'se comin'! What is it yo' all wants, Massa  Tom?\"    \"I want you to show me exactly what you did to the wires, and  other things in here, when you played that Angel Gabriel trick on  your partner Koku.\"    \"Partner! He ain't mah partner!\" exclaimed Eradicate with a scowl,  for there was not the best of feeling between the two. Eradicate  had served in the Swift family many years, and he rather resented  the coming of the giant, who performed many services formerly the  province of the colored man.    \"Well, never mind what he is, Rad,\" laughed Tom. \"You just show me  what you did. Come now, something happened in here, and I want to  find out what it was.\"    \"Oh, suffin done happened all right, Massa Tom. Yas, sah! Suffin  done happened!\" cried Eradicate, with such odd emphasis that Tom  and Ned both laughed.    \"An' suffin happened to me,\" went on the colored man, rubbing his  shocked arm.    \"Well, tell us about it,\" suggested Tom.    \"It was dish yeah way,\" proceeded Eradicate. And he told more in  detail how, seeing Koku cleaning and sweeping out the other  telephone booth, he had thought of the trick to play on him. Both  telephones had what are called \"amplifiers\" attached, that could  be switched on when needed. These amplifiers were somewhat like  the horn of a phonograph--they increased, or magnified the sound,  so that one could hear a voice from any part of the shop, and need  not necessarily have the telephone receiver at his ear.    Seeing Koku near the instrument, Eradicate had switched on the  amplifier, and had called into his instrument, trying to scare the  giant. And he did startle Koku, for the loud voice, coming so  suddenly, sent the giant out of the booth on the run.    \"But you must have done something else,\" insisted Tom. \"Look here,  Rad,\" and the young inventor pointed to the picture on the plate.    \"Mah gracious sakes!\" gasped the colored man. \"Why dat's Koku  hisse'f!\" and he looked in awe at the likeness.    \"That's what you did, Rad!\"    \"Me? I done dat? No, sah, Massa Tom. I neber did! No, sah!\"  Eradicate spoke emphatically.    \"Yes you did, Rad. You took that picture of Koku over my photo  telephone, and I want you to show me exactly what you did--what  wires and switches you touched and changed, and all that.\"    \"Yo--yo' done say I tuck dat pishure, Massa Tom?\"    \"You sure did, Rad.\"    \"Well--well, good land o' massy! An' I done dat!\"    Eradicate stared in wonder at the image of the giant on the plate,  and shook his head doubtingly.    \"I--I didn't know I could do it. I never knowed I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#13)"],[1,"have perceived by thy letters) two things: the first is my  conceit of thee, and thy stirring; and the other is my counsel in  this case, and in all such others when they come.    As to the first, I answer and I say that I dread full much in this  matter and such others to put forth my rude conceit, such as it is,  for two skills.[235] And one is this: I dare not lean to my conceit,  affirming it for fast and true. The other is thine inward  disposition, and thine ableness that thou hast unto all these things  that thou speakest of in thy letter, which be not yet so fully known  unto me, as it were speedful that they were, if I should give full  counsel in this case. For it is said of the Apostle: Nemo novit quae  sunt hominis, nisi spiritus hominis qui in ipso est; \"No man knoweth  which are the privy dispositions of man, but the spirit of the same  man, the which is in himself\";[236] and, peradventure, thou knowest  not yet thine own inward disposition thyself, so fully as thou shalt  do hereafter, when God will let thee feel it by the proof, among  many failings and risings. For I knew never yet no sinner that might  come to the perfect knowing of himself and of his inward  disposition, but if he were learned of it before in the school of  God, by experience of many temptations, and by many failings and  risings; for right as among the waves and the floods and the storms  of the sea, on the one party, and the peaceable wind and the calms  and the soft weathers of the air on the other party, the sely[237]  ship at the last attains to the land and the haven; right so, among  the diversity of temptations and tribulations that falleth to a soul  in this ebbing and flowing life (the which are ensampled by the  storms and the floods of the sea) on the one party, and among the  grace and the goodness of the Holy Ghost, the manyfold visitation,  sweetness and comfort of spirit (the which are ensampled by the  peaceable wind and the soft weathers of the air) on the other party,  the sely soul, at the likeness of a ship, attaineth at the last to  the land of stableness, and to the haven of health; the which is the  clear and the soothfast knowing of himself, and of all his inward  dispositions, through the which knowing he sitteth quietly in  himself, as a king crowned in his royalme, mightily, wisely, and  goodly governing himself and all his thoughts and stirrings, both in  body and in soul. Of such a man it is that the wise man saith thus:  Beatus vir qui suffert tentationem, quoniam cum probatus fuerit,  accipiet coronam vitae, quam repromisit Deus diligentibus se: \"He is  a blissful man that sufferingly beareth temptation; for, from he  have been proved, he shall take the crown of life, the which God  hath hight to all those that love Him.\"[238] The crown of life may  be said on two manners. One for ghostly wisdom, for full discretion,  and for perfection of virtue: these three knitted together may be  cleped[239] a crown of life, the which by grace may be come to here  in this life. On another manner the crown of life may be said, that  it is the endless joy that each true soul shall have, after this  life, in the bliss of heaven, and, sikerly, neither of these two  crowns may a man take, but if he before have been well proved in  suffering of noye[240] and of temptation, as this text saith:  Quoniam cum probatus fuerit, accipiet coronam vitae; that is: \"From  that he have been proved, then shall he take the crown of  life\";[241] as who saith (according to mine understanding touched  before): But if a sinner have been proved before in divers  temptations, now rising, now falling, falling by frailty, rising by  grace, he shall never else take of God in this life ghostly wisdom  in clear knowing of himself and of his inward dispositions, nor full  discretion in counselling and teaching of others, nor yet the third,  the which is the perfection of virtue in loving of his God and of  his brethren. All these three--wisdom, discretion, and perfection of  virtue-are but one, and they may be cleped the crown of life.    In a crown are three things: gold is the first; precious stones are  the second; and the turrets of the flower-de-luce, raised up above  the head, those are the third. By gold, wisdom; by the precious  stones, discretion; and by the turrets of the flower-de-luce I  understand the perfection of virtue. Gold environeth the head, and  by wisdom we govern our ghostly work on every side; precious stones  giveth light in beholding of men, and by discretion we teach and  counsel our brethren; the turrets of the flower-de-luce giveth two  side branches spreading one to the right side and another to the  left, and one even up above the head, and by perfection of virtues  (the which is charity) we give two side branches of love, the which  are spreading, one to the right side to our friends, and one to the  left side to our enemies, and one even up unto God, above man's  understanding, the which is the head of the soul. This is the crown  of life the which by grace may be gotten here in this life; and,  therefore, bear thee low in thy battle, and suffer meekly thy  temptations till thou have been proved. For then shalt thou take  either the one crown, or the other, or both, this here, and the  other there; for who so hath this here, he may be full siker of the  other there; and full many there are that are full graciously proved  here, and yet come never to this that may be had here in this life.  The which (if they meekly continue and patiently abide the will of  our Lord) shall full worthily and abundantly receive the other  there, in the high bliss of heaven. Thee thinketh this crown fair  that may be had here; yea, bear thee as meekly as thou mayst by  grace, for in comparison of the other there, it is but as one noble  to a world full of gold. All this I say to give thee comfort and  evidence of strength in thy ghostly battle, the which thou hast  taken on hand in the trust of our Lord, and all this I say to let  thee see how far thou art yet from the true knowing of thine inward  disposition, and thereafter to give thee warning, not over soon to  give stead[242] nor to follow the singular stirrings of thy young  heart, for dread of deceit.    All this I say for to show unto thee my conceit that I have of thee  and of thy stirrings, as thou hast asked of me; for I conceive of  thee that thou art full able and full greatly disposed to such  sudden stirrings of singular doings,[243] and full fast to cleave  unto them when they be received; and that is full perilous. I say  not that this ableness and this greedy disposition in thee, or in  any other that is disposed as thou art, though all it be perilous,  that it is therefore evil in itself; nay, so say I not, God forbid  that thou take it so; but I say that it is full good in itself, and  a full great ableness to full great perfection, yea, and to the  greatest perfection that may be in this life; I mean, if that a soul  that is so disposed will busily, night and day, meek it[244] to God  and to good counsel, and strongly rise and martyr itself, with  casting down of the own wit and the own will in all such sudden and  singular stirrings, and say sharply that it will not follow such  stirrings, seem they never so liking,[245] so high nor so holy, but  if it have thereto the witness[246] and the consents of some ghostly  teachers--I mean such as have been of long time expert in singular  living. Such a soul, for ghostly continuance thus in this meekness,  may deserve, through grace and the experience of this ghostly battle  thus with itself, for to take the crown of life touched before. And  as great an ableness to good as is this manner of disposition in a  soul that is thus meeked as I say, as perilous it is in another  soul, such one that will suddenly, without advisement of counsel,  follow the stirrings of the greedy heart, by the own wit and the own  will; and therefore, for God's love, beware with this ableness and  with this manner of disposition (that I speak of), if it be in thee  as I say. And meek thee continually to prayer and to counsel. Break  down thine own wit and thy will in all such sudden and singular  stirrings, and follow them not over lightly, till thou wete whence  they come, and whether they be according for thee or not.    And as touching these stirrings of the which thou askest my conceit  and my counsel, I say to thee that I conceive of them suspiciously,  that is, that[247] they should be conceived on the ape's manner. Men  say commonly that the ape doth as he seeth others do; forgive me if  I err in my suspicion, I pray thee. Nevertheless, the love that I  have to thy soul stirreth me by evidence that I have of a ghostly  brother of thine and of mine, touched with those same stirrings of  full great[248] silence, of full singular fasting, and of full only  woning, on ape's manner, as he granted unto me after long communing  with me, and when he had proved himself and his stirrings. For, as  he said, he had seen a man in your country, the which man, as it is  well known, is evermore in great silence, in singular fasting, and  in only dwelling; and certes, as I suppose fully, they are full true  stirrings those that that man hath, caused all only of grace, that  he feeleth by experience within, and not of any sight or heard say  that he hath of any other man's silence without-the which cause if  it were, it should be cleped apely, as I say in my simple meaning.  And therefore beware, and prove well thy stirrings, and whence they  come; for how so thou art stirred, whether from within by grace, or  from without on ape's manner, God wote, and I not. Nevertheless this  may I say thee in eschewing of perils like unto this: look that thou  be no ape, that is to say, look that thy stirrings to silence or to  speaking, to fasting or to eating, to onliness or to company,  whether they be come from within of abundance of love and of"]]]
