[64] There are other manitous without local habitation, some good, some  evil, countless in number and indefinite in attributes. They fill the  world, and control the destinies of men,--that is to say, of Indians:  for the primitive Indian holds that the white man lives under a  spiritual rule distinct from that which governs his own fate. These  beings, also, appear for the most part in the shape of animals.  Sometimes, however, they assume human proportions; but more frequently  they take the form of stones, which, being broken, are found full of  living blood and flesh.    [63] Many tribes have tales of diminutive beings, which, in the absence  of a better word, may be called fairies. In the Travels of Lewis and  Clarke, there is mention of a hill on the Missouri, supposed to be  haunted by them. These Western fairies correspond to the Puck Wudj  Ininee of Ojibwa tradition. As an example of the monsters alluded to,  see the Saginaw story of the Weendigoes, in Schoolcraft, Algic  Researches, II. 105.  [64] The figure of a large bird is perhaps the most common,--as, for  example, the good spirit of Rock Island: \"He was white, with wings like  a swan, but ten times larger.\"--Autobiography of Blackhawk, 70.    Each primitive Indian has his guardian manitou, to whom he looks for  counsel, guidance, and protection. These spiritual allies are gained by  the following process. At the age of fourteen or fifteen, the Indian boy  blackens his face, retires to some solitary place, and remains for days  without food. Superstitious expectancy and the exhaustion of abstinence  rarely fail of their results. His sleep is haunted by visions, and the  form which first or most often appears is that of his guardian  manitou,--a beast, a bird, a fish, a serpent, or some other object,  animate or inanimate. An eagle or a bear is the vision of a destined  warrior; a wolf, of a successful hunter; while a serpent foreshadows the  future medicine-man, or, according to others, portends disaster. [65]  The young Indian thenceforth wears about his person the object revealed  in his dream, or some portion of it,--as a bone, a feather, a  snake-skin, or a tuft of hair. This, in the modern language of the  forest and prairie, is known as his \"medicine.\" The Indian yields to it  a sort of worship, propitiates it with offerings of tobacco, thanks it  in prosperity, and upbraids it in disaster. [66] If his medicine fails  to bring the desired success, he will sometimes discard it and adopt  another. The superstition now becomes mere fetich-worship, since the  Indian regards the mysterious object which he carries about him rather  as an embodiment than as a representative of a supernatural power.    [65] Compare Cass, in North-American Review, Second Series, XIII. 100. A  turkey-buzzard, according to him, is the vision of a medicine-man. I  once knew an old Dahcotah chief, who was greatly respected, but had  never been to war, though belonging to a family of peculiarly warlike  propensities. The reason was, that, in his initiatory fast, he had  dreamed of an antelope,--the peace-spirit of his people.    Women fast, as well as men,--always at the time of transition from  childhood to maturity. In the Narrative of John Tanner, there is an  account of an old woman who had fasted, in her youth, for ten days, and  throughout her life placed the firmest faith in the visions which had  appeared to her at that time. Among the Northern Algonquins, the  practice, down to a recent day, was almost universal.  [66] The author has seen a Dahcotah warrior open his medicine-bag, talk  with an air of affectionate respect to the bone, feather, or horn  within, and blow tobacco-smoke upon it as an offering. \"Medicines\" are  acquired not only by fasting, but by casual dreams, and otherwise. They  are sometimes even bought and sold. For a curious account of  medicine-bags and fetich-worship among the Algonquins of GaspÃ©, see Le  Clerc, Nouvelle Relation de la GaspÃ©sie, Chap. XIII.    Indian belief recognizes also another and very different class of  beings. Besides the giants and monsters of legendary lore, other  conceptions may be discerned, more or less distinct, and of a character  partly mythical. Of these the most conspicuous is that remarkable  personage of Algonquin tradition, called Manabozho, Messou, Michabou,  Nanabush, or the Great Hare. As each species of animal has its archetype  or king, so, among the Algonquins, Manabozho is king of all these animal  kings. Tradition is diverse as to his origin. According to the most  current belief, his father was the West-Wind, and his mother a  great-granddaughter of the Moon. His character is worthy of such a  parentage. Sometimes he is a wolf, a bird, or a gigantic hare,  surrounded by a court of quadrupeds; sometimes he appears in human  shape, majestic in stature and wondrous in endowment, a mighty magician,  a destroyer of serpents and evil manitous; sometimes he is a vain and  treacherous imp, full of childish whims and petty trickery, the butt and  victim of men, beasts, and spirits. His powers of transformation are  without limit; his curiosity and malice are insatiable; and of the  numberless legends of which he is the hero, the greater part are as  trivial as they are incoherent. [67] It does not appear that Manabozho  was ever an object of worship; yet, despite his absurdity, tradition  declares him to be chief among the manitous, in short, the \"Great  Spirit.\" [68] It was he who restored the world, submerged by a deluge.  He was hunting in company with a certain wolf, who was his brother, or,  by other accounts, his grandson, when his quadruped relative fell  through the ice of a frozen lake, and was at once devoured by certain  serpents lurking in the depths of the waters. Manabozho, intent on  revenge, transformed himself into the stump of a tree, and by this  artifice surprised and slew the king of the serpents, as he basked with  his followers in the noontide sun. The serpents, who were all manitous,  caused, in their rage, the waters of the lake to deluge the earth.  Manabozho climbed a tree, which, in answer to his entreaties, grew as  the flood rose around it, and thus saved him from the vengeance of the  evil spirits. Submerged to the neck, he looked abroad on the waste of  waters, and at length descried the bird known as the loon, to whom he  appealed for aid in the task of restoring the world. The loon dived in  search of a little mud, as material for reconstruction, but could not  reach the bottom. A musk-rat made the same attempt, but soon reappeared  floating on his back, and apparently dead. Manabozho, however, on  searching his paws, discovered in one of them a particle of the desired  mud, and of this, together with the body of the loon, created the world  anew. [69]    [67] Mr. Schoolcraft has collected many of these tales. See his Algic  Researches, Vol. I. Compare the stories of Messou, given by Le Jeune  (Relations, 1633, 1634), and the account of Nanabush, by Edwin James, in  his notes to Tanner's Narrative of Captivity and Adventures during a  Thirty-Years' Residence among the Indians; also the account of the Great  Hare, in the MÃ©moire of Nicolas Perrot, Chaps. I., II.  [68] \"Presque toutes les Nations Algonquines ont donnÃ© le nom de Grand  LiÃ¨vre au Premier Esprit, quelques-uns l'appellent Michabou  (Manabozho).\"--Charlevoix, Journal Historique, 344.  [69] This is a form of the story still current among the remoter  Algonquins. Compare the story of Messou, in Le Jeune, Relation, 1633,  16. It is substantially the same.    There are various forms of this tradition, in some of which Manabozho  appears, not as the restorer, but as the creator of the world, forming  mankind from the carcasses of beasts, birds, and fishes. [70] Other  stories represent him as marrying a female musk-rat, by whom he became  the progenitor of the human race. [71]    [70] In the beginning of all things, Manabozho, in the form of the Great  Hare, was on a raft, surrounded by animals who acknowledged him as their  chief. No land could be seen. Anxious to create the world, the Great  Hare persuaded the beaver to dive for mud; but the adventurous diver  floated to the surface senseless. The otter next tried, and failed like  his predecessor. The musk-rat now offered himself for the desperate  task. He plunged, and, after remaining a day and night beneath the  surface, reappeared, floating on his back beside the raft, apparently  dead, and with all his paws fast closed. On opening them, the other  animals found in one of them a grain of sand, and of this the Great Hare  created the world.--Perrot, MÃ©moire, Chap. I.  [71] Le Jeune, Relation, 1633, 16.--The musk-rat is always a conspicuous  figure in Algonquin cosmogony.    It is said that Messou, or Manabozho, once gave to an Indian the gift of  immortality, tied in a bundle, enjoining him never to open it. The  Indian's wife, however, impelled by curiosity, one day cut the string,  the precious gift flew out, and Indians have ever since been subject to  death. Le Jeune, Relation, 1634, 13.    Searching for some higher conception of supernatural existence, we find,  among a portion of the primitive Algonquins, traces of a vague belief in  a spirit dimly shadowed forth under the name of Atahocan, to whom it  does not appear that any attributes were ascribed or any worship  offered, and of whom the Indians professed to know nothing whatever;  [72] but there is no evidence that this belief extended beyond certain  tribes of the Lower St. Lawrence. Others saw a supreme manitou in the  Sun. [73] The Algonquins believed also in a malignant manitou, in whom  the early missionaries failed not to recognize the Devil, but who was  far less dreaded than his wife. She wore a robe made of the hair of her  victims, for she was the cause of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6934"],[0,"The Radio Amateur's Hand Book (#13)"],[1,"otential, currents which are developed by the secondary  coil, reach the balls, or _electrodes_, of the spark gap the latter  are alternately charged positively and negatively.    Now take a given instant when one electrode is charged positively and  the other one is charged negatively, then when they are charged to a  high enough potential the electric strain breaks down the air gap  between them and the two charges rush together as described in the  chapter before this one in connection with the discharge of a  condenser. When the charges rush together they form a current which  burns out the air in the gap and this gives rise to the spark, and as  the heated gap between the two electrodes is a very good conductor the  electric current surges forth and back with high frequency, perhaps a  dozen times, before the air replaces that which has burned out. It is  the inrushing air to fill the vacuum of the gap that makes the  crackling noise which accompanies the discharge of the electric spark.    In this way then electric oscillations of the order of a million, more  or less, are produced and if an aerial and a ground wire are connected  to the spark balls, or electrodes, the oscillations will surge up and  down it and the energy of these in turn, are changed into electric  waves which travel out into space. An open circuit transmitter of this  kind will send out waves that are four times as long as the aerial  itself, but as the waves it sends out are strongly damped the  Government will not permit it to be used.    The Closed Oscillation Circuit.--By using a closed oscillation circuit  the transmitter can be tuned to send out waves of a given length and  while the waves are not so strongly damped more current can be sent  into the aerial wire system. The closed oscillation circuit consists  of: (1) a _spark gap_, (2) a _condenser_ and (3) an _oscillation  transformer_. The high potential alternating current delivered by the  secondary coil not only charges the spark gap electrodes which  necessarily have a very small capacitance, but it charges the  condenser which has a large capacitance and the value of which can be  changed at will.    Now when the condenser is fully charged it discharges through the  spark gap and then the electric oscillations set up surge to and fro  through the closed circuit. As a closed circuit is a very poor  radiator of energy, that is, the electric oscillations are not freely  converted into electric waves by it, they surge up to, and through the  aerial wire; now as the aerial wire is a good radiator nearly all of  the energy of the electric oscillations which surge through it are  converted into electric waves.    How Transmitting Set No. 2 Works. With Alternating Current. The  operation of a transmitting set that uses an alternating current  transformer, or _power transformer,_ as it is sometimes called, is  even more simple than one using a spark coil. The transformer needs no  vibrator when used with alternating current. The current from a  generator flows through the primary coil of the transformer and the  alternations of the usual lighting current is 60 cycles per second.  This current sets up an alternating magnetic field in the core of the  transformer and as these magnetic lines of force expand and contract  they set up alternating currents of the same frequency but of much  higher voltage at the terminals of the secondary coil according to the  ratio of the primary and secondary turns of wire as explained under  the sub-caption of _Ratio of Transformation_.    With Direct Current.--When a 110 volt direct current is used to  energize the power transformer an _electrolytic_ interruptor is needed  to make and break the primary circuit, just as a vibrator is needed  for the same purpose with a spark coil. When the electrodes are  connected in series with the primary coil of a transformer and a  source of direct current having a potential of 40 to 110 volts,  bubbles of gas are formed on the end of the platinum, or alloy anode,  which prevent the current from flowing until the bubbles break and  then the current flows again, in this way the current is rapidly made  and broken and the break is very sharp.    Where this type of interrupter is employed the condenser that is  usually shunted around the break is not necessary as the interrupter  itself has a certain inherent capacitance, due to electrolytic action,  and which is called its _electrolytic capacitance_, and this is large  enough to balance the self-induction of the circuit since the greater  the number of breaks per minute the smaller the capacitance required.    The Rotary Spark Gap.--In this type of spark gap the two fixed  electrodes are connected with the terminals of the secondary coil of  the power transformer and also with the condenser and primary of the  oscillation transformer. Now whenever any pair of electrodes on the  rotating disk are in a line with the pair of fixed electrodes a spark  will take place, hence the pitch of the note depends on the speed of  the motor driving the disk. This kind of a rotary spark-gap is called  _non-synchronous_ and it is generally used where a 60 cycle  alternating current is available but it will work with other higher  frequencies.    The Quenched Spark Gap.--If you strike a piano string a single quick  blow it will continue to vibrate according to its natural period. This  is very much the way in which a quenched spark gap sets up  oscillations in a coupled closed and open circuit. The oscillations  set up in the primary circuit by a quenched spark make only three or  four sharp swings and in so doing transfer all of their energy over to  the secondary circuit, where it will oscillate some fifty times or  more before it is damped out, because the high frequency currents are  not forced, but simply oscillate to the natural frequency of the  circuit. For this reason the radiated waves approach somewhat the  condition of continuous waves, and so sharper tuning is possible.    The Oscillation Transformer.--In this set the condenser in the closed  circuit is charged and discharged and sets up oscillations that surge  through the closed circuit as in _Set No. 1_. In this set, however, an  oscillation transformer is used and as the primary coil of it is  included in the closed circuit the oscillations set up in it produce  strong oscillating magnetic lines of force. The magnetic field thus  produced sets up in turn electric oscillations in the secondary coil  of the oscillation transformer and these surge through the aerial wire  system where their energy is radiated in the form of electric waves.    The great advantage of using an oscillation transformer instead of a  simple inductance coil is that the capacitance of the closed circuit  can be very much larger than that of the aerial wire system. This  permits more energy to be stored up by the condenser and this is  impressed on the aerial when it is radiated as electric waves.    How Receiving Set No. I Works.--When the electric waves from a distant  sending station impinge on the wire of a receiving aerial their energy  is changed into electric oscillations that are of exactly the same  frequency (assuming the receptor is tuned to the transmitter) but  whose current strength (amperage) and potential (voltage) are very  small. These electric waves surge through the closed circuit but when  they reach the crystal detector the contact of the metal point on the  crystal permits more current to flow through it in one direction than  it will allow to pass in the other direction. For this reason a  crystal detector is sometimes called a _rectifier_, which it really  is.    Thus the high frequency currents which the steel magnet cores of the  telephone receiver would choke off are changed by the detector into  intermittent direct currents which can flow through the magnet coils  of the telephone receiver. Since the telephone receiver chokes off the  oscillations, a small condenser can be shunted around it so that a  complete closed oscillation circuit is formed and this gives better  results.    When the intermittent rectified current flows through the coils of the  telephone receiver it energizes the magnet as long as it lasts, when  it is de-energized; this causes the soft iron disk, or _diaphragm_ as  it is called, which sets close to the ends of the poles of the magnet,  to vibrate; and this in turn gives forth sounds such as dots and  dashes, speech or music, according to the nature of the electric waves  that sent them out at the distant station.    How Receiving Set No. 2 Works.--When the electric oscillations that  are set up by the incoming electric waves on the aerial wire surge  through the primary coil of the oscillation transformer they produce a  magnetic field and as the lines of force of the latter cut the  secondary coil, oscillations of the same frequency are set up in it.  The potential (voltage) of these oscillations are, however, _stepped  down_ in the secondary coil and, hence, their current strength  (amperes) is increased.    The oscillations then flow through the closed circuit where they are  rectified by the crystal detector and transformed into sound waves by  the telephone receiver as described in connection with _Set No. 1_.  The variable condenser shunted across the closed circuit permits finer  secondary tuning to be done than is possible without it. Where you  are receiving continuous waves from a wireless telephone transmitter  (speech or music) you have to tune sharper than is possible with the  tuning coil alone and to do this a variable condenser connected in  parallel with the secondary coil is necessary.          CHAPTER VII    MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL TUNING      There is a strikingly close resemblance between _sound waves_ and the  way they are set up in _the air_ by a mechanically vibrating body,  such as a steel spring or a tuning fork, and _electric waves_ and the  way they are set "]]]
