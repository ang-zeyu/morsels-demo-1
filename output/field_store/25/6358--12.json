Suddenly the First and Foremost swung his brass hoop and caught Guph  around the neck with it.  The next instant, before the General could  think what had happened to him, he was dragged inside the rock hut.  Here, his eyes still blinded to realities, he perceived only a dim  light, by which the hut seemed as rough and rude inside as it was  outside.  Yet he had a strange feeling that many bright eyes were  fastened upon him and that he stood in a vast and extensive hall.    The First and Foremost now laughed grimly and released his prisoner.    \"If you have anything to say that is interesting,\" he remarked, \"speak  out, before I strangle you.\"    So Guph spoke out.  He tried not to pay any attention to a strange  rustling sound that he heard, as of an unseen multitude drawing near to  listen to his words.  His eyes could see only the fierce bear-man, and  to him he addressed his speech.  First he told of his plan to conquer  the Land of Oz and plunder the country of its riches and enslave its  people, who, being fairies, could not be killed.  After relating all  this, and telling of the tunnel the Nome King was building, he said he  had come to ask the First and Foremost to join the Nomes, with his band  of terrible warriors, and help them to defeat the Oz people.    The General spoke very earnestly and impressively, but when he had  finished the bear-man began to laugh as if much amused, and his  laughter seemed to be echoed by a chorus of merriment from an unseen  multitude.  Then, for the first time, Guph began to feel a trifle  worried.    \"Who else has promised to help you?\" finally asked the First and  Foremost.    \"The Whimsies,\" replied the General.    Again the bear-headed Phanfasm laughed.    \"Any others?\" he inquired.    \"Only the Growleywogs,\" said Guph.    This answer set the First and Foremost laughing anew.    \"What share of the spoils am I to have?\" was the next question.    \"Anything you like, except King Roquat's Magic Belt,\" replied Guph.    At this the Phanfasm set up a roar of laughter, which had its echo in  the unseen chorus, and the bear-man seemed so amused that he actually  rolled upon the ground and shouted with merriment.    \"Oh, these blind and foolish Nomes!\" he said.  \"How big they seem to  themselves and how small they really are!\"    Suddenly he arose and seized Guph's neck with one hairy paw, dragging  him out of the hut into the open.    Here he gave a curious wailing cry, and, as if in answer, from all the  rocky huts on the mountain-top came flocking a horde of Phanfasms, all  with hairy bodies, but wearing heads of various animals, birds and  reptiles.  All were ferocious and repulsive-looking to the deceived  eyes of the Nome, and Guph could not repress a shudder of disgust as he  looked upon them.    The First and Foremost slowly raised his arms, and in a twinkling his  hairy skin fell from him and he appeared before the astonished Nome as  a beautiful woman, clothed in a flowing gown of pink gauze.  In her  dark hair flowers were entwined, and her face was noble and calm.    At the same instant the entire band of Phanfasms was transformed into a  pack of howling wolves, running here and there as they snarled and  showed their ugly yellow fangs.    The woman now raised her arms, even as the man-bear had done, and in a  twinkling the wolves became crawling lizards, while she herself changed  into a huge butterfly.    Guph had only time to cry out in fear and take a step backward to avoid  the lizards when another transformation occurred, and all returned  instantly to the forms they had originally worn.    Then the First and Foremost, who had resumed his hairy body and bear  head, turned to the Nome and asked:    \"Do you still demand our assistance?\"    \"More than ever,\" answered the General, firmly.    \"Then tell me: what can you offer the Phanfasms that they have not  already?\" inquired the First and Foremost.    Guph hesitated.  He really did not know what to say.  The Nome King's  vaunted Magic Belt seemed a poor thing compared to the astonishing  magical powers of these people.  Gold, jewels and slaves they might  secure in any quantity without especial effort.  He felt that he was  dealing with powers greatly beyond him.  There was but one argument  that might influence the Phanfasms, who were creatures of evil.    \"Permit me to call your attention to the exquisite joy of making the  happy unhappy,\" said he at last.  \"Consider the pleasure of destroying  innocent and harmless people.\"    \"Ah! you have answered me,\" cried the First and Foremost.  \"For that  reason alone we will aid you.  Go home, and tell your bandy-legged king  that as soon as his tunnel is finished the Phanfasms will be with him  and lead his legions to the conquest of Oz.  The deadly desert alone  has kept us from destroying Oz long ago, and your underground tunnel is  a clever thought.  Go home, and prepare for our coming!\"    Guph was very glad to be permitted to go with this promise.  The  owl-man led him back down the mountain path and ordered the scarlet  alligator to crawl away and allow the Nome to cross the bridge in  safety.    After the visitor had gone a brilliant and gorgeous city appeared upon  the mountain top, clearly visible to the eyes of the gaily dressed  multitude of Phanfasms that lived there.  And the First and Foremost,  beautifully arrayed, addressed the others in these words:    \"It is time we went into the world and brought sorrow and dismay to its  people.  Too long have we remained for ourselves upon this mountain  top, for while we are thus secluded many nations have grown happy and  prosperous, and the chief joy of the race of Phanfasms is to destroy  happiness.  So I think it is lucky that this messenger from the Nomes  arrived among us just now, to remind us that the opportunity has come  for us to make trouble.  We will use King Roquat's tunnel to conquer  the Land of Oz.  Then we will destroy the Whimsies, the Growleywogs and  the Nomes, and afterward go out to ravage and annoy and grieve the  whole world.\"    The multitude of evil Phanfasms eagerly applauded this plan, which they  fully approved.    I am told that the Erbs are the most powerful and merciless of all the  evil spirits, and the Phanfasms of Phantastico belong to the race of  Erbs.        12.  How they Matched the Fuddles    Dorothy and her fellow travelers rode away from the Cuttenclip village  and followed the indistinct path as far as the sign-post.  Here they  took the main road again and proceeded pleasantly through the pretty  farming country.  When evening came they stopped at a dwelling and were  joyfully welcomed and given plenty to eat and good beds for the night.    Early next morning, however, they were up and eager to start, and after  a good breakfast they bade their host good-bye and climbed into the red  wagon, to which the Sawhorse had been hitched all night.  Being made of  wood, this horse never got tired nor cared to lie down.  Dorothy was  not quite sure whether he ever slept or not, but it was certain that he  never did when anybody was around.    The weather is always beautiful in Oz, and this morning the air was  cool and refreshing and the sunshine brilliant and delightful.    In about an hour they came to a place where another road branched off.  There was a sign-post here which read:      THIS WAY TO FUDDLECUMJIG      \"Oh, here is where we turn,\" said Dorothy, observing the sign.    \"What!  Are we going to Fuddlecumjig?\" asked the Captain General.    \"Yes; Ozma thought we might enjoy the Fuddles.  They are said to be  very interesting,\" she replied.    \"No one would suspect it from their name,\" said Aunt Em.  \"Who are  they, anyhow?  More paper things?\"    \"I think not,\" answered Dorothy, laughing; \"but I can't say 'zactly,  Aunt Em, what they are.  We'll find out when we get there.\"    \"Perhaps the Wizard knows,\" suggested Uncle Henry.    \"No; I've never been there before,\" said the Wizard.  \"But I've often  heard of Fuddlecumjig and the Fuddles, who are said to be the most  peculiar people in all the Land of Oz.\"    \"In what way?\" asked the Shaggy Man.    \"I don't know, I'm sure,\" said the Wizard.    Just then, as they rode along the pretty green lane toward  Fuddlecumjig, they espied a kangaroo sitting by the roadside.  The poor  animal had its face covered with both its front paws and was crying so  bitterly that the tears coursed down its cheeks in two tiny streams and  trickled across the road, where they formed a pool in a small hollow.    The Sawhorse stopped short at this pitiful sight, and Dorothy cried  out, with ready sympathy:    \"What's the matter, Kangaroo?\"    \"Boo-hoo!  Boo-hoo!\" wailed the Kangaroo; \"I've lost my mi--mi--mi--Oh,  boo-hoo!  Boo-hoo!\"--    \"Poor thing,\" said the Wizard, \"she's lost her mister.  It's probably  her husband, and he's dead.\"    \"No, no, no!\" sobbed the kangaroo.  \"It--it isn't that.  I've lost my  mi--mi--Oh, boo, boo-hoo!\"    \"I know,\" said the Shaggy Man; \"she's lost her mirror.\"    \"No; it's my mi--mi--mi--Boo-hoo!  My mi--Oh, Boo-hoo!\" and the  kangaroo cried harder than ever.    \"It must be her mince-pie,\" suggested Aunt Em.    \"Or her milk-toast,\" proposed Uncle Henry.    \"I've lost my mi--mi--mittens!\" said the kangaroo, getting it out at  last.    \"Oh!\" cried the Yellow Hen, with a cackle of relief.  \"Why didn't you  say so before?\"    \"Boo-hoo!  I--I--couldn't,\" answered the kangaroo.    \"But, see here,\" said Dorothy, \"you don't need mittens in this warm  weather.\"    \"Yes, indeed I do,\" replied the animal, stopping her sobs and removing  her paws from her face to look at the little girl reproachfully.  \"My  hands will get all sunburned and tanned without my mittens, and I've  worn them so long that I'll probably catch cold without them.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said Dorothy.  \"I never heard of any kangaroo wearing  mittens.\"    \"Didn'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#13)"],[1,"gers, and talked so much of  his own dexterity in the art that Boku-den, provoked by his brag,  broke silence.  'You seem, my friend, to practise the art in order to  conquer the enemy, but I do it in order not to be conquered,' said  Boku-den.  'O monk,' demanded the man, as Boku-den was clad like a  Zen monk, 'what school of swordsmanship do you belong to?'  Well,  mine is the Conquering-enemy-without-fighting-school.'  'Don't tell a  fib, old monk.  If you could conquer the enemy without fighting, what  then is your sword for?'  'My sword is not to kill, but to save,'  said Boku-den, making use of Zen phrases; 'my art is transmitted from  mind to mind.'  'Now then, come, monk,' challenged the man, 'let us  see, right at this moment, who is the victor, you or I.'  The  gauntlet was picked up without hesitation.  'But we must not fight,'  said Boku-den, 'in the ferry, lest the passengers should be hurt.  Yonder a small island you see.  There we shall decide the contest.'  To this proposal the man agreed, and the boat was pulled to that  island.  No sooner had the boat reached the shore than the man jumped  over to the land, and cried: 'Come on, monk, quick, quick!'  Boku-den, however, slowly rising, said: 'Do not hasten to lose your  head.  It is a rule of my school to prepare slowly for fighting,  keeping the soul in the abdomen.'  So saying he snatched the oar from  the boatman and rowed the boat back to some distance, leaving the man  alone, who, stamping the ground madly, cried out: 'O, you fly, monk,  you coward.  Come, old monk!'  'Now listen,' said Boku-den, 'this is  the secret art of the Conquering-enemy-without-fighting-school.  Beware that you do not forget it, nor tell it to anybody else.'  Thus, getting rid of the brawling fellow, Boku-den and his  fellow-passengers safely landed on the opposite shore.\"[FN#101]  The  O Baku School of Zen was introduced by Yin Yuen (In-gen) who crossed  the sea in 1654, accompanied by many able disciples.[FN#102]  The  Shogunate gave him a tract of land at Uji, near Kyo-to, and in 1659  he built there a monastery noted for its Chinese style of  architecture, now known as O-baku-san.  The teachers of the same  school[FN#103] came one after another from China, and Zen[FN#104]  peculiar to them, flourished a short while.      [FN#101]  Shi-seki-shu-ran.    [FN#102]  In-gen (1654-1673) came over with Ta-Mei (Dai-bi, died  1673), Hwui Lin (E-rin died 1681), Tuh Chan (Doku-tan, died 1706),  and others.  For the life of In-gen: see Zoku-ko-shu-den and  Kaku-shu-ko-yo.    [FN#103]  Tsih Fei (Soku-hi died 1671), Muh Ngan (Moku-an died 1684),  Kao Tsuen (Ko-sen died 1695), the author of Fu-so-zen-rin-so-bo-den,  To-koku-ko-so-den, and Sen-un-shu, are best known.    [FN#104]  This is a sub-sect of the Rin Zai School, as shown in the  following table:    TABLE OF THE TRANSMISSION OF ZEN FROM CHINA TO JAPAN.    1. Bodhidharma.  2. Hwui Ko (E-ka).  3.

The O Baku School is the amalgamation of Zen and the worship of  Amitabha, and different from the other two schools.  The statistics  for 1911 give the following figures:    The Number of Temples:    The So To School   14,255  The Rin Zai School   6,128  The O Baku School   546    The Number of Teachers:    The So To School   9,576  The Rin Zai School   4,523  The O Baku School   349      It was also in this period that Zen gained a great influence on the  popular literature characterized by the shortest form of poetical  composition.  This was done through the genius of Ba-sho,[FN#105] a  great literary man, recluse and traveller, who, as his writings show  us, made no small progress in the study of Zen.  Again, it was made  use of by the teachers of popular[FN#106] ethics, who did a great  deal in the education of the lower classes.  In this way Zen and its  peculiar taste gradually found its way into the arts of peace, such  as literature, fine art, tea-ceremony, cookery, gardening,  architecture, and at last it has permeated through every fibre of  Japanese life.    [FN#105]  He (died 1694) learned Zen under a contemporary Zen master  (Buccho), and is said to have been enlightened before his reformation  of the popular literature.    [FN#106]  The teaching was called Shin-gaku, or the 'learning of  mind.'  It was first taught by Bai-gan (Ishi-da), and is the  reconciliation of Shintoism and Buddhism with Confucianism.  Bai-gan  and his successors practised Meditation, and were enlightened in  their own way.  Do-ni (Naka-zawa, died 1803) made use of Zen more  than any other teacher.        13. Zen after the Restoration.    After the Restoration of the Mei-ji (1867) the popularity of Zen  began to wane, and for some thirty years remained in inactivity; but  since the Russo-Japanese War its revival has taken place.  And now it  is looked upon as an ideal faith, both for a nation full of hope and  energy, and for a person who has to fight his own way in the strife  of life.  Bushido, or the code of chivalry, should be observed not  only by the soldier in the battle-field, but by every citizen in the  struggle for existence.  If a person be a person and not a beast,  then he must be a Samurai-brave, generous, upright, faithful, and  manly, full of self-respect and self-confidence, at the same time  full of the spirit of self-sacrifice.  We can find an incarnation of  Bushido in the late General Nogi, the hero of Port Arthur, who, after  the sacrifice of his two sons for the country in the Russo-Japanese  War, gave up his own and his wife's life for the sake of the deceased  Emperor.  He died not in vain, as some might think, because his  simplicity, uprightness, loyalty, bravery, self-control, and  self-sacrifice, all combined in his last act, surely inspire the  rising generation with the spirit of the Samurai to give birth to  hundreds of Nogis.  Now let us see in the following chapters what Zen  so closely connected with Bushido teaches us.            CHAPTER III        THE UNIVERSE IS THE SCRIPTURE[FN#107] OF ZEN      1. Scripture is no More than Waste Paper.    [FN#107]  Zen is not based on any particular sutra, either of  Mahayana or of Hinayana.  There are twofold Tripitakas (or the three  collections of the Buddhist scriptures)-namely, the  Mahayana-tripitaka and the Hinayana-tripitaka.  The former are the  basis of the Mahayana, or the higher and reformed Buddhism, full of  profound metaphysical reasonings; while the latter form that of the  Hinayana, or the lower and early Buddhism, which is simple and  ethical teaching.  These twofold Tripitakas are as follows:    THE MAHAYANA-TRIPITAKA.    The Sutra Pitaka.-The Saddharma-pundarika-sutra,  Samdhi-nirmocana-sutra, Avatamsaka-sutra, Prajnyaparamita-sutra,  Amitayus-sutra, Mahaparinirvana-sutra, etc.    The Vinaya Pitaka.--Brahmajala-sutra, Bodhisattva-caryanirdeca, etc.    The Abhidharma Pitaka.--Mahaprajnyaparamita-sutra,  Mahayana-craddhotpada-castra, Madhyamaka-castra, Yogacarya  bhumi-castra, etc.    THE HINAYANA-TRIPITAKA.  The Sutra Pitaka.--Dirghagama, Ekottaragama, Madhyamagama,  Samyuktagama, etc.    The Vinaya Pitaka.--Dharmagupta-vinaya, Mahasamghika-vinaya,  Sarvastivada-vinaya, etc.    The Abhidharma Pitaka.--Dharma-skandha-pada, Samgiti-paryaya-pada,  Jnyanaprasthana-castra, Abhidharma-kosa-castra, etc.    The term 'Tripitaka,' however, was not known at the time of Shakya  Muni, and almost all of the northern Buddhist records agree in  stating that the Tripitaka was rehearsed and settled in the same year  in which the Muni died.  Mahavansa also says: \"The book called  Abhidharma-pitaka was compiled, which was preached to god, and was  arranged in due order by 500 Budhu priests.\"  But we believe that  Shakya Muni's teaching was known to the early Buddhists, not as  Tripitaka, but as Vinaya and Dharma, and even at the time of King  Acoka (who ascended the throne about 269 B.C.) it was not called  Tripitaka, but Dharma, as we have it in his Edicts.  Mahayanists  unanimously assert the compilation of the Tripitaka in the first  council of Rajagrha, but they differ in opinion as to the question  who rehearsed the Abhidharma; notwithstanding, they agree as for the  other respects, as you see in the following:    The Sutra Pitaka, compiled by Ananda; the Vinaya Pitaka, compiled by  Upali; the Abhidharma Pitaka, compiled by Ananda--according to  Nagarjuna (Mahaprajnyaparamita-castra).    The Sutra Pitaka, compiled by Ananda; the Vinaya Pitaka, compiled by  Upali; the Abhidharma Pitaka, compiled by Kacyapa according to Huen  Tsang (Ta-tan-si-yu-ki).    The Sutra Pitaka, compiled by Ananda; the Vinaya Pitaka, compiled by  Upali; the Abhidharma Pitaka, compiled by Purna--according to  Paramartha ('A Commentary on the History of the Hinayana Schools').    The above-mentioned discrepancy clearly betrays the uncertainty of  their assertions, and gives us reason to discredit the compilation of  Abhidharma Pitaka at the first council.  Besides, judging from the  Dharma-gupta-vinaya and other records, which states that Purna took  no part in the first council, and that he had different opinions as  to the application of the rules of discipline from that of Kacyapa,  there should be some errors in Paramartha's assertion.
