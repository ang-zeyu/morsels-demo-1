He always gave them a hogshead of beer; and they all drank  merrily to his health. And the citizens of Mons in Hainault, and  other gentlemen, his neighbours, came to see him for the wonder  of it, as a man come out of the grave; and from the time he was  well, he was never without company. When one went out, another  came in to visit him; his table was always well covered. He was  dearly loved both by the nobility and by the common people; as  for his generosity, so for his handsome face and his courtesy:  with a kind look and a gracious word for everybody, so that all  who saw him had perforce to love him.    The chief citizens of Mons came one Saturday, to beg him let me  go to Mons, where they wished to entertain me with a banquet, for  their love of him. He told them he would urge me to go, which he  did; but I said such great honour was not for me, moreover they  could not feast me better than he did. Again he urged me, with  much affection, to go there, to please him; and I agreed. The  next day, they came to fetch me with two carriages: and when we  got to Mons, we found the dinner ready, and the chief men of the  town, with their ladies, who attended me with great devotion. We  sat down to dinner, and they put me at the top of the table, and  all drank to me, and to the health of M. le Marquis d'Auret:  saying he was happy, and they with him, to have had me to put him  on his legs again; and truly the whole company were full of  honour and love for him. After dinner, they brought me back to  the Chateau d'Auret, where M. le Marquis was awaiting me; who  affectionately welcomed me, and would hear what we had done at  our banquet; and I told him all the company had drunk many times  to his health.    In six weeks he began to stand a little on crutches, and to put  on fat and get a good natural colour. He would go to Beaumont,  his brother's place; and was taken there in a carrying-chair, by  eight men at a time. And the peasants in the villages through  which we passed, knowing it was M. le Marquis, fought who should  carry him, and would have us drink with them; but it was only  beer. Yet I believe if they had possessed wine, even hippocras,  they would have given it to us with a will. And all were right  glad to see him, and all prayed God for him. When we came to  Beaumont, everybody came out to meet us and pay their respects to  him, and prayed God bless him and keep him in good health. We  came to the chateau, and found there more than fifty gentlemen  whom M. le Duc d'Ascot had invited to come and be happy with his  brother; and he kept open house three whole days. After dinner,  the gentlemen used to tilt at the ring and play with the foils,  and were full of joy at the sight of M. d'Auret, for they had  heard he would never leave his bed or be healed of his wound. I  was always at the upper end of the table, and everybody drank to  him and to me, thinking to make me drunk, which they could not;  for I drank only as I always do.    A few days later, we went back; and I took my leave of Mdme. la  Duchesse d'Ascot, who drew a diamond from her finger, and gave it  me in gratitude for my good care of her brother: and the diamond  was worth more than fifty crowns. M. d'Auret was ever getting  better, and was walking all alone on crutches round his garden.  Many times I asked him to let me go back to Paris, telling him  his physician and his surgeon could do all that was now wanted  for his wound: and to make a beginning to get away from him, I  asked him to let me go and see the town of Antwerp. To this he  agreed at once, and told his steward to escort me there, with two  pages. We passed through Malines and Brussels, where the chief  citizens of the town begged us to let them know of it when we  returned; for they too wished, like those of Mons, to have a  festival for me. I gave them very humble thanks, saying I did not  deserve such honour. I was two days and a half seeing the town of  Antwerp, where certain merchants, knowing the steward, prayed he  would let them have the honour of giving us a dinner or a supper:  it was who should have us, and they were all truly glad to hear  how well M. d' Auret was doing, and made more of me than I asked.    On my return, I found M. le Marquis enjoying himself: and five or  six days later I asked his leave to go, which he gave, said he,  with great regret. And he made me a handsome present of great  value, and sent me back, with the steward, and two pages, to my  house in Paris.    I forgot to say that the Spaniards have since ruined and  demolished his Chateau d' Auret, sacked, pillaged, and burned all  the houses and villages belonging to him: because he would not be  of their wicked party in their assassinations and ruin of the  Netherlands.    I have published this Apologia, that all men may know on what  footing I have always gone: and sure there is no man so touchy  not to take in good part what I have said. For I have but told  the truth; and the purport of my discourse is plain for all men  to see, and the facts themselves are my guarantee against all  calumnies.          ON THE MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD IN ANIMALS  BY WILLIAM HARVEY  TRANSLATED BY ROBERT WILLIS  AND REVISED BY ALEXANDER BOWIE      INTRODUCTORY NOTE      William Harvey, whose epoch-making treatise announcing and  demonstrating the ejaculation of the blood is here printed, was  born at Folkestone, Kent, England, April 1, 1578. He was educated  at the King's School, Canterbury, and at Gonville and Caius  College, Cambridge; and studied medicine on the Continent,  receiving the degree of M.D. from the University of Padua. He  took the same degree later at both the English universities.  After his return to England he became Fellow of the College of  Physicians, physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and Lumleian  lecturer at the College of Physicians. It was in this last  capacity that he delivered, in 1616, the lectures in which he  first gave public notice of his theories on the circulation of  the blood. The notes of these lectures are still preserved in the  British Museum.    In 1618 Harvey was appointed physician extraordinary to James I,  and he remained in close professional relations to the royal  family until the close of the Civil War, being present at the  battle of Edgehill. By mandate of Charles I, he was, for a short  time, Warden of Merton College, Oxford (1645-6), and, when he was  too infirm to undertake the duties, he was offered the Presidency  of the College of Physicians. He died on June 3, 1657.    Harvey's famous \"Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et  Sanguinis in Animalibus\" was published in Latin at Frankfort in  1628. The discovery was received with great interest, and in his  own country was accepted at once; on the Continent it won favor  more slowly. Before his death, however, the soundness of his  views was acknowledged by the medical profession throughout  Europe, and \"it remains to this day the greatest of the  discoveries of physiology, and its whole honor belongs to  Harvey.\"          DEDICATION    TO HIS VERY DEAR FRIEND, DOCTOR ARGENT, THE EXCELLENT AND  ACCOMPLISHED PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS, AND TO  OTHER LEARNED PHYSICIANS, HIS MOST ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES.      I have already and repeatedly presented you, my learned friends,  with my new views of the motion and function of the heart, in my  anatomical lectures; but having now for more than nine years  confirmed these views by multiplied demonstrations in your  presence, illustrated them by arguments, and freed them from the  objections of the most learned and skilful anatomists, I at  length yield to the requests, I might say entreaties, of many,  and here present them for general consideration in this treatise.    Were not the work indeed presented through you, my learned  friends, I should scarce hope that it could come out scatheless  and complete; for you have in general been the faithful witnesses  of almost all the instances from which I have either collected  the truth or confuted error. You have seen my dissections, and at  my demonstrations of all that I maintain to be objects of sense,  you have been accustomed to stand by and bear me out with your  testimony. And as this book alone declares the blood to course  and revolve by a new route, very different from the ancient and  beaten pathway trodden for so many ages, and illustrated by such  a host of learned and distinguished men, I was greatly afraid  lest I might be charged with presumption did I lay my work before  the public at home, or send it beyond seas for impression, unless  I had first proposed the subject to you, had confirmed its  conclusions by ocular demonstrations in your presence, had  replied to your doubts and objections, and secured the assent and  support of our distinguished President. For I was most intimately  persuaded, that if I could make good my proposition before you  and our College, illustrious by its numerous body of learned  individuals, I had less to fear from others. I even ventured to  hope that I should have the comfort of finding all that you  granted me in your sheer love of truth, conceded by others who  were philosophers like yourselves. True philosophers, who are  only eager for truth and knowledge, never regard themselves as  already so thoroughly informed, but that they welcome further  information from whomsoever and from wheresoever it may come; nor  are they so narrow-minded as to imagine any of the arts or  sciences transmitted to us by the ancients, in such a state of  forwardness or completeness, that nothing is left for the  ingenuity and industry of others. On the contrary, very many  maintain that all we know is still infinitely less than all that  still remains unknown; nor do philosophers pin their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5697"],[0,"Tales of Chinatown (#13)"],[1,"the man was waiting for something, listening  for some sound. As if to confirm this reasoning, just at that moment a  sound indeed broke the silence of the room.    Somewhere far away in the distance of the big house a gong was beaten  three times softly. Kerry's fierce glance searched the face of Zani  Chada, but it remained mask-like, immovable. Yet that this had been a  signal of some kind the Chief Inspector did not doubt, and:    \"You can't trick me,\" he said fiercely. \"No one can leave this house  without my knowledge, and because of what happened out there in the fog  my hands are untied.\"    He took up his hat and cane from the chair.    \"I'm going to search the premises,\" he declared.    Zani Chada stood up slowly.    \"Chief Inspector,\" he said, \"I advise you to do nothing until you have  consulted your wife.\"    \"Consulted my wife?\" snapped Kerry. \"What the devil do you mean?\"    \"I mean that any steps you may take now can only lead to disaster for  many, and in your own case to great sorrow.\"    Kerry took a step forward, two steps, then paused. He was considering  certain words which the Eurasian had spoken. Without fearing the man  in the physical sense, he was not fool enough to underestimate his  potentialities for evil and his power to strike darkly.    \"Act as you please,\" added Zani Chada, speaking even more softly. \"But  I have not advised lightly. I will receive you, Chief Inspector, at any  hour of the night you care to return. By to-morrow, if you wish, you may  be independent of everybody.\"    Kerry clenched his fists.    \"And great sorrow may be spared to others,\" concluded the Eurasian.    Kerry's teeth snapped together audibly; then, putting on his hat, he  turned and walked straight to the door.          V    DAN KERRY, JUNIOR        Dan Kerry, junior, was humorously like his father, except that he was  larger-boned and promised to grow into a much bigger man. His hair was  uncompromisingly red, and grew in such irregular fashion that the comb  was not made which could subdue it. He had the wide-open, fighting blue  eyes of the Chief Inspector, and when he smiled the presence of two  broken teeth lent him a very pugilistic appearance.    On his advent at the school of which he was now one of the most popular  members, he had promptly been christened \"Carrots.\" To this nickname  young Kerry had always taken exception, and he proceeded to display  his prejudice on the first day of his arrival with such force and  determination that the sobriquet had been withdrawn by tacit consent of  every member of the form who hitherto had favoured it.    \"I'll take you all on,\" the new arrival had declared amidst a silence of  stupefaction, \"starting with you\"--pointing to the biggest boy. \"If we  don't finish to-day, I'll begin again to-morrow.\"    The sheer impudence of the thing had astounded everybody. Young Kerry's  treatment of his leading persecutor had produced a salutary change of  opinion. Of such kidney was Daniel Kerry, junior; and when, some hours  after his father's departure on the night of the murder in the fog, the  'phone bell rang, it was Dan junior, and not his mother, who answered  the call.    \"Hallo!\" said a voice. \"Is that Chief Inspector Kerry's house?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Dan.    \"It has begun to rain in town,\" the voice continued, \"Is that the Chief  Inspector's son speaking?\"    \"Yes, I'm Daniel Kerry.\"    \"Well, my boy, you know the way to New Scotland Yard?\"    \"Rather.\"    \"He says will you bring his overall? Do you know where to find it?\"    \"Yes, yes!\" cried Dan excitedly, delighted to be thus made a party to  his father's activities.    \"Well, get it. Jump on a tram at the Town Hall and bring the overall  along here. Your mother will not object, will she?\"    \"Of course not,\" cried Dan. \"I'll tell her. Am I to start now?\"    \"Yes, right away.\"    Mrs. Kerry was sewing by the fire in the dining room when her son came  in with the news, his blue eyes sparkling excitedly. She nodded her head  slowly.    \"Ye'll want ye'r Burberry and ye'r thick boots,\" she declared, \"a  muffler, too, and ye'r oldest cap. I think it's madness for ye to go out  on such a night, but----\"    \"Father said I could,\" protested the boy.    \"He says so, and ye shall go, but I think it madness a' the same.\"    However, some ten minutes later young Kerry set out, keenly resenting  the woollen muffler which he had been compelled to wear, and secretly  determined to remove it before mounting the tram. Across one arm he  carried the glistening overall which was the Chief Inspector's constant  companion on wet nights abroad. The fog had turned denser, and ten paces  from the door of the house took him out of sight of the light streaming  from the hallway.    Mary Kerry well knew her husband's theories about coddling boys, but  even so could not entirely reconcile herself to the present expedition.  However, closing the door, she returned philosophically to her sewing,  reflecting that little harm could come to Dan after all, for he was  strong, healthy, and intelligent.    On went the boy through the mist, whistling merrily. Not twenty yards  from the house a coupe was drawn up, and by the light of one of its  lamps a man was consulting a piece of paper on which, presumably, an  address was written; for, as the boy approached, the man turned, his  collar pulled up about his face, his hat pulled down.    \"Hallo!\" he called. \"Can you please tell me something?\"    He spoke with a curious accent, unfamiliar to the boy. \"A foreigner of  some kind,\" young Kerry determined.    \"What is it?\" he asked, pausing.    \"Will you please read and tell me if I am near this place?\" the man  continued, holding up the paper which he had been scrutinizing.    Dan stepped forward and bent over it. He could not make out the writing,  and bent yet more, holding it nearer to the lamp. At which moment some  second person neatly pinioned him from behind, a scarf was whipped about  his head, and, kicking furiously but otherwise helpless, he felt himself  lifted and placed inside the car.    The muffler had been thrown in such fashion about his face as to leave  one eye partly free, and as he was lifted he had a momentary glimpse of  his captors. With a thrill of real, sickly terror he realized that he  was in the hands of Chinamen!    Perhaps telepathically this spasm of fear was conveyed to his father,  for it was at about this time that the latter was interviewing Zani  Chada, and at about this time that Kerry recognized, underlying the  other's words, at once an ill-concealed suspense and a threat. Then,  a few minutes later, had come the three strokes of the gong; and again  that unreasonable dread had assailed him, perhaps because it signalized  the capture of his son, news of which had been immediately telephoned to  Limehouse by Zani Chada's orders.    Certain it is that Kerry left the Eurasian's house in a frame of mind  which was not familiar to him. He was undecided respecting his next  move. A deadly menace underlay Chada's words.    \"Consult your wife,\" he kept muttering to himself. When the door was  opened for him by the Chinese servant, he paused a moment before going  out into the fog. There were men on duty at the back and at the front of  the house. Should he risk all and raid the place? That Lady Rourke was  captive here he no longer doubted. But it was equally certain that no  further harm would come to her at the hands of her captors, since she  had been traced there and since Zani Chada was well aware of the fact.  Of the whereabouts of Lou Chada he could not be certain. If he was in  the house, they had him.    The door was closed by the Chinaman, and Kerry stood out in the darkness  of the dismal, brick-walled street, feeling something as nearly akin  to dejection as was possible in one of his mercurial spirit. Something  trickled upon the brim of his hat, and, raising his head, Kerry detected  rain upon his upturned face. He breathed a prayer of thankfulness. This  would put an end to the fog.    He began to walk along by the high brick wall, but had not proceeded far  before a muffled figure arose before him and the light of an electric  torch was shone into his face.    \"Oh, it's you, Chief Inspector!\" came the voice of the watcher.    \"It is,\" rapped Kerry. \"Unless there are tunnels under this old  rat-hole, I take it the men on duty can cover all the exits?\"    \"All the main exits,\" was the reply. \"But, as you say, it's a strange  house, and Zani Chada has a stranger reputation.\"    \"Do nothing until you hear from me.\"    \"Very good, Chief Inspector.\"    The rain now was definitely conquering the fog, and in half the time  which had been occupied by the outward journey Kerry was back again in  Limehouse police station. Unconsciously he had been hastening his pace  with every stride, urged onward by an unaccountable anxiety, so that  finally he almost ran into the office and up to the desk where the  telephone stood.    Lifting it, he called his own number and stood tapping his foot,  impatiently awaiting the reply. Presently came the voice of the  operator: \"Have they answered yet?\"    \"No.\"    \"I will ring them again.\"    Kerry's anxiety became acute, almost unendurable; and when at last,  after repeated attempts, no reply could be obtained from his home, he  replaced the receiver and leaned for a moment on the desk, shaken with  such a storm of apprehension as he had rarely known. He turned to the  inspector in charge, and:    \"Let me have that envelope I left with you,\" he directed. \"And have  someone 'phone for a taxi; they are to keep on till they get one. Where  is Sergeant Durham?\"    \"At the mortuary.\"    \"Ah!\"    \"Any developments, Chief Inspector?\"    \"Yes. But apart from keeping a close watch upon the house of Zani Chada  you are to do nothing until you hear from me again.\"    \"Very good,\" said the inspector. \"Are you going to wait for Durham's  report?\"    \"No. Directly the cab"]]]
