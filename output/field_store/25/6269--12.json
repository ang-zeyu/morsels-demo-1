To enjoy this, no need to submit  myself ingloriously and with ignominy to the State and People of  Florence! And wherever I may be thrown, in any case I trust at least to  find daily bread.'    The cruelty and injustice of Florence to her greatest son have been the  subject of much eloquent blame. But, in justice to his contemporaries,  we must try to see Dante as they saw him, and bear in mind that the very  qualities fame makes so much of--his fervent temper and devotion to  great ideas--placed him out of the reach of common sympathy. Others  besides him had been banished from Florence, with as much or as little  reason, and had known the saltness of bread which has been begged, and  the steepness of strange stairs. The pains of banishment made them the  more eager to have it brought to a close. With Dante all that he  suffered went to swell the count of grievances for which a reckoning was  some day to be exacted. The art of returning was, as he himself knew  well, one he was slow to learn.[100] His noble obstinacy, which would  stoop to no loss of dignity or sacrifice of principle, must excite our  admiration; it also goes far to account for his difficulty in getting  back. We can even imagine that in Florence his refusal to abate one  tittle of what was due to him in the way of apology was, for a time, the  subject of wondering speculation to the citizens, ere they turned again  to their everyday affairs of politics and merchandise. Had they been  more used to deal with men in whom a great genius was allied to a  stubborn sense of honour, they would certainly have left less room in  their treatment of Dante for happier ages to cavil at.    How did the case stand? In the letter above quoted from, Dante says that  his innocence was known to all. As far as the charge of corruption in  his office-bearing went, his banishment--no one can doubt it for a  moment--was certainly unjust; and the political changes in Florence  since the death of Corso Donati had taken all the life out of the other  charges. But by his eager appeals to the Emperor to chastise the  Florentines he had raised fresh barriers against his return. The  governors of the Republic could not be expected to adopt his theory of  the Empire and share his views of the Imperial claims; and to them Dante  must have seemed as much guilty of disloyalty to the Commonwealth in  inviting the presence of Henry, as Corso Donati had been in Dante's eyes  for his share in bringing Charles of Valois to harry Florence. His  political writings since his exile--and all his writings were more or  less political--had been such as might well confirm or create an opinion  of him as a man difficult to live with, as one whose intellectual  arrogance had a ready organ in his unsparing tongue or pen. Rumour  would most willingly dwell upon and distort the features of his  character and conduct that separated him from the common herd. And to  add to all this, even after he had deserted the party of the Whites in  exile, and had become a party to himself, he found his friends and  patrons--for where else could he find them?--among the foes of Florence.      VI.    History never abhors a vacuum so much as when she has to deal with the  life of a great man, and for those who must have details of Dante's  career during the nineteen years which elapsed between his banishment  and his death, the industry of his biographers has exhausted every  available hint, while some of them press into their service much that  has only the remotest bearing on their hero. If even one-half of their  suppositions were adopted, we should be forced to the conclusion that  the _Comedy_ and all the other works of his exile were composed in the  intervals of a very busy life. We have his own word for this much,  (_Convito_ i. 3,) that since he was cast forth out of Florence--in which  he would 'fain rest his wearied soul and fulfil his appointed time'--he  had been 'a pilgrim, nay, even a mendicant,' in every quarter of  Italy,[101] and had 'been held cheap by many who, because of his fame,  had looked to find him come in another guise.' But he gives no journal  of his wanderings, and, as will have been observed, says no word of any  country but Italy. Keeping close to well-ascertained facts, it seems  established that in the earlier period of his exile he sojourned with  members of the great family of the Counts Guidi,[102] and that he also  found hospitality with the Malaspini,[103] lords of the Val di Magra,  between Genoa and Lucca. At a still earlier date (August 1306) he is  found witnessing a deed in Padua. It was most probably in the same year  that Dante found Giotto there, painting the walls of the Scrovegni  Chapel, and was courteously welcomed by the artist, and taken to his  house.[104] At some time of his life he studied at Bologna: John Villani  says, during his exile.[105] Of his supposed residence in Paris, though  it is highly probable, there is a want of proof; of a visit to England,  none at all that is worth a moment's consideration. Some of his  commentators and biographers seem to think he was so short-witted that  he must have been in a place before it could occur to him to name it in  his verse.    We have Dante's own word for it that he found his exile almost  intolerable. Besides the bitter resentment which he felt at the  injustice of it, he probably cherished the conviction that his career  had been cut short when he was on the point of acquiring great influence  in affairs. The illusion may have been his--one not uncommon among men  of a powerful imagination--that, given only due opportunity, he could  mould the active life of his time as easily as he moulded and fashioned  the creations of his fancy. It was, perhaps, owing to no fault of his  own that when a partial opportunity had offered itself, he failed to get  his views adopted in Florence; indeed, to judge from the kind of  employment in which he was more than once engaged for his patrons, he  must have been possessed of no little business tact. Yet, as when his  feelings were deeply concerned his words knew no restraint, so his hopes  would partake of the largeness of his genius. In the restored Empire,  which he was almost alone in longing for as he conceived of it, he may  have imagined for himself a place beside Henry like what in Frederick's  court had been filled by Pier delle Vigne--the man who held both keys to  the Emperor's heart, and opened and shut it as he would.[106]    Thus, as his exile ran on it would grow sadder with the accumulating  memories of hopes deferred and then destroyed, and of dreams which had  faded away in the light of a cheerless reality. But some consolations he  must have found even in the conditions of his exile. He had leisure for  meditation, and time enough to spend in that other world which was all  his own. With the miseries of a wanderer's life would come not a few of  its sweets--freedom from routine, and the intellectual stimulus supplied  by change of place. Here and there he would find society such as he  cared for--that of scholars, theologians, and men familiar with every  court and school of Christendom. And, beyond all, he would get access to  books that at home he might never have seen. It was no spare diet that  would serve his mind while he was making such ample calls on it for his  great work. As it proceeds we seem to detect a growing fulness of  knowledge, and it is by reason of the more learned treatment, as well as  the loftier theme of the Third Cantica, that so many readers, when once  well at sea in the _Paradiso_, recognise the force of the warning with  which it begins.[107]    What amount of intercourse he was able to maintain with Florence during  his wanderings is a matter of mere speculation, although of a more  interesting kind than that concerned with the chronology of his uneasy  travels. That he kept up at least some correspondence with his friends  is proved by the letter regarding the terms of his pardon. There is also  the well-known anecdote told by Boccaccio as to the discovery and  despatch to him of the opening Cantos of the _Inferno_--an anecdote we  may safely accept as founded on fact, although Boccaccio's informants  may have failed to note at the time what the manuscript consisted of,  and in the course of years may have magnified the importance of their  discovery. With his wife he would naturally communicate on subjects of  common interest--as, for instance, that of how best to save or recover  part of his property--and especially regarding the welfare of his sons,  of whom two are found to be with him when he acquires something like a  settlement in Verona.    It is quite credible that, as Boccaccio asserts, he would never after  his exile was once begun 'go to his wife or suffer her to join him where  he was;' although the statement is probably an extension of the fact  that she never did join him. In any case it is to make too large a use  of the words to find in them evidence, as has frequently been done, of  the unhappiness of all his married life, and of his utter estrangement  from Gemma during his banishment. The union--marriage of convenience  though it was--might be harmonious enough as long as things went  moderately well with the pair. Dante was never wealthy, but he seems to  have had his own house in Florence and small landed possessions in its  neighbourhood.[108] That before his banishment he was considerably in  debt appears to be ascertained;[109] but, without knowing the  circumstances in which he borrowed, it is impossible to be sure whether  he may not only have been making use of his credit in order to put out  part of his means to advantage in some of the numerous commercial  enterprises in which his neighbours were engaged. In any case his career  must have seemed full of promise till he was driven into banishment.  When that blow had"]]]
