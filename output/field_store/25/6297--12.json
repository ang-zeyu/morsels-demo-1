But his Holiness intimated, with reference to the future, that the  vassal of the Apostolic See had duties paramount to all foreign ties;  and that, since the rights of the Camera over that province admitted  of no compromise, he would do well to resign the service of the  Republic, and recall his consort to administer his affairs at home,  whilst he remained in Rome for the winter. To these suggestions the  Duke agreed, and wrote in most grateful terms to the government of  Venice, explaining the obstacles which had unexpectedly arisen to his  repaying at that moment the obligations he had incurred. We learn  from Sanuto that on the 10th of October the Duchess with her ladies  went into college, and being seated near the Doge, thanked the  Signory in her lord's name for the favour, command, and protection  granted to him, to which the Doge replied blandly, asserting the love  borne him by the Republic. Again, on the 15th of November, there came  into the cabinet of the Signory \"the Duchess of Urbino with Madonna  Emilia and her company of damsels to take leave, for she is departing  early to-morrow morning for her duchy; she goes in a barge by the Po  as far as Ravenna, and from thence on horseback: and the Doge spake  her fair, and having taken leave, we sages of the orders accompanied  her as far as the palace-gates, and she proceeded along the Mercery,  reaching home on the 2d of December.\"    Borgia took the opportunity of Guidobaldo's visit to make advances  for a reconciliation, having reason to dread his influence with  the Pope. These were received with courtesy; but, in the words of  the Venetian chronicler just quoted, \"the Duke was resolved to  have his own again, especially the library, which was promised  him without damage, with the tapestries, although the Cardinal of  Rouen had already got a good share of them.\" According to Baldi's  elaborate and somewhat too dramatic description of their interview,  he magnanimously forgave the extraordinary injuries he had received  from his now humbled adversary. On the authority of private letters,  an anonymous diary, already noticed, states that the usurper threw  himself, cap-in-hand, at the Duke's feet, beseeching mercy and  pardon, and excusing his conduct on the plea of youth, the brutality  of his father, and the persuasions of others. This incident was  represented in a fresco by Taddeo Zucchero, which I saw at Cagli in  1843, and which had been cut from the villa built at S. Angelo in  Vado, by Duke Guidobaldo II. Cesare is a slight figure handsomely  dressed, with long sharp features, a high nose and reddish hair. He  kneels before the Duke of Urbino, raising his cap, whilst one notary  appears to read aloud an act of surrender, and another makes an  instrument upon the transaction.[18]    [Footnote 18: Considering that Borgia was probably dead half a  century before this painting was commissioned, little reliance can be  placed upon the likeness. *This is the account alluded to in note *1,  page 29.]    Even after Valentino had given authority for a surrender of the  citadels in Romagna, they were held by his officers upon the plea  that he was not a free agent, and the bearer of his missive was  hanged by the castellan of Cesena. At length the Pope ordered  Guidobaldo to reduce them by force. For this purpose he named  him gonfaloniere of the Church, retaining him and four hundred  men-at-arms, with a year's pay of 7000 ducats in advance. It was  about this time that he was invested with the insignia of the Garter,  to which illustrious order he had been elected in February. His  acquisition of this dignity, and Count Baldassare Castiglione's  mission to London as proxy at his installation, form an episode of  so much interest to an English reader that we have gleaned every  possible notice of these events, and have arranged them in II. of the  Appendix.    The Duke left Rome for his command, accompanied by his nephew the  Prefettino, as he was then usually called from his youth, who had  returned from France three months before to wait upon his Holiness.  They were attended by Castiglione, who, after charming Julius by  his polished society, was permitted by him to transfer his services  to the court of Guidobaldo, of which he became the ornament and  commentator. On the 1st of June they reached Urbino, and found the  Duchess re-established among an attached people, who, to drive away  sad recollections of their recent sufferings, had amused her during  the preceding carnival with scenic imitations of the principal events  of the usurpation! One of these was the comedy (so called rather  in a Dantesque than a comic sense) of the Duke Valentino and Pope  Alexander VI. In it were successively represented their plotting the  seizure of the state, their sending the Lady Lucrezia to Ferrara,  their inviting the Duchess to her wedding, the invasion of the duchy,  the duke's first return, and his redeparture, the massacre of the  confederates, the death of the Pope, and the Duke's restoration to  his rights.    The garrisons of Cesena and Bertinoro had surrendered ere Guidobaldo  took the field, that of Forli came to terms as soon as his troops  appeared. With it passed the last wreck of the Borgian substantial  power and vast ambition, within a year from the death of Alexander,  leaving to future times no memorial but a name doomed to lasting  execration. Guidobaldo had at the same time the satisfaction of  recovering most of the valuables that had been pillaged from his  palace, estimated by him at not less than 100,000 ducats, especially  a large proportion of his father's celebrated library.    On the 6th of September the Duke retraced his steps to Urbino, and  there at length renewed the long-suspended joys of his secure and  tranquil residence. Few, perhaps, of their rank and age, less needed  such rough discipline to inculcate moderation, than this exemplary  couple. Yet must the lessons of adversity have been ordained for some  purifying purpose, and we may indulge the hope that they were not  sent in vain. The Duke devoted his earliest leisure to signalise his  gratitude for the unflinching loyalty of his subjects by conferring  upon their several municipalities various privileges and immunities,  and remitting their fiscal arrears. The Duchess expressed her  thankfulness by many works of piety, by liberal charities, and by  instituting a three days' fair on the anniversary of her lord's  restoration. Their domestic circle was agreeably enlarged by the  arrival of the Lady Prefectess, as the widow of Giovanni delle Rovere  was entitled, who, on returning from a similar exile, and after  paying her reverence to her brother-in-law the Pope, hastened to join  her son at her brother's court. We have noticed the services which  when assailed by Valentino, she received from Andrea Doria; they  were now acknowledged by Guidobaldo with the castle of Sassocorbaro,  and other holdings. Another guest at Urbino was Sigismondo Varana,  the young heir of Camerino, who arrived with his mother Maria, sister  of the Prefettino, and with his uncle and guardian Giovanni Maria,  who afterwards supplanted him in that state.    Urbino was now enlivened by an event which proved of paramount  interest to its sovereign, and was destined by providence to carry  forward its independence and glories under a new dynasty. We have  seen how it had been proposed between the Cardinal della Rovere and  Guidobaldo, in 1498, that the latter should adopt the young Prefect  as his heir, and procure from the Pope a renewal of the Dukedom and  investitures to his favour.[19] The simulated sanction of Alexander  to this arrangement led to no result; but, as soon as Julius was  fixed in the seat of St. Peter, he took measures for placing his  nephew's prospects beyond question. In the natural course of events  the state of Urbino would lapse to the Holy See on the Duke's death,  and, as the uniform policy of this Pontiff was to unite to it as many  such fiefs as the failure of their seigneurs or the force of his  arms brought within his grasp, his making an exception of the most  valuable of them all in favour of his own nephew gave rise to not a  few strictures. It is, however, the only instance in which nepotism  can be laid to his charge, and the precedents left him by recent  Popes may be pleaded in justification of a comparatively trifling  abuse.    [Footnote 19: See vol. I., p. 371.]    On the 14th of September the Archbishop of Ragusa arrived at  Urbino as papal nuncio, charged with brieves for the completion  of this affair, and also with the ensigns of command for the Duke  as generalissimo of the ecclesiastical troops. The ceremonials  consequent upon the implement of his mission have been detailed by  Baldi, and are characteristic of the times we are endeavouring  to depict. The nuncio and his splendid suite were received with  distinction, and next day, being Sunday, was fixed for Guidobaldo's  installation. The whole court and principal inhabitants being  assembled in the cathedral, high mass was performed by him, after  which, standing in front of the altar, he laid aside his mitre, and  pronounced a solemn benediction on the two standards of the Church,  which were held furled by a canon, whilst he waved incense over them,  and sprinkled them with holy water. This ended, he desired them to  be mounted on their staves, and having sat down and resumed his  mitre, he presented them to the Duke, who received them, devoutly  kneeling on the altar-steps, and handed one to Ottaviano Fregoso, the  other to Morello d'Ortona. He then received the baton, with the like  ceremonies, and rose,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/443"],[0,"The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac (#13)"],[1,"dicine,  travel, biography--everything that came to his net was fish!    \"This is the third time Mr. Gladstone has visited me,\" said the  bookseller, \"and this is the third time he has cleaned me out.\"    \"This man is a good man,\" says I to myself.  \"So notable a lover of  books surely cannot err.  The cause of home rule must be a just one  after all.\"    From others intimately acquainted with him I learned that Gladstone was  an omnivorous reader; that he ordered his books by the cart-load, and  that his home in Hawarden literally overflowed with books.  He made a  practice, I was told, of overhauling his library once in so often and  of weeding out such volumes as he did not care to keep.  These  discarded books were sent to the second-hand dealers, and it is said  that the dealers not unfrequently took advantage of Gladstone by  reselling him over and over again (and at advanced prices, too) the  very lots of books he had culled out and rejected.    Every book-lover has his own way of buying; so there are as many ways  of buying as there are purchasers.  However, Judge Methuen and I have  agreed that all buyers may be classed in these following specified  grand divisions:        The reckless buyer.        The shrewd buyer.        The timid buyer.    Of these three classes the third is least worthy of our consideration,  although it includes very many lovers of books, and consequently very  many friends of mine.  I have actually known men to hesitate, to  ponder, to dodder for weeks, nay, months over the purchase of a book;  not because they did not want it, nor because they deemed the price  exorbitant, nor yet because they were not abundantly able to pay that  price.  Their hesitancy was due to an innate, congenital lack of  determination--that same hideous curse of vacillation which is  responsible for so much misery in human life.    I have made a study of these people, and I find that most of them are  bachelors whose state of singleness is due to the fact that the same  hesitancy which has deprived them of many a coveted volume has operated  to their discomfiture in the matrimonial sphere.  While they  deliberated, another bolder than they came along and walked off with  the prize.    One of the gamest buyers I know of was the late John A. Rice of  Chicago.  As a competitor at the great auction sales he was invincible;  and why?  Because, having determined to buy a book, he put no limit to  the amount of his bid.  His instructions to his agent were in these  words:  \"I must have those books, no matter what they cost.\"    An English collector found in Rice's library a set of rare volumes he  had been searching for for years.    \"How did you happen to get them?\" he asked.  \"You bought them at the  Spencer sale and against my bid.  Do you know, I told my buyer to bid a  thousand pounds for them, if necessary!\"    \"That was where I had the advantage of you,\" said Rice, quietly.  \"I  specified no limit; I simply told my man to buy the books.\"    The spirit of the collector cropped out early in Rice.  I remember to  have heard him tell how one time, when he was a young man, he was  shuffling over a lot of tracts in a bin in front of a Boston bookstall.  His eye suddenly fell upon a little pamphlet entitled \"The Cow-Chace.\"  He picked it up and read it.  It was a poem founded upon the defeat of  Generals Wayne, Irving, and Proctor.  The last stanza ran in this wise:        And now I've closed my epic strain,      I tremble as I show it,      Lest this same warrior-drover, Wayne,      Should ever catch the poet.      Rice noticed that the pamphlet bore the imprint of James Rivington, New  York, 1780.  It occurred to him that some time this modest tract of  eighteen pages might be valuable; at any rate, he paid the fifteen  cents demanded for it, and at the same time he purchased for ten cents  another pamphlet entitled \"The American Tories, a Satire.\"    Twenty years later, having learned the value of these exceedingly rare  tracts, Mr. Rice sent them to London and had them bound in Francis  Bedford's best style--\"crimson crushed levant morocco, finished to a  Grolier pattern.\"  Bedford's charges amounted to seventy-five dollars,  which with the original cost of the pamphlets represented an  expenditure of seventy-five dollars and twenty-five cents upon Mr.  Rice's part.  At the sale of the Rice library in 1870, however, this  curious, rare, and beautiful little book brought the extraordinary sum  of seven hundred and fifty dollars!    The Rice library contained about five thousand volumes, and it realized  at auction sale somewhat more than seventy-two thousand dollars.  Rice  has often told me that for a long time he could not make up his mind to  part with his books; yet his health was so poor that he found it  imperative to retire from business, and to devote a long period of time  to travel; these were the considerations that induced him finally to  part with his treasures.  \"I have never regretted having sold them,\" he  said. \"Two years after the sale the Chicago fire came along.  Had I  retained those books, every one of them would have been lost.\"    Mrs. Rice shared her husband's enthusiasm for books.  Whenever a new  invoice arrived, the two would lock themselves in their room, get down  upon their knees on the floor, open the box, take out the treasures and  gloat over them, together!  Noble lady! she was such a wife as any good  man might be proud of.  They were very happy in their companionship on  earth, were my dear old friends. He was the first to go; their  separation was short; together once more and forever they share the  illimitable joys which await all lovers of good books when virtue hath  mournfully writ the colophon to their human careers.    Although Mr. Rice survived the sale of his remarkable library a period  of twenty-six years, he did not get together again a collection of  books that he was willing to call a library.  His first collection was  so remarkable that he preferred to have his fame rest wholly upon it.  Perhaps he was wise; yet how few collectors there are who would have  done as he did.    As for myself, I verily believe that, if by fire or by water my library  should be destroyed this night, I should start in again to-morrow upon  the collection of another library.  Or if I did not do this, I should  lay myself down to die, for how could I live without the companionships  to which I have ever been accustomed, and which have grown as dear to  me as life itself?    Whenever Judge Methuen is in a jocular mood and wishes to tease me, he  asks me whether I have forgotten the time when I was possessed of a  spirit of reform and registered a solemn vow in high heaven to buy no  more books.  Teasing, says Victor Hugo, is the malice of good men;  Judge Methuen means no evil when he recalls that weakness--the one  weakness in all my career.    No, I have not forgotten that time; I look back upon it with a shudder  of horror, for wretched indeed would have been my existence had I  carried into effect the project I devised at that remote period!    Dr. O'Rell has an interesting theory which you will find recorded in  the published proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (vol.  xxxiv., p. 216).  Or, if you cannot procure copies of that work, it may  serve your purpose to know that the doctor's theory is to this  effect--viz., that bibliomania does not deserve the name of bibliomania  until it is exhibited in the second stage. For secondary bibliomania  there is no known cure; the few cases reported as having been cured  were doubtless not bibliomania at all, or, at least, were what we of  the faculty call false or chicken bibliomania.    \"In false bibliomania, which,\" says Dr. O'Rell, \"is the primary stage  of the grand passion--the vestibule to the main edifice--the usual  symptoms are flushed cheeks, sparkling eyes, a bounding pulse, and  quick respiration.  This period of exaltation is not unfrequently  followed by a condition of collapse in which we find the victim pale,  pulseless, and dejected.  He is pursued and tormented of imaginary  horrors, he reproaches himself for imaginary crimes, and he implores  piteously for relief from fancied dangers.  The sufferer now stands in  a slippery place; unless his case is treated intelligently he will  issue from that period of gloom cured of the sweetest of madnesses, and  doomed to a life of singular uselessness.    \"But properly treated,\" continues Dr. O'Rell, \"and particularly if his  spiritual needs be ministered to, he can be brought safely through this  period of collapse into a condition of reenforced exaltation, which is  the true, or secondary stage of, bibliomania, and for which there is no  cure known to humanity.\"    I should trust Dr. O'Rell's judgment in this matter, even if I did not  know from experience that it was true.  For Dr. O'Rell is the most  famous authority we have in bibliomania and kindred maladies.  It is he  (I make the information known at the risk of offending the ethics of  the profession)--it is he who discovered the bacillus librorum, and,  what is still more important and still more to his glory, it is he who  invented that subtle lymph which is now everywhere employed by the  profession as a diagnostic where the presence of the germs of  bibliomania (in other words, bacilli librorum) is suspected.    I once got this learned scientist to inject a milligram of the lymph  into the femoral artery of Miss Susan's cat.  Within an hour the  precocious beast surreptitiously entered my library for the first time  in her life, and ate the covers of my pet edition of Rabelais.  This  demonstrated to Dr. O'Rell's satisfaction the efficacy of his  diagnostic, and it proved to Judge Methuen's satisfaction what the  Judge has always maintained--viz., that Rabelais was an old rat.        XII    THE PLEASURES OF EXTRA-ILLUSTRATION    Very many years ago we became convinced--Judge Methuen and I did--that "]]]
