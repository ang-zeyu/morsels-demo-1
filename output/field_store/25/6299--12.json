[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/444"],[0,"System of Economical Contradictions; Or, The Philosophy of Misery (#13)"],[1,"the accidents of commerce and the  division of interests: two things which must ultimately receive  their interpretation.  Let me explain myself.    Considering producer and consumer as a single individual, whose  recompense is naturally equal to his product; then dividing this  product into two parts, one which rewards the producer for his  outlay, another which represents his profit, according to the  axiom that all labor should leave an excess,--we have to  determine the relation of one of these parts to the other.  This  done, it will be easy to deduce the ratio of the fortunes of  these two classes of men, employers and wage-laborers, as well  as account for all commercial oscillations.  This will be a  series of corollaries to add to the demonstration.    Now, that such a relation may exist and be estimated, there must  necessarily be a law, internal or external, which governs wages  and prices; and since, in the present state of things, wages and  prices vary and oscillate continually, we must ask what are the  general facts, the causes, which make value vary and oscillate,  and within what limits this oscillation takes place.    But this very question is contrary to the accepted principles;  for whoever says OSCILLATION necessarily supposes a mean  direction toward which value's centre of gravity continually  tends; and when the Academy asks that we DETERMINE THE  OSCILLATIONS OF PROFIT AND WAGES, it asks thereby that we  DETERMINE VALUE.  Now that is precisely what the gentlemen of  the Academy deny: they are unwilling to admit that, if value is  variable, it is for that very reason determinable; that  variability is the sign and condition of determinability.  They  pretend that value, ever varying, can never be determined.  This  is like maintaining that, given the number of oscillations of a  pendulum per second, their amplitude, and the latitude and  elevation of the spot where the experiment is performed, the  length of the pendulum cannot be determined because the pendulum  is in motion.  Such is political economy's first article of  faith.    As for socialism, it does not appear to have understood the  question, or to be concerned about it.  Among its many organs,  some simply and merely put aside the problem by substituting  division for distribution,--that is, by banishing number and  measure from the social organism: others relieve themselves of  the embarrassment by applying universal suffrage to the wages  question.  It is needless to say that these platitudes find dupes  by thousands and hundreds of thousands.    The condemnation of political economy has been formulated by  Malthus in this famous passage:--      A man who is born into a world already occupied, his family  unable to support him, and society not requiring his labor,--such  a man, I say, has not the least right to claim any nourishment  whatever: he is really one too many on the earth.  At the great  banquet of Nature there is no plate laid for him.  Nature  commands him to take himself away, and she will not be slow to  put her order into execution.[6]      [6 The passage quoted may not be given in the exact words used by  Malthus, it having reached its present shape through the medium  of a French rendering--Translator.        This then is the necessary, the fatal, conclusion of political  economy,--a conclusion which I shall demonstrate by evidence  hitherto unknown in this field of inquiry,--Death to him who does  not possess!    In order better to grasp the thought of Malthus, let us translate  it into philosophical propositions by stripping it of its  rhetorical gloss:--    \"Individual liberty, and property, which is its expression, are  economical data; equality and solidarity are not.    \"Under this system, each one by himself, each one for himself:  labor, like all merchandise, is subject to fluctuation: hence the  risks of the proletariat.    \"Whoever has neither income nor wages has no right to demand  anything of others: his misfortune falls on his own head; in the  game of fortune, luck has been against him.\"    From the point of view of political economy these propositions  are irrefutable; and Malthus, who has formulated them with such  alarming exactness, is secure against all reproach.  From the  point of view of the conditions of social science, these same  propositions are radically false, and even contradictory.    The error of Malthus, or rather of political economy, does not  consist in saying that a man who has nothing to eat must die; or  in maintaining that, under the system of individual  appropriation, there is no course for him who has neither labor  nor income but to withdraw from life by suicide, unless he  prefers to be driven from it by starvation: such is, on the one  hand, the law of our existence; such is, on the other, the  consequence of property; and M. Rossi has taken altogether too  much trouble to justify the good sense of Malthus on this point.  I suspect, indeed, that M. Rossi, in making so lengthy and loving  an apology for Malthus, intended to recommend political economy  in the same way that his fellow-countryman Machiavel, in his book  entitled \"The Prince,\" recommended despotism to the  admiration of the world.  In pointing out misery as the necessary  condition of industrial and commercial absolutism, M. Rossi seems  to say to us:  There is your law, your justice, your political  economy; there is property.    But Gallic simplicity does not understand artifice; and it would  have been better to have said to France, in her immaculate  tongue:  The error of Malthus, the radical vice of political  economy, consists, in general terms, in affirming as a definitive  state a transitory condition,-- namely, the division of society  into patricians and proletaires; and, particularly, in saying  that in an organized, and consequently solidaire, society, there  may be some who possess, labor, and consume, while others have  neither possession, nor labor, nor bread.  Finally Malthus, or  political economy, reasons erroneously when seeing in the faculty  of indefinite reproduction--which the human race enjoys in  neither greater nor less degree than all animal and vegetable  species--a permanent danger of famine; whereas it is only  necessary to show the necessity, and consequently the existence,  of a law of equilibrium between population and production.    In short, the theory of Malthus--and herein lies the great merit  of this writer, a merit which none of his colleagues has dreamed  of attributing to him--is a reductio ad absurdum of all political  economy.    As for socialism, that was summed up long since by Plato and  Thomas More in a single word, UTOPIA,--that is, NO-PLACE, a  chimera.    Nevertheless, for the honor of the human mind and that justice  may be done to all, this must be said: neither could economic and  legislative science have had any other beginning than they  did have, nor can society remain in this original position.    Every science must first define its domain, produce and collect  its materials: before system, facts; before the age of art, the  age of learning.  The economic science, subject like every other  to the law of time and the conditions of experience, before  seeking to ascertain how things OUGHT TO TAKE PLACE in society,  had to tell us how things DO TAKE PLACE; and all these processes  which the authors speak of so pompously in their books as LAWS,  PRINCIPLES, and THEORIES, in spite of their incoherence and  inconsistency, had to be gathered up with scrupulous diligence,  and described with strict impartiality.  The fulfilment of this  task called for more genius perhaps, certainly for more  self-sacrifice, than will be demanded by the future progress of  the science.    If, then, social economy is even yet rather an aspiration towards  the future than a knowledge of reality, it must be admitted that  the elements of this study are all included in political economy;  and I believe that I express the general sentiment in saying that  this opinion has become that of the vast majority of minds.  The  present finds few defenders, it is true; but the disgust with  utopia is no less universal: and everybody understands that the  truth lies in a formula which shall reconcile these two terms:  CONSERVATION and MOTION.    Thus, thanks to Adam Smith, J. B. Say, Ricardo, and Malthus, as  well as their rash opponents, the mysteries of fortune, atria  Ditis, are uncovered; the power of capital, the oppression of the  laborer, the machinations of monopoly, illumined at all points,  shun the public gaze.  Concerning the facts observed and  described by the economists, we reason and conjecture:  abusive laws, iniquitous customs, respected so long as the  obscurity which sustained their life lasted, with difficulty  dragged to the daylight, are expiring beneath the general  reprobation; it is suspected that the government of society must  be learned no longer from an empty ideology, after the fashion of  the Contrat social, but, as Montesquieu foresaw, from the  RELATION OF THINGS; and already a Left of eminently socialistic  tendencies, composed of savants, magistrates, legists,  professors, and even capitalists and manufacturers,--all born  representatives and defenders of privilege,--and of a million of  adepts, is forming in the nation above and outside of  PARLIAMENTARY opinions, and seeking, by an analysis of economic  facts, to capture the secrets of the life of societies.    Let us represent political economy, then, as an immense plain,  strewn with materials prepared for an edifice.  The laborers  await the signal, full of ardor, and burning to commence the  work: but the architect has disappeared without leaving the plan.    The economists have stored their memories with many things:  unhappily they have not the shadow of an estimate.  They know the  origin and history of each piece; what it cost to make it; what  wood makes the best joists, and what "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44414"],[0,"The Mormon Prophet and His Harem (#13)"],[1,"       necessity. I trust this necessity will not occur. I have come       among you with no prejudices or enmities; and by the exercise       of a just and firm administration I hope to command your       confidence.         \"Freedom of conscience, and the use of your own peculiar mode       of serving God, are sacred rights, the exercise of which is       guaranteed by the Constitution, and with which it is not the       province of the Government or the disposition of its       representatives in this Territory to interfere. In virtue of       my authority as commander-in-chief of the military of this       Territory, I hereby command all armed bodies of individuals,       by whomsoever organized, to disband, and return to their       respective homes.         \"The penalty of disobedience to this command will subject the       offenders to the punishment due to traitors.         \"A. CUMMING,         \"_Governor of Utah Territory_.\"    During this time the Mormon troops were busy stealing stock, burning  supply-trains, and in every way weakening and embarrassing the United  States forces. Being familiar with the country, they had greatly the  advantage; and could break suddenly upon a herding party, from some side  canyon, capture their stock, and before the alarm could be given, be  safely ensconced in their own quarters. Much valuable stock was acquired  in this way.         \"Forts Bridger and Supply were vacated and burned down. Orders       were issued by Daniel H. Wells (Lieut.-General Nauvoo Legion,)       to stampede the animals of the United States troops on their       march, to set fire to their trains, to burn the grass and the       whole country before them and on their flanks, to keep them       from sleeping by night surprises, and to block the roads by       felling trees, and destroying the fords of rivers.         \"On the 4th of October, 1857, the Mormons, under Capt. Lot       Smith, captured and burned, on Green River, three of our       supply trains, consisting of seventy-five wagons, loaded with       provisions and tents for the army, and carried away several       hundred animals.\"    Late in the fall of 1857 \"the Army of Utah\" arrived at Bridger, and made  an encampment, which was called Camp Scott.    As the winter was severe, and the snow very deep, little progress was  made by the army in quelling the Mormon rebellion, while much suffering  was endured by the soldiers. Some time during the winter of 1857-58 Col.  Kane set out for Utah, to ascertain, if possible, the exact state of  affairs in that Territory. He was not sent as the agent of the  Government, as is generally supposed, but his mission was approved by  President Buchanan, and the War Department. He went _incognito_, and by  the southern route, and arrived in Utah in the month of January. He was  accompanied by a servant only, and while on the desert to the south of  Salt Lake City, was taken sick, and came near losing his life. Amasa  Lyman and others were out exploring, with a view of ascertaining whether  the Mormons could be attacked from the south. They found Col. Kane and  his man on the desert. Lyman took him into his carriage, \"laid hands on  him, and administered unto him.\" Kane still remained unknown to him, but  told him that he had business of importance to transact at Salt  Lake,--important both to the Mormons and to the nation. He was  immediately taken to Salt Lake, where, for the first time, he made known  his business and his name.    Brigham was agreeably surprised to find an old friend and _quasi_ Mormon  in his guest, and of course treated him with the greatest consideration.  It was well understood at Salt Lake that Col. Kane was baptized by the  Elders some years before, while on a tour of exploration to the Rocky  Mountains.[52:A] How much of Mormonism he imbibed is not known, but  certain it is, that the saints rely on his aid and influence, under all  circumstances.    The negotiations were of the most friendly character, and Kane proceeded  soon after, in his character as pacificator, to the \"Head-quarters of  the Army of Utah,\" at Fort Bridger. He was escorted by Porter Rockwell,  and Daniel Kimball past the limits of the Mormon camp. He held  interviews with the officers of the army and with Governor Cumming, and  succeeded in inducing the Governor to accompany him to Salt Lake.    Of this journey Governor Cumming says:--         \"I left camp on the 5th, _en route_ for this city, accompanied       by Col. Kane, as guide, and two servants. . . . I was escorted       from Bear River Valley to the western end of Echo Canyon,--the       journey through the canyon being performed, for the most part,       in the night; it was about eleven o'clock when I arrived at       Weber Station.         \"I have been everywhere recognized as the Governor of Utah,       and, so far from having encountered insults and indignities, I       am gratified in being able to state that, in passing through       the settlements, I have been universally greeted with such       respectful attentions as are due to the representative of the       executive authority of the United States. . . .         \"When it was arranged with the Mormon officer in command of my       escort that I should pass through Echo Canyon in the night, I       inferred that it was with the object of concealing the       barricades and other defences. I was therefore agreeably       surprised by an illumination in honor to me. The bonfires       kindled by the soldiers, from the base to the summit of the       hills, completely illuminated the valley, and disclosed the       snow-covered mountains which surrounded us.\"    The following is the Mormon account of the _entree_ of Governor Cumming  into the Valley of Salt Lake, and may go to explain to him why the  journey was made through Echo Canyon in the night.    Upon entering the Mormon lines they were rejoined by Rockwell and  Kimball, who commanded the Governor's escort to Salt Lake City. Echo  Canyon is a narrow pass, about eighteen miles in length, and commands  the entrance to Salt Lake Valley from the east. The Mormons had  fortified this canyon at several points. They also had four camps, or  places of rendezvous, at convenient distances. Upon arriving at Cache  Cave, the first \"post,\" the party of the Governor came to a halt. His  Excellency was escorted into camp with due honor, and an ox was slain to  celebrate the occasion. After partaking of a sumptuous repast, the  troops were ordered out for the Governor to review. About 150 men were  \"drawn up,\" and after the review, the Governor \"made a speech.\" He  complimented \"the boys\" on their order, discipline, and skill.    Col. Kimball then proceeded to read various orders to the troops.  Various imaginary companies were ordered to relieve various other  imaginary companies. Several new posts were ordered to be established,  and others abandoned. Meanwhile, the Governor, _not to be deceived_, was  noting down the different companies as they were called. This done, they  again took the road. It was now about sundown; and as they passed the  stations, the troops were arranged on each side of the road, to salute  the Governor, and be reviewed by him. Everything passed off smoothly  until they reached the third station, when it suddenly occurred to Col.  Kimball that the pickets at that post had not been apprised of their  coming. He remarked, on nearing the camp, that \"he saw no pickets, and  he guessed the boys were in ambush.\" He therefore mounted a horse, and  telling the driver to be sure and \"halt\" as soon as he heard the word,  rode off. In a moment more, the guard shouted, \"Halt! who goes  there?\"--and before a reply could be given, the crack of a rifle was  heard. The Governor, trembling with fright, cried out, \"I am your  friend, the Governor of Utah; don't fire, boys; for God's sake, don't  fire!\" \"I know nothing about Governors, nor anybody else,\" replied the  picket; \"I must do my duty. This way, Sergeant of the Guard.\" By this  time quite a company rode up, and, as the Governor supposed, he was  about to be taken prisoner. Col. Kimball now appeared, explained the  whole matter, and relieved his Excellency from his embarrassing  position. But the Governor was entirely innocent of the joke, and  believes, to this day, that he had a hair-breadth escape.    They then passed on to the mouth of Echo Canyon, where the troops were  again reviewed; and as the party bivouacked for the night, hundreds of  camp-fires gleamed along the rugged sides of the canyon, furnishing  incontestable evidence of the great number of the Mormon soldiers. There  were at this time about 150 men, all told, in the canyon, and _these the  Governor had reviewed at every station_.    The next morning the Governor proceeded on his journey, prepared to  assert that the Mormons had from two to three thousand men under arms in  and near Echo Canyon. When the company arrived at Sessions, ten miles  from Salt Lake City, they were met by a large concourse of citizen  soldiery, preceded by a band of music, accompanied by the roaring of  cannon. The Echo Canyon boys were also there, to see the fun. The  Governor was quite bewildered by all this parade, and made up his mind  that the Mormons were very numerous, and both ready and willing to \"wipe  out\" the handful of Government soldiers, whenever they could get  permission from their leader.    Upon arriving at the \"Holy City,\" the best lodgings and the best brandy  were provided for his Excellency. Brigham called in due time, and paid  his compliments; invited Governor Cumming to his office, and tendered to  him \"the hospitalities of the city.\" Governor Cumming was delighted, and  in a few days called at the office of Governor Young. This wily  personage put on one of his blandest smiles, resigned his office of  Governor, turned over the papers and documents of the office to his  legal successor, and, to crown all,"]]]
