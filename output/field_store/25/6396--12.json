Once or twice Jos  had been on the point of saying something very important to her, to  which she was most willing to lend an ear, but the fat fellow could not  be brought to unbosom himself of his great secret, and very much to his  sister's disappointment he only rid himself of a large sigh and turned  away.    This mystery served to keep Amelia's gentle bosom in a perpetual  flutter of excitement.  If she did not speak with Rebecca on the tender  subject, she compensated herself with long and intimate conversations  with Mrs. Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, who dropped some hints to the  lady's-maid, who may have cursorily mentioned the matter to the cook,  who carried the news, I have no doubt, to all the tradesmen, so that  Mr. Jos's marriage was now talked of by a very considerable number of  persons in the Russell Square world.    It was, of course, Mrs. Sedley's opinion that her son would demean  himself by a marriage with an artist's daughter.  \"But, lor', Ma'am,\"  ejaculated Mrs. Blenkinsop, \"we was only grocers when we married Mr.  S., who was a stock-broker's clerk, and we hadn't five hundred pounds  among us, and we're rich enough now.\" And Amelia was entirely of this  opinion, to which, gradually, the good-natured Mrs. Sedley was brought.    Mr. Sedley was neutral.  \"Let Jos marry whom he likes,\" he said; \"it's  no affair of mine.  This girl has no fortune; no more had Mrs. Sedley.  She seems good-humoured and clever, and will keep him in order,  perhaps.  Better she, my dear, than a black Mrs. Sedley, and a dozen of  mahogany grandchildren.\"    So that everything seemed to smile upon Rebecca's fortunes.  She took  Jos's arm, as a matter of course, on going to dinner; she had sate by  him on the box of his open carriage (a most tremendous \"buck\" he was,  as he sat there, serene, in state, driving his greys), and though  nobody said a word on the subject of the marriage, everybody seemed to  understand it.  All she wanted was the proposal, and ah! how Rebecca  now felt the want of a mother!--a dear, tender mother, who would have  managed the business in ten minutes, and, in the course of a little  delicate confidential conversation, would have extracted the  interesting avowal from the bashful lips of the young man!    Such was the state of affairs as the carriage crossed Westminster  bridge.    The party was landed at the Royal Gardens in due time. As the majestic  Jos stepped out of the creaking vehicle the crowd gave a cheer for the  fat gentleman, who blushed and looked very big and mighty, as he walked  away with Rebecca under his arm.  George, of course, took charge of  Amelia.  She looked as happy as a rose-tree in sunshine.    \"I say, Dobbin,\" says George, \"just look to the shawls and things,  there's a good fellow.\" And so while he paired off with Miss Sedley,  and Jos squeezed through the gate into the gardens with Rebecca at his  side, honest Dobbin contented himself by giving an arm to the shawls,  and by paying at the door for the whole party.    He walked very modestly behind them.  He was not willing to spoil  sport.  About Rebecca and Jos he did not care a fig.  But he thought  Amelia worthy even of the brilliant George Osborne, and as he saw that  good-looking couple threading the walks to the girl's delight and  wonder, he watched her artless happiness with a sort of fatherly  pleasure.  Perhaps he felt that he would have liked to have something  on his own arm besides a shawl (the people laughed at seeing the gawky  young officer carrying this female burthen); but William Dobbin was  very little addicted to selfish calculation at all; and so long as his  friend was enjoying himself, how should he be discontented? And the  truth is, that of all the delights of the Gardens; of the hundred  thousand extra lamps, which were always lighted; the fiddlers in cocked  hats, who played ravishing melodies under the gilded cockle-shell in  the midst of the gardens; the singers, both of comic and sentimental  ballads, who charmed the ears there; the country dances, formed by  bouncing cockneys and cockneyesses, and executed amidst jumping,  thumping and laughter; the signal which announced that Madame Saqui was  about to mount skyward on a slack-rope ascending to the stars; the  hermit that always sat in the illuminated hermitage; the dark walks, so  favourable to the interviews of young lovers; the pots of stout handed  about by the people in the shabby old liveries; and the twinkling  boxes, in which the happy feasters made-believe to eat slices of almost  invisible ham--of all these things, and of the gentle Simpson, that  kind smiling idiot, who, I daresay, presided even then over the  place--Captain William Dobbin did not take the slightest notice.    He carried about Amelia's white cashmere shawl, and having attended  under the gilt cockle-shell, while Mrs. Salmon performed the Battle of  Borodino (a savage cantata against the Corsican upstart, who had lately  met with his Russian reverses)--Mr. Dobbin tried to hum it as he walked  away, and found he was humming--the tune which Amelia Sedley sang on  the stairs, as she came down to dinner.    He burst out laughing at himself; for the truth is, he could sing no  better than an owl.    It is to be understood, as a matter of course, that our young people,  being in parties of two and two, made the most solemn promises to keep  together during the evening, and separated in ten minutes afterwards.  Parties at Vauxhall always did separate, but 'twas only to meet again  at supper-time, when they could talk of their mutual adventures in the  interval.    What were the adventures of Mr. Osborne and Miss Amelia? That is a  secret.  But be sure of this--they were perfectly happy, and correct in  their behaviour; and as they had been in the habit of being together  any time these fifteen years, their tete-a-tete offered no particular  novelty.    But when Miss Rebecca Sharp and her stout companion lost themselves in  a solitary walk, in which there were not above five score more of  couples similarly straying, they both felt that the situation was  extremely tender and critical, and now or never was the moment Miss  Sharp thought, to provoke that declaration which was trembling on the  timid lips of Mr. Sedley.  They had previously been to the panorama of  Moscow, where a rude fellow, treading on Miss Sharp's foot, caused her  to fall back with a little shriek into the arms of Mr. Sedley, and this  little incident increased the tenderness and confidence of that  gentleman to such a degree, that he told her several of his favourite  Indian stories over again for, at least, the sixth time.    \"How I should like to see India!\" said Rebecca.    \"SHOULD you?\" said Joseph, with a most killing tenderness; and was no  doubt about to follow up this artful interrogatory by a question still  more tender (for he puffed and panted a great deal, and Rebecca's hand,  which was placed near his heart, could count the feverish pulsations of  that organ), when, oh, provoking! the bell rang for the fireworks, and,  a great scuffling and running taking place, these interesting lovers  were obliged to follow in the stream of people.    Captain Dobbin had some thoughts of joining the party at supper: as, in  truth, he found the Vauxhall amusements not particularly lively--but he  paraded twice before the box where the now united couples were met, and  nobody took any notice of him.  Covers were laid for four.  The mated  pairs were prattling away quite happily, and Dobbin knew he was as  clean forgotten as if he had never existed in this world.    \"I should only be de trop,\" said the Captain, looking at them rather  wistfully.  \"I'd best go and talk to the hermit,\"--and so he strolled  off out of the hum of men, and noise, and clatter of the banquet, into  the dark walk, at the end of which lived that well-known pasteboard  Solitary.  It wasn't very good fun for Dobbin--and, indeed, to be alone  at Vauxhall, I have found, from my own experience, to be one of the  most dismal sports ever entered into by a bachelor.    The two couples were perfectly happy then in their box: where the most  delightful and intimate conversation took place.  Jos was in his glory,  ordering about the waiters with great majesty.  He made the salad; and  uncorked the Champagne; and carved the chickens; and ate and drank the  greater part of the refreshments on the tables. Finally, he insisted  upon having a bowl of rack punch; everybody had rack punch at Vauxhall.  \"Waiter, rack punch.\"    That bowl of rack punch was the cause of all this history.  And why not  a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause? Was not a bowl of  prussic acid the cause of Fair Rosamond's retiring from the world? Was  not a bowl of wine the cause of the demise of Alexander the Great, or,  at least, does not Dr. Lempriere say so?--so did this bowl of rack  punch influence the fates of all the principal characters in this  \"Novel without a Hero,\" which we are now relating.  It influenced their  life, although most of them did not taste a drop of it.    The young ladies did not drink it; Osborne did not like it; and the  consequence was that Jos, that fat gourmand, drank up the whole  contents of the bowl; and the consequence of his drinking up the whole  contents of the bowl was a liveliness which at first was astonishing,  and then became almost painful; for he talked and laughed so loud as to  bring scores of listeners round the box, much to the confusion of the  innocent party within it; and, volunteering to sing a song (which he  did in that maudlin high key peculiar to gentlemen in an inebriated  state), he almost drew away the audience who were gathered round the  musicians in the gilt scollop-shell, and received from his hearers a  great deal of applause.    \"Brayvo, Fat un!\" said one; \"Angcore, Daniel Lambert!\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#13)"],[1," tea, barrels of sugar and rice, hundreds of yards of candle-wick,  flower-seeds, reels of cotton, and many other miscellaneous articles.  But through all our pleasant, happy little bustle ran the constant  thought: \"What shall we do for more country?\" A day or two before  the expiration of the week's leave of absence which we always gave  ourselves, F---- came into my sitting-room at the hotel, flung down his  hat on the table with an air of triumph, and cried, \"I've heard of such  a splendid run! One hundred thousand acres of beautiful sheep-country,  and going for a mere song!\" Now I had lived long enough in the world  to discover that one sometimes danced on the wrong foot to the tune  of these \"mere songs,\" so I cautiously inquired, \"Where is it?\" F----  seemed a little dashed that the only question which he could not answer  favourably should be the first I asked, and he replied vaguely, \"Well,  it is rather a long way off, but I am sure we can manage it.\" A  little more sifting elicited the fact that this \"desirable investment\"  stretched along the shores of Lake Wanaka, famous for its beautiful  scenery, and was to be had for what certainly seemed a ridiculously  small sum;--only a few hundred pounds. \"Of course it has no sheep on  it,\" added F----; \"but that is all the better. I'll burn it this year,  and then turn some cattle on it, and after next shearing we'll have a  good mob of sheep to draft out and stock it.\" He further added, that  he had invited his man of business and the individual who owned this  magnificent property to dine with us that evening, and that then I  should hear all about it And I may truly say that I _did_ hear about  it, for my brain reeled with figures and calculations. By bedtime I was  wondering if we could possibly spend the enormous fortune which would  be quite certain to accrue to us in a few years if only we could make up  our minds to invest the modest balance at our bankers in this tempting  bargain. I remember well that I found myself wishing we were not going  to be _quite_ so rich; half our promised income would have been ample, I  thought. My anxieties on that score turned out to have been, to say the  least, premature.    Not to make my story too long, I may briefly say that after making due  allowance for the natural exaggeration of the owner, the run on Lake  Wanaka's shores seemed certainly to offer many attractions. Besides  thousands of acres of beautiful sheltered sheep country, it was said to  possess a magnificent bush, in which sawyers were already hard at work.  Of course all this timber would become our own, and we were to make  so much a year by selling it. \"How about the carriage?\" inquired F----  cautiously, having visions of costly bullock-drays, and teams and  drivers at fabulous wages. \"Oh, the lake is your highway,\" replied the  would-be seller, airily; \"you have nothing to do but lash your felled  trees together, as they do in the mahogany-growing countries, and set  them afloat on the lake, they will thus form a natural raft, and cost  you little or nothing to get down to a good market. You know the Dunstan  diggings are just at the foot of the lake, and they haven't a stick  there; timber is very badly wanted in those parts, not only for fuel and  building, but also for slabbing the shafts which the miners sink.\"    By the time the coffee was served F---- had made up his mind to buy the  Lake Wanaka run; his business agent urging him strongly not to hesitate  for a moment in securing such a chance. The negotiations reached thus  far without the least hitch, but at this point F----said, \"Well, I'll  tell you what I'll do: we will start in a day or two and go straight up  to this run and look round it, and if I find it anything like so good as  you both make it out, I'll buy it on the spot.\"    Never did that sociable little word \"we\" sound so delightful to my ears!  \"Then I am to come too,\" I thought to myself, but I prudently concealed  from the company that I had ever had any misgivings on that point.  However, the company did not concern themselves with my doubts  and fears, for our two guests seemed much taken aback at this very  matter-of-fact proposal of F----'s. \"That won't do at all, my dear  fellow,\" said the owner of the run; \"I am going to England by the  next mail steamer, which you know sails next week, and the reason I am  literally giving away my property is that I don't want any suspense or  bother. Take it or leave it, just as you like. There's Wilkinson and  Fairwright and a lot of others all clamouring for the refusal of it,  and I've only waited to see if you really wanted it before closing with  Fairwright. He is walking about with a cheque all ready filled up in his  pocket, and only begging and praying me to let him have the run on my  own terms. Why you might be weather-bound or kept there for a month,  and what shall I do then? No, its all just as I've told you, and you can  call it your own to-morrow, but I can't possibly wait for you to go and  look at it.\" No words of mine can give any idea of the tone of scorn in  which our guest pronounced these last three words; as if looking at an  intended purchase was at once the meanest and most absurd thing in-the  world. F---- seemed half ashamed of himself for his proposal, but still  he urged that he never liked to take a leap in the dark, backing up his  opinion by several world-revered adages. \"That's all very fine,\" chimed  in our precious business adviser,\" but this transaction can hardly be  said to be in the dark; here are the plans and the Government lease and  the transfer deeds, all regular and ready.\" With this he produced the  plans, and then it was all up with us. Who does not know the peculiar  _smell_ of tracing-paper, with its suggestions of ownership? When  these fresh and crackling drawings were opened before us they resembled  nothing so much as a veritable paradise. There shone the lake--a  brilliant patch of cobalt blue, bordered by outlines of vivid green  pasture and belts of timber. Here and there, on the outskirts, we read  the words, \"proposed township,\" \"building lots,\" \"probable gold fields,\"  \"saw mills.\" F---- laid his hand down over a large wash of light green  paint and asked,\" Now what sort of country is this; really and truly,  you know?\" \"First class sheep country, I give you my word,\" replied the  owner eagerly, \"only wants to be stocked for a year or two.\"    Why need I go on? It was the old, old story of misplaced confidence.  Neither F---- nor I could believe that our friends would wilfully  over-reach us, so it was settled that the first thing next morning the  money should be handed over and the Government lease transferred to us.  We decided that as we were so far on the way to our new property, we  would go and look at it before returning to the Malvern Hills, and  the next few days were very busy ones, as we had to arrange our small  domestic affairs, send up the dray, etc., etc. I felt rather anxious at  the postponement of our return home, for I had left several \"clutches\"  of eggs on the point of being hatched, and I had grave misgivings as to  the care my expected ducklings and chickens would receive at the lands  of my scatter-brained maid servants, to say nothing of the dangers  besetting them from hawks and rats. However, small interests must give  way to great ones, and F---- and I were already tasting the cares of  proprietorship. Our friend, the former owner of our new property, sailed  for England in the mail steamer, in high spirits, saying cordially as he  shook F----'s hand at parting, \"Well you _have_ got your fortune cut out  for you, and no mistake; I feel half sorry already to think that I've  parted with that run.\" About two days after his departure, F---- who had  registered his name at the land office as the present tenant of 100,000  acres in the Lake Wanaka district, received a polite request from  official quarters to pay up the annual rent, just due, amounting to 100  pounds or so. We had effected our brilliant negotiations about a week  too soon it seemed, but that was our own fault, so we had nothing to  do but pay the money with as good a grace as possible. I am \"free to  confess\" that this second cheque ran our banker's account very fine  indeed, but still in those palmy days of the past this was no subject of  uneasiness to a squatter. His credit was almost unlimited, and he could  always raise as much money as he liked on an hypothecation of  next year's wool. But we had not come to that yet. The weather was  delightful; the customary week of heavy rain just after our midsummer  Christmas, had cooled the air and laid the dust, besides bringing out a  fresh spring-like green tint over the willows and poplars, and causing  even the leaves of the gums to lose their leather-like look for a few  days.    After much consultation we decided to go by coach as far as Timaru, and  then trust to circumstances to decide our future means of transport. Not  only were we obliged to pay a large sum for our places but our luggage  was charged for by the pound, so we found it necessary to reduce our  kit to the most modest dimensions, and only to take what was absolutely  necessary. The journey was a long and weary one, the only variety being  caused by a strong spice of danger at each river. At some streams we  were transferred bodily to a large raft-like ferry boat, and so taken  across. At others the passengers and luggage only were put into the  boat, the lumbering coach with its leathern springs left behind, whilst  the horses swam in our wake across the wide and rushing river, to  be re-harnessed to another coach on the opposite shore. The Rakaia,  Ashburton, and Rangitata had been crossed in this way, and we had  reached the Otaio, a smaller river, when we found a new mode of  transport awaiting us. A large dray with a couple of powerful horses was  in readiness, and into this springless vehicle we were"]]]
