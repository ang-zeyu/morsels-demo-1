It was, and here is the secret--her mother's  wonderful table!    The war had brought ruinous, financial losses to most Virginia  families. As a result, Ruth's mother had been taught, in minute  detail, the high art of the best cookery of the first families of  Virginia. And how she could cook, or make the colored cook cook! The  Rivers' table had, for years, been the standard of the county-seat.  Mrs. Rivers' spiced hams, fig preserves, brandied plum-pudding,  stuffed roast-duck, fruit salads, all made by recipes handed down  through several generations, could not be excelled in richness and  toothsomeness. No simple dishes were known at the Rivers' table;  these, for those poor mortals who knew not the inner art. Double  cream, stimulating seasonings, sauces rarely spiced, the sort that  recreate worn-out appetites, were never lacking at a Rivers' meal.  Ruth had been overfed, had been wrongly fed since babyhood.    The expert said hope lay in taking her back to babyhood and feeding  her for days as though she were a four months' child. He said she must  be taught to eat; that her salvation lay in a few foods of plebeian  simplicity, foods which almost any one could get anywhere, foods which  did not involve long hours of preparation according to priceless  recipes. He said also that certain other foods were vicious, such  matter-of-course foods on the Rivers' table, foods which Mrs. Rivers  would have felt humiliated to omit from a meal of her ordering, and he  insisted that these must be lastingly denied this young woman with  prematurely exhausted, digestive glands. The process of her  reeducation, succinctly expressed as it was in a few sentences, called  for tedious months of care, of denial and of effort. It demanded that  which was more than taxing in many details. So for Ruth Rivers long  weeks were spent in a hospital-bed. She was fed on the simplest of  foods, each feeding measured with the same care as were her few  medicines, for now truly her food was medicine, and her chief medicine  was food. Massage seemed at last to bring help, for even in bed she  gained in strength.    It was several weeks before her mind was entirely clear, but she was  soon being taught the science of food; this included an understanding  outline of food chemistry, of the processes of digestion, of food  values, of the relation of food to work, of the vital importance of  muscular activity and the relation of muscle-use to nervous health.  Her beloved sweets and her strong coffee, the only friends of her  suffering days, were gradually buried even from thought in this  accumulation of new and understood truths--most reasonable and sane  truths. Forty pounds she gained in twelve weeks. She had never weighed  over one hundred and twenty-five. She has never weighed less than one  hundred and forty-five since, and, as she is five feet eight, her one  hundred and forty-five pounds brought her a new symmetry which, with  her high-bred face, transformed the waxen invalid into an attractive  beauty. She learned to do manual work. She learned to use every muscle  the Lord had given her, every day she lived. An appetite unwhipped by  condiments or unstimulated by artifice, an appetite for wholesome  food, has made eating a satisfaction she never knew in the old days.    This was ten years ago. Many changes have come in the Rivers'  household, the most far-reaching of which is probably the revolution  which shook its culinary department from center to circumference. What  saved daughter must be good for them all. Father is less portly, more  active, less ruddy. Some of the color he lost was found by the mother.  Aunt Melissa disappears into her gloom-days but rarely, and has  smiling hours unthought in the past. And Ruth has proven that the  mystery was adequately solved. She married the kind of man so  excellent a woman should have, and went through the trying weeks of  her motherhood and has cared for her boy through the demanding months  of early childhood without a complication. And all this in the face of  Aunt Melissa's reiterated forebodings!          CHAPTER IX    THE MAN WITH THE HOE      In the early years of the eighteenth century, a hardy family lived  frugally and simply on a few, fertile Norman acres. Their home was but  a hut of stone and clay and thatch. It was surrounded by a carefully  attended vineyard and fruit trees which, in the springtime, made the  spot most beautiful. On this May day the passerby would have stopped  that he might carry away this scene of perfect pastoral charm. The  blossoming vines almost hid the house, the blooming trees perfumed the  morning breeze, and it all spoke for simple peace and contentment. But  at this hour neither peace nor contentment could have been found  within. Pierre, the eldest son, was almost fiercely resenting the  quiet counsel of his father and the tearful pleadings of his mother.  Pierre loved Adrienne, their neighbor's daughter. The two had grown up  side by side, each had brought to the other all that their dreams had  wished through the years of waiting. Pierre had long worked extra  hours and they both had saved and now, nearing thirty, there was  enough, and they could marry. But the edict had gone forth that  Huguenot marriages would no longer be recognized by the state; that  the children of such a union would be without civil standing. So  Pierre and Adrienne had decided to leave France, nor did the protests  of their elders delay their going. It was a solemn little ceremony,  their marriage, a ceremony practically illegal in their land. Rarely  are weddings more solemn or bridal trips more sad, for to England they  were starting that same day, never to see their dear France again,  never to prune or to gather in the little vineyard, never again to  look into the faces of their own kin.    It was not a worldly-wise change. Wages in England were very low and  there were no vineyards in that chilly land, and Pierre worked and  died a plain English farm-hand, blessed only with health, remarkable  strength, and a wretched, but happy home. Much of their parents'  sturdiness and independence was passed on into the blood of their four  children, two boys and two girls, for in 1748, after long saving, they  all left England for America, \"the promised land,\" and sailed for New  Amsterdam. Husbandmen they were, and for two generations painfully,  gravely, they tilled the semi-productive soil of their little farm,  west of the Hudson. Land was cheap in the New World. Their vegetables  and fruit grew, the market in the city grew, and the van der Veere  farms grew, and peace and contentment abode there.    After the War of 1812 two healthy, robust van der Veere brothers  tramped into New York City each carrying in his bundle nearly  $1000.00, his share of their father's recently divided farm. They  started a green-grocery shop. One attended the customers, the other,  through the summer months, worked their little truck garden away out  on the country road, a road which is to-day New York's Great White  Way. They prospered. One married, and his two boys founded the van der  Veere firm of importers. From the East this company's ship, later its  ships, brought rare curios, oriental tapestries and fine rugs to make  elegant the brown-stone front drawing-rooms of aristocratic,  residential New York of that generation. The sons of one of these  brothers to-day constitute the honorable van der Veere firm. The other  brother left one son, Clifford, and two daughters, Dora and Henrietta.  It is into the life-history of Clifford van der Veere that we now  intrude. He was a sturdy youth, with no illnesses, save occasional  sore throats which left him when he shed his tonsils. His father was a  reserved, kindly man, a quietly efficient man. His competitors never  understood the sure growth of his success--he was so unpretentious in  all that he did. Clifford's mother was a sensible woman, untouched by  the pride of wealth and the snobbery of station. Their home, facing  Central Park, stood for elegance and restraint. There were no other  children for ten years after the son's birth, then came the two  sisters, which domestic arrangement probably proved an important  factor in deciding the rest of our story. From early boyhood Clifford  was orderly, obedient, studious and quietly industrious. He made no  trouble for parents or teachers--other mothers always spoke of him as  \"good.\" He was thirteen when his only sinful escapade happened. Some  of the Third Avenue boys shared the playgrounds in the park with  Clifford's crowd. They all smoked, some chewed and the more self-  important of them swore, and thereby, one day, our Fifth Avenue young  hopeful was contaminated. It was a savory-smelling wad of fine-cut. It  burned, a little went the wrong way and it strangled, but the joy of  ejecting a series of amber projectiles was Clifford's. Another  mouthful was ready for exhibition purposes when some appreciative  admirer enthusiastically clapped our boy between the shoulder-blades  and most of his mouth's contents, fluid and solid, was swallowed.  Somehow Clifford got home, but landed in a wilted heap on the big  couch, chalk-white, and sick beyond expression. The doctor was called  and, discovering the cause, made him helpfully sicker. The next  morning Clifford's father gravely offered to give him $500.00, when he  was twenty-one, if he would not taste tobacco again until that time.  Either the memory of first-chew sensations or the doctor's ipecac, or  the force of habit, or something, kept him from ever tasting it again.    Later, Clifford went to Columbia and was quietly popular with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#13)"],[1,"was      this beautiful expression, buried with one of their ancient dead,      \"May the Lord have mercy on me a Nephite.\" It was translated a      little differently, viz., \"Nephel.\" Now we well know that Nephi,      who came out of Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ, was      the leader of the first Jewish [Israelitish--Lehi's colony was      made up of families from the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim. See      Vol. I., pages 167-8.] colony across to this land, and the people,      ever afterwards, were called \"Nephites,\" after their inspired      prophet and leader. The Nephites were a righteous people and had      many prophets among them; and when they were burying one of their      brethren in these ancient mounds, they introduced the Hebrew      characters signifying \"May the Lord have mercy on me, a Nephite.\"      This is another direct evidence of the divine authenticity of      the Book of Mormon, which was brought forth and translated by      inspiration some thirty-five years before this inscription was      found.

It may be objected that this Newark Tablet with the Ten  Commandments written upon it in ancient Hebrew, can be of no value  as evidence for the Book of Mormon, since that book was engraved in  characters called \"reformed Egyptian.\" That is to say, it was written  in Egyptian characters somewhat altered by the Nephites in the course  of time--such changes take place in all written languages. But the  Nephites also wrote, to a limited extent, at least (and it would  most probably be in such cases as making a transcript of the Ten  Commandments), in Hebrew (See Mormon ix, 32, 33). Hence the importance  of the Newark Tablet as an ancient Nephite relic.    13. Journal of Discourses, Vol. XIII., p. 131, the discourse was  delivered April 10th, 1870, Salt Lake City.    14.

I.    _The Cincinnati Gold Plate._    Other discoveries of ancient American records, though evidently not  of Hebrew origin, should also be recorded, since they bear important  testimony to the fact that the ancient Americans did engrave records  on metallic plates. One of these records was found in the state of  Ohio, the other in Illinois. The first is the discovery of a gold plate  with raised characters engraven upon it, near Cincinnati, under the  following circumstances:        Mr. Benjamin E. Styles of Cincinnati, Ohio, while excavating the      earth for a cistern, in the year 1847, found, a few feet above      high water mark on the Ohio river, a gold plate. It was thrown      out with the loose earth while excavating about nine feet beneath      the surface. Said plate is of fine gold, three or four inches in      length, averaging about three-fourths of an inch in width, about      one-eighth of an inch in thickness, with the edges scolloped. In      the face of which was beautifully set another plate of the same      material, and fastened together by two pins, running through both.      This latter plate is full of ancient raised characters, beautifully      engraved upon its surface; the whole exhibiting fine workmanship.      The plate was examined by Dr. Wise, a very learned Rabbi of the      Jewish synagogue in Cincinnati, and editor of a Hebrew paper there,      who pronounced the characters to be mostly ancient Egyptian.    Such was the description of the circumstances under which the discovery  was made, and of the plate itself, by Elder Parley P. Pratt, to whom  Mr. Styles exhibited the plate, and related the circumstances of  its discovery. Elder Pratt communicated the facts to the \"Mormon,\"  published in New York, in a letter bearing date of January 1st, 1857.   [1] A cut of the relic was afterwards made and published by Drake and  Co., of St. Louis, printers, and with it the following certificate was  given:        We do hereby certify that we did print from a gold plate, the above      fac-simile, handed to us by Mr. Benjamin Styles, which he said he      found while digging for a cistern in Cincinnati, Ohio.        No. 1 is a frame of gold containing a thin plate, No. 2, and      appears to have been executed by a very superior workman.        DRAKE AND CO., PRINTERS,        Saint Louis, Missouri. [2]    II.    _The Kinderhook Plates._    The Illinois discovery is summarized as follows from the \"Quincy Whig,\"  a paper published in Quincy, Illinois:        SINGULAR DISCOVERY. MATERIAL FOR ANOTHER MORMON BOOK.        A young man by the name of Wiley, a resident in Kinderhook, Pike      county, went by himself and labored diligently one day in pursuit      of a supposed treasure, by sinking a hole in the centre of a      mound. Finding it quite laborious, he invited others to assist      him. A company of ten or twelve repaired to the mound and assisted      in digging out the shaft commenced by Wiley. After penetrating      the mound about eleven feet, they came to a bed of limestone      that had been subjected to the action of fire. They removed the      stones, which were small and easy to handle, to the depth of two      feet more, when they found six brass plates, secured and fastened      together by two iron wires, but which were so decayed that they      readily crumbled to dust upon being handled. The plates were so      completely covered with rust as almost to obliterate the characters      inscribed upon them, but, after undergoing a chemical process,      the inscriptions were brought out plain and distinct. There were      six plates, four inches in length, one inch and three-quarters      wide at the top and two inches and three-quarters wide at the      bottom, flaring out to points. There are four lines of characters      or hieroglyphics on each. On one side of the plates are parallel      lines running lengthways. By whom these plates were deposited there      must ever remain a secret, unless some one skilled in deciphering      hieroglyphics may be found to unravel the mystery. Some pretend to      say that Smith, the Mormon leader, has the ability to read them.      If he has, he will confer a great favor on the public by removing      the mystery which hangs over them. A person present when the plates      were found remarked that it would go to prove the authenticity of      the Book of Mormon, which it undoubtedly will. In the place where      these plates were deposited were also found human bones in the last      stage of decomposition. There were but a few bones found; and it is      believed that it was but the burial place of a person or family of      distinction in ages long gone by, and that these plates contain the      history of the times, or of a people that existed far, far beyond      the memory of the present race. But we will not conjecture anything      about discovery, as it is one which the plates alone can reveal.      The plates above alluded to were exhibited in this city last week,      and are now, we understand, in Nauvoo, subject to the inspection of      the Mormon Prophet. The public curiosity is greatly excited; and if      Smith can decipher the hieroglyphics on the plates, he will do more      towards throwing light on the early history of this continent than      any man now living. [3]    In a communication to the \"Times and Seasons\" (Nauvoo, Illinois), the  following testimony concerning the discovery was given:        On the 16th of April last, a respectable merchant, by the name of      Robert Wiley, commenced digging in a large mound near this place:      He excavated to the depth of ten feet and came to rock. About that      time the rain began to fall, and he abandoned the work. On the      23rd, he and quite a number of the citizens, with myself, repaired      to the mound; and after making ample opening, we found plenty of      rock the most of which appeared as though it had been strongly      burned; and after removing full two feet of said rock, we found      plenty of charcoal and ashes; also human bones that appeared as      though they had been burned; and near the encophalon a bundle was      found that consisted of six plates of brass of a bell shape, each      having a hole near the small end, and a ring through them all, and      clasped with two clasps. The rings and clasps appeared to be iron      very much oxydated. The plates appeared first to be copper, and      had the appearance of being covered with characters. It was agreed      by the company that I should cleanse the plates. Accordingly I      took them to my house washed them with soap and water and a woolen      cloth, but, finding them not yet cleansed, I treated them with      dilute sulphuric acid, which made them perfectly clean, on which it      appeared that"]]]
