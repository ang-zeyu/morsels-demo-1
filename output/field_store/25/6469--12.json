There were  soft, warm, swaddling bands, tiny socks, and long white linen dresses. A  baptismal blanket, covered with silk, was made for the christening, and  daintily embroidered. Plenty of lace, and pink and blue ribbons--pink  for a girl and blue for a boy--were kept at hand. And, because there  might be twins, a double set of garments was provided, besides baby  bathtubs and all sorts of nice things for the little stranger or  strangers--whether one or two--to come. Even the names were chosen--one  for a boy and the other for a girl. Would it be Wilhelm or Wilhelmina?    It was real fun to think over the names, but it was hard to choose out  of so many. At last, the Countess crossed off all but forty-six; or the  following; nearly every girl's name ending in _je_, as in our  \"Polly,\" \"Sallie.\"           _Girls_                        _Boys_      Magtel        Catharyna         Gerrit          Gysbert    Nelletje      Alida             Cornelis        Jausze    Zelia         Annatje           Volkert         Myndert    Jannetje      Christina         Kilian          Adrian    Zara          Katrina           Johannes        Joachim    Marytje       Bethje            Petrus          Arendt    Willemtje     Eva               Barent          Dirck    Geertruy      Dirkje            Wessel          Nikolaas    Petronella    Mayken            Hendrik         Staats    Margrieta     Hilleke           Teunis          Gozen    Josina        Bethy             Wouter          Willemtje                                    Japik           Evert    But before the sun set on the expected day, it was neither one boy nor  one girl, nor both; nor were all the forty-six names chosen sufficient;  for the beggar woman's wish had come true, in a way not expected. There  were as many as, and no fewer children than, there were days in the  year; and, since this was leap year, there were three hundred and  sixty-six little folks in the house; so that other names, besides the  forty-six, had to be used.    Yet none of these wee creatures was bigger than a mouse. Beginning at  daylight, one after another appeared--first a girl and then a boy; so  that after the forty-eighth, the nurse was at her wit's end, to give  them names. It was not possible to keep the little babies apart. The  thirty-one servant maids of the mansion were all called in to help in  sorting out the girls from the boys; but soon it seemed hopeless to try  to pick out Peter from Henry, or Catalina from Annetje. After an hour or  two spent at the task, and others coming along, the women found that it  was useless to try any longer. It was found that little Piet, Jan and  Klaas, Hank, Douw and Japik, among the boys; and Molly, Mayka, Lena,  Elsje, Annatje and Marie were getting all mixed up. So they gave up the  attempt in despair. Besides, the supply of pink and blue ribbons had  given out long before, after the first dozen or so were born. As for  the baby clothes made ready, they were of no use, for all the garments  were too big. In one of the long dresses, tied up like a bag, one might  possibly, with stuffing, have put the whole family of three hundred and  sixty-six brothers and sisters.    It was not likely such small fry of human beings could live long. So,  the good Bishop Guy, of Utrecht, when he heard that the beggar woman's  curse had come true, in so unexpected a manner, ordered that the babies  should be all baptized at once. The Count, who was strict in his ideas  of both custom and church law, insisted on it too.    So nothing would do but to carry the tiny infants to church. How to get  them there, was a question. The whole house had been rummaged to provide  things to carry the little folks in: but the supply of trays, and mince  pie dishes, and crocks, was exhausted at the three hundred and sixtieth  baby. So there was left only a Turk's Head, or round glazed earthen  dish, fluted and curved, which looked like the turban of a Turk. Hence  its name. Into this, the last batch of babies, or extra six girls, were  stowed. Curiously enough, number 366 was an inch taller than the others.  To thirty house maids was given a tray, for each was to carry twelve  mannikins, and one the last six, in the Turk's Head. Instead of rich  silk blankets a wooden tray, and no clothes on, must suffice.    In the Groote Kerk, or Great Church, the Bishop was waiting, with his  assistants, holding brass basins full of holy water, for the  christening. All the town, including the dogs, were out to see what was  going on. Many boys and girls climbed up on the roofs of the one-story  houses, or in the trees to get a better view of the curious  procession--the like of which had never been seen in The Hague before.  Neither has anything like it ever been seen since.    So the parade began. First went the Count, with his captains and the  trumpeters, blowing their trumpets. These were followed by the  men-servants, all dressed in their best Sunday clothes, who had the  crest and arms of their master, the Count, on their backs and breasts.  Then came on the company of thirty-one maids, each one carrying a tray,  on which were twelve mannikins, or minikins. Twenty of these trays were  round and made of wood, lined with velvet, smooth and soft; but ten were  of earthenware, oblong in shape, like a manger. In these, every year,  were baked the Christmas pies.    At first, all went on finely, for the outdoor air seemed to put the  babies asleep and there was no crying. But no sooner were they inside  the church, than about two hundred of the brats began wailing and  whimpering. Pretty soon, they set up such a squall that the Count felt  ashamed of his progeny and the Bishop looked very unhappy.    To make matters worse, one of the maids, although warned of the danger,  stumbled over the helmet of an old crusader, carved in stone, that rose  some six inches or so above the floor. In a moment, she fell and lay  sprawling, spilling out at least a dozen babies. \"Heilige Mayke\" (Holy  Mary!), she cried, as she rolled over. \"Have I killed them?\"    Happily the wee ones were thrown against the long-trained gown of an old  lady walking directly in front of her, so that they were unhurt. They  were easily picked up and laid on the tray again, and once more the line  started.    Happily the Bishop had been notified that he would not have to call out  the names of all the infants, that is, three hundred and sixty-six; for  this would have kept him at the solemn business all day long. It had  been arranged that, instead of any on the list of the chosen forty-six,  to be so named, all the boys should be called John, and all the girls  Elizabeth; or, in Dutch, Jan and Lisbet, or Lizbethje. Yet even to say  \"John\" one hundred and eighty times, and \"Lisbet\" one hundred and  eighty-six times, nearly tired the old gentleman to death, for he was  fat and slow.    So, after the first six trays full of wee folks had been sprinkled, one  at a time, the Bishop decided to \"asperse\" them, that is, shake, from a  mop or brush, the holy water, on a tray full of babies at one time. So  he called for the \"aspersorium.\" Then, clipping this in the basin of  holy water, he scattered the drops over the wee folk, until all, even  the six extra girl babies in the Turk's Head, were sprinkled. Probably,  because the Bishop thought a Turk was next door to a heathen, he dropped  more water than usual on these last six, until the young ones squealed  lustily with the cold. It was noted, on the contrary, that the little  folks in the mince pie dishes were gently handled, as if the good man  had visions of Christmas coming and the good things on the table.    Yet it was evident that such tiny people could not bear what healthy  babies of full size would think nothing of. Whether it was because of  the damp weather, or the cold air in the brick church, or too much  excitement, or because there were not three hundred and sixty-six  nurses, or milk bottles ready, it came to pass that every one of the wee  creatures died when the sun went down.    Just where they were buried is not told, but, for hundreds of years,  there was, in one of The Hague churches, a monument in honor of these  little folks, who lived but a day. It was graven with portraits in stone  of the Count and Countess and told of their children, as many as the  days of the year. Near by, were hung up the two basins, in which the  holy water, used by the Bishop, in sprinkling the babies, was held. The  year, month and day of the wonderful event were also engraved. Many and  many people from various lands came to visit the tomb. The guide books  spoke of it, and tender women wept, as they thought how three hundred  and sixty-six little cradles, in the Count's castle, would have looked,  had each baby lived.          THE ONI ON HIS TRAVELS      Across the ocean, in Japan, there once lived curious creatures called  Onis. Every Japanese boy and girl has heard of them, though one has not  often been caught. In one museum, visitors could see the hairy leg of a  specimen. Falling out of the air in a storm, the imp had lost his limb.  It had been torn off by being caught in the timber side of a well curb.  The story-teller was earnestly assured by one Japanese lad that his  grandfather had seen it tumble from the clouds.    Many people are sure that the Onis live in the clouds and occasionally  fall off, during a peal of thunder. Then they escape and hide down in a  well. Or, they get loose in the kitchen, rattle the dishes around, and  make a great racket. They behave like cats, with a dog after them. They  do a great deal of mischief, but not much harm. There are even some old  folks who say that, after all, Onis are only unruly children, that  behave like angels in the morning and act like imps in the afternoon. So  we see that not much is known about the Onis.    Many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7882"],[0,"The Life of Kit Carson: Hunter, Trapper, Guide, Indian Agent and Colonel U.S.A. (#13)"],[1,"Carson--Arrival of   the Reserves and End of the Battle.    When near the head waters of the Missouri, the trappers discovered they  were approaching the principal village of the Blackfeet. They determined  to attack and punish the Indians who had caused them so much trouble  and suffering; but the whites were so numerous and powerful that extreme  care was necessary to prevent their presence becoming known.    When a number of miles from the village, the trappers came to a halt,  and Kit Carson with several men was sent forward to reconnoitre. With  extreme caution they made their way to a point from which they could  overlook the village.    A glance showed the Indians hurriedly making ready to move elsewhere.  The shrewd red men had discovered their danger before their enemies  caught sight of them. Carson galloped back as rapidly as he could, and  made known what had been seen. A council was hastily called and about  half the company advanced to give the Blackfeet battle. Kit Carson, as  might be supposed, was made the leader. The others were to guard the  property, advance slowly and act as reserve, which could be hurried  forward should it become necessary.    As agreed upon, Kit Carson galloped ahead, and the moment his men came  in sight of the village, they dashed through it, killing a number  of warriors. The others slowly fell back, fighting as they went, and  without showing the least panic. They received charge after charge of  the white men, with the steadiness of veterans. By and by the eagerness  of the trappers reduced their ammunition and their firing became less  destructive. The Blackfeet were quick to perceive the cause, and in turn  they charged upon their assailants who became immediately involved in  a desperate hand to hand fight. It was then the small arms in the  possession of the whites played their part. They were used with such  effect, that the fierce warriors were compelled once more to retreat.    But the courageous red men recoiled a short distance only, when they  halted and then, with exultant yells, dashed toward the trappers, who  despite all they could do, were forced back until it looked as if the  whole party would be overwhelmed and destroyed.    On this retreat, one of the horses belonging to the hunters was shot,  and plunged to the ground so suddenly that his rider was caught before  he could spring from the saddle. Several of the warriors were quick to  perceive his sore straits, and dashed toward him, eager to secure his  scalp. The poor fellow struggled desperately, but could not extricate  himself, and his expression of horrified despair when he perceived the  fierce red men running a race with each other to reach him, would have  melted the heart of almost any one.    Carson was several rods distant, but seeing the danger of his friend,  he bounded out of his saddle, and shouted to the others to rally to the  defence of their imperilled comrade. Kit raised his rifle while on the  run and shot the leading warrior dead. The other whites were so close  behind that the remaining Blackfeet whirled and ran for their lives.  Several of them were shot down before they could reach the shelter of  the rocks from behind which they sprang after the fallen white man.    Carson's devotion to his friend now placed him in an unpleasant if not  dangerous situation. His steed being without restraint, galloped off  beyond his reach, and the commander was thus left on foot, when there  was urgent need that he should be mounted.    Meanwhile the mountaineer who was caught under the body of his horse,  was struggling desperately to withdraw his imprisoned leg, for there was  no saying when the Blackfeet would be upon him again. He succeeded at  last, and, standing upon his feet, shook himself together, as may be  said, and he found that though pretty badly bruised, no bones were  broken, and he was able to do his full part in the serious duty before  him.    The exciting episode benefited the trappers in one respect: it served to  check the seemingly resistless rush of the Blackfeet and gave the others  a chance to rally and fix upon some course of action.    Carson ran rapidly toward the nearest horseman and sprang upon the back  of his animal behind him. The steed was forced to his best and speedily  joined the main body a short distance off. It was fortunate that just at  that moment there came a lull in the furious fighting, else Carson could  scarcely have escaped so well. The runaway horse was pursued by one  of the mountaineers who finally cornered and brought him back to their  leader.    The Blackfeet did not follow the whites, nor did the latter return to  their charge against them. Both parties had gained a thorough taste of  each other's mettle, and the conclusion reached was like that of two  trained pugilists--their strength was so nearly equal that neither could  afford to throw away his advantage by leading in the assault.    Undoubtedly Carson and his men would have withdrawn but for the hope  that the reserves were close at hand. The trappers had fought valiantly  but not more so than the Indians, who still possessed plenty ammunition  while that of the whites was nearly exhausted. Had they advanced and  encountered the warriors again, the latter would have swept everything  before them. As it was, the mountaineers were by no means safe even when  acting on the defensive. If the red men should charge upon them with  their old time fierceness, it was by no means certain they would  not destroy the whites. The fight would necessarily be of the most  sanguinary nature, but when guns and small arms were useless for lack  of ammunition, nothing short of a miracle could save them from  annihilation.    Several hours had gone and Carson and his men wondered what could delay  the reserves. Time always passes slowly to those in waiting, and to some  of the hunters the tardiness of their friends was unaccountable. Carson  was on the point of sending messengers back to hurry them forward, when  the whole party appeared and the situation changed.    But those who expected the Blackfeet to flee in panic when they observed  the doubling of the assailing forces, were much mistaken. The feeling  among the Indians could not be described as in the least \"panicky.\"  They quietly surveyed the new arrivals and prepared with the coolness  of veterans for the conflict that was sure to come, within the next few  minutes.    The powder was distributed among the trappers, who were more eager than  ever to attack their old enemies, who were as ready as they for the  conflict. Nearly two hundred yards separated the combatants, when  the mountaineers, leaving their horses behind, advanced on foot. The  Blackfeet stationed themselves behind rocks and trees and defiantly  awaited the attack.    In a few minutes the most savage fight of the day was raging. A hundred  rifles were flashing in every direction and the yells of the red men  mingled with the shouts of the excited mountaineers.    As the warriors had used every means to shelter themselves, it was  necessary to dislodge them before they could be driven back. Without  remaining together in a compact mass, the trappers made for them with  the fierceness of tigers.    The result of this charge were a number of remarkable combats. A hunter  would dash at a warrior crouching behind some rock, and the two would  begin dodging, advancing, retreating, firing, striking and manoeuvering  against each other. Sometimes one would succeed and sometimes the other.  The Blackfoot, finding the situation becoming too hot, would break  for other cover and probably would be shot on the run or would escape  altogether. Again, it would be the white man who would be just a second  too late in discharging his gun and would pay the penalty with his life.    At last the Indians began falling back and the mountaineers pushing them  hard, they finally broke and fled in a wild panic, leaving many dead  behind them. On the part of the trappers three had been killed and quite  a number badly wounded.        CHAPTER XVI.

The fight between the Blackfeet and trappers was one of the most  important in which Kit Carson, previous to the late war, was ever  engaged. The forces must have included several hundred, and the lesson  administered to the aggressive red men was remembered by them a long  time.    After burying their dead, looking after the wounded and setting matters  to rights, the hunters resumed trapping through the Blackfoot country.  They were scarcely disturbed by their old enemies who dreaded rousing  the resentment of such a formidable body of daring and unerring  marksmen.    Our friends were very successful, and, when they made their way to the  rendezvous, a week's journey away, they carried with them an immense  stock of peltries. When the trading was finished, the parties made new  combinations and departed in different directions. Instead of attaching  himself to a large company, Kit Carson and seven choice spirits started  for a trading post known at that time as Brown's Hole. They reached  there just in time for the leader to join an expedition, numbering only  two beside himself, which went into the Navajoe country for purposes of  barter. The venture proved a great success and Carson drifted back again  to Brown's Hole. There such liberal offers were made him to serve  as hunter for the fort, that he accepted and entered upon his rather  singular, but exceedingly congenial duties.    These, as the reader must know, simply consisted of keeping the garrison  supplied with all the meat they needed. Though the country was noted for  its fine game, it required much time, skill and"]]]
