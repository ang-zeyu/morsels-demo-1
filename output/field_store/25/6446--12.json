It was a dark cellar underground, built with strong stone walls, into  which any criminal guilty of a capital offence was ushered to breathe  his last there without food and drink. Such was the cellar into which  Gangazara was thrust. What were his thoughts when he reached that  place? \"It is of no use to accuse either the goldsmith or the prince  now. We are all the children of fate. We must obey her commands. This  is but the first day of my father's prophecy. So far his statement is  true. But how am I going to pass ten years here? Perhaps without  anything to sustain life I may drag on my existence for a day or two.  But how pass ten years? That cannot be, and I must die. Before death  comes let me think of my faithful brute friends.\"    So pondered Gangazara in the dark cell underground, and at that moment  thought of his three friends. The tiger-king, serpent-king, and  rat-king assembled at once with their armies at a garden near the  dungeon, and for a while did not know what to do. They held their  council, and decided to make an underground passage from the inside  of a ruined well to the dungeon. The rat raja issued an order at once  to that effect to his army. They, with their teeth, bored the ground a  long way to the walls of the prison. After reaching it they found that  their teeth could not work on the hard stones. The bandicoots were  then specially ordered for the business; they, with their hard teeth,  made a small slit in the wall for a rat to pass and repass without  difficulty. Thus a passage was effected.    The rat raja entered first to condole with his protector on his  misfortune, and undertook to supply his protector with provisions.  \"Whatever sweetmeats or bread are prepared in any house, one and all  of you must try to bring whatever you can to our benefactor. Whatever  clothes you find hanging in a house, cut down, dip the pieces in  water, and bring the wet bits to our benefactor. He will squeeze them  and gather water for drink! and the bread and sweetmeats shall form  his food.\" Having issued these orders, the king of the rats took leave  of Gangazara. They, in obedience to their king's order, continued to  supply him with provisions and water.    The snake-king said: \"I sincerely condole with you in your calamity;  the tiger-king also fully sympathises with you, and wants me to tell  you so, as he cannot drag his huge body here as we have done with our  small ones. The king of the rats has promised to do his best to  provide you with food. We would now do what we can for your release.  From this day we shall issue orders to our armies to oppress all the  subjects of this kingdom. The deaths by snake-bite and tigers shall  increase a hundredfold from this day, and day by day it shall continue  to increase till your release. Whenever you hear people near you, you  had better bawl out so as to be heard by them: 'The wretched prince  imprisoned me on the false charge of having killed his father, while  it was a tiger that killed him. From that day these calamities have  broken out in his dominions. If I were released I would save all by my  powers of healing poisonous wounds and by incantations.' Some one may  report this to the king, and if he knows it, you will obtain your  liberty.\" Thus comforting his protector in trouble, he advised him to  pluck up courage, and took leave of him. From that day tigers and  serpents, acting under the orders of their kings, united in killing as  many persons and cattle as possible. Every day people were carried  away by tigers or bitten by serpents. Thus passed months and years.  Gangazara sat in the dark cellar, without the sun's light falling upon  him, and feasted upon the breadcrumbs and sweetmeats that the rats so  kindly supplied him with. These delicacies had completely changed his  body into a red, stout, huge, unwieldy mass of flesh. Thus passed full  ten years, as prophesied in the horoscope.    Ten complete years rolled away in close imprisonment. On the last  evening of the tenth year one of the serpents got into the bed-chamber  of the princess and sucked her life. She breathed her last. She was  the only daughter of the king. The king at once sent for all the  snake-bite curers. He promised half his kingdom and his daughter's  hand to him who would restore her to life. Now a servant of the king  who had several times overheard Gangazara's cries, reported the matter  to him. The king at once ordered the cell to be examined. There was  the man sitting in it. How had he managed to live so long in the cell?  Some whispered that he must be a divine being. Thus they discussed,  while they brought Gangazara to the king.    The king no sooner saw Gangazara than he fell on the ground. He was  struck by the majesty and grandeur of his person. His ten years'  imprisonment in the deep cell underground had given a sort of lustre  to his body. His hair had first to be cut before his face could be  seen. The king begged forgiveness for his former fault, and requested  him to revive his daughter.    \"Bring me within an hour all the corpses of men and cattle, dying and  dead, that remain unburnt or unburied within the range of your  dominions; I shall revive them all,\" were the only words that  Gangazara spoke.    Cartloads of corpses of men and cattle began to come in every minute.  Even graves, it is said, were broken open, and corpses buried a day or  two before were taken out and sent for their revival. As soon as all  were ready, Gangazara took a vessel full of water and sprinkled it  over them all, thinking only of his snake-king and tiger-king. All  rose up as if from deep slumber, and went to their respective homes.  The princess, too, was restored to life. The joy of the king knew no  bounds. He cursed the day on which he imprisoned him, blamed himself  for having believed the word of a goldsmith, and offered him the hand  of his daughter and the whole kingdom, instead of half, as he  promised. Gangazara would not accept anything, but asked the king to  assemble all his subjects in a wood near the town. \"I shall there call  in all the tigers and serpents, and give them a general order.\"    When the whole town was assembled, just at the dusk of evening,  Gangazara sat dumb for a moment, and thought upon the Tiger King and  the Serpent King, who came with all their armies. People began to take  to their heels at the sight of tigers. Gangazara assured them of  safety, and stopped them.    The grey light of the evening, the pumpkin colour of Gangazara, the  holy ashes scattered lavishly over his body, the tigers and snakes  humbling themselves at his feet, gave him the true majesty of the god  Gangazara. For who else by a single word could thus command vast  armies of tigers and serpents, said some among the people. \"Care not  for it; it may be by magic. That is not a great thing. That he revived  cartloads of corpses shows him to be surely Gangazara,\" said others.    \"Why should you, my children, thus trouble these poor subjects of  Ujjaini? Reply to me, and henceforth desist from your ravages.\" Thus  said the Soothsayer's son, and the following reply came from the king  of the tigers: \"Why should this base king imprison your honour,  believing the mere word of a goldsmith that your honour killed his  father? All the hunters told him that his father was carried away by a  tiger. I was the messenger of death sent to deal the blow on his neck.  I did it, and gave the crown to your honour. The prince makes no  inquiry, and at once imprisons your honour. How can we expect justice  from such a stupid king as that? Unless he adopt a better standard of  justice we will go on with our destruction.\"    The king heard, cursed the day on which he believed in the word of a  goldsmith, beat his head, tore his hair, wept and wailed for his  crime, asked a thousand pardons, and swore to rule in a just way from  that day. The serpent-king and tiger-king also promised to observe  their oath as long as justice prevailed, and took their leave. The  goldsmith fled for his life. He was caught by the soldiers of the  king, and was pardoned by the generous Gangazara, whose voice now  reigned supreme. All returned to their homes.    The king again pressed Gangazara to accept the hand of his daughter.  He agreed to do so, not then, but some time afterwards. He wished to  go and see his elder brother first, and then to return and marry the  princess. The king agreed; and Gangazara left the city that very day  on his way home.    It so happened that unwittingly he took a wrong road, and had to pass  near a sea-coast. His elder brother was also on his way up to Benares  by that very same route. They met and recognised each other, even at a  distance. They flew into each other's arms. Both remained still for a  time almost unconscious with joy. The pleasure of Gangazara was so  great that he died of joy.    The elder brother was a devout worshipper of Ganesa. That was a  Friday, a day very sacred to that god. The elder brother took the  corpse to the nearest Ganesa temple and called upon him. The god came,  and asked him what he wanted. \"My poor brother is dead and gone; and  this is his corpse. Kindly keep it in your charge till I finish  worshipping you. If I leave it anywhere else the devils may snatch it  away when I am absent worshipping you; after finishing the rites I  shall burn him.\" Thus said the elder brother, and, giving the corpse  to the god Ganesa, he went to prepare himself for that deity's  ceremonials. Ganesa made over the corpse to his Ganas, asking them to  watch over it carefully. But instead of that they devoured it.    The elder brother, after finishing the puja, demanded his brother's  corpse of the god. The god called his Ganas, who came to the front  blinking, and fearing the anger of their master. The god was greatly  enraged. The elder brother was very angry.

He was hardly  invested with the royal mantle before the Saracens menaced his capital.  With much vigour and judgment he exerted himself to follow up the  advantages he had gained, and marching out to meet the enemy before  they had time to besiege him in Jerusalem, he gave them battle at  Ascalon, and defeated them with great loss. He did not, however, live  long to enjoy his new dignity, being seized with a fatal illness when  he had only reigned nine months. To him succeeded his brother, Baldwin  of Edessa. The latter monarch did much to improve the condition of  Jerusalem and to extend its territory, but was not able to make a firm  footing for his successors. For fifty years, in which the history of  Jerusalem is full of interest to the historical student, the crusaders  were exposed to fierce and constant hostilities, often gaining battles  and territory, and as often losing them, but becoming every day weaker  and more divided, while the Saracens became stronger and more united to  harass and root them out.  The battles of this period were of the most  chivalrous character, and deeds of heroism were done by the handful of  brave knights that remained in Syria, which have hardly their parallel  in the annals of war. In the course of time, however, the Christians  could not avoid feeling some respect for the courage, and admiration  for the polished manners and advanced civilization of the Saracens, so  much superior to the rudeness and semi-barbarism of Europe at that day.  Difference of faith did not prevent them from forming alliances with  the dark-eyed maidens of the East. One of the first to set the example  of taking a Paynim spouse was King Baldwin himself, and these  connexions in time became, not only frequent, but almost universal,  among such of the knights as had resolved to spend their lives in  Palestine. These Eastern ladies were obliged, however, to submit to the  ceremony of baptism before they could be received to the arms of a  Christian lord.  These, and their offspring, naturally looked upon the  Saracens with less hatred than did the zealots who conquered Jerusalem,  and who thought it a sin deserving the wrath of God to spare an  unbeliever. We find, in consequence, that the most obstinate battles  waged during the reigns of the later Kings of Jerusalem were fought by  the new and raw levies who from time to time arrived from Europe, lured  by the hope of glory, or spurred by fanaticism. The latter broke  without scruple the truces established between the original settlers  and the Saracens, and drew down severe retaliation upon many thousands  of their brethren in the faith, whose prudence was stronger than their  zeal, and whose chief desire was to live in peace.    Things remained in this unsatisfactory state till the close of the year  1145, when Edessa, the strong frontier town of the Christian kingdom,  fell into the bauds of the Saracens. The latter were commanded by  Zenghi, a powerful and enterprising monarch, and, after his death, by  his son Nourheddin, as powerful and enterprising as his father. An  unsuccessful attempt was made by the Count of Edessa to regain the  fortress, but Nourheddin, with a large army, came to the rescue, and  after defeating the Count with great slaughter, marched into Edessa and  caused its fortifications to be rased to the ground, that the town  might never more be a bulwark of defence for the kingdom of Jerusalem.  The road to the capital was now open, and consternation seized the  hearts of the Christians. Nourheddin, it was known, was only waiting  for a favourable opportunity to advance upon Jerusalem, and the armies  of the Cross, weakened and divided, were not in a condition to make any  available resistance. The clergy were filled with grief and alarm, and  wrote repeated letters to the Pope and the sovereigns of Europe, urging  the expediency of a new Crusade for the relief of Jerusalem. By far the  greater number of the priests of Palestine were natives of France, and  these naturally looked first to their own country. The solicitations  they sent to Louis the Seventh were urgent and oft repeated, and the  chivalry of France began to talk once more of arming in the defence of  the birthplace of Jesus. The kings of Europe, whose interest it had not  been to take any part in the first Crusade, began to bestir themselves  in this; and a man appeared, eloquent as Peter the Hermit, to arouse  the people as he had done.    We find, however, that the enthusiasm of the second did not equal that  of the first Crusade: in fact, the mania had reached its climax in the  time of Peter the Hermit, and decreased regularly from that period. The  third Crusade was less general than the second, and the fourth than the  third, and so on, until the public enthusiasm was quite extinct, and  Jerusalem returned at last to the dominion of its old masters without a  convulsion in Christendom. Various reasons have been assigned for this;  and one very generally put forward is, that Europe was wearied with  continued struggles, and had become sick of \"precipitating itself upon  Asia.\" M. Guizot, in his admirable lectures upon European civilization,  successfully combats this opinion, and offers one of his own, which is  far more satisfactory. He says, in his eighth lecture, \"It has been  often repeated, that Europe was tired of continually invading Asia.  This expression appears to me exceedingly incorrect. It is not possible  that human beings can be wearied with what they have not done--that the  labours of their forefathers can fatigue them. Weariness is a personal,  not an inherited feeling. The men of the thirteenth century were not  fatigued by the Crusades of the twelfth. They were influenced by  another cause. A great change had taken place in ideas, sentiments, and  social conditions. The same desires and the same wants were no longer  felt. The same things were no longer believed. The people refused to  believe what their ancestors were persuaded of.\"    This is, in fact, the secret of the change; and its truth becomes more  apparent as we advance in the history of the Crusades, and compare the  state of the public mind at the different periods when Godfrey of  Bouillon, Louis VII. and Richard I. were chiefs and leaders of the  movement. The Crusades themselves were the means of operating a great  change in national ideas, and advancing the civilization of Europe. In  the time of Godfrey, the nobles were all-powerful and all-oppressive,  and equally obnoxious to kings and people. During their absence along  with that portion of the community the deepest sunk in ignorance and  superstition, both kings and people fortified themselves against the  renewal of aristocratic tyranny, and in proportion as they became free,  became civilized. It was during this period that in France, the grand  centre of the crusading madness, the communes began to acquire  strength, and the monarch to possess a tangible and not a merely  theoretic authority. Order and comfort began to take root, and, when  the second Crusade was preached, men were in consequence much less  willing to abandon their homes than they had been during the first.  Such pilgrims as had returned from the Holy Land came back with minds  more liberal and expanded than when they set out. They had come in  contact with a people more civilized than themselves; they had seen  something more of the world, and had lost some portion, however small,  of the prejudice and bigotry of ignorance. The institution of chivalry  had also exercised its humanizing influence, and coming bright and  fresh through the ordeal of the Crusades, had softened the character  and improved the hearts of the aristocratic order. The Trouveres and  Troubadours, singing of love and war in strains pleasing to every class  of society, helped to root out the gloomy superstitions which, at the  first Crusade, filled the minds of all those who were able to think.  Men became in consequence less exclusively under the mental thraldom of  the priesthood, and lost much of the credulity which formerly  distinguished them.    The Crusades appear never to have excited so much attention in England  as on the continent of Europe; not because the people were less  fanatical than their neighbours, but because they were occupied in  matters of graver interest. The English were suffering too severely  from the recent successful invasion of their soil, to have much  sympathy to bestow upon the distresses of people so far away as the  Christians of Palestine; and we find that they took no part in the  first Crusade, and very little in the second. Even then those who  engaged in it were chiefly Norman knights and their vassals, and not  the Saxon franklins and population, who no doubt thought, in their  sorrow, as many wise men have thought since, that charity should begin  at home.    Germany was productive of more zeal in the cause, and her raw,  uncivilized hordes continued to issue forth under the banners of the  Cross in numbers apparently undiminished, when the enthusiasm had long  been on the wane in other countries. They were sunk at that time in a  deeper slough of barbarism than the livelier nations around them, and  took, in consequence, a longer period to free themselves from their  prejudices. In fact, the second Crusade drew its chief supplies of men  from that quarter, where alone the expedition can be said to have  retained any portion of popularity.    Such was the state of the mind of Europe when Pope Eugenius, moved by  the reiterated entreaties of the Christians of Syria, commissioned St.  Bernard to preach a new crusade. St. Bernard was a man eminently  qualified for the mission. He was"]]]
