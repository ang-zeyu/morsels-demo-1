After admiring the reed-bunting's action, I turned to the dwarf bush  near my feet, and saw, perched on a twig in its centre, a solitary young  bird, fully fledged but not yet capable of sustained flight. He did not  recognise an enemy in me; on the contrary, when I approached my hand to  him, he opened his yellow mouth wide, in expectation of being fed,  although his throat was crammed with caterpillars, and the white  crescent-shaped larva I had seen in the parent's bill was still lying in  his mouth unswallowed. The wonder is that when a young bird had been  stuffed with food to such an extent just before sleeping time, he can  still find it in him to open his mouth and call for more.    * * *    How wonderful it is that this parental instinct, so beautiful in its  perfect simulation of the action of the bird that has lost the power of  flight, should be found in so large a number of species! But when we  find that it is not universal; that in two closely-allied species one  will possess it and the other not; and that it is common in such  widely-separated orders as gallinaceous and passerine birds, in pigeons,  ducks, and waders, it becomes plain that it is not assignable to  community of descent, but has originated independently all over the  globe, in a vast number of species. Something of the beginnings and  progressive development of this instinct may be learnt, I think, by  noticing the behaviour of various passerine birds in the presence of  danger, to their nests and young. Their actions and cries show that they  are greatly agitated, and in a majority of species the parent bird flits  and flutters round the intruder, uttering sounds of distress. Frequently  the bird exhibits its agitation, not only by these cries and restless  motions, but by the drooping of the wings and tail--the action observed  in a bird when hurt or sick, or oppressed with heat. These languishing  signs are common to a great many species after the young have been  hatched; the period when the parental solicitude is most intense. In  several species which I have observed in South America, the languishing  is more marked. There are no sorrowful cries and restless movements; the  bird sits with hanging wings and tail, gasping for breath with open bill  --in appearance a greatly suffering bird. In some cases of this  description, the bird, if it moves at all, hops or flutters from a  higher to a lower branch, and, as if sick or wounded, seems about to  sink to the ground. In still others, the bird actually does drop to the  ground, then, feebly flapping its wings, rises again with great effort.  From this last form it is but a step to the more highly developed  complex instinct of the bird that sinks to the earth and flutters  painfully away, gasping, and seemingly incapable of flight.    It would be a great mistake to suppose that the bird when fluttering on  the ground to lead an enemy from the neighbourhood of its nest is in  full possession of all its faculties, acting consciously, and itself in  as little danger of capture as when on its perch or flying through the  air. We have seen that the action has its root in the bird's passion for  its young, and intense solicitude in the presence of any danger  threatening them, which is so universal in this class of creatures, and  which expresses itself so variously in different kinds. This must be in  all cases a painful and debilitating emotion, and when the bird drops  down to the earth its pain has caused it to fall as surely as if it had  received a wound or had been suddenly attacked by some grievous malady;  and when it flutters on the ground it is for the moment incapable of  flight, and its efforts to recover flight and safety cause it to beat  its wings, and tremble, and gasp with open mouth. The object of the  action is to deceive an enemy, or, to speak more correctly, the result  is to deceive, and there is nothing that will more inflame and carry  away any rapacious mammal than the sight of a fluttering bird. But in  thus drawing upon itself the attention of an enemy threatening the  safety of its eggs or young, to what a terrible danger does the parent  expose itself, and how often, in those moments of agitation and  debility, must its own life fall a sacrifice! The sudden spring and rush  of a feline enemy must have proved fatal in myriads of instances. From  its inception to its most perfect stage, in the various species that  possess it, this perilous instinct has been washed in blood and made  bright.    What I have just said, that the peculiar instinct and deceptive action  we have been considering is made and kept bright by being bathed in  blood, applies to all instinctive acts that tend to the preservation of  life, both of the individual and species. Necessarily so, seeing that,  for one thing, instincts can only arise and grow to perfection in order  to meet cases which commonly occur in the life of a species. The  instinct is not prophetic and does not meet rare or extraordinary  situations. Unless intelligence or some higher faculty comes in to  supplement or to take the place of instinctive action then the creature  must perish on account of the limitation of instinct. Again, the higher  and more complete the instinct the more perilous it is, seeing that its  efficiency depends on the absolutely perfect health and balance of all  the faculties and the entire organism. Thus, the higher instinctive  faculty and action of birds for the preservation of the species, that of  migration, is undoubtedly the most dangerous of all. It is so perfect  that by means of this faculty millions and myriads of birds of an  immense variety of species from cranes, swans, and geese down to minute  goldcrests and firecrests and the smallest feeble-winged-leaf warblers,  are able to inhabit and to distribute themselves evenly over all the  temperate and cold regions of the earth, and even nearer the pole: and  in all these regions they rear their young and spend several months each  year, where they would inevitably perish from cold and lack of food if  they stayed on to meet the winter. We can best realize the perfection of  this instinct when we consider that all these migrants, including the  young which have never hitherto strayed beyond the small area of their  home where every tree and bush and spring and rock is familiar to them,  rush suddenly away as if blown by a wind to unknown lands and continents  beyond the seas to a distance of from a thousand to six or seven  thousand miles; that after long months spent in those distant places,  which in turn have grown familiar to them, they return again to their  natal place, not in a direct but ofttimes by a devious route, now north,  now north-east, now east or west, keeping to the least perilous lines  and crossing the seas where they are narrowest. Thus, when the returning  multitude recrosses the Channel into England, coming by way of France  and Spain from north or south or mid-Africa and from Asia, they at once  proceed to disperse over the entire country from Land's End to Thurso  and the northernmost islands of Scotland, until every wood and hill and  moor and thicket and stream and every village and field and hedgerow and  farmhouse has its own feathered people back in their old places. But  they do not return in their old force. They had increased to twice or  three times their original numbers when they left us, and as a result of  that great adventure a half or two-thirds of the vast army has perished.    The instinct which in character comes nearest to that of the parent  simulating the action of a wounded and terrified bird struggling to  escape in order to safeguard its young, is that one, very strong in all  ground-breeding species, of sitting close on the nest in the presence of  danger. Here, too, the instinct is of prime importance to the species,  since the bird by quitting the nest reveals its existence to the  prowling, nest-seeking enemy--dog, cat, fox, stoat, rat, in England;  and in the country where I first observed animals, the skunk, armadillo,  opossum, snake, wild cat, and animals of the weasel family. By leaving  its nest a minute or half a minute too soon the bird sacrifices the eggs  or young; by staying a moment too long it is in imminent danger of being  destroyed itself.  How often the bird stays too long on the nest is seen  in the corn-crake, a species continually decreasing in this country  owing to the destruction caused by the mowing-machine. The parent birds  that escape may breed again in a safer place, but in many cases the bird  clings too long to its nest and is decapitated or fatally injured by the  cutters.  Larks, too, often perish in the same way. To go back to the  ailing or wounded bird simulating action: this is perhaps most perfect  in the gallinaceous birds, all ground-breeders whose nests are most  diligently hunted for by all egg-eating creatures, beast or bird, and  whose tender chicks are a favourite food for all rapacious animals. In  the fowl, pheasants, partridges, quail, and grouse, the instinct is  singularly powerful, the bird making such violent efforts to escape,  with such an outcry, such beating of its wings and struggles on the  ground, that no rapacious beast, however often he may have been deceived  before, can fail to be carried away with the prospect of an immediate  capture. The instinct and action has appeared to me more highly  developed in these birds because, in the first place, the demonstrations  are more violent than in other families, consequently more effective;  and secondly, because the danger once over, the bird's recovery to its  normal quiet, watchful state is quicker. By way of experiment, I have at  various times thrown myself on pheasants, partridges and grouse, when I  have found them with a family"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#13)"],[1," to within fifty yards they stood still,  staring and snorting as if alarmed or astonished, after which they swept  round me three or four times, neighing in a sharp, ringing manner, and  finally, after having exhausted their superfluous energy, they walked to  the plow and placed themselves deliberately before it. It looked as if  these animals had come at my call to do the work; I therefore approached  them, with more than needful caution, using many soothing, conciliatory  sounds and words the while, and after a little further study I  discovered how to adjust the ropes to them. There were no blinkers or  reins, nor did these superb animals seem to think any were wanted; but  after I had taken the pole in my hand, and said \"Gee up, Dobbin,\" in a  tone of command, followed by some inarticulate clicks with the tongue,  they rewarded me with a disconcerting stare, and then began dragging the  plow. As long as I held the pole straight the share cut its way evenly  through the mold, but occasionally, owing to my inadvertence, it would  go off at a tangent or curve quite out of the ground; and whenever this  happened the horses would stop, turn round and stare at me, then,  touching their noses together seem to exchange ideas on the subject.  When the first furrow was finished, they did not double back, as I  expected, but went straight away to a distance of thirty yards, and  then, turning, marched back, cutting a fresh furrow parallel with the  first, and as straight as a line. Then they returned to the original  starting-point and cut another, then again to the new furrow, and so on  progressively. All this seemed very wonderful to me, giving the  impression that I had been a skillful plowman all my life without  knowing it. It was interesting work; and I was also amused to see the  little birds that came in numbers from the wood to devour the worms in  the fresh-turned mold; for between their fear of me and their desire to  get the worms, they were in a highly perplexed state, and generally  confined their operations to one end of the furrow while I was away at  the other. The space the horses had marked out for themselves was plowed  up in due time, whereupon they marched off and made a fresh furrow as  before, where there was nothing to guide them; and so the work went on  agreeably for some hours, until I felt myself growing desperately  hungry. Sitting down on the beam of the plow, I opened my basket and  discussed the homely fare with a keen appetite.    After finishing the food I resumed work again, but not as cheerfully as  at first: I began to feel a little stiff and tired, and the immense  quantity of mold adhering to my boots made it heavy walking; moreover,  the novelty had now worn off. The horses also did not work as smoothly  as at the commencement: they seemed to have something on their minds,  for at the end of every furrow they would turn and stare at me in the  most exasperating manner.    \"Phew!\" I ejaculated, as I stood wiping the honest sweat from my face  with my moldy, ancient, and extremely dirty pocket-handkerchief. \"Three  hundred and sixty-four days of this sort of thing is a rather long price  to pay for a suit of clothes.\"    While standing there, I saw an animal coming swiftly towards me from the  direction of the forest, bounding along over the earth with a speed like  that of a greyhound--a huge, fierce-looking brute; and when close to me,  I felt convinced that it was an animal of the same kind as the one I had  seen during the night. Before I had made up my mind what to do, he was  within a few yards of me, and then, coming to a sudden halt, he sat down  on his haunches, and gravely watched me. Calling to mind some things I  had heard about the terrifying effect of the human eye on royal tigers  and other savage beasts, I gazed steadily at him, and then almost lost  my fear in admiration of his beauty. He was taller than a boarhound, but  slender in figure, with keen, fox-like features, and very large, erect  ears; his coat was silvery-gray, and long; there were two black spots  above his eyes; and the feet, muzzle, ear-tips, and end of the bushy  tail were also velvet-black. After watching me quietly for two or three  minutes, he started up, and, much to my relief, trotted away towards the  wood; but after going about fifty yards he looked back, and seeing me  still gazing after him, wheeled round and rushed at me, and when quite  close uttered a sound like a ringing, metallic yelp, after which he once  more bounded away, and disappeared from sight.    The horses now turned round, and, deliberately walking up to me, stood  still, in spite of all I could do to make them continue the work. After  waiting a while they proceeded to wriggle themselves out of the ropes,  and galloped off, loudly neighing to each other, and flinging up their  disdainful heels so as to send a shower of dirt over me. Left alone in  this unceremonious fashion, I presently began to think that they knew  more about the work than I did, and that, finding me indisposed to  release them at the proper moment, they had taken the matter into their  own hands, or hoofs rather. A little more pondering, and I also came to  the conclusion that the singular wolf-like animal was only one of the  house-dogs; that he had visited me in the night to remind me that I was  sleeping with the door open, and had come now to insist on a suspension  of work.    Glad at having discovered all these things without displaying my  ignorance by asking questions, I took up my basket and started home.              Chapter 9    When I arrived at the house I was met by the young man who had set me  the morning's task; but he was taciturn now, and wore a cold, estranged  look, which seemed to portend trouble. He at once led me to a part of  the house at a distance from the hall, and into a large apartment I now  saw for the first time. In a few moments the master of the house,  followed by most of the other inmates, also entered, and on the faces of  all of them I noticed the same cold, offended look.    \"The dickens take my luck!\" said I to myself, beginning to feel  extremely uncomfortable. \"I suppose I have offended against the laws and  customs by working the horses too long.\"    \"Smith,\" said the old man, advancing to the table, and depositing  thereon a large volume he had brought with him, \"come here, and read to  me in this book.\"    Advancing to the table, I saw that it was written in the same minute,  Hebrew-like characters of the folio I had examined on the previous  evening. \"I cannot read it; I do not understand the letters,\" I said,  feeling some shame at having thus publicly to confess my ignorance.    \"Then,\" said he, bending on me a look of the utmost severity, \"there is  indeed little more to be said. Nevertheless, we take into account the  confused state of your intellect yesterday, and judge you leniently; and  let us hope that the pangs of an outraged conscience will be more  painful to you than the light punishment I am about to inflict for so  destestable a crime.\"    I now concluded that I had offended by squeezing Yoletta's hand, and had  been told to read from the book merely to make myself acquainted with  the pains and penalties attendant on such an indiscretion, for to call  it a \"detestable crime\" seemed to me a very great abuse of language.    \"If I have offended,\" was my answer, delivered with little humility, \"I  can only plead my ignorance of the customs of the house.\"    \"No man,\" he returned, with increased severity, \"is so ignorant as not  to know right from wrong. Had the matter come to my knowledge sooner, I  should have said: Depart from us, for your continued presence in the  house offends us; but we have made a compact with you, and, until the  year expires, we must suffer you. For the space of sixty days you must  dwell apart from us, never leaving the room, where each day a task will  be assigned to you, and subsisting on bread and water only. Let us hope  that in this period of solitude and silence you will sufficiently repent  your crime, and rejoin us afterwards with a changed heart; for all  offenses may be forgiven a man, but it is impossible to forgive a lie.\"    \"A lie!\" I exclaimed in amazement. \"I have told no lie!\"    \"This,\" said he, with an access of wrath, \"is an aggravation of your  former offense. It is even a worse offense than the first, and must be  dealt with separately--when the sixty days have expired.\"    \"Are you, then, going to condemn me without hearing me speak, or telling  me anything about it? What lie have I told?\"    After a pause, during which he closely scrutinized my face, he said,  pointing to the open page before him: \"Yesterday, in answer to my  question, you told me that you could read. Last evening you made a  contrary statement to Yoletta; and now here is the book, and you confess  that you cannot read it.\"    \"But that is easily explained,\" said I, immensely relieved, for I  certainly had felt a little guilty about the hand-squeezing performance,  although it was not a very serious matter. \"I can read the books of my  own country, and naturally concluded that your books were written in the  same kind of letters; but last evening I discovered that it was not so.  You have already seen the letters of my country on the coins I showed  you last evening.\"    And here I again pulled out my pocket-book, and emptied the contents on  the table.    He began to pick up the sovereigns one by one to examine them.  Meanwhile, finding my beautiful black and gold stylograph pen inserted  in the book, I thought I could not do better than to show him how I  wrote. Fortunately, the fluid in it had not become dry. Tearing a blank  page from my book I hastily scribbled a few lines, and handed the paper  to him, saying: \"This is how I write.\"    He began studying the paper, but his eyes, I perceived, wandered often  to the stylograph pen in my hand.    Presently he remarked:"]]]
