If he does not determine this point at once, he will find it  from the impulsiveness with which he pursues a prompt and definite end.  A pure, moral motive has for its end the absolute; time does not exist  for it, and the future becomes the present to it directly; by a necessary  development, it has to issue from the present. To a reason having no  limits the direction towards an end becomes confounded with the  accomplishment of this end, and to enter on a course is to have finished  it.    If, then, a young friend of the true and of the beautiful were to ask me  how, notwithstanding the resistance of the times, he can satisfy the  noble longing of his heart, I should reply: Direct the world on which you  act towards that which is good, and the measured and peaceful course of  time will bring about the results. You have given it this direction if  by your teaching you raise its thoughts towards the necessary and the  eternal; if, by your acts or your creations, you make the necessary and  the eternal the object of your leanings. The structure of error and of  all that is arbitrary must fall, and it has already fallen, as soon as  you are sure that it is tottering. But it is important that it should  not only totter in the external but also in the internal man. Cherish  triumphant truth in the modest sanctuary of your heart; give it an  incarnate form through beauty, that it may not only be in the  understanding that does homage to it, but that feeling may lovingly grasp  its appearance. And that you may not by any chance take from external  reality the model which you yourself ought to furnish, do not venture  into its dangerous society before you are assured in your own heart that  you have a good escort furnished by ideal nature. Live with your age,  but be not its creation; labor for your contemporaries, but do for them  what they need, and not what they praise. Without having shared their  faults, share their punishment with a noble resignation, and bend under  the yoke which they find it as painful to dispense with as to bear. By  the constancy with which you will despise their good fortune, you will  prove to them that it is not through cowardice that you submit to their  sufferings. See them in thought such as they ought to be when you must  act upon them; but see them as they are when you are tempted to act for  them. Seek to owe their suffrage to their dignity; but to make them  happy keep an account of their unworthiness: thus, on the one hand, the  nobleness of your heart will kindle theirs, and, on the other, your end  will not be reduced to nothingness by their unworthiness. The gravity of  your principles will keep them off from you, but in play they will still  endure them. Their taste is purer than their heart, and it is by their  taste you must lay hold of this suspicious fugitive. In vain will you  combat their maxims, in vain will you condemn their actions; but you can  try your moulding hand on their leisure. Drive away caprice, frivolity,  and coarseness from their pleasures, and you will banish them  imperceptibly from their acts, and at length from their feelings.  Everywhere that you meet them, surround them with great, noble, and  ingenious forms; multiply around them the symbols of perfection, till  appearance triumphs over reality, and art over nature.          LETTER X.      Convinced by my preceding letters, you agree with me on this point, that  man can depart from his destination by two opposite roads, that our epoch  is actually moving on these two false roads, and that it has become the  prey, in one case, of coarseness, and elsewhere of exhaustion and  depravity. It is the beautiful that must bring it back from this twofold  departure. But how can the cultivation of the fine arts remedy, at the  same time, these opposite defects, and unite in itself two contradictory  qualities? Can it bind nature in the savage, and set it free in the  barbarian? Can it at once tighten a spring and loose it; and if it  cannot produce this double effect, how will it be reasonable to expect  from it so important a result as the education of man?    It may be urged that it is almost a proverbial adage that the feeling  developed by the beautiful refines manners, and any new proof offered on  the subject would appear superfluous. Men base this maxim on daily  experience, which shows us almost always clearness of intellect, delicacy  of feeling, liberality and even dignity of conduct, associated with a  cultivated taste, while an uncultivated taste is almost always  accompanied by the opposite qualities. With considerable assurance, the  most civilized nation of antiquity is cited as an evidence of this, the  Greeks, among whom the perception of the beautiful attained its highest  development, and, as a contrast, it is usual to point to nations in a  partial savage state, and partly barbarous, who expiate their  insensibility to the beautiful by a coarse, or, at all events, a hard,  austere character. Nevertheless, some thinkers are tempted occasionally  to deny either the fact itself or to dispute the legitimacy of the  consequences that are derived from it. They do not entertain so  unfavorable an opinion of that savage coarseness which is made a reproach  in the case of certain nations; nor do they form so advantageous an  opinion of the refinement so highly lauded in the case of cultivated  nations. Even as far back as in antiquity there were men who by no means  regarded the culture of the liberal arts as a benefit, and who were  consequently led to forbid the entrance of their republic to imagination.    I do not speak of those who calumniate art because they have never been  favored by it. These persons only appreciate a possession by the trouble  it takes to acquire it, and by the profit it brings: and how could they  properly appreciate the silent labor of taste in the exterior and  interior man? How evident it is that the accidental disadvantages  attending liberal culture would make them lose sight of its essential  advantages? The man deficient in form despises the grace of diction as a  means of corruption, courtesy in the social relations as dissimulation,  delicacy and generosity in conduct as an affected exaggeration. He  cannot forgive the favorite of the Graces for having enlivened all  assemblies as a man of the world, of having directed all men to his views  like a statesman, and of giving his impress to the whole century as a  writer: while he, the victim of labor, can only obtain with all his  learning, the least attention or overcome the least difficulty. As he  cannot learn from his fortunate rival the secret of pleasing, the only  course open to him is to deplore the corruption of human nature, which  adores rather the appearance than the reality.    But there are also opinions deserving respect, that pronounce themselves  adverse to the effects of the beautiful, and find formidable arms in  experience, with which to wage war against it. \"We are free to admit\"--  such is their language--\"that the charms of the beautiful can further  honorable ends in pure hands; but it is not repugnant to its nature to  produce, in impure hands, a directly contrary effect, and to employ in  the service of injustice and error the power that throws the soul of man  into chains. It is exactly because taste only attends to the form and  never to the substance; it ends by placing the soul on the dangerous  incline, leading it to neglect all reality and to sacrifice truth and  morality to an attractive envelope. All the real difference of things  vanishes, and it is only the appearance that determines the value! How  many men of talent\"--thus these arguers proceed--\"have been turned aside  from all effort by the seductive power of the beautiful, or have been led  away from all serious exercise of their activity, or have been induced to  use it very feebly? How many weak minds have been impelled to quarrel  with the organizations of society, simply because it has pleased the  imagination of poets to present the image of a world constituted  differently, where no propriety chains down opinion and no artifice holds  nature in thraldom? What a dangerous logic of the passions they have  learned since the poets have painted them in their pictures in the most  brilliant colors, and since, in the contest with law and duty, they have  commonly remained masters of the battle-field. What has society gained  by the relations of society, formerly under the sway of truth, being now  subject to the laws of the beautiful, or by the external impression  deciding the estimation in which merit is to be held? We admit that all  virtues whose appearance produces an agreeable effect are now seen to  flourish, and those which, in society, give a value to the man who  possesses them. But, as a compensation, all kinds of excesses are seen  to prevail, and all vices are in vogue that can be reconciled with a  graceful exterior.\" It is certainly a matter entitled to reflection  that, at almost all the periods of history when art flourished and taste  held sway, humanity is found in a state of decline; nor can a single  instance be cited of the union of a large diffusion of aesthetic culture  with political liberty and social virtue, of fine manners associated with  good morals, and of politeness fraternizing with truth and loyalty of  character and life.    As long as Athens and Sparta preserved their independence, and as long as  their institutions were based on respect for the laws, taste did not  reach its maturity, art remained in its infancy, and beauty was far from  exercising her empire over minds. No doubt, poetry had already taken a  sublime flight, but it was on the wings of genius, and we know that  genius borders very closely on savage coarseness, that it is a light  which shines readily in the midst of darkness, and which therefore often  argues against rather than in favor of the taste of time."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68"],[0,"Warlord of Mars (#13)"],[1,"ent, my  flier being wrecked upon the southern fringe of your great forest.  It was while seeking entrance to the city of Kaol that I discovered  the green horde lying in wait for your troops.\"    If Kulan Tith wondered what business brought me in a flier to the  very edge of his domain he was good enough not to press me further  for an explanation, which I should indeed have had difficulty in  rendering.    During my audience with the jeddak another party entered the  chamber from behind me, so that I did not see their faces until  Kulan Tith stepped past me to greet them, commanding me to follow  and be presented.    As I turned toward them it was with difficulty that I controlled  my features, for there, listening to Kulan Tith's eulogistic words  concerning me, stood my arch-enemies, Matai Shang and Thurid.    \"Holy Hekkador of the Holy Therns,\" the jeddak was saying, \"shower  thy blessings upon Dotar Sojat, the valorous stranger from distant  Hastor, whose wondrous heroism and marvelous ferocity saved the  day for Kaol yesterday.\"    Matai Shang stepped forward and laid his hand upon my shoulder.  No slightest indication that he recognized me showed upon his  countenance--my disguise was evidently complete.    He spoke kindly to me and then presented me to Thurid.  The black,  too, was evidently entirely deceived.  Then Kulan Tith regaled  them, much to my amusement, with details of my achievements upon  the field of battle.    The thing that seemed to have impressed him most was my remarkable  agility, and time and again he described the wondrous way in which  I had leaped completely over an antagonist, cleaving his skull wide  open with my long-sword as I passed above him.    I thought that I saw Thurid's eyes widen a bit during the narrative,  and several times I surprised him gazing intently into my face  through narrowed lids.  Was he commencing to suspect?  And then  Kulan Tith told of the savage calot that fought beside me, and  after that I saw suspicion in the eyes of Matai Shang--or did I  but imagine it?    At the close of the audience Kulan Tith announced that he would  have me accompany him upon the way to meet his royal guest, and  as I departed with an officer who was to procure proper trappings  and a suitable mount for me, both Matai Shang and Thurid seemed most  sincere in professing their pleasure at having had an opportunity  to know me.  It was with a sigh of relief that I quitted the chamber,  convinced that nothing more than a guilty conscience had prompted  my belief that either of my enemies suspected my true identity.    A half-hour later I rode out of the city gate with the column that  accompanied Kulan Tith upon the way to meet his friend and ally.  Though my eyes and ears had been wide open during my audience with  the jeddak and my various passages through the palace, I had seen  or heard nothing of Dejah Thoris or Thuvia of Ptarth.  That they  must be somewhere within the great rambling edifice I was positive,  and I should have given much to have found a way to remain behind  during Kulan Tith's absence, that I might search for them.    Toward noon we came in touch with the head of the column we had  set out to meet.    It was a gorgeous train that accompanied the visiting jeddak, and  for miles it stretched along the wide, white road to Kaol.  Mounted  troops, their trappings of jewel and metal-incrusted leather  glistening in the sunlight, formed the vanguard of the body, and  then came a thousand gorgeous chariots drawn by huge zitidars.    These low, commodious wagons moved two abreast, and on either side  of them marched solid ranks of mounted warriors, for in the chariots  were the women and children of the royal court.  Upon the back  of each monster zitidar rode a Martian youth, and the whole scene  carried me back to my first days upon Barsoom, now twenty-two years  in the past, when I had first beheld the gorgeous spectacle of a  caravan of the green horde of Tharks.    Never before today had I seen zitidars in the service of red men.  These brutes are huge mastodonian animals that tower to an immense  height even beside the giant green men and their giant thoats;  but when compared to the relatively small red man and his breed  of thoats they assume Brobdingnagian proportions that are truly  appalling.    The beasts were hung with jeweled trappings and saddlepads of gay  silk, embroidered in fanciful designs with strings of diamonds,  pearls, rubies, emeralds, and the countless unnamed jewels of Mars,  while from each chariot rose a dozen standards from which streamers,  flags, and pennons fluttered in the breeze.    Just in front of the chariots the visiting jeddak rode alone upon  a pure white thoat--another unusual sight upon Barsoom--and after  them came interminable ranks of mounted spearmen, riflemen, and  swordsmen.  It was indeed a most imposing sight.    Except for the clanking of accouterments and the occasional squeal  of an angry thoat or the low guttural of a zitidar, the passage of  the cavalcade was almost noiseless, for neither thoat nor zitidar  is a hoofed animal, and the broad tires of the chariots are of an  elastic composition, which gives forth no sound.    Now and then the gay laughter of a woman or the chatter of children  could be heard, for the red Martians are a social, pleasure-loving  people--in direct antithesis to the cold and morbid race of green  men.    The forms and ceremonials connected with the meeting of the two  jeddaks consumed an hour, and then we turned and retraced our way  toward the city of Kaol, which the head of the column reached just  before dark, though it must have been nearly morning before the  rear guard passed through the gateway.    Fortunately, I was well up toward the head of the column, and after  the great banquet, which I attended with the officers of the royal  guard, I was free to seek repose.  There was so much activity and  bustle about the palace all during the night with the constant  arrival of the noble officers of the visiting jeddak's retinue  that I dared not attempt to prosecute a search for Dejah Thoris,  and so, as soon as it was seemly for me to do so, I returned to my  quarters.    As I passed along the corridors between the banquet hall and the  apartments that had been allotted me, I had a sudden feeling that  I was under surveillance, and, turning quickly in my tracks, caught  a glimpse of a figure which darted into an open doorway the instant  I wheeled about.    Though I ran quickly back to the spot where the shadower had  disappeared I could find no trace of him, yet in the brief glimpse  that I had caught I could have sworn that I had seen a white face  surmounted by a mass of yellow hair.    The incident gave me considerable food for speculation, since if I  were right in the conclusion induced by the cursory glimpse I had  had of the spy, then Matai Shang and Thurid must suspect my identity,  and if that were true not even the service I had rendered Kulan  Tith could save me from his religious fanaticism.    But never did vague conjecture or fruitless fears for the future  lie with sufficient weight upon my mind to keep me from my rest,  and so tonight I threw myself upon my sleeping silks and furs and  passed at once into dreamless slumber.    Calots are not permitted within the walls of the palace proper,  and so I had had to relegate poor Woola to quarters in the stables  where the royal thoats are kept.  He had comfortable, even luxurious  apartments, but I would have given much to have had him with me;  and if he had been, the thing which happened that night would not  have come to pass.    I could not have slept over a quarter of an hour when I was suddenly  awakened by the passing of some cold and clammy thing across my  forehead.  Instantly I sprang to my feet, clutching in the direction I  thought the presence lay.  For an instant my hand touched against  human flesh, and then, as I lunged headforemost through the  darkness to seize my nocturnal visitor, my foot became entangled  in my sleeping silks and I fell sprawling to the floor.    By the time I had resumed my feet and found the button which  controlled the light my caller had disappeared.  Careful search of  the room revealed nothing to explain either the identity or business  of the person who had thus secretly sought me in the dead of night.    That the purpose might be theft I could not believe, since thieves  are practically unknown upon Barsoom.  Assassination, however, is  rampant, but even this could not have been the motive of my stealthy  friend, for he might easily have killed me had he desired.    I had about given up fruitless conjecture and was on the point  of returning to sleep when a dozen Kaolian guardsmen entered my  apartment.  The officer in charge was one of my genial hosts of  the morning, but now upon his face was no sign of friendship.    \"Kulan Tith commands your presence before him,\" he said.  \"Come!\"          NEW ALLIES      Surrounded by guardsmen I marched back along the corridors of the  palace of Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol, to the great audience chamber  in the center of the massive structure.    As I entered the brilliantly lighted apartment, filled with the  nobles of Kaol and the officers of the visiting jeddak, all eyes  were turned upon me.  Upon the great dais at the end of the chamber  stood three thrones, upon which sat Kulan Tith and his two guests,  Matai Shang, and the visiting jeddak.    Up the broad center aisle we marched beneath deadly silence, and  at the foot of the thrones we halted.    \"Prefer thy charge,\" said Kulan Tith, turning to one who stood  among the nobles at his right; and then Thurid, the black dator of  the First Born, stepped forward and faced me.    \"Most noble Jeddak,\" he said, addressing Kulan Tith, \"from the first  I suspected this stranger within thy palace.  Your description of  his fiendish prowess tallied with that of the arch-enemy of"]]]
