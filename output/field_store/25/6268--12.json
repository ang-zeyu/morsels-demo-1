By  day and night their positions are pounded with high explosives and  soaked in asphyxiating gas.    I went within 2,000 yards of it yesterday, and saw the heaviest work of  the British upon it. It was a wonderful May day, as today is, and the  sun shone through a golden haze upon the town. As I looked into Albert  and saw the shells smashing through, and then away up the Albert-Bapaume  road, past the white rim of the great mine crater of La Boiselle to the  treeless slopes of Posieres, and over all that ground of hills and  ditches to the high, wooded distant right, with its few dead stumps of  trees, it was hard to believe that all this was in the area of the  German Army, that the white, winding lines freshly marked upon this  bleak landscape were new German trenches, and that the enemy's outposts  were less than 2,000 yards from where I stood.      Fritz Having a \"Thin Time\"    Some siege gunners were lying on their stomachs and observing the  enemy's lines for some monsters I had seen on my way up, monsters that  raised their snouts slowly, like elephants' trunks, before bellowing out  with an earthquake roar, annihilating all one's senses for a second.  Some of the men passed the remark to me that \"Albert isn't the town it  was\" and that \"Fritz must be having a thin time there.\" They also  expressed the opinion that the Albert-Bapaume road was not a pleasant  walk for Germans on a sunny afternoon.    I did not dispute these points with them, for they were beyond argument.  Big shells were smashing into Albert and its neighborhood from many  heavy batteries, raising volcanic explosions there, and shrapnel was  bursting over the tracks in white splashes.    _In describing the artillery fire which broke up a threatened assault on  May 5, Mr. Gibbs wrote:_    A new German division, the 52d Reserve, and the 56th German Division  prepared an assault on Ridge Wood. All these men were crowded into  narrow assembly grounds and did not have quiet hours before the moment  of attack. They had hours of carnage in the darkness. British and French  guns were answering back the German bombardment with their heaviest  fire. French howitzers, long-muzzled fellows, which during recent weeks  I had seen crawling through Flanders with the cornflowers, as the French  soldiers call themselves, crowded about them on the gun limbers and  transport wagons and muddy horses, and which had traveled long  kilometers, were now in action from their emplacements between the  ruined villages of the Flemish war zone, and with their little  brothers, the soixante-quinzes, their blood-thirsty little brothers,  were savage in their destruction and harassing fire.    I have seen the soixante-quinze at work and have heard the rafale des  tambours de la mort--the ruffle of the drums of death--as the sound of  their fire is described by all soldier writers of France. It was that  fire, that slashing and sweeping fire, which helped to break up any big  plan of attack against the French troops yesterday morning, and from  those assembly places a great part of the German infantry never moved  all day, but spent their time, it seems, in carrying back their wounded.      Tragic Desolation of Arras    _Mr. Gibbs on May 11 described a visit to Arras, as follows:_    Since the beginning of these great battles in bleak, cold weather Spring  has come, and almost Summer, changing all the aspect of the old  battlefields and of the woods behind craterland and of the cities under  fire.    I went into one of those cities the other day, Arras, which to me and to  many of us out here is a queerly enchanted place because of its beauty,  which survives even three years of bombardment, and because of the many  great memories which it holds in its old houses and streets and the  sense of romance which lurks in its courtyards and squares, reaching  back to ancient history before its death. For Arras is dead and but the  beautiful corpse of the city that was once very fair and noble.    During the recent weeks the enemy has flung many big explosive shells  into it, so that its ruins have become more ruined and many houses  hardly touched before have now been destroyed. It was sad to see this  change, the fresh mangling of stones that had already been scarred, the  heaps of masonry that lay piled about these streets that were utterly  deserted. I walked down many of them and saw no living soul, only a few  lean cats which prowled about, slinking close to the walls and crouching  when a German shell came over with a rending noise.    Bright sunlight shone down these streets, putting a lazy glamour upon  their broken frontages and flinging back shadows from high walls, except  where shell holes let in the light. The cathedral and the great Palace  of the Bishops were unroofed, with tall pillars broken off below the  vaulting and an avalanche of white masonry about them. They were  clear-cut and dazzling under the blue sky, and one was hushed by the  tragic grandeur of these ruins.    One of the British airplanes flew low over the city, and its engine sang  loudly with a vibrant humming, and now and again the crash of a gun or a  shell loosened some stones or plaster below its wings. Other birds were  singing. Spring birds, who are not out for war but sweethearting in the  gardens of Arras.          America's Sacrifice    By Harold Begbie    [By arrangement with The London Chronicle.]      One of the finest moral actions in this war has been done by America. It  is action on a gigantic scale, and yet of a directly personal character.  Insufficient publicity, I think, has been given to this action.    Is it realized by the people of this country that America has already  saved us from capitulating to the enemy? Either we should have been  forced into this surrender (with our armies unbroken and our munitions  of war unexhausted) or we should at this moment be struggling to live  and work and fight on one-third of our present rations.    America is sending to these islands almost two-thirds of our food  supplies. Sixty-five per cent. of the essential foodstuffs eaten by the  British citizen comes to him from the American Continent. This in itself  is something which calls for our lively gratitude. But there is a  quality in the action of America which should intensify our gratitude.  For these American supplies, essential to our health and safety,  represent in very large measure the personal and voluntary  self-sacrifice of the individual American citizen. They are not crumbs  from the table of Dives. They are not the commandeered supplies of an  autocratic Government. They represent, rather, the kindly, difficult,  and entirely willing self-sacrifice of a whole nation, the vast majority  of whom are working people.    There is only one altar for this act of sacrifice--it is the table of  the American working classes. And the rite is performed by men, women,  and children, at every meal of the day, day after day, week after week.    This act of self-sacrifice, let us remember, is made in the midst of  plenty. Well might the American housewife ask why she should deprive her  children of food, why she should institute wheatless and meatless days,  when all about her there is a visible superabundance of these things.  Questions such as this are natural enough on the other side of the  Atlantic, and on the other side of the American continent, 5,000 miles  away from the battlefields of France.    But the citizens of America do not ask such questions. With a  cheerfulness and a courage which are as vigorous as their industry, and  with a moral earnestness which is by far the greatest demonstration  America has yet given to the world of American character, these people  so far away from us on the other side of the Atlantic have willingly and  with no coercion by the State denied themselves for the sake of the  Entente. They are going short, they are going hungry, for our sakes.  They are practicing an intimate self-sacrifice in order that we may hold  our own till their sons come to fight at our side. All over America the  individual American citizen is making this self-sacrifice, and making it  without a murmur. He is feeding, by his personal self-sacrifice, not  only these islands, but France, Italy, and many of the neutrals.    This great demonstration of character has had no other impetus than the  simple declaration of the facts by Herbert Hoover, the man who fed  Belgium. Hoover has told his countrymen how things stand. That is all.  The Winter of 1918, he declared to them, will prove to mankind whether  or not the American Nation \"is capable of individual self-sacrifice to  save the world.\" His propaganda has never descended to unworthy levels.  He has appealed always to the conscience of his countrymen. He has  spoken of \"a personal obligation upon every one of us toward some  individual abroad who will suffer privation to the extent of our own  individual negligence.\"    America has answered this appeal in a manner which marks her out as one  of the greatest moral forces in the world. It should be known out there,  in the farmhouses and cottages of the American Continent, that the  people of this country are mindful of America's self-sacrifice, and are  grateful.

Would you allow me to accompany you when you make  your attempt?\"    \"I will be glad of your company, if you can drive a tank. I want to take  Carnes with me, and the tank will only hold two besides the driver.\"    \"I can drive a tractor.\"    \"In that case you should master the tricks of tank driving in short  order. Get familiar with it and we'll appoint you as driver. We'll be  ready to go in to-night, but I am going to wait a day. Our friend was  fed last night, and there is less chance he'll be about.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The early part of the next evening was marked by howls and screams  coming from the mouth of the cave. As the night wore on the noises were  quite evidently coming nearer and the sentries watched the cave mouth  nervously, ready to bolt and scatter according to their orders at the  first alarm. About two A. M. the doctor and Carnes climbed into the tank  beside Lieutenant Leffingwell, and the machine moved slowly into the  cave. A search-light on the front of the tank lighted the way for them  and, attached to a frame which held it some distance ahead of them, was  a luckless sheep.    \"Keep your eye on the mutton, Carnes,\" cautioned the doctor. \"As soon as  anything happens to it, shut off the search-light and let me try to get  a picture. As soon as I have made my exposures I'll tell you, and you  can snap it on again. Lieutenant, when the picture is made, turn your  tank and make for the entrance to the cave. If we are lucky, we'll get  out.\"    Forward the tank crawled, the sheep bleating and trying to break loose  from the bonds which held it. It was impossible to hear much over the  roar of the motor, but presently Dr. Bird leaned forward, his eyes  shining.    \"I smell musk,\" he announced. \"Get ready for action.\"    Even as he spoke the sheep was suddenly lifted into the air. It gave a  final bleat of terror, and then its head was torn from its body.    \"Quick, Carnes!\" shouted the doctor.    The search-light went out, and Carnes and the lieutenant could hear the  slide of the ultra-violet light which Dr. Bird was manipulating open.  For two or three minutes the doctor worked with his apparatus.    \"All right!\" he cried suddenly. \"Lights on and get out of here!\"    Carnes snapped on the search-light and Lieutenant Leffingwell swung the  tank around and headed for the cave mouth. For a few feet their progress  was unhindered and then the tank ceased its forward motion, although the  motor still roared and the track slid on the cave floor. Carnes watched  with horror as one side of the tank bent slowly in toward him. There was  a rending sound, and a portion of the heavy steel fabric was torn away.  Dr. Bird bent over something on the floor of the tank. Presently he  straightened up and threw a small object into the darkness. There was a  flash of light, and bits of flaming phosphorus flew in every direction.  The anchor which held the tank was suddenly loosed and the machine  crawled forward at full speed, while a roar as of escaping air mingled  with a bellowing shriek burdened the smoke-laden air.    \"Faster!\" cried the doctor, as he threw another grenade.           *       *       *       *       *    Lieutenant Leffingwell got the last bit of speed possible out of the  tank and they reached the cave mouth without further molestation.    \"I had an idea that our friend wouldn't care to pass through a  phosphorus screen,\" said Dr. Bird with a chuckle as he climbed out of  the tank. \"He must have been rather severely burned the other day, and  once burned is usually twice shy. Where is Major Brown?\"    The commanding officer stepped forward.    \"Drive a couple of cattle into the cave, Major,\" directed Dr. Bird. \"I  want to fill that brute up and keep him quiet for a while. I'm going to  develop my films.\"    Lieutenant Leffingwell and Carnes peered over the doctor's shoulders as  he manipulated his films in a developing bath. Gradually vague lines and  blotches made their appearance on one of the films, but the form was  indistinct. Dr. Bird dropped the films in a fixing tank and straightened  up.    \"We have something, gentlemen,\" he announced, \"but I can't tell yet how  clear it is. It will take those films fifteen minutes to fix, and then  we'll know.\"    In a quarter of an hour he lifted the first film from the tank and held  it to the light. The film showed a blank. With an exclamation of  disappointment he lifted a second and third film from the tank, with the  same result He raised the fourth one.    \"Good Lord!\" gasped Carnes.           *       *       *       *       *    In the plate could be plainly seen the hind quarters of the sheep held  in the grasp of such a monster as even the drug-laden brain of an opium  smoker never pictured. Judging from the sheep, the monster stood about  twenty feet tall, and its frame was surmounted by a head resembling an  overgrown frog. Enormous jaws were opened to seize the sheep but, to the  amazement of the three observers, the jaws were entirely toothless.  Where teeth were to be expected, long parallel ridges of what looked  like bare bone, appeared, without even a rudimentary segregation into  teeth. The body of the monster was long and snakelike, and was borne on  long, heavy legs ending in feet with three long toes, armed with vicious  claws. The crowning horror of the creature was its forelegs. There were  of enormous length, thin and attenuated looking, and ended in huge  misshapen hands, knobby and blotched, which grasped the sheep in the  same manner as human hands. The eyes were as large as dinner plates, and  they were glaring at the camera with an expression of fiendish  malevolence which made Carnes shudder.    \"How does that huge thing ever get through that crack we examined?\"  demanded the lieutenant.    Dr. Bird rubbed his head thoughtfully.    \"It's not an amphibian,\" he muttered, \"as is plainly shown by the shape  of the limbs and the lack of a tail, and yet it appears to have scales  of the true fish type. It corresponds to no recovered fossil, and I am  inclined to believe it is unique. The nervous organisation must be very  low, judging from the lack of forehead and the general conformation. It  has enormous strength, and yet the arms look feeble.\"    \"It can't get through that crack,\" insisted the lieutenant.    \"Apparently not,\" replied the doctor. \"Wait a moment, though. Look at  this!\"    He pointed to the great disproportion between the length and diameter of  the forelegs, and then to the hind legs.    \"Either this is grave distortion or there is something mighty queer  about that conformation. No animal could be constructed like that.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He turned the film so that an oblique light fell on it. As he did so he  gave a cry of astonishment.    \"Look here!\" he said sharply. \"It does get through that crack! Look at  those arms and hands! There is the answer. This creature is tall and  broad, but from front to rear it can measure only a few inches. The same  must be true of the froglike head. That animal has been developed to  live and move in a low roofed cavern, and to pass through openings only  a few inches wide. Its bulk is all in two dimensions!\"    \"I believe you're right,\" said Carnes as he studied the film.    \"There is no doubt of it,\" answered the doctor. \"Look at those paws,  too, Carnes. That substance isn't bone, it's gum. The thing is so young  and helpless that it hasn't cut its teeth yet. It must be a baby, and  that is the reason why it made its way into the cave when no other of  its kind ever has.\"    \"How large are full grown ones if this is a baby?\" asked the  lieutenant.    \"The Lord alone knows,\" replied Dr. Bird. \"I hope that I never have to  face one and find out. Well, now that we know what we are fighting, we  ought to be able to settle its hash.\"    \"High explosive?\" suggested the lieutenant.    \"I don't think so. With such a low nervous organization, we would have  to tear it practically to pieces to kill it, and I am anxious to keep it  from mutilation for scientific study. I have an idea, but I'll have to  study a while before I am sure of the details. Send me the radio  operator.\"    The next day the Bureau mechanics began to dismount the apparatus from  the tank and to assemble another elaborate contrivance. Before they had  made an end of the work additional equipment arrived from Washington,  which was incorporated in the new set-up. At length Dr. Bird pronounced  himself ready for the attempt.           *       *       *       *       *    Under his direction, three cattle were driven into the cave and there  tethered. They were there the next morning unharmed, but the second  night the now familiar bellowing and howling came from the depths of the  cave and in the morning two of the cattle were gone.    \"That will keep him quiet for a day or two,\" said the doctor, \"and now  to work!\"    The tank made its way into the cave, dragging after it two huge cables  which led to an engine-driven generator outside the cave. These cables  were attached to the terminals of a large motor which was set up in the  cave near the place where the cattle were customarily tethered. This  motor was the actuating force which turned two generators, one large and  one small. The smaller one was mounted on a platform on wheels, which  also contained the spark gaps, the reflectors and other apparatus which  produced the beam of ultra-violet light which had been used to  photograph the monster.    From the larger generator led two copper bars. One of these was  connected to a huge copper plate which was laid flat on the floor of the  cave. The other led to a platform which was erected on huge porcelain  insulators some fifteen feet above the floor. Huge condensers were set  up on this platform, and Dr. Bird announced himself in readiness.    A steer was dragged into the cave and up a temporary runway which led"]]]
