'We only caught  Albert-next-door.'    'Oh, Albert-next-door!' said Dora contemptuously, and I felt more  comfortable; for even after I didn't say, 'Who asked you, and cetera,'  I was afraid Dora was going to come the good elder sister over us. She  does that a jolly sight too often.    Dicky looked up from the paper he was reading and said, 'This sounds  likely,' and he read out--        'L100 secures partnership in lucrative business for sale of      useful patent.  L10 weekly.  No personal attendance necessary.      Jobbins, 300, Old Street Road.'    'I wish we could secure that partnership,' said Oswald. He is twelve,  and a very thoughtful boy for his age.    Alice looked up from her painting. She was trying to paint a fairy  queen's frock with green bice, and it wouldn't rub. There is something  funny about green bice. It never will rub off; no matter how expensive  your paintbox is--and even boiling water is very little use.    She said, 'Bother the bice! And, Oswald, it's no use thinking about  that. Where are we to get a hundred pounds?'    'Ten pounds a week is five pounds to us,' Oswald went on--he had done  the sum in his head while Alice was talking--'because partnership means  halves. It would be A1.'    Noel sat sucking his pencil--he had been writing poetry as usual. I saw  the first two lines--         I wonder why Green Bice       Is never very nice.    Suddenly he said, 'I wish a fairy would come down the chimney and drop a  jewel on the table--a jewel worth just a hundred pounds.'    'She might as well give you the hundred pounds while she was about it,'  said Dora.    'Or while she was about it she might as well give us five pounds a  week,' said Alice.    'Or fifty,' said I.    'Or five hundred,' said Dicky.    I saw H. O. open his mouth, and I knew he was going to say, 'Or five  thousand,' so I said--    'Well, she won't give us fivepence, but if you'd only do as I am always  saying, and rescue a wealthy old gentleman from deadly peril he would  give us a pot of money, and we could have the partnership and five  pounds a week. Five pounds a week would buy a great many things.'    Then Dicky said, 'Why shouldn't we borrow it?' So we said, 'Who from?'  and then he read this out of the paper--         MONEY PRIVATELY WITHOUT FEES       THE BOND STREET BANK       Manager, Z. Rosenbaum.         Advances cash from L20 to L10,000 on ladies' or gentlemen's       note of hand alone, without security.  No fees.  No inquiries.       Absolute privacy guaranteed.    'What does it all mean?' asked H. O.    'It means that there is a kind gentleman who has a lot of money, and he  doesn't know enough poor people to help, so he puts it in the paper  that he will help them, by lending them his money--that's it, isn't it,  Dicky?'    Dora explained this and Dicky said, 'Yes.' And H. O. said he was a  Generous Benefactor, like in Miss Edgeworth. Then Noel wanted to know  what a note of hand was, and Dicky knew that, because he had read it in  a book, and it was just a letter saying you will pay the money when you  can, and signed with your name.    'No inquiries!' said Alice. 'Oh--Dicky--do you think he would?'    'Yes, I think so,' said Dicky. 'I wonder Father doesn't go to this kind  gentleman. I've seen his name before on a circular in Father's study.'    'Perhaps he has.' said Dora.    But the rest of us were sure he hadn't, because, of course, if he had,  there would have been more money to buy nice things. Just then Pincher  jumped up and knocked over the painting-water. He is a very careless  dog. I wonder why painting-water is always such an ugly colour? Dora ran  for a duster to wipe it up, and H. O. dropped drops of the water on his  hands and said he had got the plague. So we played at the plague for a  bit, and I was an Arab physician with a bath-towel turban, and cured  the plague with magic acid-drops. After that it was time for dinner, and  after dinner we talked it all over and settled that we would go and see  the Generous Benefactor the very next day. But we thought perhaps the G.  B.--it is short for Generous Benefactor--would not like it if there were  so many of us. I have often noticed that it is the worst of our being  six--people think six a great many, when it's children. That sentence  looks wrong somehow. I mean they don't mind six pairs of boots, or six  pounds of apples, or six oranges, especially in equations, but they  seem to think you ought not to have five brothers and sisters. Of course  Dicky was to go, because it was his idea. Dora had to go to Blackheath  to see an old lady, a friend of Father's, so she couldn't go. Alice  said _she_ ought to go, because it said, 'Ladies _and_ gentlemen,' and  perhaps the G. B. wouldn't let us have the money unless there were both  kinds of us.    H. O. said Alice wasn't a lady; and she said _he_ wasn't going, anyway.  Then he called her a disagreeable cat, and she began to cry.    But Oswald always tries to make up quarrels, so he said--    'You're little sillies, both of you!'    And Dora said, 'Don't cry, Alice; he only meant you weren't a grown-up  lady.'    Then H. O. said, 'What else did you think I meant, Disagreeable?'    So Dicky said, 'Don't be disagreeable yourself, H. O. Let her alone and  say you're sorry, or I'll jolly well make you!'    So H. O. said he was sorry. Then Alice kissed him and said she was sorry  too; and after that H. O. gave her a hug, and said, 'Now I'm _really and  truly_ sorry,' So it was all right.    Noel went the last time any of us went to London, so he was out of it,  and Dora said she would take him to Blackheath if we'd take H. O. So as  there'd been a little disagreeableness we thought it was better to take  him, and we did. At first we thought we'd tear our oldest things a bit  more, and put some patches of different colours on them, to show the  G. B. how much we wanted money. But Dora said that would be a sort  of cheating, pretending we were poorer than we are. And Dora is right  sometimes, though she is our elder sister. Then we thought we'd better  wear our best things, so that the G. B. might see we weren't so very  poor that he couldn't trust us to pay his money back when we had it. But  Dora said that would be wrong too. So it came to our being quite honest,  as Dora said, and going just as we were, without even washing our faces  and hands; but when I looked at H. O. in the train I wished we had not  been quite so particularly honest.    Every one who reads this knows what it is like to go in the train, so I  shall not tell about it--though it was rather fun, especially the part  where the guard came for the tickets at Waterloo, and H. O. was under  the seat and pretended to be a dog without a ticket. We went to Charing  Cross, and we just went round to Whitehall to see the soldiers and then  by St James's for the same reason--and when we'd looked in the shops a  bit we got to Brook Street, Bond Street. It was a brass plate on a  door next to a shop--a very grand place, where they sold bonnets and  hats--all very bright and smart, and no tickets on them to tell you  the price. We rang a bell and a boy opened the door and we asked for Mr  Rosenbaum. The boy was not polite; he did not ask us in. So then Dicky  gave him his visiting card; it was one of Father's really, but the  name is the same, Mr Richard Bastable, and we others wrote our names  underneath. I happened to have a piece of pink chalk in my pocket and we  wrote them with that.    Then the boy shut the door in our faces and we waited on the step. But  presently he came down and asked our business. So Dicky said--    'Money advanced, young shaver! and don't be all day about it!'    And then he made us wait again, till I was quite stiff in my legs, but  Alice liked it because of looking at the hats and bonnets, and at last  the door opened, and the boy said--    'Mr Rosenbaum will see you,' so we wiped our feet on the mat, which said  so, and we went up stairs with soft carpets and into a room. It was a  beautiful room. I wished then we had put on our best things, or at least  washed a little. But it was too late now.    The room had velvet curtains and a soft, soft carpet, and it was full  of the most splendid things. Black and gold cabinets, and china, and  statues, and pictures. There was a picture of a cabbage and a pheasant  and a dead hare that was just like life, and I would have given worlds  to have it for my own. The fur was so natural I should never have been  tired of looking at it; but Alice liked the one of the girl with  the broken jug best. Then besides the pictures there were clocks and  candlesticks and vases, and gilt looking-glasses, and boxes of cigars  and scent and things littered all over the chairs and tables. It was a  wonderful place, and in the middle of all the splendour was a little old  gentleman with a very long black coat and a very long white beard and a  hookey nose--like a falcon. And he put on a pair of gold spectacles and  looked at us as if he knew exactly how much our clothes were worth.    And then, while we elder ones were thinking how to begin, for we had  all said 'Good morning' as we came in, of course, H. O. began before we  could stop him. He said:    'Are you the G. B.?'    'The _what_?' said the little old gentleman.    'The G. B.,' said H. O., and I winked at him to shut up, but he didn't  see me, and the G. B. did. He waved his hand at _me_ to shut up, so I  had to, and H. O. went on--'It stands for Generous Benefactor.'    The old gentleman frowned. Then he said, 'Your Father sent you here, I  suppose?'    'No he didn't,' said Dicky. 'Why did you think so?'    The old gentleman held out the card, and I explained that we took that  because Father's name happens to be the same as Dicky's.    'Doesn't he know you've come?'    'No,' said Alice, 'we shan't tell him till we've got"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#13)"],[1,"ran on their  incessant journey. Messengers and men on unknown businesses shot along  the drooping cables and the frail bridges were crowded with men. It was  like peering into a gigantic glass hive, and it lay vertically below him  with only a tough glass of unknown thickness to save him from a fall.  The street showed warm and lit, and Graham was wet now to the skin with  thawing snow, and his feet were numbed with cold. For a space he could  not move.    \"Come on!\" cried his guide, with terror in his voice. \"Come on!\"    Graham reached the pitch of the roof by an effort.    Over the ridge, following his guide's example, he turned about and slid  backward down the opposite slope very swiftly, amid a little avalanche  of snow While he was sliding he thought of what would happen if some  broken gap should come in his way. At the edge he stumbled to his feet  ankle deep in slush thanking heaven for an opaque footing again. His  guide was already clambering up a metal screen to a level expanse.    Through the spare snowflakes above this loomed another line of vast  windmills, and then suddenly the amorphous tumult of the rotating wheels  was pierced with a deafening sound. It was a mechanical shrilling of  extraordinary intensity that seemed to come simultaneously from every  point of the compass.    \"They have missed us already!\" cried Graham's guide in an accent of  terror, and suddenly, with a blinding flash, the night became day.    Above the driving snow, from the summits of the wind-wheels, appeared  vast masts carrying globes of livid light. They receded in illimitable  vistas in every direction. As far as his eye could penetrate the  snowfall they glared.    \"Get on this,\" cried Graham's conductor, and thrust him forward to a  long grating of snowless metal that ran like a band between two slightly  sloping expanses of snow. It felt warm to Graham's benurrled feet, and a  faint eddy of steam rose from it.    \"Come on!\" shouted his guide ten yards off, and, without waiting, ran  swiftly through the incandescent glare towards the iron supports of the  next range of wind-wheels. Graham, recovering from his astonishment,  followed as fast, convinced of his imminent capture.    In a score of seconds they were within a tracery of glare and black  shadows shot with moving bars beneath the monstrous wheels. Graham's  conductor ran on for some time, and suddenly darted sideways and  vanished into a black shadow in the corner of the foot of a huge  support. In another moment Graham was beside him.    They cowered panting and stared out.    The scene upon which Graham looked was very wild and strange. The snow  had now almost ceased; only a belated flake passed now and again across  the picture. But the broad stretch of level before them was a ghastly  white, broken only by gigantic masses and moving shapes and lengthy  strips of impenetrable darkness, vast ungainly Titans of shadow. All  about them, huge metallic structures, iron girders, inhumanly vast as it  seemed to him, interlaced, and the edges of wind-wheels, scarcely moving  in the lull, passed in great shining curves steeper and steeper up  into a luminous haze. Wherever the snow-spangled light struck down,  beams and girders, and incessant bands running with a halting,  indomitable resolution passed upward and downward into the black. And  with all that mighty activity, with an omnipresent sense of motive and  design, this snow-clad desolation of mechanism seemed void of all  human presence save themselves, seemed as trackless and deserted and  unfrequented by men as some inaccessible Alpine snowfield.    \"They will be chasing us,\" cried the leader. \"We are scarcely halfway  there yet. Cold as it is we must hide here for a space--at least until  it snows more thickly again.\"    His teeth chattered in his head.    \"Where are the markets?\" asked Graham staring out. \"Where are all the  people?\"    The other made no answer.      \"Look!\" whispered Graham, crouched close, and became very still.    The snow had suddenly become thick again, and sliding with the whirling  eddies out of the black pit of the sky came something, vague and large  and very swift. It came down in a steep curve and swept round, wide  wings extended and a trail of white condensing steam behind it, rose  with an easy swiftness and went gliding up the air, swept horizontally  forward in a wide curve, and vanished again in the steaming specks of  snow. And, through the ribs of its body, Graham saw two little men, very  minute and active, searching the snowy areas about him, as it seemed to  him, with field glasses. For a second they were clear, then hazy through  a thick whirl of snow, then small and distant, and in a minute they were  gone.    \"Now!\" cried his companion. \"Come!\"    He pulled Graham's sleeve, and incontinently the two were running  headlong down the arcade of ironwork beneath the wind-wheels. Graham,  running blindly, collided with his leader, who had turned back on him  suddenly. He found himself within a dozen yards of a black chasm. It  extended as far as he could see right and left. It seemed to cut off  their progress in either direction.    \"Do as I do,\" whispered his guide. He lay down and crawled to the edge,  thrust his head over and twisted until one leg hung. He seemed to feel  for something with his foot, found it, and went sliding over the edge  into the gulf. His head reappeared. \"It is a ledge,\" he whispered. \"In  the dark all the way along. Do as I did.\"    Graham hesitated, went down upon all fours, crawled to the edge, and  peered into a velvety blackness. For a sickly moment he had courage  neither to go on nor retreat, then he sat and hung his leg down, felt  his guide's hands pulling at him, had a horrible sensation of sliding  over the edge into the unfathomable, splashed, and felt himself in a  slushy gutter, impenetrably dark.    \"This way,\" whispered the voice, and he began crawling along the gutter  through the trickling thaw, pressing himself against the wall. They  continued along it for some minutes. He seemed to pass through a hundred  stages of misery, to pass minute after minute through a hundred degrees  of cold, damp, and exhaustion. In a little while he ceased to feel his  hands and feet.    The gutter sloped downwards. He observed that they were now many feet  below the edge of the buildings. Rows of spectral white shapes like the  ghosts of blind-drawn windows rose above them. They came to the end of  a cable fastened above one of these white windows, dimly visible and  dropping into impenetrable shadows. Suddenly his hand came against his  guide's.    \"Still!\" whispered the latter very softly.    He looked up with a start and saw the huge wings of the flying machine  gliding slowly and noiselessly overhead athwart the broad band of  snow-flecked grey-blue sky. In a moment it was hidden again.    \"Keep still; they were just turning.\"    For awhile both were motionless, then Graham's companion stood up,  and reaching towards the fastenings of the cable fumbled with some  indistinct tackle.    \"What is that?\" asked Graham.    The only answer was a faint cry. The man crouched motionless. Graham  peered and saw his face dimly. He was staring down the long ribbon of  sky, and Graham, following his eyes, saw the flying machine small and  faint and remote. Then he saw that the wings spread on either side,  that it headed towards them, that every moment it grew larger. It was  following the edge of the chasm towards them.    The man's movements became convulsive. He thrust two cross bars into  Graham's hand. Graham could not see them, he ascertained their form by  feeling. They were slung by thin cords to the cable. On the cord were  hand grips of some soft elastic substance. \"Put the cross between your  legs,\" whispered the guide hysterically, \"and grip the holdfasts. Grip  tightly, grip!\"    Graham did as he was told.    \"Jump,\" said the voice. \"In heaven's name, jump!\"    For one momentous second Graham could not speak. He was glad afterwards  that darkness hid his face. He said nothing. He began to tremble  violently. He looked sideways at the swift shadow that swallowed up the  sky as it rushed upon him.    \"Jump! Jump--in God's name! Or they will have us,\" cried Graham's guide,  and in the violence of his passion thrust him forward.    Graham tottered convulsively, gave a sobbing cry, a cry in spite of  himself, and then, as the flying machine swept over them, fell forward  into the pit of that darkness, seated on the cross wood and holding  the ropes with the clutch of death. Something cracked, something rapped  smartly against a wall. He heard the pulley of the cradle hum on its  rope. He heard the aeronauts shout. He felt a pair of knees digging into  his back.... He was sweeping headlong through the air, falling through  the air. All his strength was in his hands. He would have screamed but  he had no breath.    He shot into a blinding light that made him grip the tighter. He  recognised the great passage with the running ways, the hanging lights  and interlacing girders. They rushed upward and by him. He had a  momentary impression of a great circular aperture yawning to swallow him  up.    He was in the dark again, falling, falling, gripping with aching hands,  and behold! a clap of sound, a burst of light, and he was in a brightly  lit hall with a roaring multitude of people beneath his feet. The  people! His people! A proscenium, a stage rushed up towards him, and his  cable swept down to a circular aperture to the right of this. He felt he  was travelling slower, and suddenly very much slower. He distinguished  shouts of \"Saved! The Master. He is safe!\" The stage rushed up towards  him with rapidly diminishing swiftness. Then--    He heard the man clinging behind him shout as if suddenly terrified,  and this shout was echoed by a shout from below. He felt that he was no  longer gliding along the cable but falling with it."]]]
