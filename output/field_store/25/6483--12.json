Adams first recalculated all known causes of disturbance, using the  latest determinations of the planetary masses. Still the errors were  nearly as great as ever.  He could now, however, use these errors as  being actually due to the perturbations produced by the unknown  planet.    In 1844, assuming a circular orbit, and a mean distance agreeing with  Bode's law, he obtained a first approximation to the position of the  supposed planet.  He then asked Professor Challis, of Cambridge, to  procure the latest observations of Uranus from Greenwich, which Airy  immediately supplied. Then the whole work was recalculated from the  beginning, with more exactness, and assuming a smaller mean distance.    In September, 1845, he handed to Challis the elements of the  hypothetical planet, its mass, and its apparent position for September  30th, 1845. On September 22nd Challis wrote to Airy explaining the  matter, and declaring his belief in Adams's capabilities. When Adams  called on him Airy was away from home, but at the end of October,  1845, he called again, and left a paper with full particulars of his  results, which had, for the most part, reduced the discrepancies to  about 1\". As a matter of fact, it has since been found that the  heliocentric place of the new planet then given was correct within  about 2 deg.    Airy wrote expressing his interest, and asked for particulars about  the radius vector. Adams did not then reply, as the answer to this  question could be seen to be satisfactory by looking at the data  already supplied.  He was a most unassuming man, and would not push  himself forward. He may have felt, after all the work he had done,  that Airy's very natural inquiry showed no proportionate desire to  search for the planet.  Anyway, the matter lay in embryo for nine  months.    Meanwhile, one of the ablest French astronomers, Le Verrier,  experienced in computing perturbations, was independently at work,  knowing nothing about Adams. He applied to his calculations every  possible refinement, and, considering the novelty of the problem, his  calculation was one of the most brilliant in the records of  astronomy. In criticism it has been said that these were exhibitions  of skill rather than helps to a solution of the particular problem,  and that, in claiming to find the elements of the orbit within certain  limits, he was claiming what was, under the circumstances, impossible,  as the result proved.    In June, 1846, Le Verrier announced, in the _Comptes Rendus de  l'Academie des Sciences_, that the longitude of the disturbing planet,  for January 1st, 1847, was 325, and that the probable error did not  exceed 10 deg.    This result agreed so well with Adams's (within 1 deg.) that Airy urged  Challis to apply the splendid Northumberland equatoreal, at Cambridge,  to the search.  Challis, however, had already prepared an exhaustive  plan of attack which must in time settle the point.  His first work  was to observe, and make a catalogue, or chart, of all stars near  Adams's position.    On August 31st, 1846, Le Verrier published the concluding  part of his labours.    On September 18th, 1846, Le Verrier communicated his results to the  Astronomers at Berlin, and asked them to assist in searching for the  planet. By good luck Dr. Bremiker had just completed a star-chart of  the very part of the heavens including Le Verrier's position; thus  eliminating all of Challis's preliminary work. The letter was received  in Berlin on September 23rd; and the same evening Galle found the new  planet, of the eighth magnitude, the size of its disc agreeing with Le  Verrier's prediction, and the heliocentric longitude agreeing within  57'. By this time Challis had recorded, without reduction, the  observations of 3,150 stars, as a commencement for his search.  On  reducing these, he found a star, observed on August 12th, which was  not in the same place on July 30th. This was the planet, and he had  also observed it on August 4th.    The feeling of wonder, admiration, and enthusiasm aroused by this  intellectual triumph was overwhelming.  In the world of astronomy  reminders are met every day of the terrible limitations of human  reasoning powers; and every success that enables the mind's eye to see  a little more clearly the meaning of things has always been heartily  welcomed by those who have themselves been engaged in like  researches. But, since the publication of the _Principia_, in 1687,  there is probably no analytical success which has raised among  astronomers such a feeling of admiration and gratitude as when Adams  and Le Verrier showed the inequalities in Uranus's motion to mean that  an unknown planet was in a certain place in the heavens, where it was  found.    At the time there was an unpleasant display of international jealousy.  The British people thought that the earlier date of Adams's work, and  of the observation by Challis, entitled him to at least an equal share  of credit with Le Verrier. The French, on the other hand, who, on the  announcement of the discovery by Galle, glowed with pride in the new  proof of the great powers of their astronomer, Le Verrier, whose life  had a long record of successes in calculation, were incredulous on  being told that it had all been already done by a young man whom they  had never heard of.    These displays of jealousy have long since passed away, and there is  now universally an _entente cordiale_ that to each of these great men  belongs equally the merit of having so thoroughly calculated this  inverse problem of perturbations as to lead to the immediate discovery  of the unknown planet, since called Neptune.    It was soon found that the planet had been observed, and its position  recorded as a fixed star by Lalande, on May 8th and 10th, 1795.    Mr. Lassel, in the same year, 1846, with his two-feet reflector,  discovered a satellite, with retrograde motion, which gave the mass of  the planet about a twentieth of that of Jupiter.

OBSERVATION        10. INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION--STATE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.      Having now traced the progress of physical astronomy up to the time  when very striking proofs of the universality of the law of  gravitation convinced the most sceptical, it must still be borne in  mind that, while gravitation is certainly the principal force  governing the motions of the heavenly bodies, there may yet be a  resisting medium in space, and there may be electric and magnetic  forces to deal with. There may, further, be cases where the effects of  luminous radiative repulsion become apparent, and also Crookes'  vacuum-effects described as \"radiant matter.\" Nor is it quite certain  that Laplace's proofs of the instantaneous propagation of gravity are  final.    And in the future, as in the past, Tycho Brahe's dictum must be  maintained, that all theory shall be preceded by accurate  observations. It is the pride of astronomers that their science stands  above all others in the accuracy of the facts observed, as well as in  the rigid logic of the mathematics used for interpreting these facts.    It is interesting to trace historically the invention of those  instruments of precision which have led to this result, and, without  entering on the details required in a practical handbook, to note the  guiding principles of construction in different ages.    It is very probable that the Chaldeans may have made spheres, like the  armillary sphere, for representing the poles of the heavens; and with  rings to show the ecliptic and zodiac, as well as the equinoctial and  solstitial colures; but we have no record. We only know that the tower  of Belus, on an eminence, was their observatory.  We have, however,  distinct records of two such spheres used by the Chinese about 2500  B.C.  Gnomons, or some kind of sundial, were used by the Egyptians and  others; and many of the ancient nations measured the obliquity of the  ecliptic by the shadows of a vertical column in summer and winter. The  natural horizon was the only instrument of precision used by those who  determined star positions by the directions of their risings and  settings; while in those days the clepsydra, or waterclock, was the  best instrument for comparing their times of rising and setting.    About 300 B.C. an observatory fitted with circular instruments for  star positions was set up at Alexandria, the then centre of  civilisation. We know almost nothing about the instruments used by  Hipparchus in preparing his star catalogues and his lunar and solar  tables; but the invention of the astrolabe is attributed to him.[1]    In more modern times Nuremberg became a centre of astronomical  culture. Waltherus, of that town, made really accurate observations of  star altitudes, and of the distances between stars; and in 1484  A.D. he used a kind of clock. Tycho Brahe tried these, but discarded  them as being inaccurate.    Tycho Brahe (1546-1601 A.D.) made great improvements in armillary  spheres, quadrants, sextants, and large celestial globes. With these  he measured the positions of stars, or the distance of a comet from  several known stars. He has left us full descriptions of them,  illustrated by excellent engravings. Previous to his time such  instruments were made of wood.  Tycho always used metal. He paid the  greatest attention to the stability of mounting, to the orientation of  his instruments, to the graduation of the arcs by the then new method  of transversals, and to the aperture sight used upon his  pointer. There were no telescopes in his day, and no pendulum  clocks. He recognised the fact that there must be instrumental  errors.

Post.    \"Antaux\" means \"before\" (time), \"Ni revenos antaux Mardo\", We shall  return before Tuesday, \"in front of\" (place), \"Antaux la domo\", Before  the house. Before verbs \"antaux ol\" is used, as \"Lavu vin, antaux ol  mangxi\", Wash (yourself) before eating.    \"Post\" means \"after\" (time), \"behind\" (place).    Care must be taken in using \"antaux\" and \"post\" to arrange the sentence  so that there can be no doubt as to whether time or place is referred  to. \"He came before his father,\" in place or position, \"i.e.\", in front  of his father, is \"Li venis antaux sia patro\", but if \"before in time\"  is meant, it must be \"Li venis antaux ol lia patro\" (\"venis\"). \"Li venis  post sia patro\" means He came behind his father; if we mean \"after his  father came\" we may use \"kiam\", and say \"Li venis post, kiam lia patro  venis\".    To express \"time past,\" \"ago,\" \"antaux\" is used, as \"Antaux tri tagoj\",  Three days ago. \"Antaux longe\", A long time ago. \"Antaux nelonge\", Not  long ago.    To express \"in\" a time to come \"post\" is used, as I will come in three  days, \"Mi venos post tri tagoj\". \"Post nelonge\", In a short time.

Cxirkaux.    \"Dum\" means \"during\", as \"Dum mia tuta vivo\", During my whole life. It  is not much used as a preposition, that is, before a noun, \"en la dauxro  de\" being better, as \"En la dauxro de mia tuta vivo\", In (the duration  of) my whole life; or the preposition is omitted altogether, as \"La  tutan tagon mi laboradis\", I used to work all day long. \"Dum\", meaning  \"while, whilst\", is often used at the beginning of a sentence. \"Dume\"  means meanwhile, or, in the meantime.    \"Gxis\" means \"till, until, up to, as far as\". \"Atendu gxis Sabato\", Wait  until Saturday. \"Iru gxis la rivero\", Go as far as the river.    \"Cxirkaux\" means \"about\" or \"around, somewhere near\" (more or less).  \"Ili ludis cxirkaux la arbo\", They played around the tree. \"Cxirkaux  Majo ni foriros\", About May we shall go away.
