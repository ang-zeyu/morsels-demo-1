He came to know the flags of every king in Europe, he even  dabbled in history, he made inquiries at shops that understood  heraldry, but nowhere could he learn any trace of little dragons _or_  on a field _argent_. And when it seemed that for him alone those  golden dragons had fluttered he came to love them as an exile in some  desert might love the lilies of his home or as a sick man might love  swallows when he cannot easily live to another spring.    As soon as Messrs. Mergin and Chater closed, Mr. Sladden used to go  back to his dingy room and gaze though the wonderful window until it  grew dark in the city and the guard would go with a lantern round the  ramparts and the night came up like velvet, full of strange stars.  Another clue he tried to obtain one night by jotting down the shapes  of the constellations, but this led him no further, for they were  unlike any that shone upon either hemisphere.    Each day as soon as he woke he went first to the wonderful window, and  there was the city, diminutive in the distance, all shining in the  morning, and the golden dragons dancing in the sun, and the archers  stretching themselves or swinging their arms on the tops of the windy  towers. The window would not open, so that he never heard the songs  that the troubadours sang down there beneath the gilded balconies; he  did not even hear the belfries' chimes, though he saw the jack-daws  routed every hour from their homes. And the first thing that he always  did was to cast his eye round all the little towers that rose up from  the ramparts to see that the little golden dragons were flying there  on their flags. And when he saw them flaunting themselves on white  folds from every tower against the marvelous deep blue of the sky he  dressed contentedly, and, taking one last look, went off to his work  with a glory in his mind. It would have been difficult for the  customers of Messrs. Mergin and Chater to guess the precise ambition  of Mr. Sladden as he walked before them in his neat frock-coat: it was  that he might be a man-at-arms or an archer in order to fight for the  little golden dragons that flew on a white flag for an unknown king in  an inaccessible city. At first Mr. Sladden used to walk round and  round the mean street that he lived in, but he gained no clue from  that; and soon he noticed that quite different winds blew below his  wonderful window from those that blew on the other side of the house.    In August the evenings began to grow shorter: this was the very remark  that the other employees made to him at the emporium, so that he  almost feared that they suspected his secret, and he had much less  time for the wonderful window, for lights were few down there and they  blinked out early.    One morning late in August, just before he went to Business, Mr.  Sladden saw a company of pikemen running down the cobbled road towards  the gateway of the mediaeval city--Golden Dragon City he used to call  it alone in his own mind, but he never spoke of it to anyone. The next  thing that he noticed was that the archers were handling round bundles  of arrows in addition to the quivers which they wore. Heads were  thrust out of windows more than usual, a woman ran out and called some  children indoors, a knight rode down the street, and then more pikemen  appeared along the walls, and all the jack-daws were in the air. In  the street no troubadour sang. Mr. Sladden took one look along the  towers to see that the flags were flying, and all the golden dragons  were streaming in the wind. Then he had to go to Business. He took a  bus back that evening and ran upstairs. Nothing seemed to be happening  in Golden Dragon City except a crowd in the cobbled street that led  down to the gateway; the archers seemed to be reclining as usual  lazily in their towers, and then a white flag went down with all its  golden dragons; he did not see at first that all the archers were  dead. The crowd was pouring towards him, towards the precipitous wall  from which he looked; men with a white flag covered with golden  dragons were moving backwards slowly, men with another flag were  pressing them, a flag on which there was one huge red bear. Another  banner went down upon a tower. Then he saw it all: the golden dragons  were being beaten--his little golden dragons. The men of the bear were  coming under the window; what ever he threw from that height would  fall with terrific force: fire-irons, coal, his clock, whatever he  had--he would fight for his little golden dragons yet. A flame broke  out from one of the towers and licked the feet of a reclining archer;  he did not stir. And now the alien standard was out of sight directly  underneath. Mr. Sladden broke the panes of the wonderful window and  wrenched away with a poker the lead that held them. Just as the glass  broke he saw a banner covered with golden dragons fluttering still,  and then as he drew back to hurl the poker there came to him the scent  of mysterious spices, and there was nothing there, not even the  daylight, for behind the fragments of the wonderful window was nothing  but that small cupboard in which he kept his tea-things.    And though Mr. Sladden is older now and knows more of the world, and  even has a Business of his own, he has never been able to buy such  another window, and has not ever since, either from books or men,  heard any rumour at all of Golden Dragon City.        EPILOGUE      Here the fourteenth Episode of the Book of Wonder endeth and here the  relating of the Chronicles of Little Adventures at the Edge of the  World. I take farewell of my readers. But it may be we shall even meet  again, for it is still to be told how the gnomes robbed the fairies,  and of the vengeance that the fairies took, and how even the gods  themselves were troubled thereby in their sleep; and how the King of  Ool insulted the troubadours, thinking himself safe among his scores  of archers and hundreds of halberdiers, and how the troubadours stole  to his towers by night, and under his battlements by the light of the  moon made that king ridiculous for ever in song. But for this I must  first return to the Edge of the World. Behold, the caravans start."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7498"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Grown Up (#13)"],[1,"for a good part of the  way, had just driven to the station, when the bell rang and a housemaid  presently laid before Polly a card, at sight of which all the color  deserted her cheek. \"Oh, I can't see him,\" she declared involuntarily.    \"Who is it?\" asked old Mr. King, laying down the evening paper.    \"O, Grandpapa!\" cried Polly, all in a tremor at the thought of his  displeasure, \"it does not matter. I can send word that I do not see any  one now that Aunty is ill, and\"--    \"Polly, child,\" said the old gentleman, seriously displeased, \"come and  tell me at once who has called upon you.\"    So Polly, hardly knowing how, got out of her chair and silently laid the  unwelcome card in his hand.    \"Mr. Livingston Bayley,\" read the old gentleman.    \"Humph! well, upon my word, this speaks well for the young man's  perseverance. I'm very tired, but I see nothing for it but that I must  respond to this;\" and he threw aside the paper and got up to his feet.    \"Grandpapa,\" begged Polly tremblingly at his elbow, \"please don't let  him feel badly.\"    \"It isn't possible, Polly,\" cried Mr. King, looking down at her, \"that  you like this fellow--enough, I mean, to marry him?\"    \"O, Grandpapa!\" exclaimed Polly in a tone of horror.    \"Well, then, child, you must leave me to settle with him,\" said the old  gentleman with dignity. \"Don't worry; I sha'n't forget myself, nor what  is due to a Bayley,\" with a short laugh. And then she heard him go into  the drawing-room and close the door.    When he came back, which he did in the space of half an hour, his face  was wreathed in smiles, and he chuckled now and then, as he sat down in  his big chair and drew out his eyeglasses.    \"Well, Polly, child, I don't believe he will trouble you in this way  again, my dear,\" he said in a satisfied way, looking at her over the  table. \"He wanted to leave the question open; thought it impossible that  you could refuse him utterly, and was willing to wait; and asked  permission to send flowers, and all that sort of thing. But I made the  young man see exactly how the matter stood, and that's all that need be  said about it. It's done with now and forever.\" And then he took up his  paper and began to read.    \"Mamsie,\" said Phronsie, that very evening as she was getting ready for  bed, and pausing in the doorway of her little room that led out of  Mother Fisher's, \"do you suppose we can bear it another day without  Polly?\"    \"Why, yes, Phronsie,\" said Mother Fisher, giving another gentle rock to  Baby's cradle, \"of course we can, because we must. That isn't like you,  dear, to want Polly back till Aunty has got through needing her.\"    Phronsie gave a sigh and thoughtfully drew her slippered foot over the  pattern of the carpet. \"It would be so very nice,\" she said, \"if Aunty  didn't need her.\"    \"So it would,\" said her mother, \"but it won't make Polly come any  quicker to spend the time wishing for her. There, run to bed, child; you  are half an hour late to-night.\"    Phronsie turned obediently into her own little room, then came back  softly. \"I want to give Baby, Polly's good-night kiss,\" she said.    \"Very well, you may, dear,\" said Mrs. Fisher. So Phronsie bent over and  set on Baby's dear little cheek, the kiss that could not go to Polly.    \"If dear Grandpapa would only come home,\" and she sighed again.    \"But just think how beautiful it is that Aunty was not hurt so much as  the doctors feared,\" said her mother. \"Oh, Phronsie, we can't ever be  thankful enough for that.\"    \"And now maybe God will let Grandpapa and Polly come back pretty soon,\"  said Phronsie slowly, going off toward her own little room. And  presently Mrs. Fisher heard her say, \"Good-night, Mamsie dear, I'm in  bed.\"    A rap at the door, and Jane put in her head, in response to Mrs.  Fisher's \"What is it?\"    \"Oh, is Dr. Fisher here?\" asked Jane in a frightened way.    [Illustration: \"AND PLEASE MAKE DEAR PAPA GIVE HER THE RIGHT THINGS.\"]    \"No; he is downstairs in the library,\" said Mother Fisher. \"What is the  matter, Jane? Who wants him?\"    \"Oh, something dreadful is the matter with Helen Fargo, I'm afraid,  ma'am,\" said Jane. \"Griggs has just run over to say that the doctor must  come quick.\"    \"Hush!\" said Mrs. Fisher, pointing to Phronsie's wide-open door; but she  was standing beside them in her little nightdress, and heard the next  words plainly enough.    \"Run down stairs, Jane,\" commanded Mother Fisher, \"and tell the doctor  what Griggs said; just as fast as you can, Jane.\"    And in another minute in rushed the little doctor, seized his medicine  case, saying as he did so, \"I sha'n't come back here, wife, if it is  diphtheria, but go to my office and change my clothes. There's  considerable of the disease around. Good-night, child.\" He stopped to  kiss Phronsie, who lifted a pale, troubled face to his. \"Don't worry; I  guess Helen will be all right,\" and he dashed off again.    \"Now, Phronsie, child,\" said Mrs. Fisher, \"come to mother and let us  talk it over a bit.\"    So Phronsie cuddled up in Mamsie's lap, and laid her sad little cheek  where she had been so often comforted.    \"Mamsie,\" she said at last, lifting her head, \"I don't believe God will  let Helen die, because you see she's the only child that Mrs. Fargo has.  He couldn't, Mamsie.\"    \"Phronsie, darling, God knows best,\" said Mrs. Fisher, holding her  close.    \"But he wouldn't ever do it, I know,\" said Phronsie confidently; \"I'm  going to ask Him not to, and tell Him over again about Helen's being the  very only one that Mrs. Fargo has in all the world.\" So she slipped to  the floor, and went into her own room again and closed the door. \"Dear  Jesus,\" she said, kneeling by her little white bed, \"please don't take  Helen away, because her mother has only just Helen. And please make dear  papa give her the right things, so that she will live at home, and not  go to Heaven yet. Amen.\"    Then she clambered into bed, and lay looking out across the moonlight,  where the light from Helen Fargo's room twinkled through the fir-trees  on the lawn.          CHAPTER VII.    PHRONSIE.      \"I can't tell her,\" groaned Mrs. Pepper, the next morning, at sight of  Phronsie's peaceful little face. \"I never can say the word 'diphtheria'  in all this world.\"    Phronsie laughed and played with Baby quite merrily, all such time as  Miss Carruth, the governess, allowed her from the schoolroom that  morning.    \"Everything is beautiful, King dear,\" she would say on such little  flying visits to the nursery. \"Grandpapa and Polly, I do think, will be  home pretty soon; and Helen is going to get well, because you know I  asked God to let her, and he wouldn't ever, in all this world, take her  away from her mother. He wouldn't, King,\" she added confidentially in  Baby's small ear.    All day long the turreted Fargo mansion gleamed brightly in the glancing  sunlight, giving no hint of the battle for a life going on within. Mrs.  Fisher knew when her husband sent for the most celebrated doctor for  throat diseases; knew when he came; and knew also when each hour those  who were fighting the foe, were driven back baffled. And several times  she attempted to tell Phronsie something of the shadow hanging over the  little playmate's home. But Phronsie invariably put aside all her  attempts with a gentle persistence, always saying, \"He wouldn't, you  know, Mamsie.\"    And at nightfall Helen had gone; and two white little hands were folded  quietly across a young girl's breast.    No one told Phronsie that night; no one could. And she clambered into  her little white bed, after saying her old prayer; then she lay in the  moonlight again, watching Helen's house.    \"The light is out, Mamsie,\" she called, \"in Helen's room. But I suppose  she is asleep.\" And presently Mrs. Fisher, stealing in, with unshed  tears in her eyes, found her own child safe--folded in restful slumber,  her hand tucked under her cheek.    But the next morning, when she must hear it!    \"Phronsie,\" said Mrs. Fisher, \"come here, dear.\" It was after breakfast,  and Phronsie was running up into the school-room.    \"Do you mean I am not to go to Miss Carruth?\" asked Phronsie  wonderingly, and fingering her books.    \"Yes, dear. Oh, Phronsie\"--Mrs. Fisher abruptly dropped her customary  self-control, and held out her arms. \"Come here, mother's baby; I've  something bad to tell you, and you must help me, dear.\"    Phronsie came at once, with wide-open, astonished brown eyes, and  climbed up into the good lap obediently.    \"Phronsie,\" said Mrs. Fisher, swallowing the lump in her throat, and  looking at the child fixedly, \"you know Helen has been very sick.\"    \"Yes, mamma,\" said Phronsie, still in a wonder.    \"Well--and she suffered, dear, oh, so much!\"    A look of pain stole over Phronsie's face, and Mrs. Fisher hastened to  say, \"But oh. Phronsie, she can't ever suffer any more, for--for--God  has taken her home, Phronsie.\"    \"Has Helen died?\" asked Phronsie, in a sharp little voice, so unlike her  own that Mrs. Pepper shivered and held her close.    \"Oh, darling--how can I tell you? Yes, dear, God has taken her home to  Heaven.\"    \"And left Mrs. Fargo without any little girl?\" asked Phronsie, in the  same tone.    \"My dear--yes--He knows what is best,\" said poor Mrs. Fisher.    The startled look on Phronsie's little face gave way to a grieved  expression, that slowly settled on each feature.    \"Let me get down, Mamsie,\" she said, quietly, and gently struggling to  free herself.    \"Oh, Phronsie, what are you going to do?\" cried Mrs. Fisher. \"Do sit  with mother.\"    \"I must think it out, Mamsie,\" said Phronsie, with grave decision,  getting on her feet, and she went slowly up the stairs, and into her own  room; then closed the door.    And all that day she said nothing; even when Mother Fisher begged her to  come and talk it over with her, Phronsie would say, \"I can't, Mamsie  dear, it won't talk itself.\" But she was gentle and"]]]
