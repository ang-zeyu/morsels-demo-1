The Herolds came next, and had  Aunt Sarah's front garden bench, the red one. Mildred Manners' folks  paid ten cents each too, and they had the big green bench from the side  porch.    \"Give Mrs. Burns a front seat,\" Harry whispered to Ned, as the busy  farmer's wife actually stopped her work to see what all the excitement  was about.    The Bobbseys had come--Mr. Bobbsey and all,--and Dinah wore her best  black bonnet.    \"When will it begin?\" Flossie asked, just trembling with excitement.    \"I saw Harry and Bert go in the tent some time ago,\" whispered Nan;  \"and see, they are loosing the tent flap.\"    There was a shout of applause when Harry appeared. He actually wore a  swallowtail coat and had on a choker--a very high collar--and a bright  green tie. He wore long trousers too, and looked so queer even Aunt  Sarah had to laugh when she saw him.    \"Oh!\" exclaimed all the children when they looked inside the tent.    \"Isn't it grand!\" whispered Flossie.    Then Bert stepped up on the soap box in the middle of the ring.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he began, making a profound bow, \"ladies and  gentlemen.\"    Then everybody roared laughing.    Bert had to wait until they got through laughing at his funny costume,  which was a good deal like Harry's, only the latter wore a red tie.    In a few moments Bert went on again.    \"Ladies and gentlemen! Our first number is Frisky, the Sacred Calf of  India!\" he exclaimed, imitating that queer-voiced man called a \"Barker\"  and used at circuses.    Snap! snap! went Bert's whip, and out from a side place, back of a big  screen, came Jack Hopkins dressed like a real clown, leading our old  friend Frisky, the runaway calf.    How awfully funny it was!    The calf had over him a plush portiere that reached clear down to the  ground, and over each ear was tied a long-handled feather duster!    Such laughing and clapping as greeted this \"first number\"!    Frisky just turned around square in front and looked the people  straight in the face. This funny move made Mr. Bobbsey \"die laughing,\"  as Flossie said, and Uncle Daniel too was hilarious.    \"The sacred calf is too sacred to smile,\" laughed Uncle Daniel, while  Dinah and Martha just roared.    The children didn't think they ought to laugh out loud and spoil the  show; even Freddie raised his finger to Dinah.    Suddenly the clown jumped on the calf's back. He tried to stand on his  head. Then he turned a somersault on to the sawdust.    Everybody clapped hard now, and the children began to shout.    But Bert snapped his whip and the clown went down on his hands and  knees to apologize. Of course clowns are not supposed to speak, so Jack  did everything by pantomime.    Next he came around and kissed Frisky. This made everybody roar again,  and no matter what the clown did it certainly looked very funny.    Finally Bert snapped his whip three times, and the clown jumped on  Frisky's back, over the plush curtain and all, and rode off.    \"Wasn't that splendid!\" everybody exclaimed.    \"I really never enjoyed a big circus more than this!\" remarked Mrs.  Bobbsey to Mrs. Burns. The others all said nice things too; and then  Bert announced the next turn.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he began again, \"our next number will introduce  to you the famous wildcats, Snoop and Fluffy. Real wildcats from the  jungle, and this is the first--time--they--have ever been exhibited  in--this country!\"    Snap went the whip, and out came Harry with our little kitten friends  one on each arm.    He whistled, and Snoop climbed on his shoulder!    He whistled again, and Fluffy climbed on the other shoulder.    This \"brought the house down,\" as Uncle Daniel said, and there was so  much noise the kittens looked frightened.    Next Harry stretched out both arms straight and the kittens carefully  walked over into his hands.    \"Well, I declare!\" exclaimed Dinah. \"Jest see dat Snoopy kitty-cat! If  he can't do real reg'lar circus tricks! And jest to think how he cut up  on de cars! 'Pears like as if he was doin' it fer jokes den too!\"    \"And look at Fluffy!\" exclaimed Martha; \"as white as Snoop is black!\"  Harry stooped down and let the kittens jump through his hands, which is  an old but none the less a very pretty trick.    With the air of a real master, Bert snapped his whip and placed on the  table a little piece of board. He rubbed something on each end (it was  a bit of dried herring, but the people didn't know that), then Harry  put Snoop on one end and Fluffy on the other.    \"Oh, a teeter-tauter!\" called Freddie, unable to restrain his joy any  longer. \"I bet on Snoop. He's the heaviest.\"    At the sound of Freddie's voice Snoop turned around and the move sent  Fluffy up the air.    \"Oh! oh! oh!\" came a chorus from the children, but before anybody in  the circus had time to interfere off went Fluffy, as hard as she could  run, over the lots, home.    The next minute Snoop was after her, and Harry stood alone in the ring  bowing to the \"tremendous applause.\"    When the laughing had ceased Bert made the next announcement.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"we will now introduce our famous  menagerie. First we have the singing mice.\"    \"They're mine!\" called Freddie, but Nan insisted on him keeping quiet.    \"Now you will hear the mice sing,\" said Bert, and as he held up the  cage of little mice somebody whistled a funny tune back of the scenes.    \"Good! good!\" called Mr. Bobbsey. \"We've got real talent here,\" he  added, for indeed the boys had put together a fine show.    \"Now you see our aquarium,\" went on Bert as Harry helped him bring  forward the table that held the glass tank.    \"Here we have a real sea serpent,\" he said, pointing to a good fat chub  that flopped around in the water.    \"Let the little ones walk right up and see them,\" Bert said. \"Form in  line and pass in this way.\"    Not only the children went up, but grown folks too, for they wanted a  look into the tank.    \"Now here are our alligators and crocodiles,\" announced Bert, pointing  his whip at the turtles.    \"And these are sea-lions,\" he said, pointing out Freddie's hop-toads.    At each announcement everybody laughed, but Bert went on as seriously  as if he were deaf.    \"In this separate tank,\" he declared, \"we have our boa-constrictors,  the largest and fiercest in the world. This is the first time one of  this specimen has ever been captured alive. Note the dangerous stripe  on his back!\"    It was Jack's snakes that came in for this description, and the girls  were quite afraid of them, although they were in a glass jar.    \"Well, I declare!\" said Mrs. Burns. \"If this isn't a sure-enough  circus. I often paid a half-dollar when I went to see things no better  than these!\"    Everybody thought everything was splendid, and the boys were well paid  for their efforts.    \"Now,\" said Bert, \"here are our crystal fish from the deep sea!\" (These  were Tom's goldfish.) \"You will notice how bespangled they are. They  say this comes from the fish eating the diamonds lost in shipwrecks.\"    \"What a whopper!\" called someone back of the scenes whose voice sounded  like Tom Mason's.    Snap! went Bert's whip, and the boys did not interrupt him again.    \"The last part of our menagerie is the cage of prize butterflies,\" said  Bert. \"These butterflies are rare and scarce and--\"    \"Hard to catch!\" remarked someone not on the programme.    \"Now there will be ten minutes' intermission,\" the announcer said, \"so  all may have time to see everything in the menagerie.    \"After that we will give you the best number of the programme, our  chariot race.\"    \"Oh, that's going to be Tom!\" exclaimed Roy.    \"No, it's Bert,\" said Flossie.    \"Well, Jack has our goat-wagon,\" said Mildred.    \"I guess there'll be a whole lot in the race,\" said Freddie, \"and maybe  they'll have firemen.\"    During the intermission August sold a whole big basket of peanuts, and  the people wanted more. They knew all the money was to go to the  fresh-air camp, which was probably the reason they bought so generously.    \"I don't know when I have enjoyed myself so much,\" declared Mrs.  Manners, fanning herself. \"I had no idea boys could be so clever.\"    \"That's because you only have girls,\" laughed Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"Don't you think we ought to give them a treat for working so hard?\"  whispered Mrs. Herold to Aunt Sarah. \"I would be delighted to have them  all to dinner,\" she added, in her society way, for the Herolds were  quite rich.    \"That would be very nice, I'm sure,\" Aunt Sarah replied; \"boys always  have good appetites after having a lot of fun.\"    All this time there was plenty of noise back of the scenes, and it was  evident something big was being prepared.    Presently Bert and Harry came out and lowered the tent flap, first  making sure all the little sightseers were outside.    \"They're comin'!\" exclaimed Freddie, clapping his fat hands.    \"Oh, I'm just so nervous!\" whispered Flossie! \"I hope none of the  animals will get loose.\"    \"Now, ladies and gentlemen,\" called Tom Mason, appearing at the tent,  \"if you will just turn round the other way in your seats and face that  ring we will give you an exhibition of cowboy life on the plains!\"        CHAPTER XV    THE CHARIOT RACE    Tom's costume was a splendid imitation of a cowboy. He wore tan-colored  overalls and a jumper, the jumper being slashed up at the sides like an  Indian's coat. On his head was a very broad sombrero, this hat having  really come from the plains, as it belonged to a Western farmer who had  lately moved to Meadow Brook.    Presently Tom appeared again, this time riding the fiery Sable.    \"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted the boys, as Tom drove into the ring like a  major.    Bert now stepped into the middle of the ring alongside of some soap  boxes that were piled up there.    \"Now you see ladies and gentlemen,\" began Bert, laughing a little at  the show in broad"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#13)"],[1," was opposed to it, and was  supported by the entire Free-trade sentiment, whether North or South.    As the campaign progressed, it became evident that Clay would be  elected.  Then occurred some of those fatalities which have more than  once, in the history of Presidential campaigns, overturned the most  reasonable expectations and defeated the popular will.  Mr. Clay  committed a blunder and Mr. Polk an equivocation--to use the mildest  possible term.  Mr. Clay was induced by Southern friends to write a  letter--[Published in the North Alabamian, Aug.  16, 1844.]--in which,  after stating that \"far from having any personal objection to the  annexation of Texas, I should be glad to see it--without dishonor,  without War, with the common consent of the Union, and upon just and  fair terms,\" he added: \"I do not think that the subject of Slavery ought  to affect the question, one way or the other.\"  Mr. Polk, on the other  hand, wrote a letter in which he declared it to be \"the duty of the  Government to extend, as far as it may be practicable to do so, by its  revenue laws and all other means within its power, fair and just  Protection to all the great interests of the whole Union, embracing  Agriculture, Manufactures, the Mechanic Arts, Commerce and Navigation.\"  This was supplemented by a letter (August 8, 1844) from Judge Wilson  McCandless of Pennsylvania, strongly upholding the Protective principle,  claiming that Clay in his Compromise Tariff Bill had abandoned it, and  that Polk and Dallas had \"at heart the true interests of Pennsylvania.\"  Clay, thus betrayed by the treachery of Southern friends, was greatly  weakened, while Polk, by his beguiling letter, backed by the false  interpretation put upon it by powerful friends in the North, made the  North believe him a better Protectionist than Clay.    Polk was elected, and rewarded the misplaced confidence by making Robert  J.  Walker his Secretary of the Treasury, and, largely through that  great Free Trader's exertions, secured a repeal by Congress of the  Protective Tariff of 1842 and the enactment of the ruinous Free Trade  Tariff of 1846.  Had Clay carried New York, his election was secure.  As  it happened, Polk had a plurality in New York of but 5,106 in an immense  vote, and that slim plurality was given to him by the Abolitionists  throwing away some 15,000 on Birney.  And thus also it curiously  happened that it was the Abolition vote which secured the election of  the candidate who favored immediate annexation and the extension of the  Slave Power!    Emboldened and apparently sustained by the result of the election, the  Slave Power could not await the inauguration of Mr. Polk, but proceeded  at once, under whip and spur, to drive the Texas annexation scheme  through Congress; and two days before the 4th of March, 1845, an Act  consenting to the admission of the Republic of Texas as a State of the  Union was approved by President Tyler.    In that Act it was provided that \"New States of convenient size, not  exceeding four in number, in addition to the said State of Texas, and  having sufficient population, may hereafter, by the consent of said  State, be formed out of the territory thereof, which shall be entitled  to admission under the provisions of the Federal Constitution; and such  States as may be formed out of that portion of said territory lying  south of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, commonly  known as the Missouri Compromise line, shall be admitted into the Union  with or without Slavery, as the people of each State asking admission  may desire.  And in such State or States as shall be formed out of said  territory north of said Missouri Compromise line, Slavery or involuntary  servitude (except for crime) shall be prohibited.\"  As has been lucidly  stated by another,--[Greeley's History]--\"while seeming to curtail and  circumscribe Slavery north of the above parallel (that of 36  30' north  latitude), this measure really extended it northward to that parallel,  which it had not yet approached, under the flag of Texas, within  hundreds of miles.  But the chief end of this sham Compromise was the  involving of Congress in an indirect indorsement of the claim of Texas  to the entire left bank of the Rio Grande, from its mouth to its source;  and this was effected.\"    Texas quickly consented to the Act of annexation, and in December, 1845,  a Joint Resolution formally admitting her as a State of the Union,  reported by Stephen A.  Douglas, was duly passed.    In May, 1846, the American forces under General Taylor, which had been  dispatched to protect Texas from threatened assault, were attacked by  the Mexican army, which at Palo Alto was badly defeated and at Resaca de  la Palma driven back across the Rio Grande.    Congress immediately declared that by this invasion a state of War  existed between Mexico and the United States.  Thus commenced the War  with Mexico--destined to end in the triumph of the American Army, and  the acquisition of large areas of territory to the United States.  In  anticipation of such triumph, President Polk lost little time in asking  an appropriation of over two million dollars by Congress to facilitate  negotiations for peace with, and territorial cession from, Mexico.  And  a Bill making such appropriation was quickly passed by the House of  Representatives--but with the following significant proviso attached,  which had been offered by Mr. Wilmot: \"Provided.  That as an express and  fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory from the  Republic of Mexico by the United States, by virtue of any treaty that  may be negotiated between them, and to the use by the Executive of the  moneys herein appropriated, neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude  shall ever exist in any part of said territory, except for crime,  whereof the party shall first be duly convicted.\"    The debate in the Senate upon the Wilmot proviso, which immediately  ensued, was cut short by the expiration of the Session of Congress--and  the Bill accordingly failed of passage.    In February, 1848, the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was made between  Mexico and the United States, and Peace reigned once more.  About the  same time a Bill was passed by the Senate providing Territorial  Governments for Oregon, California and New Mexico, which provided for  the reference of all questions touching Slavery in such Territories to  the United States Supreme Court, for arbitration.  The Bill, however,  failed in the House.  The ensuing Presidential campaign resulted in the  election of General Taylor, the Whig candidate, who was succeeded upon  his death, July 10, 1850, by Fillmore.  Meanwhile, on the Oregon  Territory Bill, in 1848, a strong effort had been made by Mr. Douglas  and others to incorporate a provision extending to the Pacific Ocean the  Missouri Compromise line of 36  30' of north latitude and extending to  all future organizations of Territories of the United States the  principles of said Compromise.  This provision was adopted by the  Senate, but the House struck it from the Bill; the Senate receded, and  Oregon was admitted as a Free Territory.  But the conflict in Congress  between those who would extend and those who would restrict Slavery  still continued, and indeed gathered vehemence with time.  In 1850,  California was clamoring for admission as a Free State to the Union, and  New Mexico and Utah sought to be organized under Territorial  Governments.    In the heated discussions upon questions growing out of bills for these  purposes, and to rectify the boundaries of Texas, it was no easy matter  to reach an agreement of any sort.  Finally, however, the Compromise of  1850, offered by Mr. Clay, was practically agreed to and carried out,  and under it: California was admitted as a Free State; New Mexico and  Utah were admitted to Territorial organization without a word pro or con  on the subject of Slavery; the State of Texas was awarded a pecuniary  compensation for the rectification of her boundaries; the Slave Trade in  the District of Columbia was abolished; and a more effectual Fugitive  Slave Act passed.    By both North and South, this Compromise of 1850, and the measures  growing out of it, were very generally acquiesced in, and for a while it  seemed as though a permanent settlement of the Slavery question had been  reached.  But in the Fugitive Slave law, thus hastily enacted, lay  embedded the seed for further differences and excitements, speedily to  germinate.  In its operation it proved not only unnecessarily cruel and  harsh, in the manner of the return to bondage of escaped slaves, but  also afforded a shield and support to the kidnapping of Free Negroes  from Northern States.  The frequency of arrests in the Northern States,  and the accompanying circumstances of cruelty and brutality in the  execution of the law, soon made it especially odious throughout the  North, and created an active feeling of commiseration for the unhappy  victims of the Slave Power, which greatly intensified and increased the  growing Anti-Slavery sentiment in the Free States.    In 1852-53, an attempt was made in Congress to organize into the  Territory of Nebraska, the region of country lying west of Iowa and  Missouri.  Owing to the opposition of the South the Bill was defeated.  In 1853-4 a similar Bill was reported to the Senate by Mr. Douglas, but  afterward at his own instance recommitted to the Committee on  Territories, and reported back by him again in such shape as to create,  instead of one, two Territories, that portion directly west of Missouri  to be called Kansas, and the balance to be known as Nebraska--one of the  sections of the Bill enacting:    \"That in order to avoid all misconstruction it is hereby declared to be  the true intent and meaning of this Act, so far as the question of  Slavery is concerned, to carry into practical operation the following  propositions and"]]]
