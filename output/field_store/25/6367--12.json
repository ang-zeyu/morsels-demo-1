(The capital letters designate the pairs of antitheses.)        It is clear that all I have said of these simple colours is very  provisional and general, and so also are those feelings (joy,  grief, etc.) which have been quoted as parallels of the colours.  For these feelings are only the material expressions of the soul.  Shades of colour, like those of sound, are of a much finer  texture and awake in the soul emotions too fine to be expressed  in words. Certainly each tone will find some probable expression  in words, but it will always be incomplete, and that part which  the word fails to express will not be unimportant but rather the  very kernel of its existence. For this reason words are, and will  always remain, only hints, mere suggestions of colours. In this  impossibility of expressing colour in words with the consequent  need for some other mode of expression lies the opportunity of  the art of the future. In this art among innumerable rich and  varied combinations there is one which is founded on firm fact,  and that is as follows. The actual expression of colour can be  achieved simultaneously by several forms of art, each art playing  its separate part, and producing a whole which exceeds in  richness and force any expression attainable by one art alone.  The immense possibilities of depth and strength to be gained by  combination or by discord between the various arts can be easily  realized.    It is often said that admission of the possibility of one art  helping another amounts to a denial of the necessary differences  between the arts. This is, however, not the case. As has been  said, an absolutely similar inner appeal cannot be achieved by  two different arts. Even if it were possible the second version  would differ at least outwardly. But suppose this were not the  case, that is to say, suppose a repetition of the same appeal  exactly alike both outwardly and inwardly could be achieved by  different arts, such repetition would not be merely superfluous.  To begin with, different people find sympathy in different forms  of art (alike on the active and passive side among the creators  or the receivers of the appeal); but further and more important,  repetition of the same appeal thickens the spiritual atmosphere  which is necessary for the maturing of the finest feelings, in  the same way as the hot air of a greenhouse is necessary for the  ripening of certain fruit. An example of this is the case of the  individual who receives a powerful impression from constantly  repeated actions, thoughts or feelings, although if they came  singly they might have passed by unnoticed. [Footnote: This idea  forms, of course, the fundamental reason for advertisement.] We  must not, however, apply this rule only to the simple examples of  the spiritual atmosphere. For this atmosphere is like air, which  can be either pure or filled with various alien elements. Not  only visible actions, thoughts and feelings, with outward  expression, make up this atmosphere, but secret happenings of  which no one knows, unspoken thoughts, hidden feelings are also  elements in it. Suicide, murder, violence, low and unworthy  thoughts, hate, hostility, egotism, envy, narrow \"patriotism,\"  partisanship, are elements in the spiritual atmosphere.    [Footnote: Epidemics of suicide or of violent warlike feeling,  etc., are products of this impure atmosphere.]    And conversely, self-sacrifice, mutual help, lofty thoughts,  love, un-selfishness, joy in the success of others, humanity,  justness, are the elements which slay those already enumerated as  the sun slays the microbes, and restore the atmosphere to purity.    [Footnote: These elements likewise have their historical  periods.]    The second and more complicated form of repetition is that in  which several different elements make mutual use of different  forms. In our case these elements are the different arts summed  up in the art of the future. And this form of repetition is even  more powerful, for the different natures of men respond to the  different elements in the combination. For one the musical form  is the most moving and impressive; for another the pictorial, for  the third the literary, and so on. There reside, therefore, in  arts which are outwardly different, hidden forces equally  different, so that they may all work in one man towards a single  result, even though each art may be working in isolation.    This sharply defined working of individual colours is the basis  on which various values can be built up in harmony. Pictures will  come to be painted--veritable artistic arrangements, planned in  shades of one colour chosen according to artistic feeling. The  carrying out of one colour, the binding together and admixture of  two related colours, are the foundations of most coloured  harmonies. From what has been said above about colour working,  from the fact that we live in a time of questioning, experiment  and contradiction, we can draw the easy conclusion that for a  harmonization on the basis of individual colours our age is  especially unsuitable. Perhaps with envy and with a mournful  sympathy we listen to the music of Mozart. It acts as a welcome  pause in the turmoil of our inner life, as a consolation and as a  hope, but we hear it as the echo of something from another age  long past and fundamentally strange to us. The strife of colours,  the sense of balance we have lost, tottering principles,  unexpected assaults, great questions, apparently useless  striving, storm and tempest, broken chains, antitheses and  contradictions, these make up our harmony. The composition  arising from this harmony is a mingling of colour and form each  with its separate existence, but each blended into a common life  which is called a picture by the force of the inner need. Only  these individual parts are vital. Everything else (such as  surrounding conditions) is subsidiary. The combination of two  colours is a logical outcome of modern conditions. The  combination of colours hitherto considered discordant, is merely  a further development. For example, the use, side by side, of red  and blue, colours in themselves of no physical relationship, but  from their very spiritual contrast of the strongest effect, is  one of the most frequent occurrences in modern choice of harmony.  [Footnote: Cf. Gauguin, Noa Noa, where the artist states his  disinclination when he first arrived in Tahiti to juxtapose red  and blue.] Harmony today rests chiefly on the principle of  contrast which has for all time been one of the most important  principles of art. But our contrast is an inner contrast which  stands alone and rejects the help (for that help would mean  destruction) of any other principles of harmony. It is  interesting to note that this very placing together of red and  blue was so beloved by the primitive both in Germany and Italy  that it has till today survived, principally in folk pictures of  religious subjects. One often sees in such pictures the Virgin in  a red gown and a blue cloak. It seems that the artists wished to  express the grace of heaven in terms of humanity, and humanity in  terms of heaven. Legitimate and illegitimate combinations of  colours, contrasts of various colours, the over-painting of one  colour with another, the definition of coloured surfaces by  boundaries of various forms, the overstepping of these  boundaries, the mingling and the sharp separation of surfaces,  all these open great vistas of artistic possibility.    One of the first steps in the turning away from material objects  into the realm of the abstract was, to use the technical artistic  term, the rejection of the third dimension, that is to say, the  attempt to keep a picture on a single plane. Modelling was  abandoned. In this way the material object was made more abstract  and an important step forward was achieved--this step forward  has, however, had the effect of limiting the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/533"],[0,"The Song of the Cardinal (#13)"],[1,"d.    As his gun was at the sportman's shoulder, and he was still peering  among the bushes, denial seemed useless.  \"Yes, I did,\" he replied, and  made a pretense of turning to the sumac again.    There was a forward impulse of Abram's body.  \"Hit 'im?\" he demanded  with awful calm.    \"Thought I had, but I guess I only winged him.\"    Abram's fingers closed around his club.  At the sound of his friend's  voice, the Cardinal came darting through the bushes a wavering flame,  and swept so closely to him for protection that a wing almost brushed  his cheek.    \"See here! See here!\" shrilled the bird in deadly panic.  There was not  a cut feather on him.    Abram's relief was so great he seemed to shrink an inch in height.    \"Young man, you better thank your God you missed that bird,\" he said  solemnly, \"for if you'd killed him, I'd a-mauled this stick to ribbons  on you, an' I'm most afraid I wouldn't a-knowed when to quit.\"    He advanced a step in his eagerness, and the hunter, mistaking his  motive, levelled his gun.    \"Drop that!\" shouted Abram, as he broke through the bushes that clung  to him, tore the clothing from his shoulders, and held him back.  \"Drop  that!  Don't you dare point a weapon at me; on my own premises, an'  after you passed your word.    \"Your word!\" repeated Abram, with withering scorn, his white, quivering  old face terrible to see.  \"Young man, I got a couple o' things to say  to you.  You'r' shaped like a man, an' you'r' dressed like a man, an'  yet the smartest person livin' would never take you for anything but an  egg-suckin' dog, this minute.  All the time God ever spent on you was  wasted, an' your mother's had the same luck.  I s'pose God's used to  having creatures 'at He's made go wrong, but I pity your mother.  Goodness knows a woman suffers an' works enough over her children, an'  then to fetch a boy to man's estate an' have him, of his own free will  an' accord, be a liar!  Young man, truth is the cornerstone o' the  temple o' character.  Nobody can put up a good buildin' without a solid  foundation; an' you can't do solid character buildin' with a lie at the  base.  Man 'at's a liar ain't fit for anything!  Can't trust him in no  sphere or relation o' life; or in any way, shape, or manner.  You  passed out your word like a man, an' like a man I took it an' went off  trustin' you, an' you failed me.  Like as not that squirrel story was a  lie, too!  Have you got a sick friend who is needin' squirrel broth?\"    The hunter shook his head.    \"No?  That wasn't true either?  I'll own you make me curious.  'Ud you  mind tellin' me what was your idy in cookin' up that squirrel story?\"    The hunter spoke with an effort.  \"I suppose I wanted to do something  to make you feel small,\" he admitted, in a husky voice.    \"You wanted to make me feel small,\" repeated Abram, wonderingly.  \"Lord!  Lord!  Young man, did you ever hear o' a boomerang?  It's a  kind o' weapon used in Borneo, er Australy, er some o' them furrin  parts, an' it's so made 'at the heathens can pitch it, an' it cuts a  circle an' comes back to the fellow, at throwed.  I can't see myself,  an' I don't know how small I'm lookin'; but I'd rather lose ten year o'  my life 'an to have anybody catch me lookin' as little as you do right  now.  I guess we look about the way we feel in this world.  I'm feelin'  near the size o' Goliath at present; but your size is such 'at it  hustles me to see any MAN in you at all.  An' you wanted to make me  feel small!  My, oh, my!  An' you so young yet, too!    \"An' if it hadn't a-compassed a matter o' breakin' your word, what 'ud  you want to kill the redbird for, anyhow? Who give you rights to go  'round takin' such beauty an' joy out of the world?  Who do you think  made this world an' the things 'at's in it?  Maybe it's your notion 'at  somebody about your size whittled it from a block o' wood, scattered a  little sand for earth, stuck a few seeds for trees, an' started the  oceans with a waterin' pot!  I don't know what paved streets an' stall  feedin' do for a man, but any one 'at's lived sixty year on the ground  knows 'at this whole old earth is jest teemin' with work 'at's too big  for anything but a God, an' a mighty BIG God at that!    \"You don't never need bother none 'bout the diskivries o' science, for  if science could prove 'at the earth was a red hot slag broken from the  sun, 'at balled an' cooled flyin' through space until the force o'  gravity caught an' held it, it doesn't prove what the sun broke from,  or why it balled an' didn't cool.  Sky over your head, earth under  foot, trees around you, an' river there--all full o' life 'at you ain't  no mortal right to touch, 'cos God made it, an' it's His!  Course, I  know 'at He said distinct 'at man was to have `dominion over the beasts  o' the field, an' the fowls o' the air' An' that means 'at you're free  to smash a copperhead instead of letting it sting you.  Means 'at you  better shoot a wolf than to let it carry off your lambs.  Means, at  it's right to kill a hawk an' save your chickens; but God knows 'at  shootin' a redbird just to see the feathers fly isn't having dominion  over anything; it's jest makin' a plumb beast o' YERSELF.  Passes me,  how you can face up to the Almighty, an' draw a bead on a thing like  that! Takes more gall'n I got!    \"God never made anything prettier 'an that bird, an' He must a-been  mighty proud o' the job.  Jest cast your eyes on it there!

Went South for winter, an' made  friends 'at's been feedin', an' teachin' it to TRUST mankind.  Back  this spring in a night, an' struck that sumac over a month ago.  Broke  me all up first time I ever set eyes on it.    \"Biggest reddest redbird I ever saw; an' jest a master hand at king's  English!  Talk plain as you can!  Don't know what he said down South,  but you can bank on it, it was sumpin' pretty fine.  When he settled  here, he was discoursin' on the weather, an' he talked it out about  proper.  He'd say, `Wet year! Wet year!' jest like that!  He got the  `wet' jest as good as I can, an', if he drawed the `ye-ar' out a  little, still any blockhead could a-told what he was sayin', an' in a  voice pretty an' clear as a bell.  Then he got love-sick, an' begged  for comp'ny until he broke me all up.  An' if I'd a-been a hen redbird  I wouldn't a-been so long comin'.  Had me pulverized in less'n no time!  Then a little hen comes 'long, an' stops with him; an' 'twas like an  organ playin' prayers to hear him tell her how he loved her. Now  they've got a nest full o' the cunningest little topknot babies, an'  he's splittin' the echoes, calling for the whole neighbourhood to come  see 'em, he's so mortal proud.    \"Stake my life he's never been fired on afore!  He's pretty near wild  with narvousness, but he's got too much spunk to leave his fam'ly, an'  go off an' hide from creatures like you.  They's no caution in him.  Look at him tearin' 'round to give you another chance!    \"I felt most too rheumaticky to tackle field work this spring until he  come 'long, an' the fire o' his coat an' song got me warmed up as I  ain't been in years.  Work's gone like it was greased, an' my soul's  been singin' for joy o' life an' happiness ev'ry minute o' the time  since he come.  Been carryin' him grub to that top rail once an' twice  a day for the last month, an' I can go in three feet o' him.  My wife  comes to see him, an' brings him stuff; an' we about worship him.  Who  are you, to come 'long an' wipe out his joy in life, an' our joy in  him, for jest nothin'? You'd a left him to rot on the ground, if you'd  a hit him; an' me an' Maria's loved him so!    \"D'you ever stop to think how full this world is o' things to love, if  your heart's jest big enough to let 'em in?  We love to live for the  beauty o' the things surroundin' us, an' the joy we take in bein' among  'em.  An' it's my belief 'at the way to make folks love us, is for us  to be able to 'preciate what they can do.  If a man's puttin' his heart  an' soul, an' blood, an' beef-steak, an' bones into paintin' picters,  you can talk farmin' to him all day, an' he's dumb; but jest show him  'at you see what he's a-drivin' at in his work, an' he'll love you like  a brother.  Whatever anybody succeeds in, it's success 'cos they so  love it 'at they put the best o' theirselves into it; an' so, lovin'  what they do, is lovin' them.    \"It 'ud 'bout kill a painter-man to put the best o' himself into his  picture, an' then have some fellow like you come 'long an' pour  turpentine on it jest to see the paint run; an' I think it must pretty  well use God up, to figure out how to make an' colour a thing like that  bird, an' then have you walk up an' shoot the little red heart out of  it, jest to prove 'at you can! He's the very life o' this river bank.  I'd as soon see you dig up the underbrush, an' dry up the river, an'  spoil the picture they make against the sky, as to hev' you drop the  redbird.  He's the red life o' the whole thing!  God must a-made him  when his heart was pulsin' hot with love an' the lust o' creatin'  in-com-PAR-able things; an' He jest saw how pretty it 'ud be to dip his  featherin' into the blood He was puttin' in his veins.    \"To my mind, ain't no better way to love an' worship God, 'an to  protect an' 'preciate these fine gifts He's given for our joy an' use.  Worshipin' that bird's a kind o' religion with me.  Getting the beauty  from the sky, an' the trees, an' the grass, an' the water 'at God made,  is nothin' but doin' Him homage.  Whole earth's a sanctuary.  You can  worship from sky above to grass under foot.    \"Course, each man has his particular altar.  Mine's in that cabin up at  the bend o' the river.  Maria lives there.  God never did cleaner work,  'an when He made Maria."]]]
