Selah.    19:068:020 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the             Lord belong the issues from death.    19:068:021 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy             scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.    19:068:022 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my             people again from the depths of the sea:    19:068:023 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and             the tongue of thy dogs in the same.    19:068:024 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God,             my King, in the sanctuary.    19:068:025 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed             after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.    19:068:026 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the             fountain of Israel.    19:068:027 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of             Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the             princes of Naphtali.    19:068:028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that             which thou hast wrought for us.    19:068:029 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents             unto thee.    19:068:030 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls,             with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself             with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in             war.    19:068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch             out her hands unto God.    19:068:032 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto             the Lord; Selah:    19:068:033 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of             old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.    19:068:034 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel,             and his strength is in the clouds.    19:068:035 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of             Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.             Blessed be God.    19:069:001 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.    19:069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come             into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.    19:069:003 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail             while I wait for my God.    19:069:004 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of             mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies             wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not             away.    19:069:005 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid             from thee.    19:069:006 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be             ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be             confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.    19:069:007 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered             my face.    19:069:008 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my             mother's children.    19:069:009 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the             reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.    19:069:010 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to             my reproach.    19:069:011 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to             them.    19:069:012 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song             of the drunkards.    19:069:013 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an             acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me,             in the truth of thy salvation.    19:069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be             delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.    19:069:015 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep             swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.    19:069:016 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me             according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.    19:069:017 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:             hear me speedily.    19:069:018 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of             mine enemies.    19:069:019 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:             mine adversaries are all before thee.    19:069:020 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and             I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for             comforters, but I found none.    19:069:021 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave             me vinegar to drink.    19:069:022 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which             should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.    19:069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their             loins continually to shake.    19:069:024 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful             anger take hold of them.    19:069:025 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their             tents.    19:069:026 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk             to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.    19:069:027 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into             thy righteousness.    19:069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be             written with the righteous.    19:069:029 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me             up on high.    19:069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify             him with thanksgiving.    19:069:031 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock             that hath horns and hoofs.    19:069:032 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall             live that seek God.    19:069:033 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his             prisoners.    19:069:034 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing             that moveth therein.    19:069:035 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah:             that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.    19:069:036 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that             love his name shall dwell therein.    19:070:001 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O             LORD.    19:070:002 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul:             let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire             my hurt.    19:070:003 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,             Aha, aha.    19:070:004 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and             let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be             magnified.    19:070:005 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art             my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.    19:071:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to             confusion.    19:071:002 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape:             incline thine ear unto me, and save me.    19:071:003 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually             resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art             my rock and my fortress.    19:071:004 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of             the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.    19:071:005 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my             youth.    19:071:006 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that             took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],[0,"The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#13)"],[1," idea.          ERN.  (asidedelighted).  I scarcely dared even to hope    for    this!          JULIA.  Of course, as your leading lady, you'll be mean    enough to hold me to the terms of my agreement.  Oh, that's so    like a man!  Well, I suppose there's no help for itI shall have    to do it!          ERN. (aside). She's mine!  (Aloud.)  Butdo you really    think you would care to play that part?  (Taking her hand.)          JULIA (withdrawing it).  Care to play it?  Certainly    notbut what am I to do?  Business is business, and I am bound    by the terms of my agreement.          ERN.  It's for a long run, minda run that may last many,    many yearsno understudyand once embarked upon there's no    throwing it up.          JULIA.  Oh, we're used to these long runs in England: they    are the curse of the stagebut, you see, I've no option.          ERN.  You think the part of Grand Duchess will be good    enough for you?          JULIA.  Oh, I think so.  It's a very good part in    Gerolstein, and oughtn't to be a bad one in Pfennig Halbpfennig.    Why, what did you suppose I was going to play?          ERN. (keeping up a show of reluctance)  But, considering    your strong personal dislike to me and your persistent rejection    of my repeated offers, won't you find it difficult to throw    yourself into the part with all the impassioned enthusiasm that    the character seems to demand?  Remember, it's a strongly    emotional part, involving long and repeated scenes of rapture,    tenderness, adoration, devotionall in luxuriant excess, and all    of the most demonstrative description.          JULIA.  My good sir, throughout my career I have made it a    rule never to allow private feeling to interfere with my    professional duties.  You may be quite sure that (however    distasteful the part may be) if I undertake it, I shall consider    myself professionally bound to throw myself into it with all the    ardour at my command.          ERN. (asidewith effusion).  I'm the happiest fellow    alive!    (Aloud.)  Nowwould you have any objectiontoto give me some    ideaif it's only a mere sketchas to how you would play it?    It would be really interestingto meto know your conception    ofofthe part of my wife.          JULIA.  How would I play it?  Now, let me seelet me see.    (Considering.)  Ah, I have it!                              BALLADJULIA.                  How would I play this part                            The Grand Duke's Bride?                All rancour in my heart                            I'd duly hide                      I'd drive it from my recollection                      And 'whelm you with a mock affection,                      Well calculated to defy detection                That's how I'd play this part                            The Grand Duke's Bride.                  With many a winsome smile                            I'd witch and woo;                With gay and girlish guile                            I'd frenzy you                      I'd madden you with my caressing,                      Like turtle, her first love confessing                      That it was \"mock\", no mortal would be    guessing,                With so much winsome wile                            I'd witch and woo!                  Did any other maid                            With you succeed,                I'd pinch the forward jade                            I would indeed!                      With jealous frenzy agitated                      (Which would, of course, be simulated),                      I'd make her wish she'd never been created                Did any other maid                            With you succeed!                  And should there come to me,                            Some summers hence,                In all the childish glee                            Of innocence,                      Fair babes, aglow with beauty vernal,                      My heart would bound with joy diurnal!                      This sweet display of sympathy maternal,                Well, that would also be                            A mere pretence!                  My histrionic art                            Though you deride,                That's how I'd play that part                            The Grand Duke's Bride!

It's all your fault, you booby youyou lump of                indiscrimination!          I'm sure I don't know where to goit's put me into such a                tetter          But this at all events I knowthe sooner we are off, the                better!      ERN.  What means this agitato?  What d'ye seek?          As your Grand Duke elect I bid you speak!                            SONGLUDWIG.            Ten minutes since I met a chap                Who bowed an easy salutation          Thinks I, \"This gentleman, mayhap,                Belongs to our Association.\"                      But, on the whole,                            Uncertain yet,                      A sausage-roll                            I took and eat          That chap replied (I don't embellish)          By eating three with obvious relish.      CHORUS (angrily).       Why, gracious powers,                            No chum of ours                      Could eat three sausage-rolls with relish!      LUD.  Quite reassured, I let him know                Our ploteach incident explaining;          That stranger chuckled much, as though                He thought me highly entertaining.                      I told him all,                            Both bad and good;                      I bade him call                            He said he would:          I added muchthe more I muckled,          The more that chuckling chummy chuckled!      ALL (angrily).    A bat could see                      He couldn't be                A chum of ours if he chuckled!      LUD.  Well, as I bowed to his applause,                Down dropped he with hysteric bellow          And that seemed right enough, because                I am a devilish funny fellow.                      Then suddenly,                            As still he squealed,                      It flashed on me                            That I'd revealed          Our plot, with all details effective,          To Grand Duke Rudolph's own detective!      ALL.        What folly fell,                To go and tell          Our plot to any one's detective!      CHORUS.      (Attacking LUDWIG.)  You booby dense                      You oaf immense,                      With no pretence                      To common sense!                      A stupid muff                      Who's made of stuff                      Not worth a puff                      Of candle-snuff!      Pack up at once and off we go, unless we're anxious to exhibit    Our fairy forms all in a row, strung up upon the Castle gibbet!      [Exeunt Chorus. Manent LUDWIG, LISA,    ERNEST, JULIA, and NOTARY.          JULIA.  Well, a nice mess you've got us into!  There's an    end of our precious plot!  All uppopfizzlebangdone for!          LUD.  Yes, butha! ha!fancy my choosing the Grand Duke's    private detective, of all men, to make a confidant of!  When you    come to think of it, it's really devilish funny!          ERN. (angrily).  When you come to think of it, it's    extremely injudicious to admit into a conspiracy every    pudding-headed baboon who presents himself!          LUD.  YesI should never do that. If I were chairman of    this gang, I should hesitate to enrol any baboon who couldn't    produce satisfactory credentials from his last Zoological    Gardens.          LISA.  Ludwig is far from being a baboon.  Poor boy, he    could not help giving us awayit's his trusting naturehe was    deceived.          JULIA (furiously).  His trusting nature!  (To LUDWIG.)  Oh,    I should like to talk to you in my own language for five    minutesonly five minutes!  I know some good, strong, energetic    English remarks that would shrivel your trusting nature into    raisinsonly you wouldn't understand them!          LUD.  Here we perceive one of the disadvantages of a    neglected education!          ERN. (to JULIA).  And I suppose you'll never be my Grand    Duchess now!          JULIA.  Grand Duchess?  My good friend, if you don't    produce    the piece how can I play the part?          ERN.  True. (To LUDWIG.)  You see what you've done.          LUD.  But, my dear sir, you don't seem to understand that    the man ate three sausage-rolls.  Keep that fact steadily before    you.  Three large sausage-rolls.          JULIA.  Bah!Lots of people eat"]]]
