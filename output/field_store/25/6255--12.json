I am flesh and bones like you; and at  first I was a creature that God created.    7 And it was so, that when He had created me, He placed me in a garden  in the north, on the border of the world.    8 And He said to me, 'Stay here!'  And I remained there according to  His Word, neither did I transgress His commandment.    9 Then He made a slumber to come over me, and He brought you, O Adam,  out of my side, but did not make you stay with me.    10 But God took you in His divine hand, and placed you in a garden to  the eastward.    11 Then I worried about you, for that while God had taken you out of my  side, He had not let you stay with me.    12 But God said to me: 'Do not worry about Adam, whom I brought out of  your side; no harm will come to him.    13 For now I have brought out of his side a help-meet* for him; and I  have given him joy by so doing.'\"    14 Then Satan said again, \"I did not know how it is you are in this  cave, nor anything about this trial that has come over you--until God  said to me, 'Behold, Adam has transgressed, he whom I had taken out of  your side, and Eve also, whom I took out of his side; and I have driven  them out of the garden; I have made them live in a land of sorrow and  misery, because they transgressed against Me, and have obeyed Satan.  And look, they are in suffering until this day, the eightieth.'    15 Then God said to me, 'Get up, go to them, and make them come to your  place, and suffer not that Satan come near them, and afflict them.  For  they are now in great misery; and lie helpless from hunger.'    16 He further said to me, 'When you have taken them to yourself, give  them to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life, and give them to drink of  the water of peace; and clothe them in a garment of light, and restore  them to their former state of grace, and leave them not in misery, for  they came from you.  But grieve not over them, nor repent of that which  has come over them.    17 But when I heard this, I was sorry; and my heart could not patiently  bear it for your sake, O my child.    18 But, O Adam, when I heard the name of Satan, I was afraid, and I  said within myself, I will not come out because he might trap me as he  did my children, Adam and Eve.    19 And I said, 'O God, when I go to my children, Satan will meet me in  the way, and war against me, as he did against them.'    20 Then God said to me, 'Fear not; when you find him, hit him with the  staff that is in thine hand, and don't be afraid of him, for you are of  old standing, and he shall not prevail against you.'    21 Then I said, 'O my Lord, I am old, and cannot go.  Send Your angels  to bring them.'    22 But God said to me, 'Angels, verily, are not like them; and they  will not consent to come with them.  But I have chosen you, because  they are your offspring and are like you, and they will listen to what  you say.'    23 God said further to me, 'If you don't have enough strength to walk,  I will send a cloud to carry you and set you down at the entrance of  their cave; then the cloud will return and leave you there.    24 And if they will come with you, I will send a cloud to carry you and  them.'    25 Then He commanded a cloud, and it bear me up and brought me to you;  and then went back.    26 And now, O my children, Adam and Eve, look at my old gray hair and  at my feeble state, and at my coming from that distant place.  Come,  come with me, to a place of rest.\"    27 Then he began to cry and to sob before Adam and Eve, and his tears  poured on the ground like water.    28 And when Adam and Eve raised their eyes and saw his beard, and heard  his sweet talk, their hearts softened towards him; they obeyed him, for  they believed he was true.    29 And it seemed to them that they were really his offspring, when they  saw that his face was like their own; and they trusted him.      * The existence of the two words helpmeet and helpmate, meaning exactly  the same thing, is a comedy of errors.  God's promise to Adam, as  rendered in the King James version of the Bible, was to give him  an  help meet for him  (that is, a helper fit for him). In the 17th century  the two words help and meet in this passage were mistaken for one word,  applying to Eve, and thus helpmeet came to mean  a wife.  Then in the  18th century, in a misguided attempt to make sense of the word, the  spelling helpmate was introduced. Both errors are now beyond recall,  and both spellings are acceptable.          Chapter LXI - They begin to follow Satan.    1 Then he took Adam and Eve by the hand, and began to bring them out of  the cave.    2 But when they had come a little ways out of it, God knew that Satan  had overcome them, and had brought them out before the forty days were  ended, to take them to some distant place, and to destroy them.    3 Then the Word of the Lord God again came and cursed Satan, and drove  him away from them.    4 And God began to speak to Adam and Eve, saying to them, \"What made  you come out of the cave, to this place?\"    5 Then Adam said to God, \"Did you create a man before us?  For when we  were in the cave there suddenly came to us a friendly old man who said  to us, 'I am a messenger from God to you, to bring you back to some  place of rest.'    6 And we believed, O God, that he was a messenger from you; and we came  out with him; and knew not where we should go with him.\"    7 Then God said to Adam, \"See, that is the father of evil arts, who  brought you and Eve out of the Garden of Delights.  And now, indeed,  when he saw that you and Eve both joined together in fasting and  praying, and that you came not out of the cave before the end of the  forty days, he wished to make your purpose vein, to break your mutual  bond; to cut off all hope from you, and to drive you to some place  where he might destroy you.    8 Because he couldn't do anything to you unless he showed himself in  the likeness of you.    9 Therefore he came to you with a face like your own, and began to give  you tokens as if they were all true.    10 But because I am merciful and am favorable to you, I did not allow  him to destroy you; instead I drove him away from you.    11 Now, therefore, O Adam, take Eve, and return to your cave, and  remain in it until the morning after  the fortieth day.  And when you  come out, go towards the eastern gate of the garden.\"    12 Then Adam and Eve worshipped God, and praised and blessed Him for  the deliverance that had come to them from Him.  And they returned  towards the cave.  This happened in the evening of the thirty-ninth day.    13 Then Adam and Eve stood up and with a fiery passion, prayed to God,  to give them strength; for they had become weak because of  hunger and  thirst and prayer.  But they watched the whole of that night praying,  until morning.    14 Then Adam said to Eve, \"Get up, let us go towards the eastern gate  of the garden as God told us.\"    15 And they said their prayers as they were accustomed to do every day;  and they left the cave to go near to the eastern gate of the garden.    16 Then Adam and Eve stood up and prayed, and appealed to God to  strengthen them, and to send them something to satisfy their hunger.    17 But after they finished their prayers, they were too weak to move.    18 Then came the Word of God again, and said to them, \"O Adam, get up,  go and bring the two figs here.\"    19 Then Adam and Eve got up, and went until they came near to the cave.          Chapter LXII - Two fruit trees.    1 But Satan the wicked was envious, because of the consolation God had  given them.    2 So he prevented them, and went into the cave and took the two figs,  and buried them outside the cave, so that Adam and Eve should not find  them.  He also had in his thoughts to destroy them.    3 But by God's mercy, as soon as those two figs were in the ground, God  defeated Satan's counsel regarding them; and made them into two fruit  trees, that overshadowed the cave.  For Satan had buried them on the  eastern side of it.    4 Then when the two trees were grown, and were covered with fruit,  Satan grieved and mourned, and said, \"It would have been better to have  left those figs where they were; for now, behold, they have become two  fruit trees, whereof Adam will eat all the days of his life.  Whereas I  had in mind, when I buried them, to destroy them entirely, and to hide  them forever.    5 But God has overturned my counsel; and would not that this sacred  fruit should perish; and He has made plain my intention, and has  defeated the counsel I had formed against His servants.\"    6 Then Satan went away ashamed because he hadn't thought his plans all  the way through.          Chapter LXIII - The first joy of trees.    1 But Adam and Eve, as they got closer to the cave, saw two fig trees,  covered with fruit, and overshadowing the cave.    2 Then Adam said to Eve, \"It seems to me that we have gone the wrong  way.  When did these two trees grow here?  It seems to me that the  enemy wishes to lead us the wrong way.  Do you suppose that there is  another cave besides this one in the earth?    3 Yet, O Eve, let us go into the cave, and find in it the two figs; for  this is our cave, in which we were.  But if we should not find the two  figs in it, then it cannot be our cave.\"    4 They went then into the cave, and looked into the four corners of it,  but found not the two figs.    5 And Adam cried and said to Eve, \"Did we go to the wrong cave, then, O  Eve?  It seems to me these two fig trees are the two figs that were in  the cave.\"  And Eve said, \"I, for my part, do not know.\"    6 Then Adam stood up and prayed and said, \"O God, You commanded us to  come back to the cave, to take the two figs, and then to return to you.    7 But now, we have not found them.

So it fared with our two artists, who separately could  accomplish very little; though in uniting their powers they produced  paintings of considerable merit. In the _Guida di Bologna_ they are very  properly rarely divided from each other; and I believe, that in every  painting we find attributed to Aretusi, we ought farther to seek for some  companion of his labours. Of such kind is a Nativity of the Virgin at S.  Afra in Brescia, passing under his name, and painted in a very powerful  style. Respecting this picture, however, Averoldi is of opinion that it was  in part the workmanship of Bagnatore, in part of other painters, or,  perhaps, only painter; in other words that of his useful friend Aretusi.  Nevertheless in the branch of portrait, Cesare possessed merit above  sharing it with others, and in this capacity he was employed by different  princes, and he also succeeded in copying the works of excellent masters  better than any other of his age. He could assume the style of almost every  painter, and even pass off his imitations for the originals. In his  imitation of Coreggio, he was more particularly successful, and received a  commission to execute a painting from the celebrated Night, by that master,  for the church of S. Gio. di Parma, where it still remains. Mengs, who saw  it, declared that were the original at Dresden by any accident lost, it  might be well supplied by so fine a duplicate. It was this performance that  obtained him the honour of restoring the painting, formerly executed by  Coreggio for the same church, of which mention was made in the school of  Parma, and to which we here refer the reader. Here too we should add, that  such was the success of that picture, \"from its accurate imitation of the  taste displayed in the original, of its conception, and of its harmony, as  to lead those unacquainted with the fact to suppose it to be the work of  Allegri.\" Such are the words of Ruta in his _Guida_.         Footnote 16: See vol. iv. p. 43.    Little attention seems to have been given to inferior branches of the art  during this epoch, if, indeed, we except that of portrait, whose leading  artists must not again be introduced here, having treated of their merits  in the proper place. Nor probably were there then wanting painters in oil,  who severally produced ornamental pieces of landscape and animals, besides  Cremonini and Baglione, whose ability in this line we shall shortly notice,  in the class of ornamental fresco painters; though none, as far as I can  learn, acquired celebrity. In one instance only I meet with handsome  eulogiums on a miniature painter, occasionally mentioned throughout this  work. He was called Gio. Neri, also Gio. degli Ucelli, from his peculiar  talent in delineating all kinds of birds from the life. With these, and  with fish of various species, with quadrupeds and other animals, he filled  seven folio volumes, which are cited by Masini in the studio of Ulisse  Aldovrandi.    Throughout the whole of this epoch we find no mention in Malvasia of any  ornamental or perspective painters, except, perhaps, some figurist, who  paid little attention to decorations. There is reason, however, to suppose  that the celebrated Sebastiano Serlio, while yet a youth, painted  perspectives. The Cav. Tiraboschi, in the seventh volume of his history,  remarks that \"there is no account of Serlio's occupation during the early  part of his life.\" But the _Guida_ of Pesaro, p. 83, alludes to him at the  close of 1511, and subsequently in 1514, as residing in that city in  quality of an artist; and in what branch can we more probably suppose him  to have been engaged than in perspective? For this, indeed, was the  tirocinium of other able architects, where, previous to being entrusted  with the anxious duties of their profession, they were enabled, with more  facility, to sustain themselves, until their reputation permitted them to  assume the character of architects, and abandon the pursuit of painting.  Indisputably he could not have been an architect at Pesaro, otherwise there  would never have been written on a parchment of 1514, remaining in the  archives of the Servi:--_Sebastiano qu. Bartholomaei de Serlis de Bononia  pictore habitatore Pisauri_. And it is about 1534 that we have an account  of his being at Venice, no longer handling the pencil, but the square.  Masini, who had written his _Bologna Perlustrata_ only a short period  before the _Felsina Pittrice_, commends an Agostino dalle Prospettive, who  had reached such a degree of perfection in that art, as even to deceive  animals and men with his illusive staircases and similar works, executed at  Bologna. It is doubtful whether he did not belong to another school, and  may have been omitted by Malvasia as a foreigner. I suspected him to be a  Milanese in my fourth volume (p. 231), and pupil to the great Soardi, not  inferior to his master. Next to him, and to Laureti, Gio. Batista Cremonini  of Cento was employed in such commissions more than any other artist. He  had received rather superior instructions in the rules of perspective, and  respectable practice in the line of statues, figures, and histories, with  whatever went to give splendour and effect to a facade, a theatre, or a  hall; more particularly he succeeded in delineating animals, however  ferocious and wild. There was scarcely a house of any account in all  Bologna, which, if nothing more, could not boast some specimen of his  chiaroscuro, some frieze for ornament, chimney-piece, or vestibule,  decorated by Cremonini; to say nothing of his numerous works in fresco  which filled the churches. He was also employed for the adjacent cities,  and in different courts of Lombardy kept open school and instructed  Guercino, Savonanzi, Fialetti, who flourished in Venice as before stated.  He had for his companion Bartolommeo Ramenghi, cousin of Gio. Batista, with  whom also lived Scipione Ramenghi, son of Gio. Batista himself, and both  eminent ornamental painters during that period.    Cremonini had a rival in one Cesare Baglione, an artist in the same sphere,  and of the same eager and expeditious character in the art. He was,  moreover, a better painter of landscape, and even surpassed all others,  including the most ancient, in the method of drawing his foliage. In his  inventions too, both of a serious and comic kind, he displayed greater  novelty and variety than Cremonini. He thus became a favorite at Parma,  where in the ducal palace he left some of his best works, all in harmony  with the places which he painted; in the larder illusive eatables of every  kind, and cooks employed in dressing them; in the bakehouse utensils for  the bakers, and incidents relating thereto; in the washhouses women were  seen busied in their different duties, and all in dismay at some untoward  or comic accidents; works abounding in spirit and reality sufficient to  procure him reputation in his line, had he shewn less eagerness in the  execution. This praise will not apply, however, to his decorative taste,  which excited the ridicule of the Caracci, who were in the habit of  laughing at the fantastic ornaments of his capitals, and those arabesques,  most resembling, they declared, the staves of barrels; as well as that  custom of filling his compositions with useless ornaments, without rule or  discretion, which his own pupils afterwards proceeded to introduce,  especially Spada and Dentone. Several others were instructed by him in the  art, as Storali and Pisanelli, and some of less note, who painted well in  perspective, without aspiring to the reputation of figurists.    Thus we have taken a brief survey of the state of painting in Bologna from  the time of Bagnacavallo to the Caracci, who already rising into repute  about 1585, in some measure competed with the elder artists, and in some  measure by their example, and the spirit of emulation, tended to improve  them, of which more in the following epoch. Meanwhile, let us turn our  attention to what was passing during this period in Romagna.    Ravenna prides herself on the name of Jacopone, a pupil of Raffaello, who,  by his paintings at S. Vitale, introduced into that city the principles of  the modern style, and of whom we shall shortly state our opinion, not  without some degree of novelty. Another of Raffaello's disciples, if what  is averred of him be correct, nourished at Ravenna about 1550, called Don  Pietro da Bagnaia, a canon of the Lateran. In the church of his order he  painted the altar-piece of S. Sebastian; in the Refectory, the scriptural  history of the Loaves and Fishes, besides leaving in another place a  history-piece of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, abounding in figures  equal to the preceding. To these, enumerated by Orlandi, may be added the  picture of Padua, with the Virgin between St. John the Baptist and St.  Augustine, executed for the church of S. Giovanni di Verdara; in the  sacristy of which is a Holy Family by him, imbued with all the graces of  Raffaello in every feature and action, but sadly wanting in strength and  harmony of colouring. There is another Holy Family at the Lateran Friars in  Asti, on a larger scale, designed and composed with equal grace, but with  similar feebleness of tints, even more lifeless; and to both pieces is  appended an inscription, entreating the beholder to pray for the soul of  the painter. I am not aware whether this worthy ecclesiastic was in Ravenna  in 1547, at the period of Vasari's visit thither, but the latter makes no  mention of his name.    Yet he mentioned, among the excellent artists who still flourished there,  Luca Longhi, whose ability in the essentials of the art is highly praised.  He regrets, however, that he should always have resided in his native  place, which had he left for objects of improvement, he might have become a  very"]]]
