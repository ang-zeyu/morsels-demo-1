Agamemnon  himself would soon pay the penalty, but his son would come to avenge  him. Foretelling her own death, she hurls away the badges of her office,  the sceptre and oracular chaplets, things which have brought her nothing  but ridicule. She prays for a peaceful end without a struggle; comparing  human life to a shadow when it is fortunate and to a picture wiped out  by a sponge when it is hapless, she moves in calmly to her fate.    There is a momentary interval of reflection, then Agamemnon's dying  voice is heard as he is stricken twice. Frantic with horror, the Chorus  prepare to rush within but are checked by the Queen, who throws open the  door and stands glorying in the triumph of self-confessed murder. Her  real character is revealed in her speech.        \"This feud was not unpremeditated; rather, it proceeds from an      ancient quarrel, matured by time. Here I stand where I smote him,      over my handiwork. So I contrived it, I freely confess, that he      could neither escape his fate nor defend himself. I cast over him      the endless net, and I smote him twice--in two groans he gave up      the ghost--adding a third in grateful thanksgiving to the King of      the dead in the nether world. As he fell he gasped out his spirit,      and breathing a swift stream of gore he smote me with a drop of      murderous dew, while I rejoiced even as does the cornfield under      the Heavensent shimmering moisture when it brings the ears to the      birth. Ye Argive Elders, rejoice if ye can, but I exult. If it were      fitting to pour thank-offerings for any death, 'twere just, nay,      more than just, to offer such for him, so mighty was the bowl of      curses he filled up in his home, then came and drank them up himself      to the dregs.\"    To their solemn warning that she would herself be cut off, banished and  hated, she replies:        \"He slew my child, my dearest birth-pang, to charm the Thracian      winds. In the name of the perfect justice I have exacted for my      daughter, in the name of Ruin and Vengeance, to whom I have      sacrificed him, my hopes cannot tread the halls of fear so long      as Aegisthus is true to me. There he lies, seducer of this woman,      darling of many a Chryseis in Troyland. As for this captive      prophetess, this babbler of oracles, she sat on the ship's bench      by his side and both have fared as they deserved. He died as ye see;      but she sang her swan-song of death and lies beside him she loved,      bringing me a sweet relish for the luxury of my own love.\"    A little later she denies her very humanity.        \"Call me not his spouse; rather the ancient dread haunting evil      genius of this house has taken a woman's shape and punished him,      a full-grown man in vengeance for little children.\"    Burial he should have, but without any dirges from his people.        \"Let Iphigeneia, his daughter, as is most fitting, meet her father      at the swift-conveying passage of woe, throw her arms about him and      kiss him welcome.\"    The last scene of this splendid drama brings forward the poltroon  Aegisthus who had skulked behind in the background till the deed was  done. He enters to air his ancient grievance, reminding the Chorus how  his father was outraged by Atreus, how he himself was a banished man,  yet found his arm long enough to smite the King from far away. In  contempt for the coward the Elders prepare to offer him battle; they  appeal to Orestes to avenge the murder. The quarrel was stopped by  Clytemnestra, who had had enough of bloodshed and was content to leave  things as they were, if the gods consented thereto.    Before the sustained power of this masterpiece criticism is nearly dumb.  The conception of the inherited curse is by now familiar to us; familiar  too is the teaching that sacrilege brings its own punishment, that human  pride may be flattered into assuming the privilege of a deity. These  were enough to cause Agamemnon's undoing. But it is the part played by  Clytemnestra which fixes the dramatic interest. She is inspired by a  lust for vengeance, yet, had she known the truth that her daughter was  not dead but a priestess, she would have had no pretext for the murder.  This ignorance of essentials which originates some human action is  called Irony; it was put to dramatic uses for the first time in European  literature by Aeschylus. The horrible tragedy it may cause is clear  enough in the _Agamemnon_; its power is terrible and its value as a  dramatic source is inestimable. There is another and a far more subtle  form of Irony, in which a character uses riddling speech interpreted by  another actor in a sense different from the truth as it is known to the  spectators; this too can be used in such a manner as to charge human  speech with a sinister double meaning which bodes ruin under the mask  of words of innocence. Few dramatic personages have used this device so  effectively as Clytemnestra, certainly none with a more fiendish intent.  Again, in this play the Chorus is employed with amazing skill; their  vague uneasiness takes more and more definitely the shape of actual  terror in every ode; this terror is raised to its height in the  masterly Cassandra scene--it is then abated a little, perhaps it is just  beginning to disappear, for nobody believed Cassandra, when the blow  falls. This integral connection between the Chorus and the main action  is difficult to maintain; that it exists in the _Agamemnon_ is evidence  of a constructive genius of the highest order.    The _Choephori_ (Libation-bearers), the second play of the trilogy,  opens with the entry of Orestes. He has just laid a lock of hair on  his father's tomb and sees a band of maidens approaching, among them  Electra, his sister. He retires with Pylades his faithful friend to  listen to their conversation. The Chorus tell how in consequence of  a dream of Clytemnestra they have been sent to offer libations to the  dead, to appease their anger and resentment against the murderers.  They give utterance to a wild hopeless song, full of a presentiment of  disaster coming on successful wickedness enthroned in power. They are  captives from Troy, obliged to look on the deeds of Aegisthus, whether  just or unjust, yet they weep for the purposeless agonies of Agamemnon's  house. When asked by Electra what prayers she should offer to her dead  father, they bid her pray for some avenging god or mortal to requite the  murderers. Returning to them from the tomb, she tells them of a strange  occurrence; a lock of hair has been laid on the grave, and there are two  sets of footprints on the ground, one of which corresponds with her  own. Orestes then comes forward to reveal himself; as a proof of his  identity, he bids her consider the garments which she wove with her own  hands; urging her to restrain her joy lest she betray his arrival,  he tells how Apollo has commanded him to avenge his father's death,  threatening him with sickness, frenzy, nightly terrors, excommunication  and a dishonoured death if he refuses.    In a long choral dialogue the actors tell of Clytemnestra's insolent  treatment of the dead King; she had buried him without funeral rites or  mourning, with no subjects to follow the corpse; she even mangled his  body and thrust Electra out of the palace; thus she filled the cup of  her iniquity. The Chorus remind Orestes of his duty to act, but first he  inquires why oblations have been offered; on learning that they are the  result of Clytemnestra's dreaming that she suckled a serpent that stung  her, and that she hopes to appease the angry dead, he interprets the  dream of himself. He then unfolds his plot. He and Pylades will imitate  a Phocian dialect and will seek out and slay Aegisthus. An ode  which succeeds recounts the legends of evil women, closing with the  declaration that Justice is firmly seated in the world, that Fate  prepares a sword for a murderer and a Fury punishes him with it.    Approaching the palace Orestes summons the Queen and tells her that a  stranger called Strophius bade him bring to Argos the news that Orestes  is dead. Clytemnestra commands her servants within the house to welcome  him and sends out her son's old nurse Cilissa to take the news to  Aegisthus. The nurse stops to speak to the Chorus in the very language  of grief for the boy she had reared, like Constance in _King John_. The  Chorus advise her to summon Aegisthus alone without his bodyguard, for  Orestes is not yet dead; when she departs they pray that the end may  be speedily accomplished and the royal house cleansed of its curse.  Aegisthus crosses the stage into the palace to meet a hasty end; seeing  the deed, a servant rushes out to call Clytemnestra, while Orestes  bursts out from the house and faces his mother. For a moment his  resolution wavers; Pylades reminds him of Apollo's anger if he fails. To  his mother's plea that Destiny abetted her deed he replies that Destiny  intends her death likewise; before he thrusts her into the palace she  warns him of the avenging Furies she will send to persecute him. She  then passes to her doom.    After the Chorus have sung an ode of triumph Orestes shows the bodies of  the two who loved in sin while alive and were not separated in death. He  then displays the net which Clytemnestra threw around her husband's  body and the robe in which she caught his feet; he holds up the garment  through which Aegisthus' dagger ran. But in that very moment the cloud  of more agonies to come descends upon the hapless family. In obedience  to Apollo's command he takes the suppliant's branch and chaplet, and  prepares to hasten to Delphi, a wanderer cut off from his native land.

Only the other day I met a king in Thebes, who had been  silent already for four thousand years.          THE HASHISH MAN      I was at a dinner in London the other day. The ladies had gone upstairs,  and no one sat on my right; on my left there was a man I did not know, but  he knew my name somehow apparently, for he turned to me after a while, and  said, \"I read a story of yours about Bethmoora in a review.\"    Of course I remembered the tale. It was about a beautiful Oriental city  that was suddenly deserted in a day--nobody quite knew why. I said, \"Oh,  yes,\" and slowly searched in my mind for some more fitting acknowledgment  of the compliment that his memory had paid me.    I was greatly astonished when he said, \"You were wrong about the gnousar  sickness; it was not that at all.\"    I said, \"Why! Have you been there?\"    And he said, \"Yes; I do it with hashish. I know Bethmoora well.\" And he  took out of his pocket a small box full of some black stuff that looked  like tar, but had a stranger smell. He warned me not to touch it with my  finger, as the stain remained for days. \"I got it from a gipsy,\" he said.  \"He had a lot of it, as it had killed his father.\" But I interrupted him,  for I wanted to know for certain what it was that had made desolate that  beautiful city, Bethmoora, and why they fled from it swiftly in a day.  \"Was it because of the Desert's curse?\" I asked. And he said, \"Partly it  was the fury of the Desert and partly the advice of the Emperor Thuba  Mleen, for that fearful beast is in some way connected with the Desert on  his mother's side.\" And he told me this strange story: \"You remember the  sailor with the black scar, who was there on the day that you described  when the messengers came on mules to the gate of Bethmoora, and all the  people fled. I met this man in a tavern, drinking rum, and he told me all  about the flight from Bethmoora, but knew no more than you did what the  message was, or who had sent it. However, he said he would see Bethmoora  once more whenever he touched again at an eastern port, even if he had to  face the Devil. He often said that he would face the Devil to find out the  mystery of that message that emptied Bethmoora in a day. And in the end he  had to face Thuba Mleen, whose weak ferocity he had not imagined. For one  day the sailor told me he had found a ship, and I met him no more after  that in the tavern drinking rum. It was about that time that I got the  hashish from the gipsy, who had a quantity that he did not want. It takes  one literally out of oneself. It is like wings. You swoop over distant  countries and into other worlds. Once I found out the secret of the  universe. I have forgotten what it was, but I know that the Creator does  not take Creation seriously, for I remember that He sat in Space with all  His work in front of Him and laughed. I have seen incredible things in  fearful worlds. As it is your imagination that takes you there, so it is  only by your imagination that you can get back. Once out in aether I met a  battered, prowling spirit, that had belonged to a man whom drugs had  killed a hundred years ago; and he led me to regions that I had never  imagined; and we parted in anger beyond the Pleiades, and I could not  imagine my way back. And I met a huge grey shape that was the Spirit of  some great people, perhaps of a whole star, and I besought It to show me  my way home, and It halted beside me like a sudden wind and pointed, and,  speaking quite softly, asked me if I discerned a certain tiny light, and I  saw a far star faintly, and then It said to me, 'That is the Solar  System,' and strode tremendously on. And somehow I imagined my way back,  and only just in time, for my body was already stiffening in a chair in my  room; and the fire had gone out and everything was cold, and I had to move  each finger one by one, and there were pins and needles in them, and  dreadful pains in the nails, which began to thaw; and at last I could move  one arm, and reached a bell, and for a long time no one came, because  every one was in bed. But at last a man appeared, and they got a doctor;  and HE said that it was hashish poisoning, but it would have been all  right if I hadn't met that battered, prowling spirit.    \"I could tell you astounding things that I have seen, but you want to know  who sent that message to Bethmoora. Well, it was Thuba Mleen. And this is  how I know. I often went to the city after that day you wrote of (I used  to take hashish of an evening in my flat), and I always found it  uninhabited. Sand had poured into it from the desert, and the streets were  yellow and smooth, and through open, swinging doors the sand had drifted.    \"One evening I had put the guard in front of the fire, and settled into a  chair and eaten my hashish, and the first thing that I saw when I came to  Bethmoora was the sailor with the black scar, strolling down the street,  and making footprints in the yellow sand. And now I knew that I should see  what secret power it was that kept Bethmoora uninhabited.    \"I saw that there was anger in the Desert, for there were storm clouds  heaving along the skyline, and I heard a muttering amongst the sand.    \"The sailor strolled on down the street, looking into the empty houses as  he went; sometimes he shouted and sometimes he sang, and sometimes he  wrote his name on a marble wall. Then he sat down on a step and ate his  dinner. After a while he grew tired of the city, and came back up the  street. As he reached the gate of green copper three men on camels  appeared.    \"I could do nothing. I was only a consciousness, invisible, wandering: my  body was in Europe. The sailor fought well with his fists, but he was  over-powered and bound with ropes, and led away through the Desert.    \"I followed for as long as I could stay, and found that they were going by  the way of the Desert round the Hills of Hap towards Utnar Vehi, and then  I knew that the camel men belonged to Thuba Mleen.    \"I work in an insurance office all day, and I hope you won't forget me if  ever you want to insure--life, fire, or motor--but that's no part of my  story. I was desperately anxious to get back to my flat, though it is not  good to take hashish two days running; but I wanted to see what they would  do to the poor fellow, for I had heard bad rumours about Thuba Mleen. When  at last I got away I had a letter to write; then I rang for my servant,  and told him that I must not be disturbed, though I left my door unlocked  in case of accidents. After that I made up a good fire, and sat down and  partook of the pot of dreams. I was going to the palace of Thuba Mleen.    \"I was kept back longer than usual by noises in the street, but suddenly I  was up above the town; the European countries rushed by beneath me, and  there appeared the thin white palace spires of horrible Thuba Mleen. I  found him presently at the end of a little narrow room. A curtain of red  leather hung behind him, on which all the names of God, written in  Yannish, were worked with a golden thread. Three windows were small and  high. The Emperor seemed no more than about twenty, and looked small and  weak. No smiles came on his nasty yellow face, though he tittered  continually. As I looked from his low forehead to his quivering under lip,  I became aware that there was some horror about him, though I was not able  to perceive what it was. And then I saw it--the man never blinked; and  though later on I watched those eyes for a blink, it never happened once.    \"And then I followed the Emperor's rapt glance, and I saw the sailor lying  on the floor, alive but hideously rent, and the royal torturers were at  work all round him. They had torn long strips from him, but had not  detached them, and they were torturing the ends of them far away from the  sailor.\" The man that I met at dinner told me many things which I must  omit. \"The sailor was groaning softly, and every time he groaned Thuba  Mleen tittered. I had no sense of smell, but I could hear and see, and I  do not know which was the most revolting--the terrible condition of the  sailor or the happy unblinking face of horrible Thuba Mleen.    \"I wanted to go away, but the time was not yet come, and I had to stay  where I was.    \"Suddenly the Emperor's face began to twitch violently and his under lip  quivered faster, and he whimpered with anger, and cried with a shrill  voice, in Yannish, to the captain of his torturers that there was a spirit  in the room. I feared not, for living men cannot lay hands on a spirit,  but all the torturers were appalled at his anger, and stopped their work,  for their hands trembled in fear. Then two men of the spear-guard slipped  from the room, and each of them brought back presently a golden bowl, with  knobs on it, full of hashish; and the bowls were large enough for heads to  have floated in had they been filled with blood. And the two men fell to  rapidly, each eating with two great spoons--there was enough in each  spoonful to have given dreams to a hundred men. And there came upon them  soon the hashish state, and their spirits hovered, preparing to go free,  while I feared horribly, but ever and anon they fell back again to their  bodies, recalled by some noise in the room. Still the men ate, but lazily  now, and without ferocity. At last the great spoons dropped out of their  hands, and their spirits rose and left them. I could not flee. And the  spirits were more horrible than the men, because they were young men, and  not yet wholly moulded to fit their fearful souls. Still the sailor  groaned softly, evoking little titters from the Emperor Thuba Mleen. Then  the two spirits rushed at me, and swept me thence as gusts of wind sweep  butterflies, and away we went from that small, pale, heinous man. There  was no escaping from these spirits' fierce insistence. The energy in my  minute lump of the drug was overwhelmed by the huge"]]]
