The knights and squires all began to  wonder why he was being armed; but no one dared to ask him why. When  they had put on his hauberk, a valet laces about his head a helmet  fluted with a band of gold, shining brighter than a mirror. Then he  takes the sword and girds it on, and orders them to bring him saddled  his bay steed of Gascony. Then he calls a valet to him, and says:  \"Valet, go quickly, run to the chamber beside the tower where my wife  is, and tell her that she is keeping me waiting here too long. She has  spent too much time on her attire. Tell her to come and mount at once,  for I am awaiting her.\" And the fellow goes and finds her all ready,  weeping and making moan: and he straightway addressed her thus: \"Lady,  why do you so delay? My lord is awaiting you outside yonder, already  fully armed. He would have mounted some time ago, had you been ready.\"  Enide wondered greatly what her lord's intention was; but she very  wisely showed herself with as cheerful a countenance as possible, when  she appeared before him. In the middle of the courtyard she found him,  and King Lac comes running out. Knights come running, too, striving with  each other to reach there first. There is neither young nor old but goes  to learn and ask if he will take any of them with him. So each offers  and presents himself. But he states definitely and affirms that he will  take no companion except his wife, asserting that he will go alone.  Then the King is in great distress. \"Fair son,\" says he, \"what dost thou  intend to do? Thou shouldst tell me thy business and keep nothing back.  Tell me whither thou will go; for thou art unwilling on any account  to be accompanied by an escort of squires or knights. If thou hast  undertaken to fight some knight in single combat, yet shouldst thou not  for that reason fail to take a part of thy knights with thee to betoken  thy wealth and lordship. A king's son ought not to fare alone. Fair son,  have thy sumpters loaded now, and take thirty or forty or more of thy  knights, and see that silver and gold is taken, and whatever a gentleman  needs.\" Finally Erec makes reply and tells him all in detail how he has  planned his journey. \"Sire,\" says he, \"it must be so. I shall take no  extra horse, nor have I any use for gold or silver, squire or sergeant;  nor do I ask for any company save that of my wife alone. But I pray you,  whatever may happen, should I die and she come back, to love her and  hold her dear for love of me and for my prayer, and give her so long as  she live, without contention or any strife, the half of your land to be  her own.\" Upon hearing his son's request, the King said: \"Fair son, I  promise it. But I grieve much to see thee thus go off without escort,  and if I had my way, thou shouldst not thus depart.\" \"Sire, it cannot  be otherwise. I go now, and to God commend you. But keep in mind my  companions, and give them horses and arms and all that knight may need.\"  The King cannot keep back the tears when he is parted from his son. The  people round about weep too; the ladies and knights shed tears and make  great moan for him. There is not one who does not mourn, and many a one  in the courtyard swoons. Weeping, they kiss and embrace him, and are  almost beside themselves with grief. I think they would not have been  more sad if they had seen him dead or wounded. Then Erec said to comfort  them: \"My lords, why do you weep so sore? I am neither in prison nor  wounded. You gain nothing by this display of grief. If I go away, I  shall come again when it please God and when I can. To God I commend you  one and all; so now let me go; too long you keep me here. I am sorry and  grieved to see you weep.\" To God he commends them and they him.    (Vv. 2765-2924.) So they departed, leaving sorrow behind them. Erec  starts, and leads his wife he knows not whither, as chance dictates.  \"Ride fast,\" he says, \"and take good care not to be so rash as to speak  to me of anything you may see. Take care never to speak to me, unless I  address you first. Ride on now fast and with confidence.\" \"Sire,\" says  she, \"it shall be done.\" She rode ahead and held her peace. Neither one  nor the other spoke a word. But Enide's heart is very sad, and within  herself she thus laments, soft and low that he may not hear: \"Alas,\" she  says, \"God had raised and exalted me to such great joy; but now He  has suddenly cast me down. Fortune who had beckoned me has quickly now  withdrawn her hand. I should not mind that so much, alas, if only I  dared to address my lord. But I am mortified and distressed because my  lord has turned against me, I see it clearly, since he will not speak  to me. And I am not so bold as to dare to look at him.\" While she thus  laments, a knight who lived by robbery issued forth from the woods. He  had two companions with him, and all three were armed. They covet the  palfrey which Enide rides. \"My lords, do you know the news I bring?\"  says he to his two companions. \"If we do not now make a haul, we are  good-for-nothing cowards and are playing in bad luck. Here comes a lady  wondrous fair, whether married or not I do not know, but she is very  richly dressed. The palfrey and saddle, with the breast-strap and reins,  are worth a thousand livres of Chartres. I will take the palfrey for  mine, and the rest of the booty you may have. I don't want any more for  my share. The knight shall not lead away the lady, so help me God. For I  intend to give him such a thrust as he will dearly pay. I it was who saw  him first, and so it is my right to go the first and offer battle.\"  They give him leave and he rides off, crouching well beneath his shield,  while the other two remain aloof. In those days it was the custom and  practice that in an attack two knights should not join against one;  thus if they too had assailed him, it would seem that they had acted  treacherously. Enide saw the robbers, and was seized with great fear.  \"God,\" says she, \"what can I say? Now my lord will be either killed  or made a prisoner; for there are three of them and he is alone. The  contest is not fair between one knight and three. That fellow will  strike him now at a disadvantage; for my lord is off his guard. God,  shall I be then such a craven as not to dare to raise my voice? Such a  coward I will not be: I will not fail to speak to him.\" On the spot  she turns about and calls to him: \"Fair sire, of what are you thinking?  There come riding after you three knights who press you hard. I greatly  fear they will do you harm.\" \"What?\" says Erec, \"what's that you say?  You have surely been very bold to disdain my command and prohibition.  This time you shall be pardoned; but if it should happen another time,  you would not be forgiven.\" Then turning his shield and lance, he rushes  at the knight. The latter sees him coming and challenges him. When Erec  hears him, he defies him. Both give spur and clash together, holding  their lances at full extent. But he missed Erec, while Erec used him  hard; for he knew well the right attack. He strikes him on the shield  so fiercely that he cracks it from top to bottom. Nor is his hauberk any  protection: Erec pierces and crushes it in the middle of his breast, and  thrusts a foot and a half of his lance into his body. When he drew back,  he pulled out the shaft. And the other fell to earth. He must needs die,  for the blade had drunk of his life's blood. Then one of the other two  rushes forward, leaving his companion behind, and spurs toward Erec,  threatening him. Erec firmly grasps his shield, and attacks him with  a stout heart. The other holds his shield before his breast. Then they  strike upon the emblazoned shields. The knight's lance flies into two  bits, while Erec drives a quarter of lance's length through the other's  breast. He will give him no more trouble. Erec unhorses him and leaves  him in a faint, while he spurs at an angle toward the third robber. When  the latter saw him coming on he began to make his escape. He was afraid,  and did not dare to face him; so he hastened to take refuge in the  woods. But his flight is of small avail, for Erec follows him close  and cries aloud: \"Vassal, vassal, turn about now, and prepare to defend  yourself, so that I may not slay you in act of flight. It is useless  to try to escape.\" But the fellow has no desire to turn about, and  continues to flee with might and main. Following and overtaking him,  Erec hits him squarely on his painted shield, and throws him over on the  other side. To these three robbers he gives no further heed: one he has  killed, another wounded, and of the third he got rid by throwing him  to earth from his steed. He took the horses of all three and tied them  together by the bridles. In colour they were not alike: the first was  white as milk, the second black and not at all bad looking, while the  third was dappled all over. He came back to the road where Enide was  awaiting him. He bade her lead and drive the three horses in front of  her, warning her harshly never again to be so bold as to speak a single  word unless he give her leave. She makes answer: \"I will never do so,  fair sire, if it be your will.\" Then they ride on, and she holds her  peace.    (Vv. 2925-3085.) They had not yet gone a league when before them in a  valley there came five other knights, with lances in rest, shields held  close in to the neck, and their shining helmets laced up tight; they,  too, were on plunder bent. All at once they saw the lady approach in  charge of the three horses, and Erec who followed after. As soon as they  saw them, they divided their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/832"],[0,"Robin Hood (#13)"],[1,"before him, while the old  knight, held an unwilling witness, gnashed his teeth in impotent rage;  and the friar began with the ceremony.    When he asked, \"Who giveth this woman?\" Robin stepped up and answered in  a clear voice:    \"I do! I, Robin Hood of Barnesdale and Sherwood! And he who takes her  from Allan-a-Dale shall buy her full dearly.\"    So the twain were declared man and wife and duly blessed; and the bride  was kissed by each sturdy yeoman beginning with Robin Hood.    Now I cannot end this jolly tale better than in the words of the ballad  which came out of the happening and which has been sung in the villages  and countryside ever since:         \"And thus having end of this merry wedding,       The bride lookt like a queen;       And so they returned to the merry greenwood       Amongst the leaves so green.\"        CHAPTER IX    HOW THE WIDOW'S THREE SONS WERE RESCUED         Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone,       With a link a down and a down,       And there he met with the proud Sheriff,       Was walking along the town.    The wedding-party was a merry one that left Plympton Church, I ween; but  not so merry were the ones left behind. My lord Bishop of Hereford  was stuck up in the organ-loft and left, gownless and fuming. The ten  liveried archers were variously disposed about the church to keep him  company; two of them being locked in a tiny crypt, three in the belfry,  \"to ring us a wedding peal,\" as Robin said; and the others under  quire seats or in the vestry. The bride's brother at her entreaty was  released, but bidden not to return to the church that day or interfere  with his sister again on pain of death. While the rusty old knight was  forced to climb a high tree, where he sat insecurely perched among the  branches, feebly cursing the party as it departed.    It was then approaching sundown, but none of the retainers or villagers  dared rescue the imprisoned ones that night, for fear of Robin Hood's  men. So it was not until sunup the next day, that they were released.  The Bishop and the old knight, stiff as they were, did not delay longer  than for breakfast, but so great was their rage and shame--made straight  to Nottingham and levied the Sheriff's forces. The Sheriff himself was  not anxious to try conclusions again with Robin in the open. Perhaps he  had some slight scruples regarding his oath. But the others swore that  they would go straight to the King, if he did not help them, so he was  fain to consent.    A force of an hundred picked men from the Royal Foresters and swordsmen  of the shire was gathered together and marched straightway into the  greenwood. There, as fortune would have it, they surprised some score of  outlaws hunting, and instantly gave chase. But they could not surround  the outlaws, who kept well in the lead, ever and anon dropping behind  a log or boulder to speed back a shaft which meant mischief to the  pursuers. One shaft indeed carried off the Sheriff's hat and caused  that worthy man to fall forward upon his horse's neck from sheer terror;  while five other arrows landed in the fleshy parts of Foresters' arms.    But the attacking party was not wholly unsuccessful. One outlaw in his  flight stumbled and fell; when two others instantly stopped and helped  to put him on his feet again. They were the widow's three sons, Stout  Will, and Lester, and John. The pause was an unlucky one for them, as  a party of Sheriff's men got above them and cut them off from their  fellows. Swordsmen came up in the rear, and they were soon hemmed in on  every side. But they gave good account of themselves, and before they  had been overborne by force of numbers they had killed two and disabled  three more.    The infuriated attackers were almost on the point of hewing the stout  outlaws to pieces, when the Sheriff cried:    \"Hold! Bind the villains! We will follow the law in this and take them  to the town jail. But I promise ye the biggest public hanging that has  been seen in this shire for many changes of the moon!\"    So they bound the widow's three sons and carried them back speedily to  Nottingham.    Now Robin Hood had not chanced to be near the scene of the fight, or  with his men; so for a time he heard nothing of the happening.    But that evening while returning to the camp he was met by the widow  herself, who came weeping along the way.    \"What news, what news, good woman?\" said Robin hastily but courteously;  for he liked her well.    \"God save ye, Master Robin!\" said the dame wildly. \"God keep ye from the  fate that has met my three sons! The Sheriff has laid hands on them and  they are condemned to die.\"    \"Now, by our Lady! That cuts me to the heart! Stout Will, and Lester,  and merry John! The earliest friends I had in the band, and still among  the bravest! It must not be! When is this hanging set?\"    \"Middle the tinker tells me that it is for tomorrow noon,\" replied the  dame.    \"By the truth o' my body,\" quoth Robin, \"you could not tell me in better  time. The memory of the old days when you freely bade me sup and dine  would spur me on, even if three of the bravest lads in all the shire  were not imperiled. Trust to me, good woman!\"    The old widow threw herself on the ground and embraced his knees.    \"'Tis dire danger I am asking ye to face,\" she said weeping; \"and yet I  knew your brave true heart would answer me. Heaven help ye, good Master  Robin, to answer a poor widow's prayers!\"    Then Robin Hood sped straightway to the forest-camp, where he heard the  details of the skirmish--how that his men had been out-numbered five to  one, but got off safely, as they thought, until a count of their members  had shown the loss of the widow's three sons.    \"We must rescue them, my men!\" quoth Robin, \"even from out the shadow of  the rope itself!\"    Whereupon the band set to work to devise ways and means.    Robin walked apart a little way with his head leaned thoughtfully upon  his breast--for he was sore troubled--when whom should he meet but an  old begging palmer, one of a devout order which made pilgrimages and  wandered from place to place, supported by charity.    This old fellow walked boldly up to Robin and asked alms of him; since  Robin had been wont to aid members of his order.    \"What news, what news, thou foolish old man?\" said Robin, \"what news, I  do thee pray?\"    \"Three squires in Nottingham town,\" quoth the palmer, \"are condemned  to die. Belike that is greater news than the shire has had in some  Sundays.\"    Then Robin's long-sought idea came to him like a flash.    \"Come, change thine apparel with me, old man,\" he said, \"and I'll give  thee forty shillings in good silver to spend in beer or wine.\"    \"O, thine apparel is good,\" the palmer protested, \"and mine is ragged  and torn. The holy church teaches that thou should'st ne'er laugh an old  man to scorn.\"    \"I am in simple earnest, I say. Come, change thine apparel with mine.  Here are twenty pieces of good broad gold to feast they brethren right  royally.\"    So the palmer was persuaded; and Robin put on the old man's hat, which  stood full high in the crown; and his cloak, patched with black and  blue and red, like Joseph's coat of many colors in its old age; and  his breeches, which had been sewed over with so many patterns that the  original was scarce discernible; and his tattered hose; and his shoes,  cobbled above and below. And while as he made the change in dress he  made so many whimsical comments also about a man's pride and the dress  that makes a man, that the palmer was like to choke with cackling  laughter.    I warrant you, the two were comical sights when they parted company that  day. Nathless, Robin's own mother would not have known him, had she been  living.    The next morning the whole town of Nottingham was early astir, and as  soon as the gates were open country-folk began to pour in; for a triple  hanging was not held there every day in the week, and the bustle almost  equated a Fair day.    Robin Hood in his palmer's disguise was one of the first ones to enter  the gates, and he strolled up and down and around the town as though he  had never been there before in all his life. Presently he came to the  market-place, and beheld thereon three gallows erected.    \"Who are these builded for, my son?\" asked he of a rough soldier  standing by.    \"For three of Robin Hood's men,\" answered the other. \"And it were Robin  himself, 'twould be thrice as high I warrant ye. But Robin is too smart  to get within the Sheriff's clutches again.\"    The palmer crossed himself.    \"They say that he is a bold fellow,\" he whined.    \"Ha!\" said the soldier, \"he may be bold enough out behind stumps i' the  forest, but the open market-place is another matter.\"    \"Who is to hang these three poor wretches?\" asked the palmer.    \"That hath the Sheriff not decided. But here he comes now to answer his  own questions.\" And the soldier came to stiff attention as the Sheriff  and his body-guard stalked pompously up to inspect the gallows.    \"O, Heaven save you, worshipful Sheriff!\" said the palmer. \"Heaven  protect you! What will you give a silly old man to-day to be your  hangman?\"    \"Who are you, fellow?\" asked the Sheriff sharply.    \"Naught save a poor old palmer. But I can shrive their souls and hang  their bodies most devoutly.\"    \"Very good,\" replied the other. \"The fee to-day is thirteen pence; and  I will add thereunto some suits of clothing for that ragged back of  yours.\"    \"God bless ye!\" said the palmer. And he went with the soldier to the  jail to prepare his three men for execution.    Just before the stroke of noon the doors of the prison opened and the  procession of the condemned came forth. Down through the long lines of  packed people they walked to the market-place, the palmer in the lead,  and the widow's three sons marching firmly erect between soldiers.    At the gallows foot they halted. The palmer whispered to them, as though"]]]
