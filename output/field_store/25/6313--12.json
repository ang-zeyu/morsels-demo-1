No  particular order or position ever continues a moment unaltered. The  original force, still remaining in activity, gives a perpetual  restlessness to matter. Every possible situation is produced, and  instantly destroyed. If a glimpse or dawn of order appears for a moment,  it is instantly hurried away, and confounded, by that never-ceasing force  which actuates every part of matter.    Thus the universe goes on for many ages in a continued succession of  chaos and disorder. But is it not possible that it may settle at last, so  as not to lose its motion and active force (for that we have supposed  inherent in it), yet so as to preserve an uniformity of appearance,  amidst the continual motion and fluctuation of its parts? This we find to  be the case with the universe at present. Every individual is perpetually  changing, and every part of every individual; and yet the whole remains,  in appearance, the same. May we not hope for such a position, or rather  be assured of it, from the eternal revolutions of unguided matter; and  may not this account for all the appearing wisdom and contrivance which  is in the universe? Let us contemplate the subject a little, and we shall  find, that this adjustment, if attained by matter of a seeming stability  in the forms, with a real and perpetual revolution or motion of parts,  affords a plausible, if not a true solution of the difficulty.    It is in vain, therefore, to insist upon the uses of the parts in animals  or vegetables, and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain  know, how an animal could subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted? Do  we not find, that it immediately perishes whenever this adjustment  ceases, and that its matter corrupting tries some new form? It happens  indeed, that the parts of the world are so well adjusted, that some  regular form immediately lays claim to this corrupted matter: and if it  were not so, could the world subsist? Must it not dissolve as well as the  animal, and pass through new positions and situations, till in great, but  finite succession, it falls at last into the present or some such order?    It is well, replied CLEANTHES, you told us, that this hypothesis was  suggested on a sudden, in the course of the argument. Had you had leisure  to examine it, you would soon have perceived the insuperable objections  to which it is exposed. No form, you say, can subsist, unless it possess  those powers and organs requisite for its subsistence: some new order or  economy must be tried, and so on, without intermission; till at last some  order, which can support and maintain itself, is fallen upon. But  according to this hypothesis, whence arise the many conveniences and  advantages which men and all animals possess? Two eyes, two ears, are not  absolutely necessary for the subsistence of the species. Human race might  have been propagated and preserved, without horses, dogs, cows, sheep,  and those innumerable fruits and products which serve to our satisfaction  and enjoyment. If no camels had been created for the use of man in the  sandy deserts of AFRICA and ARABIA, would the world have been dissolved?  If no lodestone had been framed to give that wonderful and useful  direction to the needle, would human society and the human kind have been  immediately extinguished? Though the maxims of Nature be in general very  frugal, yet instances of this kind are far from being rare; and any one  of them is a sufficient proof of design, and of a benevolent design,  which gave rise to the order and arrangement of the universe.    At least, you may safely infer, said PHILO, that the foregoing hypothesis  is so far incomplete and imperfect, which I shall not scruple to allow.  But can we ever reasonably expect greater success in any attempts of this  nature? Or can we ever hope to erect a system of cosmogony, that will be  liable to no exceptions, and will contain no circumstance repugnant to  our limited and imperfect experience of the analogy of Nature? Your  theory itself cannot surely pretend to any such advantage, even though  you have run into Anthropomorphism, the better to preserve a conformity  to common experience. Let us once more put it to trial. In all instances  which we have ever seen, ideas are copied from real objects, and are  ectypal, not archetypal, to express myself in learned terms: You reverse  this order, and give thought the precedence. In all instances which we  have ever seen, thought has no influence upon matter, except where that  matter is so conjoined with it as to have an equal reciprocal influence  upon it. No animal can move immediately any thing but the members of its  own body; and indeed, the equality of action and reaction seems to be an  universal law of nature: But your theory implies a contradiction to this  experience. These instances, with many more, which it were easy to  collect, (particularly the supposition of a mind or system of thought  that is eternal, or, in other words, an animal ingenerable and immortal);  these instances, I say, may teach all of us sobriety in condemning each  other, and let us see, that as no system of this kind ought ever to be  received from a slight analogy, so neither ought any to be rejected on  account of a small incongruity. For that is an inconvenience from which  we can justly pronounce no one to be exempted.    All religious systems, it is confessed, are subject to great and  insuperable difficulties. Each disputant triumphs in his turn; while he  carries on an offensive war, and exposes the absurdities, barbarities,  and pernicious tenets of his antagonist. But all of them, on the whole,  prepare a complete triumph for the Sceptic; who tells them, that no  system ought ever to be embraced with regard to such subjects: For this  plain reason, that no absurdity ought ever to be assented to with regard  to any subject. A total suspense of judgement is here our only reasonable  resource. And if every attack, as is commonly observed, and no defence,  among Theologians, is successful; how complete must be his victory, who  remains always, with all mankind, on the offensive, and has himself no  fixed station or abiding city, which he is ever, on any occasion, obliged  to defend?          PART 9      But if so many difficulties attend the argument a posteriori, said DEMEA,  had we not better adhere to that simple and sublime argument a priori,  which, by offering to us infallible demonstration, cuts off at once all  doubt and difficulty? By this argument, too, we may prove the infinity of  the Divine attributes, which, I am afraid, can never be ascertained with  certainty from any other topic. For how can an effect, which either is  finite, or, for aught we know, may be so; how can such an effect, I say,  prove an infinite cause? The unity too of the Divine Nature, it is very  difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to deduce merely from  contemplating the works of nature; nor will the uniformity alone of the  plan, even were it allowed, give us any assurance of that attribute.  Whereas the argument a priori ...    You seem to reason, DEMEA, interposed CLEANTHES, as if those advantages  and conveniences in the abstract argument were full proofs of its  solidity. But it is first proper, in my opinion, to determine what  argument of this nature you choose to insist on; and we shall afterwards,  from itself, better than from its useful consequences, endeavour to  determine what value we ought to put upon it.    The argument, replied DEMEA, which I would insist on, is the common one.  Whatever exists must have a cause or reason of its existence; it being  absolutely impossible for any thing to produce itself, or be the cause of  its own existence. In mounting up, therefore, from effects to causes, we  must either go on in tracing an infinite succession, without any ultimate  cause at all; or must at last have recourse to some ultimate cause, that  is necessarily existent: Now, that the first supposition is absurd, may  be thus proved. In the infinite chain or succession of causes and  effects, each single effect is determined to exist by the power and  efficacy of that cause which immediately preceded; but the whole eternal  chain or succession, taken together, is not determined or caused by any  thing; and yet it is evident that it requires a cause or reason, as much  as any particular object which begins to exist in time. The question is  still reasonable, why this particular succession of causes existed from  eternity, and not any other succession, or no succession at all. If there  be no necessarily existent being, any supposition which can be formed is  equally possible; nor is there any more absurdity in Nothing's having  existed from eternity, than there is in that succession of causes which  constitutes the universe. What was it, then, which determined Something  to exist rather than Nothing, and bestowed being on a particular  possibility, exclusive of the rest? External causes, there are supposed  to be none. Chance is a word without a meaning. Was it Nothing? But that  can never produce any thing. We must, therefore, have recourse to a  necessarily existent Being, who carries the REASON of his existence in  himself, and who cannot be supposed not to exist, without an express  contradiction. There is, consequently, such a Being; that is, there is a  Deity.    I shall not leave it to PHILO, said CLEANTHES, though I know that the  starting objections is his chief delight, to point out the weakness of  this metaphysical reasoning. It seems to me so obviously ill-grounded,  and at the same time of so little consequence to the cause of true piety  and religion, that I shall myself venture to show the fallacy of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],[0,"Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#13)"],[1,"head to  the soles of the feet,\" modern christianity, whether Protestant or  Catholic, \"is full of wounds and bruises, and putrifying sores.\"    The prophets and apostles foresaw the Gentile apostacy that would  spread over the earth, under the plausible name of christianity,  obliterating the knowledge of God, and \"denying the power of God, and  changing his laws and ordinances,\" till \"gross darkness should cover  the people.\" They saw the \"mystery of iniquity\" working, and boldly  foretold the \"_falling away_\"--the exaltation of the man of sin,--the  removal of the priesthood and light of truth from the seven churches  of Asia,--the refusal to \"teach all things that Jesus commanded,\"--the  irresistible fact, that men would not \"_endure sound doctrines_,\" but  would multiply discrepant teachers to suit \"_itching ears_,\"--the  introduction of \"_damnable heresies_,\" and the \"_doctrines of devils_,\"  and the church becoming like a blood-guilty \"_harlot_,\" that had  exterminated the whole order of apostles, and prophets, and spiritual  gifts, and even denied the need of any such order of gifts and ministry  as existed in the primitive church!    The first doctrine of the devil in the garden was that it was not  necessary to obey God concerning a particular tree of the garden;  and the same doctrine of _devils_ has, _by inches and by piece-meal_  removed and broken every command of Christ, and put bishops and doctors  in the seats of apostles and prophets, and the ordinance of sprinkling  infants, in place of baptism; virtually saying, \"that God doth know,\"  that without the aid of apostles and the gift of the Spirit by laying  on of hands, you can know truth _enough_; and without baptism \"_for  remission of sins_,\" you can be forgiven through prayer at the altar.    Permit me, sir, in the conclusion to remind you of the reproof given  by an inspired wise man. \"_Say not thou what is the cause that the  former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely  concerning this_.\" The true and only rational revealed cause why  modern christianity is so weak, contentious, discrepant, and so  unlike the majestic, almighty christianity of apostolic days, is,  because _apostate uninspired men_ \"HAVE TRANSGRESSED the LAWS, CHANGED  the ORDINANCES, and BROKEN the EVERLASTING COVENANT.\" Therefore,  _the \"earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof.\"_ \"Gentile\"  christianity will yet be compelled to come from the \"_ends of the earth  and say, surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things  wherein there is no profit_.\"    _And God has said, sir, because \"your_ (Gentile) _fathers have  forsaken him and have not kept his law,\" \"therefore,\" says God,  \"behold, I will this once cause them to know mine hand and my might,  and they shall know that my name is the Lord.\" The land shall be  utterly emptied and utterly spoiled; for the Lord hath spoken this  word, the earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth  and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish. The  earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they  have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances, and broken the  everlasting covenant. Therefore, hath the curse devoured the earth, and  they that dwell therein are desolate; therefore, the inhabitants of the  earth are burned, and few men left.\"_    In view of these things, dear sir, my fervent prayer is, that you  and all my brethren in the sectarian ministry will, from this day  forth, stay their hand and voice from upholding modern _boasting_  christianity--that is a \"stink\" in the nose of Jehovah--that is  _depopulating the earth and abrogating the laws, and ordinances of  God_, and sin no more, and thereby follow the humble example of    Your obedient servant,    ORSON SPENCER.        LETTER VII.    THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF AN APOSTOLIC CHURCH.    _Liverpool, August_ 28, 1847.    Reverend and Dear Sir,--The next subject in the order of my promise,  contained in my first letter to you, is, THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF AN  APOSTOLIC CHURCH, after the similitude and power of the primitive  church. Such an occurrence as this, truly demands proof of a palpable  and satisfactory order, which, by the help of God, I will proceed to  give you.    The beloved apostle John, who survived many of his fellow-labourers  in the gospel, and saw many damnable heresies coming into the church,  and making havoc of all the faithful, and even the seven most faithful  churches in all the earth probably, right under his own faithful  supervision, yielding to APOSTACY, and going over to Satan. This  apostle, dear sir, in his solitary grief, was shewn, by revelation  from God, the RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRUE CHURCH, with such wrath  and vengeance following its wake, as should make an utter end of  wickedness, give the righteous a thousand years rest, cleanse the earth  by blood and burning, and bind the devil until the \"little season.\"    Now mark, sir, the emphatic words of this apostle before he left the  earth, concerning what he saw would come in the last days. Hear now  with a fixed ear, and an unbiassed determined purpose to believe, and  abide the declaration of your own apostle John. Now to the momentous  words that cheered the few banished persecuted Saints, that survived  the bloody hand of Gentile apostacy. Says he:--\"_I saw another angel  flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to  preach to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people; saying, Fear God  and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come_.\"    There is no obscurity about this language. It is quite as intelligible  and free from ambiguity as the language that predicted the marvellous  manner of the coming of Christ, which, however, men would not  understand, through prejudice. \"Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear  a son,\" &c.    Now, sir, is it at all incredible that an angel should come to men?  Or is it incredible that he should come soaring, or \"_flying_ in the  midst of heaven to earth?\" You certainly believe, that Jesus Christ and  Elijah soared from the earth up through the air, or visible heavens.  Is it not also credible, that God should employ an angel to carry a  message to the nations? And as God ministered the law by angels to one  man, Moses, for a whole nation, even so the angel that John saw, would  minister his gospel message to some _particular_ man, and that man  should bear it to the nations of the earth.    Now, to what man might we expect an angel would bring such a message of  vast importance? A great and wise man, or obscure and ignorant, or an  old or young man? If we look at the past, we shall find that John was a  boisterous fellow, from the wilderness, that had no fellowship for any  existing religion whatever. He struck the axe deep at the root of every  religious organization, notwithstanding there were, probably, some good  men in every sect, but they were in error. This man, sir, was first and  chief pioneer to the Lord of life.    And who comes next to receive a message for all nations, and hold  the keys of revelation for all nations? Now, reverend sir, fix the  eye of your mind steadily upon him. And who is he? An honest, hardy,  illiterate, bold, rough fisherman, that perhaps never saw the inside  of a gentleman's drawing-room. Here, sir, is the wisdom of God and  confusion for man. But to return. Who is the man, to whom the angel  shall give the gospel message of all nations, in the last days,  according to the vision of John, the revelator? Let God, the Holy One  of all the earth, speak in this matter, and let all the ends of the  earth believe HIS holy word.    The Lord God of all flesh, sir, by the mouth of his servant Zechariah,  tells us precisely what kind of man this angel would speak to, and give  the gospel, in the last dispensation. Speaking of the two great events  (the building of Zion and Jerusalem, in the last days), Zechariah, with  his ear open to the revelation of the same great event as John's was,  says he heard the mandate of the Almighty to the angel, saying, \"Go and  speak to that _young_ man.\"    Here we have it, sir, in the language and testimony of God himself, by  the mouths of his two servants, John, the revelator, and Zechariah.  John saw, after much inquiry before God about the restoration of the  gospel to the earth, in clear vision, the angel in his downward flight  through the heavens to earth, and also heard him proclaim his errand,  and the message of joy and wo to the nations of the last days. The  other servant of God, Zechariah, like John, equally intent to know  whether the true gospel ever would triumph in all the earth, and  wickedness come to an end, had the happiness to see the angel, at the  end of his downward flight, place his feet upon the earth, and witness  the finger of God raised, and pointing the angel to a _young_ man,  saying, \"Go speak to that _young_ man.\"    Now, sir, that you may be convinced beyond controversy, I will beg your  attention to the marvellous coincidence between the matter of fact, as  related by a guileless _young_ man, and the declaration of John and  Zechariah; but first, you must readily admit, that according to the  testimony of two prophets of God, an angel must come down through the  midst of heaven to earth, in _some_ period of the last days, subsequent  to the lifetime of John, with such a gospel as was not on the earth;  and that angel must communicate his gospel message to some certain  _young_ man which the finger of God should point out to the angel.    Now, was the young man Joseph _the_ man, or look we for another? His  testimony concerning the angel that he saw, and the message that he  received, if you will read it, coincides perfectly with what the two  prophets had long since declared should take place. He was, indeed, an  illiterate and obscure youth of seventeen, of humble parentage, from  the mountains of Vermont; but was he any less"]]]
