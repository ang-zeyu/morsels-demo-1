Analysis and Parsing.    +Model+.--        man   | will be honored   =========|==================    \\A  `   |         `          `       who ` | is \\ wise      -------|------------             |    +Explanation of the Diagram+.--You will notice that the lines standing for  the subject and predicate of the _independent clause_ are heavier than  those of the _dependent clause_. This pictures to you the relative  importance of the two clauses. You will see that the pronoun _who_ is  written on the subject line of the dependent clause. But this word performs  the office of a conjunction also, and this office is expressed in the  diagram by a dotted line. As all modifiers are joined by _slanting_ lines,  to the words they modify, you learn from this diagram that _who is wise_ is  a modifier of _man_.    +Oral Analysis+.--This is a _complex sentence_, because it consists of an  _independent clause_ and a _dependent clause_. _A man will be honored_ is  _the independent clause_; _who is wise_ is the _dependent clause_. _Man_ is  the subject of the independent clause; _will be honored_ is the predicate.  The word _A_ and the clause, _who is wise_, are modifiers of the subject.  _A_ points out _man_, and _who is wise_ tells the _kind_ of man. _A man who  is wise_ is the modified subject; the predicate is unmodified. _Who_ is the  subject of the dependent clause, _is_ is the predicate, and _wise_ is the  attribute complement. _Who_ connects the two clauses.    1. He that runs may read.  2. Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps.  3. Henry Hudson discovered the river which bears his name.  4. He necessarily remains weak who never tries exertion.  5. The meridians are those lines that extend from pole to pole.  6. He who will not be ruled by the rudder must be ruled by the rock.  7. Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates.  8. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.  9. The thick mists which prevail in the neighborhood of Newfoundland are     caused by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.  10. The power which brings a pin to the ground holds the earth in its      orbit.  11. Death is the black camel which kneels at every man's gate.  12. Our best friends are they who tell us of our faults, and help us to      mend them.    The pupil will notice that, in some of these sentences, the dependent  clause modifies the subject, and that, in others, it modifies the noun  complement.    +COMMA--RULE.--The _adjective_ or the _adverb clause_, when it does not  closely follow and restrict the word modified, is generally set off by the  comma+.          LESSON 58.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    ADJECTIVE CLAUSES.    Expand each of the following adjectives into    1. A phrase;  2. A clause;    and then use these three modifiers in three separate sentences of your own  construction.                                      | _who has energy_,  +Model+.--_Energetic; of energy_; +   or                                    | _who is energetic_.      An _energetic_ man will succeed. A man _of energy_ will succeed. A man who  has _energy_ (or _who is energetic_) will succeed.    Honest, long-eared, beautiful, wealthy.    Expand each of the following _possessive nouns_ into    1. A phrase;  2. A clause;    and then use these three modifiers in three separate sentences.    +Model+.--_Saturn's rings_; the rings _of Saturn_; the rings _which  surround Saturn_.    _Saturn's_ rings can be seen with a telescope. The _rings of Saturn_ can be  seen with a telescope. The rings _which surround Saturn_ can be seen, with  a telescope.    Absalom's hair; the hen's eggs; the elephant's tusks.    Change the following simple sentences into complex sentences by expanding  the participial phrases into clauses.    The vessels carrying the blood from the heart are called arteries.

LESSON 59.    COMPLEX SENTENCES.    THE ADVERB CLAUSE.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--You learned in Lesson 83 that an adverb can  be expanded into an equivalent phrase; as, The book was _carefully_ read =  The book was read _with care_.    We shall now learn that a phrase used as an adverb may be expanded into an  +Adverb clause+. In the sentence, _We started at sunrise_, what phrase is  used like an adverb? +P+.--_At sunrise_. +T+.--Expand this phrase into an  equivalent clause, and give me the entire sentence. +P+.--We started _when  the sun rose_.    +T+.--You see that the phrase, _at sunrise_, and the clause, _when the sun  rose_, both modify _started_, telling the time of starting, and are  therefore equivalent to adverbs. We will then call such clauses +Adverb  Clauses+.      Analysis and Parsing.    +Model.--+       We    |    started  =========|=============                   \\                    ` when               sun   \\  rose             =======|=========               \\the    +Explanation of the Diagram+.--The line which connects the two predicate  lines pictures three things. It is made up of three parts. The upper part  shows that _when_ modifies _started_; the lower part, that it modifies  _rose_; and the dotted part shows that it _connects_.    +Oral Analysis+.--This is a complex sentence, because ----; _We started_ is  the independent clause, and _when the sun rose_ is the dependent clause.  _We_ is the subject of the independent clause, and _started_ is the  predicate. The clause, _when the sun rose_, is a modifier of the predicate,  because it tells when we started. _Started when the sun rose_ is the  modified predicate.    _Sun_ is the subject of the dependent clause, and _rose_ is the predicate,  and the is a modifier of _sun_; _the sun_ is the modified subject. _When_  modifies _rose_ and _started_, and connects the clause-modifier to the  predicate _started_.    +Parsing+ of _when_.--_When_ is an adverb modifying the two verbs _started_  and _rose_, thus connecting the two clauses. It modifies these verbs by  showing that the two actions took place at the same time.    1. The dew glitters when the sun shines.  2. Printing was unknown when Homer wrote the Iliad.  3. Where the bee sucks honey, the spider sucks poison.  4. Ah! few shall part where many meet.  5. Where the devil cannot come, he will send.  6. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.  7. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.  8. When the tale of bricks is doubled, Moses comes.  9. When I look upon the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies     within me.  10. The upright man speaks as he thinks.  11. He died as the fool dieth.  12. The scepter shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh come.          LESSON 60.    SENTENCE-BUILDING.    ADVERB CLAUSES.    Expand each of the following phrases into an adverb clause, and fit this  clause into a sentence of your own building.    +Model+.--_At sunset; when the sun set_. We returned _when the sun set_.    At the hour; on the playground; by moonlight; in youth; among icebergs;  after school; at the forks of the road; during the day; before church; with  my friend.    To each of the following independent clauses, join an adverb clause,  and so make complex sentences.    ---- Peter began to sink. The man dies ----. Grass grows ----. Iron ----  can easily be shaped. The rattlesnake shakes his rattle ----. ---- a nation  mourns. Pittsburg stands ----. He dared to lead ----.    +To the Teacher+.--For additional composition exercises with particular  reference to adverb clauses, see Notes, p. 177.

What do astronomers teach?  +P+.--That stars are suns. +T+.--What is the object complement of _teach_?  +P+.--The clause, _that stars are suns_. +T+.--What office then does this  clause perform? +P+.--That of a noun.    +T+.--_The teaching of astronomers is, that stars are suns_. What does _is_  assert of teaching? +P+.--That stars are suns. +T+.--What then is the  attribute complement? +P+.--_That stars are suns_. +T+.--Does this  complement express the quality of the subject, or does it name the same  thing that the subject names? +P+.--It names the same thing that the  subject names. +T+.--It is equivalent then to what part of speech? +P+.--To  a noun.    +T+.--You see then that a clause, like a noun, may be used as the subject  or the complement of a sentence.

A few drops of vegetable juice recall to our  minds all the powerfulness and the fecundity of nature. On the barren  flank of a rock grows a tree with coriaceous and dry leaves. Its large  woody roots can scarcely penetrate into the stone. For several months  of the year not a single shower moistens its foliage. Its branches  appear dead and dried; but when the trunk is pierced there flows from  it a sweet and nourishing milk. It is at the rising of the sun that  this vegetable fountain is most abundant. The negroes and natives are  then seen hastening from all quarters, furnished with large bowls to  receive the milk, which grows yellow, and thickens at its surface.  Some empty their bowls under the tree itself; others carry the juice  home to their children.    In examining the physical properties of animal and vegetable products,  science displays them as closely linked together; but it strips them  of what is marvellous, and perhaps, therefore, of a part of their  charms. Nothing appears isolated; the chemical principles that were  believed to be peculiar to animals are found in plants; a common chain  links together all organic nature.    Long before chemists had recognized small portions of wax in the  pollen of flowers, the varnish of leaves, and the whitish dust of our  plums and grapes, the inhabitants of the Andes of Quindiu made tapers  with the thick layer of wax that covers the trunk of a palm-tree.* (*  Coroxylon andicola.) It is but a few years since we discovered, in  Europe, caseum, the basis of cheese, in the emulsion of almonds; yet  for ages past, in the mountains of the coast of Venezuela, the milk of  a tree, and the cheese separated from that vegetable milk, have been  considered as a salutary aliment. How are we to account for this  singular course in the development of knowledge? How have the  unlearned inhabitants of one hemisphere become cognizant of a fact  which, in the other, so long escaped the sagacity of the scientific?  It is because a small number of elements and principles differently  combined are spread through several families of plants; it is because  the genera and species of these natural families are not equally  distributed in the torrid, the frigid, and the temperate zones; it is  that tribes, excited by want, and deriving almost all their  subsistence from the vegetable kingdom, discover nutritive principles,  farinaceous and alimentary substances, wherever nature has deposited  them in the sap, the bark, the roots, or the fruits of vegetables.  That amylaceous fecula which the seeds of the cereal plants furnish in  all its purity, is found united with an acrid and sometimes even  poisonous juice, in the roots of the arums, the Tacca pinnatifida, and  the Jatropha manihot. The savage of America, like the savage of the  South Sea islands, has learned to dulcify the fecula, by pressing and  separating it from its juice. In the milk of plants, and in the milky  emulsions, matter extremely nourishing, albumen, caseum, and sugar,  are found mixed with caoutchouc and with deleterious and caustic  principles, such as morphine and hydrocyanic acid.* (* Opium contains  morphine, caoutchouc, etc.) These mixtures vary not only in the  different families, but also in the species which belong to the same  genus. Sometimes it is morphine or the narcotic principle, that  characterises the vegetable milk, as in some papaverous plants;  sometimes it is caoutchouc, as in the hevea and the castilloa;  sometimes albumen and caseum, as in the cow-tree.    The lactescent plants belong chiefly to the three families of the  euphorbiaceae, the urticeae, and the apocineae.* (* After these three  great families follow the papaveraceae, the chicoraceae, the  lobeliaceae, the campanulaceae, the sapoteae, and the cucurbitaceae.  The hydrocyanic acid is peculiar to the group of rosaceo-amygdalaceae.  In the monocotyledonous plants there is no milky juice; but the  perisperm of the palms, which yields such sweet and agreeable milky  emulsions, contains, no doubt, caseum. Of what nature is the milk of  mushrooms?) Since, on examining the distribution of vegetable forms  over the globe, we find that those three families are more numerous in  species in the low regions of the tropics, we must thence conclude,  that a very elevated temperature contributes to the elaboration of the  milky juices, to the formation of caoutchouc, albumen, and caseous  matter. The sap of the palo de vaca furnishes unquestionably the most  striking example of a vegetable milk in which the acrid and  deleterious principle is not united with albumen, caseum, and  caoutchouc: the genera euphorbia and asclepias, however, though  generally known for their caustic properties, already present us with  a few species, the juice of which is sweet and harmless. Such are the  Tabayba dulce of the Canary Islands, which we have already mentioned,*  (* Euphorbia balsamifera. The milky juice of the Cactus mamillaris is  equally sweet.) and the Asclepias lactifera of Ceylon. Burman relates  that, in the latter country, when cow's milk is wanting, the milk of  this asclepias is used; and that the ailments commonly prepared with  animal milk are boiled with its leaves. It may be possible, as  Decandolle has well observed, that the natives employ only the juice  that flows from the young plant, at a period when the acrid principle  is not yet developed. In fact, the first shoots of the apocyneous  plants are eaten in several countries.    I have endeavoured by these comparisons to bring into consideration,  under a more general point of view, the milky juices that circulate in  vegetables; and the milky emulsions that the fruits of the  amygdalaceous plants and palms yield. I may be permitted to add the  result of some experiments which I attempted to make on the juice of  the Carica papaya during my stay in the valleys of Aragua, though I  was then almost destitute of chemical tests. The juice has been since  examined by Vauquelin, and this celebrated chemist has very clearly  recognized the albumen and caseous matter; he compares the milky sap  to a substance strongly animalized--to the blood of animals; but his  researches were confined to a fermented juice and a coagulum of a  fetid smell, formed during the passage from the Mauritius to France.  He has expressed a wish that some traveller would examine the milk of  the papaw-tree just as it flows from the stem or the fruit.    The younger the fruit of the carica, the more milk it yields: it is  even found in the germen scarcely fecundated. In proportion as the  fruit ripens, the milk becomes less abundant, and more aqueous. Less  of that animal matter which is coagulable by acids and by the  absorption of atmospheric oxygen, is found in it. As the whole fruit  is viscous,* (* The same viscosity is also remarked in the fresh milk  of the palo de vaca. It is no doubt occasioned by the caoutchouc,  which is not yet separated, and which forms one mass with the albumen  and the caseum, as the butter and the caseum in animal milk. The juice  of a euphorbiaceous plant (Sapium aucuparium), which also yields  caoutchouc, is so glutinous that it is used to catch parrots.) it  might be supposed that, as it grows larger, the coagulable matter is  deposed in the organs, and forms a part of the pulp, or the fleshy  substance. When nitric acid, diluted with four parts of water, is  added drop by drop to the milk expressed from a very young fruit, a  very extraordinary phenomenon appears. At the centre of each drop a  gelatinous pellicle is formed, divided by greyish streaks. These  streaks are simply the juice rendered more aqueous, owing to the  contact of the acid having deprived it of the albumen. At the same  time, the centre of the pellicles becomes opaque, and of the colour of  the yolk of an egg; they enlarge as if by the prolongation of  divergent fibres. The whole liquid assumes at first the appearance of  an agate with milky clouds; and it seems as if organic membranes were  forming under the eye of the observer. When the coagulum extends to  the whole mass, the yellow spots again disappear. By agitation it  becomes granulous like soft cheese.* (* The substance which falls down  in grumous and filamentous clots is not pure caoutchouc, but perhaps a  mixture of this substance with caseum and albumen. Acids precipitate  the caoutchouc from the milky juice of the euphorbiums, fig-trees, and  hevea; they precipitate the caseum from the milk of animals. A white  coagulum was formed in phials closely stopped, containing the milk of  the hevea, and preserved among our collections, during our journey to  the Orinoco. It is perhaps the development of a vegetable acid which  then furnishes oxygen to the albumen. The formation of the coagulum of  the hevea, or of real caoutchouc, is nevertheless much more rapid in  contact with the air. The absorption of atmospheric oxygen is not in  the least necessary to the production of butter which exists already  formed in the milk of animals; but I believe it cannot be doubted  that, in the milk of plants, this absorption produces the pellicles of  caoutchouc, of coagulated albumen, and of caseum, which are  successively formed in vessels exposed to the open air.) The yellow  colour reappears on adding a few more drops of nitric acid. The acid  acts in this instance as the oxygen of the atmosphere at a temperature  from 27 to 35 degrees; for the white coagulum grows yellow in two or  three minutes, when exposed to the sun. After a few hours the yellow  colour turns to brown, no doubt because the carbon is set more free  progressively as the hydrogen, with which it was combined, is burnt.  The coagulum formed by the acid becomes viscous, and acquires that  smell of wax which I have observed in treating muscular flesh and  mushrooms (morels) with nitric acid.
