Nay, I come of no ungrateful stock, for all  the world knows, but particularly my own town, who the Panzas from whom I  am descended were; and, what is more, I know and have learned, by many  good words and deeds, your worship's desire to show me favour; and if I  have been bargaining more or less about my wages, it was only to please  my wife, who, when she sets herself to press a point, no hammer drives  the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants; but, after  all, a man must be a man, and a woman a woman; and as I am a man anyhow,  which I can't deny, I will be one in my own house too, let who will take  it amiss; and so there's nothing more to do but for your worship to make  your will with its codicil in such a way that it can't be provoked, and  let us set out at once, to save Senor Samson's soul from suffering, as he  says his conscience obliges him to persuade your worship to sally out  upon the world a third time; so I offer again to serve your worship  faithfully and loyally, as well and better than all the squires that  served knights-errant in times past or present.\"    The bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard Sancho's phraseology  and style of talk, for though he had read the first part of his master's  history he never thought that he could be so droll as he was there  described; but now, hearing him talk of a \"will and codicil that could  not be provoked,\" instead of \"will and codicil that could not be  revoked,\" he believed all he had read of him, and set him down as one of  the greatest simpletons of modern times; and he said to himself that two  such lunatics as master and man the world had never seen. In fine, Don  Quixote and Sancho embraced one another and made friends, and by the  advice and with the approval of the great Carrasco, who was now their  oracle, it was arranged that their departure should take place three days  thence, by which time they could have all that was requisite for the  journey ready, and procure a closed helmet, which Don Quixote said he  must by all means take. Samson offered him one, as he knew a friend of  his who had it would not refuse it to him, though it was more dingy with  rust and mildew than bright and clean like burnished steel.    The curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor  were past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and in  the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they raised a  lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as if it had  been his death. Samson's intention in persuading him to sally forth once  more was to do what the history relates farther on; all by the advice of  the curate and barber, with whom he had previously discussed the subject.  Finally, then, during those three days, Don Quixote and Sancho provided  themselves with what they considered necessary, and Sancho having  pacified his wife, and Don Quixote his niece and housekeeper, at  nightfall, unseen by anyone except the bachelor, who thought fit to  accompany them half a league out of the village, they set out for El  Toboso, Don Quixote on his good Rocinante and Sancho on his old Dapple,  his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals, and  his purse with money that Don Quixote gave him to meet emergencies.  Samson embraced him, and entreated him to let him hear of his good or  evil fortunes, so that he might rejoice over the former or condole with  him over the latter, as the laws of friendship required. Don Quixote  promised him he would do so, and Samson returned to the village, and the  other two took the road for the great city of El Toboso.          CHAPTER VIII.    WHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO SEE HIS LADY  DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO      \"Blessed be Allah the all-powerful!\" says Hamete Benengeli on beginning  this eighth chapter; \"blessed be Allah!\" he repeats three times; and he  says he utters these thanksgivings at seeing that he has now got Don  Quixote and Sancho fairly afield, and that the readers of his delightful  history may reckon that the achievements and humours of Don Quixote and  his squire are now about to begin; and he urges them to forget the former  chivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to fix their eyes on those that  are to come, which now begin on the road to El Toboso, as the others  began on the plains of Montiel; nor is it much that he asks in  consideration of all he promises, and so he goes on to say:    Don Quixote and Sancho were left alone, and the moment Samson took his  departure, Rocinante began to neigh, and Dapple to sigh, which, by both  knight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen;  though, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of Dapple were  louder than the neighings of the hack, from which Sancho inferred that  his good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his master, building,  perhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he may have known, though the  history says nothing about it; all that can be said is, that when he  stumbled or fell, he was heard to say he wished he had not come out, for  by stumbling or falling there was nothing to be got but a damaged shoe or  a broken rib; and, fool as he was, he was not much astray in this.    Said Don Quixote, \"Sancho, my friend, night is drawing on upon us as we  go, and more darkly than will allow us to reach El Toboso by daylight;  for there I am resolved to go before I engage in another adventure, and  there I shall obtain the blessing and generous permission of the peerless  Dulcinea, with which permission I expect and feel assured that I shall  conclude and bring to a happy termination every perilous adventure; for  nothing in life makes knights-errant more valorous than finding  themselves favoured by their ladies.\"    \"So I believe,\" replied Sancho; \"but I think it will be difficult for  your worship to speak with her or see her, at any rate where you will be  able to receive her blessing; unless, indeed, she throws it over the wall  of the yard where I saw her the time before, when I took her the letter  that told of the follies and mad things your worship was doing in the  heart of Sierra Morena.\"    \"Didst thou take that for a yard wall, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"where  or at which thou sawest that never sufficiently extolled grace and  beauty? It must have been the gallery, corridor, or portico of some rich  and royal palace.\"    \"It might have been all that,\" returned Sancho, \"but to me it looked like  a wall, unless I am short of memory.\"    \"At all events, let us go there, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"for, so that  I see her, it is the same to me whether it be over a wall, or at a  window, or through the chink of a door, or the grate of a garden; for any  beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will give light to my  reason and strength to my heart, so that I shall be unmatched and  unequalled in wisdom and valour.\"    \"Well, to tell the truth, senor,\" said Sancho, \"when I saw that sun of  the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, it was not bright enough to throw out beams  at all; it must have been, that as her grace was sifting that wheat I  told you of, the thick dust she raised came before her face like a cloud  and dimmed it.\"    \"What! dost thou still persist, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"in saying,  thinking, believing, and maintaining that my lady Dulcinea was sifting  wheat, that being an occupation and task entirely at variance with what  is and should be the employment of persons of distinction, who are  constituted and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that show  their rank a bowshot off? Thou hast forgotten, O Sancho, those lines of  our poet wherein he paints for us how, in their crystal abodes, those  four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved Tagus and  seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which  the ingenious poet there describes to us, how they were worked and woven  with gold and silk and pearls; and something of this sort must have been  the employment of my lady when thou sawest her, only that the spite which  some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of mine changes  all those things that give me pleasure, and turns them into shapes unlike  their own; and so I fear that in that history of my achievements which  they say is now in print, if haply its author was some sage who is an  enemy of mine, he will have put one thing for another, mingling a  thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself by relating  transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true  history. O envy, root of all countless evils, and cankerworm of the  virtues! All the vices, Sancho, bring some kind of pleasure with them;  but envy brings nothing but irritation, bitterness, and rage.\"    \"So I say too,\" replied Sancho; \"and I suspect in that legend or history  of us that the bachelor Samson Carrasco told us he saw, my honour goes  dragged in the dirt, knocked about, up and down, sweeping the streets, as  they say. And yet, on the faith of an honest man, I never spoke ill of  any enchanter, and I am not so well off that I am to be envied; to be  sure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice of the rogue in me; but  all is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity, always natural and  never acted; and if I had no other merit save that I believe, as I always  do, firmly and truly in God, and all the holy Roman Catholic Church holds  and believes, and that I am a mortal enemy of the Jews, the historians  ought to have mercy on me and treat me well in their writings. But let  them say what they like; naked was I born, naked I find myself, I neither  lose nor gain; nay,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#13)"],[1,"were Thorkatla Asgrim Ellidagrim's son's daughter,  and Njal's two daughters, Thorgerda and Helga.    Gunnar had already many guests to meet them, and he thus arranged  his men.  He sat on the middle of the bench, and on the inside,  away from him, Thrain Sigfus' son, then Wolf Aurpriest, then  Valgard the Guileful, then Mord and Runolf, then the other sons  of Sigfus, Lambi sat outermost of them.    Next to Gunnar on the outside, away from him, sat Njal, then  Skarphedinn, then Helgi, then Grim, then Hauskuld Njal's son,  then Hafr the Wise, then Ingialld from the Springs, then the sons  of Thorir from Holt away east.  Thorir would sit outermost of the  men of mark, for every one was pleased with the seat he got.    Hauskuld, the bride's father, sat on the middle of the bench over  against Gunnar, but his sons sat on the inside away from him;  Hrut sat on the outside away from Hauskuld, but it is not said  how the others were placed.  The bride sat in the middle of the  cross bench on the dais; but on one hand of her sat her daughter  Thorgerda, and on the other Thorkatla Asgrim Ellidagrim's son's  daughter.    Thorhillda went about waiting on the guests, and Bergthora bore  the meat on the board.    Now Thrain Sigfus' son kept staring at Thorgerda Glum's daughter;  his wife Thorhillda saw this, and she got wroth, and made a  couplet upon him.    \"Thrain,\" she says,         \"Gaping mouths are no wise good,       Goggle eyne are in thy head.\"    He rose at once up from the board, and said he would put  Thorhillda away.  \"I will not bear her jibes and jeers any  longer;\" and he was so quarrelsome about this, that he would not  be at the feast unless she were driven away.  And so it was, that  she went away; and now each man sat in his place, and they drank  and were glad.    Then Thrain began to speak, \"I will not whisper about that which  is in my mind.  This I will ask thee, Hauskuld Dalakoll's son,  wilt thou give me to wife Thorgerda, thy kinswoman?\"    \"I do not know that,\" says Hauskuld; \"methinks thou art ill  parted from the one thou hadst before.  But what kind of man is  he, Gunnar?\"    Gunnar answers, \"I will not say aught about the man, because he  is near of kin; but say thou about him, Njal,\" says Gunnar, \"for  all men will believe it.\"    Njal spoke, and said, \"That is to be said of this man, that the  man is well to do for wealth, and a proper man in all things.  A  man, too, of the greatest mark; so that ye may well make this  match with him.\"    Then Hauskuld spoke, \"What thinkest thou we ought to do, kinsman  Hrut?\"    \"Thou mayst make the match, because it is an even one for her,\"  says Hrut.    Then they talk about the terms of the bargain, and are soon of  one mind on all points.    Then Gunnar stands up, and Thrain too, and they go to the cross  bench.  Gunnar asked that mother and daughter whether they would  say yes to this bargain.  They said they would find no fault with  it, and Hallgerda betrothed her daughter.  Then the places of the  women were shifted again, and now Thorhalla sate between the  brides.  And now the feast sped on well, and when it was over,  Hauskuld and his company ride west, but the men of Rangriver rode  to their own abode.  Gunnar gave many men gifts, and that made  him much liked.    Hallgerda took the housekeeping under her, and stood up for her  rights in word and deed.  Thorgerda took to housekeeping at  Gritwater, and was a good housewife.        35. THE VISIT TO BERGTHORSKNOLL    Now it was the custom between Gunnar and Njal, that each made the  other a feast, winter and winter about, for friendship's sake;  and it was Gunnar's turn to go to feast at Njal's.  So Gunnar and  Hallgerda set off for Bergthorsknoll, and when they got there  Helgi and his wife were not at home.  Njal gave Gunnar and his  wife a hearty welcome, and when they had been there a little  while, Helgi came home with Thorhalla his wife.  Then Bergthora  went up to the crossbench, and Thorhalla with her, and Bergthora  said to Hallgerda, \"Thou shalt give place to this woman.\"    She answered, \"To no one will I give place, for I will not be  driven into the corner for any one.\"    \"I shall rule here,\" said Bergthora.  After that Thorhalla sat  down, and Bergthora went round the table with water to wash the  guests' hands.  Then Hallgerda took hold of Bergthora's hand, and  said, \"There's not much to choose, though, between you two.  Thou  hast hangnails on every finger, and Njal is beardless.\"    \"That's true,\" says Bergthora, \"yet neither of us finds fault  with the other for it; but Thorwald, thy husband, was not  beardless, and yet thou plottedst his death.\"    Then Hallgerda said, \"It stands me in little stead to have the  bravest man in Iceland if thou dost not avenge this, Gunnar!\"    He sprang up and strode across away from the board, and said,  \"Home I will go, and it were more seemly that thou shouldest  wrangle with those of thine own household, and not under other  men's roofs; but as for Njal, I am his debtor for much honour,  and never will I be egged on by thee like a fool.\"    After that they set off home.    \"Mind this Bergthora,\" said Hallgerda, \"that we shall meet  again.\"    Bergthora said she should not be better off for that.  Gunnar  said nothing at all, but went home to Lithend, and was there at  home all the winter.  And now the summer was running on towards  the Great Thing.        36. KOL SLEW SWART    Gunnar rode away to the Thing, but before he rode from home he  said to Hallgerda, \"Be good now while I am away, and show none of  thine ill temper in anything with which my friends have to do.\"    \"The trolls take thy friends,\" says Hallgerda.    So Gunnar rode to the Thing, and saw it was not good to come to  words with her.  Njal rode to the Thing too, and all his sons  with him.    Now it must be told of what tidings happened at home.  Njal and  Gunnar owned a wood in common at Redslip; they had not shared the  wood, but each was wont to hew in it as he needed, and neither  said a word to the other about that.  Hallgerda's grieve's (1)  name was Kol; he had been with her long, and was one of the worst  of men.  There was a man named Swart; he was Njal's and  Bergthora's housecarle; they were very fond of him.  Now  Bergthora told him that he must go up into Redslip and hew wood;  but she said, \"I will get men to draw home the wood.\"    He said he would do the work she set him to win; and so he went  up into Redslip, and was to be there a week.    Some gangrel men came to Lithend from the east across Markfleet,  and said that Swart had been in Redslip, and hewn wood, and done  a deal of work.    \"So,\" says Hallgerda, \"Bergthora must mean to rob me in many  things, but I'll take care that he does not hew again.\"    Rannveig, Gunnar's mother, heard that, and said, \"There have been  good housewives before now, though they never set their hearts on  manslaughter.\"    Now the night wore away, and early next morning Hallgerda came to  speak to Kol, and said, \"I have thought of some work for thee;\"  and with that she put weapons into his hands, and went on to say  -- \"Fare thou to Redslip; there wilt thou find Swart.\"    \"What shall I do to him?\" he says.    \"Askest thou that, when thou art the worst of men?\" she says.  \"Thou shalt kill him.\"    \"I can get that done,\" he says, \"but 'tis more likely that I  shall lose my own life for it.\"    \"Everything grows big in thy eyes,\" she says, \"and thou behavest  ill to say this after I have spoken up for thee in everything.  I  must get another man to do this if thou darest not.\"    He took the axe, and was very wroth, and takes a horse that  Gunnar owned, and rides now till he comes east of Markfleet.  There he got off and bided in the wood, till they had carried  down the firewood, and Swart was left alone behind.  Then Kol  sprang on him, and said, \"More folk can hew great strokes than  thou alone;\" and so he laid the axe on his head, and smote him  his death-blow, and rides home afterwards, and tells Hallgerda of  the slaying.    She said, \"I shall take such good care of thee, that no harm  shall come to thee.\"    \"May be so,\" says he, \"but I dreamt all the other way as I slept  ere I did the deed.\"    Now they come up into the wood, and find Swart slain, and bear  him home.  Hallgerda sent a man to Gunnar at the Thing to tell  him of the slaying.  Gunnar said no hard words at first of  Hallgerda to the messenger, and men knew not at first whether he  thought well or ill of it.  A little after he stood up, and bade  his men go with him: they did so, and fared to Njal's booth.  Gunnar sent a man to fetch Njal, and begged him to come out.  Njal went out at once, and he and Gunnar fell a-talking, and  Gunnar said, \"I have to tell thee of the slaying of a man, and my  wife and my grieve Kol were those who did it; but Swart, thy  housecarle, fell before them.\"    Njal held his peace while he told him the whole story.  Then Njal  spoke, \"Thou must take heed not to let her have her way in  everything.\"    Gunnar said, \"Thou thyself shalt settle the terms.\"    Njal spoke again, \"'Twill be hard work for thee to atone for all  Hallgerda's mischief; and somewhere else there will be a broader  trail to follow than this which we two now have a share in, and  yet, even here there will be much awanting before all be well;  and herein we shall need to bear in mind the friendly words that  passed between us of old; and something tells me that thou wilt  come well out of it, but still thou wilt be sore tried.\"    Then Njal took the award into his own hands from Gunnar, and  said, \"I will not push this matter to the uttermost; thou shalt  pay twelve ounces of silver; but I will add this to my award,  that if anything happens from our homestead about which thou hast  to utter an award, thou wilt not be less easy in thy terms.\"    Gunnar paid up the money out of hand, and rode home afterwards.  Njal, too, came home from the Thing, and"]]]
