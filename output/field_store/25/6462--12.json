[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/754"],[0,"The Story of Mankind (#13)"],[1,"by a small but exceedingly powerful  group of rich men, The Greek word for rich is \"ploutos\" and the Greeks  called such a government by \"rich men\" a \"Plutocracy.\" Carthage was a  plutocracy and the real power of the state lay in the hands of a dozen  big ship-owners and mine-owners and merchants who met in the back  room of an office and regarded their common Fatherland as a business  enterprise which ought to yield them a decent profit. They were however  wide awake and full of energy and worked very hard.    As the years went by the influence of Carthage upon her neighbours  increased until the greater part of the African coast, Spain and certain  regions of France were Carthaginian possessions, and paid tribute, taxes  and dividends to the mighty city on the African Sea.    Of course, such a \"plutocracy\" was forever at the mercy of the crowd.  As long as there was plenty of work and wages were high, the majority of  the citizens were quite contented, allowed their \"betters\" to rule them  and asked no embarrassing questions. But when no ships left the harbor,  when no ore was brought to the smelting-ovens, when dockworkers and  stevedores were thrown out of employment, then there were grumblings and  there was a demand that the popular assembly be called together as in  the olden days when Carthage had been a self-governing republic.    To prevent such an occurrence the plutocracy was obliged to keep the  business of the town going at full speed. They had managed to do this  very successfully for almost five hun-dred years when they were greatly  disturbed by certain rumors which reached them from the western coast of  Italy. It was said that a little village on the banks of the Tiber had  suddenly risen to great power and was making itself the acknowledged  leader of all the Latin tribes who inhabited central Italy. It was also  said that this village, which by the way was called Rome, intended to  build ships and go after the commerce of Sicily and the southern coast  of France.    Carthage could not possibly tolerate such competition. The young rival  must be destroyed lest the Carthaginian rulers lose their prestige as  the absolute rulers of the western Mediterranean. The rumors were duly  investigated and in a general way these were the facts that came to  light.    The west coast of Italy had long been neglected by civilisation. Whereas  in Greece all the good harbours faced eastward and enjoyed a full view  of the busy islands of the AEgean, the west coast of Italy contemplated  nothing more exciting than the desolate waves of the Mediterranean. The  country was poor. It was therefore rarely visited by foreign merchants  and the natives were allowed to live in undisturbed possession of their  hills and their marshy plains.    The first serious invasion of this land came from the north. At an  unknown date certain Indo-European tribes had managed to find their way  through the passes of the Alps and had pushed southward until they  had filled the heel and the toe of the famous Italian boot with their  villages and their flocks. Of these early conquerors we know nothing.  No Homer sang their glory. Their own accounts of the foundation of Rome  (written eight hundred years later when the little city had become the  centre of an Empire) are fairy stories and do not belong in a history.  Romulus and Remus jumping across each other's walls (I always forget who  jumped across whose wall) make entertaining reading, but the foundation  of the City of Rome was a much more prosaic affair. Rome began as a  thousand American cities have done, by being a convenient place for  barter and horse-trading. It lay in the heart of the plains of central  Italy The Tiber provided direct access to the sea. The land-road from  north to south found here a convenient ford which could be used all the  year around. And seven little hills along the banks of the river offered  the inhabitants a safe shelter against their enemies who lived in the  mountains and those who lived beyond the horizon of the nearby sea.    The mountaineers were called the Sabines. They were a rough crowd with  an unholy desire for easy plunder. But they were very backward. They  used stone axes and wooden shields and were no match for the Romans  with their steel swords. The sea-people on the other hand were dangerous  foes. They were called the Etruscans and they were (and still are) one  of the great mysteries of history. Nobody knew (or knows) whence they  came; who they were; what had driven them away from their original  homes. We have found the remains of their cities and their cemeteries  and their waterworks all along the Italian coast. We are familiar with  their inscriptions. But as no one has ever been able to decipher the  Etruscan alphabet, these written messages are, so far, merely annoying  and not at all useful.    Our best guess is that the Etruscans came originally from Asia Minor and  that a great war or a pestilence in that country had forced them to  go away and seek a new home elsewhere. Whatever the reason for their  coming, the Etruscans played a great role in history. They carried the  pollen of the ancient civilisation from the east to the west and they  taught the Romans who, as we know, came from the north, the first  principles of architecture and street-building and fighting and art and  cookery and medicine and astronomy.    But just as the Greeks had not loved their AEgean teachers, in this same  way did the Romans hate their Etruscan masters. They got rid of them  as soon as they could and the opportunity offered itself when Greek  merchants discovered the commercial possibilities of Italy and when the  first Greek vessels reached Rome. The Greeks came to trade, but they  stayed to instruct. They found the tribes who inhabited the Roman  country-side (and who were called the Latins) quite willing to learn  such things as might be of practical use. At once they understood the  great benefit that could be derived from a written alphabet and  they copied that of the Greeks. They also understood the commercial  advantages of a well-regulated system of coins and measures and weights.  Eventually the Romans swallowed Greek civilisation hook, line and  sinker.    They even welcomed the Gods of the Greeks to their country. Zeus was  taken to Rome where he became known as Jupiter and the other divinities  followed him. The Roman Gods however never were quite like their  cheerful cousins who had accompanied the Greeks on their road through  life and through history. The Roman Gods were State Functionaries. Each  one managed his own department with great prudence and a deep sense  of justice, but in turn he was exact in demanding the obedience of his  worshippers. This obedience the Romans rendered with scrupulous care.  But they never established the cordial personal relations and that  charming friendship which had existed between the old Hellenes and the  mighty residents of the high Olympian peak.    The Romans did not imitate the Greek form of government, but being of  the same Indo-European stock as the people of Hellas, the early history  of Rome resembles that of Athens and the other Greek cities. They did  not find it difficult to get rid of their kings, the descendants of the  ancient tribal chieftains. But once the kings had been driven from the  city, the Romans were forced to bridle the power of the nobles, and it  took many centuries before they managed to establish a system which gave  every free citizen of Rome a chance to take a personal interest in the  affairs of his town.    Thereafter the Romans enjoyed one great advantage over the Greeks. They  managed the affairs of their country without making too many speeches.  They were less imaginative than the Greeks and they preferred an ounce  of action to a pound of words. They understood the tendency of the  multitude (the \"plebe,\" as the assemblage of free citizens was called)  only too well to waste valuable time upon mere talk. They therefore  placed the actual business of running the city into the hands of two  \"consuls\" who were assisted by a council of Elders, called the Senate  (because the word \"senex\" means an old man). As a matter of custom and  practical advantage the senators were elected from the nobility. But  their power had been strictly defined.    Rome at one time had passed through the same sort of struggle between  the poor and the rich which had forced Athens to adopt the laws of Draco  and Solon. In Rome this conflict had occurred in the fifth century B.  C. As a result the freemen had obtained a written code of laws which  protected them against the despotism of the aristocratic judges by the  institution of the \"Tribune.\" These Tribunes were city-magistrates,  elected by the freemen. They had the right to protect any citizen  against those actions of the government officials which were thought to  be unjust. A consul had the right to condemn a man to death, but if the  case had not been absolutely proved the Tribune could interfere and save  the poor fellow's life.    But when I use the word Rome, I seem to refer to a little city of a few  thousand inhabitants. And the real strength of Rome lay in the country  districts outside her walls. And it was in the government of these  outlying provinces that Rome at an early age showed her wonderful gift  as a colonising power.    In very early times Rome had been the only strongly fortified city in  central Italy, but it had always offered a hospitable refuge to  other Latin tribes who happened to be in danger of attack. The Latin  neighbours had recognised the advantages of a close union with such  a powerful friend and they had tried to find a basis for some sort of  defensive and offensive alliance. Other nations, Egyptians, Babylonians,  Phoenicians, even Greeks, would have insisted upon a treaty of  submission on the part of the \"barbarians,\" The Romans did nothing of  the sort. They"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766"],[0,"David Copperfield (#13)"],[1," any of the neighbours call to mind, as I do, how we used to  walk home together, she and I; and I wonder stupidly about that, all the  dreary dismal day.    There had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding-school.  Mr. and Miss Murdstone had originated it, and my mother had of course  agreed with them. Nothing, however, was concluded on the subject yet.  In the meantime, I learnt lessons at home. Shall I ever forget those  lessons! They were presided over nominally by my mother, but really by  Mr. Murdstone and his sister, who were always present, and found them  a favourable occasion for giving my mother lessons in that miscalled  firmness, which was the bane of both our lives. I believe I was kept  at home for that purpose. I had been apt enough to learn, and willing  enough, when my mother and I had lived alone together. I can faintly  remember learning the alphabet at her knee. To this day, when I look  upon the fat black letters in the primer, the puzzling novelty of their  shapes, and the easy good-nature of O and Q and S, seem to present  themselves again before me as they used to do. But they recall no  feeling of disgust or reluctance. On the contrary, I seem to have walked  along a path of flowers as far as the crocodile-book, and to have been  cheered by the gentleness of my mother's voice and manner all the  way. But these solemn lessons which succeeded those, I remember as the  death-blow of my peace, and a grievous daily drudgery and misery. They  were very long, very numerous, very hard--perfectly unintelligible,  some of them, to me--and I was generally as much bewildered by them as I  believe my poor mother was herself.    Let me remember how it used to be, and bring one morning back again.    I come into the second-best parlour after breakfast, with my books,  and an exercise-book, and a slate. My mother is ready for me at her  writing-desk, but not half so ready as Mr. Murdstone in his easy-chair  by the window (though he pretends to be reading a book), or as Miss  Murdstone, sitting near my mother stringing steel beads. The very sight  of these two has such an influence over me, that I begin to feel the  words I have been at infinite pains to get into my head, all sliding  away, and going I don't know where. I wonder where they do go, by the  by?    I hand the first book to my mother. Perhaps it is a grammar, perhaps a  history, or geography. I take a last drowning look at the page as I give  it into her hand, and start off aloud at a racing pace while I have  got it fresh. I trip over a word. Mr. Murdstone looks up. I trip  over another word. Miss Murdstone looks up. I redden, tumble over  half-a-dozen words, and stop. I think my mother would show me the book  if she dared, but she does not dare, and she says softly:    'Oh, Davy, Davy!'    'Now, Clara,' says Mr. Murdstone, 'be firm with the boy. Don't say, \"Oh,  Davy, Davy!\" That's childish. He knows his lesson, or he does not know  it.'    'He does NOT know it,' Miss Murdstone interposes awfully.    'I am really afraid he does not,' says my mother.    'Then, you see, Clara,' returns Miss Murdstone, 'you should just give  him the book back, and make him know it.'    'Yes, certainly,' says my mother; 'that is what I intend to do, my dear  Jane. Now, Davy, try once more, and don't be stupid.'    I obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more, but am  not so successful with the second, for I am very stupid. I tumble down  before I get to the old place, at a point where I was all right before,  and stop to think. But I can't think about the lesson. I think of the  number of yards of net in Miss Murdstone's cap, or of the price of Mr.  Murdstone's dressing-gown, or any such ridiculous problem that I have  no business with, and don't want to have anything at all to do with. Mr.  Murdstone makes a movement of impatience which I have been expecting  for a long time. Miss Murdstone does the same. My mother glances  submissively at them, shuts the book, and lays it by as an arrear to be  worked out when my other tasks are done.    There is a pile of these arrears very soon, and it swells like a rolling  snowball. The bigger it gets, the more stupid I get. The case is so  hopeless, and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense, that  I give up all idea of getting out, and abandon myself to my fate. The  despairing way in which my mother and I look at each other, as I blunder  on, is truly melancholy. But the greatest effect in these miserable  lessons is when my mother (thinking nobody is observing her) tries  to give me the cue by the motion of her lips. At that instant, Miss  Murdstone, who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along, says  in a deep warning voice:    'Clara!'    My mother starts, colours, and smiles faintly. Mr. Murdstone comes out  of his chair, takes the book, throws it at me or boxes my ears with it,  and turns me out of the room by the shoulders.    Even when the lessons are done, the worst is yet to happen, in the shape  of an appalling sum. This is invented for me, and delivered to me orally  by Mr. Murdstone, and begins, 'If I go into a cheesemonger's shop, and  buy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-halfpenny each,  present payment'--at which I see Miss Murdstone secretly overjoyed.  I pore over these cheeses without any result or enlightenment until  dinner-time, when, having made a Mulatto of myself by getting the dirt  of the slate into the pores of my skin, I have a slice of bread to help  me out with the cheeses, and am considered in disgrace for the rest of  the evening.    It seems to me, at this distance of time, as if my unfortunate studies  generally took this course. I could have done very well if I had been  without the Murdstones; but the influence of the Murdstones upon me was  like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird. Even when  I did get through the morning with tolerable credit, there was not  much gained but dinner; for Miss Murdstone never could endure to see me  untasked, and if I rashly made any show of being unemployed, called her  brother's attention to me by saying, 'Clara, my dear, there's nothing  like work--give your boy an exercise'; which caused me to be clapped  down to some new labour, there and then. As to any recreation with other  children of my age, I had very little of that; for the gloomy theology  of the Murdstones made all children out to be a swarm of little vipers  (though there WAS a child once set in the midst of the Disciples), and  held that they contaminated one another.    The natural result of this treatment, continued, I suppose, for some six  months or more, was to make me sullen, dull, and dogged. I was not  made the less so by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and  alienated from my mother. I believe I should have been almost stupefied  but for one circumstance.    It was this. My father had left a small collection of books in a little  room upstairs, to which I had access (for it adjoined my own) and which  nobody else in our house ever troubled. From that blessed little room,  Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Clinker, Tom Jones, the  Vicar of Wakefield, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, and Robinson Crusoe, came  out, a glorious host, to keep me company. They kept alive my fancy, and  my hope of something beyond that place and time,--they, and the Arabian  Nights, and the Tales of the Genii,--and did me no harm; for whatever  harm was in some of them was not there for me; I knew nothing of it. It  is astonishing to me now, how I found time, in the midst of my porings  and blunderings over heavier themes, to read those books as I did. It  is curious to me how I could ever have consoled myself under my  small troubles (which were great troubles to me), by impersonating my  favourite characters in them--as I did--and by putting Mr. and Miss  Murdstone into all the bad ones--which I did too. I have been Tom Jones  (a child's Tom Jones, a harmless creature) for a week together. I have  sustained my own idea of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch, I  verily believe. I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages and  Travels--I forget what, now--that were on those shelves; and for days  and days I can remember to have gone about my region of our house,  armed with the centre-piece out of an old set of boot-trees--the perfect  realization of Captain Somebody, of the Royal British Navy, in danger of  being beset by savages, and resolved to sell his life at a great price.  The Captain never lost dignity, from having his ears boxed with the  Latin Grammar. I did; but the Captain was a Captain and a hero, in  despite of all the grammars of all the languages in the world, dead or  alive.    This was my only and my constant comfort. When I think of it, the  picture always rises in my mind, of a summer evening, the boys at play  in the churchyard, and I sitting on my bed, reading as if for life.  Every barn in the neighbourhood, every stone in the church, and every  foot of the churchyard, had some association of its own, in my mind,  connected with these books, and stood for some locality made famous in  them. I have seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple; I have  watched Strap, with the knapsack on his back, stopping to rest himself  upon the wicket-gate; and I know that Commodore Trunnion held that club  with Mr. Pickle, in the parlour of our little village alehouse.    The reader now understands, as well as I do, what I was when I came to  that point of my youthful history to which I am now coming again.    One morning when I went into the parlour with my books, I found my  mother looking anxious, Miss Murdstone looking firm, and Mr. Murdstone  binding something round the bottom of a cane--a lithe and limber cane,  which he left off binding when I came in, and poised and switched in the  air.    'I tell you, Clara,' said Mr. Murdstone, 'I have been often flogged"]]]
