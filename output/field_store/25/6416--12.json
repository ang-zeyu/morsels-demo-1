Now, against two wrongs,  Let me defend two victims: first, the Church  Whom many have vilified for my master's doom;  And second, Galileo, whom they reproach  Because they think that in his blind old age  He might with one great eagle's glance have cowed  His judges, played the hero, raised his hands  Above his head, and posturing like a mummer  Cried (as one empty rumour now declares)  After his recantation--_yet, it moves_!  Out of this wild confusion, fourfold wrongs  Are heaped on both sides.--I would fain bring peace,  The peace of truth to both before I die;  And, as I hope, rest at my master's feet.  It was not Rome that tried to murder truth;  But the blind hate and vanity of man.  Had Galileo but concealed the smile  With which, like Socrates, he answered fools,  They would not, in the name of Christ, have mixed  This hemlock in his chalice.                               O pitiful  Pitiful human hearts that must deny  Their own unfolding heavens, for one light word  Twisted by whispering malice.                                Did he mean  Simplicio, in his dialogues, for the Pope?  Doubtful enough--the name was borrowed straight  From older dialogues.                        If he gave one thought  Of Urban's to Simplicio--you know well  How composite are all characters in books,  How authors find their colours here and there,  And paint both saints and villains from themselves.  No matter. This was Urban. Make it clear.  Simplicio means a simpleton. The saints  Are aroused by ridicule to most human wrath.  Urban was once his friend. This hint of ours  Kills all of that. And so we mortals close  The doors of Love and Knowledge on the world.  And so, for many an age, the name of Christ  Has been misused by man to mask man's hate.  How should the Church escape, then? I who loved  My master, know he had no truer friend  Than many of those true servants of the Church,  Fathers and priests who, in their lowlier sphere,  Moved nearer than her cardinals to the Christ.  These were the very Rome, and held her keys.  Those who charge Rome with hatred of the light  Would charge the sun with darkness, and accuse  This dome of sky for all the blood-red wrongs  That men commit beneath it. Art and song  That found her once in Europe their sole shrine  And sanctuary absolve her from that stain.    But there's this other charge against my friend,  And master, Galileo. It is brought  By friends, made sharper by their pity and grief,  The charge that he refused his martyrdom  And so denied his own high faith.                                    Whose faith,--  His friends', his Protestant followers', or his own?  Faced by the torture, that sublime old man  Was still a faithful Catholic, and his thought  Plunged deeper than his Protestant followers knew.  His aim was not to strike a blow at Rome  But to confound his enemies. He believed  As humbly as Castelli or Celeste  That there is nothing absolute but that Power  With which his Church confronted him. To this  He bowed his head, acknowledging that his light  Was darkness; but affirming, all the more,  That Ptolemy's light was even darker yet.  Read your own Protestant Milton, who derived  His mighty argument from my master's lips:  _\"Whether the sun predominant in heaven  Rise on the earth, or earth rise on the sun;  Leave them to God above; Him serve and fear.\"_  Just as in boyhood, when my master watched  The swinging lamp in the cathedral there  At Pisa; and, by one finger on his pulse,  Found that, although the great bronze miracle swung  Through ever-shortening spaces, yet it moved  More slowly, and so still swung in equal times;  He straight devised another boon to man,  Those pulse-clocks which by many a fevered bed  Our doctors use; dreamed of that timepiece, too,  Whose punctual swinging pendulum on earth  Measures the starry periods, and to-day  Talks peacefully to children by the fire  Like an old grandad full of ancient tales,  Remembering endless ages, and foretelling  Eternities to come; but, all the while  There, in the dim cathedral, he knew well,  That dreaming youngster, with his tawny mane  Of red-gold hair, and deep ethereal eyes,  What odorous clouds of incense round him rose;  Was conscious in the dimness, of great throngs  Kneeling around him; shared in his own heart  The music and the silence and the cry,  _O, salutaris hostia!_--so now,  There was no mortal conflict in his mind  Between his dream-clocks and things absolute,  And one far voice, most absolute of all,  Feeble with suffering, calling night and day  \"_Return, return_;\" the voice of his Celeste.  All these things co-existed, and the less  Were comprehended, like the swinging lamp,  Within that great cathedral of his soul.  Often he bade me, in that desolate house  _Il Giojello_, of old a jewel of light,  Read to him one sad letter, till he knew  The most of it by heart, and while he walked  His garden, leaning on my arm, at times  I think he quite forgot that I was there;  For he would quietly murmur it to himself,  As if she had sent it, half an hour ago:  \"Now, with this little winter's gift of fruit  I send you, father, from our southward wall,  Our convent's rarest flower, a Christmas rose.  At this cold season, it should please you much,  Seeing how rare it is; but, with the rose,  You must accept its thorns, which bring to mind  Our Lord's own bitter Passion. Its green leaves  Image the hope that through His Passion we,  After this winter of our mortal life,  May find the beauty of an eternal spring  In heaven.\"  Praise me the martyr, out of whose agonies  Some great new hope is born, but not the fool  Who starves his heart to prove what eyes can see  And intellect confirm throughout the world.  Why must he follow the idiot schoolboy code,  Torture his soul to reinforce the sight  Of those that closed their eyes and would not see.  To your own men of science, fifty turns  Of the thumbscrew would not prove that earth revolved.  Call it Italian subtlety if you will,  I say his intricate cause could not be won  By blind heroics. Much that his enemies challenged  Was not yet wholly proven, though his mind  Had leapt to a certainty. He must leave the rest  To those that should come after, swift and young,--  Those runners with the torch for whom he longed  As his deliverers. Had he chosen death  Before his hour, his proofs had been obscured  For many a year. His respite gave him time  To push new pawns out, in the blindfold play  Of those last months, and checkmate, not the Church  But those that hid behind her. He believed  His truth was all harmonious with her own.  How could he choose between them? Must he die  To affirm a discord that himself denied?  On many a point, he was less sure than we:  But surer far of much that we forget  The movements that he saw he could but judge  By some fixed point in space. He chose the sun.  Could this be absolute? Could he then be sure  That this great sun did not with all its worlds  Move round a deeper centre? What became  Of your Copernicus then? Could he be sure  Of any unchanging centre, whence to judge  This myriad-marching universe, but one--  The absolute throne of God.                              Affirming this  Eternal Rock, his own uncertainties  Became more certain, and although his lips  Breathed not a syllable of it, though he stood  Silent as earth that also seemed so still,  The very silence thundered, _yet it moves_!    He held to what he knew, secured his work  Through feeble hands like mine, in other lands,  Not least in England, as I think you know.  For, partly through your poet, as I believe,  When his great music rolled upon your skies,  New thoughts were kindled in the general mind.  'Twas at Arcetri that your Milton gained  The first great glimpse of his celestial realm.  Picture him,--still a prisoner of our light,  Closing his glorious eyes--that in the dark,  He might behold this wheeling universe,--  The planets gilding their ethereal horns  With sun-fire. Many a pure immortal phrase  In his own work, as I have pondered it,  Lived first upon the lips of him whose eyes  Were darkened first,--in whom, too, Milton found  That Samson Agonistes, not himself,  As many have thought, but my dear master dead.  These are a part of England's memories now,  The music blown upon her sea-bright air  When, in the year of Galileo's death,  Newton, the mightiest of the sons of light,  Was born to lift the splendour of this torch  And carry it, as I heard that Tycho said  Long since to Kepler, \"carry it out of sight,  Into the great new age I must not know,  Into the great new realm I must not tread.\"          V    NEWTON      I      If I saw farther, 'twas because I stood  On giant shoulders,\" wrote the king of thought,  Too proud of his great line to slight the toils  Of his forebears. He turned to their dim past,  Their fading victories and their fond defeats,  And knelt as at an altar, drawing all  Their strengths into his own; and so went forth  With all their glory shining in his face,  To win new victories for the age to come.  So, where Copernicus had destroyed the dream  We called our world; where Galileo watched  Those ancient firmaments melt, a thin blue smoke  Into a vaster night; where Kepler heard  Only stray fragments, isolated chords  Of that tremendous music which should bind  All things anew in one, Newton arose  And carried on their fire.                             Around him reeled  Through lingering fumes of hate and clouds of doubt,  Lit by the afterglow of the Civil War,  The dissolute throngs of that Walpurgis night  Where all the cynical spirits that deny  Danced with the vicious lusts that drown the soul  In flesh "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6585"],[0,"The Works of Lucian of Samosata — Volume 02 (#13)"],[1,"sacred one, is not yet clear. It is absolutely impossible to know  which man to accuse of sacrilege; even if all the objects were similar,  it would be uncertain who had robbed the God; for such things may be  private property too. Our perplexity, of course, is simply due to the  fact that the missing cup--assume it to be a cup--has no inscription; if  either the God's or the donor's name had been on it, we should not have  had all this trouble; when we found the inscribed one, we should have  stopped stripping and inconveniencing other visitors. I suppose,  Hermotimus, you have often been at athletic meetings?    _Her_. You suppose right; and in many places too.    _Ly_. Did you ever have a seat close by the judges?    _Her_. Dear me, yes; last Olympia, I was on the left of the stewards;  Euandridas of Elis had got me a place in the Elean enclosure; I  particularly wanted to have a near view of how things are done there.    _Ly_. So you know how they arrange ties for the wrestling or the  pancratium?    _Her_. Yes.    _Ly_. Then you will describe it better than I, as you have seen it  so close.    _Her_. In old days, when Heracles presided, bay leaves--    _Ly_. No old days, thank you; tell me what you saw with your own  eyes.    _Her_. A consecrated silver urn is produced, and into it are thrown  little lots about the size of a bean, with letters on them. Two are  marked alpha [Footnote: The Greek alphabet runs: alpha, beta, gamma,  delta, epsilon, zeta, eta, theta, iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi,  omicron, pi, rho, sigma, tau, upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega.], two beta,  two more gamma, and so on, if the competitors run to more than that--two  lots always to each letter. A competitor comes up, makes a prayer to  Zeus, dips his hand into the urn, and pulls out one lot; then another  does the same; there is a policeman to each drawer, who holds his hand so  that he cannot see what letter he has drawn. When all have drawn, the  chief police officer, I think it is, or one of the stewards themselves--I  cannot quite remember this detail--, goes round and examines the lots  while they stand in a circle, and puts together the two alphas for the  wrestling or pancratium, and so for the two betas, and the rest. That is  the procedure when the number of competitors is even, as eight, four, or  twelve. If it is five, seven, nine, or other odd number, an odd letter is  marked on one lot, which is put in with the others, not having a  duplicate. Whoever draws this is a bye, and waits till the rest have  finished their ties; no duplicate turns up for him, you see; and it is a  considerable advantage to an athlete, to know that he will come fresh  against tired competitors.    _Ly_. Stop there; that is just what I wanted. There are nine of them, we  will say, and they have all drawn, and the lots are in their hands. You go  round--for I promote you from spectator to steward--examining the letters;  and I suppose you will not know who is the bye till you have been to them  all and paired them.    _Her_. How do you mean?    _Ly_. It is impossible for you to hit straight upon the letter which  indicates the bye; at least, you may hit upon the letter, but you will  not know about the bye; it was not announced beforehand that kappa or mu  or iota had the appointment in its gift; when you find alpha, you look  for the holder of the other alpha, whom finding, you pair the two. Again  finding beta, you inquire into the whereabouts of the second beta which  matches it; and so all through, till there is no one left but the holder  of the single unpaired letter.    _Her_. But suppose you come upon it first or second, what will you do  then?    _Ly_. Never mind me; I want to know what _you_ will do, Mr. Steward. Will  you say at once, Here is the bye? or will you have to go round to all, and  see whether there is a duplicate to be found, it being impossible to know  the bye till you have seen all the lots?    _Her_. Why, Lycinus, I shall know quite easily; nine being the number, if  I find the epsilon first or second, I know the holder of it for the bye.    _Ly_. But how?    _Her_. How? Why, two of them must have alpha, two beta, and of the  next two pairs one has certainly drawn gammas and the other deltas, so  that four letters have been used up over eight competitors. Obviously,  then, the next letter, which is epsilon, is the only one that can be odd,  and the drawer of it is the bye.    _Ly_. Shall I extol your intelligence, or would you rather I explained to  you my own poor idea, which differs?    _Her_. The latter, of course, though I cannot conceive how you can  reasonably differ.    _Ly_. You have gone on the assumption that the letters are taken in  alphabetical order, until at a particular one the number of competitors  runs short; and I grant you it may be done so at Olympia. But suppose we  were to pick out five letters at random, say chi, sigma, zeta, kappa,  theta, and duplicate the other four on the lots for eight competitors,  but put a single zeta on the ninth, which we meant to indicate the  bye--what then would you do if you came on the zeta first? How can you  tell that its holder is the bye till you have been all round and found no  counterpart to it? for you could not tell by the alphabetical order, as  at Olympia.    _Her_. A difficult question.    _Ly_. Look at the same thing another way. Suppose we put no letters  at all on the lots, but, instead of them, signs and marks such as the  Egyptians use for letters, men with dogs' or lions' heads. Or no, those  are rather too strange; let us avoid hybrids, and put down simple forms,  as well as our draughtsmanship will allow--men on two lots, horses on  two, a pair of cocks, a pair of dogs, and let a lion be the mark of the  ninth. Now, if you hit upon the lion at the first try, how can you tell  that this is the bye-maker, until you have gone all round and seen  whether any one else has a lion to match?    _Her_. Your question is too much for me.    _Ly_. No wonder; there is no plausible answer. Consequently if we  mean to find either the man who has the sacred cup, or the bye, or our  best guide to the famous city of Corinth, we must absolutely go to and  examine them all, trying them carefully, stripping and comparing them;  the truth will be hard enough to find, even so. If I am to take any one's  advice upon the right philosophy to choose, I insist upon his knowing  what they all say; every one else I disqualify; I will not trust him  while there is one philosophy he is unacquainted with; that one may  possibly be the best of all. If some one were to produce a handsome man,  and state that he was the handsomest of mankind, we should not accept  that, unless we knew he had seen all men; very likely his man is  handsome, but whether the handsomest, he has no means of knowing without  seeing all. Now we are looking not simply for beauty, but for the  greatest beauty, and if we miss that, we shall account ourselves no  further than we were; we shall not be content with chancing upon some  sort of beauty; we are in search of a definite thing, the supreme beauty,  which must necessarily be _one_.    _Her_. True.    _Ly_. Well then, can you name me a man who has tried every road in  philosophy? one who, knowing the doctrine of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle,  Chrysippus, Epicurus, and the rest, has ended by selecting one out of all  these roads, because he has proved it genuine, and had found it by  experience to be the only one that led straight to Happiness? If we  can meet with such a man, we are at the end of our troubles.    _Her_. Alas, that is no easy matter.    _Ly_. What shall we do, then? I do not think we ought to despair, in the  momentary absence of such a guide. Perhaps the best and safest plan  of all is to set to work oneself, go through every system, and carefully  examine the various doctrines.    _Her_. That is what seems to be indicated. I am afraid, though, there is  an obstacle in what you said just now: it is not easy, when you have  committed yourself with a spread of canvas to the wind, to get home  again. How can a man try all the roads, when, as you said, he will be  unable to escape from the first of them?    _Ly_. My notion is to copy Theseus, get dame Ariadne to give us a skein,  and go into one labyrinth after another, with the certainty of getting out  by winding it up.    _Her_. Who is to be our Ariadne? Where shall we find the skein?    _Ly_. Never despair; I fancy I have found something to hold on to and  escape.    _Her_. And what is that?    _Ly_. It is not original; I borrow it from one of the wise men: 'Be sober  and doubt all things,' says he. If we do not believe everything we are  told, but behave like jurymen who suspend judgement till they have heard  the other side, we may have no difficulty in getting out of the  labyrinths.    _Her_. A good plan; let us try it.    _Ly_. Very well, which shall we start with? However, that will make no  difference; we may begin with whomsoever we fancy, Pythagoras, say; how  long shall we allow for learning the whole of Pythagoreanism? and do  not omit the five years of silence; including those, I suppose thirty  altogether will do; or, if you do not like that, still we cannot put it  lower than twenty.    _Her_. Put it at that.    _Ly_. Plato will come next with as many more, and then Aristotle cannot do  with less.    _Her_. No.    _Ly_. As to Chrysippus, I need not ask you; you have told me already that  forty is barely enough.    _Her_. That is so.    _Ly_. And we have still Epicurus and the others. I am not taking high  figures, either, as you will see if you reflect upon the number of  octogenarian Stoics, Epicureans, and Platonists who confess that they  have not yet completely mastered their own systems. Or, if they did not  confess it, at any rate Chrysippus, Aristotle, and Plato would for them;  still more Socrates, who is as good as they; he used to proclaim to all  comers"]]]
