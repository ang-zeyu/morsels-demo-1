New offices of law and administration were  introduced. The country priests were brought under strict control, and  earnest attempts were made to compel them to follow more closely the  disciplinary requirements of the Church.    The monastic system as it existed at the time of the Conquest underwent  the same reformation as the more secular side of the Church organization.  It was indeed regarded by the new ecclesiastical rulers as the source of  the Church's strength and the centre of its life. English abbots were  replaced by Norman, and the new abbots introduced a better discipline and  improvement in the ritual. The rule was more strictly enforced. Worship,  labour, and study became the constant occupations of the monks. Speedily  the institution won a new influence in the life of the nation. The number  of monks grew rapidly; new monasteries were everywhere established, of  which the best remembered, the Conqueror's abbey of Battle, with the high  altar of its church standing where Harold's standard had stood in the  memorable fight, is only an example. Many of these new foundations were  daughter-houses of great French monasteries, and it is a significant fact  that by the end of the reign of William's son Henry, Cluny, the source of  this monastic reformation for the world, had sent seventeen colonies into  England. Wealth poured into these establishments from the gifts of king  and barons and common men alike. Their buildings grew in number and in  magnificence, and the poor and suffering of the realm received their  share in the new order of things, through a wider and better organized  charity.    With this new monastic life began a new era of learning. Schools were  everywhere founded or renewed. The universal language of Christendom took  once more its proper place as the literary language of the cloister,  although the use of English lingered for a time here and there. England  caught at last the theological eagerness of the continent in the age when  the stimulus of the new dialectic method was beginning to be felt, and soon  demanded to be heard in the settlement of the problems of the thinking  world. Lanfranc continued to write as Archbishop of Canterbury.[5] Even  something that may be called a literary spirit in an age of general  barrenness was awakened. Poems were produced not unworthy of mention, and  the generation of William's sons was not finished when such histories had  been written as those of Eadmer and William of Malmesbury, superior in  conception and execution to anything produced in England since the days of  Bede. In another way the stimulus of these new influences showed itself in  an age of building, and by degrees the land was covered with those vast  monastic and cathedral churches which still excite our admiration and  reveal to us the fact that the narrow minds of what we were once pleased to  call the dark ages were capable, in one direction at least, of great and  lofty conceptions. Norman ideals of massive strength speak to us as clearly  from the arches of Winchester or the piers of Gloucester as from the firm  hand and stern rule of William or Henry.    In general the Conquest incorporated England closely, as has already been  said, with that organic whole of life and achievement which we call  Christendom. This was not more true of the ecclesiastical side of things  than of the political or constitutional. But the Church of the eleventh  century included within itself relatively many more than the Church of  to-day of those activities which quickly respond to a new stimulus and  reveal a new life by increased production. The constitutional changes  involved in the Conquest, and directly traceable to it through a long  line of descent, though more slowly realized and for long in less  striking forms, were in truth destined to produce results of greater  permanence and a wider influence. The final result of the Norman Conquest  was a constitutional creation, new in the history of the world. Nothing  like this followed in the sphere of the Church. But for a generation or  two the abundant vigour which flowed through the renewed religious life  of Europe, and the radical changes which were necessary to bring England  into full harmony with it, made the ecclesiastical revolution seem the  most impressive and the most violent of the changes which took place in  this age in English public organization and life. If we may trust a later  chronicler, whose record is well supported by independent and earlier  evidence, in the same year in which these legatine councils met, and in  which the reformation of the Church was begun, there was introduced an  innovation, so far as the Saxon Church is concerned, which would have  seemed to the leaders of the reform party hostile to their cause had they  not been so familiar with it elsewhere, or had they been conscious of the  full meaning of their own demands. Matthew Paris, in the thirteenth  century, records that, in 1070, the king decreed that all bishoprics and  abbacies which were holding baronies, and which heretofore had been free  from all secular obligations, should be liable to military service; and  caused to be enrolled, according to his own will, the number of knights  which should be due from each in time of war. Even if this statement were  without support, it would be intrinsically probable at this or some near  date. The endowment lands of bishopric and abbey, or rather a part of  these lands in each case, would inevitably be regarded as a fief held of  the crown, and as such liable to the regular feudal services. This was  the case in every feudal land, and no one would suppose that there should  be any exception in England. The amount of the service was arbitrarily  fixed by the king in these ecclesiastical baronies, just as it was in the  lay fiefs. The fact was important enough to attract the notice of the  chroniclers because the military service, regulated in this way, would  seem to be more of an innovation than the other services by which the  fief was held, like the court service, for example, though it was not so  in reality.    This transformation in life and culture was wrought in the English Church  with the full sanction and support of the king. In Normandy, as well as in  England, was this the case. The plans of the reform party had been carried  out more fully in some particulars in these lands than the Church alone  would have attempted at the time, because they had convinced the judgment  of the sovereign and won his favour. At every step of the process where  there was need, the power of the State had been at the command of the  Church, to remove abuses or to secure the introduction of reforms. But  with the theocratic ideas which went with these reforms in the teaching of  the Church William had no sympathy. The leaders of the reformation might  hold to the ideal supremacy of pope over king, and to the superior mission  and higher power of the Church as compared with the State, but there could  be no practical realization of these theories in any Norman land so long  as the Conqueror lived. In no part of Europe had the sovereign exercised  a greater or more direct power over the Church than in Normandy. All  departments of its life were subject to his control, if there was reason  to exert it. This had been true for so long a time that the Church was  accustomed to the situation and accepted it without complaint. This power  William had no intention of yielding. He proposed to exercise it in  England as he had in Normandy,[6] and, even in this age of fierce conflict  with its great temporal rival, the emperor, the papacy made no sharply  drawn issue with him on these points. There could be no question of the  headship of the world in his case, and on the vital moral point he was too  nearly in harmony with the Church to make an issue easy. On the importance  of obeying the monastic rule, the celibacy of the clergy, and the purchase  of ecclesiastical office, he agreed in theory with the disciples of  Cluny.[7] But, if he would not sell a bishopric, he was determined that  the bishop should be his man; he stood ready to increase the power and  independence of the Church, but always as an organ of the State, as a part  of the machine through which the government was carried on.    It is quite within the limits of possibility that, in his negotiations  with Rome before his invasion of England, William may have given the pope  to understand, in some indefinite and informal way, that if he won the  kingdom, he would hold it of St. Peter. In accepting the consecrated  banner which the pope sent him, he could hardly fail to know that he  might be understood to be acknowledging a feudal dependence. When the  kingdom was won, however, he found himself unwilling to carry out such an  arrangement, whether tacitly or openly promised. To Gregory VII's demand  for his fealty he returned a respectful but firm refusal. The sovereignty  of England was not to be diminished; he would hold the kingdom as freely  as his predecessors had done. Peter's pence, which it belonged of right  to England to pay, should be regularly collected and sent to Rome, but no  right of rule, even theoretical, over king or kingdom, could be allowed  the pope.    An ecclesiastical historian whose childhood and early youth fell in  William's reign, and who was deeply impressed with the strong control  under which he held the Church, has recorded three rules to govern the  relation between Church and State, which he says were established by  William.[8] These are: 1, that no one should be recognized as pope in  England except at his command, nor any papal letters received without his  permission; 2, that no acts of the national councils should be binding  without his sanction; 3, that none of his barons or servants should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8559"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 360, November 25, 1882 (#13)"],[1,"evening killed a moderate sized rattlesnake--_Crotalus  horridus_--which had not bitten anything, I found the gland fully  charged with the white opaque poison; on adding iodine solution to a  drop of this a dense light-brown precipitate was immediately formed,  quite similar to that obtained with most alkaloids, exhibiting under the  microscope no crystalline structure.    In the absence of iodine a good extemporaneous solution for testing  alkaloids, and perhaps a snake poison antidote, may be made by adding a  few drops of ferric chloride to solution of potassium of iodide; this  is a very convenient test agent which I used in my laboratory for many  years.    Although rattlesnake poison could be obtained here in very considerable  quantity, it is out of my power to make such experiments as I could  desire, being without any chemical appliances and living a hundred miles  or more from any laboratory. The same may be said with regard to books,  and possibly the above iodine reaction has been already described.    Dr. Richards states that the cobra poison is destroyed by potassium  permanganate; but this is no argument in favor of that salt as an  antidote. Mr. Pedler also refers to it, but allows that it would not be  probably of any use after the poison had been absorbed. Of this I  think there can be no doubt, remembering the easy decomposition of  permanganate by most organic substances, and I cannot but think that the  medicinal or therapeutic advantages of that salt, taken internally, are  equally problematical, unless the action is supposed to take place in  the stomach.    In the bladder of the same rattlesnake I found a considerable  quantity of light-brown amorphous ammonium urate, the urine pale  yellow.--_Chemical News_.

Macgowan, in Medical Reports of China. 1881.]      Two writers in _Nature_, both having for their theme \"Skin-furrows on  the Hand,\" solicit information on the subject from China.[1] As the  subject is considered to have a bearing on medical jurisprudence and  ethnology as well, this report is a suitable vehicle for responding to  the demand.    [Footnote 1: Henry Faulds, Tzukiyi Hospital, Tokio, Japan. W. J.  Herschel, Oxford, England.--_Nature_, 28th October and 25th November,  1880.]    Dr. Faulds' observations on the finger-tips of the Japanese have an  ethnic bearing and relate to the subject of heredity. Mr. Herschel  considers the subject as an agent of Government, he having charge for  twenty years of registration offices in India, where he employed finger  marks as sign manuals, the object being to prevent personation and  repudiation. Doolittle, in his \"Social Life of the Chinese,\" describes  the custom. I cannot now refer to native works where the practice of  employing digital rugae as a sign manual is alluded to. I doubt if its  employment in the courts is of ancient date. Well-informed natives think  that it came into vogue subsequent to the Han period; if so, it is in  Egypt that earliest evidence of the practice is to be found. Just as the  Chinese courts now require criminals to sign confessions by impressing  thereto the whorls of their thumb-tips--the right thumb in the case of  women, the left in the case of men--so the ancient Egyptians, it  is represented, required confessions to be sealed with their  thumbnails--most likely the tip of the digit, as in China. Great  importance is attached in the courts to this digital form of signature,  \"finger form.\" Without a confession no criminal can be legally executed,  and the confession to be valid must be attested by the thumb-print  of the prisoner. No direct coercion is employed to secure this; a  contumacious culprit may, however, be tortured until he performs the  act which is a prerequisite to his execution. Digital signatures are  sometimes required in the army to prevent personation; the general  in command at Wenchow enforces it on all his troops. A document thus  attested can no more be forged or repudiated than a photograph--not so  easily, for while the period of half a lifetime effects great changes  in the physiognomy, the rugae of the fingers present the same appearance  from the cradle to the grave; time writes no wrinkles there. In the  army everywhere, when the description of a person is written down, the  relative number of volutes and coniferous finger-tips is noted. It  is called taking the \"whelk striae,\" the fusiform being called \"rice  baskets,\" and the volutes \"peck measures.\" A person unable to write, the  form of signature which defies personation or repudiation is required in  certain domestic cases, as in the sale of children or women. Often when  a child is sold the parents affix their finger marks to the bill of  sale; when a husband puts away his wife, giving her a bill of divorce,  he marks the document with his entire palm; and when a wife is sold, the  purchaser requires the seller to stamp the paper with hands and feet,  the four organs duly smeared with ink. Professional fortune tellers in  China take into account almost the entire system of the person whose  future they attempt to forecast, and of course they include palmistry,  but the rugae of the finger-ends do not receive much attention. Amateur  fortune-tellers, however, discourse as glibly on them as phrenologists  do of \"bumps\"--it is so easy. In children the relative number of volute  and conical striae indicate their future. \"If there are nine volutes,\"  says a proverb, \"to one conical, the boy will attain distinction without  toil.\"    Regarded from an ethnological point of view, I can discover merely that  the rugae of Chinamen's fingers differ from Europeans', but there is so  little uniformity observable that they form no basis for distinction,  and while the striae may be noteworthy points in certain medico-legal  questions, heredity is not one of them.           *       *       *       *       *          LUCIDITY.      At the close of an interesting address lately delivered at the reopening  of the Liverpool University College and School of Medicine, Mr. Matthew  Arnold said if there was one word which he should like to plant in the  memories of his audience, and to leave sticking there after he had gone,  it was the word _lucidity_. If he had to fix upon the three great wants  at this moment of the three principal nations of Europe, he should say  that the great want of the French was morality, that the great want of  the Germans was civil courage, and that our own great want was lucidity.  Our own want was, of course, what concerned us the most. People were apt  to remark the defects which accompanied certain qualities, and to think  that the qualities could not be desirable because of the defects which  they saw accompanying them. There was no greater and salutary lesson for  men to learn than that a quality may be accompanied, naturally perhaps,  by grave dangers; that it may actually present itself accompanied by  terrible defects, and yet that it might itself be indispensable. Let him  illustrate what he meant by an example, the force of which they would  all readily feel. Seriousness was a quality of our nation. Perhaps  seriousness was always accompanied by certain dangers. But, at any rate,  many of our French neighbors would say that they found our seriousness  accompanied by so many false ideas, so much prejudice, so much that was  disagreeable, that it could not have the value which we attributed to  it. And yet we knew that it was invaluable. Let them follow the same  mode of reasoning as to the quality of lucidity. The French had a  national turn for lucidity as we had a national turn for seriousness.  Perhaps a national turn for lucidity carried with it always certain  dangers. Be this as it might, it was certain that we saw in the French,  along with their lucidity, a want of seriousness, a want of reverence,  and other faults, which greatly displeased us. Many of us were inclined  in consequence to undervalue their lucidity, or to deny that they  had it. We were wrong: it existed as our seriousness existed; it was  valuable as our seriousness was valuable. Both the one and the other  were valuable, and in the end indispensable.    What was lucidity? It was negatively that the French have it, and he  would therefore deal with its negative character merely. Negatively,  lucidity was the perception of the want of truth and validness in  notions long current, the perception that they are no longer possible,  that their time is finished, and they can serve us no more. All through  the last century a prodigious travail for lucidity was going forward  in France. Its principal agent was a man whose name excited generally  repulsion in England, Voltaire. Voltaire did a great deal of harm in  France. But it was not by his lucidity that he did harm; he did it by  his want of seriousness, his want of reverence, his want of sense for  much that is deepest in human nature. But by his lucidity he did good.    All admired Luther. Conduct was three-fourths of life, and a man who  worked for conduct, therefore, worked for more than a man who worked for  intelligence. But having promised this, it might be said that the Luther  of the eighteenth century and of the cultivated classes was Voltaire.  As Luther had an antipathy to what was immoral, so Voltaire had an  antipathy to what was absurd, and both of them made war upon the object  of their antipathy with such masterly power, with so much conviction,  so much energy, so much genius, that they carried their world with  them--Luther his Protestant world, and Voltaire his French world--and  the cultivated classes throughout the continent of Europe generally.    Voltaire had more than negative lucidity; he had the large and true  conception that a number and equilibrium of activities were necessary  for man. \"_Il faut douner a notre"]]]
