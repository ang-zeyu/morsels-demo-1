He looked up, blinking, and saw an  offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.    \"This one's come of himself, whatever,\" said Mr. Piperson, turning  Pigling's pockets inside out. He pushed the hamper into a corner, threw  a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and  unlaced his boots.    Pigling Bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it,  shyly warming his hands. Mr. Piperson pulled off a boot and threw it  against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen. There was a  smothered noise--\"Shut up!\" said Mr. Piperson. Pigling Bland warmed his  hands, and eyed him.    Mr. Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first,  there was again a curious noise--\"Be quiet, will ye?\" said Mr. Piperson.  Pigling Bland sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.    Mr. Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge. It seemed to  Pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a  suppressed interest in the cooking, but he was too hungry to be troubled  by noises.    Mr. Piperson poured out three platefuls: for himself, for Pigling, and a  third--after glaring at Pigling--he put away with much scuffling, and  locked up. Pigling Bland ate his supper discreetly.    After supper Mr. Piperson consulted an almanac, and felt Pigling's ribs;  it was too late in the season for curing bacon, and he grudged his meal.  Besides, the hens had seen this pig.    He looked at the small remains of a flitch, and then looked undecidedly  at Pigling. \"You may sleep on the rug,\" said Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson.    Pigling Bland slept like a top. In the morning Mr. Piperson made more  porridge; the weather was warmer. He looked to see how much meal was  left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied--\"You'll likely be moving on  again?\" said he to Pigling Bland.    Before Pigling could reply, a neighbour, who was giving Mr. Piperson and  the hens a lift, whistled from the gate. Mr. Piperson hurried out with  the hamper, enjoining Pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle  with nought; or \"I'll come back and skin ye!\" said Mr. Piperson.    It crossed Pigling's mind that if HE had asked for a lift, too, he might  still have been in time for market.    But he distrusted Peter Thomas.    After finishing breakfast at his leisure, Pigling had a look round the  cottage; everything was locked up. He found some potato peelings in a  bucket in the back kitchen. Pigling ate the peel, and washed up the  porridge plates in the bucket. He sang while he worked--        \"Tom with his pipe made such a noise,           He called up all the girls and boys--      \"And they all ran to hear him play           \"'Over the hills and far away!'\"    Suddenly a little smothered voice chimed in--        \"Over the hills and a great way off,           The wind shall blow my top knot off!\"    Pigling Bland put down a plate which he was wiping, and listened.    After a long pause, Pigling went on tip-toe and peeped round the door  into the front kitchen. There was nobody there.    After another pause, Pigling approached the door of the locked cupboard,  and snuffed at the key-hole. It was quite quiet.    After another long pause, Pigling pushed a peppermint under the door. It  was sucked in immediately.    In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all the remaining six  peppermints.    When Mr. Piperson returned, he found Pigling sitting before the fire; he  had brushed up the hearth and put on the pot to boil; the meal was not  get-at-able.    Mr. Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots  of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest. He did lock the cupboard  door; but without properly shutting it. He went to bed early, and told  Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock.    Pigling Bland sat by the fire, eating his supper.    All at once at his elbow, a little voice spoke--\"My name is Pig-wig.  Make me more porridge, please!\" Pigling Bland jumped, and looked round.    A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.  She had twinkly little screwed up eyes, a double chin, and a short  turned up nose.    She pointed at Pigling's plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to  the meal chest. \"How did you come here?\" asked Pigling Bland.    \"Stolen,\" replied Pig-wig, with her mouth full. Pigling helped himself  to meal without scruple. \"What for?\" \"Bacon, hams,\" replied Pig-wig  cheerfully. \"Why on earth don't you run away?\" exclaimed the horrified  Pigling.    \"I shall after supper,\" said Pig-wig decidedly.    Pigling Bland made more porridge and watched her shyly.    She finished a second plate, got up, and looked about her, as though she  were going to start.    \"You can't go in the dark,\" said Pigling Bland.    Pig-wig looked anxious.    \"Do you know your way by daylight?\"    \"I know we can see this little white house from the hills across the  river. Which way are YOU going, Mr. Pig?\"    \"To market--I have two pig papers. I might take you to the bridge; if  you have no objection,\" said Pigling much confused and sitting on the  edge of his coppy stool. Pig-wig's gratitude was such and she asked so  many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.    He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep. She became quiet,  and there was a smell of peppermint.    \"I thought you had eaten them,\" said Pigling, waking suddenly.    \"Only the corners,\" replied Pig-wig, studying the sentiments with much  interest by the firelight.    \"I wish you wouldn't; he might smell them through the ceiling,\" said the  alarmed Pigling.    Pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket; \"Sing  something,\" she demanded.    \"I am sorry ... I have tooth-ache,\" said Pigling much dismayed.    \"Then I will sing,\" replied Pig-wig. \"You will not mind if I say iddy  tidditty? I have forgotten some of the words.\"    Pigling Bland made no objection; he sat with his eyes half shut, and  watched her.    She wagged her head and rocked about, clapping time and singing in a  sweet little grunty voice--        \"A funny old mother pig lived in a           stye, and three little piggies had she;      \"(Ti idditty idditty) umph, umph,           umph! and the little pigs said, wee, wee!\"    She sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse  her head nodded a little lower, and her little twinkly eyes closed up.        \"Those three little piggies grew peaky           and lean, and lean they might very           well be;      \"For somehow they couldn't say umph,           umph, umph! and they wouldn't           say wee, wee, wee!      \"For somehow they couldn't say--    Pig-wig's head bobbed lower and lower, until she rolled over, a little  round ball, fast asleep on the hearth-rug.    Pigling Bland, on tip-toe, covered her up with an antimacassar.    He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat  listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of Mr.  Piperson overhead.    Early in the morning, between dark and daylight, Pigling tied up his  little bundle and woke up Pig-wig. She was excited and half-frightened.  \"But it's dark! How can we find our way?\"    \"The cock has crowed; we must start before the hens come out; they might  shout to Mr. Piperson.\"    Pig-wig sat down again, and commenced to cry.    \"Come away Pig-wig; we can see when we get used to it. Come! I can hear  them clucking!\"    Pigling had never said shuh! to a hen in his life, being peaceable; also  he remembered the hamper.    He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them. There was no  garden; the neighbourhood of Mr. Piperson's was all scratched up by  fowls. They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the  road.    The sun rose while they were crossing the moor, a dazzle of light over  the tops of the hills. The sunshine crept down the slopes into the  peaceful green valleys, where little white cottages nestled in gardens  and orchards.    \"That's Westmorland,\" said Pig-wig. She dropped Pigling's hand and  commenced to dance, singing--             \"Tom, Tom, the piper's son, stole a pig                and away he ran!        \"But all the tune that he could play,                was 'Over the hills and far away!'\"    \"Come, Pig-wig, we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring.\"  \"Why do you want to go to market, Pigling?\" inquired Pig-wig presently.  \"I don't want; I want to grow potatoes.\" \"Have a peppermint?\" said  Pig-wig. Pigling Bland refused quite crossly. \"Does your poor toothy  hurt?\" inquired Pig-wig. Pigling Bland grunted.    Pig-wig ate the peppermint herself and followed the opposite side of the  road. \"Pig-wig! keep under the wall, there's a man ploughing.\" Pig-wig  crossed over, they hurried down hill towards the county boundary.    Suddenly Pigling stopped; he heard wheels.    Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman's cart. The reins  flapped on the horse's back, the grocer was reading a newspaper.    \"Take that peppermint out of your mouth, Pig-wig, we may have to run.  Don't say one word. Leave it to me. And in sight of the bridge!\" said  poor Pigling, nearly crying. He began to walk frightfully lame, holding  Pig-wig's arm.    The grocer, intent upon his news-paper, might have passed them, if his  horse had not shied and snorted. He pulled the cart crossways, and held  down his whip. \"Hallo! Where are YOU going to?\"--Pigling Bland stared at  him vacantly.    \"Are you deaf? Are you going to market?\" Pigling nodded slowly.    \"I thought as much. It was yesterday. Show me your licence?\"    Pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer's horse which had  picked up a stone.    The grocer flicked his whip--\"Papers? Pig licence?\" Pigling fumbled in  all his pockets, and handed up the papers. The grocer read them, but  still seemed dissatisfied. \"This here pig is a young lady; is her name  Alexander?\" Pig-wig"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827"],[0,"The Problems of Philosophy (#13)"],[1,"ta, than the probability that all men are mortal. (This is  obvious, because if all men are mortal, so is Socrates; but if Socrates  is mortal, it does not follow that all men are mortal.) Hence we shall  reach the conclusion that Socrates is mortal with a greater approach to  certainty if we make our argument purely inductive than if we go by way  of 'all men are mortal' and then use deduction.    This illustrates the difference between general propositions known _a  priori_ such as 'two and two are four', and empirical generalizations  such as 'all men are mortal'. In regard to the former, deduction is the  right mode of argument, whereas in regard to the latter, induction is  always theoretically preferable, and warrants a greater confidence in  the truth of our conclusion, because all empirical generalizations are  more uncertain than the instances of them.    We have now seen that there are propositions known _a priori_, and that  among them are the propositions of logic and pure mathematics, as well  as the fundamental propositions of ethics. The question which must  next occupy us is this: How is it possible that there should be such  knowledge? And more particularly, how can there be knowledge of general  propositions in cases where we have not examined all the instances, and  indeed never can examine them all, because their number is infinite?  These questions, which were first brought prominently forward by  the German philosopher Kant (1724-1804), are very difficult, and  historically very important.        CHAPTER VIII. HOW _A PRIORI_ KNOWLEDGE IS POSSIBLE    Immanuel Kant is generally regarded as the greatest of the modern  philosophers. Though he lived through the Seven Years War and the  French Revolution, he never interrupted his teaching of philosophy at  Koenigsberg in East Prussia. His most distinctive contribution was the  invention of what he called the 'critical' philosophy, which, assuming  as a datum that there is knowledge of various kinds, inquired how such  knowledge comes to be possible, and deduced, from the answer to this  inquiry, many metaphysical results as to the nature of the world.  Whether these results were valid may well be doubted. But Kant  undoubtedly deserves credit for two things: first, for having perceived  that we have _a priori_ knowledge which is not purely 'analytic', i.e.  such that the opposite would be self-contradictory, and secondly,  for having made evident the philosophical importance of the theory of  knowledge.    Before the time of Kant, it was generally held that whatever knowledge  was _a priori_ must be 'analytic'. What this word means will be best  illustrated by examples. If I say, 'A bald man is a man', 'A plane  figure is a figure', 'A bad poet is a poet', I make a purely analytic  judgement: the subject spoken about is given as having at least two  properties, of which one is singled out to be asserted of it. Such  propositions as the above are trivial, and would never be enunciated  in real life except by an orator preparing the way for a piece of  sophistry. They are called 'analytic' because the predicate is obtained  by merely analysing the subject. Before the time of Kant it was thought  that all judgements of which we could be certain _a priori_ were of this  kind: that in all of them there was a predicate which was only part  of the subject of which it was asserted. If this were so, we should be  involved in a definite contradiction if we attempted to deny anything  that could be known _a priori_. 'A bald man is not bald' would assert  and deny baldness of the same man, and would therefore contradict  itself. Thus according to the philosophers before Kant, the law of  contradiction, which asserts that nothing can at the same time have and  not have a certain property, sufficed to establish the truth of all _a  priori_ knowledge.    Hume (1711-76), who preceded Kant, accepting the usual view as to what  makes knowledge _a priori_, discovered that, in many cases which had  previously been supposed analytic, and notably in the case of cause and  effect, the connexion was really synthetic. Before Hume, rationalists at  least had supposed that the effect could be logically deduced from the  cause, if only we had sufficient knowledge. Hume argued--correctly, as  would now be generally admitted--that this could not be done. Hence he  inferred the far more doubtful proposition that nothing could be known  _a priori_ about the connexion of cause and effect. Kant, who had been  educated in the rationalist tradition, was much perturbed by Hume's  scepticism, and endeavoured to find an answer to it. He perceived that  not only the connexion of cause and effect, but all the propositions  of arithmetic and geometry, are 'synthetic', i.e. not analytic: in  all these propositions, no analysis of the subject will reveal the  predicate. His stock instance was the proposition 7 + 5 = 12. He pointed  out, quite truly, that 7 and 5 have to be put together to give 12: the  idea of 12 is not contained in them, nor even in the idea of adding them  together. Thus he was led to the conclusion that all pure mathematics,  though _a priori_, is synthetic; and this conclusion raised a new  problem of which he endeavoured to find the solution.    The question which Kant put at the beginning of his philosophy, namely  'How is pure mathematics possible?' is an interesting and difficult one,  to which every philosophy which is not purely sceptical must find  some answer. The answer of the pure empiricists, that our mathematical  knowledge is derived by induction from particular instances, we have  already seen to be inadequate, for two reasons: first, that the validity  of the inductive principle itself cannot be proved by induction;  secondly, that the general propositions of mathematics, such as 'two  and two always make four', can obviously be known with certainty by  consideration of a single instance, and gain nothing by enumeration of  other cases in which they have been found to be true. Thus our knowledge  of the general propositions of mathematics (and the same applies to  logic) must be accounted for otherwise than our (merely probable)  knowledge of empirical generalizations such as 'all men are mortal'.    The problem arises through the fact that such knowledge is general,  whereas all experience is particular. It seems strange that we should  apparently be able to know some truths in advance about particular  things of which we have as yet no experience; but it cannot easily be  doubted that logic and arithmetic will apply to such things. We do not  know who will be the inhabitants of London a hundred years hence; but  we know that any two of them and any other two of them will make four of  them. This apparent power of anticipating facts about things of which  we have no experience is certainly surprising. Kant's solution of the  problem, though not valid in my opinion, is interesting. It is, however,  very difficult, and is differently understood by different philosophers.  We can, therefore, only give the merest outline of it, and even that  will be thought misleading by many exponents of Kant's system.    What Kant maintained was that in all our experience there are two  elements to be distinguished, the one due to the object (i.e. to what we  have called the 'physical object'), the other due to our own nature. We  saw, in discussing matter and sense-data, that the physical object is  different from the associated sense-data, and that the sense-data are to  be regarded as resulting from an interaction between the physical  object and ourselves. So far, we are in agreement with Kant. But what  is distinctive of Kant is the way in which he apportions the shares of  ourselves and the physical object respectively. He considers that the  crude material given in sensation--the colour, hardness, etc.--is due  to the object, and that what we supply is the arrangement in space  and time, and all the relations between sense-data which result from  comparison or from considering one as the cause of the other or in any  other way. His chief reason in favour of this view is that we seem  to have _a priori_ knowledge as to space and time and causality and  comparison, but not as to the actual crude material of sensation. We can  be sure, he says, that anything we shall ever experience must show the  characteristics affirmed of it in our _a priori_ knowledge, because  these characteristics are due to our own nature, and therefore  nothing can ever come into our experience without acquiring these  characteristics.    The physical object, which he calls the 'thing in itself',(1) he regards  as essentially unknowable; what can be known is the object as we have it  in experience, which he calls the 'phenomenon'. The phenomenon, being  a joint product of us and the thing in itself, is sure to have those  characteristics which are due to us, and is therefore sure to conform  to our _a priori_ knowledge. Hence this knowledge, though true of all  actual and possible experience, must not be supposed to apply outside  experience. Thus in spite of the existence of _a priori_ knowledge, we  cannot know anything about the thing in itself or about what is not  an actual or possible object of experience. In this way he tries to  reconcile and harmonize the contentions of the rationalists with the  arguments of the empiricists.    (1) Kant's 'thing in itself' is identical in _definition_ with  the physical object, namely, it is the cause of sensations. In the  properties deduced from the definition it is not identical, since Kant  held (in spite of some inconsistency as regards cause) that we can know  that none of the categories are applicable to the 'thing in itself'.    Apart from minor grounds on which Kant's philosophy may be criticized,  there is one main objection which seems fatal to any attempt to deal  with the problem of _a priori_ knowledge by his method.
