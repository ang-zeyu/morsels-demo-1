Learned informations (written arguments) on the import of the verdict,  which must be allowed a very mild one in the circumstances, were laid  before the High Court of Justiciary. This point is very learnedly debated  in these pleadings by Mr. Grant, Solicitor for the Crown, and the  celebrated Mr. Lockhart, on the part of the prisoner; but James Mhor did  not wait the event of the Court's decision.    He had been committed to the Castle of Edinburgh on some reports that an  escape would be attempted. Yet he contrived to achieve his liberty even  from that fortress. His daughter had the address to enter the prison,  disguised as a cobbler, bringing home work, as she pretended. In this  cobbler's dress her father quickly arrayed himself. The wife and daughter  of the prisoner were heard by the sentinels scolding the supposed cobbler  for having done his work ill, and the man came out with his hat slouched  over his eyes, and grumbling, as if at the manner in which they had  treated him. In this way the prisoner passed all the guards without  suspicion, and made his escape to France. He was afterwards outlawed by  the Court of Justiciary, which proceeded to the trial of Duncan  MacGregor, or Drummond, his brother, 15th January 1753. The accused had  unquestionably been with the party which carried off Jean Key; but no  evidence being brought which applied to him individually and directly,  the jury found him not guilty--and nothing more is known of his fate.    That of James MacGregor, who, from talent and activity, if not by  seniority, may be considered as head of the family, has been long  misrepresented; as it has been generally averred in Law Reports, as well  as elsewhere, that his outlawry was reversed, and that he returned and  died in Scotland. But the curious letters published in Blackwood's  Magazine for December 1817, show this to be an error. The first of these  documents is a petition to Charles Edward. It is dated 20th September  1753, and pleads his service to the cause of the Stuarts, ascribing his  exile to the persecution of the Hanoverian Government, without any  allusion to the affair of Jean Key, or the Court of Justiciary. It is  stated to be forwarded by MacGregor Drummond of Bohaldie, whom, as before  mentioned, James Mhor acknowledged as his chief.    The effect which this petition produced does not appear. Some temporary  relief was perhaps obtained. But, soon after, this daring adventurer was  engaged in a very dark intrigue against an exile of his own country, and  placed pretty nearly in his own circumstances. A remarkable Highland  story must be here briefly alluded to. Mr. Campbell of Glenure, who had  been named factor for Government on the forfeited estates of Stewart of  Ardshiel, was shot dead by an assassin as he passed through the wood of  Lettermore, after crossing the ferry of Ballachulish. A gentleman, named  James Stewart, a natural brother of Ardshiel, the forfeited person, was  tried as being accessory to the murder, and condemned and executed upon  very doubtful evidence; the heaviest part of which only amounted to the  accused person having assisted a nephew of his own, called Allan Breck  Stewart, with money to escape after the deed was done. Not satisfied with  this vengeance, which was obtained in a manner little to the honour of  the dispensation of justice at the time, the friends of the deceased  Glenure were equally desirous to obtain possession of the person of Allan  Breck Stewart, supposed to be the actual homicide. James Mhor Drummond  was secretly applied to to trepan Stewart to the sea-coast, and bring him  over to Britain, to almost certain death. Drummond MacGregor had kindred  connections with the slain Glenure; and, besides, the MacGregors and  Campbells had been friends of late, while the former clan and the  Stewarts had, as we have seen, been recently at feud; lastly, Robert Oig  was now in custody at Edinburgh, and James was desirous to do some  service by which his brother might be saved. The joint force of these  motives may, in James's estimation of right and wrong, have been some  vindication for engaging in such an enterprise, although, as must be  necessarily supposed, it could only be executed by treachery of a gross  description. MacGregor stipulated for a license to return to England,  promising to bring Allan Breck thither along with him. But the intended  victim was put upon his guard by two countrymen, who suspected James's  intentions towards him. He escaped from his kidnapper, after, as  MacGregor alleged, robbing his portmanteau of some clothes and four  snuff-boxes. Such a charge, it may be observed, could scarce have been  made unless the parties had been living on a footing of intimacy, and had  access to each other's baggage.    Although James Drummond had thus missed his blow in the matter of Allan  Breck Stewart, he used his license to make a journey to London, and had  an interview, as he avers, with Lord Holdernesse. His Lordship, and the  Under-Secretary, put many puzzling questions to him; and, as he says,  offered him a situation, which would bring him bread, in the Government's  service. This office was advantageous as to emolument; but in the opinion  of James Drummond, his acceptance of it would have been a disgrace to his  birth, and have rendered him a scourge to his country. If such a tempting  offer and sturdy rejection had any foundation in fact, it probably  relates to some plan of espionage on the Jacobites, which the Government  might hope to carry on by means of a man who, in the matter of Allan  Breck Stewart, had shown no great nicety of feeling. Drummond MacGregor  was so far accommodating as to intimate his willingness to act in any  station in which other gentlemen of honour served, but not otherwise;--an  answer which, compared with some passages of his past life, may remind  the reader of Ancient Pistol standing upon his reputation.    Having thus proved intractable, as he tells the story, to the proposals  of Lord Holdernesse, James Drummond was ordered instantly to quit  England.    On his return to France, his condition seems to have been utterly  disastrous. He was seized with fever and gravel--ill, consequently, in  body, and weakened and dispirited in mind. Allan Breck Stewart threatened  to put him to death in revenge of the designs he had harboured against  him.*    * Note E. Allan Breck Stewart.    The Stewart clan were in the highest degree unfriendly to him: and his  late expedition to London had been attended with many suspicious  circumstances, amongst which it was not the slightest that he had kept  his purpose secret from his chief Bohaldie. His intercourse with Lord  Holdernesse was suspicious. The Jacobites were probably, like Don Bernard  de Castel Blaze, in Gil Blas, little disposed to like those who kept  company with Alguazils. Mac-Donnell of Lochgarry, a man of unquestioned  honour, lodged an information against James Drummond before the High  Bailie of Dunkirk, accusing him of being a spy, so that he found himself  obliged to leave that town and come to Paris, with only the sum of  thirteen livres for his immediate subsistence, and with absolute beggary  staring him in the face.    We do not offer the convicted common thief, the accomplice in MacLaren's  assassination, or the manager of the outrage against Jean Key, as an  object of sympathy; but it is melancholy to look on the dying struggles  even of a wolf or a tiger, creatures of a species directly hostile to our  own; and, in like manner, the utter distress of this man, whose faults  may have sprung from a wild system of education, working on a haughty  temper, will not be perused without some pity. In his last letter to  Bohaldie, dated Paris, 25th September 1754, he describes his state of  destitution as absolute, and expresses himself willing to exercise his  talents in breaking or breeding horses, or as a hunter or fowler, if he  could only procure employment in such an inferior capacity till something  better should occur. An Englishman may smile, but a Scotchman will sigh  at the postscript, in which the poor starving exile asks the loan of his  patron's bagpipes that he might play over some of the melancholy tunes of  his own land. But the effect of music arises, in a great degree, from  association; and sounds which might jar the nerves of a Londoner or  Parisian, bring back to the Highlander his lofty mountain, wild lake, and  the deeds of his fathers of the glen. To prove MacGregor's claim to our  reader's compassion, we here insert the last part of the letter alluded  to.    \"By all appearance I am born to suffer crosses, and it seems they're not  at an end; for such is my wretched case at present, that I do not know  earthly where to go or what to do, as I have no subsistence to keep body  and soul together. All that I have carried here is about 13 livres, and  have taken a room at my old quarters in Hotel St. Pierre, Rue de Cordier.  I send you the bearer, begging of you to let me know if you are to be in  town soon, that I may have the pleasure of seeing you, for I have none to  make application to but you alone; and all I want is, if it was possible  you could contrive where I could be employed without going to entire  beggary. This probably is a difficult point, yet unless it's attended  with some difficulty, you might think nothing of it, as your long head  can bring about matters of much more difficulty and consequence than  this. If you'd disclose this matter to your friend Mr. Butler, it's  possible he might have some employ wherein I could be of use, as I  pretend to know as much of breeding and riding of horse as any in France,  besides that I am a good hunter either on horseback or by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7026"],[0,"Children's Edition of Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers to Prayer (#13)"],[1,"that perhaps some poor creature had crept up there,  he climbed the ladder, drew himself up through the hole and found himself  under the rafters. There was no light but that which came through a  bull's-eye in the place of a tile. Soon he saw a heap of chips and  shavings, and on them a boy about ten years old.    \"Boy, what are you doing there?\"    \"Hush! don't tell anybody--please, sir.\"    \"What are you doing here?\"    \"Don't tell anybody, sir; I'm hiding.\"    \"What are you hiding from?\"    \"Don't tell anybody, if you please, sir.\"    \"Where's your mother?\"    \"Mother is dead.\"    \"Where's your father?\"    \"Hush! don't tell him! don't tell him! but look here!\" He turned himself  on his face and through the rags of his jacket and shirt my friend saw  the boy's flesh was bruised and the skin broken.    [Illustration]    \"Why, boy, who beat you like that?\"    \"Father did, sir.\"    \"What did your father beat you like that for?\"    \"Father got drunk sir, and beat me 'cos I wouldn't steal.\"    \"Did you ever steal?\"    \"Yes, sir, I was a street thief once.\"    \"And why don't you steal any more?\"    \"Please, sir, I went to the mission school, and they told me there of  God and of Heaven and of Jesus and they taught me, 'Thou shalt not steal,'  and I'll never steal again, if father kills me for it. But, please sir,  don't tell him.\"    \"My boy, you mast not stay here; you will die. Now you wait patiently  here for a little time; I'm going away to see a lady. We will get a  better place for you than this.\"    \"Thank you sir, but please, sir, would you like to hear me sing a little  hymn?\"    Bruised, battered, forlorn; friendless, motherless; hiding away from an  infuriated father he had a little hymn to sing.    \"Yes, I will hear you sing your little hymn.\" He raised himself on his  elbow and then sang:      \"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,    Look upon a little child;    Suffer me to come to Thee.    Fain would I to Thee be brought,    Gracious Lord, forbid it not;    In the Kingdom of Thy grace    Give a little child a place.\"    \"That's the little hymn, sir; Goodbye.\"    The gentleman went away, came back again in less than two hours and  climbed the ladder. There were the chips and there was the little toy  with one hand by his side and the other tucked in his bosom underneath  the little ragged shirt--dead.    -John B. Gough.        SIX MONTHS' RECORD    Very tiny and pale the little girl looked as she stood before those three  grave and dignified gentlemen. She had been ushered into Brother Gordon's  study, where he was holding counsel with two of his deacons, and now,  upon inquiry into the nature of her errand a little shyly she stated  that she desired to be baptized.    \"You are quite too young to be baptized,\" said one of the deacons, \"you  had better run home, and let us talk to your mother.\"    She showed no sign of running however, as her wistful blue eyes traveled  from one face to another of the three gentlemen sitting in their  comfortable chairs; she only drew a step nearer to Brother Gordon. He  arose, and with gentle courtesy that ever marked him, placed her in a  small chair close beside himself.    \"Now, my child, tell me your name, and where you live.\"    \"Winnie Lewis sir, and I live on ---- Street. I go to Sunday school.\"    \"You do; and who is your teacher?\"    \"Miss ----. She is very good to me.\"    \"And you want to be baptized.\"    The child's face glowed as she leaned eagerly toward him, clasping her  hands, but all she said was, \"Yes, sir.\"    \"She cannot be more than six years old,\" said one of the deacons, disapp  rovingly.    Brother Gordon said nothing, but quietly regarded the small, earnest  face, now becoming a little downcast. \"I am nine years old; older than  I look,\" she said.    \"It is unusual for anyone to be baptized so young,\" he said, thoughtfully,  \"We might pray for you though.\"    [Illustration]    The brother did not seem to hear as he asked, \"You know what being  baptized means, Winnie?\"    \"Yes sir\"; and she answered a few questions that proved she comprehended  the meaning of the step she wished to take. She had slipped off her  chair, and now stood close to Brother Gordon's knee.    \"I want to obey all of God's Word. You said last Sunday, sir, that the  lambs should be in the fold.\"    \"I did,\" he answered, with one of his own lovely smiles. \"It is surely  not for us to keep them out. Go home now, my child. I will see about it.\"    The cloud lifted from the child's face, and her expression, as she passed  through the door he opened for her, was one of entire peace.    The next week Winnie's desire was granted. Except for occasional  information from Miss ---- that she was doing well, Brother Gordon heard  no more of her for six months.    Then he was summoned to her funeral.    It was one of June's hottest days. As the minister made his way along  the narrow street where Winnie had lived, he wished for a moment that  he had asked his assistant to come in his place; but as he neared the  house, the crowd filled him with wonder; progress was hindered, and as  perforce he paused for a moment, his eye fell on a crippled lad crying  bitterly as he sat on a low door-step.    \"Did you know Winnie Lewis, my lad?\" he asked.    \"Know her, is it sir? Never a week passed but what she came twice or  thrice with a picture or book, mayhaps an apple for me, an' it's owing  to her an' no clargy at all that I'll ever follow her blessed footsteps  to heaven. She'd read me from her own Bible whenever she came, an' now  she's gone there'll be none at all to help me, for mother's dead an'  dad's drunk, an' the sunshine's gone from Mike's sky intirely with Winnie,  sir.\"    A burst of sobs choked the boy; Brother Gordon passed on, after promising  him a visit very soon, and made his way through the crowd of tear-stained,  sorrowful faces. The Brother came to a stop on the narrow passageway of  the little house. A woman stood beside him drying her fast falling tears  while a wee child hid his face in her skirts and wept.    \"Was Winnie a relative of yours?\" the brother asked.    \"No, sir; but the blessed child was at our house constantly, and when  Bob here was sick she nursed and tended him and her hymns quieted him  when nothing else seemed to do it. It was just the same with all the  neighbors. She took tracts to them all and has prayed with them ever  since she was converted, which was three years ago, when she was but six  years of age, sir. What she's been to us all no one but the Lord will  ever know and now she lies there.\"    Recognized at last, Brother Gordon was led to the room where the child  lay at rest, looking almost younger than when he had seen her in his  study six months before. An old bent woman was crying aloud by the coffin.    \"I never thought she'd go afore I did. She used regular to read an' sing  to me every evening, an' it was her talk an' prayers that made a Christian  of me: you could a'most go to heaven on one of her prayers.\"    \"Mother, mother come away,\" said a young man putting his arm around her  to lead her back. \"You'll see her again.\"    \"I know, I know: she said she'd wait for me at the gate,\" she sobbed as  she followed him; \"but I miss her sore now.\"    \"It's the old lady as Mrs. Lewis lived with sir,\" said a young lad  standing next to Brother Gordon, as one and another still pressed up  towards the little casket for a last look at the beloved face. \"She was  a Unitarian, and she could not hold out against Winnie's prayers and  pleadings to love Jesus, and she's been trusting in Him now for quite  awhile. A mighty good thing it is, too.\"    \"You are right, my lad,\" replied the minister. \"Do you trust Him, too?\"    \"Winnie taught me, sir,\" the lad made answer, and sudden tears filled  his eyes.    [Illustration: \"Mother, mother, come away.\" said a young man, putting  his arm around her to lead her back. \"You'll see her again.\"]    A silence fell on those assembled, and, marveling at such testimony,  Brother Gordon proceeded with the service feeling as if there was little  more he could say of one whose deeds thus spoke for her. Loving hands  had laid flowers all around the child who had led them. One tiny lassie  placed a dandelion in the small waxen fingers and now stood, abandoned  to grief beside the still form that bore the impress of absolute purity.  The service over, again and again was the coffin lid waved back by some  one longing for another look, and they seemed as if they could not let  her go.    The next day a good-looking man came to Brother Gordon's house and was  admitted into his study.    \"I am Winnie's uncle, sir,\" he said simply. \"She never rested till she  made me promise to get saved, and I've come.\"    \"Will you tell me about it, my friend?\" said Brother Gordon.    \"Well, you see, sir, it was this way. Winnie always had been uncommonly  fond of me; and so was I of her,\"--his voice broke a little--\"and I'd  never been saved, never felt, as I believed, quite right. Yet I knew her  religion was true enough, and a half hour before she died she had the  whole family with her, telling them she was going to Jesus, and she took  my hand between her little ones and said, 'Uncle John, you will love  Jesus and meet me in Heaven, won't you?' What could I do? It broke me  all up, and I've come to ask you, sir; what to do so's to keep my promise  to Winnie, for she was an angel if there ever was one. Why, sir, we were  all sitting with her in the dark, and there was a light about that child  as though it shone from Heaven. We all noticed it, every one of us, and  when she drew her last breath and left us, the radiance went, too; it was  gone, quite gone.\"    The man wept like a child, and for a minute Brother Gordon did not speak.  Within a month the uncle was thoroughly converted, baptized, and a sincere  follower of Christ. In the evening after this baptism, Brother Gordon  sat reading in his study, thinking of his little child."]]]
