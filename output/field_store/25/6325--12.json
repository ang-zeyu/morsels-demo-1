This is the  terrible blow that this great poem has struck against sociability and  the joy of life.  Some one called Omar \"the sad, glad old Persian.\" Sad  he is; glad he is not, in any sense of the word whatever. He has been a  worse foe to gladness than the Puritans.    A pensive and graceful Oriental lies under the rose-tree with his  wine-pot and his scroll of poems.  It may seem strange that any one's  thoughts should, at the moment of regarding him, fly back to the dark  bedside where the doctor doles out brandy. It may seem stranger still  that they should go back to the grey wastrel shaking with gin in  Houndsditch. But a great philosophical unity links the three in an evil  bond. Omar Khayyam's wine-bibbing is bad, not because it is  wine-bibbing. It is bad, and very bad, because it is medical  wine-bibbing. It is the drinking of a man who drinks because he is not  happy. His is the wine that shuts out the universe, not the wine that  reveals it. It is not poetical drinking, which is joyous and  instinctive; it is rational drinking, which is as prosaic as an  investment, as unsavoury as a dose of camomile.  Whole heavens above  it, from the point of view of sentiment, though not of style, rises the  splendour of some old English drinking-song--      \"Then pass the bowl, my comrades all,     And let the zider vlow.\"    For this song was caught up by happy men to express the worth of truly  worthy things, of brotherhood and garrulity, and the brief and kindly  leisure of the poor.  Of course, the great part of the more stolid  reproaches directed against the Omarite morality are as false and  babyish as such reproaches usually are.  One critic, whose work I have  read, had the incredible foolishness to call Omar an atheist and a  materialist.  It is almost impossible for an Oriental to be either; the  East understands metaphysics too well for that. Of course, the real  objection which a philosophical Christian would bring against the  religion of Omar, is not that he gives no place to God, it is that he  gives too much place to God. His is that terrible theism which can  imagine nothing else but deity, and which denies altogether the  outlines of human personality and human will.      \"The ball no question makes of Ayes or Noes,     But Here or There as strikes the Player goes;     And He that tossed you down into the field,     He knows about it all--he knows--he knows.\"    A Christian thinker such as Augustine or Dante would object to this  because it ignores free-will, which is the valour and dignity of the  soul. The quarrel of the highest Christianity with this scepticism is  not in the least that the scepticism denies the existence of God; it is  that it denies the existence of man.    In this cult of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker the Rubaiyat stands  first in our time; but it does not stand alone. Many of the most  brilliant intellects of our time have urged us to the same  self-conscious snatching at a rare delight. Walter Pater said that we  were all under sentence of death, and the only course was to enjoy  exquisite moments simply for those moments' sake.  The same lesson was  taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar  Wilde. It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is  not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy  does, not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the  immortal rose which Dante saw. Great joy has in it the sense of  immortality; the very splendour of youth is the sense that it has all  space to stretch its legs in. In all great comic literature, in  \"Tristram Shandy\" or \"Pickwick\", there is this sense of space and  incorruptibility; we feel the characters are deathless people in an  endless tale.    It is true enough, of course, that a pungent happiness comes chiefly in  certain passing moments; but it is not true that we should think of  them as passing, or enjoy them simply \"for those moments' sake.\" To do  this is to rationalize the happiness, and therefore to destroy it.  Happiness is a mystery like religion, and should never be rationalized.  Suppose a man experiences a really splendid moment of pleasure. I do  not mean something connected with a bit of enamel, I mean something  with a violent happiness in it--an almost painful happiness. A man may  have, for instance, a moment of ecstasy in first love, or a moment of  victory in battle.  The lover enjoys the moment, but precisely not for  the moment's sake.  He enjoys it for the woman's sake, or his own sake.  The warrior enjoys the moment, but not for the sake of the moment; he  enjoys it for the sake of the flag. The cause which the flag stands for  may be foolish and fleeting; the love may be calf-love, and last a  week.  But the patriot thinks of the flag as eternal; the lover thinks  of his love as something that cannot end.  These moments are filled  with eternity; these moments are joyful because they do not seem  momentary. Once look at them as moments after Pater's manner, and they  become as cold as Pater and his style.  Man cannot love mortal things.  He can only love immortal things for an instant.    Pater's mistake is revealed in his most famous phrase. He asks us to  burn with a hard, gem-like flame.  Flames are never hard and never  gem-like--they cannot be handled or arranged. So human emotions are  never hard and never gem-like; they are always dangerous, like flames,  to touch or even to examine. There is only one way in which our  passions can become hard and gem-like, and that is by becoming as cold  as gems. No blow then has ever been struck at the natural loves and  laughter of men so sterilizing as this carpe diem of the aesthetes. For  any kind of pleasure a totally different spirit is required; a certain  shyness, a certain indeterminate hope, a certain boyish expectation.  Purity and simplicity are essential to passions--yes even to evil  passions.  Even vice demands a sort of virginity.    Omar's (or Fitzgerald's) effect upon the other world we may let go, his  hand upon this world has been heavy and paralyzing. The Puritans, as I  have said, are far jollier than he. The new ascetics who follow Thoreau  or Tolstoy are much livelier company; for, though the surrender of  strong drink and such luxuries may strike us as an idle negation, it  may leave a man with innumerable natural pleasures, and, above all,  with man's natural power of happiness. Thoreau could enjoy the sunrise  without a cup of coffee.  If Tolstoy cannot admire marriage, at least  he is healthy enough to admire mud. Nature can be enjoyed without even  the most natural luxuries. A good bush needs no wine.  But neither  nature nor wine nor anything else can be enjoyed if we have the wrong  attitude towards happiness, and Omar (or Fitzgerald) did have the wrong  attitude towards happiness. He and those he has influenced do not see  that if we are to be truly gay, we must believe that there is some  eternal gaiety in the nature of things. We cannot enjoy thoroughly even  a pas-de-quatre at a subscription dance unless we believe that the  stars are dancing to the same tune.  No one can be really hilarious but  the serious man.  \"Wine,\" says the Scripture, \"maketh glad the heart of  man,\" but only of the man who has a heart. The thing called high  spirits is possible only to the spiritual. Ultimately a man cannot  rejoice in anything except the nature of things. Ultimately a man can  enjoy nothing except religion.  Once in the world's history men did  believe that the stars were dancing to the tune of their temples, and  they danced as men have never danced since. With this old pagan  eudaemonism the sage of the Rubaiyat has quite as little to do as he  has with any Christian variety. He is no more a Bacchanal than he is a  saint.  Dionysus and his church was grounded on a serious joie-de-vivre  like that of Walt Whitman. Dionysus made wine, not a medicine, but a  sacrament. Jesus Christ also made wine, not a medicine, but a  sacrament. But Omar makes it, not a sacrament, but a medicine.  He  feasts because life is not joyful; he revels because he is not glad.  \"Drink,\" he says, \"for you know not whence you come nor why. Drink, for  you know not when you go nor where.  Drink, because the stars are cruel  and the world as idle as a humming-top. Drink, because there is nothing  worth trusting, nothing worth fighting for. Drink, because all things  are lapsed in a base equality and an evil peace.\"  So he stands  offering us the cup in his hand. And at the high altar of Christianity  stands another figure, in whose hand also is the cup of the vine.  \"Drink\" he says \"for the whole world is as red as this wine, with the  crimson of the love and wrath of God.  Drink, for the trumpets are  blowing for battle and this is the stirrup-cup. Drink, for this my  blood of the new testament that is shed for you.  Drink, for I know of  whence you come and why. Drink, for I know of when you go and where.\"        VIII.  The Mildness of the Yellow Press    There is a great deal of protest made from one quarter or another  nowadays against the influence of that new journalism which is  associated with the names of Sir Alfred Harmsworth and Mr. Pearson. But  almost everybody who attacks it attacks on the ground that it is very  sensational, very violent and vulgar and startling. I am speaking in no  affected contrariety, but in the simplicity of a genuine personal  impression, when I say that this journalism offends as being not  sensational or violent enough.  The real vice is not that it is  startling, but that it is quite insupportably tame. The whole object is  to keep carefully along a certain level of the expected and the  commonplace; it may be low, but it must take care also to be flat.  Never by any chance in it is there any of that real plebeian pungency  which can be heard from the ordinary cabman in the ordinary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith (#13)"],[1,"are. No other name under heaven is given  but that of Jesus Christ, by which you can be saved or exalted in  the kingdom of God. Not only has God declared them, not only has  Christ declared these principles, by his voice to his disciples, from  generation to generation, in the old time, but in these latter days,  they have taken up the same testimony and declared these things to the  world. They are true today as they were then, and we must obey these  things.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 14, p. 548.    REVELATION AND LEGAL EVIDENCE. Recently a man charged with the murder  of another man was examined before a committing magistrate in Salt Lake  City. The father-in-law of the murdered man, during the examination  on the part of the State, related a conversation had between himself  and the accused soon after the commission of the crime. During the  conversation, according to newspaper report, the father-in-law of  the murdered man laid the crime at the door of the accused. In the  cross-examination the attorney for the defendant pressed the witness as  to how he knew that the accused was guilty of the crime. The reply, as  given in the press, was, because God had revealed it to him. It does  not appear from the further proceedings in the case that the testimony  was excepted to or withdrawn, or that the magistrate informed the  witness that such evidence was incompetent and could not be received.  The statement {50} gave rise to comment in the press and has been the  subject of discourse from the pulpit. Of course, every person must know  that such evidence is not admissible in a court of law, and if it had  been in a trial before a jury it would have been the duty of the judge  to order the testimony stricken out, and in the charge to the jury,  they would have been warned to disregard it altogether. In view of the  probability that there are those who may persist in the association  of such evidence with the religious body of which the witness is a  member, it may be proper to say, without discrediting in the least the  witness' conviction of the revelation he had received, that no member  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints should, for one  moment, regard such testimony as admissible in a court of law, and  to make the case perfectly clear it may be further stated that such  evidence would not be permissible even in a Church court, where rules  of evidence, though not so technical, are founded largely upon the same  principles that govern the rules of evidence in a court of law. Any  attempt, therefore, to make it appear that such evidence is in keeping  with the tenets of the \"Mormon\" faith is wholly unjustified.--_Juvenile  Instructor,_ p. 114, Feb. 15, 1902, Vol. 37.    PROPER CHANNELS FOR REVELATION. It has sometimes been sorrowful to see  respected members of the Church, men who should know better, allow  themselves to become the tools of seductive spirits. Such men seem,  for the time at least, to lose sight of the fact that the Lord has  established on earth the Priesthood in its fulness; and that by direct  revelation and commandment from heaven; that he has instituted an  order or government that is beyond the capacity, and that is superior  to the wisdom and learning and understanding of man, so far, indeed,  that it seems impossible for the human mind, unaided by the Spirit of  God, to comprehend the beauties, powers, and character of the Holy  Priesthood. It seems difficult for men to comprehend the workings {51}  of the priesthood, its legitimate authority, its scope and power; and  yet by the light of the Spirit it is easily comprehended, but not  understanding it, men are easily deceived by seductive spirits that are  abroad in the world. They are led to believe that something is wrong,  and the next thing that transpires, they find themselves believing that  they are chosen specially to set things right. It is very unfortunate  for a man to be taken in this snare; for be it understood by the  Latter-day Saints that as long as the servants of God are living pure  lives, are honoring the priesthood conferred upon them, and endeavoring  to the best of their knowledge to magnify their offices and callings,  to which they have been duly chosen by the voice of the people and  the priesthood, and sanctioned by the approval of God, so long as the  Lord has any communication to make to the children of men, or any  instructions to impart to his Church, he will make such communication  through the legally appointed channel of the priesthood; he will never  go outside of it, as long, at least, as the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints exists in its present form on the earth.    It is not the business of any individual to rise up as a revelator,  as a prophet, as a seer, as an inspired man, to give revelation for  the guidance of the Church, or to assume to dictate to the presiding  authorities of the Church in any part of the world, much less in the  midst of Zion, where the organizations of the priesthood are about  perfect, where everything is complete, even to the organization  of a branch. It is the right of individuals to be inspired and  to receive manifestations of the Holy Spirit for their personal  guidance to strengthen their faith, and to encourage them in works  of righteousness, in being faithful and observing and keeping the  commandments which God has given unto them; it is the privilege of  every man and woman to receive revelation to this end, but not further.  The moment an individual rises up assuming the right to {52} control  and to dictate, or to sit in judgment on his brethren, especially upon  those who preside, he should be promptly checked, or discord, division  and confusion will be the result. Every man and woman in this Church  should know better than to yield to such a spirit; the moment that such  a feeling presents itself to them they should rebuke it, as it is in  direct antagonism to the order of the priesthood, and to the spirit and  genius of this work. We can accept nothing as authoritative but that  which comes directly through the appointed channel, the constituted  organizations of the priesthood, which is the channel that God has  appointed through which to make known his mind and will to the world.    Through Joseph, then, the Lord revealed himself to the world, and  through him he chose the first elders of the Church--men who were  honest in their hearts; men who he knew would receive the word, and  labor in connection with Joseph in this great, important undertaking;  and all that have been ordained to the priesthood, and all that have  been appointed to any position whatever in this Church have received  their authority and commission through this channel, appointed of  God, with Joseph at the head. This is the order, and it could not be  otherwise. God will not raise up another prophet and another people to  do the work that we have been appointed to do. He will never ignore  those who have stood firm and true from the commencement, as it were,  of this work, and who are still firm and faithful, inasmuch as they  continue faithful to their trust. There is no question in my mind of  their ever proving themselves unfaithful, as a body, for if any of  them were to become unworthy in his sight, he would remove them out of  their place and call others from the ranks to fill their positions.  And thus his priesthood will ever be found to be composed of the right  men for the place, of men whose backs will be fitted for the burden,  men through whom he can work and regulate {53} the affairs of his  Church according to the counsels of his own will. And the moment that  individuals look to any other source, that moment they throw themselves  open to the seductive influences of Satan, and render themselves liable  to become servants of the devil; they lose sight of the true order  through which the blessings of the priesthood are to be enjoyed; they  step outside of the pale of the kingdom of God, and are on dangerous  ground. Whenever you see a man rise up claiming to have received direct  revelation from the Lord to the Church, independent of the order and  channel of the priesthood, you may set him down as an impostor. God  has not called you to go out to the world to be taught, or to receive  revelations through apostates or strangers; but he has called and  ordained you and sent you forth to teach and lead people in the paths  of righteousness and salvation.    Now, how should it be? I will tell you. In the first place every person  should know that the gospel is true, as this is every one's privilege  who is baptized and receives the Holy Ghost. A man may be grieved in  his feelings because of some difficulty between himself and President  Taylor, or Cannon, or myself; he may have feelings in his heart which  lead him to think that he could not sustain us in his faith and  prayers; but if this should be the case, what is the course for him to  pursue? He should say in his heart, \"God has established his kingdom,  and his priesthood is upon the earth; and notwithstanding my dislike  for certain men, I know that the gospel is true, and that God is with  his people; and that if I will do my duty and keep his commandments,  the clouds will roll by, and the mists will disappear, the Spirit of  the Lord will come more fully to my relief, and by and by I will be  able to see--if I am in error, wherein I erred, and then I will repent  of it, for I know that every wrong thing will yet be made right.\" I  think all men should feel that way.    Never is there but one appointed at a time to hold the {54} keys of  the kingdom of God pertaining to the earth. While Christ remained on  the earth he held them; but when he departed, he committed them to  Peter, he being the president or chief of the apostles; and it was  his right to direct and to receive revelation for the Church, and  to give counsel to all the brethren.
