But, not to insist on that, have you not been  allowed to take Matter in what sense you pleased? And have you not used  this privilege in the utmost extent; sometimes entirely changing, at  others leaving out, or putting into the definition of it whatever, for  the present, best served your design, contrary to all the known rules of  reason and logic? And hath not this shifting, unfair method of yours spun  out our dispute to an unnecessary length; Matter having been particularly  examined, and by your own confession refuted in each of those senses? And  can any more be required to prove the absolute impossibility of a thing,  than the proving it impossible in every particular sense that either you  or any one else understands it in?    HYL.  But I am not so thoroughly satisfied that you have proved the  impossibility of Matter, in the last most obscure abstracted and  indefinite sense.    PHIL. . When is a thing shewn to be impossible?    HYL.  When a repugnancy is demonstrated between the ideas comprehended  in its definition.    PHIL.  But where there are no ideas, there no repugnancy can be  demonstrated between ideas?    HYL.  I agree with you.    PHIL.  Now, in that which you call the obscure indefinite sense of the  word MATTER, it is plain, by your own confession, there was  included no idea at all, no sense except an unknown sense; which is the  same thing as none. You are not, therefore, to expect I should prove a  repugnancy between ideas, where there are no ideas; or the impossibility  of Matter taken in an UNKNOWN sense, that is, no sense at all. My  business was only to shew you meant NOTHING; and this you were brought  to own. So that, in all your various senses, you have been shewed either  to mean nothing at all, or, if anything, an absurdity. And if this be not  sufficient to prove the impossibility of a thing, I desire you will let  me know what is.    HYL.  I acknowledge you have proved that Matter is impossible; nor do I  see what more can be said in defence of it. But, at the same time that I  give up this, I suspect all my other notions. For surely none could be  more seemingly evident than this once was: and yet it now seems as false  and absurd as ever it did true before. But I think we have discussed the  point sufficiently for the present. The remaining part of the day I would  willingly spend in running over in my thoughts the several heads of this  morning's conversation, and tomorrow shall be glad to meet you here again  about the same time.    PHIL.  I will not fail to attend you.          THE THIRD DIALOGUE      PHILONOUS.  Tell me, Hylas, what are the fruits of yesterday's  meditation? Has it confirmed you in the same mind you were in at parting?  or have you since seen cause to change your opinion?    HYLAS.  Truly my opinion is that all our opinions are alike vain and  uncertain. What we approve to-day, we condemn to-morrow. We keep a stir  about knowledge, and spend our lives in the pursuit of it, when, alas I  we know nothing all the while: nor do I think it possible for us ever to  know anything in this life. Our faculties are too narrow and too few.  Nature certainly never intended us for speculation.    PHIL.  What! Say you we can know nothing, Hylas?    HYL.  There is not that single thing in the world whereof we can know  the real nature, or what it is in itself.    PHIL.  Will you tell me I do not really know what fire or water is?    HYL.  You may indeed know that fire appears hot, and water fluid; but  this is no more than knowing what sensations are produced in your own  mind, upon the application of fire and water to your organs of sense.  Their internal constitution, their true and real nature, you are utterly  in the dark as to THAT.    PHIL.  Do I not know this to be a real stone that I stand on, and that  which I see before my eyes to be a real tree?    HYL.  KNOW? No, it is impossible you or any man alive should know it.  All you know is, that you have such a certain idea or appearance in your  own mind. But what is this to the real tree or stone? I tell you that  colour, figure, and hardness, which you perceive, are not the real  natures of those things, or in the least like them. The same may be said  of all other real things, or corporeal substances, which compose the  world. They have none of them anything of themselves, like those sensible  qualities by us perceived. We should not therefore pretend to affirm or  know anything of them, as they are in their own nature.    PHIL.  But surely, Hylas, I can distinguish gold, for example,  from iron: and how could this be, if I knew not what either truly was?    HYL.  Believe me, Philonous, you can only distinguish between your own  ideas. That yellowness, that weight, and other sensible qualities, think  you they are really in the gold? They are only relative to the senses,  and have no absolute existence in nature. And in pretending to  distinguish the species of real things, by the appearances in your mind,  you may perhaps act as wisely as he that should conclude two men were of  a different species, because their clothes were not of the same colour.    PHIL.  It seems, then, we are altogether put off with the appearances of  things, and those false ones too. The very meat I eat, and the cloth I  wear, have nothing in them like what I see and feel.    HYL.  Even so.    PHIL.  But is it not strange the whole world should be thus imposed on,  and so foolish as to believe their senses? And yet I know not how it is,  but men eat, and drink, and sleep, and perform all the offices of life,  as comfortably and conveniently as if they really knew the things they  are conversant about.    HYL.  They do so: but you know ordinary practice does not require a  nicety of speculative knowledge. Hence the vulgar retain their mistakes,  and for all that make a shift to bustle through the affairs of life. But  philosophers know better things.    PHIL.  You mean, they KNOW that they KNOW NOTHING.    HYL.  That is the very top and perfection of human knowledge.    PHIL.  But are you all this while in earnest, Hylas; and are you  seriously persuaded that you know nothing real in the world? Suppose you  are going to write, would you not call for pen, ink, and paper, like  another man; and do you not know what it is you call for?    HYL.  How often must I tell you, that I know not the real nature of any  one thing in the universe? I may indeed upon occasion make use of pen,  ink, and paper. But what any one of them is in its own true nature, I  declare positively I know not. And the same is true with regard to every  other corporeal thing. And, what is more, we are not only ignorant of the  true and real nature of things, but even of their existence. It cannot be  denied that we perceive such certain appearances or ideas; but it cannot  be concluded from thence that bodies really exist. Nay, now I think  on it, I must, agreeably to my former concessions, farther declare that  it is impossible any REAL corporeal thing should exist in nature.    PHIL.  You amaze me. Was ever anything more wild and extravagant than  the notions you now maintain: and is it not evident you are led into all  these extravagances by the belief of MATERIAL SUBSTANCE? This makes you  dream of those unknown natures in everything. It is this occasions your  distinguishing between the reality and sensible appearances of things. It  is to this you are indebted for being ignorant of what everybody else  knows perfectly well. Nor is this all: you are not only ignorant of the  true nature of everything, but you know not whether anything really  exists, or whether there are any true natures at all; forasmuch as you  attribute to your material beings an absolute or external existence,  wherein you suppose their reality consists. And, as you are forced in the  end to acknowledge such an existence means either a direct repugnancy, or  nothing at all, it follows that you are obliged to pull down your own  hypothesis of material Substance, and positively to deny the real  existence of any part of the universe. And so you are plunged into the  deepest and most deplorable scepticism that ever man was. Tell me, Hylas,  is it not as I say?    HYL.  I agree with you. MATERIAL SUBSTANCE was no more than an  hypothesis; and a false and groundless one too. I will no longer spend my  breath in defence of it. But whatever hypothesis you advance, or  whatsoever scheme of things you introduce in its stead, I doubt not it  will appear every whit as false: let me but be allowed to question you  upon it. That is, suffer me to serve you in your own kind, and I warrant  it shall conduct you through as many perplexities and contradictions, to  the very same state of scepticism that I myself am in at present.    PHIL.  I assure you, Hylas, I do not pretend to frame any hypothesis at  all. I am of a vulgar cast, simple enough to believe my senses, and leave  things as I find them. To be plain, it is my opinion that the real things  are those very things I see, and feel, and perceive by my senses. These I  know; and, finding they answer all the necessities and purposes of life,  have no reason to be solicitous about any other unknown beings. A piece  of sensible bread, for instance, would stay my stomach better than ten  thousand times as much of that insensible, unintelligible, real bread you  speak of. It is likewise my opinion that colours and other sensible  qualities are on the objects. I cannot for my life help thinking  that snow is white, and fire hot. You indeed, who by SNOW and fire mean  certain external, unperceived, unperceiving substances, are in the right  to deny whiteness or heat to be affections inherent in THEM. But I, who  understand by those words the things I see and feel, am obliged to think  like other folks. And, as I am no sceptic with regard to the nature of  things, so neither am I as to their existence. That a thing should be  really perceived by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#13)"],[1,"h, what COULD it mean?    \"Bunty.\"    Again the name sounded.  Louder this time, but in a tired voice,  that struck him some way with a strange thrill.  The rustling grew  louder, something was getting over the partition, crossing the  floor, coming towards him.  He gave a sob of terror and flung  himself face downwards on the ground, hiding his little blanched  face among the straw.    \"Bunty,\" said the voice again, and a light hand touched his arm.    \"Help me--HELP me!\" he shrieked.  \"Meg--oh! Father--Esther!\"    But one hand was hastily put over his mouth and another pulled him  into a sitting position.    He had shut his eyes very tightly, so as not to see the ghostly  visitant that he knew had come to punish him for his sin.  But  something made him open them, and then he felt he could never  close them again for amazement.    For, it was Judy's hand that was over his mouth, and Judy's self  that was standing beside him.    \"My golly!\" he said, in a tone of stupefaction.  He stared hard  at her to make sure she was real flesh and blood.  \"However did  you get here?\"    But Judy made no answer.  She merely took the remaining apple  and cake from his hand, and, sitting down, devoured them in  silence.    \"Haven't you got any more?\" she said anxiously.  Then he  noticed what a tall, gaunt, strange-looking Judy it was.  Her  clothes were hanging round her almost in tatters, her boots were  burst and white with dust, her brown face was thin and sharp,  and her hair matted and rough.    \"My golly!\" the little boy said again, his eyes threatening  to start out of his head--\"my golly, Judy, what have you been  doin'?\"    \"I--I've run away, Bunty,\" Judy said, in a quavering voice.  \"I've walked all the way from school.  I wanted to see you all  so badly.\"    \"My jiggery!\" Bunty said.    \"I've thought it all out,\" Judy continued, pushing back her hair  in a weary moray.  \"I can't quite remember everything just now,  I am so tired, but everything will be all right.\"    \"But what'll he say?\" Bunty said with frightened eyes, as a  vision of his father crossed his mind.    \"He won't know, of course,\" Judy returned, in a matter-of-fact  manner.  \"I shall just live here in this loft for a time, and  you can all come to see me and bring me food and things, and then  presently I'll go back to school.\"  She sank down among the straw  and shut her eyes in an exhausted way for a minute or two, and  Bunty watched her half fascinated.    \"How far is it from your school?\" he said at last.    \"Seventy-seven miles.\"  Judy shuddered a little.  \"I got a lift  in a luggage train from Lawson to Springwood, and a ride in a cart  for a little way, but I walked the rest.  I've been nearly a week  coming,\" she added after a pause, and shut her eyes again for quite  a long time.  Then a tear or two of weakness and self-pity trickled  from beneath her black lashes, and made a little clean mark down her  cheeks.  Bunty's throat swelled at the sight of them, he had never  seen Judy cry as long as he could remember.  He patted her thin  hand, he rubbed his head against her shoulder, and said, \"Never  mind, old girl,\" in a thick voice.    But that brought, half a dozen great heavy drop hurrying down from  beneath the closed lashes, and the girl turned over and lay face  downwards to hide them.  Then she struggled up to a sitting position  and actually began to laugh.    \"IF the Miss Burtons could see me!\" she said.  \"Oh, I've managed  everything so beautifully; they think I'm spending a fortnight at  Katoomba--oh, BUNTY, you ought to see the curls Miss Marian Burton  wears plastered at each side of her cheeks!\"  She broke off,  laughing almost hysterically, and then coughing till the tears came  back in her eyes.    \"Do go and get me something to eat,\" she said crossly, when she got  her breath--\"you might remember I've had nothing to eat since  yesterday morning; only you always were selfish, Bunty.\"    He got up and moved away in a great hurry.  \"What could you eat?  what shall I get?\"  he said, and put one leg down the trap-door.    \"Anything so long as it's a lot,\" she said--\"ANYTHING!--I feel I  could eat this straw, and crunch up the beams as if they were  biscuits.  I declare I've had to keep my eyes off you, Bunty;  you're so fat I keep longing to pick your bones.\"    Her eyes shone with a spark of their old fun, but then she began to  cough again, and, after the paroxysm had passed, lay back exhausted.    \"Do fetch some of the others,\" she called faintly, as his head was  disappearing.  \"You're not much good alone, you know.\"    His head bobbed back a moment, and he tried to smile away the pain  her words gave him, for just at that minute he would have died for  her without a murmur.    \"I'm awf'ly sorry, Judy,\" he said gently, \"but the others are  all out.  Wouldn't I do?  I'd do anything, Judy please.\"    Judy disregarded the little sniffle that accompanied the last  words, and turned her face to the wall.    Two big tears trickled down again.    \"They MIGHT have stayed in,\" she said with a sob.  \"They might  have known I should try to come.  Where are they?\"    \"Pip's gone fishing,\" he said, \"and Nell's carrying the basket  for him.  And Baby's at the Courtneys', and Esther's gone to town  with the General.  Oh, and Meg's ill in bed, because her stays were  too tight last night and she fainted.\"    \"I suppose they haven't missed me a scrap,\" was her bitter  thought, when she heard how everything seemed going on as usual,  while she had been living through so much just to see them all.    Then the odd feeling of faintness came back, and she closed her  eyes again and lay motionless, forgetful of time, place, or hunger.    Bunty sped across the paddock on winged feet; the sight of his  father near the stables gave him a momentary shock, and brought  his own trouble to mind, but he shook it off again and hurried on.  The pantry door was locked.  Martha, the cook, kept it in that  condition generally on account of his own sinful propensities  for making away with her tarts and cakes; it was only by  skilful stratagem he could ever get in, as he remembered  dejectedly.    But Judy's hunger!  Nothing to eat since yesterday morning!    He remembered, with a feeling of pain even now, the horrible  sinking sensation he had experienced last week when for punishment  he had been sent to bed without his tea.  And Judy had forgone  three meals!  He shut his lips tightly, and a light of almost  heroic resolve came into his eyes.  Round at the side of the house  was the window to the pantry; he had often gazed longingly up at it,  but had never ventured to attempt the ascent, for there was a  horrible cactus creeper up the wall.    But now for Judy's sake he would do it or die.  He marched round  the house and up to the side window; no one was about, the whole  place seemed very quiet.  Martha, as he had seen, was cooking in  the kitchen, and the other girl was whitening the front veranda.  He gave one steady look at the great spiky thorns, and the next  minute was climbing up among them.    Oh, how they pierced and tore him!  There was a great, jagged  wound up one arm, his left stocking was ripped away and a deep  red scratch showed across his leg, his hands were bleeding and  quivering with pain.    But he had reached the sill, and that was everything.    He pushed up the narrow window, and with much difficulty  forced his little fat body through.  Then he dropped down on to  a shelf, and lowered himself gingerly on to the floor.  There was  no time to stay to look at his many hurts, he merely regarded  the biggest scratch with rueful eyes, and then began to look around  for provender.  The pantry was remarkably empty--not a sign of  cakes, not a bit of jelly, not a remnant of fowl anywhere.  He cut  a great piece off a loaf, and carefully wrapped some butter in a  scrap of newspaper.  There was some corned beef on a dish, and he  cut off a thick lump and rolled it up with the remains of a  loquat tart.  These parcels he disposed of down the loose front of  his sailor coat, filling up his pockets with sultanas, citron-peel,  currants, and such dainties as the store bottles held.  And then  he prepared to make his painful retreat.    He climbed upon the shelf once more, put his head out of the  window, and gave a look of despair at the cactus.  And even as  he knelt there sounded behind him the sharp click of a turning  key.    He looked wildly round, and there was Martha in the doorway, and  to his utter horror she was talking to his father, who was in the  passage just beyond.    \"Row's Embrocation, or arnica,\" the Captain was saying.  \"It is  probably in this pantry, my good girl, because it is the last  place I should expect it to be in.  I left it on my bedroom  mantelpiece, but somebody has seen fit to meddle with it.  Why  in the name of all that is mysterious can't you let my things  alone?\"    \"And for what should I be after moving it for?\"  Martha retorted.  \"I don't mix the pastry with it to make it lightsome, leastway  not ordinarily.\"    She tossed her head, and the action revealed the small, kneeling,  terrified figure at the window.  Now the door was only half open,  and her master was standing just beside it outside, so she only  had the benefit of the spectacle.    Twice she opened her mouth to speak, but Bunty made such  frantic, imploring faces at her than she closed it again, and  even began to examine the bottles on the shelf near the door to  give the boy an opportunity of retreat.    One minute and he would, have been safe--one minute and he would  have been in the thick of the cactus, that had quite lost its terrors.    But the Fates were too strong for him.  And all because Martha  Tomlinson's shoe was don at the heel.  In turning round it twisted  a little under her, and, in trying to recover her balance, she put  out one hand.  And in putting out one hand she knocked over a jug.  And the jug communicated its shock"]]]
