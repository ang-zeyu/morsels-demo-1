But neither Mrs. Botha nor any one else should be led to       suppose that we could consider terms more favourable to the       Boers than those which have been rejected. The Secretary of       State for War will send a copy of this to Kitchener.\"    That the negotiations were looked upon with disfavour by all parties  concerned is undoubted. A letter written by one of Reuter's  correspondents expresses the very general view taken by the British in  the field:--         \"The Parliamentary paper giving particulars of the peace       negotiations has been eagerly read by all ranks of the Army. It       is impossible to shut one's eyes to the fact that the British       forces now operating in South Africa are profoundly       dissatisfied with them. On all hands, and from all ranks, the       same complaint is heard, that they are too lenient, and are not       calculated to bring permanent peace to South Africa. There is       no bitterness against the Boers; that feeling has long ago died       out, but when the men came to read the terms of peace proposed       by the British Government, they remembered their dead comrades       whose graves mark the line of march, and asked themselves: 'Is       it for this that they have died?' The Army, which has undergone       countless hardships and dangers, is less articulate than a       municipal body in England, but surely it should have its say.       The regular Army, perhaps, is expected not to think or to       express its thought about politics, but to fight, and only to       fight; but the South Africans, the Canadians, and the       Australians will give expression to their sentiments. They       declare that in the terms of peace offered by the British       Government there are all the elements of future rebellion and       unrest. 'Give the Boers,' they say, 'even more than we have       promised them, but let it be as a free gift after surrender,       and not as a condition of surrender.' Curiously enough, these       sentiments are shared entirely by the Burghers who have       surrendered, and who are only waiting for the end of       hostilities to take their places as British subjects,       determined to do their utmost for the peaceful development of a       country which, under British rule, will be as much theirs as       anybody else's. One of them, speaking to me the other day, put       forward his view of the case. 'If the British grant terms to       those burghers now under arms,' he said, 'they at once       establish for all time a confession of weakness. We shall tell       each other and our children that we have never been beaten,       and, as we increase in numbers, the tales of former prowess and       invincibility will perpetuate a national feeling. If you allow       burghers to carry rifles after surrender you will have petty       revolts for the next ten years. There is no need of a Mauser or       a Lee-Metford to defend the burgher against the native. Give       him a shot-gun or a revolver, and no native will molest him.       The demand for the retention of arms is nothing more nor less       than the result of a determination on the part of the Boers to       use them against you at the very slightest provocation. To give       them rifles is suicidal.'\"          CHAPTER IV    IN THE WESTERN TRANSVAAL--JANUARY TO MAY      In the early part of the year we find Lord Methuen busily occupied in  dealing with an incursion of the enemy from the south-western part of  the Transvaal into Griqualand. Operating from Vryburg and Taungs, he,  with his mobile columns, performed an incalculable amount of work. He  withdrew the garrison from Schweitzer Reneke, routed the Boers that  were surrounding Daniel's Knil, provisioned the garrison of Kuruman,  and eventually hunted De Villiers' hordes into the Transvaal. That  done, he marched in the beginning of February, _via_ Wolmaranstad, to  Klerksdorp, following up and dispersing the aforesaid hordes as he  went. At Hartebeestefontein he came very violently into collision with  them, and though they made a stout effort to resist his advance, he  forced them to give way. His captures during these proceedings  amounted to forty prisoners and many thousand head of stock. Lord  Methuen reached Klerksdorp on the 19th of February and went on to  Potchefstroom, where he commenced co-operating with the sweeping  movements of Generals Babington and Cunningham. These officers, on  General French's departure from the western side of the Transvaal,  held a line from Oliphant's Nek to Ventersdorp and Potchefstroom, and  kept an eye on the machinations of Delarey and other malcontents in  these regions. In spite of their vigilance a concentration was  effected in the Gatsrand on the 31st, and a small force at  Modderfontein was overwhelmed by superior numbers before General  Cunningham could come to its relief. Two more small columns, the one  under Colonel Shekleton, South Lancashire Regiment, the other under  Colonel Benson, R.A., were now placed at the disposal of General  Cunningham to help in the work of clearing the ground between the  western railway line and the Vaal.           *       *       *       *       *    At the end of February Lord Methuen's force, together with the small  column under Colonel Benson, was actively engaged in hunting bands of  marauders in the triangle--Klerksdorp, Potchefstroom, Ventersdorp. On  the 4th of March the troops marched from Klerksdorp towards Hoopstad,  thence to withdraw the garrison. _En route_ they, having left their  convoy under strong escort on the road to Commando Drift, made a night  descent on Wolmaranstad with the intention of liberating the British  and Boer State prisoners who were known to be detained there. But at  dawn when they arrived they discovered that the place was deserted!  The sole, though not unimportant, result of their exertions was the  capture of the Landdrost, Pearson, a person who had rendered himself  notorious in connection with the cases of Messrs. M'Lachlan and Boyd,  who with three burghers were shot at Wolmaranstad. The particulars of  the dastardly murder of these men must be recorded, as they serve to  show the innate brutality of the Boers, which in the earlier part of  the war had been suppressed in hope to seduce the sympathy of the  Powers. The news of the execution of five British subjects--so-called  rebels--by Delarey's commando was brought to Klerksdorp by Mrs.  M'Lachlan, whose husband, father, and brother-in-law had been among  the victims. Most of them were burghers who had surrendered or left  the country prior to the war, while the others were alleged to have  taken up arms. The man Boyd, a British subject, had been detained in  jail since July 1900 by the Landdrost, who induced him, with two  others, to indite a message to the English praying them to come to  their rescue. This was afterwards made the plea for sentencing the  three to death. Among others sentenced were two burghers named  Theunissen, well-known farmers of Klerksdorp, who had surrendered with  General Andreas Cronje's commando in June, and had taken the oath of  neutrality and refused to break it. Mrs. M'Lachlan, the daughter of  the elder Theunissen, gave an account of her loss, narrating how she  had taken coffins to the place of execution to bury the bodies of her  father, brother, and husband, to whom she had been married only two  years, while another lady made the following statement:--\"The Boers  have forty of our men prisoners there. Eight or ten have been  condemned to be shot. They were tried by the late Landdrost of  Klerksdorp, a man named Heethling, in conjunction with other members  of the Court. The sentences were confirmed by Generals Smuts and  Delarey, who sent men to carry them out. The four who were shot were  Mr. Theunissen, his son, his son-in-law, Mr. M'Lachlan, and Mr. Boyd.  From first to last they were most brutally treated. The execution was  a sad spectacle. The prisoners, on being taken out of jail, grasped  one another's hands. They were placed in a row and shot down one by  one. Mr. Boyd received three bullets, but was still alive when put  into the grave. The Boers then fired again, and all was over. It was  nearly being my husband's fate, but, thank God, he escaped. Mr. George  Savage was also condemned to be shot, but he has been insane since his  trial. His wife has gone with Mrs. Pienaar to try to get the sentence  commuted. Mrs. Pienaar being with her may possibly have some  influence.\"    From all accounts it appeared that the man Pearson, who was  captured by Lord Methuen, was prime actor in the barbarous drama, and,  handcuffed, he was removed to await his trial.    [Illustration: CECIL J. RHODES AT GROOTE SCHUUR.    A Memory.    From \"War Impressions\" by Mortimer Menpes, by arrangement with Messrs  A. & C. Black].    The column while returning to the convoy was attacked by a commando of  some 400, under Du Tot and Potgeiter, from the hills, who paid for their  presumption by losing eleven killed and wounded to our seven--a price  seldom paid by these bands of \"artful dodgers.\" Finding the river  impassable at Commando Drift, the troops marched along the right bank of  the Vaal in hopes to cross lower down. The drifts, Bloemhof and  Christiana, were also not negotiable, and finally the force moved to  Fourteen Streams and crossed by the railway bridge. Brigadier-General  the Earl of Errol now assumed command of the force, as Lord Methuen was  placed on the sick list.    Here it must be noted, that after the departure of Lord Methuen for  Hoopstad, Colonel Benson continued to operate to the south of the  railway in the Gatsrand, and along the right bank of the Vaal. His  small yet active column was ever in touch with the Boers, and many of  them had hair-breadth escapes, yet, in spite of all, they secured many  prisoners, 1090 head of cattle, and forty-five waggons. On the 4th of  April"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4715"],[0,"An African Millionaire: Episodes in the Life of the Illustrious Colonel Clay (#13)"],[1,"n,\" I answered, \"just to oblige  your Serenity.\"    A secretary, after all, can do a great deal. When it came to the  scratch, I had but little difficulty in persuading Sir Charles, with  Amelia's aid, backed up on either side by Isabel and Cesarine, to  accede to the Count's more reasonable proposal. The Southampton Row  people had possession of certain facts as to the value of the wines  in the Bordeaux market which clinched the matter. In a week or two  all was settled; Charles and I met the Count by appointment in  Southampton Row, and saw him sign, seal, and deliver the title-deeds  of Schloss Lebenstein. My brother-in-law paid the purchase-money  into the Count's own hands, by cheque, crossed on a first-class  London firm where the Count kept an account to his high well-born  order. Then he went away with the proud knowledge that he was owner  of Schloss Lebenstein. And what to me was more important still,  I received next morning by post a cheque for the five per cent,  unfortunately drawn, by some misapprehension, to my order on the  self-same bankers, and with the Count's signature. He explained in  the accompanying note that the matter being now quite satisfactorily  concluded, he saw no reason of delicacy why the amount he had  promised should not be paid to me forthwith direct in money.    I cashed the cheque at once, and said nothing about the affair, not  even to Isabel. My experience is that women are not to be trusted  with intricate matters of commission and brokerage.    Though it was now late in March, and the House was sitting, Charles  insisted that we must all run over at once to take possession of our  magnificent Tyrolese castle. Amelia was almost equally burning with  eagerness. She gave herself the airs of a Countess already. We took  the Orient Express as far as Munich; then the Brenner to Meran,  and put up for the night at the Erzherzog Johann. Though we had  telegraphed our arrival, and expected some fuss, there was no  demonstration. Next morning we drove out in state to the schloss,  to enter into enjoyment of our vines and fig-trees.    We were met at the door by the surly steward. \"I shall dismiss  that man,\" Charles muttered, as Lord of Lebenstein. \"He's too  sour-looking for my taste. Never saw such a brute. Not a smile  of welcome!\"    He mounted the steps. The surly man stepped forward and murmured a  few morose words in German. Charles brushed him aside and strode on.  Then there followed a curious scene of mutual misunderstanding. The  surly man called lustily for his servants to eject us. It was some  time before we began to catch at the truth. The surly man was the  _real_ Graf von Lebenstein.    And the Count with the moustache? It dawned upon us now. Colonel  Clay again! More audacious than ever!    Bit by bit it all came out. He had ridden behind us the first day  we viewed the place, and, giving himself out to the servants as  one of our party, had joined us in the reception-room. We asked  the real Count why he had spoken to the intruder. The Count  explained in French that the man with the moustache had introduced  my brother-in-law as the great South African millionaire, while he  described himself as our courier and interpreter. As such he had  had frequent interviews with the real Graf and his lawyers in  Meran, and had driven almost daily across to the castle. The owner  of the estate had named one price from the first, and had stuck to  it manfully. He stuck to it still; and if Sir Charles chose to buy  Schloss Lebenstein over again he was welcome to have it. How the  London lawyers had been duped the Count had not really the slightest  idea. He regretted the incident, and (coldly) wished us a very good  morning.    There was nothing for it but to return as best we might to the  Erzherzog Johann, crestfallen, and telegraph particulars to the  police in London.    Charles and I ran across post-haste to England to track down the  villain. At Southampton Row we found the legal firm by no means  penitent; on the contrary, they were indignant at the way we had  deceived them. An impostor had written to them on Lebenstein  paper from Meran to say that he was coming to London to negotiate  the sale of the schloss and surrounding property with the  famous millionaire, Sir Charles Vandrift; and Sir Charles had  demonstratively recognised him at sight as the real Count von  Lebenstein. The firm had never seen the present Graf at all, and  had swallowed the impostor whole, so to speak, on the strength of  Sir Charles's obvious recognition. He had brought over as documents  some most excellent forgeries--facsimiles of the originals--which,  as our courier and interpreter, he had every opportunity of  examining and inspecting at the Meran lawyers'. It was a deeply-laid  plot, and it had succeeded to a marvel. Yet, all of it depended  upon the one small fact that we had accepted the man with the long  moustache in the hall of the schloss as the Count von Lebenstein on  his own representation.    He held our cards in his hands when he came in; and the servant had  _not_ given them to him, but to the genuine Count. That was the one  unsolved mystery in the whole adventure.    By the evening's post two letters arrived for us at Sir Charles's  house: one for myself, and one for my employer. Sir Charles's ran  thus:--      \"HIGH WELL-BORN INCOMPETENCE,--    \"I only just pulled through! A very small slip nearly lost me  everything. I believed you were going to Schloss Planta that day,  not to Schloss Lebenstein. You changed your mind en route. That  might have spoiled all. Happily I perceived it, rode up by the short  cut, and arrived somewhat hurriedly and hotly at the gate before  you. Then I introduced myself. I had one more bad moment when the  rival claimant to my name and title intruded into the room. But  fortune favours the brave: your utter ignorance of German saved me.  The rest was pap. It went by itself almost.    \"Allow me, now, as some small return for your various welcome  cheques, to offer you a useful and valuable present--a German  dictionary, grammar, and phrase-book!    \"I kiss your hand.    \"No longer    \"VON LEBENSTEIN.\"      The other note was to me. It was as follows:--      \"DEAR GOOD MR. VENTVORTH,--    \"Ha, ha, ha; just a W misplaced sufficed to take you in, then! And  I risked the TH, though anybody with a head on his shoulders would  surely have known our TH is by far more difficult than our W for  foreigners! However, all's well that ends well; and now I've got  you. The Lord has delivered you into my hands, dear friend--on your  own initiative. I hold my cheque, endorsed by you, and cashed at my  banker's, as a hostage, so to speak, for your future good behaviour.  If ever you recognise me, and betray me to that solemn old ass, your  employer, remember, I expose it, and you with it to him. So now we  understand each other. I had not thought of this little dodge; it  was you who suggested it. However, I jumped at it. Was it not well  worth my while paying you that slight commission in return for a  guarantee of your future silence? Your mouth is now closed. And  cheap too at the price.--Yours, dear Comrade, in the great  confraternity of rogues,    \"CUTHBERT CLAY, Colonel.\"      Charles laid his note down, and grizzled. \"What's yours, Sey?\"  he asked.    \"From a lady,\" I answered.    He gazed at me suspiciously. \"Oh, I thought it was the same hand,\"  he said. His eye looked through me.    \"No,\" I answered. \"Mrs. Mortimer's.\" But I confess I trembled.    He paused a moment. \"You made all inquiries at this fellow's bank?\"  he went on, after a deep sigh.    \"Oh, yes,\" I put in quickly. (I had taken good care about that,  you may be sure, lest he should spot the commission.) \"They say  the self-styled Count von Lebenstein was introduced to them by  the Southampton Row folks, and drew, as usual, on the Lebenstein  account: so they were quite unsuspicious. A rascal who goes about  the world on that scale, you know, and arrives with such credentials  as theirs and yours, naturally imposes on anybody. The bank didn't  even require to have him formally identified. The firm was enough.  He came to pay money in, not to draw it out. And he withdrew his  balance just two days later, saying he was in a hurry to get back  to Vienna.\"    Would he ask for items? I confess I felt it was an awkward moment.  Charles, however, was too full of regrets to bother about the  account. He leaned back in his easy chair, stuck his hands in his  pockets, held his legs straight out on the fender before him, and  looked the very picture of hopeless despondency.    \"Sey,\" he began, after a minute or two, poking the fire,  reflectively, \"what a genius that man has! 'Pon my soul, I  admire him. I sometimes wish--\" He broke off and hesitated.    \"Yes, Charles?\" I answered.    \"I sometimes wish ... we had got him on the Board of the Cloetedorp  Golcondas. Mag--nificent combinations he would make in the City!\"    I rose from my seat and stared solemnly at my misguided  brother-in-law.    \"Charles,\" I said, \"you are beside yourself. Too much Colonel Clay  has told upon your clear and splendid intellect. There are certain  remarks which, however true they may be, no self-respecting  financier should permit himself to make, even in the privacy of  his own room, to his most intimate friend and trusted adviser.\"    Charles fairly broke down. \"You are right, Sey,\" he sobbed out.  \"Quite right. Forgive this outburst. At moments of emotion the  truth will sometimes out, in spite of everything.\"    I respected his feebleness. I did not even make it a fitting  occasion to ask for a trifling increase of salary.          V    THE EPISODE OF THE DRAWN GAME      The twelfth of August saw us, as usual, at Seldon Castle,  Ross-shire. It is part of Charles's restless, roving temperament  that, on the morning of the eleventh, wet or fine, he must set out  from London, whether the House is sitting or"]]]
