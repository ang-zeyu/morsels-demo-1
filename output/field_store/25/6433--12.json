After school that day the house literally  hummed. The noise of the two day-rooms talking it over could be heard  in the road outside. The only bar that stood between the outraged  Seymourites and Sheen was Drummond. As had happened before, Drummond  resolutely refused to allow anything in the shape of an active protest,  and no argument would draw him from this unreasonable attitude, though  why it was that he had taken it up he himself could not have said.  Perhaps it was that rooted hatred a boxer instinctively acquires of  anything in the shape of unfair play that influenced him. He revolted  against the idea of a whole house banding together against one of its  members.    So even this fresh provocation did not result in any active  interference with Sheen; but it was decided that he must be cut even  more thoroughly than before.    And about the time when this was resolved, Sheen was receiving the  congratulations of Francis on having positively landed a blow upon him.  It was an event which marked an epoch in his career.          XII    DUNSTABLE AND LINTON GO UP THE RIVER      There are some proud, spirited natures which resent rules and laws on  principle as attempts to interfere with the rights of the citizen. As  the Duchess in the play said of her son, who had had unpleasantness  with the authorities at Eton because they had been trying to teach him  things, \"Silwood is a sweet boy, but he will not stand the  bearing-rein\". Dunstable was also a sweet boy, but he, too, objected to  the bearing-rein. And Linton was a sweet boy, and he had similar  prejudices. And this placing of the town out of bounds struck both of  them simultaneously as a distinct attempt on the part of the headmaster  to apply the bearing-rein.    \"It's all very well to put it out of bounds for the kids,\" said  Dunstable, firmly, \"but when it comes to Us--why, I never heard of such  a thing.\"    Linton gave it as his opinion that such conduct was quite in a class of  its own as regarded cool cheek.    \"It fairly sneaks,\" said Linton, with forced calm, \"the Garibaldi.\"    \"Kids,\" proceeded Dunstable, judicially, \"are idiots, and can't be  expected to behave themselves down town. Put the show out of bounds to  them if you like. But We--\"    \"We!\" echoed Linton.    \"The fact is,\" said Dunstable, \"it's a beastly nuisance, but we shall  have to go down town and up the river just to assert ourselves. We  can't have the thin end of the wedge coming and spoiling our liberties.  We may as well chuck life altogether if we aren't able to go to the  town whenever we like.\"    \"And Albert will be pining away,\" added Linton.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Hullo, young gentlemen,\" said the town boatman, when they presented  themselves to him, \"what can I do for you?\"    \"I know it seems strange,\" said Dunstable, \"but we want a boat. We are  the Down-trodden British Schoolboys' League for Demanding Liberty and  seeing that We Get It. Have you a boat?\"    The man said he believed he had a boat. In fact, now that he came to  think of it, he rather fancied he had one or two. He proceeded to get  one ready, and the two martyrs to the cause stepped in.    Dunstable settled himself in the stern, and collected the rudder-lines.    \"Hullo,\" said Linton, \"aren't you going to row?\"    \"It may be only my foolish fancy,\" replied Dunstable, \"but I rather  think you're going to do that. I'll steer.\"    \"Beastly slacker,\" said Linton. \"Anyhow, how far are we going? I'm not  going to pull all night.\"    \"If you row for about half an hour without exerting yourself--and I can  trust you not to do that--and then look to your left, you'll see a  certain hostelry, if it hasn't moved since I was last there. It's  called the 'Blue Boar'. We will have tea there, and then I'll pull  gently back, and that will end the programme.\"    \"Except being caught in the town by half the masters,\" said Linton.  \"Still, I'm not grumbling. This had to be done. Ready?\"    \"Not just yet,\" said Dunstable, looking past Linton and up the  landing-stage. \"Wait just one second. Here are some friends of ours.\"    Linton looked over his shoulder.    \"Albert!\" he cried.    \"And the who struck me divers blows in sundry  places. Ah, they've sighted us.\"    \"What are you going to do? We can't have another scrap with them.\"    \"Far from it,\" said Dunstable gently. \"Hullo, Albert. _And_ my  friend in the moth-eaten bowler! This is well met.\"    \"You come out here,\" said Albert, pausing on the brink.    \"Why?\" asked Dunstable.    \"You see what you'll get.\"    \"But we don't want to see what we'll get. You've got such a narrow  mind, Albert--may I call you Bertie? You seem to think that nobody has  any pleasures except vulgar brawls. We are going to row up river, and  think beautiful thoughts.\"    Albert was measuring with his eye the distance between the boat and  landing-stage. It was not far. A sudden spring....    \"If you want a fight, go up to the school and ask for Mr Drummond. He's  the gentlemen who sent you to hospital last time. Any time you're  passing, I'm sure he'd--\"    Albert leaped.    But Linton had had him under observation, and, as he sprung, pushed  vigorously with his oar. The gap between boat and shore widened in an  instant, and Albert, failing to obtain a foothold on the boat, fell  back, with a splash that sent a cascade over his friend and the  boatman, into three feet of muddy water. By the time he had scrambled  out, his enemies were moving pensively up-stream.    The boatman was annoyed.    \"Makin' me wet and spoilin' my paint--what yer mean by it?\"    \"Me and my friend here we want a boat,\" said Albert, ignoring the main  issue.    \"Want a boat! Then you'll not get a boat. Spoil my cushions, too, would  you? What next, I wonder! You go to Smith and ask _him_ for a  boat. Perhaps he ain't so particular about having his cushions--\"    \"Orl right,\" said Albert, \"_orl_ right.\"    Mr Smith proved more complaisant, and a quarter of an hour after  Dunstable and Linton had disappeared, Albert and his friend were on the  water. Moist outside, Albert burned with a desire for Revenge. He meant  to follow his men till he found them. It almost seemed as if there  would be a repetition of the naval battle which had caused the town to  be put out of bounds. Albert was a quick-tempered youth, and he had  swallowed fully a pint of Severn water.           *       *       *       *       *    Dunstable and Linton sat for some time in the oak parlour of the \"Blue  Boar\". It was late when they went out. As they reached the water's edge  Linton uttered a cry of consternation.    \"What's up?\" asked Dunstable. \"I wish you wouldn't do that so suddenly.  It gives me a start. Do you feel bad?\"    \"Great Scott! it's gone.\"    \"The pain?\"    \"Our boat. I tied it up to this post.\"    \"You can't have done. What's that boat over there! That looks like  ours.\"    \"No, it isn't. That was there when we came. I noticed it. I tied ours  up here, to this post.\"    \"This is a shade awkward,\" said Dunstable thoughtfully. \"You must have  tied it up jolly rottenly. It must have slipped away and gone  down-stream. This is where we find ourselves in the cart. Right among  the ribstons, by Jove. I feel like that Frenchman in the story, who  lost his glasses just as he got to the top of the mountain, and missed  the view. Altogezzer I do not vish I 'ad kom.\"    \"I'm certain I tied it up all right. And--why, look! here's the rope  still on the pole, just as I left it.\"    For the first time Dunstable seemed interested.    \"This is getting mysterious. Did we hire a rowing-boat or a submarine?  There's something on the end of this rope. Give it a tug, and see.  There, didn't you feel it?\"    \"I do believe,\" said Linton in an awed voice, \"the thing's sunk.\"    They pulled at the rope together. The waters heaved and broke, and up  came the nose of the boat, to sink back with a splash as they loosened  their hold.    \"There are more things in Heaven and Earth--\" said Dunstable, wiping  his hands. \"If you ask me, I should say an enemy hath done this. A boat  doesn't sink of its own accord.\"    \"Albert!\" said Linton. \"The blackguard must have followed us up and  done it while we were at tea.\"    \"That's about it,\" said Dunstable. \"And now--how about getting home?\"    \"I suppose we'd better walk. We shall be hours late for lock-up.\"    \"You,\" said Dunstable, \"may walk if you are fond of exercise and aren't  in a hurry. Personally, I'm going back by river.\"    \"But--\"    \"That looks a good enough boat over there. Anyhow, we must make it do.  One mustn't be particular for once.\"    \"But it belongs--what will the other fellow do?\"    \"I can't help _his_ troubles,\" said Dunstable mildly, \"having  enough of my own. Coming?\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was about ten minutes later that Sheen, approaching the waterside in  quest of his boat, found no boat there. The time was a quarter to six,  and lock-up was at six-thirty.          XIII    DEUS EX MACHINA      It did not occur to Sheen immediately that his boat had actually gone.  The full beauty of the situation was some moments in coming home to  him. At first he merely thought that somebody had moved it to another  part of the bank, as the authorities at the inn had done once or twice  in the past, to make room for the boats of fresh visitors. Walking  along the lawn in search of it, he came upon the stake to which  Dunstable's submerged craft was attached. He gave the rope a tentative  pull, and was surprised to find that there was a heavy drag on the end  of it.    Then suddenly the truth flashed across him. \"Heavens!\" he cried, \"it's  sunk.\"    Joe Bevan and other allies lent their aid to the pulling. The lost boat  came out of the river like some huge fish, and finally rested on the  bank,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],[0,"Pictures Every Child Should Know (#13)"],[1,"had won a  prize for which a friend of his had also competed, and upon losing the  prize the last time he tried for it, the friend raised his hands and  prayed for the power to accept his failure with resignation and  humility. Duerer, looking at him, was impressed with the eloquence of  the gesture; thus the \"Praying Hands\" was conceived.    Duerer was also called the _Father of Picture Books_, because he  designed so many woodcuts that he first made possible the illustration  of stories.    He printed his own illustrations in his own house, and was well paid  for it. The Emperor Maximillian visited Nuremberg, and wishing to  honour Duerer, commanded him to make a triumphal arch.    \"It was not to be fashioned in stone like the arches given to the  victorious Roman Emperors; but instead it was to be composed of  engravings. Duerer made for this purpose ninety-two separate blocks of  woodcuts. On these were represented Maximillian's genealogical tree  and the principal events of his life. All these were arranged in the  form of an arch, 9 feet wide and 10-1/2 feet high. It took Duerer three  years to do this work, and he was never well paid,\" so says one who  has compiled many incidents of his life.    \"While the artist worked, the Emperor often visited his studio; and as  Duerer's pet cats often visited it at the same time, the expression  arose, 'a cat may look at a King!'\"    On the occasion of one of these kingly visits, Maximillian tried to do  a little art-work on his own account. Taking a piece of charcoal he  tried to sketch, but the charcoal kept breaking and he asked Duerer why  it did so.    \"That is my sceptre; your Majesty has other and greater work to do,\"  was the tactful reply. It is a question with us to-day whether the  King ever did a greater work than Albrecht Duerer, king of painters,  was doing.    After this, Maximillian gave Duerer a pension, but when the Emperor  died the artist found it necessary to apply to the monarch who came  after him, in order to have the gift confirmed. This was the occasion  for his journey to the Low Countries, and he took his wife Agnes with  him. In the Netherlands he was received with much honour and was  invited to become court painter; and what was more, his pension was  fixed upon him for life. The great work of his life was his  illustration of the Apocalypse. For this he made sixteen extraordinary  woodcuts, of great size.    On his journey to see Charles V., Maximillian's successor, Duerer kept  a diary in which he noted the minutest details of all that happened to  him. He told of the coronation of Charles; of hearing about a whale  that had been cast upon the shore; of his disappointment that it had  been removed before he had reached the place. He wrote with great  indignation about the supposed kidnapping of Martin Luther, while he  was on his way home from the Diet of Worms.    While Duerer was in the Low Countries, a fever came upon him, and when  he returned home, it still followed him. Indeed, although he lived for  seven years after his return, he was never well again. Among his  effects there was a sketch made to indicate to his physician the seat  of his illness.    Duerer did not paint great frescoes upon walls as did Raphael, Michael  Angelo, and all great Italian artists; but instead he painted on wood,  canvas, and in oils.    In all the civilised world Duerer was honoured equally with the great  Italian painters of his time. He was a man of much conscientiousness,  dignity, and tenderness. He was devoted to his home and country, and  regarded the problems of life intellectually. When he came to die, his  end was so unexpected that those dearest to him could not reach his  bedside. He was buried in St. John's cemetery in Nuremberg. After his  death, Martin Luther wrote as follows to their mutual friend, Eoban  Hesse:    \"As for Duerer; assuredly affection bids us mourn for one who was the  best of men, yet you may well hold him happy that he has made so good  an end, and that Christ has taken him from the midst of this time of  troubles, and from yet greater troubles in store, lest he, that  deserved to behold nothing but the best, should be compelled to behold  the worst. Therefore may he rest in peace with his fathers, Amen.\"      PLATE--THE NATIVITY    Our description of this painting calls attention to the fact that the  columns and arches of the picturesque ruin belong to a much later  period in history than the birth of Christ. Duerer was not acquainted  with any earlier style of architecture than the Romanesque and  therefore he used it here. \"The ruin serves as a stable. A roof of  board is built out in front of the side-room which shelters the ox and  ass, and under this lean-to lies the new born babe surrounded by  angels who express their childish joy. Mary kneels and contemplates  her child with glad emotion. Joseph, also deeply moved, kneels down on  the other side of the child, outside the shelter of the roof. Some  shepherds to whom the angel, who is still seen hovering in the air,  has announced the tidings, are already entering from without the  walls.\" (Knackfuss). The picture is the central panel of an  altar-piece now in the Old Pinakothek at Munich. Duerer's oil painting  of the four apostles--John, Peter, Mark, and Paul--is in the same  gallery. Other Duerer pictures are: \"The Knight, Death and the Devil,\"  \"The Adoration of the Magi,\" \"Melancholy,\" and portraits of himself.          XIV    MARIANO FORTUNY        (Pronounced Mah-ree-ah-no' For-tu'ne)    _Spanish School_    1838-1874    _Pupil of Claudio Lorenzalez_    Fortuny won his own opportunities. He took a prize, while still very  young, which made it possible for him to go to Rome where he wished to  study art. He did not spend his time studying and copying the old  masters as did most artists who went there, but, instead, he studied  the life of the Roman streets.    He had already been at the Academy of Barcelona, but he did not follow  his first master; instead, he struck out a line of art for  himself. After a year in Rome the artist went to war; but he did not  go to fight men, he was still fighting fate, and his weapon was his  sketch book. He went with General Prim, and he filled his book with  warlike scenes and the brilliant skies of Morocco. From that time his  work was inspired by his Moorish experiences.    After going to war without becoming a soldier, Fortuny returned to  Paris and there he became fast friends with Meissonier, so that a good  deal of his work was influenced by that artist's genius. After a time  Fortuny's paintings came into great vogue and far-off Americans began  buying them, as well as Europeans. There was a certain rich dry-goods  merchant in the United States who had made a large fortune for those  days, and while he knew nothing about art, he wanted to spend his  money for fine things. So he employed people who did understand the  matter to buy for him many pictures whose excellence he, himself,  could not understand, but which were to become a fine possession for  succeeding generations. This was about 1860, and this man,  A.T. Stewart, bought two of Fortuny's pictures at high prices. \"The  Serpent Charmer,\" and \"A Fantasy of Morocco.\"    When Fortuny was thirty years old he married the daughter of a  Spaniard called Madrazo, director of the Royal Museum. His wife's  family had several well known artists in it, and the marriage was a  very happy one. Because of this, Fortuny was inspired to paint one of  the greatest of his pictures, \"The Spanish Marriage.\" In it are to be  seen the portraits of his wife and his friend Regnault. After a time  he went to live in Granada; but he could never forget the beautiful,  barbaric scenes in Morocco, and so he returned there. Afterward he  went with his wife to live in Rome, and there they had a fine home and  everything exquisite about them, while fortune and favour showered  upon them; but he fell ill with Roman fever, because of working in the  open air, and he died while he was comparatively a young man.      PLATE--THE SPANISH MARRIAGE    Fortuny is said to \"split the light into a thousand particles, till  his pictures sparkle like jewels and are as brilliant as a  kaleidoscope.... He set the fashion for a class of pictures, filled  with silks and satins, bric-a-brac and elegant trifling.\"    Look at the brilliant scene in this picture! The priest rising from  his chair and leaning over the table is watching the bridegroom sign  his name. This chap is an old fop, bedecked in lilac satin, while the  bride is a dainty young woman, without much interest in her husband,  for she is fingering her beautiful fan and gossiping with one of her  girl friends. She wears orange-blossoms in her black hair and is in  full bridal array. One couple, two men, sit on an elegantly carved  seat and are looking at the goings-on with amusement, while an old  gentleman sits quite apart, disgusted with the whole unimpressive  scene. Everybody is trifling, and no one is serious for the  occasion. The furnishings of the room are beautiful, delicate, almost  frivolous. People are strewn about like flowers, and the whole effect  is airy and inconsequent. Fortuny painted also \"The Praying Arab,\" \"A  Fantasy of Morocco,\" \"Snake Charmers,\" \"Camels at Rest,\" etc.          XV    THOMAS GAINSBOROUGH        _English School_    1727-1788    _Pupil of Gravelot and of Hayman_    There seems to have been no artist, with the extraordinary exceptions  of Duerer and Leonardo, who learned his lessons while at school. Little  painters have uniformly begun as bad spellers.    Gainsborough's father was in the business of woolen-crape making,  while his mother painted flowers, very nicely, and it was she who  taught the small Thomas. There were nine little Gainsboroughs and,  shocking to relate, the artist of the family was so ready with his  pencil that when he was ten years old he forged his father's name to a"]]]
