[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#13)"],[1," was fully repaid; Justine was  the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she  made any professions; I never heard one pass her lips; but you could see  by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her  disposition was gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid  the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the  model of all excellence, and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and  manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.    \"When my dearest aunt died, every one was too much occupied in their own  grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness  with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other  trials were reserved for her.    \"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the  exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience  of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her  favourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality. She  was a Roman catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea  which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure  for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor  girl! she wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since  the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to  her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her  residence at her mother's house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The  poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged  Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of  having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting  at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased  her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever. She died on the  first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter.  Justine has returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is  very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her  mien and her expressions continually remind me of my dear aunt.    \"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling  William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with  sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he  smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with  health. He has already had one or two little _wives_, but Louisa Biron  is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.    \"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip  concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has  already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage  with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon,  married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite  schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the  departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already recovered his  spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively  pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older  than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with  everybody.    \"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety  returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,--one line--one  word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his  kindness, his affection, and his many letters: we are sincerely  grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you,  write!    \"ELIZABETH LAVENZA.    \"Geneva, March 18th, 17--.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Dear, dear Elizabeth!\" I exclaimed, when I had read her letter, \"I will  write instantly, and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.\" I  wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had  commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another fortnight I was able to  leave my chamber.    One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the  several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind  of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.  Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of  my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of  natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the  sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous  symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.  He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a  dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these  cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M.  Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the  astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that  I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed  my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to  the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me  out. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as  if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments  which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel  death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.  Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the  sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his  total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I  thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that  he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and  although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew  no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide to him that  event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared  the detail to another would only impress more deeply.    M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of  almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me  even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. \"D--n the  fellow!\" cried he; \"why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us  all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster  who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in  the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he  is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.--Ay, ay,\"  continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, \"M.  Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men  should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself  when young; but that wears out in a very short time.\"    M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned  the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.    Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his  literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He  came to the university with the design of making himself complete master  of the oriental languages, as thus he should open a field for the plan  of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious  career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his  spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanscrit languages  engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same  studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to  fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in  being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction  but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like him,  attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not  contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I  read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my  labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a  degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.  When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and  a garden of roses,--in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the  fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and  heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!    Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was  fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several  accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,  and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay  very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved  friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness  to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted  with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully;  and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty  compensated for its dilatoriness.    The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily  which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a  pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a  personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with  pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had  always been my favourite companion in the rambles of this nature that I  had taken among the scenes of my native country.    We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had  long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the  salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and  the conversation of my friend. Study had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4248"],[0,"The Problem of the Ohio Mounds (#13)"],[1," of the State are due to the Delawares  and Shawnees, chiefly the former, who continued to bury in  sepulchers of this type after their return from the East. Those in  Ashland and some other counties, as is well known, mark the  location of villages of this tribe. Those along the Ohio, which  are chiefly sporadic, are probably Shawnee burial places, and  older than those of the Delawares. The bands of the Shawnees which  settled in the Scioto Valley appear to have abandoned this method  of burial.    There are certain mounds consisting entirely or in part of stone,  and also stone graves or vaults of a peculiar type, found in the  extreme southern portions of the State and in the northern part of  Kentucky, which can not be connected with any other works, and  probably owe their origin to a people who either became extinct or  merged into some other tribe so far back that no tradition of them  now remains.    Recently a resurvey of the remaining circular, square, and  octagonal works of Ohio has been made by the Bureau agents. The  result will be given in a future bulletin."]]]
