But the second practice is a combination of perspective derived  partly from art and partly from nature and the work done by its  rules is in every portion of it, influenced by natural perspective  and artificial perspective. By natural perspective I mean that the  plane on which this perspective is represented is a flat surface,  and this plane, although it is parallel both in length and height,  is forced to diminish in its remoter parts more than in its nearer  ones. And this is proved by the first of what has been said above,  and its diminution is natural. But artificial perspective, that is  that which is devised by art, does the contrary; for objects equal  in size increase on the plane where it is foreshortened in  proportion as the eye is more natural and nearer to the plane, and  as the part of the plane on which it is figured is farther from the  eye.    And let this plane be _d e_ on which are seen 3 equal circles which  are beyond this plane _d e_, that is the circles _a b c_. Now you  see that the eye _h_ sees on the vertical plane the sections of the  images, largest of those that are farthest and smallest of the  nearest.    108.    Here follows what is wanting in the margin at the foot on the other  side of this page.    Natural perspective acts in a contrary way; for, at greater  distances the object seen appears smaller, and at a smaller distance  the object appears larger. But this said invention requires the  spectator to stand with his eye at a small hole and then, at that  small hole, it will be very plain. But since many (men's) eyes  endeavour at the same time to see one and the same picture produced  by this artifice only one can see clearly the effect of this  perspective and all the others will see confusion. It is well  therefore to avoid such complex perspective and hold to simple  perspective which does not regard planes as foreshortened, but as  much as possible in their proper form. This simple perspective, in  which the plane intersects the pyramids by which the images are  conveyed to the eye at an equal distance from the eye is our  constant experience, from the curved form of the pupil of the eye on  which the pyramids are intersected at an equal distance from the  visual virtue.    [Footnote 24: _la prima di sopra_ i. e. the first of the three  diagrams which, in the original MS., are placed in the margin at the  beginning of this chapter.]    109.    OF A MIXTURE OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL PERSPECTIVE.    This diagram distinguishes natural from artificial perspective. But  before proceeding any farther I will define what is natural and what  is artificial perspective. Natural perspective says that the more  remote of a series of objects of equal size will look the smaller,  and conversely, the nearer will look the larger and the apparent  size will diminish in proportion to the distance. But in artificial  perspective when objects of unequal size are placed at various  distances, the smallest is nearer to the eye than the largest and  the greatest distance looks as though it were the least of all; and  the cause of this is the plane on which the objects are represented;  and which is at unequal distances from the eye throughout its  length. And this diminution of the plane is natural, but the  perspective shown upon it is artificial since it nowhere agrees with  the true diminution of the said plane. Whence it follows, that when  the eye is somewhat removed from the [station point of the]  perspective that it has been gazing at, all the objects represented  look monstrous, and this does not occur in natural perspective,  which has been defined above. Let us say then, that the square _a b  c d_ figured above is foreshortened being seen by the eye situated  in the centre of the side which is in front. But a mixture of  artificial and natural perspective will be seen in this tetragon  called _el main_ [Footnote 20: _el main_ is quite legibly written in  the original; the meaning and derivation of the word are equally  doubtful.], that is to say _e f g h_ which must appear to the eye of  the spectator to be equal to _a b c d_ so long as the eye remains in  its first position between _c_ and _d_. And this will be seen to  have a good effect, because the natural perspective of the plane  will conceal the defects which would [otherwise] seem monstrous.    _III._    _Six books on Light and Shade._    _Linear Perspective cannot be immediately followed by either the_  \"prospettiva de' perdimenti\" _or the_ \"prospettiva de' colori\" _or  the aerial perspective; since these branches of the subject  presuppose a knowledge of the principles of Light and Shade. No  apology, therefore, is here needed for placing these immediately  after Linear Perspective._    _We have various plans suggested by Leonardo for the arrangement of  the mass of materials treating of this subject. Among these I have  given the preference to a scheme propounded in No._ III, _because,  in all probability, we have here a final and definite purpose  expressed. Several authors have expressed it as their opinion that  the Paris Manuscript_ C _is a complete and finished treatise on  Light and Shade. Certainly, the Principles of Light and Shade form  by far the larger portion of this MS. which consists of two separate  parts; still, the materials are far from being finally arranged. It  is also evident that he here investigates the subject from the point  of view of the Physicist rather than from that of the Painter._    _The plan of a scheme of arrangement suggested in No._ III _and  adopted by me has been strictly adhered to for the first four Books.  For the three last, however, few materials have come down to us; and  it must be admitted that these three Books would find a far more  appropriate place in a work on Physics than in a treatise on  Painting. For this reason I have collected in Book V all the  chapters on Reflections, and in Book VI I have put together and  arranged all the sections of MS._ C _that belong to the book on  Painting, so far as they relate to Light and Shade, while the  sections of the same MS. which treat of the_ \"Prospettiva de'  perdimenti\" _have, of course, been excluded from the series on Light  and Shade._    [Footnote III: This text has already been published with some slight  variations in Dozio's pamphlet _Degli scritti e disegni di Leonardo  da Vinci_, Milan 1871, pp. 30--31.

Prolegomena.    110.    You must first explain the theory and then the practice. First you  must describe the shadows and lights on opaque objects, and then on  transparent bodies.    Scheme of the books on Light and shade.    111.    INTRODUCTION.    [Having already treated of the nature of shadows and the way in  which they are cast [Footnote 2: _Avendo io tractato._--We may  suppose that he here refers to some particular MS., possibly Paris  C.], I will now consider the places on which they fall; and their  curvature, obliquity, flatness or, in short, any character I may be  able to detect in them.]    Shadow is the obstruction of light. Shadows appear to me to be of  supreme importance in perspective, because, without them opaque and  solid bodies will be ill defined; that which is contained within  their outlines and their boundaries themselves will be  ill-understood unless they are shown against a background of a  different tone from themselves. And therefore in my first  proposition concerning shadow I state that every opaque body is  surrounded and its whole surface enveloped in shadow and light. And  on this proposition I build up the first Book. Besides this, shadows  have in themselves various degrees of darkness, because they are  caused by the absence of a variable amount of the luminous rays; and  these I call Primary shadows because they are the first, and  inseparable from the object to which they belong. And on this I will  found my second Book. From these primary shadows there result  certain shaded rays which are diffused through the atmosphere and  these vary in character according to that of the primary shadows  whence they are derived. I shall therefore call these shadows  Derived shadows because they are produced by other shadows; and the  third Book will treat of these. Again these derived shadows, where  they are intercepted by various objects, produce effects as various  as the places where they are cast and of this I will treat in the  fourth Book. And since all round the derived shadows, where the  derived shadows are intercepted, there is always a space where the  light falls and by reflected dispersion is thrown back towards its  cause, it meets the original shadow and mingles with it and modifies  it somewhat in its nature; and on this I will compose my fifth Book.  Besides this, in the sixth Book I will investigate the many and  various diversities of reflections resulting from these rays which  will modify the original [shadow] by [imparting] some of the various  colours from the different objects whence these reflected rays are  derived. Again, the seventh Book will treat of the various distances  that may exist between the spot where the reflected rays fall and  that where they originate, and the various shades of colour which  they will acquire in falling on opaque bodies.    Different principles and plans of treatment (112--116).    112.    First I will treat of light falling through windows which I will  call Restricted [Light] and then I will treat of light in the open  country, to which I will give the name of diffused Light. Then I  will treat of the light of luminous bodies.    113.    OF PAINTING.    The conditions of shadow and light [as seen] by the eye are 3.

If Nell happens around don't--don't flatter  her, Laddy, like you did at dinner.  Don't make her think of her looks.\"    Dick heard Mrs. Belding walk away.    \"Shore she's powerful particular about that girl,\" observed Laddy.  \"Say, Tom, Nell knows she's pretty, doesn't she?\"    \"She's liable to find it out unless you shut up, Laddy.  When you  visited us out here some weeks ago, you kept paying cowboy compliments  to her.\"    \"An' it's your idea that cowboy compliments are plumb bad for girls?\"    \"Downright bad, Laddy, so my wife says.\"    \"I'll be darned if I believe any girl can be hurt by a little sweet  talk.  It pleases 'em.... But say, Beldin', speaking of looks, have you  got a peek yet at the Spanish girl?\"    \"Not in the light.\"    \"Well, neither have I in daytime.  I had enough by moonlight. Nell is  some on looks, but I'm regretful passin' the ribbon to the lady from  Mex.  Jim, where are you?\"    \"My money's on Nell,\" replied Lash.  \"Gimme a girl with flesh an'  color, an' blue eyes a-laughin'.  Miss Castaneda is some peach, I'll  not gainsay.  But her face seemed too white.  An' when she flashed  those eyes on me, I thought I was shot!  When she stood up there at  first, thankin' us, I felt as if a--a princess was round somewhere.  Now, Nell is kiddish an' sweet an'--\"    \"Chop it,\" interrupted Belding.  \"Here comes Nell now.\"    Dick's tingling ears took in the pattering of light footsteps, the rush  of some one running.    \"Here you are,\" cried a sweet, happy voice.  \"Dad, the Senorita is  perfectly lovely.  I've been peeping at her.  She sleeps like--like  death.  She's so white.  Oh, I hope she won't be ill.\"    \"Shore she's only played out,\" said Laddy.  \"But she had spunk while it  lasted.... I was just arguin' with Jim an' Tom about Miss Castaneda.\"    \"Gracious!  Why, she's beautiful.  I never saw any one so beautiful....  How strange and sad, that about her!  Tell me more, Laddy.  You  promised.  I'm dying to know.  I never hear anything in this awful  place.  Didn't you say the Senorita had a sweetheart?\"    \"Shore I did.\"    \"And he's a cavalryman?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Is he the young man who came with you?\"    \"Nope.  That fellow's the one who saved the girl from Rojas.\"    \"Ah!  Where is he, Laddy?\"    \"He's in there asleep.\"    \"Is he hurt?\"    \"I reckon not.  He walked about fifteen miles.\"    \"Is he--nice, Laddy?\"    \"Shore.\"    \"What is he like?\"    \"Well, I'm not long acquainted, never saw him by day, but I was some  tolerable took with him.  An' Jim here, Jim says the young man can have  his gun an' his hoss.\"    \"Wonderful!  Laddy, what on earth did this stranger do to win you  cowboys in just one night?\"    \"I'll shore have to tell you.  Me an' Jim were watchin' a game of cards  in the Del Sol saloon in Casita.  That's across the line. We had  acquaintances--four fellows from the Cross Bar outfit, where we worked  a while back.  This Del Sol is a billiard hall, saloon, restaurant, an'  the like.  An' it was full of Greasers. Some of Camp's rebels were  there drinkin' an' playin' games. Then pretty soon in come Rojas with  some of his outfit. They were packin' guns an' kept to themselves off  to one side. I didn't give them a second look till Jim said he reckoned  there was somethin' in the wind.  Then, careless-like, I began to peek  at Rojas.  They call Rojas the 'dandy rebel,' an' he shore looked the  part.  It made me sick to see him in all that lace an' glitter, knowin'  him to be the cutthroat robber he is. It's no oncommon sight to see  excited Greasers.  They're all crazy. But this bandit was shore some  agitated.  He kept his men in a tight bunch round a table.  He talked  an' waved his hands.  He was actually shakin'.  His eyes had a wild  glare.  Now I figgered that trouble was brewin', most likely for the  little Casita garrison. People seemed to think Campo an' Rojas would  join forces to oust the federals.  Jim thought Rojas's excitement was  at the hatchin' of some plot.  Anyway, we didn't join no card games,  an' without pretendin' to, we was some watchful.    \"A little while afterward I seen a fellow standin' in the restaurant  door.  He was a young American dressed in corduroys and boots, like a  prospector.  You know it's no onusual fact to see prospectors in these  parts.  What made me think twice about this one was how big he seemed,  how he filled up that door.  He looked round the saloon, an' when he  spotted Rojas he sorta jerked up.  Then he pulled his slouch hat  lopsided an' began to stagger down, down the steps.  First off I made  shore he was drunk.  But I remembered he didn't seem drunk before.  It  was some queer.  So I watched that young man.    \"He reeled around the room like a fellow who was drunker'n a lord.  Nobody but me seemed to notice him.  Then he began to stumble over  pool-players an' get his feet tangled up in chairs an' bump against  tables. He got some pretty hard looks.  He came round our way, an' all  of a sudden he seen us cowboys.  He gave another start, like the one  when he first seen Rojas, then he made for us.  I tipped Jim off that  somethin' was doin'.    \"When he got close he straightened up, put back his slouch hat, an'  looked at us.  Then I saw his face.  It sorta electrified yours truly.  It was white, with veins standin' out an' eyes flamin'--a face of fury.  I was plumb amazed, didn't know what to think. Then this queer young  man shot some cool, polite words at me an' Jim.    \"He was only bluffin' at bein' drunk--he meant to rush Rojas, to start  a rough house.  The bandit was after a girl.  This girl was in the  hotel, an' she was the sweetheart of a soldier, the young fellow's  friend.  The hotel was watched by Rojas's guards, an' the plan was to  make a fuss an' get the girl away in the excitement. Well, Jim an' me  got a hint of our bein' Americans--that cowboys generally had a name  for loyalty to women.  Then this amazin' chap--you can't imagine how  scornful--said for me an' Jim to watch him.    \"Before I could catch my breath an' figger out what he meant by 'rush'  an' 'rough house' he had knocked over a table an' crowded some Greaser  half off the map.  One little funny man leaped up like a wild monkey  an' began to screech.  An' in another second he was in the air upside  down.  When he lit, he laid there.  Then, quicker'n I can tell you, the  young man dove at Rojas.  Like a mad steer on the rampage he charged  Rojas an' his men.  The whole outfit went down--smash!  I figgered then  what 'rush' meant.  The young fellow came up out of the pile with  Rojas, an' just like I'd sling an empty sack along the floor he sent  the bandit.  But swift as that went he was on top of Rojas before the  chairs an' tables had stopped rollin'.    \"I woke up then, an' made for the center of the room. Jim with me. I  began to shoot out the lamps.  Jim throwed his guns on the crazy  rebels, an' I was afraid there'd be blood spilled before I could get  the room dark.  Bein's shore busy, I lost sight of the young fellow for  a second or so, an' when I got an eye free for him I seen a Greaser  about to knife him.  Think I was some considerate of the Greaser by  only shootin' his arm off.  Then I cracked the last lamp, an' in the  hullabaloo me an' Jim vamoosed.    \"We made tracks for our hosses an' packs, an' was hittin' the San  Felipe road when we run right plumb into the young man.  Well, he said  his name was Gale--Dick Gale.  The girl was with him safe an' well; but  her sweetheart, the soldier, bein' away without leave, had to go back  sudden.  There shore was some trouble, for Jim an' me heard shootin'.  Gale said he had no money, no friends, was a stranger in a desert  country; an' he was distracted to know how to help the girl.  So me an'  Jim started off with them for San Felipe, got switched, and' then we  headed for the Rio Forlorn.\"    \"Oh, I think he was perfectly splendid!\" exclaimed the girl.    \"Shore he was.  Only, Nell, you can't lay no claim to bein' the  original discoverer of that fact.\"    \"But, Laddy, you haven't told me what he looks like.\"    At this juncture Dick Gale felt it absolutely impossible for him to  play the eavesdropper any longer.  Quietly he rolled out of bed. The  voices still sounded close outside, and it was only by effort that he  kept from further listening.  Belding's kindly interest, Laddy's blunt  and sincere cowboy eulogy, the girl's sweet eagerness and praise--these  warmed Gale's heart.  He had fallen among simple people, into whose  lives the advent of an unknown man was welcome. He found himself in a  singularly agitated mood.  The excitement, the thrill, the difference  felt in himself, experienced the preceding night, had extended on into  his present.  And the possibilities suggested by the conversation he  had unwittingly overheard added sufficiently to the other feelings to  put him into a peculiarly receptive state of mind.  He was wild to be  one of the Belding rangers.  The idea of riding a horse in the open  desert, with a dangerous duty to perform, seemed to strike him with an  appealing force.  Something within him went out to the cowboys, to this  blunt and kind Belding. He was afraid to meet the girl.  If every man  who came along fell in love with this sweet-voiced Nell, then what hope  had he to escape--now, when his whole inner awakening betokened a  change of spirit, hope, a finding of real worth, real good, real power  in himself?  He did not understand wholly, yet he felt ready to ride,  to fight, to love the desert, to love these outdoor men, to love a  woman.  That beautiful Spanish girl had spoken to something dead in him  and it had quickened to life.  The sweet voice of an audacious, unseen  girl warned him that presently a still more wonderful thing would  happen to him.    Gale imagined he made noise enough as he clumsily pulled on his boots,  yet the voices, split by a merry laugh, kept on murmuring outside the  door.  It"]]]
