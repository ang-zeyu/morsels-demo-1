[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39674"],[0,"Buffalo Land (#13)"],[1,"almost immediately by its round face, for all the world like a  jolly old jack tar, with his broad brim coming above deck. It reminded  me on the instant of our brackish friend, Captain Walrus; and in  imagination I dreamily pictured, as coming after him, with the  broadening daylight, a troop of Alaskans, their sleds laden with  blubber.    The air was singularly clear and bracing, producing an effect upon a  pair of healthy lungs like that felt on first reaching the sea-beach  from a residence inland. An illusion which had followed many of us from  boyhood was utterly dissipated by the early dawn in this strange land.  This was not the fact that the \"great American desert\" of our  school-days is not a desert at all, for this we had known for years; it  related to those floods of flame and stifling smoke with which  sensational writers of western novels are wont to sweep, as with a besom  of destruction, the whole of prairie-land once at least in every story.  Young America, wasting uncounted gallons of midnight oil in the perusal  of peppery tales of border life, little suspects how slight the  foundation upon which his favorite author has reared the whole vast  superstructure of thrilling adventure.    The scene of these heart-rending narratives is usually laid in a  boundless plain covered with tall grass, and the _dramatis personae_ are  an indefinite number of buffalo and Indians, a painfully definite one of  emigrants, two persons unhappy enough to possess a beautiful daughter,  and a lover still more unhappy in endeavoring to acquire title, a  rascally half-breed burning to prevent the latter feat, and a rare old  plainsman specially brought into existence to \"sarcumvent\" him.    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION. BUFFALO_    FIRE ON THE PLAINS, ACCORDING TO NOVELS.]    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION_    FIRE ON THE PLAINS, AS IT IS.]    At the most critical juncture the \"waving sea of grass\" usually takes  fire, in an unaccountable manner--perhaps from the hot condition of the  combatants, or the quantities of burning love and revenge which are  recklessly scattered about. Multitudes of frightened buffalo and gay  gazelles make the ground shake in getting out of the way, and the flames  go to licking the clouds, while the emigrants go to licking the  Indians. Although the fire can not be put out, one or the other, or  possibly both, of the combatants are \"put out\" in short order.  Should the miserable parents succeed in getting their daughter safely  through this peril, it is only because she is reserved for a further  laceration of our feelings. The half-breed soon gets her, and the lover  and rare old plainsman get on his track immediately afterward. And so on  _ad libitum_.    We beg pardon for condensing into our sunrise reflections the material  for a novel, such as has often run well through three hundred pages, and  furnished with competencies half as many bill-posters. It is unpleasant  to have one's traditionary heroes and heroines all knocked into pi  before breakfast. It makes one crusty. Possibly, it may be their proper  desert, but, if so, could be better digested after dinner.    The whole story would fail if the fire did, as novelists never like to  have their heroines left out in the cold. But it is as impossible for  flames as it is for human beings to exist on air alone. It is scarcely  less so for them to feed, as they are supposed to do, on such scanty  grass. The truth is, that what the bison, with his close-cropping teeth,  is enabled to grow fat on, makes but poor material for a first-class  conflagration.    The grass which covers the great plains of the Far West is more like  brown moss than what its name implies. Perhaps as good an idea of it as  is possible to any one who has never seen it, may be obtained by  imagining a great buffalo robe covering the ground. The hair would be  about the color and nearly the length of the grass, at the season in  question. In the spring the plains are fresh and green, but the grass  cures rapidly on the stalk, and before the end of July is brown and  ripe. It will then burn readily, but the fire is like that eating along  a carpet, and by no means terrifying to either man or brute. The only  occasion when it could possibly prove dangerous is when it reaches, as  it sometimes does, some of the narrow valleys where the tall grass of  the bottom grows; but even then, a run of a hundred yards will take one  to buffalo grass and safety. This latter fact we learned from actual  experience, later on our trip.    What a wild land we were in! A few puffs of a locomotive had transferred  us from civilization to solitude itself. This was the \"great American  desert\" which so caught our boyish eyes, in the days of our school  geography and the long ago. A mysterious land with its wonderful record  of savages and scouts, battles and hunts. We had a vague idea then that  a sphynx and half a score of pyramids were located somewhere upon it,  the sand covering its whole surface, when not engaged in some sort of  simoon performance above. No trains of camels, with wonderful patience  and marvelous internal reservoirs of water, dragged their weary way  along, it was true; yet that animal's first cousin, the American mule,  was there in numbers, as hardy and as useful as the other. Many an  eastern mother, in the days of the gold fever, took down her boys  discarded atlas, and finding the space on the continent marked \"Great  American Desert,\" followed with tearful eyes the course of the emigrant  trains, and tried to fix the spot where the dear bones of her first-born  lay bleaching.    As a people, we are better acquainted with the wastes of Egypt than with  some parts of our own land. The plains have been considered the abode of  hunger, thirst, and violence, and most of our party expected to meet  these geniuses on the threshold of their domain, and, while Shamus  should fight the first two with his skillet and camp-kettles to war  against the third with rifle and hunting-knife.    But in the scene around us there was nothing terrifying in the least  degree. The sun had risen with a clear highway before him, and no clouds  to entangle his chariot wheels. He was mellow at this early hour, and  scattered down his light and warmth liberally. Wherever the soil was  turned up by the track, we discovered it to be strong and deep, and  capable of producing abundant crops of resin weeds and sunflowers, which  with farmers is a written certificate, in the \"language of flowers,\" of  good character.    We thundered through many thriving cities of prairie dogs, the  inhabitants of which seemed all out of doors, and engaged in  tail-bearing from house to house. The principal occupations of this  animal appears to be two; first, barking like a squirrel, and second,  jerking the caudal appendage, which operations synchronize with  remarkable exactitude. One single cord seems to operate both extremities  of the little body at once. It could no more open its mouth without  twitching its tail, than a single-thread Jack could bow its head without  lifting its legs. Those nearest would look pertly at us for a moment,  and then dive head foremost into their holes. The tail would hardly  disappear before the head would take its place and, peering out,  scrutinize us with twinkling eyes, and chatter away in concert with its  neighbors, with an effect which reminded me of a forest of monkeys  suddenly disturbed.    Sachem declared that they must all be females, for no sooner had one  been frightened into the house than it poked its head out again to see  what was the matter. \"That sex would risk life at any time to know what  was up.\"    The professor, with a more practical turn, told us some of the quaint  little animal's habits. \"Why it is called a dog,\" said he, \"I do not  know. Neither in bark, form, or life, is there any resemblance. It is  carnivorous, herbivorous, and abstemious from water, requiring no other  fluids than those obtained by eating roots. Its villages are often far  removed from water, and when tamed it never seems to desire the latter,  though it may acquire a taste for milk. It partakes of meats and  vegetables with apparently equal relish. It is easily captured by  pouring two or three buckets of water down the hole, when it emerges  looking somewhat like a half-drowned rat. The prairie dog is the head of  the original 'happy family.' It was formerly affirmed, even in works of  natural history, that a miniature evidence of the millennium existed in  the home of this little animal. There the rattlesnake, the owl, and the  dog were supposed to lie down together, and such is still the general  belief. It was known that the bird and the reptile lived in these  villages with the dog, and science set them down as honored guests,  instead of robbers and murderers, as they really are.\"    On our trip we frequently killed snakes in these villages which were  distended with dogs recently swallowed. The owls feed on the younger  members of the household, and the old dogs, except when lingering for  love of their young, are not long in abandoning a habitation when snakes  and owls take possession of it. The latter having two votes, and the  owner but one (female suffrage not being acknowledged among the brutes),  it is a \"happy family,\" on democratic principles of the strictest sort.    We have also repeatedly noticed the dogs busily engaged in filling up a  hole quite to the mouth with dirt, and have been led to believe that in  this manner they occasionally revenge themselves upon their enemies,  perhaps when the latter are gorged with tender puppies, by burying them  alive. An old scout once told us that this filling up process occurred  whenever one of their community was dead in his house, but as the  statement was only conjectural, we prefer the other theory.    While we were this day steaming through one village an incident occurred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39685"],[0,"Nooks and Corners of Old England (#13)"],[1,"birthplace of the witty author of _Hudibras_.  It is a peaceful little place, with a few thatched cottages, a fine old  church near the winding river, embosomed in trees. The church is  remarkable for its fine rood-loft with painted panels of saints, which  at some time has been made into a gallery at the west end, and we hope  may be replaced one of these days.    Following the river Avon to Evesham and Stratford-on-Avon, there are  many charming old-world villages rich in timber and thatched cottages.  Such a village is Offenham above Evesham. The village street leads  nowhere, and at the end of it stands a tapering Maypole, as much as to  say, \"Go on with your modern improvement elsewhere if you like, but here  I intend to stay\"; and we believe it is duly decorated and danced around  in the proper fashion, though the inhabitants by the \"new style\" of the  calendar can scarcely dispense with overcoats. We will not follow the  course of the river so far as \"drunken Bidford\" (where the immortal bard  and some convivial friends are said to have been overcome by the effects  of the strong ale at the \"Falcon\"), but turn our steps southwards to  Broadway, which of recent years has had an invasion from America. But  the great broad street of substantial Tudor and Jacobean houses deserves  all the praise that has been lavished upon it. We were there before it  had particularly attracted Jonathan's eye, and after a fortnight's fare  of bread and cheese and eggs and bacon (the usual fare of a walking  tour), we alighted upon a princely pigeon pie at the \"Lygon Arms.\" Under  such circumstances one naturally grows enthusiastic; but even if the  fine old hostelry had offered as cold a reception as that at Stilton, we  could not but help feeling kindly disposed towards so stately a roadside  inn. Like the \"Bell\" at Stilton, it is stone-built, with mullioned  windows and pointed gables; but here there is a fine carved doorway,  which gives it an air of grandeur. There are roomy corridors within,  leading by stout oak doors to roomier apartments, some oak panelled, and  others with moulded ceilings and carved stone fireplaces. One of these  is known as \"Cromwell's room,\" and one ought to be called \"Charles'  room\" also, for during the Civil Wars the martyr king slept there on  more than one occasion. The wide oak staircase with its deep set window  on the first landing, reminds one of the staircase leading out of the  great hall of Haddon. There is a little wicket gate to keep the dogs  below. Farther up the village street stands Tudor House, which with its  ball-surmounted gable ends and bay-window with heraldic shields above,  bears a cloak-and-rapier look about it; but it was built, according to  the date upon it, when the old Cavalier was poor and soured, and had  sheathed his sword, but nevertheless was counting the months when the  king should come to his own again. The house was empty, and presumably  had been shut up for years. Referring to some notes, we find the  following memoranda by the friend who was with us upon the occasion of  our visit. \"We could obtain no information as to the ownership, or still  more important, the holder of the keys. One old man, who might have  remembered it being built but was slightly hazy on the subject, said no  one ever went inside. Other inquiries in the village led only to intense  astonishment at our desire. And the whole concluded in a large  contingent of the inhabitants standing speechless, marvelling before the  house itself; in which position we left them and it.\"    The old church of Edward IV.'s time is now, or was, deserted in favour  of an early-Victorian one much out of keeping with the village, or  rather town that it once was.    Another decayed town, once of more importance still, is Chipping  Campden, four miles to the north-east of Broadway, in a corner of  Gloucestershire. Here again we have the great wide street with a  profusion of grey stone gables on either side, and projecting inn signs,  and sundials in profusion. At one extremity a noble elm tree and at the  other a huge chestnut, stand like sentinels over the ancient buildings  that they may not share the fate of the neighbouring manor-house, which  was burned down by its loyal owner, the third Viscount Campden, during  the Civil War, to save it from the ignoble fate of being seized and  garrisoned for the Parliamentarians. From the imposing entrance gate and  two remaining curious pavilions at either end of a long terrace, one may  judge it must have been a fine early-Jacobean mansion. Strange that  Campden House, their ancient town residence, should have perished in the  flames also, but over two centuries afterwards. Near the entrance gate  are the almshouses, a very picturesque line of pointed gables and lofty  chimneys. Above them rises the graceful early-Perpendicular church  tower, which in design and proportions is worthy of a cathedral. But the  quaint Jacobean pillared market-house, the Court-house with its handsome  panelled buttresses, and a house of the time of Richard III. with  two-storied bay-window, and an ancient hall, are among the most  interesting buildings in the town. One of the many sign-boards displays  a poetic effusion by a Campden chimney-sweep, a modernised version of  the original which ran as follows:      \"John Hunter Campden doe live here,    Sweeps chimbleys clean and not too deare.    And if your chimbley be a-fire,    He'll put it out if you desire.\"    The \"Red Lion\" is a typical hostelry of the Stuart days, and a  contemporary house opposite, bearing the date 1656, is well worth  notice: the \"Green Dragon\" also, dated 1690.    The interior of the church is disappointing; its new benches, windows,  roof, and chancel giving it a modern look; but there are some fine old  monuments to the ancient lords of the manor, especially that of the  first Viscount Campden and his countess, and there are some fine  fifteenth-century brasses in the chancel.    [Illustration: STANTON.]    Norton House, to the north of the town, near Dover Hill (famous for the  Cotswold games in \"the good old days\"), is a picturesque, many-gabled  house; and at Mickleton, to the north-east, there are some curious old  buildings. Farther north are the remains of Long Marston manor-house,  still containing the roasting-jack which Charles II. as pseudo  scullery-man omitted to wind up, and brought the wrath of the cook upon  his head, much as King Arthur did when he burnt the cakes. But our way  lies southwards through Broadway to Buckland, Stanton, and a place that  should be sylvan according to its name--Stanway-in-the-Woods. Buckland  church and rectory are both of interest. The former has a fine  Perpendicular tower with some grotesque gargoyle demons at the corners.  The benches are good, and a window dated 1585 retains some ancient  painted glass, as the roof does its old colouring, in which the Yorkist  rose is conspicuous. The hall of the rectory has a fine open-timber roof  with central arch richly carved, and upon a window is depicted a rebus  representing one William Grafton, rector of Buckland from 1450 to 1506.  The manor-house also once possessed a hall with lofty timber-framed roof  and huge fireplace of the fourteenth century; but, sad to relate, it was  destroyed when the house was modernised some years ago, but there still  remains a pretty old staircase of a later date.    Farther south the country becomes more wooded and hilly. The high ground  rises on the left above Stanton, and at the foot of the hill near the  village nestle the pretty old church and gabled manor-house, with its  complement of old farm buildings adjacent. The village street, like  Broadway, consists of rows of grey stone gables, at the end of which  stands the sundial-surmounted cross. The interior of the church has not  been spoiled; the carved oak canopied pulpit towering above the ancient  pews is quite in keeping with the old-world village. The Stanways are  about two miles to the south, but there are so few houses that one  wonders where the children come from to attend the village school. Wood  Stanway is not disappointing like many places possessing picturesque  names that we could quote, for it is enveloped in trees, and so is  Church Stanway for that matter.    [Illustration: STANWAY HOUSE.]    [Illustration: STANWAY HOUSE.]    Turning a corner of the road one comes suddenly upon a wonderful old  gateway with fantastic gables and a noble Jacobean doorway. On one side  of it is a high garden wall with great circular holes in it, and over  the wall peep the gables and ornamental perforated parapet of a fine  mansion of Charles I.'s time. This is always a most fascinating picture;  but to see it at its best is when the roses are in bloom, for above the  old wall and through the rounded apertures, the queen of flowers  flourishes in gay festoons as if rejoicing at its surroundings. But if  one is so fortunate as to obtain admission to the gardens then may he or  she rejoice also, for upon the other side of that grey old wall are the  prettiest of gardens and the grandest trees, one of which, an ancient  yew, is no less than twenty-two feet in girth. There are terraces, stone  summer-houses, and nooks and corners such as one only sees in the  grounds of our ancestral homes. Within, the mansion has been much  restored and somewhat modernised, but the great hall and other rooms  take one back to the time of Inigo Jones, who designed the entrance  gateway. In the churchyard close by is buried the most popular local man  of his time, Robert Dover. If he lived in our day he surely would be the  president of the \"Anti-Puritanical League,\" for he it was who made a  successful crusade against the spirit of religious austerity, the  tendency of which was to put down holidays of sport and merry-making. As  a result of his efforts, the hills above Chipping Camden were annually  at Whitsuntide the scene of a revival "]]]
