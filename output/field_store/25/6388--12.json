Look at uddert'ings.  Did  yo'gran'fadder expect to ride at de rate ob sixty miles an hour?  Did he expect to send a telegram to San Francisco in a couple ob  minutes?  Did he eber dream ob talkin' to sumboddy in Chicago froo  a telephone?  Did he knew anyt'ing about electric lights, or  movin' pictures, or carriages wot aint got no bosses, but run wid  gasoline or sumfing like dat?  I tell yo, Massah Tom, we don't  know wot we is comin' to!\"    \"You are quite right, Alexander,\" said Mr. Rover, who had  overheard the talk.  \"Science is making wonderful strides.  Some  day I expect to grow com and wheat, yes, potatoes and other  vegetables, by electricity,\" and then Randolph Rover branched off  into a long discourse on scientific farming that almost took away  poor Aleck's breath.    \"He's a most wonderful man, yo' uncle!\" whispered the colored man  to Sam afterward.  \"Fust t'ing yo' know he'll be growin' corn in  de com crib already shucked!\" and he laughed softly to himself.    On and on over the mighty Atlantic bounded the steamer.  One day  was very much like another, excepting that on Sundays there was a  religious service, which nearly everybody attended. The boys had  become quite attached to Mortimer Blaze and listened eagerly to  the many hunting tales he had to tell.    \"I wish you were going with us,\" said Tom to him.  \"I like your  style, as you Englishman put it.\"    \"Thanks, Rover, and I must say I cotton to you, as the Americans  put it,\" laughed the hunter.  \"Well, perhaps we'll meet in the  interior, who knows?\"    \"Are you going up the Congo?\"    \"I haven't decided yet.  I am hoping to meet some friends at Boma.  Otherwise I may go further down the coast.\"    The steamer bad now struck the equator, and as it was midsummer  the weather was extremely warm, and the smell of the oozing tar,  pouring from every joint, was sickening.  But the weather suited  Alexander Pop perfectly.    \"Dis am jest right,\" he said.  \"I could sleep eall de time,  'ceptin' when de meal gong rings.\"    \"Blood will tell,\" laughed Randolph Rover.  \"When you land,  Alexander, you ought to feel perfectly at home.\"    \"Perhaps, sah; but I dun reckon de United States am good enough  for any man, sah, white or colored.\"    \"Right you are,\" put in Dick.  \"It's the greatest country on the  globe.\"    It was a clear day a week later when the lookout announced land  dead ahead.  It proved to be a point fifteen miles above the mouth  of the Congo, and at once the course was altered to the southward,  and they made the immense mouth of the river before nightfall.    It was a beautiful scene.  Far away dashed the waves against an  immense golden strand, backed up by gigantic forests of tropical  growth and distant mountains veiled in a bluish mist: The river  was so broad that they were scarcely aware that they were entering  its mouth until the captain told them.    When night came the lights of Boma could be distinctly seen,  twinkling silently over the bay of the town.  They dropped anchor  among a score of other vessels; and the long ocean trip became a  thing of the past.    \"I'm all ready to go ashore,\" said Tom.    \"My, but won't it feel good to put foot on land again!\"    \"Indeed it will!\" cried Dick.  \"The ocean is all well enough, but  a fellow doesn't want too much of it.\"    \"And yet I heard one of the French sailors say that he hated the  land,\" put in Sam.  \"He hadn't set foot on shore for three years.  When they reach port he always remains on deck duty until they  leave again.\"    Mortimer Blaze went ashore at once, after bidding all of the party  a hearty good-by.  \"Hope we meet again,\" he said.  \"And, anyway,  good luck to you!\"    \"And good luck to you!\" cried Tom.  \"Hope you bag all of the lions  and tigers you wish,\" and so they parted, not to meet again for  many a day.    It was decided that the Rovers should not leave the ship until  morning.  It can well be imagined that none of the boys slept  soundly that night.  All wondered what was before them, and if  they should succeed or fail in their hunt.    \"Dis aint much ob a town,\" remarked Aleck, as they landed, a  little before noon, in a hot, gentle shower of rain.  \"Nuffin like  New York.\"    \"There is only one New York, as there is but one London,\" answered  Randolph Rover.  \"Our architecture would never do for such a hot  climate.\"    Along the river front was a long line of squatty warehouses,  backed up by narrow and far from clean streets, where the places  of business were huddled together, and where a good share of the  trading was done on the sidewalk.  The population was a very much  mixed one, but of the Europeans the English and French  predominated.  The natives were short, fat, and exceedingly greasy  appearing. Hardly a one of them could speak English.    \"I don't see any Americans,\" remarked Dick.  \"I suppose--\"    \"There is an American store!\" burst out Sam, pointing across the  way.  He had discovered a general trading store, the dilapidated  sign of which read:              SIMON HOOK,           Dealer in Everything.       English Spoken by an American.         Horn of All Kinds Bought.       Yankee Boots Are the Best!    \"He believes in advertising,\" laughed Dick.  \"I'd like to go in  and see Simon Hook.  Perhaps he'll remember something about  father!\" he added suddenly.    \"That's an idea!\" returned Tom.  \"Let us go in, Uncle Randolph.\"    Mr. Rover was willing, and they entered the low and dingy-looking  establishment, which was filled with boxes, barrels, and bags of  goods.    They found the proprietor sitting in an easy chair, his feet on a  desk, and a pipe in his mouth.    \"Is this Mr. Hook?\" asked Randolph Rover.    \"That's me,\" was the answer; but Mr. Hook did not offer to rise,  nor indeed to even shift his position.    \"We saw your sign and as we are Americans we thought we would drop  in,\" went on Mr. Rover.    \"That's right; glad to see you,\" came from the man in the chair;  but still he did not offer to shift his position.    \"Been here many years?\" asked Dick.    \"About twenty.\"    \"How is business?\" put in Tom, bound to say something.    \"Aint none, sonny.\"    \"You don't look very busy.\"    \"It's a fool's place to come to, sonny.  When these goods are sold  I'm going to quit.\"  Mr. Simon Hook paused long enough to take an  extra whiff from his pipe.   \"What brought you here?\"    \"We are on a hunt for a missing man,\" answered Randolph Rover.  \"Did you ever meet him?  His name is Anderson Rover, and he is my  brother.\"    \"Anderson Rover?\" Simon Hook thought for a moment.  \"I remember  him.  He was a gold hunter from Californy, or somethin' like that.\"    \"Yes; he was a mine owner.\"    \"Went up the Congo four or five years ago--maybe longer?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I remember him.  He had lots of money, and took several guides  and a number of other, natives along.\"    \"Have you seen or heard of him since?\" questioned Dick eagerly.    Simon Hook shook his head.  \"No, sonny.  'Twasn't to be expected.\"    \"And why not?\" put in Tom.    \"Because them as goes up the Congo never, comes back.  It's a  fool's trip among those wild people of the interior.  Stanley went  up, but look at the big party he took with him and the many fights  he had to get back alive.\"    At this announcement the hearts of the Rover boys fell.    \"You never heard one word of him?\" persisted Sam.    \"Nary a word, sonny.  I reckon he's either lost in the jungle or  among the mountains, or else the natives have taken care of him.\"    \"Did he say anything about the trail he was going to take?\" asked  Randolph Rover.  \"I understand there are several.\"    \"He was going to take the Rumbobo trail, most all of 'em do.\"  Simon Hook drew a long breath.  \"Say, can I sell you any of these  old things of mine cheap?\"    \"Perhaps you can,\" said Randolph Rover.    \"We are bound for the hotel now.  We will come in later.\"    \"Glad to see you,\" and as they left the shopkeeper waved them a  pleasant adieu with his hand.  But he never stirred from his  chair.    \"I guess he has grown tired of trying to sell goods,\" observed  Tom.    \"Perhaps he knows that if folks want the things he has to sell  they are bound to come to him,\" said Dick.  \"His store seems to  be the only one of its sort around.\"    The hotel for which they were bound was several squares away,  located in something of a park, with pretty flowers and a  fountain.  It was a two-story affair, with spacious verandas and  large rooms, and frequented mostly by English and French people.    They had just entered the office; and Randolph Rover was writing  his name in the register, when Dick caught sight of somebody in  the reading room that nearly took away his breath.    \"Well, I never!\"    \"What is it, Dick?\" asked Tom quickly.    \"Look at that boy reading a newspaper.  It is Dan Baxter--Dan  Baxter, just as sure as you are born!\"          CHAPTER XV    CAPTAIN VILLAIRE'S LITTLE PLOT      Dick was right: the boy in the reading-room' was indeed Dan Baxter,  but so changed in appearance that for the minute neither Tom nor  Sam recognized him.    In the past Baxter had always been used to fine clothing, which he  had taken care should be in good repair.  Now his clothing was  dilapidated and his shoes looked as if they were about ready to  fall apart.    More than this, his face was hollow and careworn, and one eye  looked as if it had suffered severe blow of some sort.  Altogether  he was most wretched-looking specimen of humanity, and it was a  wonder that he was allowed at the hotel.  But the truth of the  matter was that he had told the proprietor a long tale of  sufferings in the interior and of a delayed remittance from home,  and the hotel keeper was keeping him solely on this account.    \"How he is changed!\" muttered Tom.  \"He looks like a regular  tramp!\"    \"He's been in hard luck, that's certain,\" came from Sam.  \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5780"],[0,"The Rover Boys at School; Or, The Cadets of Putnam Hall (#13)"],[1,"the four fellows who are here.\"    \"Very well; I will bring a like number.\"    \"Want to tell everybody, don't you?\"    \"No, but I think I am entitled to fair play; and that means that I  must have as many friends there as you have.\"    \"All right,\" grumbled Baxter, but he evidently did not like the  arrangement.  A moment later he hurried off, to do what he could  to prevent his nose from swelling.    Dick told only his brothers and his chums of what had occurred,  but the news leaked out that a fight was on, and Saturday  afternoon found at least twenty cadets in the secret and on their  way to witness the \"mill,\" as those who had read something about  prize-fighting were wont to call the contest.    Now, lest my readers obtain a false impression of my views on this  subject, let me state plainly that I do not believe in fights,  between boys or otherwise. They are brutal, far from manly, and  add nothing to the strength of one's character.  It is well enough  to know how to defend one's self when occasion requires, but such  occasions occur but rarely.    But I have set out to relate the adventures of the Rover boys, in  school and out, and on land and sea, and I feel I must be truthful  and tell everything just as it happened, not only in this volume,  but in all those which are to follow; and, consequently, I shall  tell of the fight as the particulars were related to me by Sam  Rover, Fred Garrison and others--details which I am certain are  correct.    The spot was a sheltered one, and on the edge of the woods two  spies were posted, to warn the contestants should Josiah Crabtree  or any of the other teachers appear, for fighting was against the  rules of Putnam Hall, and neither Dick nor Baxter wanted to be  caught.    Both came to the spot promptly, and, without preliminary talking,  took off their coats, collars, ties, and caps.  A ring was formed,  and Dick stepped forward and faced Baxter.    The bully was several inches taller than his opponent and at least  fifteen pounds heavier.  His nose was a bit swollen, and there was  a sneer upon his coarse face.    \"Rover, if you wish to apologize to me you can do so, and save  yourself a thrashing,\" he remarked.    \"I can take care of myself, Baxter.  Perhaps you would like me to  make a similar proposition to you.  If so, let me say it is too  late; I came here to give you a well-deserved thrashing, and I  mean to stick to my determination.\"    \"Phew, but we talk big!\" muttered Mumps.    \"You keep your oar out, Mumps,\" put in Tom. \"If you don't I'll give  you a hiding, just as soon as Dick is done with Dan.\"    \"Will you?  Maybe you'll be the one to catch it,\" muttered Mumps.  Nevertheless, he said no more.    \"Are you ready?\" asked the boy who acted as timekeeper.    \"I am,\" said Dick.    \"So am I,\" returned Baxter, and hurled himself at his opponent  without a second's delay.    He had expected to catch Dick napping, but he found himself  mistaken.  A blow aimed at Dick's face was well parried, and in  return Dick hit Baxter heavily on the shoulder.    \"Hurrah!  Score one for Dick!\" cried Larry Colby.  \"That's right,  old man, keep at him.\"    \"Keep cool, Dan!\" put in Mumps.  \"You can polish him off at your  leisure.\"    The blow on the shoulder staggered Baxter, and he fell back, to  become more cautious; and then the two boys began to circle around  and around, each looking for a favorable \"opening.\"  At last  Baxter thought he saw what he wanted, and struck out again, and  Dick was hit on the cheek.    \"That's the way, Baxter!\" came the cry.    \"That was a teaser!  Give him another!\"    Again Baxter launched out, and now Dick was hit on the arm.  He  slipped to one side, and struck out like lightning, and the bully  caught it in the neck, something which, spun him around like a  top.    \"Another for Dick!\" cried Frank Harrington.  \"Keep it up!\"    Again the two boys faced each other.  But only for an instant.  With a savage cry Baxter sprang upon Dick as if to fairly tear him  apart.  One blow landed upon Dick's arm and a second on his chest.    \"It's Baxter's fight!  Baxter is still king of this school!\"    \"You might as well give it up, Rover; he's too many for you!\"    So the cries ran on, while the bully, encouraged by his success,  renewed his efforts; and an additional blow sent Dick to the  ground in a heap.          CHAPTER XII    FAIR AND FOUL FIGHTING      As Dick went down, Tom and Sam uttered cries of chagrin and  horror.  The eldest Rover had been struck on the chin, and the  blood was flowing from a deep scratch.    \"Get up!  Get up, Dick!\" cried Tom.  \"Don't say you are beaten!\"    \"Yes, yes; get up and go at him!\" added Sam.    The urging was unnecessary, as Dick was already scrambling up.  Dan Baxter made a dash at him, intending to strike him while he  was down, but a fierce look from Tom stopped him.    \"You'll fight fair, Baxter,\" were Tom's words.    \"Yes, he'll fight fair,\" repeated Dick, throwing back his head as  if to collect himself.  \"Fellow-students, Dan Baxter is not fit to  be a pupil at this academy.\"    \"Why not?\" came in a chorus.    \"He is not fighting me fairly.\"    \"What do you mean?\" blustered Mumps.    \"Don't find fault because he knocked you down,\" added another of  the bully's cronies.    \"I say he is not fighting fair,\" repeated Dick stoutly.  \"He has  something in each hand.\"    At this unexpected announcement Dan Baxter started back and  changed color.  Then of a sudden he placed both hands into his  trouser pockets.    \"He is putting the things out of sight!\" cried Tom, who saw  through the bully's intentions.    \"Come, Baxter, show us what you had.\"    \"I didn't have anything,\" growled the bully.  \"If you say I had  I'll punch your head off.  This is only a ruse to, let Dick gain  time to get his wind.\"    \"That's it!\" cried Mumps.  \"Go at him, Dan, and finish him!\"    \"Baxter daren't turn out his pockets,\" said Sam, \"Do it if you  dare.\"    \"There is what I have in them,\" answered the bully, pulling a  trunk key from one pocket and some small change from the other.  \"Perhaps you'll say I was fighting with these in my hands.\"    \"Turn the pockets, out!\" demanded Dick.    \"Yes, turn 'em out!\" added Fred, and a dozen others took up the  cry.    \"I won't do it,\" growled Baxter, but it was plain to see that he  was growing uneasy.  \"I'm a gentleman, and I can whip Rover with  ease, and do it fairly, too!\"    While he was speaking Larry Colby had come up behind him.  Ere  Baxter could stop the movement, Larry pushed his hand into one of  the bully's pockets and turned it out.  A jagged stone as big as a  walnut dropped to the ground.    \"There, see that!\" cried Larry.  \"For shame, Baxter!\"    \"I didn't have the stone--you placed it there!\" blustered the  so-styled king of the school.    \"Didn't you though?\" said Fred Garrison, who had also come up  behind Baxter, and he quickly hauled another stone from the other  pocket.    \"That is how he scratched me,\" said Dick.  \"I was sure he had  something in his hand.\"    \"It's a put-up job!\" howled Baxter, growing red in the face.  \"If  you want to continue the fight, come on!\" and he squared off  again.    \"That's the talk!\" said Mumps.  \"Let both show their hands!  Perhaps Rover has some stones, too!\"    Both opened their palms, then doubled up their fists.  Baxter was  the first to strike out.  But, as quick as lightning, Dick dodged  the blow and landed vigorously upon the bully's chest.  Before  Baxter could recover, Dick struck out again, and the bully caught  it straight in the left eye.    \"Oh!\" he yelled in pain, and put his hand up to the injured optic,  which began to grow black rapidly.  Then he struck out wildly half  a dozen times.  He was growing excited, while Dick was as calm as  ever.  Watching his opportunity, Dick struck out with all his  force, and Baxter received a crack on the nose which caused him to  fall back into the arms of Mumps.  As that nose had been struck  heavily in the gymnasium, it was decidedly tender, and Baxter  roared with pain.    \"Have you had enough?\" demanded Dick, coming up to him.    Yes--Baxter had had more than enough; but he did not wish to  acknowledge it.  He made a sign to Mumps previously agreed upon,  and Mumps raised his cap as a signal to one of the spies set on  guard.    \"Stop the fight!\" cried the guard instantly.  \"Somebody is  coming!\"    \"Nonsense--nobody is coming!\" said the other spy, but Baxter  would not listen to him.    \"I'm not going to be caught--I'll finish this some other time,\"  he said to Dick, and hurried away with Mumps and his other  friends, leaving Dick the victor beyond question.    \"I knew you could do it!\" cried Tom, as he fairly hugged his elder  brother.    \"I'll wager he won't bother you again.\"    \"No, indeed!\" put in Sam; and Fred and the others said the same.  That was the first and last time that Dan Baxter fought any of the  boys openly, but he was their bitter enemy in secret; we shall  learn in this and other volumes.    As soon as Baxter had retreated, Dick and his brothers hurried to  a near-by brook, where the elder Rover took a wash, and tried by  other means to remove the traces of the contest from his person.  He had a slight swelling on the scratched chin, but that was all,  and inside of an hour felt quite like himself once more.    With Baxter it was very different, and the Sunday following he  asked to be excused from attending church services in the Hall,  saying he had fallen on some rocks and hurt his face.  On hearing  this, Captain Putnam came to see him.    \"Sorry to hear this, Baxter,\" he said.  \"Do you think you need a  doctor?\"    \"No, sir; I'll be all right in a few days.\"    \"Where did you fall?\"    \"Down by the brook, while we were playing tag.\"    \"Indeed!  Well, you want to be more careful in the future,\" was  Captain Putnam's advice, and then he left Baxter.  If he suspected  anything he did not let on.  To a certain extent he believed in"]]]
