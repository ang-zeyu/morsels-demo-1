You can  only depend on getting tucker _once_ at one place; then you must tramp  on to the next. If you cannot get it once you must go short; but there  is a lot of energy in an empty stomach. If you get an extra supply you  may camp for a day and have a spell. To live you must walk. To cease  walking is to die.    The Exception is an outcast amongst bush outcasts, and looks better  fitted for Sydney Domain. He lies on the bottom of a galvanized-iron  case, with a piece of blue blanket for a pillow. He is dressed in a blue  cotton jumper, a pair of very old and ragged tweed trousers, and one  boot and one slipper. He found the slipper in the last shed, and the  boot in the rubbish-heap here. When his own boots gave out he walked  a hundred and fifty miles with his feet roughly sewn up in pieces of  sacking from an old wool-bale. No sign of a patch, or an attempt at  mending anywhere about his clothes, and that is a bad sign; when a  swagman leaves off mending or patching his garments, his case is about  hopeless. The Exception's swag consists of the aforesaid bit of blanket  rolled up and tied with pieces of rag. He has no water-bag; carries  his water in a billy; and how he manages without a bag is known only to  himself. He has read every scrap of print within reach, and now lies on  his side, with his face to the wall and one arm thrown up over his  head; the jumper is twisted back, and leaves his skin bare from hip to  arm-pit. His lower face is brutal, his eyes small and shifty, and ugly  straight lines run across his low forehead. He says very little, but  scowls most of the time--poor devil. He might be, or at least _seem_, a  totally different man under more favourable conditions. He is probably a  free labourer.    A very sick jackaroo lies in one of the bunks. A sandy, sawney-looking  Bourke native takes great interest in this wreck; watches his every  movement as though he never saw a sick man before. The men lie about in  the bunks, or the shade of the hut, and rest, and read all the soiled  and mutilated scraps of literature they can rake out of the rubbish, and  sleep, and wake up swimming in perspiration, and growl about the heat.    It _is_ hot, and two shearers' cats--a black and a white one--sit in one  of the upper bunks with their little red tongues out, panting like dogs.  These cats live well during shearing, and take their chances the rest of  the year--just as shed rouseabouts have to do. They seem glad to see  the traveller come; he makes things more homelike. They curl and sidle  affectionately round the table-legs, and the legs of the men, and purr,  and carry their masts up, and regard the cooking with feline interest  and approval, and look as cheerful as cats can--and as contented. God  knows how many tired, dusty, and sockless ankles they rub against in  their time.    Now and then a man takes his tucker-bags and goes down to the station  for a bit of flour, or meat, or tea, or sugar, choosing the time when  the manager is likely to be out on the run. The cook here is a \"good  cook,\" from a traveller's point of view; too good to keep his place  long.    Occasionally someone gets some water in an old kerosene-tin and washes  a shirt or pair of trousers, and a pair or two of socks--or  foot-rags--(Prince Alfreds they call them). That is, he soaks some of  the stiffness out of these articles.    Three times a day the black billies and cloudy nose-bags are placed on  the table. The men eat in a casual kind of way, as though it were only  a custom of theirs, a matter of form--a habit which could be left off if  it were worth while.    The Exception is heard to remark to no one in particular that he'll give  all he has for a square meal.    \"An' ye'd get it cheap, begod!\" says a big Irish shearer. \"Come and have  dinner with us; there's plenty there.\"    But the Exception only eats a few mouthfuls, and his appetite is gone;  his stomach has become contracted, perhaps.    The Wreck cannot eat at all, and seems internally disturbed by the sight  of others eating.    One of the men is a cook, and this morning he volunteered good-naturedly  to bake bread for the rest. His mates amuse themselves by chyacking him.    \"I've heard he's a dirty and slow cook,\" says one, addressing Eternity.    \"Ah!\" says the cook, \"you'll be glad to come to me for a pint of flour  when I'm cooking and you're on the track, some day.\"    Sunset. Some of the men sit at the end of the hut to get the full  benefit of a breeze which comes from the west. A great bank of  rain-clouds is rising in that direction, but no one says he thinks it  will rain; neither does anybody think we're going to have some rain.  None but the greenest jackaroo would venture that risky and foolish  observation. Out here, it can look more like rain without raining, and  continue to do so for a longer time, than in most other places.    The Wreck went down to the station this afternoon to get some medicine  and bush medical advice. The Bourke sawney helped him to do up his swag;  he did it with an awed look and manner, as though he thought it a great  distinction to be allowed to touch the belongings of such a curiosity.  It was afterwards generally agreed that it was a good idea for the Wreck  to go to the station; he would get some physic and, a bit of tucker to  take him on. \"For they'll give tucker to a sick man sooner than to a  chap what's all right.\"    The Exception is rooting about in the rubbish for the other blucher  boot.    The men get a little more sociable, and \"feel\" each other to find out  who's \"Union,\" and talk about water, and exchange hints as to good  tucker-tracks, and discuss the strike, and curse the squatter (which  is all they have got to curse), and growl about Union leaders, and tell  lies against each other sociably. There are tally lies; and lies about  getting tucker by trickery; and long-tramp-with-heavy-swag-and-no-water  lies; and lies about getting the best of squatters and  bosses-over-the-board; and droving, fighting, racing, gambling and  drinking lies. Lies _ad libitum_; and every true Australian bushman must  try his best to tell a bigger out-back lie than the last bush-liar.    Pat is not quite easy in his mind. He found an old pair of pants in the  scrub this morning, and cannot decide whether they are better than his  own, or, rather, whether his own are worse--if that's possible. He does  not want to increase the weight of his swag unnecessarily by taking both  pairs. He reckons that the pants were thrown away when the shed cut out  last, but then they might have been lying out exposed to the weather  for a longer period. It is rather an important question, for it is very  annoying, after you've mended and patched an old pair of pants, to find,  when a day or two further on the track, that they are more rotten than  the pair you left behind.    There is some growling about the water here, and one of the men makes a  billy of tea. The water is better cooked. Pint-pots and sugar-bags  are groped out and brought to the kitchen hut, and each man fills his  pannikin; the Irishman keeps a thumb on the edge of his, so as to  know when the pot is full, for it is very dark, and there is no more  firewood. You soon know this way, especially if you are in the habit of  pressing lighted tobacco down into your pipe with the top of your thumb.  The old slush-lamps are all burnt out.    Each man feels for the mouth of his sugar-bag with one hand while he  keeps the bearings of his pot with the other.    The Irishman has lost his match-box, and feels for it all over the table  without success. He stoops down with his hands on his knees, gets the  table-top on a level with the flicker of firelight, and \"moons\" the  object, as it were.    Time to turn in. It is very dark inside and bright moonlight without;  every crack seems like a ghost peering in. Some of the men will roll  up their swags on the morrow and depart; some will take another day's  spell. It is all according to the tucker.          THE UNION BURIES ITS DEAD      While out boating one Sunday afternoon on a billabong across the river,  we saw a young man on horseback driving some horses along the bank. He  said it was a fine day, and asked if the Water was deep there. The joker  of our party said it was deep enough to drown him, and he laughed and  rode farther up. We didn't take-much notice of him.    Next day a funeral gathered at a corner pub and asked each other in to  have a drink while waiting for the hearse. They passed away some of the  time dancing jigs to a piano in the bar parlour. They passed away the  rest of the time skylarking and fighting.    The defunct was a young Union labourer, about twenty-five, who had  been drowned the previous day while trying to swim some horses across a  billabong of the Darling.    He was almost a stranger in town, and the fact of his having been a  Union man accounted for the funeral. The police found some Union papers  in his swag, and called at the General Labourers' Union Office for  information about him. That's how we knew. The secretary had very little  information to give. The departed was a \"Roman,\" and the majority of  the town were otherwise--but Unionism is stronger than creed. Liquor,  however, is stronger than Unionism; and, when the hearse presently  arrived, more than two-thirds of the funeral were unable to follow.    The procession numbered fifteen, fourteen souls following the broken  shell of a soul. Perhaps not one of the fourteen possessed a soul any  more than the corpse did--but that doesn't matter.    Four or five of the funeral, who were boarders at the pub, borrowed a  trap which the landlord used to carry passengers to and from the railway  station. They were strangers to us who were on foot, and we to them. We  were all strangers to the corpse.    A horseman, who looked like a drover just returned from a big trip, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7188"],[0,"Higher Lessons in English: A work on English grammar and composition (#13)"],[1,"also, _singing_ has the  nature of a verb and that of a noun. As a verb it has an adverb modifier,  _sweetly_, and as a noun it names an act and takes a possessive modifier.    This form of the verb is called the +Participle+ (Lat. _pars_, a part, and  _capere_, to take) because it partakes of two natures and performs two  offices--those of a verb and an adjective, or those of a verb and a noun.  (For definition see Lesson 131.)    _Singing birds delight us_. Here _singing_ has lost its verbal nature, and  expresses a permanent quality of birds--telling what kind of birds,--and  consequently is a mere adjective. _The singing of the birds delights us_.  Here _singing_ is simply a noun, naming the act and taking adjective  modifiers.    There are two kinds of participles; [Footnote: Grammarians are not agreed  as to what these words that have the nature of the verb and that of the  noun should be called. Some would call the simple forms _doing_, _writing_,  and _injuring_, in sentences (1), (6), and (7), Lesson 38, _Infinitives_.  They would also call by the same name such compound forms as _being  accepted_, _having been shown_, and _having said_ in these expressions:  \"for the purpose of being accepted;\" \"is the having been shown over a  place;\" \"I recollect his having said that.\" But does it not tax even  credulity to believe that a simple Anglo-Saxon infinitive in _-an_, only  one form of which followed a preposition, and that always _to_, could have  developed into many compound forms, used in both voices, following almost  any preposition, and modified by _the_ and by nouns and pronouns in the  possessive? No wonder the grammarian Mason says, \"An infinitive in _-ing_,  set down by some as a modification of the simple infinitive in _-an_ or  _-en_, is a perfectly unwarranted invention.\"    Others call these words modernized forms of the Anglo-Saxon _Verbal Nouns_  in _-ung_, _-ing_. But this derivation of them encounters the stubborn fact  that those verbal nouns never were compound, and never were or could be  followed by objects. These words, on the contrary, are compound, as we have  seen, and have objects. That they are from nouns in _-ung_ is otherwise,  and almost for the same reasons, as incredible as that they are from  infinitives in _-an_.    Others call these words _Gerunds_. A gerund in Latin is a simple form of  the verb in the active voice, never found in the nominative, and never in  the accusative (objective) after a verb. A gerund in Anglo-Saxon is a  simple form of the verb in the active voice--the dative case of the  infinitive merely--used mainly to indicate purpose, and always preceded by  the preposition _to_. To call these words in question gerunds is to stretch  the term _gerund_ immensely beyond its meaning in Anglo-Saxon, and make it  cover words which sometimes (1) are highly compounded; sometimes (2) are  used in the passive voice; sometimes (3) follow other prepositions than  _to_; sometimes (4) do not follow any preposition; sometimes (5) are  objects of verbs; sometimes (6) are subjects of verbs; sometimes (7) are  modified by _the_; sometimes (8) are modified by a noun or pronoun in the  possessive; and generally (9) do not indicate purpose. We submit that the  extension of a class term so as to include words having these relations  that the Anglo-Saxon gerund never had, is not warranted by any precedent  except that furnished above in the extension of the term _infinitive_ or of  the term _verbal noun_!    Still others call some of these words _Infinitives_; some of them _Verbal  Nouns_; and some of them _Gerunds_.    The forms in question--_seeing, having seen, being seen, having been seen_,  and _having been seeing_, for instance--are now made from the verb in  precisely the same way when partaking the nature of the noun as when  partaking the nature of the adjective. What can they possibly be but the  forms that all grammarians call _participles_ extended to new uses? If the  uses of the original participles have been extended, why may we not carry  over the name? The name _participle_ is as true to its etymology when  applied to the nounal use of the verb as when applied to the adjectival  use. For convenience of classification we call these disputed forms  _participles_, as good grammarians long ago called them and still call  them, though some of them may be traced back to the Saxon verbal noun or to  the infinitive, and though the Saxon participle was adjectival. The name  _participle_ neither confounds terms nor misleads the student. The nounal  and the adjectival uses of participial forms we distinguish very sharply.]  one sharing the nature of the verb and that of the adjective; the other,  the nature of the verb and that of the noun. Participles commonly end in  _ing_, _ed_, or _en_.    The participle, like other forms of the verb, may be followed by an object  complement or an attribute complement.    Analysis and Parsing.    The +participle+ may be used as an +adjective modifier+.    1. Hearing a step, I turned.       I | turned    ===|=========     \\ |      \\ hea       \\   ring | step        --------|------                   \\a    +Explanation+.--The line standing for the participle is broken; one part  slants to represent the adjective nature of the participle, and the other  is horizontal to represent its verbal nature.    +Oral Analysis+.--The phrase _hearing a step_ is a modifier of the subject;  [Footnote: Logically, or in sense, _hearing a step_ modifies the predicate  also. I _turned when_ or _because_ I heard a step. See Lesson 79.] the  principal word is _hearing_, which is completed by the noun _step_; _step_  is modified by _a_.    +Parsing+.--_Hearing_ is a form of the verb called participle because the  act expressed by it is merely assumed, and it shares the nature of an  adjective and that of a verb.    2. The fat of the body is fuel laid away for use.    +Explanation+.--The complement is here modified by a participle phrase.    3. The spinal marrow, proceeding from the brain, extends down-ward through     the back-bone.  4. Van Twiller sat in a huge chair of solid oak, hewn in the celebrated     forest of the Hague.    +Explanation+.--The principal word of a prepositional phrase is here  modified by a participle phrase.    5. Lentulus, returning with victorious legions, had amused the populace     with the sports of the amphitheater.    The +participle+ may be used as an +attribute complement+.    6. The natives came crowding around.    +Explanation+.--_Crowding_ here completes the predicate _came_, and belongs  to the subject _natives_. The natives are represented as performing the act  of coming and the accompanying act of crowding. The assertive force of the  predicate _came_ seems to extend over both verbs. [Footnote: Some  grammarians prefer to treat the participle in such constructions as  adverbial. But is _crowding_ any more adverbial here than are _pale_ and  _trembling_ in \"The natives came _pale_ and _trembling_\"?]    7. The city lies sleeping.  8. They stood terrified.  9. The philosopher sat buried in thought.           \\and \\and \\          \\....\\....\\           \\    \\    \\star            \\    \\    \\   ving             \\    \\sav \\-------              \\    \\  ing               \\gru \\----------                \\  bbing                 \\-------------                         |  miser | kept   \\      / \\  ======|======================        |    10. The old miser kept grubbing and saving and starving.    The +participle+ may be used as an +objective complement+.    11. He kept me waiting.    +Explanation+.--_Waiting_ completes _kept_ and relates to the object  complement _me_. _Kept-waiting_ expresses the complete act performed upon  me. _He kept-waiting me_=_He detained me_. The relation of _waiting_ to  _me_ may be seen by changing the form of the verb; as, I _was kept  waiting_. See Lesson 31.    12. I found my book growing dull. [Footnote: It will be seen by this and  following examples that we extend the application of the term _objective  complement_ beyond its primary, or factitive, sense. In \"I struck the man  _dead_,\" the condition expressed by _dead_ is the result of the act  expressed by _struck_. In \"I found the man _dead_,\" the condition is not  the result of the act, and so grammarians say that in this second example  _dead_ should be treated simply as an \"appositive\" adjective modifying  _man_. While _dead_ does not belong to _man_ as expressing the result of  the act, it is made to belong to _man_ through the asserting force of the  verb, and therefore is not a mere modifier of _man_. _Dead_ helps _found_  to express the act. Not _found_, but _found-dead_ tells what was done to  the man.    If we put the sentence in the passive form, \"The man was found _dead_,\" it  will be seen that _dead_ is more than a mere modifier; it belongs to _man_  through the assertive force of _was found_. If _dead_ is here merely an  \"appositive\" adjective, \"I found the man dead\" must equal \"I found the man,  who was dead\" (or, \"and he was dead\"). The two sentences obviously are not  equal. \"I caught him asleep\" does not mean, \"I caught him, and he was  asleep.\"    If, in the construction discussed above, _dead_ is an objective complement,  _quiet_, _stirring_, and (to) _stir_ in the  following sentences are objective complements:--        I saw the leaves quiet.      I saw the leaves stirring.      I saw the leaves stir.    The adjective, the participle, and the infinitive do not here seem to  differ essentially in office.
