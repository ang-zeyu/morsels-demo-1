And Julia  pretty nearly bosses everything and everybody around this school. Her  father, Mr. Semple, you see, is chairman of the school board.\"    Her plain-spoken friend never realized how much she was hurting Ruth  by telling her this. Ruth's pride kept her up, nor would she make  further overtures toward friendship with her classmates. She  determined, during those first few days at the district school, that  she would do her very best to get ahead and to win the commendation of  her teacher. There was a splendid high school at Cheslow, and she  learned that Miss Cramp could graduate pupils from her school directly  into the Cheslow High. It was possible, the teacher assured her, for  Ruth to fit herself for such advancement between that time and the  fall term.    It seemed as though Ruth could never make her crotchety old uncle love  her. As time passed, the loss of his cash-box seemed to prey upon the  miller's mind more and more. He never spoke of it in the house again;  it is doubtful if he spoke of it elsewhere. But the loss of the money  increased (were that possible) his moroseness. He often spoke to  neither the girl nor Aunt Alvirah from sunrise to sunset.    But although Uncle Jabez was so moody and so unkind to her, in the  little old woman, whose back and whose bones gave her so much trouble,  Ruth found a loving and thoughtful friend. Aunt Alvirah was as  troubled at first about Ruth's lack of frocks as the girl was herself.  But before Ruth had been attending school a week, she suddenly became  very light-hearted upon the question of dress.    \"Now, don't you fret about it, deary,\" said Aunt Alviry, wagging her  head knowingly. \"Gals like you has jest got ter hev frocks, an' the  good Lord knows it, jest the same as He knows when a sparrer falls.  There'll be a way pervided--there'll be a way pervided. Ef I can't  make ye a purty dress, 'cause o' my back an' my bones, there's them  that kin. We'll hev Miss 'Cretia Lock in by the day, and we'll make  'em.\"    \"But, dear,\" said Ruth, wonderingly, \"how will we get the goods--and  the trimmings--and pay Miss Lock for her work?\"    \"Don't you fret about that. Jest you wait and see,\" declared Aunt  Alvirah, mysteriously.    Ruth knew very well that the old woman had not a penny of her own.  Uncle Jabez would never have given her a cent without knowing just  what it was for, and haggling over the expenditure then, a good deal.  To his view, Aunt Alviry was an object of his charity, too, although  for more than ten years the old woman had kept his house like wax and  had saved him the wages of a housekeeper.    This very day, on coming home from school, Ruth had met Doctor Davison  coming away from the Red Mill. She thought the red and white mare,  that was so spirited and handsome, had been tied to the post in front  of the kitchen door, and that the physician must have called upon Aunt  Alvirah.    \"So this is the young lady who wouldn't stop at my house but went to  Sam Curtis' to stay all night,\" he said, holding in the mare and  looking down at Ruth. \"And you haven't been past the gate with the  green eyes since?\"    \"No, sir,\" Ruth said, timidly. \"I have never even been to town.\"    \"No. Or you would not have failed to see the Curtises again. At least,  I hope you'll see them. Mercy has never ceased talking about you.\"    \"The lame girl, sir?\" cried Ruth, in wonder. \"Why, she spoke awfully  unkindly to me, and I thought her mother only thought I would feel bad  and wanted to smooth it over, when she asked me to come again.\"    \"No,\" said the doctor, seriously, shaking his head. \"Nobody knows  Mercy like her mother. That's not to be expected. She's a poor,  unfortunate, cramp-minded child. I've done what I can for her back--  she has spinal trouble; but I can do little for Mercy's twisted and  warped mind. She tells me she has cramps in her back and legs and I  tell her she has worse cramps in her mind. Bright! Why, child, she  knows more than most grown folks. Reads every book she can get hold  of; there is scarcely a child in the Cheslow High School who could  compete with her for a month in any study she had a mind to take hold  of. But,\" and the doctor shook his head again, \"her mind's warped and  cramped because of her affliction.\"    \"I pitied her,\" said Ruth, quietly.    \"But don't tell her so. Go and see her again--that's all. And mind  you don't come to town without turning in at the gate with the green  eyes;\" and so saying he let the eager mare out and she swiftly carried  him away.    It was after this Aunt Alvirah seemed so confident that a way would be  provided for Ruth to get the frocks that she so sadly needed. On the  very next day, when Ruth came home from school, she found the little  old lady in a flutter of excitement.    \"Now, Ruthie,\" she whispered, \"you mustn't ask too many questions, and  I'll surely tell ye a gre't secret, child.\"    \"It must be something very nice, Aunt Alviry, or you'd never be like  this. What is it?\"    \"Now Ruthie, you mustn't ask too many questions, I tell you. But to  make no secret of it, for secrets I do despise, somebody's made you a  present.\"    \"Made me a present?\" gasped Ruth.    \"Now, careful about questions,\" warned Aunt Alvirah. \"I told you that  a way would be pervided for you to have frocks. And it is true. You  are a-goin' to have 'em.\"    \"Auntie! New frocks!\"    \"Just as good as new. Ev'ry bit as good as new. Somebody that's--  that's seen ye, deary, and knows how badly you want to go to school,  and that you need dresses, has given you three.\"    \"My goodness me!\" cried Ruth, clasping her hands. \"Not three?\"    \"Yes, my dear. And they're jest as good as new--about. 'Cretia Lock  won't be two days fixin' 'em over to fit you. And you won't mind,  deary, if the little girl who wore them before you is--is--Well,  deary, she won't never want them any more.\"    \"Oh, my dear!\" cried Ruth. \"Three frocks all at once! And--and I'm  not to ask who gave them to me?\"    \"That's it. You're not to ask that. I'll git 'em and show you--Oh, my  back and oh, my bones! Oh, my back and oh, my bones!\" the old lady  added, starting from her chair and hobbling out of the room.    Ruth was so amazed that she hardly knew what her other feelings at the  moment might be. But there had sprung into her mind, full-fledged, the  suspicion that Doctor Davison had been the donor of the frocks.  Perhaps he had had a little girl sometime, who had died. For Ruth had  quite decided, from what Aunt Alvirah said, that the girl who had  formerly worn the frocks in question was no longer upon earth.      CHAPTER XVI     BEHIND THE GREEN LAMPS    Aunt Alvirah returned in a short time with such a pile of pretty  colors over her arm that Ruth gasped with delight, she couldn't help  it The dresses were all nice ginghams, each of a different color,  nicely trimmed and delightfully made. They were not too fancy for  school wear, and they were good, practical frocks.    Ruth had worn her little black and white frocks at school while she  was still in Darrowtown, and had she remained longer Miss True Pettis  would have helped her to make other frocks in colors. It is a sad  thing to see a child in black, or black and white, and Ruth's father  had been dead now six months.    \"Ye needn't be scart at the colors, child,\" said old Aunt Alviry.  \"Here's this pretty lavender. We'll make that over first. 'Cretia Lock  will be here to-morrow and we'll make a big beginnin'.\"    \"But what will uncle say?\" gasped Ruth, almost bursting with  questions, but being debarred from asking the most important ones.    \"Don't you fret about your Uncle Jabez. He ain't got nothin' ter do  with it,\" declared the little old woman, firmly. \"Nor he won't say  nothin'.\"    Which was very true. Uncle Jabez seldom spoke to his niece now. His  moodiness grew upon him as time passed. And in the evening, as he sat  over his endless calculations at the kitchen table, the girl and the  old woman scarcely dared speak to each other save in whispers.    Miss Lock worked three days, instead of two, at the Red Mill, helping  Aunt Alvirah \"dress-make.\" How she was paid, Ruth did not know; but  she feared that the pennies Aunt Alvirah saved from her egg and  chicken money had done this. However, the shabby black frock was put  away and Ruth blossomed out into as pretty an appearance as any girl  attending Miss Cramp's school.    But she did not make friends among her classmates. Julia Semple had  such influence that she seemed to have set all the girls of the higher  class in the district school against Ruth. Julia herself could not  pass Ruth without tossing her head and staring at her haughtily; and  sometimes she would whisper to her companions and look at the girl  from the Red Mill in so scornful a way that Ruth could not help  feeling uncomfortable.    Indeed, Ruth would have lacked almost all young company had it not  been for Helen Cameron and Tom. Tom didn't think much of \"playing with  girls;\" but he could always be depended upon to do anything Ruth and  Helen wanted him to. Helen was at the Red Mill often after Ruth's  school hours, and seldom did a Saturday pass that the two chums did  not spend at least half the day together. Aunt Alvirah declared Ruth  should have Saturday afternoons to herself, and often Helen came in  her little pony carriage and drove Ruth about the country. There was a  fat old pony named Tubby that drew the phaeton, and Tubby jogged along  the pleasant country roads with them in a most delightfully gypsyish  way.    One Saturday afternoon they went to town. Ruth had never seen Cheslow  save on the night of her arrival and on the following morning, when  she had started directly after breakfast at the station master's house  to walk to the Red Mill.    \"Why, you'll like Cheslow,\" declared Helen, in her enthusiastic way.  \"It's just as pretty as it can be--you'll love it! I often drive in  to shop,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/499"],[0,"Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders; Or, The Underground Search for the Idol of (#13)"],[1,"determined to get that idol of gold.    \"Well, it can't be helped, and we must make the best of it,\" said Tom,  after a pause.    \"True.  But now, boys, let's have breakfast, and then we'll make what  goods we can't take with us as snug as possible, until we can send the  mule drivers after them,\" went on Professor Bumper.    \"Send the mule drivers after them?\" questioned Ned.  \"What do you mean  to do?\"    \"Do?  Why keep on, of course.  You don't suppose I'm going to let a  little thing like this stand between me and the discovery of Kurzon and  the idol of gold, do you?\"    \"But,\" began Mr. Damon, \"I don't see how--\"    \"Oh, we'll find a way,\" interrupted Tom.  \"It isn't the first time I've  been pretty well stranded on an expedition of this kind, and sometimes  from the same cause--the actions of a rival.  Now we'll turn the tables  on the other fellows and see how they like it.  The professor's  right--let's have breakfast.  Jacinto seems to have told the truth.  Nothing of ours is missing.\"    Tom and Ned got the meal, and then a consultation was held as to what  was best to be done.    \"We can't go on any further by water, that's sure,\" said Tom.  \"In the  first place the river is too shallow, and secondly we have no canoes.  So the only thing is to go on foot through the jungle.\"    \"But how can we, and carry all this stuff?\" asked Ned.    \"We needn't carry it!\" cried Professor Bumper.  \"We'll leave it here,  where it will be safe enough, and tramp on to the nearest Indian  village.  There we'll hire bearers to take our stuff on until we can  get mules.  I'm not going to turn back!\"    \"Good!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my rubber boots! but that's what I  say--keep on!\"    \"Oh, no! we'll never turn back,\" agreed Tom.    \"But how can we manage it?\" asked Ned.    \"We've just got to! And when you have to do a thing, it's a whole lot  easier to do than if you just feel as though you ought to.  So, lively  is the word!\" cried Tom, in answer.    \"We'll pack up what we can carry and leave the rest,\" added the  scientist.    Being an experienced traveler Professor Bumper had arranged his baggage  so that it could be carried by porters if necessary.  Everything could  be put into small packages, including the tents and food supply.    \"There are four of us,\" remarked Tom, \"and if we can not pack enough  along with us to enable us to get to the nearest village, we had better  go back to civilization.  I'm not afraid to try.\"    \"Nor I!\" cried Mr. Damon.    The baggage, stores and supplies that were to be left behind were made  as snug as possible, and so piled up that wild beasts could do the  least harm.  Then a pack was made up for each one to carry.    They would take weapons, of course, Tom Swift's electric rifle being  the one he choose for himself.  They expected to be able to shoot game  on their way, and this would provide them food in addition to the  concentrated supply they carried.  Small tents, in sections, were  carried, there being two, one for Tom and Ned and one for Mr. Damon and  the professor.    As far as could be learned from a casual inspection, Jacinto and his  deserting Indians had taken back with them only a small quantity of  food.  They were traveling light and down stream, and could reach the  town much more quickly than they had come away from it.    \"That Beecher certainly was slick,\" commented Professor Bumper when  they were ready to start.  \"He must have known about what time I would  arrive, and he had Jacinto waiting for us.  I thought it was too good  to be true, to get an experienced guide like him so easily.  But it was  all planned, and I was so engrossed in thinking of the ancient  treasures I hope to find that I never thought of a possible trick.  Well, let's start!\" and he led the way into the jungle, carrying his  heavy pack as lightly as did Tom.    Professor Bumper had a general idea in which direction lay a number of  native villages, and it was determined to head for them, blazing a path  through the wilderness, so that the Indians could follow it back to the  goods left behind.    It was with rather heavy hearts that the party set off, but Tom's  spirits could not long stay clouded, and the scientist was so  good-natured about the affair and seemed so eager to do the utmost to  render Beecher's trick void, that the others fell into a lighter mood,  and went on more cheerfully, though the way was rough and the packs  heavy.    They stopped at noon under a bower they made of palms, and, spreading  the nets over them, got a little rest after a lunch.  Then, when the  sun was less hot, they started off again.    \"Forward is the word!\" cried Ned cheerfully.  \"Forward!\"'    They had not gone more than an hour on the second stage of their tramp  when Tom, who was in the lead, following the direction laid out by the  compass, suddenly stopped, and reached around for his electric rifle,  which he was carrying at his back.    \"What is it?\" asked Ned in a whisper.    \"I don't know, but it's some big animal there in the bushes,\" was Tom's  low-voiced answer.  \"I'm ready for it.\"    The rustling increased, and a form could be seen indistinctly.  Tom  aimed the deadly gun and stood ready to pull the trigger.    Ned, who had a side view into the underbrush, gave a sudden cry.    \"Don't shoot, Tom!\" he yelled.  \"It's a man!\"          CHAPTER XIV    A NEW GUIDE      In spite of Ned Newton's cry, Tom's finger pressed the switch-trigger  of the electric rifle, for previous experience had taught him that it  was sometimes the best thing to awe the natives in out-of-the-way  corners of the earth.  But the young inventor quickly elevated the  muzzle, and the deadly missile went hissing through the air over the  head of a native Indian who, at that moment, stepped from the bush.    The man, startled and alarmed, shrank back and was about to run into  the jungle whence he had emerged.  Small wonder if he had, considering  the reception he so unwittingly met with.  But Tom, aware of the  necessity for making inquiries of one who knew that part of the jungle,  quickly called to him.    \"Hold on!\" he shouted.  \"Wait a minute.  I didn't mean that.  I thought  at first you were a tapir or a tiger.  No harm intended.  I say,  Professor,\" Tom called back to the savant, \"you'd better speak to him  in his lingo, I can't manage it.  He may be useful in guiding us to  that Indian village Jacinto told us of.\"    This Professor Bumper did, being able to make himself understood in the  queer part-Spanish dialect used by the native Hondurians, though he  could not, of course, speak it as fluently as had Jacinto.    Professor Bumper had made only a few remarks to the man who had so  unexpectedly appeared out of the jungle when the scientist gave an  exclamation of surprise at some of the answers made.    \"Bless my moving picture!\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"What's the matter now?  Is anything wrong?  Does he refuse to help us?\"    \"No, it isn't that,\" was the answer.  \"In fact he came here to help us.  Tom, this is the brother of the Indian who fell overboard and who was  eaten by the alligators.  He says you were very kind to try to save his  brother with your rifle, and for that reason he has come back to help  us.\"    \"Come back?\" queried Tom.    \"Yes, he went off with the rest of the Indians when Jacinto deserted  us, but he could not stand being a traitor, after you had tried to save  his brother's life.  These Indians are queer people.  They don't show  much emotion, but they have deep feelings.  This one says he will  devote himself to your service from now on.  I believe we can count on  him.  He is deeply grateful to you, Tom.\"    \"I'm glad of that for all our sakes.  But what does he say about  Jacinto?\"    The professor asked some more questions, receiving answers, and then  translated them.    \"This Indian, whose name is Tolpec, says Jacinto is a fraud,\" exclaimed  Professor Bumper.  \"He made all the Indians leave us in the night,  though many of them were willing to stay and fill the contract they had  made.  But Jacinto would not let them, making them desert.  Tolpec went  away with the others, but because of what Tom had done he planned to  come back at the first chance and be our guide.  Accordingly he jumped  ashore from one of the canoes, and made his way to our camp.  He got  there, found it deserted and followed us, coming up just now.\"    \"Well I'm glad I didn't frighten him off with my gun,\" remarked Tom  grimly.  \"So he agrees with us that Jacinto is a scoundrel, does he?  I  guess he might as well classify Professor Beecher in the same way.\"    \"I am not quite so sure of that,\" said Professor Bumper slowly.  \"I can  not believe Beecher would play such a trick as this, though some  over-zealous friend of his might.\"    \"Oh, of course Beecher did it!\" cried Tom.  \"He heard we were coming  here, figured out that we'd start ahead of him, and he wanted to  side-track us.  Well, he did it all right,\" and Tom's voice was bitter.    \"He has only side-tracked us for a while,\" announced Professor Bumper  in cheerful tones.    \"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"I mean that this Indian comes just in the nick of time.  He is well  acquainted with this part of the jungle, having lived here all his  life, and he offers to guide us to a place where we can get mules to  transport ourselves and our baggage to Copan.\"    \"Fine!\" cried Ned.  \"When can we start?\"    Once more the professor and the native conversed in the strange tongue,  and then Professor Bumper announced:    \"He says it will be better for us to go back where we left our things  and camp there.  He will stay with us to-night and in the morning go on  to the nearest Indian town and come back with porters and helpers.\"    \"I think that is good advice to follow,\" put in Tom, \"for we do need  our goods; and if we reached the settlement ourselves, we would have to  send back for our things, with the uncertainty of getting them all.\""]]]
