Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house,  and eaten up the Little, Small, Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look  about them. Now the little old Woman had not put the hard cushion  straight when she rose from the chair of the Great, Huge Bear.    \"Somebody has been sitting in my chair!\"    said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.    And the little old Woman had squatted down the soft cushion of the  Middle Bear.    \"Somebody has been sitting in my chair!\"    said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.    And you know what the little old Woman had done to the third chair.    \"Somebody has been sitting in my chair and has sate the bottom out of  it!\"    said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.    Then the Three Bears thought it necessary that they should make farther  search; so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now the little old  Woman had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge Bear, out of its place.    \"Somebody has been lying in my bed!\"    said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.    And the little old Woman had pulled the bolster of the Middle Bear out  of its place.    \"Somebody has been lying in my bed!\"    said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.    And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was  the bolster in its place; and the pillow in its place upon the bolster;  and upon the pillow was the little old Woman's ugly, dirty head,--which  was not in its place, for she had no business there.    \"Somebody has been lying in my bed,--and here she is!\"    said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.    The little old Woman had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff  voice of the Great, Huge Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was  no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And  she had heard the middle voice, of the Middle Bear, but it was only as  if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the  little, small, wee voice of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, it was so  sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started; and  when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself  out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window was open,  because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened  their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning. Out the little  old Woman jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall; or ran  into the wood and was lost there; or found her way out of the wood, and  was taken up by the constable and sent to the House of Correction for  a vagrant as she was, I cannot tell. But the Three Bears never saw  anything more of her.          JACK THE GIANT-KILLER    When good King Arthur reigned, there lived near the Land's End of  England, in the county of Cornwall, a farmer who had one only son called  Jack. He was brisk and of a ready lively wit, so that nobody or nothing  could worst him.    In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge giant named  Cormoran. He was eighteen feet in height, and about three yards round  the waist, of a fierce and grim countenance, the terror of all the  neighbouring towns and villages. He lived in a cave in the midst of the  Mount, and whenever he wanted food he would wade over to the main-land,  where he would furnish himself with whatever came in his way. Everybody  at his approach ran out of their houses, while he seized on their  cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-dozen oxen on his back at a  time; and as for their sheep and hogs, he would tie them round his waist  like a bunch of tallow-dips. He had done this for many years, so that  all Cornwall was in despair.    One day Jack happened to be at the town-hall when the magistrates were  sitting in council about the Giant. He asked: \"What reward will be given  to the man who kills Cormoran?\" \"The giant's treasure,\" they said, \"will  be the reward.\" Quoth Jack: \"Then let me undertake it.\"    So he got a horn, shovel, and pickaxe, and went over to the Mount in the  beginning of a dark winter's evening, when he fell to work, and before  morning had dug a pit twenty-two feet deep, and nearly as broad,  covering it over with long sticks and straw. Then he strewed a little  mould over it, so that it appeared like plain ground. Jack then placed  himself on the opposite side of the pit, farthest from the giant's  lodging, and, just at the break of day, he put the horn to his mouth,  and blew, Tantivy, Tantivy. This noise roused the giant, who rushed  from his cave, crying: \"You incorrigible villain, are you come here  to disturb my rest? You shall pay dearly for this. Satisfaction I will  have, and this it shall be, I will take you whole and broil you for  breakfast.\" He had no sooner uttered this, than he tumbled into the pit,  and made the very foundations of the Mount to shake. \"Oh, Giant,\" quoth  Jack, \"where are you now? Oh, faith, you are gotten now into Lob's  Pound, where I will surely plague you for your threatening words: what  do you think now of broiling me for your breakfast? Will no other diet  serve you but poor Jack?\" Then having tantalised the giant for a while,  he gave him a most weighty knock with his pickaxe on the very crown of  his head, and killed him on the spot.    Jack then filled up the pit with earth, and went to search the cave,  which he found contained much treasure. When the magistrates heard of  this they made a declaration he should henceforth be termed    JACK THE GIANT-KILLER    and presented him with a sword and a belt, on which were written these  words embroidered in letters of gold:      \"Here's the right valiant Cornish man,    Who slew the giant Cormoran.\"    The news of Jack's victory soon spread over all the West of England,  so that another giant, named Blunderbore, hearing of it, vowed to be  revenged on Jack, if ever he should light on him. This giant was the  lord of an enchanted castle situated in the midst of a lonesome wood.  Now Jack, about four months afterwards, walking near this wood in his  journey to Wales, being weary, seated himself near a pleasant fountain  and fell fast asleep. While he was sleeping, the giant, coming there  for water, discovered him, and knew him to be the far-famed Jack the  Giant-killer by the lines written on the belt. Without ado, he took Jack  on his shoulders and carried him towards his castle. Now, as they passed  through a thicket, the rustling of the boughs awakened Jack, who was  strangely surprised to find himself in the clutches of the giant. His  terror was only begun, for, on entering the castle, he saw the ground  strewed with human bones, and the giant told him his own would ere  long be among them. After this the giant locked poor Jack in an immense  chamber, leaving him there while he went to fetch another giant, his  brother, living in the same wood, who might share in the meal on Jack.    After waiting some time Jack, on going to the window beheld afar off the  two giants coming towards the castle. \"Now,\" quoth Jack to himself, \"my  death or my deliverance is at hand.\" Now, there were strong cords in a  corner of the room in which Jack was, and two of these he took, and made  a strong noose at the end; and while the giants were unlocking the iron  gate of the castle he threw the ropes over each of their heads. Then  he drew the other ends across a beam, and pulled with all his might, so  that he throttled them. Then, when he saw they were black in the face,  he slid down the rope, and drawing his sword, slew them both. Then,  taking the giant's keys, and unlocking the rooms, he found three fair  ladies tied by the hair of their heads, almost starved to death. \"Sweet  ladies,\" quoth Jack, \"I have destroyed this monster and his brutish  brother, and obtained your liberties.\" This said he presented them with  the keys, and so proceeded on his journey to Wales.    Jack made the best of his way by travelling as fast as he could, but  lost his road, and was benighted, and could find any habitation until,  coming into a narrow valley, he found a large house, and in order to  get shelter took courage to knock at the gate. But what was his surprise  when there came forth a monstrous giant with two heads; yet he did not  appear so fiery as the others were, for he was a Welsh giant, and  what he did was by private and secret malice under the false show of  friendship. Jack, having told his condition to the giant, was shown into  a bedroom, where, in the dead of night, he heard his host in another  apartment muttering these words:      \"Though here you lodge with me this night,    You shall not see the morning light    My club shall dash your brains outright!\"    \"Say'st thou so,\" quoth Jack; \"that is like one of your Welsh tricks,  yet I hope to be cunning enough for you.\" Then, getting out of bed, he  laid a billet in the bed in his stead, and hid himself in a corner of  the room. At the dead time of the night in came the Welsh giant, who  struck several heavy blows on the bed with his club, thinking he had  broken every bone in Jack's skin. The next morning Jack, laughing in his  sleeve, gave him hearty thanks for his night's lodging. \"How have you  rested?\" quoth the giant; \"did you not feel anything in the night?\"  \"No,\" quoth Jack, \"nothing but a rat, which gave me two or three slaps  with her tail.\" With that, greatly wondering, the giant led Jack to  breakfast, bringing him a bowl containing four gallons of hasty pudding.  Being loth to let the giant think it too much for him, Jack put a large  leather bag under his loose coat, in such a way that he could convey the  pudding into it without its being perceived. Then, telling the giant he  would show him a trick, taking a knife, Jack ripped open the bag, and  out came all the hasty pudding.

The Hamyaritic seems to have approached nearer ot the purity of the  Syriac, than the dialect of any other tribe; for the Arabs acknowledge their  father Yarab to have been the first whose tongue deviated from the Syriac  (which was his mother tongue, and is almost generally acknowledged by the  Asiatics to be the most ancient) to the Arabic.  The dialect of the Koreish is  usually termed the pure Arabic, or, as the Korân, which is written in this  dialect, calls it, the perspicuous and clear Arabic; perhaps, says Dr. Pocock,  because Ismael, their father, brought the Arabic he had learned of the  Jorhamites nearer to the original Hebrew.  But the politeness and elegance of  the dialect of the Koreish, is rather to be attributed to their having the  custody of the Caaba, and dwelling in Mecca, the centre of Arabia, as well  more remote from intercourse with foreigners, who might corrupt their  language, as frequented by the Arabs from the country all around, not only on  a religious account, but also for the composing of their differences, from  whose discourse and verses they took whatever words or phrases they judged  more pure and elegant; by which means the beauties of the whole tongue became  transfused into this dialect.  The Arabians are full of the commendations of  their language, and not altogether without reason; for it claims the  preference of most others in many respects, as being very harmonious and  expressive, and withal so copious, that they say no man without inspiration  can be a perfect master of it in its utmost extent; and yet they tell us, at  the same time, that the greatest part of it has been lost; which will not be  thought strange, if we consider how late the art of writing was practised  among them.  For though it was known to Job,1 their countryman, and also the  Hamyarites (who used a perplexed character called al Mosnad, wherein the  letters were not distinctly separate, and which was neither publicly taught,  nor suffered to be used without permission first obtained) many centuries  before Mohammed, as appears from some ancient monuments, said to be remaining  in their character; yet the other Arabs, and those of Mecca in particular,  were, for many ages, perfectly ignorant of it, unless such of them as were  Jews or Christians:2 Morâmer Ebn Morra of Anbar, a city of Irâk, who lived not  many years before Mohammed, was the inventor of the Arabic character, which  Bashar the Kendian is said to have learned from those of Anbar, and to have  introduced at Mecca but a little while before the institution of Mohammedism.  These letters of Marâmer were different from the Hamyaritic; and though they  were very rude, being either the same with, or very much like the Cufic,3  which character is still found in inscriptions and some ancient books, yet  they were those which the Arabs used for many years, the Korân itself being at  first written therein; for the beautiful character they now use was first  formed from the Cufic by Ebn Moklah, Wazir (or Visir) to the Khalîfs al  Moktader, al Kâher, and al Râdi, who lived       1  Job xix. 23, 24.  2  See Prideaux's Life of Mahomet, p. 29, 30.   3  A specimen of the Cufic character may be seen in Sir J. Chardin's  Travels, vol. iii, p. 119.            about three hundred years after Mohammed, and was brought to great perfection  by Ali Ebn Bowâb,4 who flourished in the following century, and whose name is  yet famous among them on that account; yet, it is said, the person who  completed it, and reduced it to its present form, was Yakût al Mostásemi,  secretary to al Mostásem, the last of the Khalîfs of the family of Abbâs, for  which reason he was surnamed al Khattât, or the Scribe.     The accomplishments the Arabs valued themselves chiefly on, were, 1.  Eloquence, and a perfect skill in their own tongue; 2. Expertness in the use  of arms, and horsemanship; and 3. Hospitality.1  The first they exercised  themselves in, by composing of orations and poems.  Their orations were of two  sorts, metrical, or prosaic, the one being compared to pearls strung, and the  other to loose ones.  They endeavoured to excel in both, and whoever was able,  in an assembly, to persuade the people to a great enterprise, or dissuade them  from a dangerous one, or gave them other wholesome advice, was honoured with  the title of Khâteb, or orator, which is now given to the Mohammedan  preachers.  They pursued a method very different from that of the Greek and  Roman orators; their sentences being like loose gems, without connection, so  that this sort of composition struck the audience chiefly by the fulness of  the periods, the elegance of the expression, and the acuteness of the  proverbial sayings; and so persuaded were they of their excelling in this way,  that they would not allow any nation to understand the art of speaking in  public, except themselves and the Persians; which last were reckoned much  inferior in that respect to the Arabians.2  Poetry was in so great esteem  among them, that it was a great accomplishment, and a proof of ingenuous  extraction, to be able to express one's self in verse with ease and elegance,  on any extraordinary occurrence; and even in their common discourse they made  frequent applications to celebrated passages of their famous poets.  In their  poems were preserved the distinction of descents, the rights of tribes, the  memory of great actions, and the propriety of their language; for which  reasons an excellent poet reflected an honour on his tribe, so that as soon as  any one began to be admired for his performances of this kind in a tribe, the  other tribes sent publicly to congratulate them on the occasion, and  themselves made entertainments, at which the women assisted, dressed in their  nuptial ornaments, singing to the sound of timbrels the happiness of their  tribe, who had now one to protect their honour, to preserve their genealogies  and the purity of their language, and to transmit their actions to posterity;3  for this was all performed by their poems, to which they were solely obliged  for their knowledge and instructions, moral and economical, and to which they  had recourse, as to an oracle, in all doubts and differences.1  No wonder,  then, that a public congratulation was made on this account, which honour they  yet were so far from making cheap, that they never did it but on one of these  three occasions, which were reckoned great points of felicity, viz., on the  birth of a boy, the rise of a poet, and the       4  Ebn Khalicân.  Yet others attribute the honour of the invention of this  character to Ebn Moklah's brother, Abdallah al Hasan; and the perfecting of it  to Ebn Amîd al Kâteb, after it had been reduced to near the present form by  Abd'alhamîd.

To keep up an emulation among their poets,  the tribes had, once a year, a general assembly at Ocadh,2 a place famous on  this account, and where they kept a weekly mart or fair, which was held on our  Sunday.3  This annual meeting lasted a whole month, during which time they  employed themselves, not only in trading, but in repeating their poetical  compositions, contending an vieing with each other for the prize; whence the  place, it is said, took its name.4  The poems that were judged to excel, were  laid up in their kings' treasuries, as were the seven celebrated poems, thence  called al Moallakât, rather than from their being hung upon the Caaba, which  honour they also had by public order, being written on Egyptian silk, and inn  letters of gold; for which reason they had also the name of al Modhahabât, or  the golden verses.5     The fair and assembly at Ocadh were suppressed by Mohammed, in whose time,  and for some years after, poetry seems to have been in some degree neglected  by the Arabs, who were then employed in their conquests; which being  completed, and themselves at peace, not only this study was revived,6 but  almost all sorts of learning were encouraged and greatly improved by them.  This interruption, however, occasioned the loss of most of their ancient  pieces of poetry, which were then chiefly preserved in memory; the use of  writing being rare among them, in their time of ignorance.7  Though the Arabs  were so early acquainted with poetry, they did not at first use to write poems  of a just length, but only expressed themselves in verse occasionally; nor was  their prosody digested into rules, till some time after Mohammed;8 for this  was done, as it is said, by al Khalîl Ahmed al Farâhîdi, who lived in the  reign of the Khalîf Harûn al Rashîd.9     The exercise of arms and horsemanship they were in a manner obliged to  practise and encourage, by reason of the independence of their tribes, whose  frequent jarrings made wars almost continual; and they chiefly ended their  disputes in field battles, it being a usual saying among them that GOD had  bestowed four peculiar things on the Arabs-that their turbans should be to  them instead of diadems, their tents instead of walls and houses, their swords  instead of entrenchments, and their poems instead of written laws.1     Hospitality was so habitual to them, and so much esteemed, that the  examples of this kind among them exceed whatever can be produced from other  nations.  Hatem, of the tribe of Tay,2 and Hasn, of that of Fezârah,3 were  particularly famous on this account; and the contrary vice was so much in  contempt, that a certain poet upbraids the inhabitants of Waset, as with the  greatest reproach, that none of their men ad the heart to give, nor their  women to deny.4       2  Idem, Spec. p. 159.  3  Geogr.
