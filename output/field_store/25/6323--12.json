He was  confused by the sight of them and by the incisive words in which  Christina showed how he had both insulted her and had tried to shift  the blame upon Sentanelli.    Monaldeschi broke down completely. He fell at the queen's feet and wept  piteously, begging for pardon, only to be met by the cold answer:    \"You are my subject and a traitor to me. Marquis, you must prepare to  die!\"    Then she turned away and left the hall, in spite of the cries of  Monaldeschi, to whom she merely added the advice that he should make  his peace with God by confessing to Father Le Bel.    After she had gone the marquis fell into a torrent of self-exculpation  and cried for mercy. The three armed men drew near and urged him to  confess for the good of his soul. They seemed to have no malice against  him, but to feel that they must obey the orders given them. At the  frantic urging of the marquis their leader even went to the queen to  ask whether she would relent; but he returned shaking his head, and  said:    \"Marquis, you must die.\"    Father Le Bel undertook a like mission, but returned with the message  that there was no hope. So the marquis made his confession in French  and Latin, but even then he hoped; for he did not wait to receive  absolution, but begged still further for delay or pardon.    Then the three armed men approached, having drawn their swords. The  absolution was pronounced; and, following it, one of the guards slashed  the marquis across the forehead. He stumbled and fell forward, making  signs as if to ask that he might have his throat cut. But his throat  was partly protected by a coat of mail, so that three or four strokes  delivered there had slight effect. Finally, however, a long, narrow  sword was thrust into his side, after which the marquis made no sound.    Father Le Bel at once left the Galerie des Cerfs and went into the  queen's apartment, with the smell of blood in his nostrils. He found  her calm and ready to justify herself. Was she not still queen over all  who had voluntarily become members of her suite? This had been agreed  to in her act of abdication. Wherever she set her foot, there, over her  own, she was still a monarch, with full power to punish traitors at her  will. This power she had exercised, and with justice. What mattered it  that she was in France? She was queen as truly as Louis XIV. was king.    The story was not long in getting out, but the truth was not wholly  known until a much later day. It was said that Sentanelli had slapped  the marquis in a fit of jealousy, though some added that it was done  with the connivance of the queen. King Louis, the incarnation of  absolutism, knew the truth, but he was slow to act. He sympathized with  the theory of Christina's sovereignty. It was only after a time that  word was sent to Christina that she must leave Fontainebleau. She took  no notice of the order until it suited her convenience, and then she  went forth with all the honors of a reigning monarch.    This was the most striking episode in all the strange story of her  private life. When her cousin Charles, whom she had made king, died  without an heir she sought to recover her crown; but the estates of the  realm refused her claim, reduced her income, and imposed restraints  upon her power. She then sought the vacant throne of Poland; but the  Polish nobles, who desired a weak ruler for their own purposes, made  another choice. So at last she returned to Rome, where the Pope  received her with a splendid procession and granted her twelve thousand  crowns a year to make up for her lessened Swedish revenue.    From this time she lived a life which she made interesting by her  patronage of learning and exciting by her rather unseemly quarrels with  cardinals and even with the Pope. Her armed retinue marched through the  streets with drawn swords and gave open protection to criminals who had  taken refuge with her. She dared to criticize the pontiff, who merely  smiled and said:    \"She is a woman!\"    On the whole, the end of her life was pleasant. She was much admired  for her sagacity in politics. Her words were listened to at every court  in Europe. She annotated the classics, she made beautiful collections,  and she was regarded as a privileged person whose acts no one took  amiss. She died at fifty-three, and was buried in St. Peter's.    She was bred a man, she was almost a son to her great father; and yet,  instead of the sonorous epitaph that is inscribed beside her tomb,  perhaps a truer one would be the words of the vexed Pope:    \"E DONNA!\"          KING CHARLES II. AND NELL GWYN      One might classify the kings of England in many ways. John was  undoubtedly the most unpopular. The impetuous yet far-seeing Henry II.,  with the other two great warriors, Edward I. and Edward III., and  William of Orange, did most for the foundation and development of  England's constitutional law. Some monarchs, such as Edward II. and the  womanish Henry VI., have been contemptible. Hard-working, useful kings  have been Henry VII., the Georges, William IV., and especially the last  Edward.    If we consider those monarchs who have in some curious way touched the  popular fancy without reference to their virtues we must go back to  Richard of the Lion Heart, who saw but little of England, yet was the  best essentially English king, and to Henry V., gallant soldier and  conqueror of France. Even Henry VIII. had a warm place in the affection  of his countrymen, few of whom saw him near at hand, but most of whom  made him a sort of regal incarnation of John Bull--wrestling and  tilting and boxing, eating great joints of beef, and staying his thirst  with flagons of ale--a big, healthy, masterful animal, in fact, who  gratified the national love of splendor and stood up manfully in his  struggle with the Pope.    But if you look for something more than ordinary popularity--something  that belongs to sentiment and makes men willing to become martyrs for a  royal cause--we must find these among the Stuart kings. It is odd,  indeed, that even at this day there are Englishmen and Englishwomen who  believe their lawful sovereign to be a minor Bavarian princess in whose  veins there runs the Stuart blood. Prayers are said for her at English  shrines, and toasts are drunk to her in rare old wine.    Of course, to-day this cult of the Stuarts is nothing but a fad. No one  ever expects to see a Stuart on the English throne. But it is  significant of the deep strain of romance which the six Stuarts who  reigned in England have implanted in the English heart. The old  Jacobite ballads still have power to thrill. Queen Victoria herself  used to have the pipers file out before her at Balmoral to the  \"skirling\" of \"Bonnie Dundee,\" \"Over the Water to Charlie,\" and \"Wha'll  Be King but Charlie!\" It is a sentiment that has never died. Her late  majesty used to say that when she heard these tunes she became for the  moment a Jacobite; just as the Empress Eugenie at the height of her  power used pertly to remark that she herself was the only Legitimist  left in France.    It may be suggested that the Stuarts are still loved by many Englishmen  because they were unfortunate; yet this is hardly true, after all. Many  of them were fortunate enough. The first of them, King James, an absurd  creature, speaking broad Scotch, timid, foolishly fond of favorites,  and having none of the dignity of a monarch, lived out a lengthy reign.  The two royal women of the family--Anne and Mary--had no misfortunes of  a public nature. Charles II. reigned for more than a quarter of a  century, lapped in every kind of luxury, and died a king.    The first Charles was beheaded and afterward styled a \"saint\"; yet the  majority of the English people were against his arrogance, or else he  would have won his great struggle against Parliament. The second James  was not popular at all. Nevertheless, no sooner had he been expelled,  and been succeeded by a Dutchman gnawing asparagus and reeking of  cheeses, than there was already a Stuart legend. Even had there been no  pretenders to carry on the cult, the Stuarts would still have passed  into history as much loved by the people.    It only shows how very little in former days the people expected of a  regnant king. Many monarchs have had just a few popular traits, and  these have stood out brilliantly against the darkness of the background.    No one could have cared greatly for the first James, but Charles I. was  indeed a kingly personage when viewed afar. He was handsome, as a man,  fully equaling the French princess who became his wife. He had no  personal vices. He was brave, and good to look upon, and had a kingly  mien. Hence, although he sought to make his rule over England a  tyranny, there were many fine old cavaliers to ride afield for him when  he raised his standard, and who, when he died, mourned for him as a  \"martyr.\"    Many hardships they underwent while Cromwell ruled with his iron hand;  and when that iron hand was relaxed in death, and poor, feeble Richard  Cromwell slunk away to his country-seat, what wonder is it that young  Charles came back to England and caracoled through the streets of  London with a smile for every one and a happy laugh upon his lips? What  wonder is it that the cannon in the Tower thundered a loud welcome, and  that all over England, at one season or another, maypoles rose and  Christmas fires blazed? For Englishmen at heart are not only  monarchists, but they are lovers of good cheer and merrymaking and all  sorts of mirth.    Charles II. might well at first have seemed a worthier and wiser  successor to his splendid father. As a child, even, he had shown  himself to be no faint-hearted creature. When the great Civil War broke  out he had joined his father's army. It met with disaster at Edgehill,  and was finally shattered by the crushing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion. Vol 1-4, Complete (#13)"],[1,"detail. It may be summed up briefly here, because it is the testimony  of an eye-witness who knew Christina.    Christina, with the marquis and a large retinue, was at Fontainebleau in  November, 1657. A little after midnight, when all was still, the priest,  Father Le Bel, was aroused and ordered to go at once to the Galerie des  Cerfs, or Hall of Stags, in another part of the palace. When he asked  why, he was told:    \"It is by the order of her majesty the Swedish queen.\"    The priest, wondering, hurried on his garments. On reaching the gloomy  hall he saw the Marquis Monaldeschi, evidently in great agitation, and  at the end of the corridor the queen in somber robes. Beside the  queen, as if awaiting orders, stood three figures, who could with some  difficulty be made out as three soldiers of her guard.    The queen motioned to Father Le Bel and asked him for a packet which she  had given him for safe-keeping some little time before. He gave it to  her, and she opened it. In it were letters and other documents, which,  with a steely glance, she displayed to Monaldeschi. He was confused by  the sight of them and by the incisive words in which Christina showed  how he had both insulted her and had tried to shift the blame upon  Sentanelli.    Monaldeschi broke down completely. He fell at the queen's feet and wept  piteously, begging for pardon, only to be met by the cold answer:    \"You are my subject and a traitor to me. Marquis, you must prepare to  die!\"    Then she turned away and left the hall, in spite of the cries of  Monaldeschi, to whom she merely added the advice that he should make his  peace with God by confessing to Father Le Bel.
