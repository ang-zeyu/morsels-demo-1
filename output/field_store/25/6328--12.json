No one, we presume, will doubt the faithfulness of Paul to      the end. None will say that he did not keep the faith, that he did      not fight the good fight, that he did not preach and persuade to      the last. And what was he to receive? A crown of righteousness. And      what shall others receive who do not labor faithfully, and continue      to the end? We leave such to search out their own promises if any      they have; and if they have any they are welcome to them, on our      part, for the Lord says that every man is to receive according to      his works. Reflect for a moment, brethren, and enquire, whether      you would consider yourselves worthy a seat at the marriage feast      with Paul and others like him, if you had been unfaithful? Had you      not fought the good fight, and kept the faith, could you expect to      receive? Have you a promise of receiving a crown of righteousness      from the hand of the Lord, with the Church of the First Born? Here      then, we understand, that Paul rested his hope in Christ, because      he had kept the faith, and loved his appearing and from His hand      he had a promise of receiving a crown of righteousness. If the      Saints are not to reign, for what purpose are they crowned? In an      exhortation of the Lord to a certain church in Asia, which was      built up in the days of the Apostles, unto whom He communicated      His word on that occasion by His servant John, He says, \"Behold,      I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take      thy crown.\" And again, \"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit      with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with      my Father in His throne\" (see Rev. 3). And again, it is written,      \"Behold, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear      what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall      be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath      this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as He is pure\" (I John      3:2, 3). How is it that these old Apostles should say so much on      the subject of the coming of Christ? He certainly had once come;      but Paul says, To all who love His appearing, shall be given the      crown: and John says, When He shall appear, we shall be like Him;      for we shall see Him as He is. Can we mistake such language as      this? Do we not offer violence to our own good judgment when we      deny the second coming of the Messiah? When has He partaken of the      fruit of the vine new with His ancient Apostles in His Father's      kingdom, as He promised He would just before He was crucified? In      Paul's epistle to the {21} Philippians, (3:20, 21), he says: \"For      our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the      Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change our vile body, that      it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the      working whereby He is able even to subdue all things unto Himself.\"      We find another promise to individuals living in the church at      Sardis who had not defiled their garments: \"And they shall walk      with me in white: for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same      shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name      out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my      Father, and before His angels.\" John represents the sound which he      heard from heaven, as giving thanks and glory to God, saying that      the Lamb was worthy to take the book and to open its seals; because      He was slain, and had made them kings and priests unto God: and      they should reign on the earth (see Rev. 5). In the 20th chapter      we find a length of time specified, during which Satan is to be      confined in his own place, and the Saints reign in peace, all these      promises and blessings we find contained in the law of the Lord,      which the righteous are to enjoy; and we might enumerate many more      places where the same or similar promises are made to the faithful,      but we do not deem it of importance to rehearse them here, as this      epistle is now lengthy; and our brethren, no doubt, are familiar      with them all.        Most assuredly it is, however, that the ancients, though persecuted      and afflicted by men, obtained from God promises of such weight and      glory, that our hearts are often filled with gratitude that we are      even permitted to look upon them while we contemplate that there      is no respect of persons in His sight, and that in every nation,      he that feareth God and worketh righteousness, is acceptable with      Him. But from the few items previously quoted we can draw the      conclusion that there is to be a day when all will be judged of      their works, and rewarded according to the same; that those who      have kept the faith will be crowned with a crown of righteousness;      be clothed in white raiment; be admitted to the marriage feast; be      free from every affliction, and reign with Christ on the earth,      where, according to the ancient promise, they will partake of      the fruit of the vine new in the glorious kingdom with Him; at      least we find that such promises were made to the ancient Saints.      And though we cannot claim these promises which were made to the      ancients for they are not our property, merely because they were      made to the ancient Saints, yet if we are the children of the Most      High, and are called with the same calling with which they were      called, and embrace the same covenant that they embraced, and are      faithful to the testimony of our Lord as they were, we can approach      the Father in the name of Christ as they approached Him and for      ourselves obtain the same promises. These promises, when obtained,      if ever by {22} us, will not be because Peter, John, and the other      Apostles, with the churches at Sardis, Pergamos, Philadelphia,      and elsewhere, walked in the fear of God and had power and faith      to prevail and obtain them; but it will be because we, ourselves,      have faith and approach God in the name of His Son Jesus Christ,      even as they did; and when these promises are obtained, they will      be promises directly to us, or they will do us no good. They will      be communicated for our benefit, being our own property (through      the gift of God), earned by our own diligence in keeping His      commandments, and walking uprightly before Him. If not, to what end      serves the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, and why was it ever      communicated to us?        Previous to commencing this letter we designed giving you some      instruction upon the regulation of the Church; but that will be      given hereafter.        In our own country, surrounded with blessings innumerable, to which      thousands of our fellow men are strangers, enjoying unspeakable      benefits and inexpressible comforts, when once our situation is      compared with the ancient Saints, as followers of the Lamb of      God who has taken away our sins by His own blood, we are bound      to rejoice and give thanks to Him always. Since the organization      of the Church of Christ, or the Church of the Latter-day Saints,      on the 6th of April, 1830, we have had the satisfaction of      witnessing the spread of the truth into various parts of our land,      notwithstanding its enemies have exerted their unceasing diligence      to stop its course and prevent its progress; though evil and      designing men have combined to destroy the innocent, because their      own craft was in danger; and these have been assisted in raising      mobs and circulating falsehoods by a miserable set of apostates who      have for wicked and unbecoming conduct been expelled from the body      of which they were once members, yet the glorious Gospel in its      fullness is spreading and daily gaining converts; and our prayer to      God is, that it may continue, and numbers be added of such as shall      be eternally saved.        The Messiah's kingdom on earth is of that kind of government, that      there has always been numerous apostates, for the reason that it      admits of no sins unrepented of without excluding the individual      from its fellowship. Our Lord said, \"Strive to enter in at the      straight gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and      shall not be able.\" And again, many are called, but few are chosen.      Paul said to the elders of the {23} Church at Ephesus, after he      had labored three years with them, that he knew that some of their      own number would turn away from the faith, and seek to lead away      disciples after them. None, we presume, in this generation will      pretend that he has the experience of Paul in building up the      Church of Christ; and yet, after his departure from the Church at      Ephesus, many, even of the elders, turned away from the truth;      and what is almost always the case, sought to lead away disciples      after them. Strange as it may appear at first thought, yet it is      no less strange than true, that notwithstanding all the professed      determination to live godly, apostates after turning from the faith      of Christ, unless they have speedily repented, have sooner or      later fallen into the snares of the wicked one, and have been left      destitute of the Spirit of God, to manifest their wickedness in the      eyes of multitudes. From apostates the faithful have received the      severest persecutions. Judas was rebuked and immediately betrayed      his Lord into the hands of His enemies, because Satan entered into      him. There is a superior intelligence bestowed upon such as obeyed      the Gospel with full purpose of heart, which, if sinned against,      the apostate is left naked and destitute of the Spirit"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#13)"],[1,"ideas, which, though they do not  excite them in our minds, or anywise immediately affect us, as being  altogether passive and unperceivable to us, they are nevertheless to God,  by whom they art perceived, as it were so many occasions to remind Him  when and what ideas to imprint on our minds; that so things may go on in  a constant uniform manner.    71. In answer to this, I observe that, as the notion of Matter is here  stated, the question is no longer concerning the existence of a thing  distinct from Spirit and idea, from perceiving and being perceived; but  whether there are not certain ideas of I know not what sort, in the mind  of God which are so many marks or notes that direct Him how to produce  sensations in our minds in a constant and regular method--much after the  same manner as a musician is directed by the notes of music to produce  that harmonious train and composition of sound which is called a tune,  though they who hear the music do not perceive the notes, and may be  entirely ignorant of them. But, this notion of Matter seems too  extravagant to deserve a confutation. Besides, it is in effect no  objection against what we have advanced, viz. that there is no senseless  unperceived substance.    72. THE ORDER OF OUR PERCEPTIONS SHOWS THE GOODNESS OF GOD, BUT  AFFORDS NO PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER.--If we follow the light  of reason, we shall, from the constant uniform method of our  sensations, collect the goodness and wisdom of the Spirit who  excites them in our minds; but this is all that I can see reasonably  concluded from thence. To me, I say, it is evident that the being of a  spirit infinitely wise, good, and powerful is abundantly sufficient to  explain all the appearances of nature. But, as for inert, senseless  Matter, nothing that I perceive has any the least connexion with it, or  leads to the thoughts of it. And I would fain see any one explain any the  meanest phenomenon in nature by it, or show any manner of reason, though  in the lowest rank of probability, that he can have for its existence, or  even make any tolerable sense or meaning of that supposition. For, as to  its being an occasion, we have, I think, evidently shown that with regard  to us it is no occasion. It remains therefore that it must be, if at all,  the occasion to God of exciting ideas in us; and what this amounts to we  have just now seen.    73. It is worth while to reflect a little on the motives which induced  men to suppose the existence of material substance; that so having  observed the gradual ceasing and expiration of those motives or reasons,  we may proportionably withdraw the assent that was grounded on them.  First, therefore, it was thought that colour, figure, motion, and the  rest of the sensible qualities or accidents, did really exist without the  mind; and for this reason it seemed needful to suppose some unthinking  substratum or substance wherein they did exist, since they could not be  conceived to exist by themselves. Afterwards, in process of time, men  being convinced that colours, sounds, and the rest of the sensible,  secondary qualities had no existence without the mind, they stripped this  substratum or material substance of those qualities, leaving only the  primary ones, figure, motion, and suchlike, which they still conceived to  exist without the mind, and consequently to stand in need of a material  support. But, it having been shown that none even of these can possibly  exist otherwise than in a Spirit or Mind which perceives them it follows  that we have no longer any reason to suppose the being of Matter; nay,  that it is utterly impossible there should be any such thing, so long as  that word is taken to denote an unthinking substratum of qualities or  accidents wherein they exist without the mind.    74. But though it be allowed by the materialists themselves that Matter  was thought of only for the sake of supporting accidents, and, the reason  entirely ceasing, one might expect the mind should naturally, and without  any reluctance at all, quit the belief of what was solely grounded  thereon; yet the prejudice is riveted so deeply in our thoughts, that we  can scarce tell how to part with it, and are therefore inclined, since  the thing itself is indefensible, at least to retain the name, which we  apply to I know not what abstracted and indefinite notions of being, or  occasion, though without any show of reason, at least so far as I can  see. For, what is there on our part, or what do we perceive, amongst all  the ideas, sensations, notions which are imprinted on our minds, either  by sense or reflexion, from whence may be inferred the existence of an  inert, thoughtless, unperceived occasion? and, on the other hand, on the  part of an All-sufficient Spirit, what can there be that should make us  believe or even suspect He is directed by an inert occasion to excite  ideas in our minds?    75. ABSURDITY OF CONTENDING FOR THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER AS THE OCCASION  OF IDEAS.--It is a very extraordinary instance of the force of prejudice,  and much to be lamented, that the mind of man retains so great a fondness,  against all the evidence of reason, for a stupid thoughtless somewhat, by  the interposition whereof it would as it were screen itself from the  Providence of God, and remove it farther off from the affairs of the  world. But, though we do the utmost we can to secure the belief of  Matter, though, when reason forsakes us, we endeavour to support our  opinion on the bare possibility of the thing, and though we indulge  ourselves in the full scope of an imagination not regulated by reason to  make out that poor possibility, yet the upshot of all is, that there are  certain unknown Ideas in the mind of God; for this, if anything, is all  that I conceive to be meant by occasion with regard to God. And this at  the bottom is no longer contending for the thing, but for the name.    76. Whether therefore there are such Ideas in the mind of God, and  whether they may be called by the name Matter, I shall not dispute. But,  if you stick to the notion of an unthinking substance or support of  extension, motion, and other sensible qualities, then to me it is most  evidently impossible there should be any such thing, since it is a plain  repugnancy that those qualities should exist in or be supported by an  unperceiving substance.    77. THAT A SUBSTRATUM NOT PERCEIVED, MAY EXIST, UNIMPORTANT.--But,  say you, though it be granted that there is no thoughtless support  of extension and the other qualities or accidents which we perceive,  yet there may perhaps be some inert, unperceiving substance or  substratum of some other qualities, as incomprehensible to us as colours  are to a man born blind, because we have not a sense adapted to them.  But, if we had a new sense, we should possibly no more doubt of their  existence than a blind man made to see does of the existence of light and  colours. I answer, first, if what you mean by the word Matter be only the  unknown support of unknown qualities, it is no matter whether there is  such a thing or no, since it no way concerns us; and I do not see the  advantage there is in disputing about what we know not what, and we know  not why.    78. But, secondly, if we had a new sense it could only furnish us with  new ideas or sensations; and then we should have the same reason against  their existing in an unperceiving substance that has been already offered  with relation to figure, motion, colour and the like. Qualities, as has  been shown, are nothing else but sensations or ideas, which exist only in  a mind perceiving them; and this is true not only of the ideas we are  acquainted with at present, but likewise of all possible ideas  whatsoever.    79. But, you will insist, what if I have no reason to believe the  existence of Matter? what if I cannot assign any use to it or explain  anything by it, or even conceive what is meant by that word? yet still it  is no contradiction to say that Matter exists, and that this Matter is in  general a substance, or occasion of ideas; though indeed to go about to  unfold the meaning or adhere to any particular explication of those words  may be attended with great difficulties. I answer, when words are used  without a meaning, you may put them together as you please without danger  of running into a contradiction. You may say, for example, that twice two  is equal to seven, so long as you declare you do not take the words of  that proposition in their usual acceptation but for marks of you know not  what. And, by the same reason, you may say there is an inert thoughtless  substance without accidents which is the occasion of our ideas. And we  shall understand just as much by one proposition as the other.    80. In the last place, you will say, what if we give up the cause of  material Substance, and stand to it that Matter is an unknown  somewhat--neither substance nor accident, spirit nor idea, inert,  thoughtless, indivisible, immovable, unextended, existing in no place.  For, say you, whatever may be urged against substance or occasion, or any  other positive or relative notion of Matter, has no place at all, so  long as this negative definition of Matter is adhered to. I answer, you  may, if so it shall seem good, use the word \"Matter\" in the same sense as  other men use \"nothing,\" and so make those terms convertible in your  style. For, after all, this is what appears to me to be the result of  that definition, the parts whereof when I consider with attention, either  collectively or separate from each other, I do not find that there is any  kind of effect or impression made on my mind different from what is  excited by the term nothing.    81. You will reply, perhaps, that in the fore-said definition is included  what doth sufficiently distinguish it from nothing--the positive abstract  idea of quiddity, entity, or existence. I own, indeed, that those who  pretend to the"]]]
