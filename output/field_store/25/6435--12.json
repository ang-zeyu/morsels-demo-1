I always made it a point to withhold my entrance  until the lady was in the terrace; then I would stroll in alone, take  a seat alone, and show a desire to be alone.  They have a very clever  way of serving strawberries at the Carlton.  A vine, growing from ten  to twelve large luscious berries is brought on in a silver pot.  It is  the acme of luxury.  You pick the fresh berries from the vine on your  table, the Terrace supplies quantities of cream, and you pay half a  sovereign--$2.50--for a dish of strawberries.  One dish is enough for  the average customer.  Every afternoon I ordered five!    Day after day I consumed in strawberries two sovereigns and a  half--$12.50--of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerein's money.  Always tipping the girl a half sovereign which made my daily  strawberry bill come up to three sovereigns ($15).  For about ten days  I did this, always at the same time, always being careful to make my  entrance after the lady's party was seated, always ordering the same  number of portions, always giving the girl the same tip.  It wasn't  long before I began to be observed.  I soon saw that not only the  attendants but the patrons of the Terrace were becoming interested in  my foible.  One day as I passed I heard someone say:    \"Here comes the strawberry fiend.\"    I was satisfied.  I knew it would be easy now to effect an entrance to  the lady's set.  I had been marked as something out of the usual in  the restaurant which from three to four in the afternoon at that time  of the year is the most fashionable in London.  Now, a woman like my  lady does not flirt.  If you glance at her under favorable conditions,  such as my strawberry \"stunt\" had created for me, she will return the  glance.  You both half smile and do not look at each other again that  afternoon.  That is not flirting.  Splitting hairs, we shall call it  psychic interest.    I continued my strawberry festival and one day a manager of Carlton  Terrace told me that people were making inquiries about me.  Several  men had wanted to know who I was.  Under questioning, he told me that  one of the men was a member of the lady's set.  It was easy to put  together two and two.  Obviously the inquiry had been inspired by her.    Meanwhile I had sent several communications to the Grand Duke,  insisting that pressure be brought to bear upon his nephew and to keep  him away from London; not even permitting him under penalty of  stopping his allowance, to write the lady in the case until the Grand  Duke gave his permission.  By now, London had gradually filled and the  season was at its height.  I went the rounds of the theaters from  Drury Lane to the Empire, and I visited the clubs.  I found here men  whom I had met previously and presently I rounded up two or three  fellows with whom I had been fairly intimate at one time or another on  hunting expeditions and at continental watering-places.  I made them  introduce me to different sets.  Dexterous maneuvering obtained me  invitations to afternoon teas and at-homes in the same circle  frequented by my lady.    I was introduced to her at an afternoon reception.  She was a typical  outdoor Englishwoman.  Not particularly handsome, hut possessing to  the full the clearness of skin and eyes and strong virile health, that  is the hereditary lien of Albion's daughters.  Tall, willowy and  strong, of free and independent manners and habits, she was the direct  antithesis of the usual German woman.  I reasoned that this was  probably the reason of the young Duke's infatuation.    \"How do you do, you wild Colonial boy.  Still as fond of strawberries  as ever?\"    We both burst out laughing.    \"So your ladyship observed and classified my little maneuvers.\"    \"Of course,\" with a toss of her head.    Unforced and pleasant chatting followed.  I could more and more  understand the Grand Duke's infatuation; in fact, considered him quite  a \"deuced, lucky beggar.\"    From that day on I made it a point to be present whenever she attended  public places, such as the theater, concerts or restaurants.  Gradually and imperceptibly, by little services here and there, I won  her confidence.  There was an after-theater supper, in the Indian room  of the Windsor, and I was invited.  By this time people had come to  know something about me.  I was a globe-trotter, a man of leisure,  interested as a hobby in research work in medicine.  I discovered that  her affair with the young Grand Duke was a fairly open secret in her  set; also, that she was expecting him in London almost daily.  Gradually I hinted that I knew the young Grand Duke.  As I gained her  confidence further, I invented amorous affairs for him and hinted to  her about them.  In this way I finally managed to induce her to talk.  Subtly I instilled a vague resentment against him, which was  accentuated by his non-appearance in London society up to now.  His  Highness having been kept away by his Serene Uncle, the serene one  having been cautioned to do so by me.    Two months passed before I was invited to the lady's home in Mayfair  and by that time, partly because I pretended to know the young Grand  Duke, I was on a more intimate footing.  I had learned that she had  met him at a hunting party at the Earl of Crewes' shooting box in  Shropshire.  Later, she intimated that this was but their official  meeting and that their acquaintance actually dated from a mountain  trip she had taken to Switzerland, the universal playground of royalty  traveling _incog_.  I learned too that her heavy bridge gambling had  cost her a lot of money.    The information that the lady was in debt did not come easily.  To  obtain it, I had to work on her maid.  Whenever the occasion arose, I  made it my business to tip the maid liberally.  I contrived to do a  number of little things for her.  Knowing the lady to be out, I called  at the house one day and while pretending to be waiting for my  hostess, I put some leading questions to the maid.  I learned that her  mistress was pressed for money.  That was an opening worth working on.    Thereafter I contrived to be present whenever there was a bridge party  at the lady's.  They are pretty high gamblers, those English society  women, and I came to see that the lady was generally a heavy loser.  It was my good fortune for her to lose to me one night.  Now, it is  the custom at these gatherings not to hand over cash; instead, the  unlucky one pays with what corresponds to an \"on demand note.\"  I took  her note that night and with others--the whereabouts of which I  learned from the maid and which I indirectly purchased from the  holders--I took all these to a notorious money-lender and made a deal  with him.  He was to take the notes and press the lady for payment, of  course keeping my name out of it.  It is obvious that, trying as I was  to w in her confidence, I could not go myself and hold these  obligations over her head.  That same day the money-lender paid the  lady a call.  He paid her a good many other calls, harassing her,  threatening legal action and driving her until she was almost to a  state of nervous collapse.  Well-placed sympathies soon made her talk  and she burst out pettishly that she was in debt and that most of her  acquaintances were in debt--nothing unusual in that set.    This was an opportune chance to be of material benefit to the lady.  Seriously we talked over her affairs.  I found them pretty well  entangled.  We discussed the young Grand Duke.  I gradually persuaded  her that there was no hope of a legitimate marriage with the house of  Mecklenburg-Schwerein, but because of her association with the young  Grand Duke and the fact that she had been betrothed to him, it was  only right that the Duchy provide her with some means of assistance.  The ice was perilously thin, for the lady is a high-spirited woman of  ideals and I had to be careful to word my language so that it would  not appear as though she were blackmailing.  In justice to her, I  believe that if she had taken that view of it she would have dropped  the entire matter, and retired from society for the season rather than  go through with my plan.  Finally I said:    \" Have you any means by which you could compel the ducal house to make  adequate acknowledgments and redresses to you?\"    After a long hesitation, she jumped up, swept from the room and  returned presently with a handful of letters.  I saw on some of them  the Grand Duke's coat of arms.  The young fool had been careless  enough for that!  She shook the letters in a temper and cried:    \"I wonder what Franz's uncle would say to these?  Why, I could compel  him to marry me.\"    Here was the chance.  The iron--in this case my lady's tempe--was hot.  I suggested that we sit down and talk it over.  As an introductory  attack, to create the impression that I knew what I was talking about,  I hinted that I was connected with a leading family in Germany and  that I was in London _incog_.  I approached the situation from the  viewpoint that I was her friend, not a friend of the house of  Mecklenburg-Schwerein, but that, by knowing them and their ways, I  could be of great assistance to her.    \"It is regrettable,\" I consoled; \"but you have no chance for a  legitimate, even a morganatic alliance with the young Grand Duke.  I  consider their entire attitude toward you utterly unfair.  In view of  your understanding with him, you are most certainly entitled to  adequate recompense from his house.  If you went into court you could  obtain this on grounds of breach of promise, but I can understand your  feelings.  Such a step would only cast odium upon an old and noble  family such as yours.\"    That seemed to her liking.    \"But what can I do?\" she said.    \"In view of my friendship for you,\" I told her, \"I would consider it  an honor if you would permit me to act on your behalf.  I think I can "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6952"],[0,"By Pike and Dyke: a Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic (#13)"],[1,"of the burgomaster's best wine.  As Ned had eaten nothing since the afternoon, and it was now past  midnight, he was by no means sorry to partake of some refreshment.  When he had finished he was conducted to a comfortable little chamber  that had been prepared for him, and in spite of his anxiety about  his father it was not long before he fell asleep.    The sun was high before he awoke. He dressed himself quickly and  went downstairs, for he feared to go straight to his father's room  lest he might be sleeping.    \"You have slept well,\" the burgomaster's wife said with a smile;  \"and no wonder, after your fatigues. The surgeon has just gone,  and I was about to send up to wake you, for he told me to tell you  that your father had passed a good night, and that you can now see  him.\"    Ned ran upstairs, and turning the handle of the door very quietly  entered his father's room. Captain Martin was looking very pale,  but Ned thought that his face had not the drawn look that had marked  it the evening before.    \"How are you, my dear father?\"    \"I am going on well, Ned; at least so the doctors say. I feel I  shall be but a battered old hulk when I get about again; but your  mother will not mind that, I know.\"    \"And do the doctors still think that they must take the leg off?\"  Ned asked hesitatingly.    \"That was their opinion last night, Ned, and it was my opinion too;  and so the matter was done off hand, and there is an end of it.\"    \"Done offhand?\" Ned repeated. \"Do you mean\"--and he hesitated.    \"Do I mean that they have taken it off? Certainly I do, Ned. They  took it off last night while you were downstairs in the burgomaster's  parlour; but I thought it would be much better for you not to know  anything about it until this morning. Yes, my boy, thank God, it  is all over! I don't say that it wasn't pretty hard to bear; but  it had to be done, you know, and the sooner it was over the better.  There is nothing worse than lying thinking about a thing.\"    Ned was too affected to speak; but with tears streaming down his  cheeks, leant over and kissed his father. The news had come as a  shock to him, but it seemed to have lifted a weight from his mind.  The worst was over now; and although it was terrible to think that  his father had lost his leg, still this seemed a minor evil after  the fear that perhaps his life might be sacrificed. Knowing that his  father should not be excited, or even talk more than was absolutely  necessary, Ned stayed but a few minutes with him, and then hurried  off to the ship, where, however, he found that the news that the  captain's leg had been amputated, and that the doctors hoped that  he would go on well, had been known some hours before; as Peters  had come on shore with the first dawn of daylight for news, and  heard from the burgomaster's servant that the amputation had taken  place the evening before, and an hour later had learned from the  lips of the doctor who had been watching by the captain's bedside,  that he had passed a fairly good night, and might so far be considered  to be doing well.    \"What do you think we had better do, Master Ned? Of course it will  be for the captain to decide; but in these matters it is always  best to take counsel beforehand. For although it is, of course,  what he thinks in the matter will be done, still it may be that  we might direct his thoughts; and the less thinking he does in his  present state the better.\"    \"What do you mean as to what is to be done, Peters?\"    \"Well, your father is like to be here many weeks; indeed, if I said  many months I don't suppose it would be far from the truth. Things  never go on quite smooth. There are sure to be inflammations,  and fever keeps on coming and going; and if the doctor says three  months, like enough it is six.\"    \"Of course I shall stay here and nurse him, Peters.\"    \"Well, Master Ned, that will be one of the points for the captain  to settle. I do not suppose he will want the Good Venture to be  lying idle all the time he is laid up; and though I can sail the  ship, the trading business is altogether out of my line. You know  all the merchants he does business with, going ashore, as you most  always do with him; I doubt not that you could fill his place and  deal with them just the same as if he was here.\"    \"But I cannot leave him at present.\"    \"No, no, Master Ned; no one would think of it. Now, what I have  been turning over in my mind is, that the best thing for the captain  and for you and your good mother is that I should set sail in the  Venture without the loss of a day and fetch her over. If the wind  is reasonable, and we have good luck, we may be back in ten days  or so. By that time the captain may be well enough to think where  we had better go for a cargo, and what course had best be taken  about things in general.\"    \"I think that would certainly be the best plan, Peters; and I will  suggest it to my father at once. He is much more likely to go on  well if my mother is with him, and she would be worrying sadly at  home were she not by his side. Besides, it will be well for her  to have something to occupy her, for the news of what has befallen  her father and brothers will be a terrible blow to her. If I put  it in that way to him I doubt not that he will agree to the plan;  otherwise, he might fear to bring her out here in such troubled  times, for there is no saying when the Spaniards will gather their  army to recover the revolted cities, or against which they will  first make their attempts. I will go back at once, and if he be  awake I will tell him that you and I agree that it will be best  for you to sail without loss of an hour to fetch my mother over,  and that we can then put off talking about other matters until the  ship returns.\"    Ned at once went back to his father's bedroom. He found the captain  had just awoke from a short sleep.    \"Father, I do not want to trouble you to think at present, but will  tell you what Master Peters and I, who have been laying our heads  together, concluded is best to be done. You are likely to be laid  up here for some time, and it will be far the best plan for the  Good Venture to sail over and fetch mother to nurse you.\"    \"I shall get on well enough, Ned. They are kindly people here; and  regarding our fight with the Spaniards as a sign of our friendship  and goodwill towards them, they will do all in their power for me.\"    \"Yes, father, I hope, indeed, that you will go on well; and I am  sure that the good people here will do their best in all ways for  you, and of course I will nurse you to the best of my power, though,  indeed, this is new work for me; but it was not so much you as  mother that we were thinking of. It will be terrible for her when  the news comes that her father and brothers are all killed, and that  you are lying here sorely wounded. It will be well nigh enough to  drive her distraught. But if she were to come over here at once  she would, while busying about you, have less time to brood over  her griefs; and, indeed, I see not why she should be told what has  happened at Vordwyk until she is here with you, and you can break  it to her. It will come better from your lips, and for your sake  she will restrain her grief.\"    \"There is a great deal in what you say, Ned, and, indeed, I long  greatly to have her with me; but Holland is no place at present  to bring a woman to, and I suppose also that she would bring the  girls, for she could not well leave them in a house alone. There  are plenty of friends there who would be glad to take them in; but  that she could decide upon herself. However, as she is a native  here she will probably consider she may well run the same risks as  the rest of her countrywomen. They remain with their fathers and  husbands and endure what perils there may be, and she will see no  reason why she should not do the same.\"    \"What we propose is that the Venture should set sail at once and  fetch my mother over, and the girls, if she sees fit to bring them.  I shall of course stay here with you until the brig returns, and  by that time you will, I hope, be strong enough to talk over what  had best be done regarding the ship and business generally.\"    \"Well, have your way, Ned. At present I cannot think over things  and see what is best; so I will leave the matter in your hands, and  truly I should be glad indeed to have your mother here with me.\"    Well content to have obtained the permission Ned hurried from the  room.    \"Has the burgomaster returned?\" he asked when he reached the lower  storey.    \"He has just come in, and I was coming up to tell you that dinner  is served.\"    \"Is it eleven o'clock already?\" Ned exclaimed. \"I had no idea it  was so late.\" He entered the room and bowed to the burgomaster and  his wife.    \"Worshipful sir,\" he said, \"I have just obtained leave from my  father to send our ship off to London to fetch hither my mother to  come to nurse him. I trust that by the time she arrives he will be  able to be moved, and then they will take lodgings elsewhere, so  as not to trespass longer upon your great kindness and hospitality.\"    \"I think that it is well that your mother should come over,\" the  burgomaster said; \"for a man who has had the greater part of his  leg taken off cannot be expected to get round quickly. Besides,  after what you told us last night about the misfortune that has  befallen her family, it were best that she should be busied about  her husband, and so have little time to brood over the matter. As  to hospitality, it would be strange indeed if we should not do all  that we could for a brave man who has been injured in fighting our  common enemy. Send word to your mother that she will be as welcome  as he is, and that we shall be ready in all respects to arrange  whatever she may think most convenient and comfortable. And now  you had best sit down and have your meal with us. As soon as it is  over I"]]]
