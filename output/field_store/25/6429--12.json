She had acquiesced on the telephone in her Guru going to  tiffin with Lucia, but about the middle of her lunch, she had been  unable to resist the desire to know what was happening at The Hurst.  She could not bear the thought that Lucia and her Guru were together  now, and her own note, saying that it was uncertain whether the Guru  would come to the garden party or not filled her with the most uneasy  apprehensions. She would sooner have acquiesced in her Guru going to  fifty garden-parties, where all was public, and she could keep an eye  and a control on him, rather than that Lucia should have \"enticed him  in,\"--that was her phrase--like this to tiffin. The only consolation  was that her own lunch had been practically inedible, and Robert had  languished lamentably for the Guru to return, and save his stomach. She  had left him glowering over a little mud and water called coffee.  Robert, at any rate, would welcome the return of the Guru.    She waddled across the lawn to where this harmonious party was sitting,  and at that moment Lucia began to feel vindictive. The calm of victory  which had permeated her when she brought the Guru in to lunch, without  any bother at all, was troubled and broken up, and darling Daisy's  note, containing the outrageous falsity that the Guru would not  certainly accept an invitation which had never been permitted to reach  him at all, assumed a more sinister aspect. Clearly now Daisy had  intended to keep him to herself, a fact that she already suspected and  had made a hostile invasion.    \"Guru, dear, you naughty thing,\" said Mrs Quantock playfully, after the  usual salutations had passed, \"why did you not tell your Chela you  would not be home for tiffin?\"    The Guru had unwound his legs, and stood up.    \"But see, beloved lady,\" he said, \"how pleasant we all are! Take not  too much thought, when it is only white souls who are together.\"    Mrs Quantock patted his shoulder.    \"It is all good and kind Om,\" she said. \"I send out my message of love.  There!\"    It was necessary to descend from these high altitudes, and Lucia  proceeded to do so, as in a parachute that dropped swiftly at first,  and then floated in still air.    \"And we're making such a lovely plan, dear Daisy,\" she said. \"The Guru  is going to teach us all. Classes! Aren't you?\"    He held his hands up to his head, palms outwards, and closed his eyes.    \"I seem to feel call,\" he said. \"I am sent. Surely the Guides tell me  there is a sending of me. What you call classes? Yes? I teach: you  learn. We all learn.... I leave all to you. I will walk a little way  off to arbour, and meditate, and then when you have arranged, you will  tell Guru, who is your servant. Salaam! Om!\"    With the Guru in her own house, and with every intention to annex him,  it was no wonder that Lucia took the part of chairman in this meeting  that was to settle the details of the esoteric brotherhood that was to  be formed in Riseholme. Had not Mrs Quantock been actually present, Lucia  in revenge for her outrageous conduct about the garden-party invitation  would probably have left her out of the classes altogether, but with her  sitting firm and square in a basket chair, that creaked querulously as  she moved, she could not be completely ignored. But Lucia took the lead  throughout, and suggested straightaway that the smoking-parlour would be  the most convenient place to hold the classes in.    \"I should not think of invading your house, dear Daisy,\" she said, \"and  here is the smoking-parlour which no one ever sits in, so quiet and  peaceful. Yes. Shall we consider that settled, then?\"    She turned briskly to Mrs Quantock.    \"And now where shall the Guru stay?\" she said. \"It would be too bad,  dear Daisy, if we are all to profit by his classes, that you should  have all the trouble and expense of entertaining him, for in your sweet  little house he must be a great inconvenience, and I think you said  that your husband had given up his dressing room to him.\"    Mrs Quantock made a desperate effort to retain her property.    \"No inconvenience at all,\" she said, \"quite the contrary in fact, dear.  It is delightful having him, and Robert regards him as a most desirable  inmate.\"    Lucia pressed her hand feelingly.    \"You and your husband are too unselfish,\" she said. \"Often have I said,  'Daisy and Mr Robert are the most unselfish people I know.' Haven't I,  Georgie? But we can't permit you to be so crowded. Your only spare  room, you know, _and_ your husband's dressing room! Georgie, I  know you agree with me; we must not permit dear Daisy to be so  unselfish.\"    The bird-like eye produced its compelling effect on Georgie. So short a  time ago he had indulged in revolutionary ideas, and had contemplated  having the Guru and Olga Bracely to dinner, without even asking Lucia:  now the faint stirrings of revolt faded like snow in summer. He knew  quite well what Lucia's next proposition would be: he knew, too, that  he would agree to it.    \"No, that would never do,\" he said. \"It is simply trespassing on Mrs  Quantock's good-nature, if she is to board and lodge him, while he  teaches all of us. I wish I could take him in, but with Hermy and Ursy  coming tonight, I have as little room as Mrs Quantock.\"    \"He shall come here,\" said Lucia brightly, as if she had just that  moment thought of it. \"There are Hamlet and Othello vacant\"--all her  rooms were named after Shakespearian plays--\"and it will not be the  least inconvenient. Will it, Peppino? I shall really like having him  here. Shall we consider that settled, then?\"    Daisy made a perfectly futile effort to send forth a message of love to  all quarters of the compass. Bitterly she repented of having ever  mentioned her Guru to Lucia: it had never occurred to her that she  would annex him like this. While she was cudgelling her brains as to  how she could arrest this powerful offensive, Lucia went sublimely on.    \"Then there's the question of what we shall pay him,\" she said. \"Dear  Daisy tells us that he scarcely knows what money is, but I for one  could never dream of profiting by his wisdom, if I was to pay nothing  for it. The labourer is worthy of his hire, and so I suppose the  teacher is. What if we pay him five shillings each a lesson: that will  make a pound a lesson. Dear me! I shall be busy this August. Now how  many classes shall we ask him to give us? I should say six to begin  with, if everybody agrees. One every day for the next week except  Sunday. That is what you all wish? Yes? Then shall we consider that  settled?\"    Mrs Quantock, still impotently rebelling, resorted to the most dire  weapon in her armoury, namely, sarcasm.    \"Perhaps, darling Lucia,\" she said, \"it would be well to ask my Guru if  he has anything to say to your settlings. England is a free country  still, even if you happen to have come from India.\"    Lucia had a deadlier weapon than sarcasm, which was the apparent  unconsciousness of there having been any. For it is no use plunging a  dagger into your enemy's heart, if it produces no effect whatever on  him. She clapped her hands together, and gave her peal of silvery  laughter.    \"What a good idea!\" she said. \"Then you would like me to go and tell  him what we propose? Just as you like. I will trot away, shall I, and  see if he agrees. Don't think of stirring, dear Daisy, I know how you  feel the heat. Sit quiet in the shade. As you know, I am a real  salamander, the sun is never _troppo caldo_ for me.\"    She tripped off to where the Guru was sitting in that wonderful  position. She had read the article in the encyclopaedia about Yoga  right through again this morning, and had quite made up her mind, as  indeed her proceedings had just shown, that Yoga was, to put it  irreverently, to be her August stunt. He was still so deep in  meditation that he could only look dreamily in her direction as she  approached, but then with a long sigh he got up.    \"This is beautiful place,\" he said. \"It is full of sweet influences and  I have had high talk with Guides.\"    Lucia felt thrilled.    \"Ah, do tell me what they said to you,\" she exclaimed.    \"They told me to follow where I was led: they said they would settle  everything for me in wisdom and love.\"    This was most encouraging, for decidedly Lucia had been settling for  him, and the opinion of the Guides was thus a direct personal  testimonial. Any faint twitchings of conscience (they were of the very  faintest) that she had grabbed dear Daisy's property were once and for  ever quieted, and she proceeded confidently to unfold the settlements  of wisdom and love, which met with the Guru's entire approval. He shut  his eyes a moment and breathed deeply.    \"They give peace and blessing,\" he said. \"It is they who ordered that  it should be so. Om!\"    He seemed to sink into profound depths of meditation, and Lucia hurried  back to the group she had left.    \"It is all too wonderful,\" she said. \"The Guides have told him that  they were settling everything for him in wisdom and love,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6841"],[0,"Mosaics of Grecian History (#13)"],[1," though far distant, yet with constant pace    Follow Offence. Offence, robust of limb,    And treading firm the ground, outstrips them all,    And over all the earth before them runs,    Hurtful to man. They, following, heal the hurt.    Received respectfully when they approach,    They yield us aid and listen when we pray;    But if we slight, and with obdurate heart    Resist them, to Saturinian Jove they cry.    Against us, supplicating that Offence    May cleave to us for vengeance of the wrong.\"      --COWPER'S Trans.    In the Seventeenth Book, Men-e-la'us is represented going into  battle, \"supplicating, first, the sire of all\"--that is, Jupiter,  the king of the gods. In the Twenty-third Book, Antil'ochus  attributes the ill-success of Eu-me'lus in the chariot-race to  his neglect of prayer. He says,      \"He should have offered prayer; then had be not    Arrived, as now, the hindmost of us all.\"    Numerous other instances might be given, from the works of the  Grecian poets, of the supposed efficacy of prayer to the gods.    The views of the early Greeks respecting the dispensations of an  overruling Providence, as shown in their belief in retributive  justice, are especially prominent in some of the sublime choruses  of the Greek tragedians, and in the \"Works and Days\" of Hesiod.  For instance, AEschylus says,      The ruthless and oppressive power    May triumph for its little hour;        But soon, with all their vengeful train,            The sullen Furies rise,        Break his full force, and whirl him down    Thro' life's dark paths, unpitied and unknown.      --POTTER'S Trans.    The following extracts from Hesiod illustrate the certainty with  which Justice was believed to overtake and punish those who pervert  her ways, while the good are followed by blessings. They also  show that the crimes of one are often \"visited on all.\"      Earth's crooked judges--lo! the oath's dread god    Avenging runs, and tracks them where they trod.    Rough are the ways of Justice as the sea,    Dragged to and fro by men's corrupt decree;    Bribe-pampered men! whose hands, perverting, draw    The right aside, and warp the wrested law.      Though while Corruption on their sentence waits    They thrust pale Justice from their haughty gates,    Invisible their steps the Virgin treads,    And musters evil o'er their sinful heads.    She with the dark of air her form arrays,    And walks in awful grief the city ways:    Her wail is heard; her tear, upbraiding, falls    O'er their stained manners and devoted walls.      But they who never from the right have strayed--    Who as the citizen the stranger aid--    They and their cities flourish: genial peace    Dwells in their borders, and their youth increase;    Nor Jove, whose radiant eyes behold afar,    Hangs forth in heaven the signs of grievous war;    Nor scath, nor famine; on the righteous prey--    Peace crowns the night, and plenty cheers the day.    Rich are their mountain oaks: the topmost tree    The acorns fill, its trunk the hiving bee;    Their sheep with fleeces pant; their women's race    Reflect both parents in the infant face:    Still flourish they, nor tempt with ships the main;    The fruits of earth are poured from every plain.      But o'er the wicked race, to whom belong    The thought of evil and the deed of wrong,    Saturnian Jove, of wide-beholding eyes,    Bids the dark signs of retribution rise;    And oft the deeds of one destructive fall--    The crimes of one--are visited on all.    The god sends down his angry plagues from high--    Famine and pestilence--in heaps they die!    Again, in vengeance of his wrath, he falls    On their great hosts, and breaks their tottering walls;      Scatters their ships of war; and where the sea    Heaves high its mountain billows, there is he!      Ponder, O Judges! in your inmost thought    The retribution by his vengeance wrought.    Invisible, the gods are ever nigh,    Pass through the midst, and bend th' all-seeing eye.    The man who grinds the poor, who wrests the right,    Aweless of Heaven, stands naked to their sight:    For thrice ten thousand holy spirits rove    This breathing world, the delegates of Jove;    Guardians of man, their glance alike surveys    The upright judgments and the unrighteous ways.      A virgin pure is Justice, and her birth    August from him who rules the heavens and earth--    A creature glorious to the gods on high,    Whose mansion is yon everlasting sky.    Driven by despiteful wrong she takes her seat,    In lowly grief, at Jove's eternal feet.    There of the soul unjust her plaints ascend:    So rue the nations when their kings offend--    When, uttering wiles and brooding thoughts of ill,    They bend the laws, and wrest them to their will.    Oh! gorged with gold, ye kingly judges, hear!    Make straight your paths, your crooked judgments fear,    That the foul record may no more be seen--    Erased, forgot, as though it ne'er had been.      --Trans. by ELTON.      OATHS.    As in the beginning of the foregoing extract, so the poets  frequently refer to the oaths that were taken by those who entered  into important compacts, showing that then as now, and as in Old  Testament times, some overruling deity was invoked to witness  the agreement or promise, and punish its violation. Sometimes  the person touched the altar of the god by whom he swore, or the  blood that was shed in the ceremonial sacrifice, while some walked  through the fire to sanctify their oaths. When Abraham swore unto  the King of Sodom that he would not enrich himself with any of  the king's goods, he lifted up his hand to heaven, pointing to  the supposed residence of the Deity, as if calling on him to  witness the oath. When he requires his servant to take an oath  unto him he says, \"Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: and  I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and earth;\"  and Jacob requires the same ceremony from Joseph when the latter  promises to carry his father's bones up out of Egypt.    When the goddess Vesta swore an oath in the very presence of  Jupiter, as represented in Homer's hymn, she touched his head,  as the most fitting ceremonial.      Touching the head of AEgis-bearing Jove,    A mighty oath she swore, and hath fulfilled,    That she among the goddesses of heaven    Would still a virgin be.    We find a military oath described by AEschylus in the drama of  \"The Seven Chiefs against Thebes\":      O'er the hollow of a brazen shield    A bull they slew, and, touching with their hands    The sacrificial stream, they called aloud    On Mars, Eny'o, and blood-thirsty Fear,    And swore an oath or in the dust to lay    These walls, and give our people to the sword,    Or, perishing, to steep the land in blood!    That there was sometimes a fire ordeal to sanctify the oath, we  learn from the Antig'o-ne of SOPHOCLES. The Messenger who brought  tidings of the burial of Polyni'ces says,      \"Ready were we to grasp the burning steel,    To pass through fire, and by the gods to swear    The deed was none of ours, nor aught we knew    Of living man by whom 'twas planned or done.\"    In the Twelfth Book of VIRGIL'S AEne'id, when King Turnus enters  into a treaty with the Trojans, he touches the altars of his  gods and the flames, as part of the ceremony:      \"I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames,    And all these powers attest, and all their names,    Whatever chance befall on either side,    No term of time this union shall divide;    No force nor fortune shall my vows unbind,    To shake the steadfast tenor of my mind.\"    The ancient poets and orators denounce perjury in the strongest  terms, and speak of the offence as one of a most odious character.      THE FUTURE STATE.    The future state in which the Greeks believed was to some extent  one of rewards and punishments. The souls of most of the dead,  however, were supposed to descend to the realms of Ha'des, where  they remained, joyless phantoms, the mere shadows of their former  selves, destitute of mental vigor, and, like the spectres of the  North American Indians, pursuing, with dreamlike vacancy, the  empty images of their past occupations and enjoyments. So cheerless  is the twilight of the nether world that the ghost of Achilles  informs Ulysses that it would rather live the meanest hireling  on earth than be doomed to continue in the shades below, even  though as sovereign ruler there. Thus Achilles asks him--      \"How hast thou dared descend into the gloom    Of Hades, where the shadows of the dead,    Forms without intellect, alone reside?\"    And when Ulysses tries to console him by reminding him that he  was even there supreme over all his fellow-shades, he receives  this reply:      \"Renowned Ulysses! think not death a theme    Of consolation: I would rather live    The servile hind for hire, and eat the bread    Of some man scantily himself sustained,    Than sovereign empire hold o'er all the shades.\"      --Odyssey, by COWPER, B. XI.    But even in Hades a distinction is made between the good and the  bad, for there Ulysses finds Mi'nos, the early law-giver of Crete,  advanced to the position of judge over the assembled shades--  absolving the just, and condemning the guilty.      High on a throne, tremendous to behold,    Stern Minos waves a mace of burnished gold;    Around, ten thousand thousand spectres stand,    Through the wide dome of Dis, a trembling band;    Whilst, as they plead, the fatal lots he rolls,    Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.      --Odyssey, by POPE, B. XI.    The kinds of punishment inflicted here are, as might be expected,  wholly earthly in their nature, and may be regarded rather as  the reflection of human passions than as moral retributions by  the gods. Thus, Tan'talus, placed up to his chin in water, which  ever flowed away from his lips, was tormented with unquenchable  thirst, while the fruits hanging around him"]]]
