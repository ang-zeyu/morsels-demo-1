And then we wrapped tire tape over the holes to keep the  cotton in.  And we wrapped tire tape around the tires and rims to  hold the tires on the rims.    You may ask, \"Wasn't it hard to pedal?\"  Boy!  I'll say it was  hard to pedal.  But I didn't care.  I couldn't reach the pedals  anyway.  Someone had to push me on it.  But I didn't have to push  anyone because I was too little to push anyone.  And the old bike  landed in the junk pile before I was big enough to push any of  the smaller ones on it.    Frank was through with the old bike when he handed it down to us  smaller kids.  He had gotten himself a motorcycle.  I believe it  was an Excelsior by name, although I think it was by name only.  It turned out to be not so hot.    The next thing I knew Frank owned a Buick automobile.  I think he  bought it from Uncle Simpson Johnson.  It had a four cylinder  engine, a spare tire, and a top that would fold down for easier  going when facing the wind.  The top could be put up to keep off  the rain and sunshine.  It was the model which had the two  leather straps running from the front corners of the top down to  the frame on both sides of the radiator.    Another thing I remember from my youth has to do with crazy  sayings which mean nothing in fact.  Some of them are about as  scientific as a black cat causing bad luck if he crosses your  path.    Anyway, most of the parents in our neighborhood didn't want their  kids going out in the hot sun bareheaded.  They would tell the  kids, \"If you go out bareheaded, the old buzzards will puke on  your head.\"    One Sunday we were visiting Uncle Andrew's family.  At least ten  of us boys and girls started out into the pasture and someone  noticed that Lela, the youngest girl, didn't have her bonnet on.  The older ones told her the buzzards would puke on her head if  she didn't go back and get her bonnet.    About 55 years later, Lela told me that she had always had a kind  feeling toward me since that day because I was the only one of  the whole bunch who would wait for her.  All the others ran off  from us and left us to catch up as best we could.    When we threw a stick and it went end over end or round and round  sideways, that was just plain throwing a stick.  But if we  pointed one end forward and shoved the stick forward by a thrust  on the back end of it, our scientific name for that operation was  \"puking\" the stick.  And we might start one end of a stick  through a hole in a fence or over a fence and \"puke\" it through  or over in the same manner.    Another thing grown-ups told us kids was, \"If you want to see the  wind, you've got to suck the old sow.\"  Well, I wanted to be able  to see the wind, but that seemed a little far out, even to me.  And before I got around to qualifying, I learned that they were  fibbing to us about it.  You still couldn't see the wind.    Here's another one for you.  When we killed a snake, we kids  wondered why he wouldn't stop wiggling.  We could even cut his  head off and he would keep right on wiggling.  They told us a  snake wouldn't stop wiggling till sundown, unless you turn him  over and make him lie on his back, then he would stop wiggling.  Trouble was, we couldn't get him to lie on his back.  Even with  his head off, he would keep rolling back over on his stomach, as  long as he could wiggle.    On the Exum farm, our house was about a half-mile from Grandma's  two-story house.  One day Mama sent me to Grandma's.  I don't  remember what I went for, but I do remember that when I got  there, I couldn't find Grandma anywhere.  I went all through the  house looking for her.    I didn't find her but I found a full box of matches on one end of  her sewing machine, where she always kept them.  Now, everyone  knows that all little boys like to play with matches.  And since  I was one of those little boys, I, too, liked to play with  matches, especially since I knew I was not supposed to touch  them.    So, I got a handful and went outside.  As I went, I struck them  on the porch wall, on the porch posts, on the bricks along the  flower beds and on the front yard fence.  Soon I was out of  matches and had to go back for more.    I figured that if a little handful of matches was that much fun,  a big handful would be a lot more fun.  My second handful was  really full.    This time I went out in the sand outside the yard and stood up a  row of matches in the sand with their tops up and close enough  together that the breeze would blow the flame from match to  match.  Then I lighted the match on the up-wind end of the row.  It worked perfectly and it was fun watching the flame leap from  match to match all the way to the far end.    I reasoned that too many missing matches would cause grown-ups to  become curious and begin asking questions.  And since they knew  that I had gone to Grandma's that day, I would be the first one  they would question.  So I limited my match pleasure to three  handfuls and then went home.    I still don't know why I was sent to Grandma's that day, but I  remember I was glad I went.  I came back with a deep, dark secret  of my own and a pleasurable memory to add to my storehouse.    In our youth, if any of us kids complained of feeling a little  under the weather, we were given a \"scientific\" medical  examination at bed time.  We had to stick out our tongue for our  parents to look at.  If there was the least bit of white coating  on the tongue, it meant we must take a calomel tablet and go to  bed.    I'm not sure I am spelling \"calomel\" correctly because I failed  to find the word in my small dictionary.  And I sort of doubt  that our family doctor knew how to spell it.  But it's just as  well.  I have yet to find a doctor who can write so anyone can  read what he wrote anyway.    But anyhow, that was the science of medicine in our family--if  the tongue is coated, take a pretty little pink tablet and wash  it down with a glass of water.    I hated even the thought of taking one.  The slightest taste of  one gagged me.  To prevent vomiting in the kitchen, I would ask  Mama if I could go out on the porch and take mine.    Now, I knew I wasn't apt to vomit on the kitchen floor, but Mama  didn't know it.  Another thing she didn't know was that there was  a knothole in the porch floor, under which, as years went by, a  small mound of pink tablets grew into a large mound.    They never caught me putting the tablets through the hole because  it was always dark.  No one ever took calomel in the daytime,  unless he had nothing else to do but sit around and wait for a  call to the bathroom, which was way out back in the cold--always  cold.  Not one of us ever had a coated tongue in the summertime.    Mama would say, \"Hurry, now, it's cold out there.\"  I knew full  well it was cold out there.  But I wasn't about to take that  little pink tablet.  I was determined to go through ice or snow  or any other bad weather rather than have that little tablet go  through me.  It didn't take long for me to put a tablet through a  knothole, throw a glass of water out into the yard, and get back  into the warm kitchen.  I don't know how the other kids made out.  The knothole was my own secret which I shared with no one.    Looking back, I can easily see that I should have let the entire  family in on my secret.  They could have saved the cost of the  tablets as well as those miserable early morning trips to the  cold bathroom.  And as it turned out, the white coating on my  tongue disappeared during the night the same as theirs did.    I was about eight years old at the time--that is, at the time I  learned to use the knothole.  I enjoyed it until we moved away  from the Exum place.  By the time I was 12 or 14, I began to  understand the scripture where it reads, \"As a man thinketh, so  is he.\"  The scriptures proved to be true.  I thought I didn't  want to take the tablets, so I didn't.  I thought I would get  well, so I did.    Another verse reads, \"The Lord will provide.\"  We often overlook  the little things the Lord does for us, like putting knotholes in  the most convenient places.  Fifty years later, I learned that at  age eight I was a Christian Scientist.  They too, are a group of  people who do not believe in taking medicine.    Many years later, when I was 40 years old, a neighbor told me he  had fleas under his house and he wondered if I might know how to  get rid of them.  I told him, \"Try Calomel.  I used it when I was  a kid and we didn't have fleas under our house.\"    When I was quite a small boy, a number of us were hoeing cotton  one day.  We had stopped at the end of the rows to get a drink  and sharpen our hoes.  Playfully, Frank picked me up and  pretended he was going to throw me over the fence and out into  the county road.  Well, he swung me over the fence and stood me  on my feet down in some weeds.  And there between my feet was a  beautiful little pocket knife.    This seemed almost too good to be true.  I was the happiest  little boy in the whole wide world.  I guess every boy wants a  pocket knife, and I had one--all my very own.    The others all looked at the knife and wished they had one like  it.  Jokingly, Frank said the knife was half his because, if he  hadn't pitched me over the fence, I wouldn't have found it.  So,  a few days later, when he asked if he could borrow it, naturally,  I loaned it to him, not because I thought it was half his, but  because he was my brother and wanted to borrow it.    Frank was going to school at Hamlin at that time and when I  thought it was time for him to return my knife, he told me that a  boy in town had borrowed it and wouldn't give it back.  And that  was the end of my knife.    Now, did I hate Frank for what he had done?  Of course not.  I  was too young to hate.  Hurt, yes, but hate, never!  I still  loved Frank just as much as I ever did. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54331"],[0,"Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown (#13)"],[1,"Mormon Battalion, having been designated for  that purpose, and by this proceeding we were liberated from the little  tyrant Lieutenant Colonel A. J. Smith.    By order of Colonel Cooke, Captain James Brown of Company C took  command of all the sick that were unable to continue the journey to  California; also of most of the laundresses, and a few able-bodied  men, with directions to go north to Pueblo, and join Captain Higgins.  In order to determine who were not able to continue the march to  California, we were drawn up in line, and the officers and Dr.  Sanderson inspected the whole command. The doctor scrutinized every one  of us, and when he said a man was not able to go, his name was added to  Captain Brown's detachment, whether the man liked it or not; and when  the doctor said a man could make the trip, that settled the matter. The  operation was much like a cooper culling stave timber, or a butcher  separating the lean from the fat sheep.    My desire was very strong to continue the overland journey, and when  the doctor neared me, I braced up and tried to look brave and hardy.  To the doctor's inquiry, \"How do you feel?\" my answer was, \"First  rate.\" He looked at me suspiciously and said, \"You look d--d pale and  weak,\" then passed on, and I was greatly relieved at having gone safely  through the inspection.    In order No. 8, Colonel Cooke called the particular attention of the  company commanders to the necessity of reducing baggage as much as  possible; that means for transportation were very deficient; that the  road was almost impracticable, much of it being in deep sand, and  how soon we would have to abandon our wagons it was impossible to  ascertain; that skillets and ovens could not be taken, and but one  camp-kettle to each mess of ten men.    Colonel Cooke very properly and correctly pointed out that everything  seemed to conspire to discourage the extraordinary undertaking of  marching the battalion 1,100 miles, for the much greater part of the  way through an unknown wilderness, without road or trail, and with a  wagon train. He said the battalion was much worn by traveling on foot,  marching from Nauvoo, Illinois; their clothing was very scant, there  was no money to pay them, or clothing to issue; the mules were utterly  broken down; the quartermaster's department was out of funds and its  credit bad; animals were scarce, and those procured were inferior and  deteriorating every hour from the lack of forage. All this made it  necessary that such careful preparation as could be should be made in  advance.    It can be easily seen from this statement that the condition and  prospects of the battalion were not very encouraging; yet there  were very few of the men who had the least desire to retrace their  steps--they knew what they had passed through, but looking ahead they  tried to hope for the best, realizing, just as they had been told, that  the country through which they had to travel was an unknown region.    With the colonel's orders carried out, we got ready to move, and about  the 21st of October we left Santa Fe and traveled six or eight miles  to a stream called Agua Fria (cold water). Grass for animals was very  short, the nights were very cold, and our road was in heavy sand almost  from the start. Our advance was slow, for the best teams had been taken  for extra service or express duties in other departments. Besides,  there was added to our already overburdened animals the load of sacks,  packsaddles, lashing-ropes, etc., necessary in the event of being  compelled to abandon the wagons, so we would not be entirely without  means of transportation. There was also the burden of sheep pelts and  blankets to use under pack saddles, and as most of these were bought  second-hand, they were well stocked with the insects commonly called  \"greybacks.\"    In a short time we drew near to the mountains, and the weather became  colder. Having but one blanket each we began to use the pelts and  saddle-blankets to splice out our scanty store of bedding. Thus  we proceeded over sandy roads, through the towns and villages of  Spaniards, Indians and Greasers--the surroundings presented being of  such a sameness that the journey became very monotonous.    Soon after leaving Santa Fe our rations were reduced to one-third  the regular amount allowed by law to the soldier. A detail of men  was called as a substitute for mules, to move and to lighten the  loads of the ammunition wagons. Each soldier was required to carry  sixty-four rounds of cartridges that contained each a one-ounce ball,  three buck-shot, and powder enough to send them where they should be,  besides the heavy paper they were wrapped in, and extra flints for the  firelock--about two hundred ounces added to the already overburdened  soldier.    Now the soldier must wade the tributaries of the Rio Grande del Norte,  sometimes waist deep and more, and is not allowed even to take off his  shoes, or any of his wearing apparel. An officer, perched on his white  mule on some point or eminence overlooking the whole command, with a  hawk's eye for keen military experience, calls to this or that squad of  men, with a horrid oath, as if they were brutes; often he curses the  men until they long for a battle where perchance someone would remember  the tyrant with an ounce ball and three buckshot. And yet, if that  feeling were not quenched in the soldier's bosom it would not require  an engagement with the enemy to accomplish the deed. But, praise God,  that feeling quickly passed off as the men marched along, their clothes  wet, and their thick soled cowhide army shoes partly filled with  sand--the chafing and galling of the flesh without and the gnawing and  grinding of the stomach within defied the mind to dwell upon any one  subject for long at a time.    Is it any wonder that under these conditions fifty-five of our comrades  wore down and collapsed so they had to go on the sick list and it  became necessary for Lieutenant W. W. Willis to take command of that  number of invalid soldiers, and join Captains Higgins and Brown at  Pueblo? This company of sick and exhausted men left us, on their  return, about the 10th or 12th of November.    About this time, the quartermaster was ordered to leave the remaining  two heavy ox-wagons, while the company commanders were directed to  reduce their tent-poles two-thirds; that is, to cast away all the  upright poles and use muskets instead, and to put gores in the back  part of the tents so they could shelter nine men in place of six; we  were also to leave one-third of the campkettles.    Then came some sport in putting packs on a number of our mules and  worn-out oxen. Some of these, which did not look as though they could  travel a hundred miles further, when the crupper was put in place would  rear up, wheel around, and kick in a most amusing style; nor did they  cease until their strength failed them.    When this sport, if sport it may be called, was over we began to  realize in a small degree the gravity of our situation. Our guides  were \"at sea,\" so to speak. We were in an enemy's land, with not a  soul in camp who knew anything of the country. Men had been sent ahead  to hunt a route for us to travel, and every time, on their return,  they reported impassable barriers ahead--rough, high, steep mountains,  without springs of water or creeks, or sandy plains, and barren deserts  that it would be impossible to cross. In this dilemma we had to bear to  the south, along the river, in hopes of finding a pass to the west.    One night, while camped near the Rio Grande del Norte, we heard a great  noise as though a band of horses were crossing the river. This created  quite an alarm, as there had been rumors of Mexicans revolting. For a  short time it was thought it was Mexican cavalry crossing to attack  us by night, but on the colonel making inquiries of the guides it was  learned that the noise proceeded from beaver playing in the river.  After watching and listening for a time, all settled down, contented  that there was no enemy at hand.    On resuming our march next day, we passed through a grove of cottonwood  trees, and saw where many of them had been cut down by the beaver. Some  of the trees were two feet or more in diameter, had been cut off in  long sections, and a surprisingly large dam had been constructed by the  beaver across the river. This dam had caused to be formed a large pond,  in which the beaver congregated at certain seasons, for sport. Thus the  mystery of our midnight disturbance was solved to our satisfaction.    We passed along the sandy road to a large bend in the river, which  Colonel Cooke decided was the place where we would cross the stream. He  stationed himself on an abrupt point of rock, from which he could view  the whole proceeding. Men were detailed from each company to follow the  wagons through the river. In order to avoid a rocky ridge the stream  had to be crossed twice within quarter of a mile. There were very heavy  quicksands, and if the teams were allowed to stop one minute it was  doubtful whether they could start again; consequently the precaution of  having men close at hand was very important, though the average soldier  did not understand the real reason for forcing him into the water  without stripping off at least part of his raiment.    The crossing was made early in the day, and the water was very cold, as  I had ample evidence, being one of those detailed to attend the wagons.  Our comrades took our muskets over the point while we lifted at the  wagons. As the water was waist deep, when the men would stoop to lift  it would wet our clothing very nearly to the armpits; our shoes also  were filled with sand.    Wet and cold, almost chilled, we continued our march through deep  sands, pushing and pulling at the wagons till our clothing dried on our  bodies, our shoes became so dry and hard that walking was very painful  and difficult,"]]]
