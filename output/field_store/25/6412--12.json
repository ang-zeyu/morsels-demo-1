The greatest ladies thither came,       And plied in chariots daily,       Or pawned their jewels for a sum       To venture in the Alley.    The inordinate thirst of gain that had afflicted all ranks of society,  was not to be slaked even in the South Sea. Other schemes, of the most  extravagant kind, were started. The share-lists were speedily filled up,  and an enormous traffic carried on in shares, while, of course, every  means were resorted to, to raise them to an artificial value in the  market.    Contrary to all expectation, South Sea stock fell when the bill received  the Royal assent. On the 7th of April the shares were quoted at three  hundred and ten, and on the following day, at two hundred and ninety.  Already the directors had tasted the profits of their scheme, and it was  not likely that they should quietly allow the stock to find its natural  level, without an effort to raise it. Immediately their busy emissaries  were set to work. Every person interested in the success of the  project endeavoured to draw a knot of listeners around him, to whom he  expatiated on the treasures of the South American seas. Exchange Alley  was crowded with attentive groups. One rumour alone, asserted with the  utmost confidence, had an immediate effect upon the stock. It was said,  that Earl Stanhope had received overtures in France from the Spanish  Government to exchange Gibraltar and Port Mahon for some places on the  coast of Peru, for the security and enlargement of the trade in the  South Seas. Instead of one annual ship trading to those ports, and  allowing the King of Spain twenty-five per cent. out of the profits, the  Company might build and charter as many ships as they pleased, and pay  no per centage whatever to any foreign potentate.    Visions of ingots danced before their eyes, and stock rose rapidly.  On the 12th of April, five days after the bill had become law, the  directors opened their books for a subscription of a million, at the  rate of 300 pounds for every 100 pounds capital. Such was the concourse  of persons, of all ranks, that this first subscription was found to  amount to above two millions of original stock. It was to be paid at  five payments, of 60 pounds each for every 100 pounds. In a few days the  stock advanced to three hundred and forty, and the subscriptions were  sold for double the price of the first payment. To raise the stock still  higher, it was declared, in a general court of directors, on the 21st of  April, that the midsummer dividend should be ten per cent., and that  all subscriptions should be entitled to the same. These resolutions  answering the end designed, the directors, to improve the infatuation  of the monied men, opened their books for a second subscription of a  million, at four hundred per cent. Such was the frantic eagerness of  people of every class to speculate in these funds, that in the course  of a few hours no less than a million and a half was subscribed at that  rate.    In the mean time, innumerable joint-stock companies started up  everywhere. They soon received the name of Bubbles, the most appropriate  that imagination could devise. The populace are often most happy in the  nicknames they employ. None could be more apt than that of Bubbles. Some  of them lasted for a week, or a fortnight, and were no more heard of,  while others could not even live out that short span of existence.  Every evening produced new schemes, and every morning new projects. The  highest of the aristocracy were as eager in this hot pursuit of gain  as the most plodding jobber in Cornhill. The Prince of Wales became  governor of one company, and is said to have cleared 40,000 pounds by  his speculations. [Coxe's Walpole, Correspondence between Mr. Secretary  Craggs and Earl Stanhope.] The Duke of Bridgewater started a scheme  for the improvement of London and Westminster, and the Duke of Chandos  another. There were nearly a hundred different projects, each more  extravagant and deceptive than the other. To use the words of the  \"Political State,\" they were \"set on foot and promoted by crafty knaves,  then pursued by multitudes of covetous fools, and at last appeared to  be, in effect, what their vulgar appellation denoted them to be--bubbles  and mere cheats.\" It was computed that near one million and a half  sterling was won and lost by these unwarrantable practices, to the  impoverishment of many a fool, and the enriching of many a rogue.    Some of these schemes were plausible enough, and, had they been  undertaken at a time when the public mind was unexcited, might have  been pursued with advantage to all concerned. But they were established  merely with the view of raising the shares in the market. The projectors  took the first opportunity of a rise to sell out, and next morning  the scheme was at an end. Maitland, in his History of London, gravely  informs us, that one of the projects which received great encouragement,  was for the establishment of a company \"to make deal-boards out of  saw-dust.\" This is, no doubt, intended as a joke; but there is  abundance of evidence to show that dozens of schemes hardly a whir more  reasonable, lived their little day, ruining hundreds ere they fell.  One of them was for a wheel for perpetual motion--capital, one million;  another was \"for encouraging the breed of horses in England, and  improving of glebe and church lands, and repairing and rebuilding  parsonage and vicarage houses.\" Why the clergy, who were so mainly  interested in the latter clause, should have taken so much interest in  the first, is only to be explained on the supposition that the scheme  was projected by a knot of the foxhunting parsons, once so common in  England. The shares of this company were rapidly subscribed for. But the  most absurd and preposterous of all, and which showed, more completely  than any other, the utter madness of the people, was one, started by an  unknown adventurer, entitled \"company for carrying on an undertaking  of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.\" Were not the fact  stated by scores of credible witnesses, it would be impossible to  believe that any person could have been duped by such a project. The  man of genius who essayed this bold and successful inroad upon public  credulity, merely stated in his prospectus that the required capital was  half a million, in five thousand shares of 100 pounds each, deposit 2  pounds per share. Each subscriber, paying his deposit, would be entitled  to 100 pounds per annum per share. How this immense profit was to  be obtained, he did not condescend to inform them at that time, but  promised, that in a month full particulars should be duly announced,  and a call made for the remaining 98 pounds of the subscription. Next  morning, at nine o'clock, this great man opened an office in Cornhill.  Crowds of people beset his door, and when he shut up at three o'clock,  he found that no less than one thousand shares had been subscribed for,  and the deposits paid. He was thus, in five hours, the winner of 2,000  pounds. He was philosopher enough to be contented with his venture, and  set off the same evening for the Continent. He was never heard of again.    Well might Swift exclaim, comparing Change Alley to a gulf in the South  Sea,--         Subscribers here by thousands float,       And jostle one another down,       Each paddling in his leaky boat,       And here they fish for gold, and drown.         Now buried in the depths below,       Now mounted up to heaven again,       They reel and stagger to and fro,       At their wit's end, like drunken men         Meantime, secure on Garraway cliffs,       A savage race, by shipwrecks fed,       Lie waiting for the foundered skiffs,       And strip the bodies of the dead.    Another fraud that was very successful, was that of the \"Globe Permits,\"  as they were called. They were nothing more than square pieces of  playing cards, on which was the impression of a seal, in wax, bearing  the sign of the Globe Tavern, in the neighbourhood of Exchange Alley,  with the inscription of \"Sail Cloth Permits.\" The possessors enjoyed no  other advantage from them than permission to subscribe, at some future  time, to a new sail-cloth manufactory, projected by one who was then  known to be a man of fortune, but who was afterwards involved in the  peculation and punishment of the South Sea directors. These permits sold  for as much as sixty guineas in the Alley.    Persons of distinction, of both sexes, were deeply engaged in all these  bubbles, those of the male sex going to taverns and coffee-houses to  meet their brokers, and the ladies resorting for the same purpose to  the shops of milliners and haberdashers. But it did not follow that all  these people believed in the feasibility of the schemes to which they  subscribed; it was enough for their purpose that their shares would, by  stock-jobbing arts, be soon raised to a premium, when they got rid  of them with all expedition to the really credulous. So great was the  confusion of the crowd in the alley, that shares in the same bubble were  known to have been sold at the same instant ten per cent. higher at  one end of the alley than at the other. Sensible men beheld the  extraordinary infatuation of the people with sorrow and alarm. There  were some, both in and out of Parliament, who foresaw clearly the ruin  that was impending. Mr. Walpole did not cease his gloomy forebodings.  His fears were shared by all the thinking few, and impressed most  forcibly upon the government. On the 11th of June, the day the  Parliament rose, the King published a proclamation, declaring that  all these unlawful projects should be deemed public nuisances, and  prosecuted accordingly, and forbidding any "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6382"],[0,"Bat Wing (#13)"],[1," by the discovery of the bat  wing?\"    \"I no longer doubted,\" said Colonel Menendez, shrugging his shoulders.  \"How could I?\"    \"Quite so,\" murmured Harley, absently, and evidently pursuing some  private train of thought. \"And now, I take it that your suspicions, if  expressed in words would amount to this: During your last visit to Cuba  you (_a_) either killed some high priest of Voodoo, or (_b_) seriously  injured him? Assuming the first theory to be the correct one, your death  was determined upon by the sect over which he had formerly presided.  Assuming the second to be accurate, however, it is presumably the man  himself for whom we must look. Now, Colonel Menendez, kindly inform me  if you recall the name of this man?\"    \"I recall it very well,\" replied the Colonel. \"His name was M'kombo, and  he was a Benin negro.\"    \"Assuming that he is still alive, what, roughly, would his age be  to-day?\"    The Colonel seemed to meditate, pushing a box of long Martinique cigars  across the table in my direction.    \"He would be an old man,\" he pronounced. \"I, myself, am fifty-two, and I  should say that M'kombo if alive to-day would be nearer to seventy than  sixty.\"    \"Ah,\" murmured Harley, \"and did he speak English?\"    \"A few words, I believe.\"    Paul Harley fixed his gaze upon the dark, aquiline face.    \"In short,\" he said, \"do you really suspect that it was M'kombo whose  shadow you saw upon the lawn, who a month ago made a midnight entrance  into Cray's Folly, and who recently pinned a bat wing to the door?\"    Colonel Menendez seemed somewhat taken aback by this direct question. \"I  cannot believe it,\" he confessed.    \"Do you believe that this order or religion of Voodooism has any  existence outside those places where African negroes or descendents of  negroes are settled?\"    \"I should not have been prepared to believe it, Mr. Harley, prior to my  experiences in Washington and elsewhere.\"    \"Then you do believe that there are representatives of this cult to be  met with in Europe and America?\"    \"I should have been prepared to believe it possible in America, for in  America there are many negroes, but in England----\"    Again he shrugged his shoulders.    \"I would remind you,\" said Harley, quietly, \"that there are also quite a  number of negroes in England. If you seriously believe Voodoo to follow  negro migration, I can see no objection to assuming it to be a universal  cult.\"    \"Such an idea is incredible.\"    \"Yet by what other hypothesis,\" asked Harley, \"are we to cover the facts  of your own case as stated by yourself? Now,\" he consulted his pencilled  notes, \"there is another point. I gather that these African sorcerers  rely largely upon what I may term intimidation. In other words, they  claim the power of wishing an enemy to death.\"    He raised his eyes and stared grimly at the Colonel.    \"I should not like to suppose that a man of your courage and culture  could subscribe to such a belief.\"    \"I do not, sir,\" declared the Colonel, warmly. \"No Obeah man could ever  exercise his will upon _me!_\"    \"Yet, if I may say so,\" murmured Harley, \"your will to live seems to  have become somewhat weakened.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    Colonel Menendez stood up, his delicate nostrils dilated. He glared  angrily at Harley.    \"I mean that I perceive a certain resignation in your manner of which I  do not approve.\"    \"You do not _approve?_\" said Colonel Menendez, softly; and I thought  as he stood looking down upon my friend that I had rarely seen a more  formidable figure.    Paul Harley had roused him unaccountably, and knowing my friend for a  master of tact I knew also that this had been deliberate, although I  could not even dimly perceive his object.    \"I occupy the position of a specialist,\" Harley continued, \"and you  occupy that of my patient. Now, you cannot disguise from me that your  mental opposition to this danger which threatens has become slackened.  Allow me to remind you that the strongest defence is counter-attack.  You are angry, Colonel Menendez, but I would rather see you angry than  apathetic. To come to my last point. You spoke of a neighbour in terms  which led me to suppose that you suspected him of some association with  your enemies. May I ask for the name of this person?\"    Colonel Menendez sat down again, puffing furiously at his cigarette,  whilst beginning to roll another. He was much disturbed, was fighting to  regain mastery of himself.    \"I apologize from the bottom of my heart,\" he said, \"for a breach of  good behaviour which really was unforgivable. I was angry when I should  have been grateful. Much that you have said is true. Because it is true,  I despise myself.\"    He flashed a glance at Paul Harley.    \"Awake,\" he continued, \"I care for no man breathing, black or white; but  _asleep_\"--he shrugged his shoulders. \"It is in sleep that these dealers  in unclean things obtain their advantage.\"    \"You excite my curiosity,\" declared Harley.    \"Listen,\" Colonel Menendez bent forward, resting his elbows upon his  knees. Between the yellow fingers of his left hand he held the newly  completed cigarette whilst he continued to puff vigorously at the old  one. \"You recollect my speaking of the death of a certain native girl?\"    Paul Harley nodded.    \"The real cause of her death was never known, but I obtained evidence to  show that on the night after the wing of a bat had been attached to her  hut, she wandered out in her sleep and visited the Black Belt. Can you  doubt that someone was calling her?\"    \"Calling her?\"    \"Mr. Harley, she was obeying the call of M'kombo!\"    \"The _call_ of M'kombo? You refer to some kind of hypnotic suggestions?\"    \"I illustrate,\" replied the Colonel, \"to help to make clear something  which I have to tell you. On the night when last the moon was full--on  the night after someone had entered the house--I had retired early to  bed. Suddenly I awoke, feeling very cold. I awoke, I say, and where do  you suppose I found myself?\"    \"I am all anxiety to hear.\"    \"On the point of entering the Tudor garden--you call it Tudor  garden?--which is visible from the window of your room!\"    \"Most extraordinary,\" murmured Harley; \"and you were in your night  attire?\"    \"I was.\"    \"And what had awakened you?\"    \"An accident. I believe a lucky accident. I had cut my bare foot upon  the gravel and the pain awakened me.\"    \"You had no recollection of any dream which had prompted you to go down  into the garden?\"    \"None whatever.\"    \"Does your room face in that direction?\"    \"It does not. It faces the lake on the south of the house. I had  descended to a side door, unbarred it, and walked entirely around the  east wing before I awakened.\"    \"Your room faces the lake,\" murmured Harley.    \"Yes.\"    Their glances met, and in Paul Harley's expression there seemed to be a  challenge.    \"You have not yet told me,\" said he, \"the name of your neighbour.\"    Colonel Menendez lighted his new cigarette.    \"Mr. Harley,\" he confessed, \"I regret that I ever referred to this  suspicion of mine. Indeed it is hardly a suspicion, it is what I may  call a desperate doubt. Do you say that, a desperate doubt?\"    \"I think I follow you,\" said Harley.    \"The fact is this, I only know of one person within ten miles of Cray's  Folly who has ever visited Cuba.\"    \"Ah.\"    \"I have no other scrap of evidence to associate him I with my shadowy  enemy. This being so, you will pardon me if I ask you to forget that I  ever referred to his existence.\"    He spoke the words with a sort of lofty finality, and accompanied them  with a gesture of the hands which really left Harley no alternative but  to drop the subject.    Again their glances met, and it was patent to me that underlying all  this conversation was something beyond my ken. What it was that Harley  suspected I could not imagine, nor what it was that Colonel Menendez  desired to conceal; but tension was in the very air. The Spaniard was on  the defensive, and Paul Harley was puzzled, irritated.    It was a strange interview, and one which in the light of after events  I recognized to possess extraordinary significance. That sixth sense of  Harley's was awake, was prompting him, but to what extent he understood  its promptings at that hour I did not know, and have never known to  this day. Intuitively, I believe, as he sat there staring at Colonel  Menendez, he began to perceive the shadow within a shadow which was the  secret of Cray's Folly, which was the thing called Bat Wing, which was  the devilish force at that very hour alive and potent in our midst.          CHAPTER IX    OBEAH        This conversation in Colonel Menendez's study produced a very unpleasant  impression upon my mind. The atmosphere of Cray's Folly seemed to become  charged with unrest. Of Madame de Staemer and Miss Beverley I saw nothing  up to the time that I retired to dress. Having dressed I walked into  Harley's room, anxious to learn if he had formed any theory to account  for the singular business which had brought us to Surrey.    Harley had excused himself directly we had left the study, stating that  he wished to get to the village post-office in time to send a telegram  to London. Our host had suggested a messenger, but this, as well as the  offer of a car, Harley had declined, saying that the exercise would aid  reflection. Nevertheless, I was surprised to find his room empty, for I  could not imagine why the sending of a telegram should have detained him  so long.    Dusk was falling, and viewed from the open window the Tudor garden below  looked very beautiful, part of it lying in a sort of purplish shadow  and the rest being mystically lighted as though viewed through a golden  veil. To the whole picture a sort of magic quality was added by a speck  of high-light which rested upon the face of the old sun-dial.    I thought that here was a fit illustration for a fairy tale; then I  remembered the Colonel's account"]]]
