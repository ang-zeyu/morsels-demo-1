The former was a German, whose honest and intense hatred of  England was apparent in all his leading articles, while the life-dream  of the latter was to see the establishment of the Dutch Republican  United States of South Africa.    Branches of the Bond were formed in the Cape Colony, the Transvaal, and  the Orange Free State, and in 1882 the first Congress of the Bond was  held at Graaff Reinet. A very astute and profoundly able plotter was  already at work in the person of Mr. J. H. Hofmeyr, who had started \"The  Farmers' Protection Society\" with the expressed purpose of watching over  Dutch farmers, and stirring them up to take an interest in politics.  Hitherto the Dutch bucolic mind had lain fallow. It was now to be  cultivated in order that it might produce fruit at parliamentary  elections, and, as a more powerful means to that end, \"The Farmers'  Protection Society\" was amalgamated with the Bond in the year 1883. Mr.  J. H. Hofmeyr then assumed the reins of management, and, as a Member in  the House of Assembly for Stellenbosch, began to wield a power which at  last developed into that of a colonial Earl of Warwick, or king-maker.  Ministries were formed at his bidding, and cabinets accepted his  control.    Certainly Mr. Hofmeyr very wisely and astutely modified the ostensible  objects of the Bond, and he was helped to do so by the fact that the  Hollander party in the Government at Pretoria became stronger than the  Africanders. Indeed, the Rev. S. J. Du Toit, the founder of the Bond,  was worsted in the Transvaal by the men from the old country. But to  make up for this, their march in the Cape Colony was so triumphant that  the President of the Bond at the Paarl Congress in June 1900 was able to  glory in the fact that since 1884 the Cape Colony had been ruled under  responsible government almost exclusively by the aid of the Africander  Bond. In 1885 there were twenty-five Bond Members of Parliament who held  the balance of power, and there can be no doubt that Sir Thomas  Upington, Sir Gordon Sprigg, and Mr. Rhodes sought and accepted their  support.    When Mr. Rhodes became Prime Minister in 1890 he was in harmony with the  Bond, but certainly did not sympathise with its real object. Each party  masked its idea, and each party thought that it was successfully using  the other for its own objects. Objects diametrically opposite: Mr.  Rhodes desired the supremacy of the British Imperial Power, and the  Africander party really aimed at the formation of a Republican South  Africa.    The Bond, says Mr. Theo. Schreiner (\"The Africander Bond,\" &c., p. 29)  was for many years the only organised political body in the Cape Colony,  and it exercised a political tyranny which crushed all true political  life and thought under its iron heel. While it deliberately refused to  take the reins of Government, it constantly aimed at increasing the  number of its Members in Parliament, and at making it impossible for any  Ministry to exist without its support. Arguing apparently from facts,  Sir Hercules Robinson, in his farewell speech at Cape Town in April  1889, went so far as to say that there was no longer any permanent place  in South Africa for direct Imperial rule.    A Bond Congress was held at Kimberley in 1891, when Mr. Rhodes made a  very bold but unsuccessful attempt to get the Dutch to join with the  English of the Cape Colony against the iniquitous rule and anti-British  policy of the South African Republic. Another Congress was held at Port  Elizabeth, when there was an attempt made to capture the Bond by means  of British friendship. Indeed the changed attitude of this Association  deceived many people, as under the extremely able leadership of Mr.  Hofmeyr it assumed the position of a great benevolent society, which  desired all Colonists, both English and Dutch, to join it, in order to  help forward the progress of South Africa. Nevertheless, it is very  significant that the Rev. S. J. du Toit lost the high position he had  previously held in consequence of his supposed anti-Transvaal  sympathies, and at the same time the influence of the South African  Republic greatly increased. \"Blood is thicker than water.\" The close  alliance of sympathy more and more knit together the Dutchmen of the  States and of the Colonies.    But the Jameson Raid of 1895 removed every estrangement. Just before  this event President Kruger showed his hand by venturing on a dangerous  step, which really meant an open breach of the Convention. He closed the  drifts, or fords, by which goods carried on the Cape and Natal railways  entered the Transvaal, intending by this act to force traffic over his  own Delagoa Bay line. He was informed by a joint ultimatum from the  Imperial Government and the Cape Colony that his action could not be  permitted, and he rescinded his declaration.    It is not necessary to give a history of the Jameson Raid. No event  since Majuba had so much played into the hands of the party in favour of  an \"Africander Natie.\" Cromwell's words when General Leslie's army left  its strong position, \"The Lord has delivered them into our hands,\"  clearly expressed the sentiment which on this occasion animated the  minds of Bond members. The Transvaal enormously increased its armaments,  preparations for war virtually commenced, and the entire sympathy of the  Africander party in the Cape Colony went out to their brethren of the  South African Republic.    Mr. Hofmeyr was a leader who thoroughly deserved the title of \"the  mole,\" as he metaphorically burrowed under the political platform, and  concealed his methods and aims with great subtlety. He saw the danger of  pursuing openly the programme expressed in the motto of his party, and  clothed the ideas of Africanderism in a constitutional garb. However,  when considering the real aim of the Bond, we shall prove that this  association never abandoned its original programme.    It must be admitted that, in some respects, there is an analogy between  Daniel O'Connell, as leader of the Irish National party, and J. H.  Hofmeyr, the \"Ons Jan\" of Africanderism. Both ostensibly were in favour  of working only on constitutional lines, and both were defeated by  extremists, who saw no other way of obtaining success than by recourse  to arms. In the case of the Young Ireland party, with such leaders as  John Michell, Smith O'Brien, and Gavan Duffy, a very futile insurrection  was quickly crushed; while, so far as J. H. Hofmeyr was concerned, a  much greater conflagration resulted. The great fire was really lit by  him--at least he constantly added fuel to it--and when too late made  futile efforts to extinguish the flames. O'Connell was much more honest,  as he openly opposed the Young Irelanders, and retired broken-hearted  from the arena.    Hofmeyr undoubtedly did not raise a finger to stop the furious onward  march of his party. _Ons Land_ indeed encouraged this movement, and the  editor, Mr. Malun, was completely under the great leader's influence.  Certainly at the end, as will be seen if the correspondence ever comes  to light, Hofmeyr tried to stop the mad career of the Republics. No one  saw more clearly than he did that it was absolute folly to fight the  British nation, but his interference came too late.    O'Connell fought more straightforwardly. Never for a moment did he admit  that the policy of force was justifiable; while, on the contrary,  Hofmeyr had not the moral courage to step publicly into the arena and  denounce it. He was always occult in his mode of fighting.  Unfortunately, in posing as a friend, he became the most dangerous enemy  of his own people.    The policy of the Africander Bond in the Cape Colony pandered to mean  interests and base prejudices. The corn farmers and brandy producers  were banded together in an unholy compact. Heavy duties of five  shillings per hundred pounds on flour and half-a-crown on wheat were  levied, while excise was abolished on spirits made from the grape, in  order that members of the Bond who grew cereals and made very bad brandy  might be benefited. The shameful result was that bread became dear and  bad alcohol cheap. As a Nemesis the producers got into the hands of  middlemen, and their condition was rather injured than improved. In the  case of both wines and spirits, careless, unscientific methods were  generally adopted, quantity was preferred to quality, and in many cases  acetous fermentation resulted. Although spirit produced from the grape  paid not a farthing of excise, and was carried at a non-paying rate on  the railways, it was so miserably full of fusel oil and dangerous in  character as to be discarded generally by the white population, and sent  broadcast among the aboriginal natives for their degradation,  demoralisation, and destruction. In a shameful manner Mr. Hofmeyr and  the Bond politicians persistently resisted every proposed law for the  restriction of the sale of bad alcohol among aboriginal natives, and  indeed by insidious methods did all in their power to remove every  barrier between the native and the deadly poison made carelessly in  thousands of \"pot stills\" in the Dutch districts of the Western  Province.    At the same time the true Phariseeism of this people was demonstrated by  their fanatical observance of the Lord's Day, which they styled the  Sabbath, and their absurd opposition to any Sunday trains, even when  absolutely necessary in general public interests. Mr. Merriman, in one  of his saner moments, reprobated this hypocrisy.    [Illustration: Photo: Maull & Fox, London.    SIR H. J.

I knew I'd find you somewhere--sometime. I  haven't slept two winks since leaving Montreal! And I guess I really  frightened that big man with the terrible mustaches, for when I rushed  in on him tonight, dripping wet, and said, 'I'm Miss Mary Josephine  Conniston, and I want my brother,' his eyes grew bigger and bigger  until I thought they were surely going to pop out at me. And then he  swore. He said, 'My Gawd, I didn't know he had a sister!'\"    Keith's heart was choking him. So this wonderful little creature was  Derwent Conniston's sister! And she was claiming him. She thought he  was her brother!    \"--And I love him because he treated me so nicely,\" she was saying. \"He  really hugged me, Derry. I guess he didn't think I was away past  eighteen. And he wrapped me up in a big oilskin, and we came up here.  And--O Derry, Derry--why did you do it? Why didn't you let me know?  Don't you--want me here?\"    He heard, but his mind had swept beyond her to the little cabin in the  edge of the Great Barren where Derwent Conniston lay dead. He heard the  wind moaning, as it had moaned that night the Englishman died, and he  saw again that last and unspoken yearning in Conniston's eyes. And he  knew now why Conniston's face had followed him through the gray gloom  and why he had felt the mysterious presence of him long after he had  gone. Something that was Conniston entered into him now. In the  throbbing chaos of his brain a voice was whispering, \"She is yours, she  is yours.\"    His arms tightened about her, and a voice that was not unlike John  Keith's voice said: \"Yes, I want you! I want you!\"          X      For a space Keith did not raise his head. The girl's arms were about  him close, and he could feel the warm pressure of her cheek against his  hair. The realization of his crime was already weighing his soul like a  piece of lead, yet out of that soul had come the cry, \"I want you--I  want you!\" and it still beat with the voice of that immeasurable  yearning even as his lips grew tight and he saw himself the monstrous  fraud he was. This strange little, wonderful creature had come to him  from out of a dead world, and her lips, and her arms, and the soft  caress of her hands had sent his own world reeling about his head so  swiftly that he had been drawn into a maelstrom to which he could find  no bottom. Before McDowell she had claimed him. And before McDowell he  had accepted her. He had lived the great lie as he had strengthened  himself to live it, but success was no longer a triumph. There rushed  into his brain like a consuming flame the desire to confess the truth,  to tell this girl whose arms were about him that he was not Derwent  Conniston, her brother, but John Keith, the murderer. Something drove  it back, something that was still more potent, more demanding, the  overwhelming urge of that fighting force in every man which calls for  self-preservation.    Slowly he drew himself away from her, knowing that for this night at  least his back was to the wall. She was smiling at him from out of the  big chair, and in spite of himself he smiled back at her.    \"I must send you to bed now, Mary Josephine, and tomorrow we will talk  everything over,\" he said. \"You're so tired you're ready to fall asleep  in a minute.\"    Tiny, puckery lines came into her pretty forehead. It was a trick he  loved at first sight.    \"Do you know, Derry, I almost believe you've changed a lot. You used to  call me 'Juddy.' But now that I'm grown up, I think I like Mary  Josephine better, though you oughtn't to be quite so stiff about it.  Derry, tell me honest--are you AFRAID of me?\"    \"Afraid of you!\"    \"Yes, because I'm grown up. Don't you like me as well as you did one,  two, three, seven years ago? If you did, you wouldn't tell me to go to  bed just a few minutes after you've seen me for the first time in all  those--those--Derry, I'm going to cry! I AM!\"    \"Don't,\" he pleaded. \"Please don't!\"    He felt like a hundred-horned bull in a very small china shop. Mary  Josephine herself saved the day for him by jumping suddenly from the  big chair, forcing him into it, and snuggling herself on his knees.    \"There!\" She looked at a tiny watch on her wrist. \"We're going to bed  in two hours. We've got a lot to talk about that won't wait until  tomorrow, Derry. You understand what I mean. I couldn't sleep until  you've told me. And you must tell me the truth. I'll love you just the  same, no matter what it is. Derry, Derry, WHY DID YOU DO IT?\"    \"Do what?\" he asked stupidly.    The delicious softness went out of the slim little body on his knees.  It grew rigid. He looked hopelessly into the fire, but he could feel  the burning inquiry in the girl's eyes. He sensed a swift change  passing through her. She seemed scarcely to breathe, and he knew that  his answer had been more than inadequate. It either confessed or  feigned an ignorance of something which it would have been impossible  for him to forget had he been Conniston. He looked up at her at last.  The joyous flush had gone out of her face. It was a little drawn. Her  hand, which had been snuggling his neck caressingly, slipped down from  his shoulder.    \"I guess--you'd rather I hadn't come, Derry,\" she said, fighting to  keep a break out of her voice. \"And I'll go back, if you want to send  me. But I've always dreamed of your promise, that some day you'd send  for me or come and get me, and I'd like to know WHY before you tell me  to go. Why have you hidden away from me all these years, leaving me  among those who you knew hated me as they hated you? Was it because you  didn't care? Or was it because--because--\" She bent her head and  whispered strangely, \"Was it because you were afraid?\"    \"Afraid?\" he repeated slowly, staring again into the fire. \"Afraid--\"  He was going to add \"Of what?\" but caught the words and held them back.    The birch fire leaped up with a sudden roar into the chimney, and from  the heart of the flame he caught again that strange and all-pervading  thrill, the sensation of Derwent Conniston's presence very near to him.  It seemed to him that for an instant he caught a flash of Conniston's  face, and somewhere within him was a whispering which was Conniston's  voice. He was possessed by a weird and masterful force that swept over  him and conquered him, a thing that was more than intuition and greater  than physical desire. It was inspiration. He knew that the Englishman  would have him play the game as he was about to play it now.    The girl was waiting for him to answer. Her lips had grown a little  more tense. His hesitation, the restraint in his welcome of her, and  his apparent desire to evade that mysterious something which seemed to  mean so much to her had brought a shining pain into her eyes. He had  seen such a look in the eyes of creatures physically hurt. He reached  out with his hands and brushed back the thick, soft hair from about her  face. His fingers buried themselves in the silken disarray, and he  looked for a moment straight into her eyes before he spoke.    \"Little girl, will you tell me the truth?\" he asked. \"Do I look like  the old Derwent Conniston, YOUR Derwent Conniston? Do I?\"    Her voice was small and troubled, yet the pain was slowly fading out of  her eyes as she felt the passionate embrace of his fingers in her hair.  \"No. You are changed.\"    \"Yes, I am changed. A part of Derwent Conniston died seven years ago.  That part of him was dead until he came through that door tonight and  saw you. And then it flickered back into life. It is returning slowly,  slowly. That which was dead is beginning to rouse itself, beginning to  remember. See, little Mary Josephine. It was this!\"    He drew a hand to his forehead and placed a finger on the scar. \"I got  that seven years ago. It killed a half of Derwent Conniston, the part  that should have lived. Do you understand? Until tonight--\"    Her eyes startled him, they were growing so big and dark and staring,  living fires of understanding and horror. It was hard for him to go on  with the lie. \"For many weeks I was dead,\" he struggled on. \"And when I  came to life physically, I had forgotten a great deal. I had my name,  my identity, but only ghastly dreams and visions of what had gone  before. I remembered you, but it was in a dream, a strange and haunting  dream that was with me always. It seems to me that for an age I have  been seeking for a face, a voice, something I loved above all else on  earth, something which was always near and yet was never found. It was  you, Mary Josephine, you!\"    Was it the real Derwent Conniston speaking now? He felt again that  overwhelming force from within which was not his own. The thing that  had begun as a lie struck him now as a thing that was truth. It was he,  John Keith, who had been questing and yearning and hoping. It was John  Keith, and not Conniston, who had returned into a world filled with a  desolation of loneliness, and it was to John Keith that a beneficent  God had sent this wonderful creature in an hour that was blackest in  its despair. He was not lying now. He was fighting. He was fighting to  keep for himself the one atom of humanity that meant more to him than  all the rest of the human race, fighting to keep a great love that had  come to him out of a world in which he no longer had a friend or a  home, and to that fight his soul went out as a drowning man grips at a  spar on a sea. As the girl's hands came to his face and he heard the  yearning, grief-filled cry of his name on her lips, he no longer sensed  the things he was saying, but held her close in his arms, kissing her  mouth, and her eyes, and her hair, and repeating over and over again  that now he had found her he would never give her up. Her arms clung to  him. They were like two children brought together after a long  separation, and Keith knew that Conniston's love for this girl who was  his sister must have been a"]]]
