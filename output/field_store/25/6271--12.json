It disappeared when I was transformed.  If I could find it I  could easily break these enchantments by means of my magic, and we  would resume our own forms again.  Will you help us search for the  Black Bag, Friend Cat?\"    \"Of course,\" replied the Glass Cat.  \"But I expect the strange Magician  carried it away with him.  If he's a magician, he knows you need that  Bag, and perhaps he's afraid of your magic.  So he's probably taken the  Bag with him, and you won't see it again unless you find the Magician.\"    \"That sounds reasonable,\" remarked the Lamb, which was Dorothy.  \"Those  pink brains of yours seem to be working pretty well to-day.\"    \"If the Glass Cat is right,\" said the Wizard in a solemn voice,  \"there's more trouble ahead of us.  That Magician is dangerous, and if  we go near him he may transform us into shapes not as nice as these.\"    \"I don't see how we could be any WORSE off,\" growled Gugu, who was  indignant because he was forced to appear in the form of a fat woman.    \"Anyway,\" said the Cowardly Lion, \"our best plan is to find the  Magician and try to get the Black Bag from him.  We may manage to steal  it, or perhaps we can argue him into giving it to us.\"    \"Why not find the Goose, first?\" asked Dorothy.  \"The Goose will be  angry at the Magician, and he may be able to help us.\"    \"That isn't a bad idea,\" returned the Wizard.  \"Come on, Friends; let's  find that Goose.  We will separate and search in different directions,  and the first to find the Goose must bring him here, where we will all  meet again in an hour.\"          14.  The Wizard Learns the Magic Word      Now, the Goose was the transformation of old Ruggedo, who was at one  time King of the Nomes, and he was even more angry at Kiki Aru than  were the others who shapes had been changed.  The Nome detested  anything in the way of a bird, because birds lay eggs and eggs are  feared by all the Nomes more than anything else in the world.  A goose  is a foolish bird, too, and Ruggedo was dreadfully ashamed of the shape  he was forced to wear.  And it would make him shudder to reflect that  the Goose might lay an egg!    So the Nome was afraid of himself and afraid of everything around him.  If an egg touched him he could then be destroyed, and almost any animal  he met in the forest might easily conquer him.  And that would be the  end of old Ruggedo the Nome.    Aside from these fears, however, he was filled with anger against Kiki,  whom he had meant to trap by cleverly stealing from him the Magic Word.  The boy must have been crazy to spoil everything the way he did, but  Ruggedo knew that the arrival of the Wizard had scared Kiki, and he was  not sorry the boy had transformed the Wizard and Dorothy and made them  helpless.  It was his own transformation that annoyed him and made him  indignant, so he ran about the forest hunting for Kiki, so that he  might get a better shape and coax the boy to follow his plans to  conquer the Land of Oz.    Kiki Aru hadn't gone very far away, for he had surprised himself as  well as the others by the quick transformations and was puzzled as to  what to do next.  Ruggedo the Nome was overbearing and tricky, and Kiki  knew he was not to be depended on; but the Nome could plan and plot,  which the Hyup boy was not wise enough to do, and so, when he looked  down through the branches of a tree and saw a Goose waddling along  below and heard it cry out, \"Kiki Aru!  Quack--quack!  Kiki Aru!\" the  boy answered in a low voice, \"Here I am,\" and swung himself down to the  lowest limb of the tree.    The Goose looked up and saw him.    \"You've bungled things in a dreadful way!\" exclaimed the Goose.  \"Why  did you do it?\"    \"Because I wanted to,\" answered Kiki.  \"You acted as if I was your  slave, and I wanted to show these forest people that I am more powerful  than you.\"    The Goose hissed softly, but Kiki did not hear that.    Old Ruggedo quickly recovered his wits and muttered to himself: \"This  boy is the goose, although it is I who wear the goose's shape.  I will  be gentle with him now, and fierce with him when I have him in my  power.\"  Then he said aloud to Kiki:    \"Well, hereafter I will be content to acknowledge you the master.  You  bungled things, as I said, but we can still conquer Oz.\"    \"How?\" asked the boy.    \"First give me back the shape of the Li-Mon-Eag, and then we can talk  together more conveniently,\" suggested the Nome.    \"Wait a moment, then,\" said Kiki, and climbed higher up the tree.  There he whispered the Magic Word and the Goose became a Li-Mon-Eag, as  he had been before.    \"Good!\" said the Nome, well pleased, as Kiki joined him by dropping  down from the tree.  \"Now let us find a quiet place where we can talk  without being overheard by the beasts.\"    So the two started away and crossed the forest until they came to a  place where the trees were not so tall nor so close together, and among  these scattered trees was another clearing, not so large as the first  one, where the meeting of the beasts had been held.  Standing on the  edge of this clearing and looking across it, they saw the trees on the  farther side full of monkeys, who were chattering together at a great  rate of the sights they had witnessed at the meeting.    The old Nome whispered to Kiki not to enter the clearing or allow the  monkeys to see them.    \"Why not?\" asked the boy, drawing back.    \"Because those monkeys are to be our army--the army which will conquer  Oz,\" said the Nome.  \"Sit down here with me, Kiki, and keep quiet, and  I will explain to you my plan.\"    Now, neither Kiki Aru nor Ruggedo had noticed that a sly Fox had  followed them all the way from the tree where the Goose had been  transformed to the Li-Mon-Eag.  Indeed, this Fox, who was none other  than the Wizard of Oz, had witnessed the transformation of the Goose  and now decided he would keep watch on the conspirators and see what  they would do next.    A Fox can move through a forest very softly, without making any noise,  and so the Wizard's enemies did not suspect his presence.  But when  they sat down by the edge of the clearing, to talk, with their backs  toward him, the Wizard did not know whether to risk being seen, by  creeping closer to hear what they said, or whether it would be better  for him to hide himself until they moved on again.    While he considered this question he discovered near him a great tree  which had a hollow trunk, and there was a round hole in this tree,  about three feet above the ground.  The Wizard Fox decided it would be  safer for him to hide inside the hollow tree, so he sprang into the  hole and crouched down in the hollow, so that his eyes just came to the  edge of the hole by which he had entered, and from here he watched the  forms of the two Li-Mon-Eags.    \"This is my plan,\" said the Nome to Kiki, speaking so low that the  Wizard could only hear the rumble of his voice.  \"Since you can  transform anything into any form you wish, we will transform these  monkeys into an army, and with that army we will conquer the Oz people.\"    \"The monkeys won't make much of an army,\" objected Kiki.    \"We need a great army, but not a numerous one,\" responded the Nome.  \"You will transform each monkey into a giant man, dressed in a fine  uniform and armed with a sharp sword.  There are fifty monkeys over  there and fifty giants would make as big an army as we need.\"    \"What will they do with the swords?\" asked Kiki.  \"Nothing can kill the  Oz people.\"    \"True,\" said Ruggedo.  \"The Oz people cannot be killed, but they can be  cut into small pieces, and while every piece will still be alive, we  can scatter the pieces around so that they will be quite helpless.  Therefore, the Oz people will be afraid of the swords of our army, and  we will conquer them with ease.\"    \"That seems like a good idea,\" replied the boy, approvingly.  \"And in  such a case, we need not bother with the other beasts of the forest.\"    \"No; you have frightened the beasts, and they would no longer consent  to assist us in conquering Oz.  But those monkeys are foolish  creatures, and once they are transformed to Giants, they will do just  as we say and obey our commands.  Can you transform them all at once?\"    \"No, I must take one at a time,\" said Kiki.  \"But the fifty  transformations can be made in an hour or so.  Stay here, Ruggedo, and  I will change the first monkey--that one at the left, on the end of the  limb--into a Giant with a sword.\"    \"Where are you going?\" asked the Nome.    \"I must not speak the Magic Word in the presence of another person,\"  declared Kiki, who was determined not to allow his treacherous  companion to learn his secret, \"so I will go where you cannot hear me.\"    Ruggedo the Nome was disappointed, but he hoped still to catch the boy  unawares and surprise the Magic Word.  So he merely nodded his lion  head, and Kiki got up and went back into the forest a short distance.  Here he spied a hollow tree, and by chance it was the same hollow tree  in which the Wizard of Oz, now in the form of a Fox, had hidden himself.    As Kiki ran up to the tree the Fox ducked its head, so that it was out  of sight in the dark hollow beneath the hole, and then Kiki put his  face into the hole and whispered: \"I want that monkey on the branch at  the left to become a Giant man fifty feet tall, dressed in a uniform  and with a sharp sword--Pyrzqxgl!\"    Then he ran back to Ruggedo, but the Wizard Fox had heard quite plainly  every word that he had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41934"],[0,"Idling in Italy: Studies of literature and of life (#13)"],[1,"of Bracco and the  Shavian imitations of Pirandello. In protest against all these they seek  the full liberty of the written word, as the evangel of socialism seeks  the liberty of the individual. Not from other writers but from reality  itself, or from the depths of their own imaginations, they have received  a vision and this vision they demand the right to evoke in others, by  what words or what images they will. The art of expression should be  speeded up, abbreviated, and epitomized, while the love of profound  essentials is cultivated. To borrow from England's singer of  materialistic grandeur and promise, they        \" ... want the world much more the world;      Men to men and women to women--all        Adventure, courage, instinct, passion, power.\"    And in addition, as true Futurists, they want us to have constantly in  mind what happened to Lot's wife when she looked back to see how high  the flames rose over Sodom and Gomorrah.    The leaders of the Futuristic movement in Italy were Guillaume  Apollinaire, then editor of _Les Soirees de Paris_, and F. T. Marinetti  of Milan.    One thing can be said of Signor Marinetti, the pope of Futurism, which  no one, I fancy, will deny. He is the most amusing writer in Italy. His  idea of beauty is a massive building of concrete in course of  construction with the scaffoldings lovingly embracing it. His idea of  ugliness is a curve of any kind--save in the feminine body. \"Parole in  liberta,\" words free from syntactical shackles are the words with which  we shall fight the battle of the future. They are the dynamite which  will blow asunder literary Monte Testaccio, in which are buried the  useless literary labors of his forebears but which shall also prepare  the soil for a fertility that it has never possessed. Dynamism is the  master-key. No artificer of the past or wizard of the future can  construct a lock that it will not readily open, and as for political  manacles they are as fragile as rubber bands when confronted with the  doctrines of his new book, \"Democrazia Futurista.\"    Signor Marinetti has no delusions of grandeur; he only pretends that he  has. Nor is he the victim of a mental disorder which is characterized by  loss of insight and megalomania. It is gratifying to be able to make  this diagnosis of one of Italy's literary leaders. It offsets the  diagnosis of general paresis made of Woodrow Wilson by one of Mr.  Marinetti's fellow citizens and published with such elaborate attempts  of substantiation in the _Giornale di Italia_. He merely overestimates  his intellectual and emotional possessions, but he says many clever  things and makes some prophecies that are likely to come through. The  last European ruler who talked and acted as Signor Marinetti does got a  bad spill, as is now fairly widely known. In reality, Marinetti is a  Bolshevik who amuses himself behind a mask, but not all the principles  of Bolshevism are bad by any means, nor even are they new. The most  telling way of making a statement is to overstate it. The most  successful way of getting a bad smell out of a house is to burn the  house; then, if you have a good plan and plenty of time, money, and  building material, you can construct yourself a house free from bad  odors. However, there are other ways of making it a very livable and  beautiful house, but why one should object to Mr. Marinetti's building  his own house his own way is difficult to understand, unless in so doing  it he makes himself such a nuisance to his neighbors that they cannot  tolerate him. So far he has not done that, but when he joins force with  Signor Bruno Corra, as he has in \"L'Isola dei Baci\" (\"The Island of  Kisses\"), he comes perilously near it.    Apollinaire, a Pole whose real name was Kostrowitski, was born in Rome  and lived in Italy until late childhood, when he went to France, where  he remained until his death in 1919. He had a tremendous influence upon  many of the young symbolist writers of Italy, comparable to that  exercised by Stephane Mallarme on the young writers in the '80's and  '90's. One of them wrote at the time of his death: \"Hero of thought and  of art, idealist, philosopher, genuine poet, prophetic theorist and  critic, sublime soul, comrade, joyous, generous, he was also in the last  years of his life a hero of humanity.\"    The most important figure of the school has been Giovanni Papini, who  has gathered about him in Florence a coterie which includes Ardengo  Soffici, the painter, critic, and novelist; Aldo Palazzeschi, poet;  Alberto Savinio, wanderer, musician, and litterateur; and a long list of  names more or less ancillary to Marinetti, some of which I shall mention  later.    Papini, who is considered at length in another chapter, does not admit  that he is a Futurist. As he puts it, he did not marry Futurism; it was  for him one of many intellectual adventures, a mistress that left an  indelible impression on him. He simply passed through Futurism's  influence and at the same time gave momentum to the best of that school,  to Palazzeschi, Govoni, Boccioni, Folgore. Then he proceeded alone,  after having become persuaded that it had become too popular and  consequently less refined and select, and after the hazardous and  aristocratic little group had become a species of low, bigoted democracy  into which any one could enter who dangled a rosary of incomprehensible  words. He left it in company with Soffici and Palazzeschi and soon Carra  and others followed his example. Thus, on the death of Boccioni, the  first generation of Futuristic writers reformed or disappeared.    Then there are many young men carrying the banner of literature in Italy  to-day who do not call themselves Futurist, and whose writings contain  less of the grotesque, which has been made familiar to Italian readers  by Marinetti's \"Zang Tumb Tumb.\" They are men of the stamp of Antonio  Beltramelli, Mario Mariani, Luigi Morselli, Gino Rocca, Salvator Gotta,  Lorenzo Montano, Vincenzo Cardarelli, Raffale Calzini, Enrico  Cavacchioli, Alfredo Grilli, and a score of others who not alone have  ideas but who keenly sense the composite world-thought, who believe that  the era of Big Business will reach its apogee when it weds Big Justice,  and who know how to express their ideas with explosive rhythmic  eloquence and with distinction of form.    It would be presumptuous on my part to attempt to select the winners  entered in the great sweepstakes of literary fame in Italy, with no  qualification for prophecy or judgment than a love of literature and a  lifelong ardent consumption of it. I shall, therefore, content myself  with brief discussion of the work of some of these younger writers with  the particular end in view of suggesting to others the pleasure and  profit that may result from more intimate acquaintance with them.    About ten years ago there began to appear in the Florentine publication,  _La Voce_, a series of articles critical and interpretative of French  art. It is difficult now to believe that Cezanne, Courbet, Renoir,  Picasso, Henri Rousseau, Gauguin, Van Gogh, and the school of  impressionists and neo-impressionists was so little known in Italy as  they were at the time of the appearance of these articles from the pen  of Ardengo Soffici, a painter by training and profession enrolled in the  Futuristic movement. He was, in reality, the first to speak in Italy  with appreciation and intelligence of the tendencies in French art shown  in the last half-century which have to-day had such a stamp of profound  approval put upon them. These criticisms attracted much attention from  the first, and they have since been republished under the title of  \"Scoperte e Massacri\" (\"Discoveries and Massacres\"), and to-day they  constitute a trustworthy guide to the schools mentioned both in  presentation and in description.    They were quite unlike previous criticisms, more particularly in a note  of challenge, of insolence, and of prophecy. His judgments were stated  with a firmness and tranquillity that savored of the dogmatic, and,  although time has shown him to have been mistaken in his estimate of  some of the artists discussed--Gauguin, for instance--it has  corroborated most of them with remarkable accuracy. In a small way he  did for Italian readers what Mr. MacColl did for English readers in his  \"Nineteenth Century Art,\" for, like that writer, he is an artist with a  fastidious temperament who knows how to write.    Since that time Signor Soffici has published nearly a score of  books--romances, criticisms, fragments which show him to be a clear  thinker with a pungent style, writing what he thinks and not what he  cribs from others, and not continually advertising himself as the last  cry of intelligence or the most perfect type of superman. His first book  was called \"Ignoto Toscano\" (\"An Unknown Tuscan\"), and appeared in 1909,  but it was not until the publication of \"Lemmonio Boreo\" two years later  that it was realized that there had appeared a writer with a definite  message: a protest against the utter triviality and purposelessness of  Italian middle-class life.    The hero, an artist, who would reform many customs of the land, went  about the countryside accompanied by two aids, one chosen for physical  strength, the other for his \"promoter\" type of mind. Their encounters  with the predatory innkeeper, with the peculating clerk, with the  industrious stone-breaker of the roads, with the pilferer of the farm or  the barn, and with the pulchritudinous peasant sitting picturesquely in  her cart or gossiping in the village constitute the substance of the  book. It was planned to have it run into several volumes, but it stopped  after the first one, without accomplishing any of the reforms that the  hero had essayed.    Then the writer reverted to art again and published a book on Cubism and  one on Cubism and Futurism. Soon he published Giornale di Bordo, a diary  of"]]]
