Boston, you  know as well as I do, is almost an island, and go which way you will,  you must cross a bridge to get out of it. I said I wanted to quit the  city, and was compelled to leave my horse behind. How could I ever  quit the place with that tormented beast? And warn't I compelled to  leave him when Old Scratch himself couldn't make him obey orders? If I  had a waited to leave town till he would cross a bridge, I should have  had to have waited till doomsday.'    \"He scratched his head and looked foolish. 'What a devil of a sell,'  said he. 'That will be a standing joke agin me as long as I live.'    \"'I don't see that,' said I, 'if you had been deceived, you might have  called it a sell, but you bought him with your eyes and ears open, and  a full knowledge of the truth. And, after all, where will you go to  better yourself? for the most that can be said is, you have got a  critter with a thousand virtues and but one vice.'    \"'Oh, get out!' said he, 'and let me alone.' And he walked off, and  looked as sheepish as you please.\"    \"'Oh dear!\" said the doctor; \"oh dear.\" And he placed his hands on his  ribs, and walked round the room in a bent position, like a man  affected with colic, and laughed as if he was hysterical, saying, \"Oh  dear! Oh, Mr Slick, that's a capital story. Oh, you would make a new  man of me soon, I am sure you would, if I was any time with you. I  haven't laughed before that way for many a long day. Oh, it does me  good. There is nothing like fun, is there? I haven't any myself, but I  do like it in others. Oh, we need it. We need all the counterweights  we can muster to balance the sad relations of life. God has made sunny  spots in the heart; why should we exclude the light from them?\"    \"Stick a pin in that, Doctor,\" says I, \"for it's worth rememberin' as  a wise saw.\"    He then took up his wallet, and retired to his room to change his  clothes, saying to himself, in an under-tone: \"Stick a pin in it. What  a queer phrase; and yet it's expressive, too. It's the way I preserve  my insects.\"    The foregoing conversation had scarcely terminated, when Peter's  daughters commenced their preparations for the evening meal. And I  confess I was never more surprised than at the appearance of the older  one, Jessie. In form and beauty she far exceeded the pilot's high  encomiums. She was taller than American women generally are; but she  was so admirably proportioned and well developed, you were not aware  of her height, till you saw her standing near her sister. Her motions  were all quiet, natural, and graceful, and there was an air about her,  that nothing but the native ease of a child of the forest, or highbred  elegance of fashionable life, can ever impart. She had the delicate  hands and small feet peculiar to Indian women. Her hair was of the  darkest and deepest jet, but not so coarse as that of the aborigines;  whilst her large black eyes were oval in shape, liquid, shaded by long  lashes, and over-arched by delicately-pencilled brows. Her neck was  long, but full, and her shoulders would have been the envy of a London  ball-room. She was a perfect model of a woman.    It is true she had had the advantage, when young, of being the  companion of the children of the Governor of the Fort, and had been  petted, partially educated, and patronised by his wife. But neither he  nor his lady could have imparted what it is probable neither  possessed, much polish of manner or refinement of mind. We hear of  nature's noblemen, but that means rather manly, generous, brave  fellows, than polished men. There are however splendid specimens of  men, and beautiful looking women, among the aborigines. Extremes meet;  and it is certain that the ease and grace of highly civilised life do  not surpass those of untutored nature, that neither concedes nor  claims a superiority to others. She was altogether of a different  stamp from her sister, who was a common-looking person, and resembled  the ordinary females to be found in savage life. Stout, strong, and  rather stolid, accustomed to drudge and to obey, rather than to be  petted and rule; to receive and not to give orders, and to submit from  habit and choice. One seemed far above, and the other as much below,  the station of their father. Jessie, though reserved, would converse  if addressed; the other shunned conversation as much as possible.    Both father and daughters seemed mutually attached to each other, and  their conversation was carried on with equal facility in Indian,  French, Gaelic, and English, although Peter spoke the last somewhat  indifferently. In the evening a young man, of the name of Fraser, with  his two sisters, children of a Highland neighbour, came in to visit  the McDonalds, and Peter producing his violin, we danced jigs and  reels, in a manner and with a spirit not often seen but in Ireland or  Scotland. The doctor, unable to withstand the general excitement,  joined in the dances with as much animation as any of us, and seemed  to enjoy himself amazingly.    \"Ah, Mr Slick,\" said he, patting me on the shoulder, \"this is the true  philosophy of life. But how is it with your disposition for fun, into  which you enter with all your heart, that you have such a store of  'wise saws.' How in the world did you ever acquire them? for your time  seems to have been spent more in the active pursuits of life than in  meditation. Excuse me, I neither undervalue your talent nor power of  observation, but the union does not seem quite natural, it is so much  out of the usual course of things.\"    \"Well,\" sais I, \"Doctor, you have been enough in the woods to know  that a rock, accidentally falling from a bank into a brook, or a  drift-log catching cross-ways of the stream, will often change its  whole course, and give it a different direction; haven't you? Don't  you know that the smallest and most trivial event often contains  colouring matter enough in it to change the whole complexion of our  life? For instance, one Saturday, not long before I left school, and  when I was a considerable junk of a boy, father gave me leave to go  and spend the day with Eb Snell, the son of our neighbour old Colonel  Jephunny Snell. We amused ourselves catching trout in the mill-pond,  and shooting king-fishers, about the hardest bird there is to kill in  all creation, and between one and the other sport, you may depend we  enjoyed ourselves first-rate. Towards evenin' I heard a most an awful  yell, and looked round, and there was Eb shoutin' and screamin' at the  tip eend of his voice, and a jumpin' up and down, as if he had been  bit by a rattlesnake.    \"'What in natur is the matter of you, Eb?' sais I. 'What are you a  makin' such an everlastin' touss about?' But the more I asked, the  more he wouldn't answer. At last, I thought I saw a splash in the  water, as if somebody was making a desperate splurging there, and I  pulled for it, and raced to where he was in no time, and sure enough  there was his little brother, Zeb, just a sinkin' out of sight. So I  makes a spring in after him in no time, caught him by the hair of his  head, just as he was vamosing, and swam ashore with him. The  bull-rushes and long water-grass was considerable thick there, and  once or twice I thought in my soul I should have to let go my hold of  the child, and leave him to save my own life, my feet got so tangled  in it; but I stuck to it like a good fellow, and worked my passage out  with the youngster.    \"Just then, down came the women folk and all the family of the Snells,  and the old woman made right at me, as cross as a bear that has cubs,  she looked like a perfect fury.    \"'You good-for-nothin' young scallowag,' said she, 'is that the way  you take care of that poor dear little boy, to let him fall into the  pond, and get half drowned?'    \"And she up and boxed my ears right and left, till sparks came out of  my eyes like a blacksmith's chimney, and my hat, which was all soft  with water, got the crown knocked in in the scuffle, and was as flat  as a pancake.    \"'What's all this,' sais Colonel Jephunny, who came runnin' out of the  mill. 'Eb,' sais he, 'what's all this?'    \"Well, the critter was so frightened he couldn't do nothin', but jump  up and down, nor say a word, but 'Sam, Sam!'    \"So the old man seizes a stick, and catchin' one of my hands in his,  turned to, and gave me a most an awful hidin'. He cut me into ribbons  a'most.    \"'I'll teach you,' he said, 'you villain, to throw a child into the  water arter that fashin.' And he turned to, and at it agin, as hard as  he could lay on. I believe in my soul he would have nearly killed me,  if it hadn't a been for a great big nigger wench he had, called Rose.  My! what a slashin' large woman, that was; half horse, half alligator,  with a cross of the mammoth in her. She wore a man's hat and jacket,  and her petticoat had stuff enough in it to make the mainsail of a  boat. Her foot was as long and as flat as a snow shoe, and her hands  looked as shapeless and as hard as two large sponges froze solid. Her  neck was as thick as a bull's, and her scalp was large and woolly  enough for a door-mat. She was as strong as a moose, and as ugly too;  and her great-white pointed teeth was a caution to a shark.    \"'Hullo,' sais she, 'here's the devil to pay, and no pitch hot. Are  you a goin' to kill that boy, massa?' and she seized hold of me and  took me away from him, and caught me up in her arms as easy as if I  was a doll.    \"'Here's a pretty hurrahs nest,' sais she, 'let me see one of you dare  to lay hands on this brave pickininny.

There's my good Mrs. Jervis! said I; God will  bless you for your good counsel to a poor maiden, that is hard beset.  But pray what did he say, when I was gone? Why, says she, he was very  angry with you. But he would hear it! said I: I think it was a little  bold; but then he provoked me to it. And had not my honesty been in the  case, I would not by any means have been so saucy. Besides, Mrs.  Jervis, consider it was the truth; if he does not love to hear of the  summer-house, and the dressing-room, why should he not be ashamed to  continue in the same mind? But, said she, when you had muttered this to  yourself, you might have told him any thing else. Well, said I, I cannot  tell a wilful lie, and so there's an end of it. But I find you now give  him up, and think there's danger in staying.--Lord bless me! I wish I  was well out of the house; so it was at the bottom of a wet ditch, on  the wildest common in England.    Why, said she, it signifies nothing to tell you all he said but it was  enough to make me fear you would not be so safe as I could wish;  and, upon my word, Pamela, I don't wonder he loves you; for, without  flattery, you are a charming girl! and I never saw you look more lovely  in your life than in that same new dress of yours. And then it was such  a surprise upon us all!--I believe truly, you owe some of your danger to  the lovely appearance you made. Then, said I, I wish the clothes in the  fire: I expected no effect from them; but, if any, a quite contrary one.    Hush! said I, Mrs. Jervis, did you not hear something stir in the  closet? No, silly girl, said she, your fears are always awake.--But  indeed, said I, I think I heard something rustle.--May be, says she, the  cat may be got there: but I hear nothing.    I was hush; but she said, Pr'ythee, my good girl, make haste to bed. See  if the door be fast. So I did, and was thinking to look into the closet;  but, hearing no more noise, thought it needless, and so went again and  sat myself down on the bed-side, and went on undressing myself. And  Mrs. Jervis being by this time undressed, stepped into bed, and bid me  hasten, for she was sleepy.    I don't know what was the matter, but my heart sadly misgave me: Indeed,  Mr. Jonathan's note was enough to make it do so, with what Mrs. Jervis  had said. I pulled off my stays, and my stockings, and all my clothes to  an under-petticoat; and then hearing a rustling again in the closet, I  said, Heaven protect us! but before I say my prayers, I must look into  this closet. And so was going to it slip-shod, when, O dreadful! out  rushed my master in a rich silk and silver morning gown.    I screamed, and ran to the bed, and Mrs. Jervis screamed too; and he  said, I'll do you no harm, if you forbear this noise; but otherwise take  what follows.    Instantly he came to the bed (for I had crept into it, to Mrs. Jervis,  with my coat on, and my shoes); and taking me in his arms, said, Mrs.  Jervis, rise, and just step up stairs to keep the maids from coming down  at this noise: I'll do no harm to this rebel.    O, for Heaven's sake! for pity's sake! Mrs. Jervis, said I, if I am not  betrayed, don't leave me; and, I beseech you, raise all the house. No,  said Mrs. Jervis, I will not stir, my dear lamb; I will not leave you.  I wonder at you, sir, said she; and kindly threw herself upon my coat,  clasping me round the waist: You shall not hurt this innocent, said she:  for I will lose my life in her defence. Are there not, said she, enough  wicked ones in the world, for your base purpose, but you must attempt  such a lamb as this?    He was desperate angry, and threatened to throw her out of the window;  and to turn her out of the house the next morning. You need not, sir,  said she; for I will not stay in it. God defend my poor Pamela  till to-morrow, and we will both go together.--Says he, let me but  expostulate a word or two with you, Pamela. Pray, Pamela, said Mrs.  Jervis, don't hear a word, except he leaves the bed, and goes to  the other end of the room. Ay, out of the room, said I; expostulate  to-morrow, if you must expostulate!    I found his hand in my bosom; and when my fright let me know it, I was  ready to die; and I sighed and screamed, and fainted away. And still he  had his arms about my neck; and Mrs. Jervis was about my feet, and upon  my coat. And all in a cold dewy sweat was I. Pamela! Pamela! said Mrs.  Jervis, as she tells me since, O--h, and gave another shriek, my poor  Pamela is dead for certain! And so, to be sure, I was for a time; for I  knew nothing more of the matter, one fit following another, till about  three hours after, as it proved to be, I found myself in bed, and Mrs.  Jervis sitting upon one side, with her wrapper about her, and Rachel on  the other; and no master, for the wicked wretch was gone. But I was so  overjoyed, that I hardly could believe myself; and I said, which were my  first words, Mrs. Jervis, Mrs. Rachel, can I be sure it is you? Tell  me! can I?--Where have I been? Hush, my dear, said Mrs. Jervis; you have  been in fit after fit. I never saw any body so frightful in my life!    By this I judged Rachel knew nothing of the matter; and it seems my  wicked master had, upon Mrs. Jervis's second noise on my fainting away,  slipt out, and, as if he had come from his own chamber, disturbed by  the screaming, went up to the maids' room, (who, hearing the noise, lay  trembling, and afraid to stir,) and bid them go down, and see what was  the matter with Mrs. Jervis and me. And he charged Mrs. Jervis, and  promised to forgive her for what she had said and done, if she would  conceal the matter. So the maids came down, and all went up again, when  I came to myself a little, except Rachel, who staid to sit up with me,  and bear Mrs. Jervis company. I believe they all guess the matter to be  bad enough; though they dare not say any thing.    When I think of my danger, and the freedoms he actually took, though I  believe Mrs. Jervis saved me from worse, and she said she did, (though  what can I think, who was in a fit, and knew nothing of the matter?) I  am almost distracted.    At first I was afraid of Mrs. Jervis; but I am fully satisfied she is  very good, and I should have been lost but for her; and she takes on  grievously about it. What would have become of me, had she gone out of  the room, to still the maids, as he bid her! He'd certainly have shut  her out, and then, mercy on me! what would have become of your poor  Pamela?    I must leave off a little; for my eyes and my head are sadly bad.--This  was a dreadful trial! This was the worst of all! Oh, that I was out of  the power of this dreadfully wicked man! Pray for                                                 Your distressed DAUGHTER.          LETTER XXVI      MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    I did not rise till ten o'clock, and I had all the concerns and wishes  of the family, and multitudes of inquiries about me. My wicked master  went out early to hunt; but left word he would be in to breakfast. And  so he was.    He came up to our chamber about eleven, and had nothing to do to be  sorry; for he was our master, and so put on sharp anger at first.    I had great emotions at his entering the room, and threw my apron over  my head, and fell a crying, as if my heart would break.    Mrs. Jervis, said he, since I know you, and you me so well, I don't know  how we shall live together for the future. Sir, said she, I will take  the liberty to say, what I think is best for both. I have so much  grief, that you should attempt to do any injury to this poor girl, and  especially in my chamber, that I should think myself accessary to the  mischief, if I was not to take notice of it. Though my ruin, therefore,  may depend upon it, I desire not to stay; but pray let poor Pamela and  me go together. With all my heart, said he; and the sooner the better.  She fell a crying. I find, says he, this girl has made a party of the  whole house in her favour against me. Her innocence deserves it of us  all, said she very kindly: and I never could have thought that the son  of my dear good lady departed, could have so forfeited his honour, as to  endeavour to destroy a virtue he ought to protect. No more of this,  Mrs. Jervis! said he; I will not hear it. As for Pamela, she has a lucky  knack of falling into fits, when she pleases. But the cursed yellings  of you both made me not myself. I intended no harm to her, as I told you  both, if you'd have left your squallings: And I did no harm neither, but  to myself; for I raised a hornet's nest about my ears, that, as far as I  know, may have stung to death my reputation. Sir, said Mrs. Jervis, then  I beg Mr. Longman may take my accounts, and I will go away as soon as  I can. As for Pamela, she is at her liberty, I hope, to go away next  Thursday, as she intends?    I sat still; for I could not speak nor look up, and his presence  discomposed me extremely; but I was sorry to hear myself the unhappy  occasion of Mrs. Jervis's losing her place, and hope that may be still  made up.    Well, said he, let Mr. Longman make up your accounts, as soon as you  will; and Mrs. Jewkes (who is his housekeeper in Lincolnshire) shall  come hither in your place, and won't be less obliging, I dare say, than  you have been. Said she, I have never disobliged you till now; and let  me tell you, sir, if you knew what belonged to your own reputation or  honour--No more, no more, said he, of these antiquated topics. I have  been no bad friend to you; and I shall always esteem you, though you  have not been so faithful to my secrets as I could have wished, and have  laid me open to this girl, which has"]]]
