It is usual for the agent at the point of shipment to send a copy  of the bill of lading to the agent where the goods are received.  In this way he can compare the consignment with the consignee's  bill.    EXPENSE BILLS    It is not usual to pay freight bills at the point of shipment,  that being left till the goods reach their destination.    The agent at the place of delivery makes out an \"expense bill,\"  which is an itemized statement of the freight charges, and must be  paid by the consignee before delivery.    This done, the consignee must sign a receipt for the goods  delivered, and the affair is closed.    A BILL AND A DRAFT    Before wholesale houses or manufacturers ship goods, they are  either paid for or they have a business understanding with the  consignee as to when and how the payment is to be made.    There are occasions, however, when no such arrangement has been  made, and a man not well known to the merchant orders goods  shipped by freight.    In a case like this, the merchant may ascertain through a  commercial agency--the agencies make it their business to keep  posted in such matters--the standing of the man giving the order.    Trade has its risks and the merchant, even where the information  is not quite assuring, may decide to fill the order and ship it.    As with express companies, goods may be sent as freight, C. O. D.    This is done by means of a bill of lading, to which is attached a  draft. The shipper bills the goods to himself at the point to  which they were ordered.    To the bill of lading he attaches a draft for the sum involved,  but this, instead of being forwarded to the consignee by mail, is  sent to him through a bank for collection.    Now before the consignee can get the bill of lading, which  authorizes him to receive the goods, he must pay the draft.    The bill, which is in the shipper's name, is then endorsed over to  the payer of the draft.    Country merchants and sometimes farmers send produce by freight to  be sold on commission in the city.    AN INVOICE            Delhi, N. Y., Sept. 9, 1910.

This is no doubt due to the fact that with every other form of  payment one has something tangible to show for the expenditure.    If every good citizen could be brought to see that his private  interests are closely linked with public affairs, he would take  more interest in the local politics of his town and county, and so  have a voice in the expenditure of taxes by selecting the best men  to do the work for him.    Taxes are forced contributions levied on citizens to provide money  for public expenses, such as law and order, schools, charities and  public institutions.    All tax laws are made by the men who pay the taxes.    You say \"No\" to this.    \"The tax laws are made by the legislators up at the state  capital.\"    Very true; but who nominates and elects the legislators? Did you  not put them into office?    \"No, the bosses did that,\" you reply.    True again, but good men are in the majority and if they did their  duty to their country and themselves, there would be no bosses and  taxes would be honestly spent.    KINDS OF TAXES    Tax laws are enacted by Congress, and by the legislatures of our  many states. Taxes cannot be collected without this authority.    State taxes are collected for the state use only.    United States taxes are expended for the benefit of all the people  of all the states.    Taxes may be further divided into direct and indirect.    Direct taxes are, at present, only employed by the states. They  are levied on realty and personal property, and are paid by the  particular person named in the tax bill presented by the  authorized collector.    The amount of these taxes vary each year, depending on the public  requirements.    They are based on assessments made by officers appointed for the  purpose and generally known as assessors.    CUSTOMS DUTY    Though there is no demand made on each individual to pay the  indirect taxes required by the Government, yet indirectly every  person who spends little or much money is paying them.    The Government's chief means of raising the great sums of money  needed yearly to carry on its machinery is by customs duties and  internal revenue collections.    The customs revenue is obtained from a tax levied on certain  articles imported from foreign countries.    This customs tax is called a tariff.    The question as to the goods that shall be subject to a tariff and  the amount to be levied on the same, is one that has long  perplexed statesmen and been a leading party issue.    The merchant, to whom the goods are assigned from a foreign port,  must pay the duty levied on them by a Government Appraiser before  he can take them away.    Private parties, landing from abroad at any of our ports of entry,  are required, before getting their baggage, to write out a  declaration of the things contained in their trunks. But this  declaration does not prevent the customs inspectors from making a  careful personal examination. All things found dutiable, whether  declared or not, are set apart and held until the assessment or  duty is paid.    The evasion of a customs duty is called \"smuggling\" and is  punished by the confiscation of the goods, and penalties in the  way of fine and imprisonment.    There are people who would consider it a sin to cheat their  butcher, but see no wrong in cheating the Government.    To the merchant who pays tariff duties the amount involved is a  direct tax.    When the merchant sells his goods to the retailer or consumer, he  adds the tariff to his freight, insurance, interest, etc., as  direct purchase cost. This is strict business, but the consumer  pays all the bills with the profit added.    INTERNAL REVENUE    The second great source of Government revenue is derived from the  internal revenue tax, or excise duties.    Manufacturers of alcohol, whether as wine, whiskey, or beer, and  the producers of tobacco, in its manufactured forms, have to pay  an excise tax in proportion to the amount and character of their  products.    As with the customs tax, the excise tax is added by the  manufacturer to the cost of production, so that at last it is the  consumer who pays it.    STAMPS    While the manufacturers of alcohol pay the excise tax in bulk,  that is on the number of gallons produced, the manufacturers of  cigars and tobacco have to attach to each separate package a  distinct internal revenue stamp.    These stamps are purchased from the internal revenue collectors,  appointed by the Government to certain districts. The stamps show  at a glance that the proper tax has been paid, just as the postage  stamp affixed to a letter proves that the price for carrying it  and delivering it has been paid.    As it is a penal offence to use a postage stamp a second time, so  it is a punishable offence to attempt the use of a cancelled or  torn internal revenue stamp.    If demanded, the Government will give a receipt for the sum  received from any one for considerable sales of postal or revenue  stamps.    STATE TAXES    State taxes, as has been stated, are levied on real and personal  property. Some states have in addition a poll tax. This is levied  on the individual without any regard to his property, and a  receipt for it may be a requirement before a citizen is permitted  to vote.    Of course the real estate and personal property taxes are not the  same in all the states, for each state must raise every year the  sum necessary to meet its own special requirements.    The intention of all tax laws is to have every citizen's  contribution bear the same proportion to the whole amount to be  raised that his possessions bear to the aggregate property of all  the owners in the commonwealth.    EXEMPT FROM TAXES    All our state laws exempt from taxation certain kinds of property.    The state cannot tax the property held by itself for the common  use.    The buildings and related properties of religious bodies and  societies are not taxable.    Such educational institutions as colleges, seminaries, and private  charities are not taxed.    Cemeteries and other places where the dead are disposed of are not  taxed.    County buildings, city parks, public schools, penal institutions,  fair grounds for public use and similar property is never taxed.    INSUFFICIENT TAXES    There have been times in the life of the Government, and in the  building up of the states, when the funds necessary for  maintenance from taxes, heavy though these have been at times,  have not been sufficient to meet the essential expenditures.    This was particularly the case with our Government during the  trying days of our Civil War.    States entering on great public works, for the benefit of the  commonwealth, frequently cannot raise the necessary money by the  usual forms of taxation.    In these cases loans have to be made, that is the Government and  the state go out and borrow from those who have it to spare, the  necessary money.    The Government, the state, and it may be the city or county, gives  to the party providing the money what is known as bond or bonds,  each of a fixed amount and bearing a fixed rate of interest,  payable as a rule semi-annually.    PERSONAL PROPERTY    There is no form of property so easy to assess for the purpose of  taxation as real estate, that is the land and the buildings, for  the last selling value of this property is a matter of public  record, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6168"],[0,"Fifty Famous People: A Book of Short Stories (#13)"],[1,"e. There  are great storms on the sea. Many ships are wrecked and the sailors  are drowned.\" \"I am not afraid\" said Robinson Crusoe. \"I am going to  be a sailor and nothing else.\"    So, when he was eighteen years old, he ran away from his pleasant home  and went to sea.    He soon found that his mother's words were true.    A sailor's life is indeed a hard life. There is no time to play. Every  day there is much work to be done. Sometimes there is great danger.    Robinson Crusoe sailed first on one ship and then on another. He  visited many lands and saw many wonderful things.    One day there was a great storm. The ship was driven about by the  winds; it was wrecked. All the sailors were drowned but Robinson  Crusoe.    He swam to an island that was not far away. It was a small island, and  there was no one living on it. But there were birds in the woods and  some wild goats on the hills.    For a long time Robinson Crusoe was all alone. He had only a dog and  some cats to keep him company. Then he tamed a parrot and some goats.    He built a house of some sticks and vines. He sowed grain and baked  bread. He made a boat for himself. He did a great many things. He was  busy every day.    At last a ship happened to pass that way and Robinson was taken on  board. He was glad to go back to England to see his home and his  friends once more.    This is the story which Mr. Defoe wrote. Perhaps he would not have  thought of it, had he not first heard the true story of Alexander  Selkirk.          THE KING AND THE PAGE        Many years ago there was a king of Prussia, whose name was Frederick;  and because he was very wise and very brave, people called him  Frederick the Great. Like other kings, he lived in a beautiful palace  and had many officers and servants to wait upon him.    Among the servants there was a little page whose name was Carl. It was  Carl's duty to sit outside of the king's bedroom and be ready to serve  him at any time.    One night the king sat up very late, writing letters and sending  messages; and the little page was kept busy running on errands until  past midnight.    The next morning the king wished to send him on another errand. He  rang the little bell which was used to call the page, but no page  answered.    \"I wonder what can have happened to the boy,\" he said; and he opened  the door and looked out. There, sitting in his chair, was Carl, fast  asleep. The poor child was so tired after his night's work that he  could not keep awake.    The king was about to waken him roughly, when he saw a piece of paper  on the floor beside him. He picked it up and read it.    It was a letter from the page's mother:--    _Dearest Carl; You are a good boy to send me all your wages, for now  I can pay the rent and buy some warm clothing for your little sister.  I thank you for it, and pray that God will bless you. Be faithful to  the king and do your duty._    The king went back to the room on tiptoe. He took ten gold pieces from  his table and wrapped them in the little letter. Then he went out  again, very quietly, and slipped them all into the boy's pocket.    After a while he rang the bell again, very loudly.    Carl awoke with a start, and came quickly to answer the call.    \"I think you have been asleep,\" said the king.    The boy stammered and did not know what to say. He was frightened and  ready to cry.    He put his hand in his pocket, and was surprised to find the gold  pieces wrapped in his mother's letter. Then his eyes overflowed with  tears, and he fell on his knees before the king.    \"What is the matter?\" asked Frederick.    \"Oh, your Majesty!\" cried Carl. \"Have mercy on me. It is true that I  have been asleep, but I know nothing about this money. Some one is  trying to ruin me.\"    \"Have courage, my boy,\" said the king. \"I know how you must have been  overwearied with long hours of watching. And people say that fortune  comes to us in our sleep. You may send the gold pieces to your mother  with my compliments; and tell her that the king will take care of both  her and you.\"          THE HUNTED KING        What boy or girl has not heard the story of King Robert Brace and the  spider? I will tell you another story of the same brave and famous  king. He had fought a battle with his enemies, the English. His little  army had been beaten and scattered. Many of his best friends had been  killed or captured. The king himself was obliged to hide in the wild  woods while his foes hunted for him with hounds.    For many days he wandered through rough and dangerous places. He waded  rivers and climbed mountains. Sometimes two or three faithful friends  were with him. Sometimes he was alone. Sometimes his enemies were very  close upon him.    Late one evening he came to a little farmhouse in a lonely valley. He  walked in without knocking. A woman was sitting alone by the fire.    \"May a poor traveler find rest and shelter here for the night?\" he  asked. The woman answered, \"All travelers are welcome for the sake of  one; and you are welcome\"    \"Who is that one?\" asked the king.    \"That is Robert the Bruce,\" said the woman. \"He is the rightful lord  of this country. He is now being hunted with hounds, but I hope soon  to see him king over all Scotland.\"    \"Since you love him so well,\" said the king, \"I will tell you  something. I am Robert the Bruce.\"    \"You!\" cried the woman in great surprise. \"Are you the Bruce, and are  you all alone?\"    \"My men have been scattered,\" said the king, \"and therefore there is  no one with me.\"    \"That is not right,\" said the brave woman. \"I have two sons who are  gallant and trusty. They shall go with you and serve you.\"    So she called her two sons. They were tall and strong young men, and  they gladly promised to go with the king and help him.    [Illustration]    The king sat down by the fire, and the woman hurried to get things  ready for supper. The two young men got down their bows and arrows,  and all were busy making plans for the next day.    Suddenly a great noise was heard outside. They listened. They heard  the tramping of horses and the voices of a number of men.    \"The English! the English!\" said the young men.    \"Be brave, and defend your king with your lives,\" said their mother.    Then some one outside called loudly, \"Have you seen King Robert the  Bruce pass this way?\"    \"That is my brother Edward's voice,\" said the king. \"These are friends,  not enemies.\"    The door was thrown open and he saw a hundred brave men, all ready to  give him aid. He forgot his hunger; he forgot his weariness. He began  to ask about his enemies who had been hunting him.    \"I saw two hundred of them in the village below us,\" said one of his  officers. \"They are resting there for the night and have no fear of  danger from us. If you have a mind to make haste, we may surprise  them.\"    \"Then let us mount and ride,\" said the king.    The next minute they were off. They rushed suddenly into the village.  They routed the king's enemies and scattered them.    And Robert the Bruce was never again obliged to hide in the woods or  to run from savage hounds. Soon he became the real king and ruler of  all Scotland,        \"TRY, TRY AGAIN!\"      There was once a famous ruler of Tartary whose name was Tamerlane.  Like Alexander the Great, he wished to become the master of the whole  world. So he raised a great army and made war against other countries.  He conquered many kings and burned many cities.    But at last his army was beaten; his men were scattered; and Tamerlane  fled alone from the field of battle.    For a long time he wandered in fear from place to place. His foes were  looking for him. He was in despair. He was about to lose all hope.    One day he was lying under a tree, thinking of his misfortunes. He had  now been a wanderer for twenty days. He could not hold out much  longer. Suddenly he saw a small object creeping up the trunk of the  tree. He looked more closely and saw that it was an ant. The ant was  carrying a grain of wheat as large as itself.    As Tamerlane looked, he saw that there was a hole in the tree only a  little way above, and that this was the home of the ant. \"You are a  brave fellow, Mr. Ant,\" he said; \"but you have a heavy load to carry.\"    Just as he spoke, the ant lost its footing and fell to the ground. But  it still held on to the grain of wheat.    A second time it tried to carry its load up the rough trunk of the  tree, and a second time it failed.    Tamerlane watched the brave little insect. It tried three times, four  times, a dozen times, twenty times--but always with the same result.    Then it tried the twenty-first time. Slowly, one little step at a time,  it crept up across the rough place where it had slipped and fallen so  often. The next minute it ran safely into its home, carrying its  precious load. \"Well done!\" said Tamerlane. \"You have taught me a  lesson. I, too, will try, try again, till I succeed.\"    And this he did.    Of what other story does this remind you?          WHY HE CARRIED THE TURKEY        In Richmond, Virginia, one Saturday morning, an old man went into the  market to buy something. He was dressed plainly, his coat was worn,  and his hat was dingy. On his arm he carried a small basket.    \"I wish to get a fowl for to-morrow's dinner,\" he said.    The market man showed him a fat turkey, plump and white and ready for  roasting.    \"Ah! that is just what I want,\" said the old man. \"My wife will be  delighted with it.\"    He asked the price and paid for it. The market man wrapped a paper  round it and put it in the basket.    Just then a young man stepped up. \"I will take one of those turkeys,\"  he said. He was dressed in fine style and carried a small cane.    \"Shall I wrap it up for you?\" asked the market man.    \"Yes, here is your money,\" answered the young gentleman; \"and send it  to my house at once.\"    \"I cannot do that,\" said the market man. \"My errand boy is sick to-  day, and there "]]]
