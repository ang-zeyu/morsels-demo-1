The next afternoon, as Elsie was returning from her walk, she met her  father.    \"Elsie,\" said he, in a reproving tone, \"I have forbidden you to walk  out alone; are you disobeying me?\"    \"No, papa,\" she replied meekly, raising her eyes to his face, \"I was  not alone until about five minutes ago, when Aunt Adelaide and Louise  left me. They said it did not matter, as I was so near home; and they  were going to make a call, and did not want me along.\"    \"Very well,\" he said, taking hold of her hand and making her walk by  his side. \"How far have you been?\"    \"We went down the river bank to the big spring, papa. I believe it is a  little more than a mile that way; but when we came home, we made it  shorter by coming across some of the fields and through the meadow.\"    \"Through the meadow?\" said Mr. Dinsmore; \"don't you go there again,  Elsie, unless I give you express permission.\"    \"Why, papa?\" she asked, looking up at him in some surprise.    \"Because I forbid it,\" he replied sternly; \"that is quite enough for  you to know; all you have to do is to obey, and you need never ask me  why, when I give you an order.\"    Elsie's eyes filled, and a big tear rolled quickly down her cheek.    \"I did not mean to be naughty, papa,\" she said, struggling to keep down  a sob, \"and I will try never to ask why again.\"    \"There is another thing,\" said he. \"You cry quite too easily; it is  entirely too babyish for a girl of your age; you must quit it.\"    \"I will try, papa,\" said the little girl, wiping her eyes, and making a  great effort to control her feelings.    They had entered the avenue while this conversation was going on, and  were now drawing near the house; and just at this moment a little girl  about Elsie's age came running to meet them, exclaiming, \"O Elsie! I'm  glad you've come at last. We've been here a whole hour--mamma, and  Herbert, and I--and I've been looking for you all this time.\"    \"How do you do, Miss Lucy Carrington? I see you can talk as fast as  ever,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, laughing, and holding out his hand.    Lucy took it, saying with a little pout, \"To be sure, Mr. Dinsmore, it  isn't more than two or three weeks since you were at our house, and I  wouldn't forget how to talk in that time.\" Then, looking at Elsie, she  went on, \"We've come to stay a week; won't we have a fine time?\" and,  catching her friend round the waist, she gave her a hearty squeeze.    \"I hope so,\" said Elsie, returning the embrace. \"I am glad you have  come.\"    \"Is your papa here, Miss Lucy?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore.    \"Yes, sir; but he's going home again to-night, and then he'll come back  for us next week.\"    \"I must go in and speak to him,\" said Mr. Dinsmore. \"Elsie, do you  entertain Lucy.\"    \"Yes, sir, I will,\" said Elsie. \"Come with me to my room, won't you,  Lucy?\"    \"Yes; but won't you speak to mamma first? and Herbert, too; you are  such a favorite with both of them; and they still are in the  dressing-room, for mamma is not very well, and was quite fatigued with  her ride.\"    Lucy led the way to her mamma's room, as she spoke, Elsie following.    \"Ah! Elsie dear, how do you do? I'm delighted to see you,\" said Mrs.  Carrington, rising from the sofa as they entered.    Then, drawing the little girl closer to her, she passed her arm  affectionately around her waist, and kissed her several times.    \"I suppose you are very happy now that your papa has come home at  last?\" she said, looking searchingly into Elsie's face. \"I remember you  used to be looking forward so to his return; constantly talking of it  and longing for it.\"    Poor Elsie, conscious that her father's presence had not brought with  it the happiness she had anticipated, and yet unwilling either to  acknowledge that fact or tell an untruth, was at a loss what to say.    But she was relieved from the necessity of replying by Herbert, Lucy's  twin brother, a pale, sickly-looking boy, who had for several years  been a sufferer from hip complaint.    \"O Elsie!\" he exclaimed, catching hold of her hand and squeezing it  between both of his, \"I'm ever so glad to see you again.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Carrington, \"Herbert always says nobody can tell him  such beautiful stories as Elsie; and nobody but his mother and his old  mammy was half so kind to run and wait on him when he was laid on his  back for so many weeks. He missed you very much when we went home, and  often wished he was at Roselands again.\"    \"How is your hip now, Herbert?\" asked Elsie, looking pityingly at the  boy's pale face.    \"Oh! a great deal better, thank you. I can take quite long walks  sometimes now, though I still limp, and cannot run and leap like other  boys.\"    They chatted a few moments longer, and then Elsie went to her room to  have her hat taken off, and her hair made smooth before the tea-bell  should ring.    The two little girls were seated together at the table, Elsie's papa  being on her other side.    \"How nice these muffins are! Don't you like them, Elsie?\" asked Lucy,  as she helped herself to a third or fourth.    \"Yes, very much,\" said Elsie, cheerfully.    \"Then what are you eating that cold bread for? and you haven't got any  butter, either. Pompey, why don't hand Miss Elsie the butter?\"    \"No, Lucy, I mustn't have it. Papa does not allow me to eat hot cakes  or butter,\" said Elsie, in the same cheerful tone in which she had  spoken before.    Lucy opened her eyes very wide, and drew in her breath.    \"Well,\" she exclaimed, \"I guess if _my_ papa should try that on me, I'd  make such a fuss he'd _have_ to let me eat just whatever I wanted.\"    \"Elsie knows better than to do that,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, who had  overheard the conversation; \"she would only get sent away from the  table and punished for her naughtiness.\"    \"I wouldn't do it anyhow, papa,\" said Elsie, raising her eyes  beseechingly to his face.    \"No, daughter, I don't believe you would,\" he replied in an unusually  kind tone, and Elsie's face flushed with pleasure.    Several days passed away very pleasantly, Lucy sharing Elsie's studies  in the mornings, while Herbert remained with his mamma; and then in the  afternoon all walking or riding out together, unless the weather was  too warm, when they spent the afternoon playing in the veranda, on the  shady side of the house, and took their ride or walk after the sun was  down.    Arthur and Walter paid but little attention to Herbert, as his lameness  prevented him from sharing in the active sports which they preferred;  for they had never been taught to yield their wishes to others, and  were consequently extremely selfish and overbearing; but Elsie was very  kind, and did all in her power to interest and amuse him.    One afternoon they all walked out together, attended by Jim; but Arthur  and Walter, unwilling to accommodate their pace to Herbert's slow  movements, were soon far in advance, Jim following close at their heels.    \"They're quite out of sight,\" said Herbert presently, \"and I'm very  tired. Let's sit down on this bank, girls; I want to try my new bow,  and you may run and pick up my arrows for me.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Lucy, laughing; \"Elsie may do it if she likes,  but as for me, _I_ mean to take a nap; this nice, soft grass will make  an elegant couch;\" and throwing herself down, she soon was, or  pretended to be, in a sound slumber; while Herbert, seating himself  with his back against a tree, amused himself with shooting his arrows  here and there, Elsie running for them and bringing them to him, until  she was quite heated and out of breath.    \"Now I must rest a little, Herbert,\" she said at length, sitting down  beside him. \"Shall I tell you a story?\"    \"Oh! yes, do; I like your stories, and I don't mind leaving off  shooting till you're done,\" said he, laying down his bow.    Elsie's story lasted about ten minutes, and when she had finished,  Herbert took up his bow again, saying, \"I guess you're rested now,  Elsie,\" and sent an arrow over into the meadow.    \"There! just see how far I sent that! do run and bring it to me,  Elsie!\" he cried, \"and let me see if I can't hit that tree next time;  I've but just missed it.\"    \"I'm tired, Herbert; but I'll run and bring it to you this once,\"  replied Elsie, forgetting entirely her father's prohibition; \"but then  you must try to wait until Jim comes back before you shoot any more.\"    So saying, she darted away, and came back in a moment with the arrow in  her hand. But a sudden recollection had come over her just as she left  the meadow, and throwing down the arrow at the boy's feet, she  exclaimed in an agitated tone, \"O Herbert! I must go home just as  quickly as I can; I had forgotten--oh! how _could_ I forget! oh! what  will papa say!\"    \"Why, what's the matter?\" asked Herbert in alarm.    \"Never mind,\" said Elsie, sobbing. \"There are the boys coming; they  will take care of you, and I must go home. Good-bye.\"    And she ran quickly up the road, Herbert following her retreating form  with wondering eyes.    Elsie sped onward, crying bitterly as she went.    \"Where is papa!\" she inquired of a servant whom she met in the avenue.    \"Dunno, Miss Elsie, but I reckon Massa Horace am in de house, kase his  horse am in de stable.\"    Elsie hardly waited for the answer, but hurrying into the house, went  from room to room, looking and asking in vain for her father. He was  not in the drawing-room, or the library, or his own apartments. She had  just come out of this, and meeting a chamber-maid in the hall, she  exclaimed, \"O Fanny! where _is_ papa? can't you tell me? for I must see  him.\"    \"Here I am, Elsie; what do you want with me?\" called out her father's  voice from the veranda, where she had neglected to look.    \"What do you want?\" he repeated, as his little girl appeared before him  with her flushed and tearful face.

In the summer of 1872 the writer visited one of these rock cemeteries  in middle Utah, which had been used for a period not exceeding fifteen  or twenty years. It was situated at the bottom of a rock slide, upon  the side of an almost inaccessible mountain, in a position so  carefully chosen for concealment that it would have been almost  impossible to find it without a guide. Several of the graves were  opened and found to have been constructed in the following manner: A  number of bowlders had been removed from the bed of the slide until a  sufficient cavity had been obtained; this was lined with skins, the  corpse placed therein, with weapons, ornaments, etc., and covered over  with saplings of the mountain aspen; on top of these the removed  bowlders were piled, forming a huge cairn, which appeared large enough  to have marked the last resting place of an elephant. In the immediate  vicinity of the graves were scattered the osseous remains of a number  of horses which had been sacrificed no doubt during the funeral  ceremonies. In one of the graves, said to contain the body of a chief,  in addition to a number of articles useful and ornamental, were found  parts of the skeleton of a boy, and tradition states that a captive  boy was buried alive at this place.    In connection with this mode of burial it may be said that the ancient  Balearic Islanders covered their dead with a heap of stones, but this  ceremony was preceded by an operation which consisted in cutting the  body in small pieces and collecting in a pot.        CREMATION.      Next should be noted this mode of disposing of the dead, a common  custom to a considerable extent among North American tribes,  especially those living on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains,  although we have undoubted evidence that it was also practiced among  the more eastern ones. This rite may be considered as peculiarly  interesting from its great antiquity, for Tegg informs us that it  reached as far back as the Theban war, in the account of which mention  is made of the burning of Menoaeus and Archemorus, who were  contemporary with Jair, eighth judge of Israel. It was common in the  interior of Asia and among the ancient Greeks and Romans, and has also  prevailed among the Hindoos up to the present time. In fact, it is now  rapidly becoming a custom among civilized people.    While there is a certain degree of similarity between the performance  of this rite among the peoples spoken of and the Indians of North  America, yet, did space admit, a discussion might profitably be  entered upon regarding the details of it among the ancients and the  origin of the ceremony. As it is, simple narrations of cremation in  this country, with discursive notes and an account of its origin among  the Nishinams of California, by Stephen Powers, [Footnote: Cont. to N.  A. Ethnol., 1877, vol. iii, p. 341] seem to be all that is required at  this time.    \"The moon and the coyote wrought together in creating all things that  exist. The moon was good, but the coyote was bad. In making men and  women the moon wished to so fashion their souls that when they died  they should return to the earth after two or three days, as he himself  does when he dies. But the coyote was evil disposed, and said this  should not be, but that when men died their friends should burn their  bodies, and once a year make a great mourning for them, and the coyote  prevailed. So, presently when a deer died, they burned his body, as  the coyote had decreed, and after a year they made a great mourning  for him. But the moon created the rattlesnake and caused it to bite  the coyote's son, so that he died. Now, though the coyote had been  willing to burn the deer's relations, he refused to burn his own son.  Then the moon said unto him, 'This is your own rule. You would have it  so, and now your son shall be burned like the others.' So he was  burned, and after a year the coyote mourned for him. Thus the law was  established over the coyote also, and, as he had dominion over men, it  prevailed over men likewise.    \"This story is utterly worthless for itself, but it has its value in  that it shows there was a time when the California Indians did not  practice cremation, which is also established by other traditions. It  hints at the additional fact that the Nishinams to this day set great  store by the moon; consider it their benefactor in a hundred ways, and  observe its changes for a hundred purposes.\"    Another myth regarding cremation is given by Adam Johnston, in  Schoolcraft [Footnote: Hist. Indian tribes of the United States, 1854,  part IV, p. 224] and relates to the Bonaks, or root-diggers:    \"The first Indians that lived were coyotes. When one of their number  died the body became full of little animals or spirits, as they  thought them. After crawling over the body for a time they took all  manner of shapes, some that of the deer, others the elk, antelope,  etc. It was discovered, however, that great numbers were taking wings,  and for a while they sailed about in the air, but eventually they  would fly off to the moon. The old coyotes or Indians, fearing the  earth might become depopulated in this way, concluded to stop it at  once, and ordered that when one of their people died the body must be  burnt. Ever after they continued to burn the bodies of deceased  persons.\"    Ross Cox [Footnote: Adventures on the Columbia River, 1831, vol. ii,  p. 387] gives an account of the process as performed by the Tolkotins  of Oregon:    \"The ceremonies attending the dead are very singular, and quite  peculiar to this tribe. The body of the deceased is kept nine days  laid out in his lodge, and on the tenth it is buried. For this purpose  a rising ground is selected, on which are laid a number of sticks,  about seven feet long, of cypress, neatly split, and in the  interstices is placed a quantity of gummy wood. During these  operations invitations are dispatched to the natives of the  neighboring villages requesting their attendance at the ceremony. When  the preparations are perfected the corpse is placed on the pile, which  is immediately ignited, and during the process of burning, the  bystanders appear to be in a high state of merriment. If a stranger  happen to be present they invariably plunder him, but if that pleasure  be denied them, they never separate without quarreling among  themselves. Whatever property the deceased possessed is placed about  the corpse, and if he happened to be a person of consequence, his  friends generally purchase a capote, a shirt, a pair of trousers,  etc., which articles are also laid around the pile. If the doctor who  attended him has escaped uninjured, he is obliged to be present at the  ceremony, and for the last time tries his skill in restoring the  defunct to animation. Failing in this, he throws on the body a piece  of leather, or some other article, as a present, which in some measure  appeases the resentment of his relatives, and preserves the  unfortunate quack from being maltreated. During the nine days the  corpse is laid out the widow of the deceased is obliged to sleep along  side it from sunset to sunrise; and from this custom there is no  relaxation even during the hottest days of summer! While the doctor is  performing his last operations she must lie on the pile, and after the  fire is applied to it she cannot stir until the doctor orders her to  be removed, which, however, is never done until her body is completely  covered with blisters. After being placed on her legs, she is obliged  to pass her hands gently through the flame and collect some of the  liquid fat which issues from the corpse, with which she is permitted  to wet her face and body! When the friends of the deceased observe the  sinews of the legs and arms beginning to contract they compel the  unfortunate widow to go again on the pile, and by dint of hard  pressing to straighten those members.    \"If during her husband's lifetime she has been known to have committed  any act of infidelity or omitted administering to him savory food or  neglected his clothing, etc, she is now made to suffer severely for  such lapses of duty by his relations, who frequently fling her in the  funeral pile, from which she is dragged by her friends; and thus  between alternate scorching and cooling she is dragged backwards and  forwards until she falls into a state of insensibility.    \"After the process of burning the corpse has terminated, the widow  collects the larger bones, which she rolls up in an envelope of birch  bark, and which she is obliged for some years afterwards to carry on  her back. She is now considered and treated as a slave, all the  laborious duties of cooking, collecting fuel, etc., devolve on her.  She must obey the orders of all the women, and even of the children  belonging to the village, and the slightest mistake or disobedience  subjects her to the infliction of a heavy punishment. The ashes of her  husband are carefully collected and deposited in a grave, which it is  her duty to keep free from weeds; and should any such appear, she is  obliged to root them out with her _fingers_. During this  operation her husband's relatives stand by and beat her in a cruel  manner until the task is completed or she falls a victim to their  brutality. The wretched widows, to avoid this complicated cruelty,  frequently commit suicide. Should she, however, linger on for three or  four years, the friends of her husband agree to relieve her from her  painful mourning. This is a ceremony of much consequence, and the  preparations for it occupy a considerable time, generally from six to  eight months. The hunters proceed to the various districts in which  deer and beaver abound, and after collecting large quantities of meat  and fur return to the village. The skins are immediately bartered for  guns, ammunition, clothing, trinkets, etc. Invitations are then bent  to the inhabitants of the "]]]
