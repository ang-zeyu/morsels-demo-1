Baree was fascinated by this work, and he never grew tired of watching  it. It puzzled and bewildered him. Day after day he saw them float  timber and brush through the water for the new dam. He saw this dam  growing steadily under their efforts. One day he lay within a dozen  feet of an old beaver who was cutting down a tree six inches through.  When the tree fell, and the old beaver scurried away, Baree scurried,  too. Then he came back and smelled of the cutting, wondering what it  was all about, and why Umisk's uncle or grandfather or aunt had gone to  all that trouble.    He still could not induce Umisk and the other young beavers to join him  in play, and after the first week or so he gave up his efforts. In  fact, their play puzzled him almost as much as the dam-building  operations of the older beavers. Umisk, for instance, was fond of  playing in the mud at the edge of the pond. He was like a very small  boy. Where his elders floated timbers from three inches to a foot in  diameter to the big dam, Umisk brought small sticks and twigs no larger  around than a lead pencil to his playground, and built a make-believe  dam of his own.    Umisk would work an hour at a time on this play dam as industriously as  his father and mother were working on the big dam, and Baree would lie  flat on his belly a few feet away, watching him and wondering mightily.  And through this half-dry mud Umisk would also dig his miniature  canals, just as a small boy might have dug his Mississippi River and  pirate-infested oceans in the outflow of some back-lot spring. With his  sharp little teeth he cut down his big timber--willow sprouts never  more than an inch in diameter; and when one of these four or five-foot  sprouts toppled down, he undoubtedly felt as great a satisfaction as  Beaver Tooth felt when he sent a seventy-foot birch crashing into the  edge of the pond. Baree could not understand the fun of all this. He  could see some reason for nibbling at sticks--he liked to sharpen his  teeth on sticks himself; but it puzzled him to explain why Umisk so  painstakingly stripped the bark from the sticks and swallowed it.    Another method of play still further discouraged Baree's advances. A  short distance from the spot where he had first seen Umisk there was a  shelving bank that rose ten or twelve feet from the water, and this  bank was used by the young beavers as a slide. It was worn smooth and  hard. Umisk would climb up the bank at a point where it was not so  steep. At the top of the slide he would put his tail out flat behind  him and give himself a shove, shooting down the toboggan and landing in  the water with a big splash. At times there were from six to ten young  beavers engaged in this sport, and now and then one of the older  beavers would waddle to the top of the slide and take a turn with the  youngsters.    One afternoon, when the toboggan was particularly wet and slippery from  recent use, Baree went up the beaver path to the top of the bank, and  began investigating. Nowhere had he found the beaver smell so strong as  on the slide. He began sniffing and incautiously went too far. In an  instant his feet shot out from under him, and with a single wild yelp  he went shooting down the toboggan. For the second time in his life he  found himself struggling under water, and when a minute or two later he  dragged himself up through the soft mud to the firmer footing of the  shore, he had at last a very well-defined opinion of beaver play.    It may be that Umisk saw him. It may be that very soon the story of his  adventure was known by all the inhabitants of Beaver Town. For when  Baree came upon Umisk eating his supper of alder bark that evening,  Umisk stood his ground to the last inch, and for the first time they  smelled noses. At least Baree sniffed audibly, and plucky little Umisk  sat like a rolled-up sphinx. That was the final cementing of their  friendship--on Baree's part. He capered about extravagantly for a few  moments, telling Umisk how much he liked him, and that they'd be great  chums. Umisk didn't talk. He didn't make a move until he resumed his  supper. But he was a companionable-looking little fellow, for all that,  and Baree was happier than he had been since the day he left the old  windfall.    This friendship, even though it outwardly appeared to be quite  one-sided, was decidedly fortunate for Umisk. When Baree was at the  pond, he always kept as near to Umisk as possible, when he could find  him. One day he was lying in a patch of grass, half asleep, while Umisk  busied himself in a clump of alder shoots a few yards away. It was the  warning crack of a beaver tail that fully roused Baree; and then  another and another, like pistol shots. He jumped up. Everywhere  beavers were scurrying for the pond.    Just then Umisk came out of the alders and hurried as fast as his  short, fat legs would carry him toward the water. He had almost reached  the mud when a lightning flash of red passed before Baree's eyes in the  afternoon sun, and in another instant Napakasew--the he-fox--had  fastened his sharp fangs in Umisk's throat. Baree heard his little  friend's agonized cry; he heard the frenzied flap-flap-flap of many  tails--and his blood pounded suddenly with the thrill of excitement and  rage.    As swiftly as the red fox himself, Baree darted to the rescue. He was  as big and as heavy as the fox, and when he struck Napakasew, it was  with a ferocious snarl that Pierrot might have heard on the farther  side of the pond, and his teeth sank like knives into the shoulder of  Umisk's assailant. The fox was of a breed of forest highwaymen which  kills from behind. He was not a fighter when it came fang-to-fang,  unless cornered--and so fierce and sudden was Baree's assault that  Napakasew took to flight almost as quickly as he had begun his attack  on Umisk.    Baree did not follow him, but went to Umisk, who lay half in the mud,  whimpering and snuffling in a curious sort of way. Gently Baree nosed  him, and after a moment or two Umisk got up on his webbed feet, while  fully twenty or thirty beavers were making a tremendous fuss in the  water near the shore.    After this the beaver pond seemed more than ever like home to Baree.        CHAPTER 11    While lovely Nepeese was still shuddering over her thrilling experience  under the rock--while Pierrot still offered grateful thanks in his  prayers for her deliverance and Baree was becoming more and more a  fixture at the beaver pond--Bush McTaggart was perfecting a little  scheme of his own up at Post Lac Bain, about forty miles north and  west. McTaggart had been factor at Lac Bain for seven years. In the  company's books down in Winnipeg he was counted a remarkably successful  man. The expense of his post was below the average, and his semiannual  report of furs always ranked among the first. After his name, kept on  file in the main office, was one notation which said: \"Gets more out of  a dollar than any other man north of God's Lake.\"    The Indians knew why this was so. They called him Napao Wetikoo--the  man-devil. This was under their breath--a name whispered sinisterly in  the glow of tepee fires, or spoken softly where not even the winds  might carry it to the ears of Bush McTaggart. They feared him; they  hated him. They died of starvation and sickness, and the tighter Bush  McTaggart clenched the fingers of his iron rule, the more meekly, it  seemed to him, did they respond to his mastery. His was a small soul,  hidden in the hulk of a brute, which rejoiced in power. And here--with  the raw wilderness on four sides of him--his power knew no end. The big  company was behind him. It had made him king of a domain in which there  was little law except his own. And in return he gave back to the  company bales and bundles of furs beyond their expectation. It was not  for them to have suspicions. They were a thousand or more miles  away--and dollars were what counted.    Gregson might have told. Gregson was the investigating agent of that  district, who visited McTaggart once each year. He might have reported  that the Indians called McTaggart Napao Wetikoo because he gave them  only half price for their furs. He might have told the company quite  plainly that he kept the people of the trap lines at the edge of  starvation through every month of the winter, that he had them on their  knees with his hands at their throats--putting the truth in a mild and  pretty way--and that he always had a woman or a girl, Indian or  half-breed, living with him at the Post. But Gregson enjoyed his visits  too much at Lac Bain. Always he could count on two weeks of coarse  pleasures. And in addition to that, his own womenfolk at home wore a  rich treasure of fur that came to them from McTaggart.    One evening, a week after the adventure of Nepeese and Baree under the  rock, McTaggart sat under the glow of an oil lamp in his \"store.\" He  had sent his little pippin-faced English clerk to bed, and he was  alone. For six weeks there had been in him a great unrest. It was just  six weeks ago that Pierrot had brought Nepeese on her first visit to  Lac Bain since McTaggart had been factor there. She had taken his  breath away. Since then he had been able to think of nothing but her.  Twice in that six weeks he had gone down to Pierrot's cabin. Tomorrow  he was going again. Marie, the slim Cree girl over in his cabin, he had  forgotten--just as a dozen others before Marie had slipped out of his  memory. It was Nepeese now. He had never seen anything quite so  beautiful as Pierrot's girl.    Audibly he cursed Pierrot as he looked at a sheet of paper under his  hand, on which for an hour or more he had been making notes out of worn  and dusty company ledgers. It was Pierrot who stood in his way.  Pierrot's father, according to those notes, had been a full-blooded  Frenchman. Therefore Pierrot was half "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47519"],[0,"President Heber C. Kimball's Journal (#13)"],[1,"to the same calamities  that have now come upon you. You have always been the aggressors--you  have brought upon yourselves these difficulties, by being disaffected,  and not being subject to rule. And my advice is, that you become as  other citizens, least by a recurrence of these events you bring upon  yourselves irretrievable ruin.\"    He also said, \"You must not be seen as many as five together; if you  are, the citizens will be upon you and destroy you, but you should flee  immediately out of the State. There is no alternative for you but to  flee; you need not expect any redress; there is none for you.\"    I was present when that speech was delivered, and I can truly say that  he is a liar and the truth is not in him, for not one of us had made  any such agreement with Lucas, or any other person. What we did was by  compulsion in every sense of the word; and as for General Clark and his  unknown god, they had nothing to do with our deliverance; but it was  our Father in heaven, the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob, in  whom we trust, who liveth and dwelleth in the heavens; and the day will  come when our God will hold him in derision, with all of his coadjutors.        CHAPTER XII.    PERILS OF THE PEOPLE--CHEERFULNESS OF THE SAINTS AMIDST THEIR  TROUBLES--VISIT OUR BRETHREN IN PRISON--APOSTLES ORDAINED--MOCK  DISTRIBUTION OF STATE APPROPRIATION--LETTER FROM JOSEPH SMITH  AND BRETHREN IN PRISON--INDIFFERENCE OF STATE OFFICIALS TO OUR  APPEALS--WORD OF THE LORD TO ME.    One afternoon, I sent my son William a short distance on an errand,  when, on his return, one of the guards drew up his rifle and threatened  to blow out his brains if he stepped one inch further towards the  house. Through the agency of some of my brethren, I was notified of it.  I went to the man and spoke to him in a friendly manner, and conversed  with him about the beautiful country, it being more beautiful than  England and the nations I had been traveling in.    He became very much interested, and in a short time I pointed out my  son William, who had stood still for some time after being warned not  to approach, and was cold, as it was then dusk and the weather severe.  Said I, \"That is my son.\"    \"Oh!\" he said, \"if that is one of your sons, he may pass; he may go  home.\"    Afterwards the man left his post and came to my house and spent the  evening and several times afterwards, and became very friendly, and  told me he wished I would leave the \"Mormons,\" as he liked me, and  could not bear the thought of my following them with my family, for we  were too good for them.    I merely mention this to show the perils we were in, men, women and  children, with death and destruction waiting on us, and this spirit  aroused by apostates.    The murders, house burnings, robberies, rapes, drivings, whippings,  imprisonments, chainings and other sufferings and cruelties inflicted  upon the people of God under illegal orders of Missouri's executive,  have been only in part laid before the world, and form a page in  history unparalleled in the records of religious persecution. This  historic page alone can credit Lilburn W. Boggs and his minions with  feeding the ministers of the proscribed religion on the flesh of their  murdered brethren, the odium of which crime is shared fully by the  professed ministers of different denominations who participated in  these vile atrocities! If hell can furnish a parallel, where is it?    For me to undertake to write what I saw, and felt and realized, I  should utterly fail for lack of ability; I must let eternity reveal the  scenes of those days. I can say before God, angels, heaven and earth,  that I am innocent of violating any law of the State of Missouri, and  I can say that my brethren are as pure and clean as I am, innocent and  virtuous, true to their God and their country. With the measure they  meted to the Latter-day Saints, it shall be measured to them again, or  upon all those who had a hand in our persecution and expulsion, and  those who consented to it, four fold, full, pressed down, and running  over shall be their portion; and as the Lord God Almighty liveth, I  shall live to see it come to pass. [A]    [Footnote A: Elder Kimball lived to see the fulfillment of this  prophecy.]    When we walked up to sign the deeds of trust to pay these assassins for  murdering our brethren and sisters and their children, ravishing some  of our sisters to death, robbing us of our lands and possessions and  all we had on earth, and other such _services_, they expected to see  us cast down and sorrowful; but I testify as an eye-witness that the  brethren rejoiced and praised the Lord and kicked up their heels, and  thanked God, taking joyfully the despoiling of their goods. There were  judges, magistrates and Methodist, Presbyterian, Campbellite and other  sectarian priests who stood by and saw all this going on, exulting over  us, and it seemed to make them more angry that we bore our misfortunes  so cheerfully. Judge Cameron said, with an oath, \"See them creatures  laugh and kick up their heels! They are whipped but not conquered.\"    I have no doubt that I would have been taken a prisoner had the mob  known me, but I had not been there but three weeks when the mobbing  commenced, and was only known by the brethren, and many of them I  had not seen during my brief residence there. The mob had not become  acquainted with Brother Brigham, either, as he lived three or four  miles from the city on Mill Creek.    After the mob departed, I accompanied Brother Brigham to Richmond  jail to see our brethren. We found Joseph, Hyrum, Sidney and others  chained together in one room, and others confined in other places among  the worst demons living out of hell. We scarcely had the privilege  of speaking to our brethren more than to say, \"How do you do?\" every  eye being upon us with suspicion. We put up at a public house for  the night, and I bear testimony, from our feelings and the spirit  manifested in that house, that there were legions of devils present. I  do not think that either of us slept any that night.    On the 13th of December, Elder Brigham Young and I reorganized the High  Council at Far West, when we expressed our fellowship with all those  who desired to do right, and filled the vacancies occasioned by those  brethren who had to flee from Missouri to save their lives.    On the 19th of December, 1838, Brother Brigham and I ordained Elders  John Taylor and John E. Page Apostles.    The legislature of the State of Missouri appropriated two thousand  dollars, to be distributed among the people of Daviess and Caldwell  Counties, the \"Mormons\" not excepted. Judge Cameron, Mr. McHenry and  others attended to the distribution. Judge Cameron drove in the hogs  belonging to the brethren (many of which were identified), shot them  down in the street, and without further bleeding, they were half  dressed, cut up and distributed by Mr. McHenry to the poor, at the rate  of four and five cents per pound, which, together with a few pieces  of refuse calicoes at double and treble prices, soon consumed the  appropriation.    I received the following letter from the Prophet and his brethren while  they were in prison.    \"LIBERTY,    \"Jan. 16th, 1839.    \"BROTHERS H. C. KIMBALL AND B. YOUNG:    \"_Joseph Smith, Jun., Sidney Rigdon and Hyrum Smith, prisoners for  Jesus' sake, send greeting_:--In obedience to your request in your  letter, we say to you as follows: It is not wisdom for you to go out  of Caldwell with your families yet for a little season; until we are  out of prison; after which you may act at your pleasure; but though you  take your families out of the State, it will be necessary for you to  return, and leave as before designed, on the 26th of April.    \"Inasmuch as we are in prison, for a little season, if need be, the  management of the affairs of the Church devolves on you, that is the  Twelve.    \"The gathering of necessity is stopped; but the conversion of the world  need not stop, but under wise management can go on more rapidly than  ever.    \"Where churches are built, let them continue where they are, until  a door is open to do otherwise, and let every Elder occupy his own  ground, and when he builds a church, let him preside over it, and let  not others run in to trouble him; and thus let every man prove himself  unto God, that he is worthy. If we live, we live; and if we die for the  testimony of Jesus, we die; but whether we live or die, let the work of  God go on.    \"Let the churches in England continue there till further orders--till a  door can be opened for them, except they choose to come to America, and  take their chance with the Saints here. If they will do that, let them  come; and if they choose to come, they would do well to send their wise  men before them, and buy out Kirtland, and the regions round about, or  they may settle where they can till things may alter.    \"It will be necessary for you to get the Twelve together, ordain such  as have not been ordained, or at least such of them as you can get,  and proceed to regulate the Elders as the Lord may give you wisdom. We  nominate George A. Smith and Lyman Sherman to take the places of Orson  Hyde and Thomas B. Marsh.    \"Brethren, fear not, but be strong in the Lord and in the power of His  might. What is man that the servant of God should fear him, or the  son of man, that he should tremble at him. Neither think it strange  concerning the fiery trials with which we are tried, as though some  strange thing had happened unto us. Remember that all have been  partakers of like afflictions. Therefore, rejoice in our afflictions,  by which you are perfected and through which the Captain of our  Salvation was perfected also. Let your hearts and the hearts of all  the Saints be comforted with you, and let them rejoice exceedingly,  for great is our reward in heaven, for so the wicked persecuted the  prophets which "]]]
