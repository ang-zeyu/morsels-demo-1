I don't  think much of that fellow Hammond. He's too good to be true.\"    \"What have we here?\" whispered Hippy to Nora under cover of general  conversation. \"I never before saw so many spingles and spangles  collected in one spot.\"    \"Sh-h-h!\" pleaded Nora. \"Don't make me laugh, Hippy. Marian is looking  this way, and she'll be awfully cross if she thinks we are making sport  of her.\"    \"She reminds me of a song I once heard in a show which went something  like this,\" and Hippy naughtily sang under his breath:        \"My well-beloved circus queen,      My human snake, my Angeline!\"    There was a queer choking sound from Nora and she walked quickly down to  the other end of the drawing room and earnestly fixed her gaze upon a  portrait of one of the judge's ancestors, until she could gain control  of her risibles.    The dinner was a memorable one to both the judge and his guests, and it  was after nine o'clock before the last toast had been drunk in fruit  punch. Then every one repaired again to the drawing room.    Shortly after, Grace, Anne, Nora, Jessica, Eva and Miriam, accompanied  by David, Tom, Hippy and Reddy disappeared, closing the massive doors  between the drawing room and the wide hall. Half an hour later Arnold  Evans announced that all those wishing to attend the pantomime, \"The  Mistletoe Bough,\" could obtain front seats in the hall.    There was a general rush for the hall where the spectators found rows of  chairs arranged at one end.    Hardly had they seated themselves when the first notes of that quaint  old ballad, \"The Mistletoe Bough,\" sounded from the piano in the drawing  room, Nora O'Malley appeared in the archway, and in her clear, sweet  voice sang the first verse of the song.    As she finished, the strains of a wedding march were heard, and from the  room at the opposite side of the hall came a wedding procession.    Anne, as the bride, was attired in an old-time, short-waisted gown of  white satin with a long lace veil, yellow with age, while David in a  square-cut costume with powdered wig, enacted the part of the  bridegroom. Arnold Evans was the clergyman, Grace and Tom the parents of  the bride, while Reddy, Jessica, Hippy and Eva were the wedding guests.    All were garbed in the fashion of \"ye olden time,\" the boys in wigs and  square cuts, the girls in short-waisted, low-necked gowns, with hair  combed high and powdered.    Then the ceremony was performed in pantomime and the bride and groom  received the congratulations of their friends. The groom bowed low over  the bride's hand and led her to the center of the hall. The other  couples formed in line behind them and a stately minuet was danced.    While the minuet was in progress the bride suddenly stopped in the midst  of the figure and professing weariness of the dance, ran out of the  room, after signifying to her husband and guests that she would hide,  and after a brief interval they should seek for her.    Entering into her fun, the young husband and guests smilingly lingered a  moment after her departure, and then ran eagerly off to find her. This  closed the scene, and Nora again appeared and sang the next verse.    The cedar chest, brought from the attic by the boys, had been set on the  broad landing at the turn of the open staircase, and in the next scene  Anne appeared, alone, and discovering the chest climbed gleefully into  it and drew the lid down.    Then followed the vain search for her and the deep despair of the young  husband at the failure to find his bride, with the final departure of  the wedding guests, their joy changed to sorrow over the bride's  mysterious disappearance.    There was a brief wait until the next scene, during which another verse  of the ballad was sung. Then the husband, grown old, appeared and in  pantomime reviewed the story of the strange vanishing of his beautiful  bride on her wedding night so many years before. In the next scene two  servants appeared with orders to clean out and remove the old chest from  the landing. Hippy and Jessica, as the two mischievous prying servants,  enacted their part to perfection. Hippy carrying a broom and dust pan,  did one of the eccentric dances, for which he was famous, while Jessica,  armed with a huge duster, tried to drive him to work.    Finally both lay hold of the old chest, the rusted lock broke and the  lid flew open. After one look both servants ran away in terror, and  beckoned to the forsaken husband who had appeared in the meantime,  seating himself on the oak settee in the lower hall. With eager gestures  they motioned him to the landing where the old chest stood. The final  tableau, depicted the stricken husband on his knees beside the chest  with a portion of the wedding veil in his shaking hands, while the  servants, ignorant of the story of the lost bride, looked on in wonder.    During the last tableau Nora softly sang the closing verse and the  refrain. Even after the last note had died away the spectators sat  perfectly still for a moment. Then the applause burst forth and David  bowing in acknowledgment, turned and helped Anne out of the chest, where  she had lain quietly after hiding.    The chest had been set with the side that opened toward the wall. While  planning for the pantomime the boys had arranged the lid so that it did  not close, yet the opening was not perceptible to those seated below.  Thus there had been no danger of Anne meeting the fate of the  ill-starred Ginevra, the heroine of the ballad.    \"You clever children,\" cried the old judge. \"How did you ever get up  anything like that on such short notice? It was beautifully done. I have  always been very fond of 'The Mistletoe Bough.' My sister used to sing  it for me.\"    \"Grace thought of it,\" said Anne. \"We found all those costumes up in the  garret in the old cedar chest. We knew the story by heart, and we knew  the minuet. We danced it at an entertainment in Oakdale last winter. We  had a very short rehearsal this afternoon in the garret and that's all.\"    \"Anne arranged the scenes and coached David in his part of the  pantomime,\" said Grace. \"She did more than I.\"    The judge's guests, also, added their tribute of admiration to that of  the judge.    \"It was all so real. I could scarcely refrain from telling that poor  young husband where his bride had hidden herself,\" laughed one old  gentleman.    \"Why don't you children have a little dance?\" asked the judge. \"This  hall ought to make a good ball room, and you can take turns at the  piano.\"    \"Oh, may we, Judge?\" cried Grace in delight. \"I am simply dying to have  a good waltz on this floor.\"    \"I'll play for you for a while,\" volunteered Miriam, \"then Eva and  Jessica can take my place.\"    Five minutes later the young folks were gliding about the big hall to  the strains of a Strauss' waltz, while the judge and his friends looked  on, taking an almost melancholy pleasure in the gay scene of youthful  enjoyment.    \"Will you dance the next waltz with me, Miss Harlowe!\" said Henry  Hammond to Grace, as she sat resting after a two-step.    After a second's hesitation Grace replied in the affirmative. Despite  her resolve to make peace with him, up to that moment Grace had been  unable to bring herself to the point of speaking pleasantly to him.    The waltz began, and as they glided around the room she was obliged to  acknowledge herself that Henry Hammond's dancing left nothing to be  desired.    \"Perhaps my impressions of him are unjust, after all,\" thought Grace. \"I  suppose I have no right to criticize him so severely, even though he was  rude to me the other night. I was rude, too. Perhaps he will turn out--\"    But Grace's reflections were cut short by her partner, who had stopped  in the center of the hall.    \"Miss Harlowe,\" he said with a disagreeable smile, \"you are standing  directly under the mistletoe. I suppose you know the penalty.\"    Grace looked at him with flashing eyes. \"Mr. Hammond,\" she replied,  flushing angrily, \"you purposely halted under the mistletoe, and if for  one minute you think that you can take advantage of a foolish tradition  by so doing you are mistaken. When we girls coaxed Judge Putnam under  the mistletoe the other night, it was merely with the view of offering a  pretty courtesy to an elderly gentleman. None of our boys would think of  being so silly, and I want you to distinctly understand that not one of  our crowd is given to demonstrations of that sort.\"    \"Miss Harlowe,\" replied Henry Hammond between his teeth, \"you are an  insolent, ill-bred young woman, and it is plain to be seen that you are  determined to misconstrue my every action and incur my enmity. So be it,  but let me warn you that my hatred is no light matter.\"    \"Your friendship or your enmity are a matter of equal indifference to  me, Mr. Hammond,\" answered Grace, and with a cool nod she crossed the  room and joined Nora and Hippy, who were sitting on the stairs playing  cats' cradle with the long silver chain of Nora's fan.          CHAPTER XIII    TOM AND GRACE SCENT TROUBLE      The time passed all too rapidly, and with many expressions of regret on  both sides the judge and his youthful guests parted, two days before the  New Year.    On account of the house party the Phi Sigma Tau had been obliged to  postpone until New Year's Day entertaining as they had done the previous  year the stray High School girls who were far from home. Therefore, the  moment they arrived in Oakdale they found their hands full.

An open shore stretching to the river occupies the background.  Rocky heights enclose the shore. Gunther and Gutrune on a throne at one  side, before which stands a table with drinking-vessels on it. In front  of this Hagen is seated._    GUNTHER        Give ear, Hagen;      Tell me the truth:  Is my fame on the Rhine  Worthy of Gibich's son?    HAGEN        I envy thee      Thy fame and thy glory;  Thy great renown was foretold  To me by Grimhild' our mother.    GUNTHER        I envy thee,      So envy not me.  I, as first-born, rule,  But the wisdom is thine.  Half-brother's feud  Could scarce be laid better;  Asking thus of my renown,  'Tis thy wisdom that I praise.    HAGEN        My words I withdraw,      Thy fame might be more:  I know of precious treasures  That the Gibichung has not yet won.    GUNTHER        Hide these, and I      Withdraw my praise.    HAGEN    In summer's full-ripened glory  Blooms the Gibich stock,  Thou, Gunther, still unwived,  Thou, Gutrun', still unwed.    GUNTHER    Whom wouldst thou have me woo,  To win more wide renown?    HAGEN        One I know of,      None nobler in the world.  She dwells on soaring rocks,  Her chamber is circled by fire;  And he who would Brünnhild' woo  Must break through the daunting flame.    GUNTHER    Suffices my strength for the task?    HAGEN    For one stronger still it is decreed.    GUNTHER    Who is that hero unmatched?    HAGEN    Siegfried, the Wälsung's son;  He is the hero bold.      A twin-born pair,      Whom fate turned to lovers,      Siegmund and Sieglinde,  Had as their offspring this child.  In the woods he grew and waxed strong.  'Tis he that Gutrun' must wed.    GUTRUNE [_Shyly._    Tell me what deed of high valour  Made this hero the first in renown.    HAGEN        At Neidhöhle      A huge dragon lay,  Who guarded the Nibelung's gold.      He was slain,      And his horrid jaws closed  By Siegfried's invincible sword.  From this colossal deed  The fame of the hero dawned.    GUNTHER [_Thoughtfully._    They say that a priceless treasure  The Niblungs had in their hoard.    HAGEN    The man who could use its spell  Were lord of the world evermore.    GUNTHER    And Siegfried won it in fight?    HAGEN    He has the Niblungs in thrall.    GUNTHER    And Brünnhild' no other can win?    HAGEN    To no other will the flames yield.    GUNTHER [_Rises angrily from his seat._    Why wake dissension and doubt?  Why stir up my desire      And yearning for joys      That cannot be won?            [_He walks to and fro much agitated._    Hagen            [_Without leaving his seat causes Gunther to pull          up as he approaches him, by a gesture of mysterious          import._        Would not Brünnhilde      Be thy bride,  Were she by Siegfried brought home?    GUNTHER            [_Turns away doubtful and angry._    But how could I force this man  To woo the bride for me?    Hagen [_As before._    Thy simple prayer would force him,  Gutrun' winning him first.    GUTRUNE    Thou mockest, cruel Hagen!  What arts have I to bind him?      The greatest hero      In all the world  Has long ere this by the fairest  Women on earth been loved.    HAGEN            [_Bending confidentially towards Gutrune._    What of the drink in the chest?            [_More secretly._    In me who won it have more faith.  To thee in love it will bind  Him whom thy heart most desires.            [_Gunther has come to the table again, and, leaning          against it, pays close attention._    Hither did Siegfried come,  And taste of this potion of herbs,  He would straight forget he had looked  On any woman before,  Or been by woman approached.      Now answer:  Think ye my counsel good?    GUNTHER [_Starting up suddenly._        Now Grimhild' be praised,      Who for brother gave us thee.    GUTRUNE    Siegfried fain I would behold!    GUNTHER    But how can he be found?            [_A horn on the stage, from the background on the          left, very loud but distant._    HAGEN            [_Listens and turns to Gunther._        Merrily hunting      After renown      Across the world      As through a wood,  Belike in his chase he will come,  To the Gibich's realm on the Rhine.    GUNTHER    Heartily welcome were he.            [_A horn on the stage, nearer, but still distant.          Both listen._    A horn from the Rhine I hear.    HAGEN            [_Looks down the river and calls towards the back._    A man and horse on board a boat!  His horn how gaily he winds!            [_A horn on the stage sounds nearer. Gunther stops          half-way listening._        See the leisurely stroke,      And the indolent arm      Against the stream      Urging the boat!      So skilful a hand      On the swinging oar      Can be but his      Who the dragon slew:--  It is Siegfried--surely no other!    GUNTHER        Will he go by?    HAGEN            [_Making a trumpet of his hands, calls towards the          river._    Hoiho! Blithe hero,  Whither bound?    SIEGFRIED [_From the distance._    I seek the son of Gibich.    HAGEN    I bid thee welcome to Gunther's hall.            [_Siegfried in a boat appears at the shore._    This way! Stop here and land!            _Siegfried brings his boat to the shore. Hagen          makes it fast with the chain. Siegfried springs          ashore with his horse. Gunther has come down and          joined Hagen._    HAGEN    Hail, Siegfried, hero bold!            [_Gutrune gazes at Siegfried from the throne          in astonishment. Gunther prepares to offer him          friendly greetings. All stand fixed in silent          mutual contemplation._    SIEGFRIED            [_Leaning on his horse, remains quietly standing by          the boat._    Who is Gibich's son?    GUNTHER    I am he thou dost seek.    SIEGFRIED        Thy fame has reached me      From the Rhine;      Now fight with me,      Or be my friend.    GUNTHER        Be thou mine;      Thou art welcome!    SIEGFRIED        Where stable my horse?    HAGEN        Leave him to me.    SIEGFRIED [_Turning to Hagen._        My name thou knowest;      Where have we met?    HAGEN        I guessed from thy strength      Who thou must be.    SIEGFRIED            [_As he hands over the horse to Hagen._        Be careful of Grane,      For thou hast never      Led by the rein      So noble a steed.            [_Hagen leads the horse away. While Siegfried looks          thoughtfully after him, Gutrune, obeying a sign of          Hagen's which Siegfried does not notice, goes to          her room through a door on the left. Gunther comes          into the hall with Siegfried, whom he has invited          to accompany him._    GUNTHER    My father's ancient hall,  O hero, greet in gladness!      All thou beholdest,      Where'er thou art,  Treat as thine own henceforward:      Thine is my kingdom--      Land and folk;  By my body I swear it!  Yea, myself I am thine.    SIEGFRIED    Nor land nor folk have I to give,  Nor father's house nor hall;      In my body      Is all my wealth;  As I live it grows less.      But a sword have I      Which I welded;  Let my sword be my witness!--  That and myself I bestow.    HAGEN            [_Who has come back and now stands behind Siegfried._    Of the Nibelungs' treasure  Rumour names thee the lord.    SIEGFRIED            [_Turning round to Hagen._    I almost forgot the hoard,  So lightly I prize its worth.  I left it lying in a cavern,  Where a dragon once held watch.    HAGEN    And nothing took at all?    SIEGFRIED    Only this, not knowing its use.    HAGEN    It is the Tarnhelm,  The gem of the Nibelung's art;  Its use, when worn on thy head,  Is to change thy shape as thou wilt;  If fain to be borne afar,  In a flash lo! thou art there!  Didst thou take nothing besides?    SIEGFRIED    Yes, a ring.    HAGEN        Which safe thou dost hold?    SIEGFRIED [_Tenderly._    'Tis held by a woman fair.    HAGEN [_Aside._        Brünnhild'!    GUNTHER    Nay, Siegfried, let us not barter;  All I have a bauble poor,  Matched with thy treasure, would be.  I will serve thee without reward.            [_Hagen has gone to Gutrune's door, and now opens          it._    GUTRUNE            [_Enters carrying a full drinking-horn, with which          she approaches Siegfried._        Welcome, O guest,      To Gibich's house!  'Tis his daughter gives thee to drink.
