For thei neither  thincke it mete, that any parte of the honour of the Goddes should bee  omitted, or that thei, whiche are Ministres of the commune counsaill and  profecte, should be destitute of necessary commodities of the life. For  these menne are alwaie in matters of weighte, called vpon by the nobles,  for their wisedome and counsaille: And to shewe (as thei can by their  connyng in the Planettes, and Starres, and by the maner of their  Sacrifices) the happe of thinges to come. Thei also declare vnto them, the  stories of men of olde tyme, regested in their holy Scripture, to the ende  that accordyng to them the kynges maie learne what shall profighte, or  disprofighte. For the maner is not emong them, as it is emong the Grecians,  that one manne, or one woman, shoulde attende vpon the sacrifices and  Ceremonies alone: but thei are many at ones aboute the honour of their  Goddes, and teache the same ordre to their children. This sorte of menne is  priuileged, and exempte from all maner of charges, and hath next vnto the  kyng, the second place of dignitie and honour.    The second portion cometh to the king to maintein his owne state, and the  charges of the warres: and to shewe liberalitie to men of prowesse  according to their worthinesse. So that the Communes are neither burdoned  with taxes nor tributes.    The thirde parte do the pencionaries of the warres receiue, and suche other  as vpon occasions are moustered to the warres: that vpon the regard of the  stipende, thei maie haue the better good wille and courage, to hasarde  their bodies in battaile. Their communaltie is deuided into thre sortes of  people. Husbande men, Brieders of cattle, and men of occupacion. The  Husband-men buyeng for a litle money a piece of grounde of the Priestes,  the king, or the warriour: al the daies of their life, euen from their  childhode, continually applie that care. Whereby it cometh to passe, that  bothe for the skoolyng that thei haue therin at their fathers handes, and  the continuall practisyng fro their youthe, that thei passe all other in  Husbandrie.    The Brieders, aftre like maner, learnyng the trade of their fathers,  occupie their whole life therabout. We see also that al maner of Sciences  haue bene much bettred, yea, brought to the toppe of perfection, emong the  Egiptians. For the craftes men there, not medlyng with any commune matiers  that mighte hindre theim, emploie them selues onely to suche sciences as  the lawe doeth permit them, or their father hath taught them. So that thei  neither disdaine to be taughte, nor the hatred of eche other, ne any thing  elles withdraweth them from their crafte.    Their Iudgementes and Sentences of lawe, are not there at giuen aduenture,  but vpon reason: for thei surely thought that all thinges well done, muste  niedes be profitable to mannes life. To punishe the offendours, and to  helpe the oppressed, thoughte thei the best waie to auoide mischiefes. But  to buye of the punishmente for money or fauour, that thought thei to be the  very confusion of the commune welfare. Wherefore thei chase out of the  chief cities (as Heliopole, Memphis, and Thebes) the worthiest men, to be  as Lordes chief Iustice, or Presidentes of Iudgementes, so that their  Iustice benche did sieme to giue place, neither to the Areopagites of the  Athenienses, ne yet to the Senate of the Lacedemonians that many a daie  after theim ware instituted. Aftre what tyme these chief Iustices ware  assembled (thirtie in nombre) thei chase out one that was Chauncellour of  the whole: and when he failed, the citie appoincted another in his place.  All these had their liuynges of the kyng: but the Chauncellour more  honorably then the rest. He bare alwaie about his necke a tablette, hangyng  on a chaine of golde, and sette full of sundrie precious stones, whiche  thei called Veritie and Truthe. The courte beyng set and begunne, and the  tablet of Truthe by the Chauncellour laied furthe, and theight bookes of  their lawes (for so many had thei) brought furth into the middes emong  them: it was the maner for the plaintife to putte into writyng the whole  circumstance of his case, and the maner of the wrong doone vnto him, or how  muche he estemed himself to be endamaged thereby. And a time was giuen to  the defendant to write answere again to euery poinct, and either to deny  that he did it, or elles to alledge that he rightfully did it, or elles to  abate the estimate of the damage or wrong. Then had thei another daie  appointed, to saie finally for them selues. At the whiche daie when the  parties on bothe sides ware herd, and the iudges had conferred their  opinions, the Chauncellour of the Iudges gaue sentence by pointyng with the  tablet of Veritie, toward the parte that semed to be true. This was the  maner of their iudgementes.    And forasmuche as we are fallen into mencion of their iudgementes, it shall  not be vnfyttyng with myne enterprise, to write also the aunciente Lawes of  the Egiptians, that it maie be knowen how muche they passe, bothe in ordre  of thynges, and profite.    Fyrst to be periured was headyng: for they thought it a double offence. One  in regarde of conscience not kept toward God, and an other in gyuynge  occasion to destroy credite among men, whiche is the chiefest bonde of  their felowship. If any wayfarying man shuld espy a man sette vppon with  thieues, or otherwyse to be wronged, and dyd not to his power succour and  ayde hym, he was gyltie of death. If he ware not able to succour and to  reskewe hym, then was he bounde to vtter the thieues, and to prosecute the  matter to enditement. And he that so dyd not, was punyshed with a certayne  nombre of stripes, and was kept thre days without meate. He that shuld  accuse any man wrongfully, if he fortuned afterward to be broughte into  iudgement, he suffered the punishement ordeyned for false accusers. All the  Egyptians ware compelled to brynge euery man their names to the chiefe  Iustices, and the facultie or science wherby they liued. In the which  behalfe if any man lyed, or lyued with vnlaufull meanes, he felle into  penalitie of death. If any man willyngly had slaine any man free or bond,  the lawes condemned hym to die, not regardynge the state of the man, but  the malicious pourpose of the diede. Wherby they made men afrayd to doe  mischief, and death beynge executed for the death of a bondman, the free  myght goe in more sauftie. For the fathers that slewe their chyldren, there  was no punyshement of death appoynted, but an iniunction that they shoulde  stande thre daies and thre nyghtes togither at the graue of the deade,  accompanied with a common warde of the people to see the thyng done.  Neyther dyd it sieme them iuste, that he that gaue life to the childe,  should lose his life for the childes death, but rather be put to continual  sorowe, and to be pyned with the repentance of the diede, that other myght  ther by the withdrawen from the like wyckednes. But for the chyld that  kylled either father or mother, they deuised this kynd of synguler torment.  They thruste hym through with riedes sharpned for the nones, in euery ioynt  all ouer his body, and caused hym quicke to be throwen vpon a heape of  Thornes, and so to bee burned. Iudgyng that there could not be a greater  wickednes emong men, then to take awaie the life, from one that had giuen  life vnto hym. If any woman with child ware condempned to dye, thei abode  the tyme of her deliueraunce nowithstandyng: for that thei iudged it farre  from all equitie, that the gilteles should dye together with the giltie. Or  that ii. should be punished, where but one had offended. Who so had in  battaille or warre, withdrawen hymself from his bande, forsaken his place  in the arraie, or not obeied his capitaigne: was not condempned to dye, but  suffred for his punishemente a notable reproche, of all punishementes the  woorste, and more greuous then death. Who so had disclosed any secret to  the ennemie, the Lawe commaunded his tongue to be cutte out of his heade.  And who so clipped the coigne or countrefacted it, or chaunged the stampe  or diminisshed the weighte: or in lettres and writinges, shoulde adde any  thing, by entrelinyng, or otherwise: or should guelde out any thyng, or  bryng a forged euidence, Obligacion or Bille, bothe his handes ware cutte  of. That suche parte of the bodie as had offended, mighte for euer beare  the punishemente therof: and the residue takyng warnyng by his ensample,  might shonne the like.    There ware also sharpe punishementes constitute, in offences concernyng  women. For he that had defloured a free woman, had his membres cutte of,  because in one offence, he had committed thre no small wickednesses. That  is to saie, wrong, made the woman an whore, and broughte in a doubte the  laufulnes of her issue. But thei that ware taken in adulterie, bothe partes  byeng agreed, the man was whipped with a thousand stripes by tale: and the  woman had her nose cut of, wherwith beside the shame she had, the whole  beautie of her face was disgraced, and disfigured.    The Lawes that apperteigned to the trade and occupieng of men, one with  another: ware made (as thei saie) by one Bocchorides. It is commaunded in  them, that if money haue bene lent any manne without writyng, vppon credite  of his woorde: if the borrower deny it, he should be put to his othe, to  the whiche the creditour muste stande. For thei so muche estiemed an othe,  that thei thoughte no man so wicked, as wilfully to abuse it. And again,  because he that was noted to sweare very often, lost vtterly his credite,  and name: many menne affirme, that for the regard of their honesties, it  happened very seldome, that any man came to his othe. Their Lawe maker  also, iudging that vertue was the engendrer of credite, thought it good by  good ordres to accustome men to good liuyng and honestie, vpon feare to  sieme vnworthie of all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8112"],[0,"Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines (#13)"],[1,"advanced  them materially in their onward progress toward the higher condition  of the Village Indians. Numerous tribes were thus raised out of  savagery into barbarism by appropriating the arts of life of tribes  above them. This process has been a constant phenomenon in the  history of the human race. It is well illustrated in America, where  the Red Race, one in origin and possessed of homogeneous institutions,  were in three different ethnical conditions or stages of culture.    There are certain usages and customs of the Indian tribes generally  which tend to explain their plan of life--their large households,  their houses, and their house architecture. They deserve a careful  consideration and even further investigation beyond the bounds of  our present knowledge. The influence of American civilization has  very generally broken up their old plan of life, and introduced a  new one more analogous to our own. It has been much the same in  Spanish America. The old usages and customs, in the particulars  about to be stated, have now so far disappeared in their pure forms  that their recovery is not free from difficulty. Those to be  considered are the following:    I. The law of hospitality.    II. Communism in living.    III. The ownership of lands in common.    IV. The practice of having but one prepared meal each day--a dinner.    V. Their separation at meals, the men eating first and by themselves,  and the women and children afterwards.    The discussion will be confined to the period of European discovery  and to later periods while these practices remained. The object will  be to show that these usages and customs existed among them when  America was discovered in its several parts, and that they remained  in practice for some time after these several periods.        THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY.    Among the Iroquois hospitality was an established usage. If a man  entered an Indian house in any of their villages, whether a villager,  a tribesman, or a stranger, it was the duty of the women therein to  set food before him. An omission to do this would have been a  discourtesy amounting to an affront. If hungry, he ate; if not hungry,  courtesy required that he should taste the food and thank the giver.  This would be repeated at every house he entered, and at whatever  hour in the day. As a custom it was upheld by a rigorous public  sentiment. The same hospitality was extended to strangers from their  own and from other tribes. Upon the advent of the European race  among them it was also extended to them. This characteristic of  barbarous society, wherein food was the principal concern of life,  is a remarkable fact. The law of hospitality, as administered by the  American aborigines, tended to the final equalization of subsistence.  Hunger and destitution could not exist at one end of an Indian  village or in one section of an encampment while plenty prevailed  elsewhere in the same village or encampment. It reveals a plan of  life among them at the period of European discovery which has not  been sufficiently considered.    A singular illustration of the powerful influence of the custom upon  the Indian mind came to my notice some years ago at the Seneca  Reservation in New York. A Seneca chief, well to do in the world,  with farm lands and domestic animals which afforded him a  comfortable subsistence, had lost his wife by death, and his daughter,  educated in the usages of civilized life, took the position of  housekeeper. The old man, referring to the ancient custom, requested  his daughter to keep the usual food constantly prepared ready to  offer to any person who entered their house, saying that he did not  wish to see this custom of their forefathers laid aside. Their  changed condition, and particularly the adoption of the regular  meals of civilized society, for the time of which the visitor might  reasonably be expected to wait, did not in his mind outweigh the  sanctity of the custom. [Footnote: William Parker was the chief named,  a noble specimen of a Seneca Iroquois.]    In July, 1743, John Bartram made a journey from Philadelphia to  Onondaga to attend, with Conrad Weisar, a council of the Onondaga,  Mohawk, Oneida, and Cayuga chiefs. At Shamokin he quartered with a  trader who had an Indian wife, and at a village of the Delawares.  \"As soon as we alighted,\" he remarks, \"they showed us where to lay  our luggage, and then brought us a bowl of boiled squashes, cold.  This I then thought poor entertainment, but before I came back I had  learned not to despise good Indian food. This hospitality is  agreeable to the honest simplicity of ancient times, and is so  persistently adhered to that not only what is already dressed is  immediately set before a traveler, but the most pressing business is  postponed to prepare the best they can get for him, keeping it as a  maxim that he must always be hungry. Of this we found the good  effects in the flesh and bread they got ready for us.\" [Footnote:  Bartram's Observations, &c, London edition, 1751, p. 16.] We have  here a perfect illustration among the Delawares of the Iroquois rule  to set food before a person when he first entered the house.  Although they had in this case nothing better than boiled squash to  offer, it was done immediately, after which they commenced preparing  a more substantial repast. Delaware and Iroquois usages were the same.    The council at Onondaga lasted two days, at the close of which they  had each day a dinner in common. \"This council [first day] was  followed by a feast. After four o'clock we all dined together upon  four great kettles of Indian-corn soup, which we emptied, and then  every chief retired to his home.... The conference [second day] held  till three, after which we dined. The repast consisted of three  great kettles of Indian-corn soup, or thin hominy, with dried eels  and other fish boiled in it, and one kettle full of young squashes  and their flowers boiled in water, and a little meal mixed. This  dish was but weak food. Last of all was served a great bowl-full of  Indian dumplings made of new soft corn cut or scraped off the ear,  with the addition of some boiled beans, lapped well in Indian-corn  leaves. This is good hearty provision.\" [Footnote: Bartram's  Journal p. 59.]    \"Again,\" he remarks, \"we prepared for setting forward, and many of  the chiefs came once more to make their farewells. Some of them  brought us provisions for our journey. We shook hands again and set  out at nine.\" [Footnote: ib. p. 63]    One of the earliest notices of the hospitality of the Indian tribes  of the United States was by the expedition of Philip Amidas and  Arthur Barlow, under the auspices of Sir Walter Raleigh, which  visited the Algonkin tribes of North Carolina in the summer of 1584.  They landed at the Island of Wocoken, off Albemarle Sound, when  \"there came down from all parts great store of people,\" whose chief  was Granganimeo. \"He was very just of his promises, for oft we  trusted him, and would come within his day to keep his word. He sent  us commonly every day a brace of ducks, conies, hares, and fish,  sometimes melons, walnuts, cucumbers, pease, and divers roots....  After this acquaintance, myself, with seven more, went thirty miles  into the river Occam, that runneth toward the city Skicoack, and the  evening following we came to an isle called Roanoak, from the harbor  where we entered seven leagues: At the north end were nine houses,  builded with cedar, fortified round with sharp trees [palisaded] and  the entrance like a turnpike [turnspit]. When we came towards it,  the wife of Granganimeo came running out to meet us (her husband was  absent) commanding her people to draw our boat ashore for beating on  the billows. Others she appointed to carry us on their backs aland,  others to bring our oars into the house for stealing. When we came  into the other room (for there were five in the house) she caused us  to sit down by a great fire; and after took off our clothes and  washed them, of some our stockins, and some our feet in warm water,  and she herself took much pains to see all things well ordered and  to provide us victuals. After we had thus dried ourselves she  brought us into an inner room, where she sat on the board standing  along the house, somewhat like frumenty, sodden venison and roasted  fish; in like manner melons raw, boiled roots, and fruits of divers  kinds. Their drink is commonly water boiled with ginger, sometimes  with sassafras, and wholesome herbs.... A more kind, loving people  cannot be. Beyond this isle is the main land, and the great river  Occam, on which standeth a town called Pomeiok.\" [Footnote: Smith's  History of Virginia, &c. Reprint from London edition of 1627.  Richmond edition, 1819, i, 83, 84. Amidas and Barlow's account is  also in Hakluyt's Coll. of Voyages, iii, 301-7.]    This is about the first, if not the first, English picture we have  of Indian life and of English and Indian intercourse in America. It  is highly creditable to both parties; to the Indians for their  unaffected kindness and hospitality, and to the English for their  appreciation of both, and for the absence of any act of injustice.  At the same time it was simply an application by the natives of  their rules of hospitality among themselves to their foreign visitors,  and not a new thing in their experience.    In the narrative of the expedition of Hernando de Soto to Florida in  1539, by a gentleman of Elvas, there are references to the customs  of the Indian tribes of South Carolina, the Cherokees, Choctas, and  Chickasas, and of some of the tribes west of the Mississippi, whom  the expedition visited one after another. They are brief and  incomplete, but sufficiently indicate the point we are attempting to  illustrate. It was a hostile rather than a friendly visitation, and  the naturally free hospitality of the natives was frequently checked  and turned into enmity, but many"]]]
