And he said,             Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?    01:027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him             thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for             servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and             what shall I do now unto thee, my son?    01:027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my             father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted             up his voice, and wept.    01:027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy             dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of             heaven from above;    01:027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;             and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,             that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.    01:027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his             father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of             mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my             brother Jacob.    01:027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:             and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto             him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort             himself, purposing to kill thee.    01:027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to             Laban my brother to Haran;    01:027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn             away;    01:027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget             that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch             thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in             one day?    01:027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of             the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters             of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,             what good shall my life do me?    01:028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and             said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of             Canaan.    01:028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's             father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of             Laban thy mother's brother.    01:028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and             multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;    01:028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy             seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou             art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.    01:028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto             Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,             Jacob's and Esau's mother.    01:028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away             to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he             blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take             a wife of the daughers of Canaan;    01:028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone             to Padanaram;    01:028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac             his father;    01:028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he             had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister             of Nebajoth, to be his wife.    01:028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.    01:028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all             night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of             that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that             place to sleep.    01:028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and             the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God             ascending and descending on it.    01:028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD             God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land             whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;    01:028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt             spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,             and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the             families of the earth be blessed.    01:028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places             whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land;             for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have             spoken to thee of.    01:028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the             LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.    01:028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this             is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of             heaven.    01:028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone             that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,             and poured oil upon the top of it.    01:028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of             that city was called Luz at the first.    01:028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and             will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to             eat, and raiment to put on,    01:028:021 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall             the LORD be my God:    01:028:022 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's             house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give             the tenth unto thee.    01:029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the             people of the east.    01:029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there             were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well             they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's             mouth.    01:029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the             stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put             the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.    01:029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they             said, Of Haran are we.    01:029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And             they said, We know him.    01:029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:             and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.    01:029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that             the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,             and go and feed them.    01:029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered             together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth;             then we water the sheep.    01:029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her             father's sheep; for she kept them.    01:029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of             Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his             mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone             from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his             mother's brother.    01:029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.    01:029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and             that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.    01:029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his             sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and             kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban             all these things.    01:029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.             And he abode with him the space of a month.    01:029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,             shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what             shall thy wages be?    01:029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,             and the name of the younger was Rachel.    01:029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well             favoured.    01:029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven             years for Rachel thy younger daughter.    01:029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than             that I should give her to another man: abide with me.    01:029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto             him but a few days, for the love he had to her.    01:029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are             fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.    01:029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made             a feast.    01:029:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8003"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 3: Leviticus (#13)"],[1,"unto it, and shall give it unto the             priest with the holy thing.    03:022:015 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of             Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;    03:022:016 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat             their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.    03:022:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:022:018 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children             of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of             Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his             oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings,             which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;    03:022:019 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the             beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.    03:022:020 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it             shall not be acceptable for you.    03:022:021 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the             LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves             or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be             no blemish therein.    03:022:022 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or             scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an             offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.    03:022:023 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or             lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill             offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.    03:022:024 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or             crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering             thereof in your land.    03:022:025 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of             your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them,             and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.    03:022:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:022:027 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then             it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day             and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by             fire unto the LORD.    03:022:028 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her             young both in one day.    03:022:029 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the             LORD, offer it at your own will.    03:022:030 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of             it until the morrow: I am the LORD.    03:022:031 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the             LORD.    03:022:032 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed             among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,    03:022:033 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I             am the LORD.    03:023:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:023:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,             Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to             be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.    03:023:003 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the             sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work             therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.    03:023:004 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations,             which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.    03:023:005 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's             passover.    03:023:006 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of             unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat             unleavened bread.    03:023:007 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall             do no servile work therein.    03:023:008 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD             seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye             shall do no servile work therein.    03:023:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:023:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye             be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap             the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the             firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:    03:023:011 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted             for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave             it.    03:023:012 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb             without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto             the LORD.    03:023:013 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine             flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD             for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of             wine, the fourth part of an hin.    03:023:014 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green             ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering             unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your             generations in all your dwellings.    03:023:015 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,             from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering;             seven sabbaths shall be complete:    03:023:016 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number             fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the             LORD.    03:023:017 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two             tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken             with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.    03:023:018 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish             of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they             shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat             offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by             fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.    03:023:019 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin             offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of             peace offerings.    03:023:020 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the             firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two             lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.    03:023:021 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an             holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work             therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings             throughout your generations.    03:023:022 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make             clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest,             neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou             shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the             LORD your God.    03:023:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:023:024 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh             month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath,             a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.    03:023:025 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an             offering made by fire unto the LORD.    03:023:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:023:027 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a             day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you;             and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by             fire unto the LORD.    03:023:028 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of             atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your             God.    03:023:029 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that             same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.    03:023:030 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same             day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.    03:023:031 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever             throughout your generations in all your dwellings.    03:023:032 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict             your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even             unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.    03:023:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,    03:023:034 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day             of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for             seven days unto the LORD.    03:023:035 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no             servile work therein.    03:023:036 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the             LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you;             and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it             is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.    03:023:037 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to             be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto             the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice,             and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:    03:023:038 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and             beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings,             which ye give unto the LORD.    03:023:039 Also in the fifteenth"]]]
