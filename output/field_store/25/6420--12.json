The dwellings which they erected were arranged in  the form of a quadrangle with an open court in the centre, as at St. Croix,  while gardens and pleasure-grounds were laid out by Champlain in the  immediate vicinity.    When the work of the new settlement was well advanced, De Monts, having  appointed Pont Grave as his lieutenant, departed for France, where he hoped  to obtain additional privileges from the government in his enterprise of  planting a colony in the New World. Champlain preferred to remain, with the  purpose of executing more fully his office as geographer to the king, by  making discoveries on the Atlantic coast still further to the south.    From the beginning, the patentee had cherished the desire of discovering  valuable mines somewhere on his domains, whose wealth, as well as that of  the fur-trade, might defray some part of the heavy expenses involved in his  colonial enterprise. While several investigations for this purpose had  proved abortive, it was hoped that greater success would be attained by  searches along the upper part of the Bay of Fundy. Before the approach of  winter, therefore, Champlain and the miner, Master Jaques, a Sclavonian,  made a tour to St. John, where they obtained the services of the Indian  chief, Secondon, to accompany them and point out the place where copper ore  had been discovered at the Bay of Mines. The search, thorough as was  practicable under the circumstances, was, in the main, unsuccessful; the  few specimens which they found were meagre and insignificant.    The winter at Port Royal was by no means so severe as the preceding one at  St. Croix. The Indians brought in wild game from the forests. The colony  had no want of fuel and pure water. But experience, bitter as it had been,  did not yield to them the fruit of practical wisdom. They referred their  sufferings to the climate, but took too little pains to protect themselves  against its rugged power. Their dwellings, hastily thrown together, were  cold and damp, arising from the green, unseasoned wood of which they were  doubtless in part constructed, and from the standing rainwater with which  their foundations were at all times inundated, which was neither diverted  by embankments nor drawn away by drainage. The dreaded _mal de la terre_,  or scurvy, as might have been anticipated, made its appearance in the early  part of the season, causing the death of twelve out of the forty-five  comprising their whole number, while others were prostrated by this  painful, repulsive, and depressing disease.    The purpose of making further discoveries on the southern coast, warmly  cherished by Champlain, and entering fully into the plans of De Monts, had  not been forgotten. Three times during the early part of the summer they  had equipped their barque, made up their party, and left Port Royal for  this undertaking, and as many times had been driven back by the violence of  the winds and the waves.    In the mean time, the supplies which had been promised and expected from  France had not arrived. This naturally gave to Pont Grave, the lieutenant,  great anxiety, as without them it was clearly inexpedient to venture upon  another winter in the wilds of La Cadie. It had been stipulated by De  Monts, the patentee, that if succors did not arrive before the middle of  July, Pont Grave should make arrangements for the return of the colony by  the fishing vessels to be found at the Grand Banks. Accordingly, on the  17th of that month, Pont Grave set sail with the little colony in two  barques, and proceeded towards Cape Breton, to seek a passage home. But De  Monts had not been remiss in his duty. He had, after many difficulties and  delays, despatched a vessel of a hundred and fifty tons, called the  \"Jonas,\" with fifty men and ample provisions for the approaching winter.  While Pont Grave with his two barques and his retreating colony had run  into Yarmouth Bay for repairs, the \"Jonas\" passed him unobserved, and  anchored in the basin before the deserted settlement of Port Royal. An  advice-boat had, however, been wisely despatched by the \"Jonas\" to  reconnoitre the inlets along the shore, which fortunately intercepted the  departing colony near Cape Sable, and, elated with fresh news from home,  they joyfully returned to the quarters they had so recently abandoned.    In addition to a considerable number of artisans and laborers for the  colony, the \"Jonas\" had brought out Sieur De Poutrincourt, to remain as  lieutenant of La Cadie, and likewise Marc Lescarbot, a young attorney of  Paris, who had already made some scholarly attainments, and who  subsequently distinguished himself as an author, especially by the  publication of a history of New France.    De Poutrincourt immediately addressed himself to putting all things in  order at Port Royal, where it was obviously expedient for the colony to  remain, at least for the winter. As soon as the \"Jonas\" had been unladen,  Pont Grave and most of those who had shared his recent hardships, departed  in her for the shores of France. When the tenements had been cleansed,  refitted, and refurnished, and their provisions had been safely stored, De  Poutrincourt, by way of experiment, to test the character of the climate  and the capability of the soil, despatched a squad of gardeners and farmers  five miles up the river, to the grounds now occupied by the village of  Annapolis, [51] where the soil was open, clear of forest trees, and easy of  cultivation. They planted a great variety of seeds, wheat, rye, hemp, flax,  and of garden esculents, which grew with extraordinary luxuriance, but, as  the season was too late for any of them to ripen, the experiment failed  either as a test of the soil or the climate.    On a former visit in 1604, De Poutrincourt had conceived a great admiration  for Annapolis basin, its protected situation, its fine scenery, and its  rich soil. He had a strong desire to bring his family there and make it his  permanent abode. With this design, he had requested and received from De  Monts a personal grant of this region, which had also been confirmed to him  [52] by Henry IV. But De Monts wished to plant his La Cadian colony in a  milder and more genial climate. He had therefore enjoined upon De  Poutrincourt, as his lieutenant, on leaving France, to continue the  explorations for the selection of a site still farther to the south.  Accordingly, on the 5th of September, 1606, De Poutrincourt left Annapolis  Basin, which the French called Port Royal, in a barque of eighteen tons, to  fulfil this injunction.    It was Champlain's opinion that they ought to sail directly for Nauset  harbor, on Cape Cod, and commence their explorations where their search had  terminated the preceding year, and thus advance into a new region, which  had not already been surveyed. But other counsels prevailed, and a large  part of the time which could be spared for this investigation was exhausted  before they reached the harbor of Nauset. They made a brief visit to the  island of St. Croix, in which De Monts had wintered in 1604-5, touched also  at Saco, where the Indians had already completed their harvest, and the  grapes at Bacchus Island were ripe and luscious. Thence sailing directly to  Cape Anne, where, finding no safe roadstead, they passed round to  Gloucester harbor, which they found spacious, well protected, with good  depth of water, and which, for its great excellence and attractive scenery,  they named _Beauport_, or the beautiful harbor. Here they remained several  days. It was a native settlement, comprising two hundred savages, who were  cultivators of the soil, which was prolific in corn, beans, melons,  pumpkins, tobacco, and grapes. The harbor was environed with fine forest  trees, as hickory, oak, ash, cypress, and sassafras. Within the town there  were several patches of cultivated land, which the Indians were gradually  augmenting by felling the trees, burning the wood, and after a few years,  aided by the natural process of decay, eradicating the stumps. The French  were kindly received and entertained with generous hospitality. Grapes just  gathered from the vines, and squashes of several varieties, the trailing  bean still well known in New England, and the Jerusalem artichoke crisp  from the unexhausted soil, were presented as offerings of welcome to their  guests. While these gifts were doubtless tokens of a genuine friendliness  so far as the savages were capable of that virtue, the lurking spirit of  deceit and treachery which had been inherited and fostered by their habits  and mode of life, could not be restrained.    The French barque was lying at anchor a short distance northeast of Ten  Pound Island. Its boat was undergoing repairs on a peninsula near by, now  known as Rocky Neck, and the sailors were washing their linen just at the  point where the peninsula is united to the mainland. While Champlain was  walking on this causeway, he observed about fifty savages, completely  armed, cautiously screening themselves behind a clump of bushes on the edge  of Smith's Cove. As soon as they were aware that they were seen, they came  forth, concealing their weapons as much as possible, and began to dance in  token of a friendly greeting. But when they discovered De Poutrincourt in  the wood near by, who had approached unobserved, with eight armed  musketeers to disperse them in case of an attack, they immediately took to  flight, and, scattering in all directions, made no further hostile  demonstrations. [53] This serio-comic incident did not interfere with the  interchange of friendly offices between the two parties, and when the  voyagers were about to leave, the savages urged them with great earnestness  to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6659"],[0,"History of King Charles the Second of England (#13)"],[1,"'s could not help her otherwise than by asking  her to come to them. This she at last concluded to do, and she made  her escape from Paris, under the escort of Anne Maria, who came to the  city for the purpose of conducting her, and who succeeded, though with  infinite difficulty, in securing a safe passage for Henrietta through  the crowds of creditors and political foes who threatened to prevent  her journey. These troubles were all, however, at last settled, and  in the autumn (1649) the whole party returned again to Paris.    In the mean time the young King Charles was contriving schemes for  getting possession of his realm. It will be recollected that his sister  Mary, who married the Prince of Orange, was at this time residing at  the Hague, a city in Holland, near the sea. Charles went often there.  It was a sort of rendezvous for those who had been obliged to leave  England on account of their attachment to his father's fortunes, and  who, now that the father was dead, transferred their loyalty to the  son. They felt a very strong desire that Charles's plans for getting  possession of his kingdom should succeed, and they were willing to do  every thing in their power to promote his success. It must not be  supposed, however, that they were governed in this by a disinterested  principle of fidelity to Charles himself personally, or to the justice  of his cause. Their own re-establishment in wealth and power was at  stake as well as his, and they were ready to make common cause with  him, knowing that they could save themselves from ruin only by  reinstating him.    Charles had his privy council and a sort of court at the Hague, and  he arranged channels of communication, centering there, for collecting  intelligence from England and Scotland, and through these he watched  in every way for the opening of an opportunity to assert his rights  to the British crown. He went, too, to Jersey, where the authorities  and the inhabitants were on his side, and both there and at the Hague  he busied himself with plans for raising funds and levying troops, and  securing co-operation from those of the people of England who still  remained loyal. Ireland was generally in his favor too, and he seriously  meditated an expedition there. His mother was unwilling to have him  engage in these schemes. She was afraid he would, sooner or later,  involve himself in dangers from which he could not extricate himself,  and that he would end by being plunged into the same pit of destruction  that had engulfed his father.    Amid all these political schemes, however, Charles did not forget Anne  Maria. He was sager to secure her for his bride; for her fortune, and  the power and influence of her connections, would aid him very much  in recovering his throne. Her hope of marrying the Emperor of Germany,  too, was gone, for that potentate had chosen another wife. Charles  therefore continued his attentions to the young lady. She would not  give him any distinct and decisive answer, but kept the subject in a  state of perpetual negotiation. She was, in fact, growing more and  more discontented and unhappy in disposition all the time. Her favorite  plan of marrying the emperor had been thwarted, in part, by the  difficulties which her friends--her father and her aunt especially--had  contrived secretly to throw in the way, while outwardly and ostensibly  they appeared to be doing all in their power to promote her wishes.  They did not wish to have her married at all, as by this event the  management of her vast fortune would pass out of their hands. She  discovered this, their double dealing, when it was too late, and she  was overwhelmed with vexation and chagrin.    Things being in this state, Charles sent a special messenger, at one  time, from the Hague, with instructions to make a formal proposal to  Anne Maria, and to see if he could not bring the affair to a close.  The name of this messenger was Lord Germain.    The queen regent and her father urged Anne Maria now to consent to the  proposal. They told her that Charles's prospects were brightening--that  they themselves were going to render him powerful protection--that he  had already acquired several allies--that there were whole provinces  in England that were in his favor; and that all Ireland, which was,  as it were, a kingdom in itself, was on his side. Whether they seriously  desired that Anne Maria would consent to Charles's proposals, or only  urged, for effect, what they knew very well she would persist in  refusing, it is impossible to ascertain. If this latter were their  design, it seemed likely to fail, for Anne Maria appeared to yield.  She was sorry, she said, that the situation of affairs in Paris was  not such as to allow of the French government giving Charles effectual  help in gaining possession of the throne; but still, not withstanding  that, she was ready to do what ever they might think best to command.    Lord Germain then said that he should proceed directly to Holland and  escort Charles to France, and he wanted Anne Maria to give him a direct  and positive reply; for if she would really accept his proposal, he  would come at once to court and claim her as his bride; otherwise he  must proceed to Ireland, for the state of his affairs demanded his  presence there. But if she would accept his proposal, he would  immediately come to Paris, and have the marriage ceremony performed,  and then he would remain afterward some days with her, that she might  enjoy the honors and distinctions to which she would become entitled  as the queen consort of a mighty realm. He would then, if she liked  the plan, take her to Saint Germain's, where his mother, her aunt, was  then residing, and establish her there while he was recovering his  kingdom; or, if she preferred it, she might take up her residence in  Paris, where she had been accustomed to live.    To this the young lady replied that the last mentioned plan, that is,  that she should continue to live at Paris after being married to  Charles, was one that she could not think of. She should feel altogether  unwilling to remain and enjoy the gayeties and festivities of Paris  while her husband was at the head of his armies, exposed to all the  dangers and privations of a camp; nor should she consider it right to  go on incurring the expenses which a lady of her rank and position  must necessarily bear in such a city, while he was perhaps embarrassed  and distressed with the difficulties of providing funds for his own  and his followers' necessities. She should feel, in fact, bound, if  she were to become his wife, to do all in her power to assist him; and  it would end, she foresaw, in her having to dispose of all her property,  and expend the avails in aiding him to recover his kingdom. This, she  said, she confessed alarmed her. It was a great sacrifice for her to  make, reared as she had been in opulence and luxury. Lord Germain  replied that all this was doubtless true, but then, on the other hand,  he would venture to remind her that there was no other suitable match  for her in Europe. He then went on to name the principal personages.  The Emperor of Germany and the King of Spain were both married. Some  other monarch was just about to espouse a Spanish princess. Others  whom he named were too young; others, again, too old; and a certain  prince whom he mentioned had been married, he said, these ten years,  and his wife was in excellent health, so that every species of hope  seemed to be cut off in that quarter.    This conversation leading to no decisive result, Lord Germain renewed  the subject after a few days, and pressed Anne Maria for a final answer.  She said, now, that she had a very high regard for Queen Henrietta,  and, indeed, a very strong affection for her; so strong that she should  be willing to waive, for Henrietta's sake, all her objections to the  disadvantages of Charles's position; but there was one objection which  she felt that she could not surmount, and that was his religion. He  was a Protestant, while she was a Catholic. Charles must remove this  difficulty himself, which, if he had any regard for her, he certainly  would be willing to do, since she would have to make so many sacrifices  for him. Lord Germain, however, immediately discouraged this idea. He  said that the position of Charles in respect to his kingdom was such  as to render it impossible for him to change his religious faith. In  fact, if he were to do so, he would be compelled to give up, at once,  all hope of ever getting possession of his throne. Anne Maria knew  this very well. The plea, however, made an excellent excuse to defend  herself with from Lord Germain's importunities. She adhered to it,  therefore, pertinaciously; the negotiation was broken off, and Lord  Germain went away.    Young adventurers like Charles, who wish to marry great heiresses,  have always to exercise a great deal of patience, and to submit to a  great many postponements and delays, even though they are successful  in the end; and sovereign princes are not excepted, any more than other  men, from this necessity. Dependent as woman is during all the earlier  and all the later years of her life, and subjected as she is to the  control, and too often, alas! to the caprice and injustice of man,  there is a period--brief, it is true--when she is herself in power;  and such characters as Anne Maria like to exercise their authority,  while they feel that they possess it, with a pretty high hand. Charles  seems to have felt the necessity of submitting to the inconvenience  of Anne Maria's capricious delays, and, as long as she only continued  to make excuses and objections instead of giving him a direct and  positive refusal, he was led to persevere. Accordingly, not long after  the conversations which his messenger had held with the lady as already  described, he determined to come himself to France, and see if he could  not accomplish"]]]
