Of course there was no  such thing as organization in the pioneer days. Men were voted for to  a great extent independently of partisan questions affecting the  nation at large, and in this way the higher offices of the State were  filled for many years by men whose personal character compelled the  respect and esteem of the citizens. The year 1826 is generally taken  as the date which witnessed the change from personal to partisan  politics, though several years more elapsed before the rule of  conventions came in, which put an end to individual candidacy. In that  year, Daniel Pope Cook, who had long represented the State in Congress  with singular ability and purity, was defeated by Governor Joseph  Duncan, the candidate of the Jackson men, on account of the vote given  by Cook which elected John Quincy Adams to the Presidency. The bitter  intolerance of the Jackson party naturally caused their opponents to  organize against them, and there were two parties in the State from  that time forward. The change in political methods was inevitable, and  it is idle to deplore it; but the former system gave the better men in  the new State a power and prominence which they have never since  enjoyed. Such men as Governor Ninian Edwards, who came with the  prestige of a distinguished family connection, a large fortune, a good  education, and a distinction of manners and of dress--ruffles, gold  buttons, and fair-topped boots--which would hardly have been pardoned  a few years later; and Governor Edward Coles, who had been private  secretary to Madison, and was familiar with the courts of Europe, a  man as notable for his gentleness of manners as for his nobility of  nature, could never have come so readily and easily to the head of the  government after the machine of the caucus had been perfected. Real  ability then imposed itself with more authority upon the ignorant and  unpretending politicians from the back timber; so that it is remarked  by those who study the early statutes of Illinois that they are far  better drawn up, and better edited, than those of a later period, when  illiterate tricksters, conscious of the party strength behind them,  insisted on shaping legislation according to their own fancy. The men  of cultivation wielded an influence in the Legislature entirely out of  proportion to their numbers, as the ruder sort of pioneers were  naturally in a large majority. The type of a not uncommon class in  Illinois tradition was a member from the South who could neither read  nor write, and whose apparently ironical patronymic was Grammar. When  first elected he had never worn anything except leather; but regarding  his tattered buckskin as unfit for the garb of a lawgiver, he and his  sons gathered hazelnuts enough to barter at the nearest store for a  few yards of blue strouding such as the Indians used for breech-  clouts. When he came home with his purchase and had called together  the women of the settlement to make his clothes, it was found that  there was only material enough for a very short coat and a long pair  of leggins, and thus attired he went to Kaskaskia, the territorial  capital. Uncouth as was his appearance, he had in him the raw material  of a politician. He invented a system--which was afterwards adopted by  many whose breeches were more fashionably cut--of voting against every  measure which was proposed. If it failed, the responsibility was  broadly shared; if it passed and was popular, no one would care who  voted against it; if it passed and did not meet the favor of the  people, John Grammar could vaunt his foresight. Between the men like  Coles and the men like Grammar there was a wide interval, and the  average was about what the people of the State deserved and could  appreciate. A legislator was as likely to suffer for doing right as  for doing wrong. Governor Ford, in his admirable sketch of the early  history of the State, mentions two acts of the Legislature, both of  them proper and beneficial, as unequaled in their destructive  influence upon the great folks of the State. One was a bill for a loan  to meet the honest obligations of the commonwealth, commonly called  \"the Wiggins loan\"; and the other was a law to prevent bulls of  inferior size and breed from running at large. This latter set loose  all the winds of popular fury: it was cruel, it was aristocratic; it  was in the interest of rich men and pampered foreign bulls; and it  ended the career of many an aspiring politician in a blast of  democratic indignation and scorn. The politician who relied upon  immediate and constant contact with the people certainly earned all  the emoluments of office he received. His successes were hardly  purchased by laborious affability. \"A friend of mine,\" says Ford,  \"once informed me that he intended to be a candidate for the  Legislature, but would not declare himself until just before the  election, and assigned as a reason that it was so very hard to be  clever for a long time at once.\" Before the caucus had eliminated the  individual initiative, there was much more of personal feeling in  elections. A vote against a man had something of offense in it, and  sometimes stirred up a defeated candidate to heroic vengeance. In 1827  the Legislature elected a State treasurer after an exciting contest,  and before the members had left the house the unsuccessful aspirant  came in and soundly thrashed, one after the other, four of the  representatives who had voted against him. Such energy was sure to  meet its reward, and he was soon after made clerk of the Circuit  Court. It is related by old citizens of Menard County, as a  circumstance greatly to the credit of Abraham Lincoln, that when he  was a candidate for the Legislature a man who wanted his vote for  another place walked to the polls with him and ostentatiously voted  for him, hoping to receive his vote in return. Lincoln voted against  him, and the act was much admired by those who saw it.    One noticeable fact is observed in relation to the politicians of the  day--their careers were generally brief. Superannuation came early. In  the latter part of the last century and the first half of this, men  were called old whom we should regard as in the prime of life. When  the friends of Washington were first pressing the Presidency upon him  in 1788, he urged his \"advanced age\" as an imperative reason for  declining it: he was fifty-six years old. When Ninian Edwards was a  candidate for Governor of Illinois in 1826, he was only fifty-one, and  yet he considered it necessary in his published addresses to refer to  the charge that he was too old for the place, and, while admitting the  fact that he was no longer young, to urge in extenuation that there  are some old things,--like old whisky, old bacon, and old friends,--  which are not without their merits. Even so late as 1848, we find a  remarkable letter from Mr. Lincoln, who was then in Congress, bearing  upon the same point. His partner, William H. Herndon, had written him  a letter, complaining that the old men in Sangamon County were  unwilling to let the young ones have any opportunity to distinguish  themselves. To this Lincoln answered in his usual tone of grave  kindness: \"The subject of your letter is exceedingly painful to me;  and I cannot but think there is some mistake in your impression of the  motives of the old men. I suppose I am now one of the old men, and I  declare on my veracity, which I think is good with you, that nothing  could afford me more satisfaction than to learn that you and others of  my young friends at home were doing battle in the contest and  endearing themselves to the people and taking a stand far above any I  have ever been able to reach in their admiration. I cannot conceive  that other old men feel differently. Of course, I cannot demonstrate  what I say; but I was young once, and I am sure I was never  ungenerously thrust back.\" The man who thus counseled petulant youth  with the experienced calmness of age was thirty-nine years old. A  state of society where one could at that age call himself or be called  by others an old man, is proved by that fact alone to be one of  wearing hardships and early decay of the vital powers. The survivors  of the pioneers stoutly insist upon the contrary view. \"It was a  glorious life,\" says one old patriarch; \"men would fight for the love  of it, and then shake hands and be friends; there is nothing like it  now.\" Another says, \"I never enjoy my breakfast now as I used to, when  I got up and ran down a deer before I could have anything to eat.\" But  they see the past through a rosy mist of memory, transfigured by the  eternal magic of youth. The sober fact is that the life was a hard  one, with few rational pleasures, few wholesome appliances. The strong  ones lived, and some even attained great length of years; but to the  many age came early and was full of infirmity and pain. If we could go  back to what our fore-fathers endured in clearing the Western  wilderness, we could then better appreciate our obligations to them.  It is detracting from the honor which is their due to say that their  lives had much of happiness or comfort, or were in any respect  preferable to our own.          CHAPTER IV    NEW SALEM      During the latter part of \"the winter of the deep snow,\" Lincoln  became acquainted with one Denton Offutt, an adventurous and  discursive sort of merchant, with more irons in the fire than he could  well manage. He wanted to take a flat-boat and cargo to New Orleans,  and having heard that Hanks and Lincoln had some experience of the  river, he insisted on their joining him. John Johnston was afterwards  added to the party, probably at the request of his foster-brother, to  share in the golden profits of the enterprise; for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6818"],[0,"The Arctic Prairies : a Canoe-Journey of 2,000 Miles in Search of the Caribou; (#13)"],[1,"\" 1904            \"          36,116   \" 1905            \"          58,850   \" 1906            \"          61,388   \" 1907            \"          36,201   \" 1908            \"           9,664      Remembering, then, that the last of the Rabbits were wiped out in  the winter of 1906-7, it will be understood that there were thousands  of starving Lynxes roaming about the country. The number that we  saw, and their conditions, all helped to emphasise the dire story  of plague and famine.    Some of my notes are as follows:    May 18th, Athabaska River, on roof of a trapper's hut found the  bodies of 30 Lynxes.    May 19th, young Lynx shot to-day, female, very thin, weighed only  12 1/2 lbs., should have weighed 25. In its stomach nothing but  the tail of a white-footed mouse. Liver somewhat diseased. In its  bowels at least one tapeworm.    June 3d, a young male Lynx shot to-day by one of the police boys,  as previously recorded. Starving; it weighed only 15 lbs.    June 6th, adult female Lynx killed, weighed 15 lbs.; stomach contained  a Redsquirrel, a Chipmunk, and a Bog-lemming. (Synaptomys borealis.)    June 18th, young male Lynx, weight 13 lbs., shot by Preble on Smith  Landing; had in its stomach a Chipmunk (borealis) and 4 small young  of the same, apparently a week old; also a score of pinworms. How  did it get the Chipmunk family without digging them out?    June 26th, on Salt Mt. found the dried-up body of a Lynx firmly  held in a Bear trap.    June 29th, one of the Jarvis bear-cub skins was destroyed by the  dogs, except a dried-up paw, which he threw out yesterday. This  morning one of the men shot a starving Lynx in camp. Its stomach  contained nothing but the bear paw thrown out last night.    These are a few of my observations; they reflect the general  condition--all were starving. Not one of them had any Rabbit in its  stomach; not one had a bellyful; none of the females were bearing  young this year.    To embellish these severe and skeletal notes, I add some incidents  supplied by various hunters of the north.    Let us remember that the Lynx is a huge cat weighing 25 to 35 or  even 40 lbs., that it is an ordinary cat multiplied by some 4 or  5 diameters, and we shall have a good foundation for comprehension.    Murdo McKay has often seen 2 or 3 Lynxes together in March, the  mating season. They fight, and caterwaul like a lot of tomcats.    The uncatlike readiness of the Lynx to take to water is well known;  that it is not wholly at home there is shown by the fact that if  one awaits a Lynx at the landing he is making for, he will not turn  aside in the least, but come right on to land, fight, and usually  perish.    The ancient feud between cat and dog is not forgotten in the north,  for the Lynx is the deadly foe of the Fox and habitually kills it  when there is soft snow and scarcity of easier prey. Its broad feet  are snowshoes enabling it to trot over the surface on Reynard's  trail. The latter easily runs away at first, but sinking deeply  at each bound, his great speed is done in 15 or 6 miles; the Lynx  keeps on the same steady trot and finally claims its victim.    John Bellecourt related that in the January of 1907, at a place 40  miles south of Smith Landing, he saw in the snow where a Lynx bad  run down and devoured a Fox.    A contribution by T. Anderson runs thus:    In late March, 1907, an Indian named Amil killed a Caribou near  Fort Rae. During his absence a Lynx came along and gorged itself  with the meat, then lay down alongside to sleep. A Silver Fox came  next; but the Lynx sprang on him and killed him. When Amil came  back he found the Fox and got a large sum for the skin; one shoulder  was torn. He did not see the Lynx but saw the tracks.    The same old-timer is authority for a case in which the tables were  turned.    A Desert Indian on the headwaters of the Gatineau went out in the  early spring looking for Beaver. At a well-known pond he saw a  Lynx crouching on a log, watching the Beaver hole in the ice. The  Indian waited. At length a Beaver came up cautiously and crawled  out to a near bunch of willows; the Lynx sprang, but the Beaver  was well under way and dived into the hole with the Lynx hanging  to him. After a time the Indian took a crotched pole and fished  about under the ice; at last he found something soft and got it  out; it was the Lynx drowned.    Belalise ascribes another notable achievement to this animal.    One winter when hunting Caribou near Fond du Lac with an Indian  named Tenahoo (human tooth), they saw a Lynx sneaking along after  some Caribou; they saw it coming but had not sense enough to run  away. It sprang on the neck of a young buck; the buck bounded away  with the Lynx riding, but soon fell dead. The hunters came up;  the Lynx ran off. There was little blood and no large wound on the  buck; probably its neck was broken. The Indian said the Lynx always  kills with its paw, and commonly kills Deer. David MacPherson  corroborates this and maintains that on occasion it will even kill  Moose.    In southern settlements, where the Lynx is little known, it is  painted as a fearsome beast of limitless ferocity, strength, and  activity. In the north, where it abounds and furnishes staple furs  and meat, it is held in no such awe. It is never known to attack  man. It often follows his trail out of curiosity, and often the  trapper who is so followed gets the Lynx by waiting in ambush; then  it is easily killed with a charge of duck-shot. When caught in a  snare a very small club is used to \"add it to the list.\" It seems  tremendously active among logs and brush piles, but on the level  ground its speed is poor, and a good runner can overtake one in a  few hundred yards.    David MacPherson says that last summer he ran down a Lynx on a  prairie of Willow River (Mackenzie), near Providence. It had some  90 yards start; he ran it down in about a mile, then it turned to  fight and he shot it.    Other instances have been recorded, and finally, as noted later,  I was eye-witness of one of these exploits. Since the creature can  be run down on hard ground, it is not surprising to learn that men  on snow-shoes commonly pursue it successfully. As long as it trots  it is safe, but when it gets alarmed and bounds it sinks and becomes  exhausted. It runs in a circle of about a mile, and at last takes  to a tree where it is easily killed. At least one-third are taken  in this way; it requires half an hour to an hour, there must be  soft snow, and the Lynx must be scared so he leaps; then he sinks;  if not scared he glides along on his hairy snow-shoes, refuses  to tree, and escapes in thick woods, where the men cannot follow  quickly.          CHAPTER XV    EBB AND FLOW OF ANIMAL LIFE        Throughout this voyage we were struck by the rarity of some sorts  of animals and the continual remarks that three, five, or six years  ago these same sorts were extremely abundant; and in some few cases  the conditions were reversed.    For example, during a week spent at Fort Smith, Preble had out a  line of 50 mouse-traps every night and caught only one  Shrew and  one Meadowmouse in the week. Four years before he had trapped on  exactly the same ground, catching 30 or 40 Meadowmice every night.    Again, in 1904 it was possible to see 100 Muskrats any fine evening.  In 1907, though continually on the lookout, I saw less than a score  in six months. Redsquirrels varied in the same way.    Of course, the Rabbits themselves were the extreme case, millions  in 1904, none at all in 1907. The present, then, was a year of low  ebb. The first task was to determine whether this related to all  mammalian life. Apparently not, because Deermice, Lynxes, Beaver,  and Caribou were abundant. Yet these are not their maximum years;  the accounts show them to have been so much more numerous last  year.    There is only one continuous statistical record of the abundance  of animals, that is the returns of the fur trade. These have been  kept for over 200 years, and if we begin after the whole continent  was covered by fur-traders, they are an accurate gauge of the  abundance of each species. Obviously, this must be so, for the whole  country is trapped over every year, all the furs are marketed, most  of them through the Hudson's Bay Company, and whatever falls into  other hands is about the same percentage each year, therefore the  H. B. Co. returns are an accurate gauge of the relative rise and  fall of the population.    Through the courtesy of its officials I have secured the Company's  returns for the 85 years--1821-1905 inclusive. I take 1821 as the  starting-point, as that was the first year when the whole region  was covered by the Hudson's Bay Company to the exclusion of all  important rivals.    First, I have given these accounts graphic tabulation, and at once  many interesting facts are presented to the eye. The Rabbit line  prior to 1845 is not reliable. Its subsequent close coincidence  with that of Lynx, Marten, Skunk, and Fox is evidently cause and  effect.    The Mink coincides fairly well with Skunk and Marten.    The Muskrat's variation probably has relation chiefly to the amount  of water, which, as is well known, is cyclic in the north-West.    The general resemblance of Beaver and Otter lines may not mean  anything. If, as said, the Otter occasionally preys on the Beaver,  these lines should in some degree correspond.    The Wolf line does not manifest any special relationship and seems  to be in a class by itself. The great destruction from 1840 to 1870  was probably due to strychnine, newly introduced about then.    The Bear, Badger, and Wolverine go along with little variation.  Probably the Coon does the same; the enormous rise in 1867 from  an average of 3,500 per annum. to 24,000 was most likely a result  of accidental accumulation and not representative of any special  abundance. Finally, each and every line manifests extraordinary  variability in the "]]]
