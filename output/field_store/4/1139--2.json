THEO. PRESSER CO., Pub's., Phila., Pa.                                    HOW TO USE THIS BOOK      This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF GREAT  MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of \"Pictures from the Lives  of the Great Composers for Children,\" \"Music Talks with Children,\"  \"First Studies in Music Biography,\" and others.    The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the  child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place  throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as  will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to  cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the  corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around  each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.    After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the  book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the  great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous  pages.    The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the  cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's  own book.    This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting  task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to  the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth  while.                       *       *       *       *       *    This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians includes at  present a book on each of the following:                Bach                            MacDowell              Beethoven                       Mendelssohn              Brahms                          Mozart              Chopin                          Schubert              Grieg                           Schumann              Handel                          Tschaikowsky              Haydn                           Verdi              Liszt                           Wagner                            Printed in U.

The Story of a Boy Who Became a Great                            Pianist and Teacher      This is the house in which was born a little boy who became a famous  pianist and a great teacher. This house is in Raiding, in Hungary.                             [Illustration: No. 2                    HOUSE IN WHICH FRANZ LISZT WAS BORN]    Now-a-days there is a little tablet over the door, which tells us that  Franz Liszt was born in this house, on the Twenty-second Day of October,  1811.                              [Illustration: No. 3                               JOSEPH HAYDN]    Do you remember that once upon a time Joseph Haydn lived as court  musician in the Esterhazy family? He wore a tie wig and a wonderful  bright uniform; for he was master of the music in that great house.    Now, long after Joseph Haydn's time, Adam Liszt, father of Franz, lived  with the Esterhazy's. He was the family steward, having charge of all  the property.    And, too, he loved music. So we may believe that he told his little boy,  Franz, about the great master Haydn. For Adam Liszt was not only a lover  of music but he gave his son his first lessons in piano playing. Liszt's  mother was of German blood. She was born in lower Austria.                         [Illustration: No. 4 and No. 5                         LISZT'S MOTHER AND FATHER]    Little Franz practiced so faithfully and so eagerly, I am sure, that  when he was only nine years of age he gave a concert in public. He  played so well that some good friends offered to send him to Vienna  where he could continue his studies.    And so the little boy left home and began the studies that led him to  become the greatest pianist of his time. His piano teacher was a man of  whom almost everybody knows. Does he not have a round, good-natured  face? And does he not look kind? Well, he could be severe when his  pupil's lessons did not please him.    His name was Carl Czerny. Here is his picture.                             [Illustration: No. 6                                CARL CZERNY]    On New Year's day of the year that little Franz was eleven years old he  played in public in Vienna. It must have been a wonderful occasion. All  the great people were there; and among them was one who was greatest of  all, Beethoven.                             [Illustration: No. 7                                 BEETHOVEN]    Then Adam Liszt thought his boy should go to Paris. He wished him to  become a student in the conservatory there. But its director, Cherubini,  refused to admit Franz to the classes. So, like most of us, he studied  with a private teacher. Also, he traveled to England and to all the  countries of Europe, giving concerts. His fame was becoming greater and  his playing was the delight of all who heard him. Here are two pictures  of Franz as a boy. He dressed differently from boys of to-day. But do  you not think his face is a fine one? Full of light and life and  eagerness?                         [Illustration: No. 8 and No. 9                              LISZT AS A BOY]    Franz was only sixteen years old when his father died. They had been  good comrades, had traveled together and talked with one another about  music and musicians. The boy must have grieved keenly over the loss of  so good and kind a companion as his father had been. But he went  earnestly to work to earn a living for his mother and himself. He knew  many famous people and we may be sure that everyone helped him. Here are  two of Franz's friends of that time.                             [Illustration: No. 10                                VICTOR HUGO]                             [Illustration: No. 11                                 F. CHOPIN]                             [Illustration: No. 12                               AT THE PIANO]    I am sure you will like to know how Liszt looked as he sat at the piano.  Here he sits playing. You see he had only a simple kind of piano. But he  mastered it so thoroughly that he could make people wonder at his art.  That is what we learn from the lives of famous people. They are always  true to their talent.    After Liszt had traveled many years over Europe (he never visited the  United States), he became conductor at the Court Theatre at Weimar. This  new music work interested him so much that he gave up travel as a  concert pianist. He helped many composers by having their operas  performed at the Weimar Theatre. Some of the operas that had their first  performance there are now famous indeed.    Among these were \"Lohengrin,\" \"Tannhauser\" and \"The Flying Dutchman\" by  Richard Wagner.                             [Illustration: No. 13                                 R. WAGNER]                             [Illustration: No. 14                                R. SCHUMANN]                             [Illustration: No. 15                                F. SCHUBERT]    Then there were \"Genoveva\" and \"Manfred\" by Robert Schumann. Also  \"Alfonzo and Estrella\" by Franz Schubert was given. It would have  delighted Schubert's heart if he could have heard this; but he, poor  man, had died some years before.    Then Liszt did something else at Weimar that endeared him to hosts of  pianists. He held classes and taught the secrets of his wonderful  playing to those who were talented and could understand. He was the soul  of generosity. When someone, who was gifted but could not pay, came for  advice, he gave it freely. When concerts did not pay, he himself often  took the loss so that others should not suffer.

In introducing the present edition of M. de Bourrienne's Memoirs to  the public we are bound, as Editors, to say a few Words on the subject.  Agreeing, however, with Horace Walpole that an editor should not dwell  for any length of time on the merits of his author, we shall touch but  lightly on this part of the matter. We are the more ready to abstain  since the great success in England of the former editions of these  Memoirs, and the high reputation they have acquired on the European  Continent, and in every part of the civilised world where the fame of  Bonaparte has ever reached, sufficiently establish the merits of M. de  Bourrienne as a biographer. These merits seem to us to consist chiefly  in an anxious desire to be impartial, to point out the defects as well  as the merits of a most wonderful man; and in a peculiarly graphic power  of relating facts and anecdotes. With this happy faculty Bourrienne  would have made the life of almost any active individual interesting;  but the subject of which the most favourable circumstances permitted  him to treat was full of events and of the most extraordinary facts. The  hero of his story was such a being as the world has produced only on the  rarest occasions, and the complete counterpart to whom has, probably,  never existed; for there are broad shades of difference between Napoleon  and Alexander, Caesar, and Charlemagne; neither will modern history  furnish more exact parallels, since Gustavus Adolphus, Frederick the  Great, Cromwell, Washington, or Bolivar bear but a small resemblance  to Bonaparte either in character, fortune, or extent of enterprise. For  fourteen years, to say nothing of his projects in the East, the history  of Bonaparte was the history of all Europe!    With the copious materials he possessed, M. de Bourrienne has produced  a work which, for deep interest, excitement, and amusement, can scarcely  be paralleled by any of the numerous and excellent memoirs for which the  literature of France is so justly celebrated.    M. de Bourrienne shows us the hero of Marengo and Austerlitz in his  night-gown and slippers--with a 'trait de plume' he, in a hundred  instances, places the real man before us, with all his personal habits  and peculiarities of manner, temper, and conversation.    The friendship between Bonaparte and Bourrienne began in boyhood, at the  school of Brienne, and their unreserved intimacy continued during the  most brilliant part of Napoleon's career. We have said enough, the  motives for his writing this work and his competency for the task will  be best explained in M. de Bourrienne's own words, which the reader will  find in the Introductory Chapter.    M. de Bourrienne says little of Napoleon after his first abdication and  retirement to Elba in 1814: we have endeavoured to fill up the chasm  thus left by following his hero through the remaining seven years of  his life, to the \"last scenes of all\" that ended his \"strange, eventful  history,\"--to his deathbed and alien grave at St. Helena. A completeness  will thus be given to the work which it did not before possess, and  which we hope will, with the other additions and improvements already  alluded to, tend to give it a place in every well-selected library, as  one of the most satisfactory of all the lives of Napoleon.    LONDON, 1836.        PREFACE 1885 EDITION.    The Memoirs of the time of Napoleon may be divided into two  classes--those by marshals and officers, of which Suchet's is a good  example, chiefly devoted to military movements, and those by persons  employed in the administration and in the Court, giving us not only  materials for history, but also valuable details of the personal and  inner life of the great Emperor and of his immediate surroundings.  Of this latter class the Memoirs of Bourrienne are among the most  important.    Long the intimate and personal friend of Napoleon both at school and  from the end of the Italian campaigns in 1797 till 1802--working in the  same room with him, using the same purse, the confidant of most of  his schemes, and, as his secretary, having the largest part of all  the official and private correspondence of the time passed through  his hands, Bourrienne occupied an invaluable position for storing and  recording materials for history. The Memoirs of his successor, Meneval,  are more those of an esteemed private secretary; yet, valuable and  interesting as they are, they want the peculiarity of position which  marks those of Bourrienne, who was a compound of secretary, minister,  and friend. The accounts of such men as Miot de Melito, Raederer, etc.,  are most valuable, but these writers were not in that close contact with  Napoleon enjoyed by Bourrienne. Bourrienne's position was simply unique,  and we can only regret that he did not occupy it till the end of the  Empire. Thus it is natural that his Memoirs should have been largely  used by historians, and to properly understand the history of the time,  they must be read by all students. They are indeed full of interest for  every one. But they also require to be read with great caution. When  we meet with praise of Napoleon, we may generally believe it, for, as  Thiers (Consulat., ii. 279) says, Bourrienne need be little suspected  on this side, for although he owed everything to Napoleon, he has not  seemed to remember it. But very often in passages in which blame is  thrown on Napoleon, Bourrienne speaks, partly with much of the natural  bitterness of a former and discarded friend, and partly with the curious  mixed feeling which even the brothers of Napoleon display in their  Memoirs, pride in the wonderful abilities evinced by the man with whom  he was allied, and jealousy at the way in which he was outshone by the  man he had in youth regarded as inferior to himself. Sometimes also we  may even suspect the praise. Thus when Bourrienne defends Napoleon  for giving, as he alleges, poison to the sick at Jaffa, a doubt arises  whether his object was to really defend what to most Englishmen of  this day, with remembrances of the deeds and resolutions of the Indian  Mutiny, will seem an act to be pardoned, if not approved; or whether he  was more anxious to fix the committal of the act on Napoleon at a  time when public opinion loudly blamed it. The same may be said of his  defence of the massacre of the prisoners of Jaffa.    Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne was born in 1769, that is, in the  same year as Napoleon Bonaparte, and he was the friend and companion  of the future Emperor at the military school of Brienne-le-Chateau till  1784, when Napoleon, one of the sixty pupils maintained at the expense  of the State, was passed on to the Military School of Paris. The friends  again met in 1792 and in 1795, when Napoleon was hanging about Paris,  and when Bourrienne looked on the vague dreams of his old schoolmate  as only so much folly. In 1796, as soon as Napoleon had assured his  position at the head of the army of Italy, anxious as ever to surround  himself with known faces, he sent for Bourrienne to be his secretary.  Bourrienne had been appointed in 1792 as secretary of the Legation at  Stuttgart, and had, probably wisely, disobeyed the orders given him to  return, thus escaping the dangers of the Revolution. He only came back  to Paris in 1795, having thus become an emigre. He joined Napoleon in  1797, after the Austrians had been beaten out of Italy, and at once  assumed the office of secretary which he held for so long. He had  sufficient tact to forbear treating the haughty young General with any  assumption of familiarity in public, and he was"]]]
