[Photographic reproduction of the original title page.]          Foreword      In presenting this reprint to our members the editor wishes to express  his thanks to Professor W. T. Brigham of the Bishop Museum for  furnishing him with a photograph of Captain Cook, from which the cut in  this reprint was made; to Mr. John F. G. Stokes of the Bishop Museum for  his assistance in identifying the Hawaiian names, and to Mr. J. W.  Waldron for furnishing a typewritten copy of the book of which this is a  reprint.    The modern Hawaiian names are inserted in brackets following those given  in the text.    This reprint was edited and indexed for the Hawaiian Historical Society  by Bruce Cartwright, Jr.          Preface      To those who have perused the account of the last voyage to the Pacific  Ocean, the following sheets may, at first sight, appear superfluous. The  author, however, being of the opinion, that the event of Captain Cook's  death has not yet been so explicitly related as the importance of it  required, trusts that this Narrative will not be found altogether a  repetition of what is already known. At the same time, he wishes to add  his humble testimony to the merit of the account given of this  transaction by Captain King. Its brevity alone can afford an excuse for  this publication, the object of which is to give a more particular  relation of that unfortunate affair, which he finds is in general but  imperfectly understood. He thinks himself warranted in saying this, from  having frequently observed, that the public opinion seemed to attribute  the loss of Captain Cook's life, in some measure, to rashness or too  much confidence on his side; whereas nothing can be more ill-founded or  unjust. It is, therefore, a duty which his friends owe to his character,  to have the whole affair candidly and fully related, whatever facts it  may involve, that may appear of a disagreeable nature to individuals.  The author is confident, that if Captain King could have foreseen, that  any wrong opinion respecting Captain Cook, would have been the  consequence of omitting some circumstances relative to his death; the  goodnatured motive that induced him to be silent, would not have stood a  moment in competition with the superior call of justice to the memory of  his friend. This publication, he is satisfied, would not have been  disapproved of by Captain King, for whose memory he has the highest  esteem, and to whose friendship he is under many obligations. He is  sanguine enough to believe that it will serve to remove a supposition,  in this single instance, injurious to the memory of Captain Cook, who  was no less distinguished for his caution and prudence, than for his  eminent abilities and undaunted resolution.    The late appearance of this Narrative has been owing to the peculiar  situation of the writer, whose domestic residence is at a great distance  from the metropolis, and whose duty frequently calls him from home for  several months together. He has the pleasure of adding, that, in  publishing the following account of Captain Cook's death, he acts in  concurrence with the opinion of some very respectable persons.          Narrative of the Death of Captain Cook      In the month of January, 1779, the \"Resolution\" and \"Discovery\" lay  about a fortnight at anchor in the bay of Kerag,e,goo,ah[1]  (Kealakekua), in the Island of Ou-why-ee (Hawaii). During that time, the  ships were most plentifully supplied with provisions by natives, with  whom we lived on the most friendly terms. We were universally treated by  them with kind attention and hospitality; but the respect they paid to  Captain Cook, was little short of adoration. It was, therefore, with  sentiments of the most perfect good-will towards the inhabitants, that  we left the harbour, on the fourth of February. It was Captain Cook's  intention to visit the other islands to leeward, and we stood to the  westward, towards Mowee (Maui), attended by several canoes full of  people, who were willing to accompany us as far as they could, before  they bade us a final adieu.    On the sixth, we were overtaken by a gale of wind; and the next night,  the \"Resolution\" had the misfortune of springing the head of her  foremast, in such a dangerous manner, that Captain Cook was obliged to  return to Keragegooah (Kealakekua), in order to have it repaired; for we  could find no other convenient harbour on the island. The same gale had  occasioned much distress among some canoes, that had paid a visit from  the shore. One of them, with two men and a child on board, was picked up  by the \"Resolution,\" and rescued from destruction: the men, having  toiled hard all night, in attempting to reach the land, were so much  exhausted, that they could hardly mount the ship's side. When they got  upon the quarter-deck, they burst into tears, and seemed much affected  with the dangerous situation from which they had escaped; but the little  child appeared lively and cheerful. One of the \"Resolution's\" boats was  also so fortunate as to save a man and two women, whose canoe had been  upset by the violence of the waves. They were brought on board, and,  with the others, partook of the kindness and humanity of Captain Cook.    On the morning of Wednesday, the tenth, we were within a few miles of  the harbour; and were soon joined by several canoes, in which appeared  many of our old acquaintances; who seemed to have come to welcome us  back. Among them was Coo,aha[2] (Kuaha), a priest: he had brought a  small pig, and some cocoa nuts in his hand, which, after having chaunted  a few sentences, he presented to Captain Clerke. He then left us, and  hastened on board the \"Resolution,\" to perform the same friendly  ceremony before Captain Cook. Having but light winds all that day, we  could not gain the harbour. In the afternoon, a chief of the first rank,  and nearly related to Kariopoo (Kalaniopuu), paid us a visit on board  the \"Discovery.\" His name was Ka,mea,mea (Kamehameha): he was dressed in  a very rich feathered cloke, which he seemed to have brought for sale,  but would part with it for nothing except iron daggers. These, the  chiefs, some time before our departure, had preferred to every other  article; for having received a plentiful supply of hatchets and other  tools, they began to collect a store of warlike instruments. Kameamea  (Kamehameha) procured nine daggers for his cloke, and being pleased with  his reception, he and his attendants slept on board that night.    In the morning of the eleventh of February, the ships anchored again in  Keragegooah bay (Kealakekua Bay), and preparation was immediately made  for landing the \"Resolution's\" foremast. We were visited but by few of  the Indians, because there were but few in the bay. On our departure,  those belonging to other parts, had repaired to their several  habitations, and were again to collect from various quarters, before we  could expect to be surrounded by such multitudes as we had once seen in  that harbour. In the afternoon I walked about a mile into the country,  to visit an Indian friend, who had, a few days before, come near twenty  miles, in a small canoe, to see me, while the ship lay becalmed. As the  canoe had not left us long before a gale of wind came on, I was alarmed  for the consequence; however, I had the pleasure to find that my friend  had escaped unhurt, though not without some difficulties. I take notice  of this short excursion, merely because it afforded me an opportunity  of observing, that there appeared no change in the disposition or  behaviour of the inhabitants. I saw nothing that could induce me to  think, that they were displeased with our return, or jealous of the  intention of our second visit. On the contrary, that abundant good  nature which had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34645"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 3 (of 6) (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                      THE      HISTORY OF PAINTING      IN      ITALY.

BOOK I.      VENETIAN SCHOOL.      This School would have required no farther illustration from any other  pen, had Signor Antonio Zanetti, in his highly esteemed work upon  Venetian Painting, included a more ample consideration of the artists of  the state, instead of confining his attention wholly to those, whose  productions, ornamenting the churches and other public places, had all  been completed in the city of Venice alone. He has, nevertheless,  rendered distinguished service to any one ambitious of succeeding him,  and of extending the same subject beyond these narrower limits; since he  has observed the most lucid order in the arrangement of epochs, in the  description of styles, in estimating the merits of various painters, and  thus ascertaining the particular rank as well as the age belonging to  each. Those artists then, whom he has omitted to commemorate, may be  easily reduced under one or other of the divisions pointed out by him,  and the whole history enlarged upon the plan which he first laid down.    In cultivating an acquaintance with these additional names, the  memorials collected by Vasari; afterwards, on a more extensive scale, by  the Cavaliere Ridolfi, in his Lives of the Venetian Painters; and by  Boschini, in the _Miniere della Pittura_, in the _Carta del Navegar  Pittoresco_, and in other works: materials drawn from all parts of the  Venetian state--will be of signal advantage to us. No one, it is hoped,  will feel displeased at the introduction of the name of Vasari, against  whom the historians of the Venetian School were louder in their  complaints than even those of the Roman, the Siennese, and the  Neapolitan Schools; all whose causes of difference I have elsewhere  recounted, adding to them, whenever I found them admissible, my own  refutations. These it would be needless now to repeat, in reply to the  Venetian writers. I shall merely observe that Vasari bestowed very ample  commendations upon the Venetian professors, in different parts of his  history, and more particularly in the lives of Carpaccio, of Liberale,  and of Pordenone. Let me add that if he was occasionally betrayed into  errors, either from want of more correct information, or from a degree  of jealousy or spirit of patriotic rivalry, which probably may have  secretly influenced him in his opinions, it will be no difficult task in  the present enlightened period,[1] to substitute the real names, more  exact accounts, and more impartial examinations of the earlier  professors of the school.[2]    In respect to the more modern, up to whose period he did not reach, I  possess historical matter, which, if not very copious, is certainly less  scanty than such as relates to many of the other Schools of Italy.  Besides Ridolfi, Boschini, and Zanetti, it includes the historians of  the particular cities, the same from whom Orlandi selected his various  notices of artists; and among whom none is to be preferred to Signor  Zamboni for the fulness and authenticity of his materials, in his work,  entitled _Fabbriche di Brescia_. I am, moreover, in possession of  several authors who have distinctly treated of the lives, or published  other accounts of those who flourished in their own cities;--such as the  Commendatore del Pozzo, in his notice of the Veronese,[3] Count Tassi of  those of Bergamo, and Signor Verci of the Bassanese artists. And no  slight assistance may also be drawn from the different \"_Guides_,\" or  descriptions of paintings, exhibited in many cities of the state,  although they are far from being all of equal merit. There is the \"Guida  Trevigiana,\" of Rigamonti, that of Vicenza printed by Vendramini Mosca,  that of Brescia by Carboni, and that of Verona, expressly drawn from the  \"_Verona Illustrata_\" of the Marquis Maffei, with the still more  valuable one of Venice, dated 1733, from the able pen of Antonio M.  Zanetti. To these we may likewise add that first published by Rossetti,  now revised and improved by Brandolese, abounding with historical  memoirs of the painters of Padua; and the Guide of Rovigo by Bartoli,  communicating much new and interesting information, which serves to  point out more accurately certain eras among the professors of the art,  while the same may, in part, be observed of that of Bergamo, by the  Dottore Pasta. Nor are these all; for I am not a little indebted to  several notices published in the \"Elogj\" of Signor Longhi, and in some  of the catalogues of private collections; besides other anecdotes, in  part collected by myself, in part[4] communicated by my friends, and in  particular by the very accomplished Sig. Gio. Maria Sasso,[5] who has  already promised to gratify us with his \"Venezia Pittrice,\" accompanied  with designs of the most esteemed paintings of this school, accurately  engraved.      [Footnote 1: It is observed by Signor Bottari, that Giorgio, in his life  of Franco, was too sparing of his praises of Tintoret and Paul Veronese;  and the same might be said also of Gambera, and many others, who  flourished at the same period, or were already deceased when he wrote.  To his opinions have succeeded those of the Caracci, and of many other  distinguished professors of the art, which may be safely relied upon.]    [Footnote 2: There very opportunely appeared, in the year 1800, at  Bassano, a \"Notizia d'Opere di Disegno\"--\"Upon works of Design,\" the  anonymous production, apparently, of some inhabitant of Padua, about  1550. It was published and illustrated by the learned Abbate Morelli,  and contains several anecdotes, relating more particularly to the  Venetian School.]    [Footnote 3: The celebrated painter, Cignaroli, besides drawing up a  complete _Catalogue raisonne_, of the painters of Verona, already  published in the Chronicle of Zagata, vol. iii., left behind him MS.  notes upon the entire work of Pozzo, in the margin.]    [Footnote 4: I have been enabled in this edition, by means of Count Cav.  de Lazzara, to avail myself of a MS. from the pen of Natal Melchiori,  entitled, \"_Lives of the Venetian Painters_,\" drawn up in 1728. The  author is deserving of credit, no less on account of having been himself  a painter, than from his personal acquaintance with the chief part of  those whose lives he commemorated.]    [Footnote 5: This excellent man is now no more, and his work has not  hitherto appeared. That, however, by the Sig. Co. Canonico de Rinaldis,  on the painters of Friuli, we have received. It embraces a much more  correct and enlarged view of that noble school, than we before possessed  in the scantier notices from the pen of Altan. Still he is not always  exact, and he would undoubtedly have written better, had he seen more.  At length, however, we are in possession of the work of Padre M.  Federici, in two volumes, relating to the artists of the \"Marca  Trevigiana,\" accompanied by documents; a work better calculated than the  former to satisfy the expectations of a reader of taste. But, as is  generally the case, when an author hazards new opinions, we are  sometimes compelled to suspend our assent to his conclusions.]            VENETIAN SCHOOL.      EPOCH I.      _The Ancients._      If in the outset of each school of painting I were to pursue the example  held up in the _Etruria Pittrice_, of introducing the account of its  pictures by that of some work in mosaic, I ought here to mention those  of Grado, wrought in the sixth century, distinguished by the name of the  Patriarch Elia, those of Torcello, and a few other specimens that  appeared at Venice, in the islands, and in Terra Firma, produced at  periods subsequent to the increase of the edifices, together with the  grandeur of the Venetian state. But admitting that these mosaics, like  many at Rome, may really be the production of the Greeks; the title of  my work, confined as it is to painting, and to the period of its revival  in Italy, leads me to be little solicitous respecting those more ancient  monuments of the fine arts, remnants of which are to be found scattered  here and there, without any series of a school. I shall still, however,  occasionally allude to them, according as I find needful, were it only  for the sake of illustration and comparison, as I proceed. But such  information ought to be sought for in other works; mine professes only  to give the history of painting from the period of its revival.    The most ancient pictorial remains in the Venetian territories I believe  to be at Verona, in a subterraneous part of the nunnery of Santi Nazario  and Celso, which, however inaccessible to the"]]]
