Howard        [Transcriber's Note: This etext was first published in Weird Tales      December 1935, January, February, March and April 1936.

The long tapers flickered, sending the black shadows wavering along the  walls, and the velvet tapestries rippled. Yet there was no wind in the  chamber. Four men stood about the ebony table on which lay the green  sarcophagus that gleamed like carven jade. In the upraised right hand of  each man a curious black candle burned with a weird greenish light.  Outside was night and a lost wind moaning among the black trees.    Inside the chamber was tense silence, and the wavering of the shadows,  while four pairs of eyes, burning with intensity, were fixed on the long  green case across which cryptic hieroglyphics writhed, as if lent life  and movement by the unsteady light. The man at the foot of the  sarcophagus leaned over it and moved his candle as if he were writing  with a pen, inscribing a mystic symbol in the air. Then he set down the  candle in its black gold stick at the foot of the case, and, mumbling  some formula unintelligible to his companions, he thrust a broad white  hand into his fur-trimmed robe. When he brought it forth again it was as  if he cupped in his palm a ball of living fire.    The other three drew in their breath sharply, and the dark, powerful man  who stood at the head of the sarcophagus whispered: 'The Heart of  Ahriman!' The other lifted a quick hand for silence. Somewhere a dog  began howling dolefully, and a stealthy step padded outside the barred  and bolted door. But none looked aside from the mummy-case over which  the man in the ermine-trimmed robe was now moving the great flaming  jewel while he muttered an incantation that was old when Atlantis sank.  The glare of the gem dazzled their eyes, so that they could not be sure  of what they saw; but with a splintering crash, the carven lid of the  sarcophagus burst outward as if from some irresistible pressure applied  from within, and the four men, bending eagerly forward, saw the  occupant--a huddled, withered, wizened shape, with dried brown limbs  like dead wood showing through moldering bandages.    'Bring that thing _back_?' muttered the small dark man who stood on the  right, with a short sardonic laugh. 'It is ready to crumble at a touch.  We are fools--'    'Shhh!' It was an urgent hiss of command from the large man who held the  jewel. Perspiration stood upon his broad white forehead and his eyes  were dilated. He leaned forward, and, without touching the thing with  his hand, laid on the breast of the mummy the blazing jewel. Then he  drew back and watched with fierce intensity, his lips moving in  soundless invocation.    It was as if a globe of living fire flickered and burned on the dead,  withered bosom. And breath sucked in, hissing, through the clenched  teeth of the watchers. For as they watched, an awful transmutation  became apparent. The withered shape in the sarcophagus was expanding,  was growing, lengthening. The bandages burst and fell into brown dust.  The shriveled limbs swelled, straightened. Their dusky hue began to  fade.    'By Mitra!' whispered the tall, yellow-haired man on the left. 'He was  _not_ a Stygian. That part at least was true.'    Again a trembling finger warned for silence. The hound outside was no  longer howling. He whimpered, as with an evil dream, and then that  sound, too, died away in silence, in which the yellow-haired man plainly  heard the straining of the heavy door, as if something outside pushed  powerfully upon it. He half turned, his hand at his sword, but the man  in the ermine robe hissed an urgent warning: 'Stay! Do not break the  chain! And on your life do not go to the door!'    The yellow-haired man shrugged and turned back, and then he stopped  short, staring. In the jade sarcophagus lay a living man: a tall, lusty  man, naked, white of skin, and dark of hair and beard. He lay  motionless, his eyes wide open, and blank and unknowing as a newborn  babe's. On his breast the great jewel smoldered and sparkled.    The man in ermine reeled as if from some let-down of extreme tension.    'Ishtar!' he gasped. 'It is Xaltotun!--_and he lives!_ Valerius!  Tarascus! Amalric! Do you see? Do you see? You doubted me--but I have  not failed! We have been close to the open gates of hell this night, and  the shapes of darkness have gathered close about us--aye, they followed  _him_ to the very door--but we have brought the great magician back to  life.'    'And damned our souls to purgatories everlasting, I doubt not,' muttered  the small, dark man, Tarascus.    The yellow-haired man, Valerius, laughed harshly.    'What purgatory can be worse than life itself? So we are all damned  together from birth. Besides, who would not sell his miserable soul for  a throne?'    'There is no intelligence in his stare, Orastes,' said the large man.    'He has long been dead,' answered Orastes. 'He is as one newly awakened.  His mind is empty after the long sleep--nay, he was _dead_, not  sleeping. We brought his spirit back over the voids and gulfs of night  and oblivion. I will speak to him.'    He bent over the foot of the sarcophagus, and fixing his gaze on the  wide dark eyes of the man within, he said, slowly: 'Awake, Xaltotun!'    The lips of the man moved mechanically. 'Xaltotun!' he repeated in a  groping whisper.    '_You_ are Xaltotun!' exclaimed Orastes, like a hypnotist driving home  his suggestions. 'You are Xaltotun of Python, in Acheron.'    A dim flame flickered in the dark eyes.    'I was Xaltotun,' he whispered. 'I am dead.'    'You _are_ Xaltotun!' cried Orastes. 'You are not dead! You live!'    'I am Xaltotun,' came the eery whisper. 'But I am dead. In my house in  Khemi, in Stygia, there I died.'    'And the priests who poisoned you mummified your body with their dark  arts, keeping all your organs intact!' exclaimed Orastes. 'But now you  live again! The Heart of Ahriman has restored your life, drawn your  spirit back from space and eternity.'    'The Heart of Ahriman!' The flame of remembrance grew stronger. 'The  barbarians stole it from me!'    'He remembers,' muttered Orastes. 'Lift him from the case.'    The others obeyed hesitantly, as if reluctant to touch the man they had  recreated, and they seemed not easier in their minds when they felt firm  muscular flesh, vibrant with blood and life, beneath their fingers. But  they lifted him upon the table, and Orastes clothed him in a curious  dark velvet robe, splashed with gold stars and crescent moons, and  fastened a cloth-of-gold fillet about his temples, confining the black  wavy locks that fell to his shoulders. He let them do as they would,  saying nothing, not even when they set him in a carven throne-like chair  with a high ebony back and wide silver arms, and feet like golden claws.  He sat there motionless, and slowly intelligence grew in his dark eyes  and made them deep and strange and luminous. It was as if long-sunken  witchlights floated slowly up through midnight pools of darkness.    Orastes cast a furtive glance at his companions, who stood staring in  morbid fascination at their strange guest. Their iron nerves had  withstood an ordeal that might have driven weaker men mad. He knew it  was with no weaklings that he conspired, but men whose courage was as  profound as their lawless ambitions and capacity for evil. He turned his  attention to the figure in the ebon-black chair. And this one spoke at  last.    'I remember,' he said in a strong, resonant voice, speaking Nemedian  with a curious, archaic accent. 'I am Xaltotun, who was high priest of  Set in Python, which was in Acheron. The Heart of Ahriman--I dreamed I  had found it again--where is it?'    Orastes placed it in his hand, and he drew breath deeply as he gazed  into the depths of the terrible jewel burning in his grasp.    'They stole it from me, long ago,' he said. 'The red heart of the night  it is, strong to save or to damn. It came from afar, and from long ago.  While I held it, none could stand before me. But it was stolen from me,  and Acheron fell, and I fled in exile into dark Stygia. Much I remember,  but much I have forgotten. I have been in a far land, across misty voids  and gulfs and unlit oceans. What is the year?'    Orastes answered him. 'It is the waning of the Year of the Lion, three  thousand years after the fall of Acheron.'    'Three thousand years!' murmured the other. 'So long? Who are you?'    'I am Orastes, once a priest of Mitra. This man is Amalric, baron of  Tor, in Nemedia; this other is Tarascus, younger brother of the king of  Nemedia; and this tall man is Valerius, rightful heir of the throne of  Aquilonia.'    'Why have you given me life?' demanded Xaltotun. 'What do you require of  me?'    The man was now fully alive and awake, his keen eyes reflecting the  working of an unclouded brain. There was no hesitation or uncertainty in  his manner. He came directly to the point, as one who knows that no man  gives something for nothing. Orastes met him with equal candor.    'We have opened the doors of hell this night to free your soul and  return it to your body because we need your aid. We wish to place  Tarascus on the throne of Nemedia, and to win for Valerius the crown of  Aquilonia. With your necromancy you can aid us.'    Xaltotun's mind was devious and full of unexpected slants.    'You must be deep in the arts yourself, Orastes, to have been able to  restore my life. How is it that a priest of Mitra knows of the Heart of  Ahriman, and the incantations of Skelos?'    'I am no longer a priest of Mitra,' answered Orastes. 'I was cast forth  from my order because of my delving in black magic. But for Amalric  there I might have been burned as a magician.

THE RESCUE-CONCLUSION          CHAPTER I    AN APPEAL FOR AID      Tom Swift stepped from the door of the machine shop, where he was at  work making some adjustments to the motor of his airship, and  glanced down the road. He saw a cloud of dust, which effectually  concealed whatever was causing it.    \"Some one must be in a hurry this morning,\" the lad remarked, \"Looks  like a motor speeding along. MY! but we certainly do need rain,\" he  added, as he looked up toward the sky. \"It's very dusty. Well, I may  as well get back to work. I'll take the airship out for a flight  this afternoon, if the wind dies down a bit.\"    The young inventor, for Tom Swift himself had built the airship, as  well as several other crafts for swift locomotion, turned to  re-enter the shop.    Something about the approaching cloud of dust, however, held his  attention. He glanced more intently at it.    \"If it's an automobile coming along,\" he murmured, \"it's moving very  slowly, to make so much fuss. And I never saw a motor-cycle that  would kick up as much sand, and not speed along more. It ought to be  here by now. I wonder what it can be?\"    The cloud of highway dirt rolled along, making some progress toward  Tom's house and the group of shops and other buildings surrounding  it. But, as the lad had said, the dust did not move at all quickly  in comparison to any of the speedy machines that might be causing  it. And the cloud seemed momentarily to grow thicker and thicker.    \"I wonder if it could be a miniature tornado, or a cyclone or  whirlwind?\" and Tom spoke aloud, a habit of his when he was  thinking, and had no one to talk to. \"Yet it can hardly be that.\" he  went on. \"Guess I'll watch and see what it is.\"    Nearer and nearer came the dust cloud. Tom peered anxiously ahead, a  puzzled look on his face. A few seconds later there came from the  midst of the obscuring cloud a voice, exclaiming:    \"G'lang there now, Boomerang! Keep to' feet a-movin' an' we sho'  will make a record. 'Tain't laik we was a autermobiler, er a  electricity car, but we sho' hab been goin' sence we started. Yo'  sho' done yo'se'f proud t'day, Boomerang, an' I'se gwine t' keep mah  promise an' gib yo' de bestest oats I kin find. Ah reckon Massa Tom  Swift will done say we brought dis yeah message t' him as quick as  anybody could.\"    Then there followed the sound of hoofbeats on the dusty road, and  the rattle of some many-jointed vehicle, with loose springs and  looser wheels.    \"Eradicate Sampson!\" exclaimed Tom. \"But who would ever think that  the colored man's mule could get up such speed as that cloud of dust  indicates. His mule's feet must be working overtime, but he goes  backward about as often as he moves forward. That accounts for it.  There's lots of dust, but not much motion.\"    Once more, from the midst of the ball-like cloud of dirt came the  voice of the colored man:    \"Now behave yo'se'f, Boomerang. We'm almost dere an' den yo' kin sit  down an' rest if yo' laik. Jest keep it up a little longer, an'  we'll gib Massa Tom his telephone. G'lang now, Boomerang.\"    The tattoo of hoofbeats was slowing up now, and the cloud of dust  was not so heavy. It was gradually blowing away. Tom Swift walked  down to the fence that separated the house, grounds and shops from  the road. As he got there the sounds of the mule's progress, and the  rattle of the wagon, suddenly ceased.    \"G'lang! G'lang! Don't yo' dare t' stop now, when we am most dere!\"  cried Eradicate Sampson. \"Keep a-movin', Boomerang!\"    \"It's all right, Eradicate. I'm here,\" called Tom, and when the last  of the dust had blown away, the lad waved his hand to an aged  colored man, who sat upon the seat of perhaps the most dilapidated  wagon that was ever dignified by such a name. It was held together  with bits of wire, rope and strings, and each of the four wheels  leaned out at a different angle. It was drawn by a big mule, whose  bones seemed protruding through his skin, but that fact evidently  worried him but little, for now the animal was placidly sleeping,  while standing up, his long ears moving slowly to and fro.    \"Am dat yo', Massa Tom?\" asked Eradicate, ceasing his task of  jerking on the lines, to which operation the mule paid not the least  attention.    \"Yes, I'm here, Rad,\" replied Tom, smiling. \"I came out of my shop  to see what all the excitement was about. How did you ever get your  mule to make so much dust?\"    \"I done promise him an extra helpin' ob oats ef he make good time,\"  said the colored man. \"An' he done it, too. Did yo' see de dust we  made?\"    \"I sure did, but you didn't do much else. And you didn't make very  good time. I watched you, and you came along like an ice wagon after  a day's work on the Fourth of July. You were going fast, but moving  slow.\"    \"I 'spects we was, Massa Tom,\" was the colored man's answer. \"But  Boomerang done better dan I 'spected he would. I done tole him yo'd  be in a hurry t' git yo' telephone, an' he sho' did trot along.\"    \"My telephone?\" repeated Tom, wonderingly. \"What have you and your  mule Boomerang to do with my telephone? That's up in the house.\"    \"No, it ain't! it's right yeah in mah pocket,\" chuckled Eradicate,  opening a ragged coat, and reaching for something. \"I got yo'  telephone right yeah.\" he went on. \"De agent at de station see me  dribin' ober dis way, an' he done ast he t' deliber it. He said as  how he ain't got no messenger boy now, 'cause de one he done hab  went on a strike fo' five cents mo' a day. So I done took de  telephone,\" and with that the colored man pulled out a crumpled  yellow envelope.    \"Oh, you mean a telegram,\" said Tom, with a laugh, as he took the  message from the odd colored man.    \"Well, maybe it's telegraf, but I done understood de agent t' say  telephone. Anyhow, dere it is. An' I s'pects we'd better git along,  Boomerang.\"    The mule never moved, though Eradicate yanked on the reins, and used  a splintered whip with energy.    \"I said as how we'd better git along, Boomerang,\" went on the  darkey, raising his voice, \"Dinnah am mos' ready, an' I'm goin' t'  giv yo' an extra helpin' ob oats.\"    The effect of these words seemed magical. The mule suddenly came to  life, and was about to start off.    \"I done thought dat would cotch yo', Boomerang,\" chuckled Eradicate.    \"Wait a minute, Rad,\" called Tom, who was tearing open the envelope  of the telegram. \"I might want to send an answer back by you. I  wonder who is wiring me now?\"    He read the message slowly, and Eradicate remarked:    \"'Taint no kind ob use, Massa Tom, fo' t' send a message back wif  me.\"    \"Why not?\" asked the young inventor, looking up from the sheet of  yellow paper.    \"'Case as how I done promised Boomerang his airman, an' he won't do  nothin' till he has it. Ef I started him back t' town now he would  jest lay down in de road. I'll take de answer back fo' you dis  arternoon.\"    \"All right, perhaps that will do,\" assented Tom. \"I haven't quite  got the hang of this yet. Drop around this afternoon, Rad,\" and as  the colored man, who, with his mule Boomerang, did odd jobs around  the village, started off down the highway, in another cloud of dust,  Tom Swift resumed the reading of the message.    \"Hum, this is rather queer,\" he mused, when having read it once, he  began at it again. \"It must have cost him something to send all this  over the wire. He could just as well have written it. So he wants my  help, eh? Well, I never heard of him, and he may be all right, but I  had other plans, and I don't know whether I can spare the time to go  to Philadelphia or not. I'll have to think it over. An electric  airship, eh? He's sort of following along the lines of my  inventions. Wants my aid--hum--well, I don't know--\"    Tom's musings were suddenly cut short by the approach of an elderly  gentleman, who was walking slowly down the path that led from the  house to the country highway which ran in front of it.    \"A telegram, Tom?\" asked the newcomer.    \"Yes, dad,\" was the reply. \"I was just coming in to ask your advice  about it. Eradicate brought it to"]]]
