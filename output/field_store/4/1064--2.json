Served in the Punjab but left in 1854  to explore Somaliland. Discovered Lake Tanganyika with Burton, and Lake  Victoria independently. Was, with Grant, the first European to cross  equatorial africa. Died 1864.          Editor's Note      John Hanning Speke was a man of thirty-six, when his Nile Journal  appeared. He had entered the army in 1844, and completed ten years of  service in India, serving through the Punjab Campaign. Already he had  conceived the idea of exploring Africa, before his ten years were up,  and on their conclusion he was appointed a member of the expedition  preparing to start under Sir Richard (then Lieutenant Burton) for the  Somali country. He was wounded by the Somalis, and returned to England  on sick leave; the Crimean War then breaking out, be served through it,  and later, December 1856, joined another expedition under Burton. Then  it was that the possibility of the source of the Nile being traced to  one of the inland lakes seems to have struck him.    Burton's illness prevented him accompanying Speke on the latter's visit  to the lake now known as Victoria Nyanza. During this expedition Speke  reached the most southerly point of the lake, and gave it its present  name. Speke arrived back in England in the spring of 1859, Burton being  left behind on account of his illness. The relations between the two had  become strained, and this was accentuated by Speke's hast to publish  the account of his explorations. He was given the command of another  expedition which left England in April 1860, in company with Captain  James Augustus Grant, to ascertain still further if the Victoria Nyanza  were indeed the source of the Nile. He met Sir Samuel Baker, to whom  he gave valuable assistance, and who with his clue discovered the third  lake, Albert Nyanza.    Speke telegraphed early in 1863, that the Nile source was traced.  Returning to England that year he met with an ovation, and addressed a  special meeting of the Geographical Society, and the same year, 1863,  published his \"Journal of the Discovery of the Nile.\" Opposed in  his statements by Burton and M'Queen (\"The Nile Basin, 1864\"), it was  arranged that he and Burton should meet for a debate, when on the very  day fixed, Speke accidentally shot himself while out partridge-shooting.    Sir R. Murchison, addressing the Royal Geographical Society that year,  speaks of Speke's discovery of the source of the Nile as solving the  \"problem of all ages.\"    Only two books were published by Speke--the \"Journal\" of 1863, which  follows, and its sequel--\"What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the  Nile,\" which appeared in the year of his death, 1864.          Introduction.      In the following pages I have endeavoured to describe all that appeared  to me most important and interesting among the events and the scenes  that came under my notice during my sojourn in the interior of Africa.  If my account should not entirely harmonise with preconceived notions as  to primitive races, I cannot help it. I profess accurately to describe  native Africa--Africa in those places where it has not received the  slightest impulse, whether for good or evil, from European civilisation.  If the picture be a dark one, we should, when contemplating these sons  of Noah, try and carry our mind back to that time when our poor elder  brother Ham was cursed by his father, and condemned to be the slave  of both Shem and Japheth; for as they were then, so they appear to be  now--a strikingly existing proof of the Holy Scriptures. But one thing  must be remembered: Whilst the people of Europe and Asia were blessed  by communion with God through the medium of His prophets, and obtained  divine laws to regulate their ways and keep them in mind of Him who  made them, the Africans were excluded from this dispensation, and  consequently have no idea of an overruling Providence or a future  state; they therefore trust to luck and to charms, and think only of  self-preservation in this world. Whatever, then, may be said against  them for being too avaricious or too destitute of fellow-feeling, should  rather reflect on ourselves, who have been so much better favoured,  yet have neglected to teach them, than on those who, whilst they are  sinning, know not what they are doing. To say a negro is incapable  of instruction, is a mere absurdity; for those few boys who have been  educated in our schools have proved themselves even quicker than our own  at learning; whilst, amongst themselves, the deepness of their cunning  and their power of repartee are quite surprising, and are especially  shown in their proficiency for telling lies most appropriately in  preference to truth, and with an off-handed manner that makes them most  amusing.    With these remarks, I now give, as an appropriate introduction to my  narrative--(1.) An account of the general geographical features of the  countries we are about to travel in, leaving the details to be treated  under each as we successively pass through them; (2.) A general view of  the atmospheric agents which wear down and so continually help to reduce  the continent, yet at the same time assist to clothe it with vegetation;  (3.) A general view of the Flora; and, lastly, that which consumes it,  (4.) Its Fauna; ending with a few special remarks on the Wanguana, or  men freed from slavery.          Geography    The continent of Africa is something like a dish turned upside down,  having a high and flat central plateau, with a higher rim of hills  surrounding it; from below which, exterially, it suddenly slopes down  to the flat strip of land bordering on the sea. A dish, however, is  generally uniform in shape--Africa is not. For instance, we find in  its centre a high group of hills surrounding the head of the Tanganyika  Lake, composed chiefly of argillaceous sandstones which I suppose to  be the Lunae Montes of Ptolemy, or the Soma Giri of the ancient Hindus.  Further, instead of a rim at the northern end, the country shelves down  from the equator to the Mediterranean Sea; and on the general surface of  the interior plateau there are basins full of water (lakes), from which,  when rains overflow them, rivers are formed, that, cutting through the  flanking rim of hills, find their way to the sea.          Atmospheric Agents    On the east coast, near Zanzibar, we find the rains following the track  of the sun, and lasting not more than forty days on any part that  the sun crosses; whilst the winds blow from south-west or north-east,  towards the regions heated by its vertical position. But in the centre  of the continent, within 5 deg. of the equator, we find the rains much more  lasting. For instance, at 5 deg. south latitude, for the whole six months  that the sun is in the south, rain continues to fall, and I have heard  that the same takes place at 5 deg. north; whilst on the equator, or rather  a trifle to northward of it, it rains more or less the whole year round,  but most at the equinoxes, as shown in the table on the following page.  The winds, though somewhat less steady, are still very determinable.  With an easterly tending, they deflect north and south, following the  sun. In the drier season they blow so cold that the sun's heat is not  distressing; and in consequence of this, and the average altitude of the  plateau, which is 3000 feet, the general temperature of the atmosphere  is very pleasant, as I found from experience; for I walked every inch  of the journey dressed in thick woollen clothes, and slept every night  between blankets.

It  does so on the equator in the most profuse manner; but down at 5 deg. south,  where there are six months' drought, the case is somewhat different; and  the people would be subject to famines if they did not take advantage of  their rainy season to lay in sufficient stores for the fine: and here we  touch on the misfortune of the country; for the negro is too lazy to do  so effectively, owing chiefly, as we shall see presently, to want of a  strong protecting government. One substantial fact has been established,  owing to our having crossed over ten degrees of latitude in the centre  of the continent, or from 5 deg. south to 5 deg. north latitude, which is this:  There exists a regular gradation of fertility, surprisingly rich on the  equator, but decreasing systematically from it; and the reason why this  great fertile zone is confined to the equatorial regions, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#1)"],[1,"MAN FROM GLENGARRY    A TALE OF THE OTTAWA      By Ralph Connor          DEDICATION    TO THE MEN OF GLENGARRY WHO IN PATIENCE, IN COURAGE AND IN THE FEAR OF  GOD ARE HELPING TO BUILD THE EMPIRE OF THE CANADIAN WEST THIS BOOK IS  HUMBLY DEDICATED          PREFACE      The solid forests of Glengarry have vanished, and with the forests the  men who conquered them. The manner of life and the type of character to  be seen in those early days have gone too, and forever. It is part of  the purpose of this book to so picture these men and their times that  they may not drop quite out of mind. The men are worth remembering.  They carried the marks of their blood in their fierce passions, their  courage, their loyalty; and of the forest in their patience, their  resourcefulness, their self-reliance. But deeper than all, the mark that  reached down to their hearts' core was that of their faith, for in  them dwelt the fear of God. Their religion may have been narrow, but  no narrower than the moulds of their lives. It was the biggest thing in  them. It may have taken a somber hue from their gloomy forests, but  by reason of a sweet, gracious presence dwelling among them it grew in  grace and sweetness day by day.    In the Canada beyond the Lakes, where men are making empire, the sons  of these Glengarry men are found. And there such men are needed. For  not wealth, not enterprise, not energy, can build a nation into sure  greatness, but men, and only men with the fear of God in their hearts,  and with no other. And to make this clear is also a part of the purpose  of this book.

There was still snow in the woods, and with  good sleighing and open rivers every day was golden to the lumbermen  who had stuff to get down to the big water. A day gained now might save  weeks at a chute farther down, where the rafts would crowd one another  and strive for right of way.    Dan Murphy was mightily pleased with himself and with the bit of the  world about him, for there lay his winter's cut of logs in the river  below him snug and secure and held tight by a boom across the mouth,  just where it flowed into the Nation. In a few days he would have his  crib made, and his outfit ready to start for the Ottawa mills. He was  sure to be ahead of the big timber rafts that took up so much space,  and whose crews with unbearable effrontery considered themselves the  aristocrats of the river.    Yes, it was a pleasant and satisfying sight, some three solid miles of  logs boomed at the head of the big water. Suddenly Murphy turned his  face up the river.    \"What's that now, d'ye think, LeNware?\" he asked.    LeNoir, or \"LeNware,\" as they all called it in that country, was Dan  Murphy's foreman, and as he himself said, \"for haxe, for hit (eat),  for fight de boss on de reever Hottawa! by Gar!\" Louis LeNoir was a  French-Canadian, handsome, active, hardy, and powerfully built. He had  come from the New Brunswick woods some three years ago, and had wrought  and fought his way, as he thought, against all rivals to the proud  position of \"boss on de reever,\" the topmost pinnacle of a lumberman's  ambition. It was something to see LeNoir \"run a log\" across the river  and back; that is, he would balance himself upon a floating log, and by  spinning it round, would send it whither he would. At Murphy's question  LeNoir stood listening with bent head and open mouth. Down the river  came the sound of singing. \"Don-no me! Ah oui! be dam! Das Macdonald  gang for sure! De men from Glengarrie, les diables! Dey not hout de  reever yet.\" His boss went off into a volley of oaths--    \"They'll be wanting the river now, an' they're divils to fight.\"    \"We give em de full belly, heh? Bon!\" said LeNoir, throwing back his  head. His only unconquered rival on the river was the boss of the  Macdonald gang.           Ho ro, mo nighean donn bhoidheach,       Hi-ri, mo nighean donn bhoidheach,       Mo chaileag, laghach, bhoidheach,          Cha phosainn ach thu.      Down the river came the strong, clear chorus of men's voices, and soon a  \"pointer\" pulled by six stalwart men with a lad in the stern swung round  the bend into view. A single voice took up the song--           'S ann tha mo run's na beanntaibh,       Far bheil mo ribhinn ghreannar,       Mar ros am fasach shamhraidh          An gleann fad o shuil.      After the verse the full chorus broke forth again--           Ho ro, mo nighean, etc.      Swiftly the pointer shot down the current, the swaying bodies and  swinging oars in perfect rhythm with the song that rose and fell with  melancholy but musical cadence. The men on the high bank stood looking  down upon the approaching singers. \"You know dem fellers?\" said LeNoir.  Murphy nodded. \"Ivery divil iv thim--Big Mack Cameron, Dannie Ross,  Finlay Campbell--the redheaded one--the next I don't know, and yes! be  dad! there's that blanked Yankee, Yankee Jim, they call him, an' bad  luck till him. The divil will have to take the poker till him, for he'll  bate him wid his fists, and so he will--and that big black divil is  Black Hugh, the brother iv the boss Macdonald. He'll be up in the camp  beyant, and a mighty lucky thing for you, LeNoir, he is.\"    \"Bah!\" spat LeNoir, \"Dat beeg Macdonald I mak heem run like one leetle  sheep, one tam at de long Sault, bah! No good!\" LeNoir's contempt for  Macdonald was genuine and complete. For two years he had tried to meet  the boss Macdonald, but his rival had always avoided him.    Meantime, the pointer came swinging along. As it turned the point  the boy uttered an exclamation--\"Look there!\" The song and the rowing  stopped abruptly; the big, dark man stood up and gazed down the river,  packed from bank to bank with the brown saw-logs; deep curses broke from  him. Then he caught sight of the men on the bank. A word of command and  the pointer shot into the shore, and the next moment Macdonald Dubh,  or Black Hugh, as he was sometimes called, followed by his men, was  climbing up the steep bank.    \"What the blank, blank, do these logs mean, Murphy?\" he demanded,  without pause for salutation.    \"Tis a foine avenin' Misther Macdonald,\" said Murphy, blandly offering  his hand, \"an' Hiven bliss ye.\"    Macdonald checked himself with an effort and reluctantly shook hands  with Murphy and LeNoir, whom he slightly knew. \"It is a fery goot  evening, indeed,\" he said, in as quiet a voice as he could command, \"but  I am inquiring about these logs.\"    \"Shure, an' it is a dhry night, and onpolite to kape yez talking here.  Come in wid yez,\" and much against his will Black Hugh followed Murphy  to the tavern, the most pretentious of a group of log buildings--once  a lumber camp--which stood back a little distance from the river, and  about which Murphy's men, some sixty of them, were now camped.    The tavern was full of Murphy's gang, a motley crew, mostly French  Canadians and Irish, just out of the woods and ready for any devilment  that promised excitement. Most of them knew by sight, and all by  reputation, Macdonald and his gang, for from the farthest reaches of the  Ottawa down the St. Lawrence to Quebec the Macdonald gang of Glengarry  men was famous. They came, most of them, from that strip of country  running back from the St. Lawrence through Glengarry County, known as  the Indian Lands--once an Indian reservation. They were sons of the men  who had come from the highlands and islands of Scotland in the early  years of the last century. Driven from homes in the land of their  fathers, they had set themselves with indomitable faith and courage to  hew from the solid forest, homes for themselves and their children that  none might take from them. These pioneers were bound together by ties of  blood, but also by bonds stronger than those of blood. Their loneliness,  their triumphs, their sorrows, born of their common life-long conflict  with the forest and its fierce beasts, knit them in bonds close and  enduring. The sons born to them and reared in the heart of the pine  forests grew up to witness that heroic struggle with stern nature and to  take their part in it. And mighty men they were. Their life bred in  them hardiness of frame, alertness of sense, readiness of resource,  endurance, superb self-reliance, a courage that grew with peril, and  withal a certain wildness which at times deepened into ferocity. By  their fathers the forest was dreaded and hated, but the sons, with  rifles in hand, trod its pathless stretches without fear, and with their  broad-axes they took toll of their ancient foe. For while in spring and  summer they farmed their narrow fields, and rescued new lands from the  brule; in winter they sought the forest, and back on their own farms or  in \"the shanties\" they cut sawlogs, or made square timber, their only  source of wealth. The shanty life of the early fifties of last century  was not the luxurious thing of to-day. It was full of privation, for  the men were poorly housed and fed, and of peril, for the making of the  timber and the getting it down the smaller rivers to the big water was  a work of hardship and danger.
