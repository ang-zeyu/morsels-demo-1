During the last half  of the nineteenth century most of the species of hylids living in the  lowlands of southern Mexico and northern Central America were named  and described. Despite the extensive collecting by Salvin and Godman,  Nelson and Goldman, and the various expeditions of the _Mission  Scientifique_, no members of the genus _Ptychohyla_ were obtained  until 1927, when in the mountains of El Salvador Ruben A. Stirton  found a small tree frog that subsequently was described and named  _Hyla euthysanota_ by Kellogg (1928). Until recently frogs of this  genus were known from few specimens and in the literature by nearly as  many names.    Although I first collected _Ptychohyla_ in 1956, it was not until 1960  that special efforts were made to obtain specimens of this genus. The  summer of 1960 was spent in southern Mexico and Guatemala, where every  accessible stream in the cloud forests was searched for tree frogs,  especially _Ptychohyla_ and _Plectrohyla_. Similar, but less  extensive, investigations were carried out in 1961 and 1962. The  result of this field work is a rather large collection of _Ptychohyla_  representing all of the known species, plus tape recordings of the  breeding calls and tadpoles of all of the species.    Previously, I have discussed the nomenclature of one of the species  (Duellman, 1960) and have described two new species (Duellman, 1961).  In the latter paper I made reference to a future account (this one)  that would deal with the systematics and biology of the entire genus.  Although I have series of specimens, tadpoles, osteological  preparations, and recordings of breeding calls, thereby having a wide  array of data at my disposal, much still remains to be learned about  these frogs, especially about various aspects of their life histories.  Even the validity of the genus is open to question; this problem is  discussed at length in the section beyond entitled \"_Ptychohyla_ as a  Natural Assemblage.\"      Acknowledgments    I am indebted to the following persons for permitting me to examine  specimens in their care: Miguel Alvarez del Toro, Museo Zoologia de  Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico (MZTG); Charles M. Bogert and Richard G.  Zweifel, American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); Doris M. Cochran,  United States National Museum (USNM); Norman Hartweg and Charles F.  Walker, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ); Robert F.  Inger, Chicago Natural History Museum (CNHM); Hobart M. Smith,  University of Illinois Museum of Natural History (UIMNH); Heinz  Wermuth, Zoologisches Museum Berlin (ZMB); and Ernest E. Williams,  Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ). The abbreviations following names  of institutions will be used throughout the text; the Museum of  Natural History at the University of Kansas is abbreviated KU.    Throughout my work on these frogs I have profited from discussions  with L. C. Stuart, who has made many valuable suggestions and with his  characteristic generosity has placed at my disposal his extensive  collections of tadpoles from Guatemala. For his aid I am indeed  grateful. I am grateful to Thomas E. Moore for tapes of breeding calls  of two species.    My own field work was made more enjoyable and profitable through the  assistance of Dale L. Hoyt, Craig E. Nelson, Jerome B. Tulecke, and  John Wellman, all of whom spent many hours in often unsuccessful  attempts to collect specimens and record breeding calls of  _Ptychohyla_. I am indebted to many residents of Mexico, Guatemala,  and El Salvador for permission to work on their land and for providing  shelter, food, and guides. I am especially grateful to Mr. and Mrs.  Horatio Kelly of \"Colegio Linda Vista\" at Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacan,  Chiapas, for a pleasant stay at their school; Jordi Julia Z. of the  Comision del Papaloapan, Ciudad Aleman, Veracruz, for arranging for  field work in northern Oaxaca in 1959; Walter Hannstein and Lothar  Menzel for the use of facilities at Finca La Paz, Guatemala, in 1960;  Alan Hempstead for the use of facilities at Finca Los Alpes, Guatemala  in 1960 and 1961; and Julio Aguirre C. of the Instituto Tropical de  Investigaciones Cientificas, San Salvador, El Salvador, for providing  comfortable working quarters and transportation and guides to the  mountains in northern El Salvador. Without the cheerful efforts of  Jorge A. Ibarra, Director of the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural in  Guatemala, my field work would have been greatly restricted during  politically precarious times in that country. Permits to collect in  Mexico were furnished by the late Luis Macias Arellano of the  Direccion General de Caza. Each of these individuals has my profound  thanks for his indispensable aid.    Field work on hylid frogs in Middle America has been supported by the  National Science Foundation, Grant NSF-G9827, and this is the 9th  publication on the results of study of the material from America.      Materials and Methods    During the course of this study I have examined 247 frogs that I  assign to the genus _Ptychohyla_, plus 40 lots of tadpoles and 12  skeletal preparations. Furthermore, I have examined all of the type  specimens. I have studied each of the species and subspecies in the  field and have examined from seven (_P. euthysanota macrotympanum_) to  33 (_P. spinipollex_) living individuals of each species.    Measurements given in the analysis of data and in the descriptions of  the species are those described by Duellman (1956). In the  descriptions of living colors the capitalized names are from Ridgway  (1912).

OWING to circumstances beyond the control of the Committee of  Publication, or of the Committees on the Pedigrees of the various  classes of stock, it has been impossible to publish the first volume of  the Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-bred Neat  Stock at an earlier day. The desire to obtain as large a representation  of stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the Association as  widely among breeders as they could, has induced the committees on the  various classes of stock to hold open their books, and the delays  incident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in many instances a  long correspondence with owners and breeders, have prevented them from  furnishing the copy to the Publication Committee in season to have the  work finished sooner. Every care has been taken to have the records  perfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful character. It is believed  this has been successfully accomplished, and that the animals here  recorded may be relied upon as of undoubted purity of blood.                                  H. A.

THE pure, improved Short Horn, having become an established variety of  Neat Stock for useful and farm purposes throughout the Northern and  Western States, and proved themselves to be all that can reasonably be  expected of them when established on soil productive of an abundance of  grass, it is desirable to preserve their blood as pure as possible, and  the animals herein inserted have had their pedigrees examined and  approved by the Committee appointed for that purpose. It must be  admitted that the Short Horns present themselves to notice under  circumstances of peculiar interest; possessing in themselves a  combination of desirable qualities, and rendered attractive to the eye  by their splendid frames, and beautiful varied colors, it is not  surprising they have become objects of public interest. Great temptation  is laid before a class of men to manufacture _pure bloods_ to suit their  purposes, being able to afford them at a much less price than a genuine  article. Great facilities are within the reach of all at the present  day, who desire to become acquainted with their history and their great  performance at the shambles, and for the dairy, and general usefulness  as farm stock.    The beef producers, and beef dealers uniformly acknowledge their great  superiority over common stock. In the month of November, 1817, the  improved Durham Short Horn Bull, Young Denton, (963) then sixteen months  old, arrived in Boston, sent out from England by Samuel Williams, of  London, a present to his brother Stephen Williams, of Northboro',  Worcester Co., Mass.; he remained there until 1827 or 1828, when he was  taken to the State of Maine, where he died, April 16, 1830. His Sire was  Denton, (198); his G. Sire Comet, (155); was sold for 1000 guineas in  1810. In 1822, Mr. Williams received the Short Horn Cow, Arabella, from  the same source; her Sire was North Star, (460); Dam, Aurora by Comet,  (155). Both of these animals were bred by that eminent breeder, John  Wetherel, who was one of the four spirited purchasers of Comet (155) in  1810, at the price before mentioned. It has been claimed by those who  have gone before us, that Young Denton (963) was the first improved  Durham Short Horn Bull, imported into the United States. From these two  imported animals sprang a very numerous progeny, and their descendants  are scattered through all of the Northern States. In 1823 the Bull  Admiral, (1608) and Cow Arabella, were sent out from the same herd as a  present from Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, to the Massachusetts Agricultural  Society, who placed them under the charge of E. Hersey Derby, Esq., of  Salem, Mass., who bred from them successfully a few years, when the  stock on hand was sold and removed to Hartford Co., Conn. Many animals  of the present day, trace back to this importation. About the same  period, Israel Monson, Esq., of Boston, a large landholder, brought out  the Cow, Tube Rose, also from the herd of Mr. Wetherel. She produced but  one Heifer in this country, (Rose by Young Denton), which, with her  Mother and Daughter, (Nellie by Admiral, (1608)) died about the year  1830.    In 1823. Mr. John S. Skinner, then editor of the American Farmer,  Baltimore, imported two Heifers, Conquest and Pansey, and a Bull,  Washington, (1566) for Gen. Stephen Van Renselaer, of Albany, N. Y., all  from the herd of Mr. Champion, Blythe, England. Many of their  descendants are recorded in this book, and are scattered through all the  Northern States. All of the above mentioned animals possessed a very  high order of excellence for milking capacity, both quality and  quantity, and their descendants maintain that character in a very high  degree at the present day.
