NEW-YORK, OCTOBER 1, 1851. No. III.          JOHN GODFREY SAXE.    [Illustration]      Every catalogue of English poets embraces the name of Butler, though he was  but the most unpoetical of satirists. If Hudibras is poetry there can be no  difficulty in admitting to this distinction Trumbull's Progress of Dulness  and McFingal, Snelling's Truth, a Gift for Scribblers, Halleck's Fanny,  Osborn's Vision of Rubeta, Lowell's Fable for Critics, and some dozen other  attempts in in this line, by Americans. The disease of the satiric muse in  this country has been the spleen, and the reason why we have had so little  of the healthful humorous rage, ideal and lyrical, of which the old masters  gave us immortal examples, is, that those among us who have attempted this  kind of composition have generally had far more to do with persons than  with manners, have been influenced more by envy and malice than by a  generous scorn of what is ludicrous and mean and criminal. The author of  \"Progress\" has fallen into none of the prevailing sins; he is of the school  of Horace, and has as little as he may to do with fools, while he holds up,  unfolds, and whips, the follies of the day.    John G. Saxe was born in Highgate, Franklin county, Vermont, on the second  day of June, 1816, His youth was passed in rural occupations until he was  seventeen years of age, when he determined to study one of the liberal  professions, and with this view entered the grammar school at St. Albans,  and, after the usual preliminary course, the college at Middlebury, where  he graduated bachelor of arts in the summer of 1839. He subsequently read  law at Lockport in New-York and at St. Albans, and was admitted to the bar  at the latter place in September, 1843, since which time he has been  practising in the courts with more than the average success of young  attorneys, and he is now a leading politician of the democratic party, the  conductor of its local organ, the Burlington Sentinel, and District  Attorney, by the grace of personal popularity--all other candidates on the  same ticket having been defeated.    Mr. Saxe became known as an occasional contributor to the _Knickerbocker  Magazine_, some eight or ten years ago. Among his pieces in that miscellany  is one characteristically remarkable for a sympathetic fitness of phrase,  entitled the Rhyme of the Rail, and beginning:        Singing through the forests,        Rattling over ridges,      Shooting under arches,        Rumbling over bridges,      Whizzing through the mountains,        Buzzing o'er the vale,--      Bless me! this is pleasant,        Riding on the Rail!    In this period he has thrown off scores of epigrams, &c., anonymously,  besides the more ambitious performances acknowledged in the collection of  his Poems, of which we have before us a third edition--showing that their  quality is well appreciated--from the press of Ticknor & Co. The longest of  these is Progress, first published in 1846. In skilful felicities of  language and rhythm, general clear and sharp expression, and alternating  touches of playful wit and vigorous sense, there is nothing so long that is  so well sustained in the hundred and one books of American satire. In the  beginning of it he says finely of our \"glorious tongue:\"        Let thoughts, too idle to be fitly dressed      In sturdy Saxon, be in French expressed;      Let lovers breathe Italian,--like, in sooth,      Its singers soft, emasculate, and smooth;      But for a tongue, whose ample powers embrace      Beauty and force, sublimity and grace,      Ornate or plain, harmonious, yet strong,      And formed alike for eloquence and song,      Give me the English,--aptest tongue to paint      A sage or dunce, a villain or a saint,      To spur the slothful, counsel the distressed,      To lash the oppressor, and to soothe the oppressed,      To lend fantastic Humor freest scope,      To marshal all his laughter-moving troop,      Give Pathos power, and Fancy lightest wings,      And Wit his merriest whims and keenest stings!    And then proceeds with a display of popular follies, and especially of  those most grotesque and offensive, the sham philosophies by which it is  attempted to regenerate society:          Hail, Social Progress! each new moon is rife      With some new theory of social life,      Some matchless scheme ingeniously designed      From half their miseries to free mankind;      On human wrongs triumphant war to wage,      And bring anew the glorious golden age.      \"Association\" is the magic word      From many a social \"priest and prophet\" heard;      \"Attractive Labor\" is the angel given,      To render earth a sublunary Heaven!      \"Attractive Labor!\" ring the changes round,      And labor grows attractive in the sound;      And many a youthful mind, where haply lurk      Unwelcome fancies at the name of \"work,\"      See pleasant pastime in its longing view      Of \"toil made easy\" and \"attractive\" too,      And, fancy-rapt, with joyful ardor, turns      Delightful grindstones, and seductive churns!    In the same vein we are treated with \"novelties which disturb our peace,\"  in literature, fashion, politics, religion, and morals; and every line is  faultless in finish and in wit. The Proud Miss McBride, and The New Rape of  the Lock, are in different veins, but abound in the same exquisite turns,  agreeable images, and comic displays of wisdom. In the New Rape of the  Lock:        The gossips whispered it through the town,      That \"Captain Jones loved Susan Brown;\"        But, speaking with due precision,      The gossips' tattle was out of joint,      For the lady's \"blunt\" was the only point        That dazzled the lover's vision!        And the Captain begged, in his smoothest tones,      Miss Susan Brown to be Mistress Jones,--      Flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones,        Till death the union should sever;      For these are the words employed, of course,      Though Death is cheated, sometimes by Divorce;      A fact which gives an equivocal force        To that beautiful phrase, \"for ever!\"        And Susan sighed the conventional \"Nay\"      In such a bewitching, affirmative way,      The Captain perceived 'twas the feminine \"Ay,\"        And sealed it in such commotion,      That no \"lip-service\" that ever was paid      To the ear of a god, or the cheek of a maid,        Looked more like real devotion!    At the wedding party all the aristocracy of the circle in which the Browns  and Joneses were acquainted came together, and Miss Susan--        To pique a group of laughing girls      Who stood admiring the Captain's curls,        She formed the resolution      To get a lock of her lover's hair,      In the gaze of the guests assembled there,      By some expedient, foul or fair,        Before the party's conclusion.        \"Only a lock, dear Captain!--no more,      'A lock for Memory,' I implore!\"        But Jones, the gayest of quizzers,      Replied, as he gave his eye a cock,      \"'Tis a treacherous memory needs a lock,\"        And dodg'd the envious scissors.        Alas! that Susan couldn't refrain,      In her zeal the precious lock to gain,      From laying her hand on the lion's mane!        To see the cruel mocking,      And hear the short, affected cough,      The general titter, and chuckle, and scoff,      _When the Captain's Patent Wig came off,_        Was really dreadfully shocking!    The Times, a poem read before the Boston Mercantile Library Association, in  1849, Carmen Laetum, recited last year at a meeting of the Alumni of  Middlebury College, and New England Men, delivered before the literary  societies of the New-York University a few weeks ago, are his other most  elaborate productions, and they are all carefully finished and alike in  their chief characteristics. His shorter pieces in a few instances have  touches of sentiment, but this is not his forte; by the definition which  limits poetry to rhythmical creations of beauty, Mr. Saxe can scarcely be  called a poet of great excellence; his distinction is, that he is a wit,  and that he has been eminently successful in giving to his wit a poetical  expression.    As a judicious critic has said of him, \"he unquestionably an _artist_, of a  high order, in the narrow range which he has taken. His comical productions  are beautifully finished. As they stand, they are terse, smooth, and  fluent, and any one who has ever tried his hand at this species of  composition, will readily appreciate the time, labor, and taste, which must  have been expended, to jest so easily, in rhyme.\"          GLASS OF BOHEMIA.    [Illustration]      This beautiful article is manufactured in various places throughout  Germany--most largely amid the very mountainous districts of Bohemia; some  of the best, however, is made in Bavaria and sent to Bohemia, and thence  exported. The materials from which the glass is formed consist chiefly of  the same as those used in England; the manufacturers themselves seem to  believe that there is no difference except in the proportions of the  materials, and in the fuel, which is exclusively wood, and produces, by a  little attention, a more constant and intense heat than can be produced by  any coal; the feeding of the furnace with the latter material, they say,  always creates a change in the temperature detrimental to the fluid above,  and never sufficiently intense. The wooded mountains of Bohemia are  entirely inhabited by a population whose industry, morals, hospitality, and  kindliness of manners, do honor, not only to this rich and beautiful  kingdom, but to the whole human race.

Wild Beasts and their Ways    Reminiscences of Europe, Asia, Africa and America      by Sir Samuel W. Baker  F.R.S., F.R.G.S., etc., etc.  Volume 1          CHAPTER I    THE RIFLE OF A PAST HALF CENTURY    Forty years ago our troops were armed with a smooth-bore musket, and a  small force known as the \"Rifle Brigade\" was the exception to this rule.    The military rifle carried a spherical bullet, and, like all others of  the period, it necessitated the use of a mallet to strike the ball,  which, being a size larger than the bore, required the blow to force it  into the rifling of the barrel in order to catch the grooves.    Sporting rifles were of various sizes, but they were constructed upon a  principle generally accepted, that extreme accuracy could only be  obtained by burning a very small charge of powder.    The outfit required a small mallet made of hardwood faced with thick  buff leather, a powerful loading-rod, a powder-flask, a pouch to contain  greased linen or silk patches; another pouch for percussion caps; a  third pouch for bullets. In addition to this cumbersome arrangement, a  nipple-screw was carried, lest any stoppage might render necessary the  extraction of the nipple.    The charge of powder in ordinary use for a No. 16 bore (which carried an  ounce spherical ball) was 1 1/2 dram, and the sights were adjusted for a  maximum range of 200 yards. Although at this distance considerable  accuracy could be attained at the target upon a quiet day, it was  difficult to shoot with any precision at an unmeasured range owing to  the high trajectory of the bullet. Thus for sporting purposes it was  absolutely essential that the hunter should be a first-rate judge of  distance in order to adjust the sights as required by the occasion. It  was accordingly rare to meet with a good rifle-shot fifty years ago.  Rifle-shooting was not the amusement sought by Englishmen, although in  Switzerland and Germany it was the ordinary pastime. In those countries  the match-rifle was immensely heavy, weighing, in many instances, 16  lbs., although the bullet was exceedingly small.    The idea of non-recoil was paramount as necessary to ensure accuracy.    It will be at once perceived that the rifle was a most inferior weapon,  failing through a low velocity, high trajectory, and weakness of  penetration.    In 1840, I had already devoted much attention to this subject, and I  drew a plan for an experimental rifle to burn a charge of powder so  large that it appeared preposterous to the professional opinions of the  trade. I was convinced that accuracy could be combined with power, and  that no power could be obtained without a corresponding expenditure of  powder. Trajectory and force would depend upon velocity; the latter must  depend upon the volume of gas generated by explosion.    The rifle was made by Gibbs of Bristol. The weight was 21 lbs., length  of barrel 36 inches, weight of spherical belted bullet 3 ounces, of  conical bullet 4 ounces, charge of powder 16 drams. The twist was one  full turn in the length of barrel. The rifling was an exceedingly deep  and broad groove (two grooves), which reduced the difficulty of loading  to a minimum, as the projecting belt enabled the bullet to catch the  channel instantly, and to descend easily when wrapped in a greased silk  patch without the necessity of hammering. The charge of powder was  inserted by inverting the rifle and passing up the loading-rod with an  ounce measure screwed to the end; this method prevented the powder from  adhering to the sides of the barrel, and thus fouling the grooves.    An extraordinary success attended this rifle, which became my colossal  companion for many years in wild sports with dangerous game. It will be  observed that the powder charge was one-third the weight of the  projectile, and not only a tremendous crushing power, but an  extraordinary penetration was obtained, never equalled by any rifle that  I have since possessed.    This weapon was in advance of the age, as it foreshadowed the modern  Express, and the principle was thoroughly established to my own  satisfaction, that a sporting rifle to be effective at a long range must  burn a heavy charge of powder, but the weight of the weapon should be in  due proportion to the strain of the explosion.    When I first visited Ceylon in 1845, there were several renowned  sportsmen who counted their slain elephants by many hundreds, but there  were no rifles. Ordinary smooth-bore shot-guns were the favourite  weapons, loaded invariably with a double charge of powder and a hardened  ball. In those days the usual calibre of a gun was No. 14 or 16. A No.  12 was extremely rare. The charge for No. 16 was 2 3/4 drams of fine  grain powder, and drams for No. 12. Accordingly, the light guns, or  \"fowling-pieces,\" as they were termed, were severely tested by a charge  of 6 drams of the strongest powder with a hardened bullet; nevertheless  I never heard of any failure.    At a short range the velocity and penetration of an ounce spherical  ball, with the heavy powder charge, were immense, but beyond 50 yards  the accuracy was imperfect.    I believe I was the first to introduce rifles into Ceylon, which were  then regarded by the highest authorities in the island as impractical  innovations, too difficult to sight, whereas an ordinary gun could be  used with ball more quickly in taking a snap-shot.    The rifles which I had provided were heavy, the 3 ounce already  mentioned, 21 lbs., and a long 2 ounce by Blisset, 16 lbs. The latter  was a polygroove, the powder charge only 1 1/2 dram when I originally  purchased it. It was wonderfully accurate at short ranges with the small  charge, which I quickly increased to 6 drams, thereby losing accuracy,  but multiplying velocity.    Twelve months' experience with elephants and buffaloes decided me to  order a battery of double-barrelled rifles, No. 10, two-grooved, with 6  drams of fine grain powder, and spherical-belted bullets. These were  most satisfactory, and they became the starting-point for future  experiments.    Shortly before the Crimean War, the musket was abolished, and about 1853  the British army was armed throughout with rifles. The difficulty of a  military rifle lay in the rapid fouling of the barrel, which  necessitated a bullet too small to expand sufficiently to fill the  grooves; this resulted in inaccuracy. Even if the bullet were properly  fitted, it became impossible to load when the barrel began to foul after  a few discharges.    At that time I submitted a plan to the authorities which simplified the  difficulty, and having left the pattern bullet at Woolwich, it quickly  appeared with a slight modification as the \"Boxer bullet.\" My plan  designed a cone hollowed at the base. The bullet was a size smaller than  the bore, which enabled it to slide easily down the barrel when foul.  The hollow base fitted upon a cone of boxwood pointed at the insertion,  but broad at the base, which was larger than the diameter of the hollow  in the bullet. It may be easily understood that although this compound  bullet was smaller than the bore of the rifle, a blow with the ramrod  after loading would drive the conical bullet upon the larger diameter of  the boxwood cone, which, acting like a wedge, would expand the lead,  thus immediately secured within the barrel. The expansion when fired  drove the boxwood into the centre of the bullet, which of necessity took  the rifling.    The Boxer bullet superseded the boxwood plug by the use of a piece of  burnt clay, which was less expensive and equally serviceable.    Before breechloaders were invented, we were obliged to fit out a regular  battery of four double rifles for such dangerous game as elephants,  buffaloes, etc., as the delay in re-loading was most annoying and might  lead to fatal accidents.    In hot damp climates it became necessary to fire off and clean the  entire battery every evening, lest a miss-fire should be the consequence  upon the following morning from the condensation of moisture in the  nipple during night. This was not only great trouble and a wasteful  expenditure of ammunition, but the noise of so many loud reports just at  the hour when wild animals were on the move, alarmed the country.  Trustworthy gun-carriers are always difficult to procure, and it was by  no means uncommon that in moments of danger, when the spare rifles were  required, the gun-bearers had bolted from the scene, and the master was  deserted.    The introduction of breechloaders has made shooting a luxury, and has  obviated the necessity of a large battery of guns. For military purposes  the breechloader has manifold advantages--as the soldier can load while  lying down, and keep up a rapid fire from a secure cover. It was  remarked during the Crimean War that a large proportion of wounded men  were struck in the right arm, which would have been raised above the  head when loading the old-fashioned rifle, and was thus prominently  exposed.    It is not my intention to enter into the minutiae of military rifles,  but I cannot resist the satisfaction with which I regard the triumph of  the small-bore which I advocated through the columns of the Times in  1865, at a time when the idea was opposed by nearly all authorities as  impracticable, owing to the alleged great drawback of rapid fouling.  There can be no doubt that the charge of 70 grains with a small-bore  bullet, '303, will have a"]]]
