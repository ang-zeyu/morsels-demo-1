Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1852, by      CALVIN CUTTER, M. D.,      In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District    of Massachusetts.      C. A. ALVORD, Printer,    No. 15 Vandewater Street, N. Y.          PREFACE.      Agesilaus, king of Sparta, when asked what things boys should learn,  replied, \"Those which they will _practise_ when they become men.\" As  health requires the observance of the laws inherent to the different  organs of the human system, so not only boys, but girls, should  acquire a knowledge of the laws of their organization. If sound  morality depends upon the inculcation of correct principles in youth,  equally so does a sound physical system depend on a correct physical  education during the same period of life. If the teacher and parents  who are deficient in moral feelings and sentiments, are unfit to  communicate to children and youth those high moral principles demanded  by the nature of man, so are they equally incompetent directors of the  physical training of the youthful system, if ignorant of the organic  laws and the physiological conditions upon which health and disease  depend.    For these reasons, the study of the structure of the human system, and  the laws of the different organs, are subjects of interest to  all,--the young and the old, the learned and the unlearned, the rich  and the poor. Every scholar, and particularly every young miss, after  acquiring a knowledge of the primary branches,--as spelling, reading,  writing, and arithmetic,--should learn the structure of the human  system, and the conditions upon which health and disease depend, as  this knowledge will be required in _practice_ in after life.    \"It is somewhat unaccountable,\" says Dr. Dick, \"and not a little  inconsistent, that while we direct the young to look abroad over the  surface of the earth, and survey its mountains, rivers, seas, and  continents, and guide their views to the regions of the firmament,  where they may contemplate the moons of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn,  and thousands of luminaries placed at immeasurable distances, ... that  we should never teach them _to look into themselves_; to consider  their own corporeal structures, the numerous parts of which they are  composed, the admirable functions they perform, the wisdom and  goodness displayed in their mechanism, and the lessons of practical  instruction which may be derived from such contemplations.\"    Again he says, \"One great practical end which should always be kept in  view in the study of physiology, is the invigoration and improvement  of the corporeal powers and functions, the preservation of health, and  the prevention of disease.\"    The design of the following pages is, to diffuse in the community,  especially among the youth, a knowledge of Human Anatomy, Physiology,  and Hygiene. To make the work clear and practical, the following  method has been adopted:--    1st. The structure of the different organs of the system has been  described in a clear and concise manner. To render this description  more intelligible, one hundred and fifty engravings have been  introduced, to show the situation of the various organs. Hence the  work may be regarded as an elementary treatise on anatomy.    2d. The functions, or uses of the several parts have been briefly and  plainly detailed; making a primary treatise on human physiology.    3d. To make a knowledge of the structure and functions of the  different organs _practical_, the laws of the several parts, and the  conditions on which health depends, have been clearly and succinctly  explained. Hence it may be called a treatise on the principles of  hygiene, or health.    To render this department more complete, there has been added the  appropriate treatment for burns, wounds, hemorrhage from divided  arteries, the management of persons asphyxiated from drowning,  carbonic acid, or strangling, directions for nurses, watchers, and the  removal of disease, together with an Appendix, containing antidotes  for poisons, so that persons may know what _should be done_, and what  _should not be done_, until a surgeon or physician can be called.    In attempting to effect this in a brief elementary treatise designed  for schools and families, it has not been deemed necessary to use  vulgar phrases for the purpose of being understood. The appropriate  scientific term should be applied to each organ. No more effort is  required to learn the meaning of a _proper_, than an improper term.  For example: a child will pronounce the word as readily, and obtain as  correct an idea, if you say _lungs_, as if you used the word _lights_.  A little effort on the part of teachers and parents, would diminish  the number of vulgar terms and phrases, and, consequently, improve the  language of our country. To obviate all objections to the use of  proper scientific terms, a Glossary has been appended to the work.    The author makes no pretensions to new discoveries in physiological  science. In preparing the anatomical department, the able treatises of  Wilson, Cruveilhier, and others have been freely consulted. In the  physiological part, the splendid works of Carpenter, Dunglison,  Liebig, and others have been perused. In the department of hygiene  many valuable hints have been obtained from the meritorious works of  Combe, Rivers, and others.    We are under obligations to R. D. Mussey, M. D., formerly Professor of  Anatomy and Surgery, Dartmouth College, N. H., now Professor of  Surgery in the Ohio Medical College; to J. E. M'Girr, A. M., M. D.,  Professor of Anatomy, Physiology, and Chemistry, St. Mary's  University, Ill.; to E. Hitchcock, Jr., A. M., M. D., Teacher of  Chemistry and Natural History, Williston Seminary, Mass.; to Rev. E.  Hitchcock, D. D., President of Amherst College, Mass., who examined  the revised edition of this work, and whose valuable suggestions  rendered important aid in preparing the manuscript for the present  stereotype edition.    We return our acknowledgments for the aid afforded by the Principals  of the several Academies and Normal Schools who formed classes in  their institutions, and examined the revised edition as their pupils  progressed, thus giving the work the best possible test trial, namely,  the recitation-room.    To the examination of an intelligent public, the work is respectfully  submitted by                                                            CALVIN CUTTER.    WARREN, MASS., _Sept. 1, 1852_.          TO TEACHERS AND PARENTS.      As the work is divided into chapters, the subjects of which are  complete in themselves, the pupil may commence the study of the  structure, use, and laws of the several parts of which the human  system is composed, by selecting such chapters as fancy or utility may  dictate, without reference to their present arrangement,--as well  commence with the chapter on the digestive organs as on the bones.    The acquisition of a correct pronunciation of the technical words is  of great importance, both in recitation and in conversation. In this  work, the technical words interspersed with the text, have been  divided into syllables, and the accented syllables designated. An  ample Glossary of technical terms has also been appended to the work,  to which reference should be made.    It is recommended that the subject be examined in the form of  _topics_. The questions in _Italics_ are designed for this method of  recitation. The teacher may call on a pupil of the class to describe  the anatomy of an organ from an anatomical outline plate; afterwards  call upon another to give the physiology of the part, while a third  may state the hygiene, after which, the questions at the bottom of  the page may be asked promiscuously, and thus the detailed knowledge  of the subject possessed by the pupils will be tested.    At the close of the chapters upon the Hygiene of the several portions  of the system, it is advised that the instructor give a lecture  reviewing the anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, of the topic last  considered. This may be followed by a general examination of the class  upon the same subject. By this course a clear and definite knowledge  of the mutual relation of the Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene, of  different parts of the human body, will be presented.    We also suggest the utility of the pupils' giving analogous  illustrations, examples, and observations, where these are interspersed  in the different chapters, not only to induce inventive thought, but to  discipline the mind.    To parents and others we beg leave to say, that about two thirds of  the present work is devoted to a concise and practical description of  the uses of the important organs of the human body, and to show how  such information may be usefully applied, both in the preservation of  health, and the improvement of physical education. To this have been  added directions for the treatment of those accidents which are daily  occurring in the community, making it a treatise proper and profitable  for the FAMILY LIBRARY, as well as the school-room.

He was but of five and  twenty winters, a fair-faced man, yellow-haired, tall and strong; rather  wiser than foolisher than young men are mostly wont; a valiant youth, and  a kind; not of many words but courteous of speech; no roisterer, nought  masterful, but peaceable and knowing how to forbear: in a fray a perilous  foe, and a trusty war-fellow.   His father, with whom he was dwelling  when this tale begins, was a great merchant, richer than a baron of the  land, a head-man of the greatest of the Lineages of Langton, and a  captain of the Porte; he was of the Lineage of the Goldings, therefore  was he called Bartholomew Golden, and his son Golden Walter.    Now ye may well deem that such a youngling as this was looked upon by all  as a lucky man without a lack; but there was this flaw in his lot,  whereas he had fallen into the toils of love of a woman exceeding fair,  and had taken her to wife, she nought unwilling as it seemed.   But when  they had been wedded some six months he found by manifest tokens, that  his fairness was not so much to her but that she must seek to the  foulness of one worser than he in all ways; wherefore his rest departed  from him, whereas he hated her for her untruth and her hatred of him; yet  would the sound of her voice, as she came and went in the house, make his  heart beat; and the sight of her stirred desire within him, so that he  longed for her to be sweet and kind with him, and deemed that, might it  be so, he should forget all the evil gone by.   But it was not so; for  ever when she saw him, her face changed, and her hatred of him became  manifest, and howsoever she were sweet with others, with him she was hard  and sour.    So this went on a while till the chambers of his father's house, yea the  very streets of the city, became loathsome to him; and yet he called to  mind that the world was wide and he but a young man.   So on a day as he  sat with his father alone, he spake to him and said: \"Father, I was on  the quays even now, and I looked on the ships that were nigh boun, and  thy sign I saw on a tall ship that seemed to me nighest boun.   Will it  be long ere she sail?\"    \"Nay,\" said his father, \"that ship, which hight the Katherine, will they  warp out of the haven in two days' time.   But why askest thou of her?\"    \"The shortest word is best, father,\" said Walter, \"and this it is, that I  would depart in the said ship and see other lands.\"    \"Yea and whither, son?\" said the merchant.    \"Whither she goeth,\" said Walter, \"for I am ill at ease at home, as thou  wottest, father.\"    The merchant held his peace awhile, and looked hard on his son, for there  was strong love between them; but at last he said: \"Well, son, maybe it  were best for thee; but maybe also we shall not meet again.\"    \"Yet if we do meet, father, then shalt thou see a new man in me.\"    \"Well,\" said Bartholomew, \"at least I know on whom to lay the loss of  thee, and when thou art gone, for thou shalt have thine own way herein,  she shall no longer abide in my house.   Nay, but it were for the strife  that should arise thenceforth betwixt her kindred and ours, it should go  somewhat worse with her than that.\"    Said Walter: \"I pray thee shame her not more than needs must be, lest, so  doing, thou shame both me and thyself also.\"    Bartholomew held his peace again for a while; then he said: \"Goeth she  with child, my son?\"    Walter reddened, and said: \"I wot not; nor of whom the child may be.\"  Then they both sat silent, till Bartholomew spake, saying: \"The end of it  is, son, that this is Monday, and that thou shalt go aboard in the small  hours of Wednesday; and meanwhile I shall look to it that thou go not  away empty-handed; the skipper of the Katherine is a good man and true,  and knows the seas well; and my servant Robert the Low, who is clerk of  the lading, is trustworthy and wise, and as myself in all matters that  look towards chaffer.   The Katherine is new and stout-builded, and  should be lucky, whereas she is under the ward of her who is the saint  called upon in the church where thou wert christened, and myself before  thee; and thy mother, and my father and mother all lie under the chancel  thereof, as thou wottest.\"    Therewith the elder rose up and went his ways about his business, and  there was no more said betwixt him and his son on this matter.          CHAPTER II: GOLDEN WALTER TAKES SHIP TO SAIL THE SEAS      When Walter went down to the Katherine next morning, there was the  skipper Geoffrey, who did him reverence, and made him all cheer, and  showed him his room aboard ship, and the plenteous goods which his father  had sent down to the quays already, such haste as he had made.  Walter  thanked his father's love in his heart, but otherwise took little heed to  his affairs, but wore away the time about the haven, gazing listlessly on  the ships that were making them ready outward, or unlading, and the  mariners and aliens coming and going: and all these were to him as the  curious images woven on a tapestry.    At last when he had wellnigh come back again to the Katherine, he saw  there a tall ship, which he had scarce noted before, a ship all-boun,  which had her boats out, and men sitting to the oars thereof ready to tow  her outwards when the hawser should be cast off, and by seeming her  mariners were but abiding for some one or other to come aboard.    So Walter stood idly watching the said ship, and as he looked, lo! folk  passing him toward the gangway.  These were three; first came a dwarf,  dark-brown of hue and hideous, with long arms and ears exceeding great  and dog-teeth that stuck out like the fangs of a wild beast.  He was clad  in a rich coat of yellow silk, and bare in his hand a crooked bow, and  was girt with a broad sax.    After him came a maiden, young by seeming, of scarce twenty summers; fair  of face as a flower; grey-eyed, brown-haired, with lips full and red,  slim and gentle of body.  Simple was her array, of a short and strait  green gown, so that on her right ankle was clear to see an iron ring.    Last of the three was a lady, tall and stately, so radiant of visage and  glorious of raiment, that it were hard to say what like she was; for  scarce might the eye gaze steady upon her exceeding beauty; yet must  every son of Adam who found himself anigh her, lift up his eyes again  after he had dropped them, and look again on her, and yet again and yet  again.  Even so did Walter, and as the three passed by him, it seemed to  him as if all the other folk there about had vanished and were nought;  nor had he any vision before his eyes of any looking on them, save  himself alone.  They went over the gangway into the ship, and he saw them  go along the deck till they came to the house on the poop, and entered it  and were gone from his sight.    There he stood staring, till little by little the thronging people of the  quays came into his eye-shot again; then he saw how the hawser was cast  off and the boats fell to tugging the big ship toward the harbour-mouth  with hale and how of men.  Then the sail fell down from the yard and was  sheeted home and filled with the fair wind as the ship's bows ran up on  the first green wave outside the haven.  Even therewith the shipmen cast  abroad a banner, whereon was done in a green field a grim wolf ramping up  against a maiden, and so went the ship upon her way.    Walter stood awhile staring at her empty place where the waves ran into  the haven-mouth, and then turned aside and toward the Katherine; and at  first he was minded to go ask shipmaster Geoffrey of what he knew  concerning the said ship and her alien wayfarers; but then it came into  his mind, that all this was but an imagination or dream of the day, and  that he were best to leave it untold to any.  So therewith he went his  way from the water-side, and through the streets unto his father's house;  but when he was but a little way thence, and the door was before him, him-  seemed for a moment of time that he beheld those three coming out down  the steps of stone and into the street; to wit the dwarf, the maiden, and  the stately lady: but when he stood still to abide their coming, and  looked toward them, lo! there was nothing before him save the goodly  house of Bartholomew Golden, and three children and a cur dog playing  about the steps thereof, and about him were four or five passers-by going  about their business.  Then was he all confused in his mind, and knew not  what to make of it, whether those whom he had seemed to see pass aboard  ship were but images of a dream, or children of Adam in very flesh.    Howsoever, he entered the house, and found his father in the chamber, and  fell to speech with him about their matters; but for all that he loved  his father, and worshipped him as a wise and valiant man, yet at that  hour he might not hearken the words of his mouth, so much was his mind  entangled in the thought of those three, and they were ever before his  eyes, as if they had been painted on a table by the best of limners.  And  of the two women he thought exceeding much, and cast no wyte upon himself  for running after the desire of strange women.  For he said to himself  that he desired not either of the twain; nay, he might not tell which of  the twain, the maiden or the stately queen, were clearest to his eyes;  but sore he desired to see both of them again, and to know what they  were.    So wore the hours till the Wednesday morning, and it was time that he  should bid farewell "]]]
