NEWS PUBLISHING CO., Los Angeles.                  Copyrighted 1913, Under Act of Congress,                        By H. T. Payne          INTRODUCTION      Laws recently enacted by most of the states for the better protection  of the game, imposing a nominal license for the privilege of hunting  it, have enabled us to take a census, as it were, of that vast number  of the American people who enjoy the health-giving sports of the  field. This census reveals the fact, that, of the whole population of  the Pacific Coast, nearly twenty per cent of all those over fifteen  years of age are licensed sportsmen. Add to these the large number of  anglers, not counted in this enumeration, and the rapidly increasing  number of young ladies who are learning to enjoy the exhilarating  sports of the field and stream, and this percentage will be  appreciably increased. It is, therefore, obvious that a study of the  game birds and game fishes must be one of interest to a very large  portion of our people, and especially to the younger generation whose  knowledge of the game they bring to bag is still in the formative  state.    Unlike all other works treating of the birds and fishes, this one is  written from the standpoint of the practical sportsman and angler,  rather than for the student of ornithology or ichthyology. I have,  therefore avoided the use of technical names as much as possible, and  employed in the description of the various species the plainest  language consistent with a clear understanding of their distinguishing  features. I have, however, for the benefit of those who wish to learn  their scientific names and genetic relationship, added after the  description of the members of each family, a tabulated form, giving  the Order, Family, Subfamily and Genus to which the several species  belong; together with their common names, general range and breeding  grounds. A new and convenient feature of ready reference.    The numerous illustrations, which are from photographs of the actual  birds, is a new feature of great importance to the student, as they  give the perfect markings of every feather, and the true gradation of  color as appearing in nature.    That, by placing within the reach of the younger generation of  sportsmen, such knowledge of the game birds and game fishes as I have  gained through more than half a century spent in their pursuit, may,  in a measure, liquidate the deep debt I owe for the many happy hours  and excellent health drawn from the exhilarating sports of the field  and stream, is the earnest wish of                                                      THE AUTHOR.            [Illustration: Taxonomy of Birds]          THE GAME BIRDS OF THE PACIFIC COAST      In describing the game birds of the Pacific Coast, I have included all  those found in any considerable numbers from the British Columbia  line, south to and including the state of Arizona, the Mexican states  of Sonora and Chihuahua and the peninsula of Lower California, for in  some of these less frequented places, game birds are found in great  numbers and great variety. This is especially true in these southern  sections with the quail, for here its voice is heard in all the notes  of the gamut, from the soft, turkey-like call of the mountain species,  the soul-stirring whistle of the bobwhite, or the sharp, decisive  \"can't see me\" of the valley quail, through all the varied changes of  the blue quail family, to the low plaintive note of the massena quail  of Mexico.    While it is not the purpose of this work to give a scientific  classification of the game birds of which it treats, a brief statement  of the manner in which they are grouped and classified by the  ornithologist will materially assist the reader in the study of those  species herein mentioned.    The ornithologist groups all the birds of North America into seventeen  \"Orders\"; each of these including all birds of a similar nature. Some  of these orders are divided into two or more suborders, where, while  clearly belonging to the order, there is yet a sufficient difference  in certain groups of families to justify this further separation. The  next division is the \"family,\" which is again divided into \"genera,\"  and each \"genus\" into \"species.\"    Of the seventeen orders of American birds, the scope of this work  includes only six; for all of the birds, commonly called game birds,  belong to one or the other of the following orders:    The =Gallinae=--All gallinaceous, or chicken-like birds. Of this order  we only have to consider two families: The =Tetraonidae=, composed of  the quail and grouse, and the =Phasianidae=, composed of the turkeys  and pheasants.    The =Anseres=--Lamellirostral, or soft-billed swimmers, such as the  ducks, geese, swans and mergansers, comprising the one family,  =Anatidae=, which is divided into five subfamilies, with four of which  we are concerned, viz.: The =Anatinae=, the fresh-water ducks; the  =Fuligulinae=, the salt-water ducks; the =Anserinae=, the geese and  brant; and the =Cygninae=, the swans.    The =Columbae=--This order has but one family, the =Columbidae=,  composed of the pigeons and doves.    The =Limicolae=--This order has seven families, only three of which I  have mentioned as being of sufficient interest to the sportsmen of the  Pacific Coast to justify a description of them. These are the  =Recurvirostridae=, composed of the stilts and avocets; the  =Scolopacidae=, the snipes, curlews, yellow-legs, willits, marlins,  sandpipers, etc.; and the =Charadridae=, the plovers.    The other two orders, the =Herodiones= and the =Paludicolae=, the first  composed largely of the herons, storks, ibises, and egrets, and the  latter of the cranes, rails gallinules and coots, afford more pleasure  to the sportsman through their stately appearance on his hunting  grounds than as game birds. The coots, however, are not considered  game by our sportsmen.    It is well to state here also, that ornithologists do not always agree  in the classification and nomenclature of birds. One claiming that a  certain species or genus should be separated, while others insist that  there is no reason for such separation. With the one exception of the  California valley quail, I have followed the plan of the American  Ornithologists' Union. In this exception I have followed such good  authorities as Bonapart, Elliott, Ridgeway and Gambel, and given the  California valley quail the generic name of =Lophortyx=, instead of  classing them with the Callipepla, to which belong the scaled quail, a  species with no distinction between the sexes.      THE QUAIL    While the eastern half of the continent has but one genus of quail,  the Pacific Coast, including Mexico, is well supplied with five genera  and eighteen species, to which may be added four subspecies. Nine  species of the genus, =Colinus=, however, and two of the genus,  =Callipepla=, do not come into the United States.    Properly speaking we have no quail in America, all of our so-called  quail being partridges, but the use of the word \"quail\" has become so  common that these birds will, in all probability, be known as quail  for all time. But whatever the name, they are resourceful beyond  comparison, and gamy to the fullest degree; affording with dog and  gun the most enjoyable of all out-door sport.        [Illustration: MOUNTAIN QUAIL      PLUMED QUAIL                   (Oreortyx pictus)   (Oreortyx pictus plumiferus)]      THE MOUNTAIN QUAIL    (Oreortyx pictus)    The mountain quails are the largest and most beautiful of all the  American quails, though the least hunted and the least gamy. There is  but one genus, with one species and two subspecies. Two of these  inhabit the mountains of California and Oregon, and the third, the  high ranges of the peninsula of Lower California. While most of the  sportsmen of the Pacific Coast are conversant with the general  character and coloration of the mountain quail, I believe but few of  them have ever seen the more beautiful species that inhabit the San  Pedro Martir mountains of Lower California.    The present species, given the English name of mountain partridge, by  the ornithologists, and which he has taken for his type, is a small  race found only on the Coast Range from the Bay of San Francisco north  into Oregon, and, therefore, never reaches the high altitudes reached  by its near relatives, the =Oreortyx pictus plumiferus=, to which the  English name, plumed partridge, has been given. In fact, both of these  varieties are plumed, though that of the latter is a trifle the  longer. The fact that the plumed quail ascends the mountains each  spring to heights of from five to eight thousand feet for nesting  purposes, gives it a better claim to the name, mountain, than has the  other variety.    The present species, the mountain quail, is generally found in the  canyons and on the damp hill-sides where ferns are abundant. They have  very little of the migratory habits of the other species, except when  driven down in the winter by the snows. Their habits and general plan  of coloration are so much like those of the other two species that I  shall describe them all together, with the proper mention of wherein  they differ.

Printed in Great Britain by Butler & Tanner Ltd., Frome and London          EDITOR'S PREFACE      This admirable work by the late Rev. C. A. Johns, F.L.S., which is now  offered in a new form, has already proved the making of many a  naturalist and it will be a delight and help to many more nature  lovers who wish to determine a species without recourse to bulky  scientific works.    In editing the present edition I have carefully preserved all Mr.  Johns' delightful personal stories and his descriptions of the birds  and their daily life in their haunts, but I have brought the  scientific arrangement of the species up to date, as well as altered  the nomenclature, in accordance with present-day knowledge and use.    We begin with the Passeres because modern ornithologists are now  nearly all agreed that this order attains the highest Avian  development.    I have rectified statements as to the local distribution of various  species which, with the progress of time and local changes, no longer  apply, and have added facts here and there which I considered of some  value.    The faithful and beautiful presentments made by Mr. William Foster for  this new edition have no need of our commendation to the public.
