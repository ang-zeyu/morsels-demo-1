JEKYLL AND                                    MR. HYDE                                         BY                              ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON          1)                                     STORY OF THE DOOR    MR. UTTERSON the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance, that was  never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in  discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary, and  yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to  his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye;  something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which  spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but  more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with  himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for  vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the  doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance for  others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure  of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined  to help rather than to reprove.    2)    \"I incline to Cain's heresy,\" he used to say quaintly: \"I let my  brother go to the devil in his own way.\" In this character, it was  frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the  last good influence in the lives of down-going men. And to such as  these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a  shade of change in his demeanour.    No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was  undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be  founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a  modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands  of opportunity; and that was the lawyer's way. His friends were  those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his  affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no  aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt, the bond that united him to  Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about  town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in  each other, or what subject they could find in common. It was  reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that  they said nothing, looked singularly dull, and would hail with  obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men  put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief  jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure,  but even resisted the calls    3)    of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted.    It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a  by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and  what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the  week-days. The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed, and all  emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of  their gains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that  thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling  saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms  and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in  contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and  with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and  general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased  the eye of the passenger.    Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east, the line  was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point, a  certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the  street. It was two stories high; showed no window, nothing but a  door on the lower story and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on  the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and  sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell  nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the  recess and struck matches on    4)    the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had  tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no  one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair  their ravages.    Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street;  but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his  cane and pointed.    \"Did you ever remark that door?\" he asked; and when his companion  had replied in the affirmative, \"It is connected in my mind,\" added  he, \"with a very odd story.\"    \"Indeed?\" said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, \"and  what was that?\"    \"Well, it was this way,\" returned Mr. Enfield: \"I was coming home  from some place at the end of the world, about three o'clock of a  black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where  there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after  street, and all the folks asleep--street after street, all lighted  up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church--till at  last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens  and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, I saw  two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a  good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was  running as hard as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the  two ran into one another naturally enough at the    5)    corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man  trampled calmly over the child's body and left her screaming on  the ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see.  It wasn't like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a  view-halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought  him back to where there was already quite a group about the  screaming child. He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but  gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like  running. The people who had turned out were the girl's own family;  and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been sent, put in his  appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened,  according to the Sawbones; and there you might have supposed would  be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken  a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So had the child's  family, which was only natural. But the doctor's case was what  struck me. He was the usual cut-and-dry apothecary, of no particular  age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent, and about as  emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every  time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick and  white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just  as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question,  we did the next best. We told the man we could    6)    and would make such a scandal out of this, as should make his name  stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or  any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time,  as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him  as best we could, for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a  circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle,  with a kind of black, sneering coolness--frightened too, I could  see that--but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. 'If you  choose to make capital out of this accident,' said he, 'I am  naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,' says  he. 'Name your figure.' Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds  for the child's family; he would have clearly liked to stick out;  but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and  at last he struck. The next thing was to get the money; and where  do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?--  whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter  of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts's,  drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can't mention,  though it's one of the points of my story, but it was a name at  least very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but  the signature was good for more than that, if it was only genuine. I  took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole    7)    business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life,  walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out of it  with another man's cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he  was quite easy and sneering. 'Set your mind at rest,' says he, 'I  will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.'  So we all set off, the doctor, and the child's father, and our  friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers;  and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I  gave in the check myself, and said I had every reason to believe it  was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine.\"    \"Tut-tut,\" said Mr. Utterson.    \"I see you feel as I do,\" said Mr. Enfield. \"Yes, it's a bad story.  For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really  damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink  of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of  your fellows who do what they call good. Black-mail, I suppose; an  honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his  youth. Black-Mail House is what I call that place with the door, in  consequence. Though even that, you know, is far from explaining  all,\" he added, and with the words fell into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#1)"],[1,"and the Wizard in Oz        A Faithful Record of Their Amazing Adventures      in an Underground World; and How with the       Aid of Their Friends Zeb Hugson, Eureka         the Kitten, and Jim the Cab-Horse,              They Finally Reached the                  Wonderful Land                      of Oz      by    L.

Zeb Returns to the Ranch          To My Readers      It's no use; no use at all.  The children won't let me stop telling  tales of the Land of Oz.  I know lots of other stories, and I hope to  tell them, some time or another; but just now my loving tyrants won't  allow me.  They cry: \"Oz--Oz! more about Oz, Mr. Baum!\" and what can I  do but obey their commands?    This is Our Book--mine and the children's.  For they have flooded me  with thousands of suggestions in regard to it, and I have honestly  tried to adopt as many of these suggestions as could be fitted into one  story.    After the wonderful success of \"Ozma of Oz\" it is evident that Dorothy  has become a firm fixture in these Oz stories.  The little ones all  love Dorothy, and as one of my small friends aptly states: \"It isn't a  real Oz story without her.\"  So here she is again, as sweet and gentle  and innocent as ever, I hope, and the heroine of another strange  adventure.    There were many requests from my little correspondents for \"more about  the Wizard.\"  It seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in  the first Oz book, in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged  himself \"a humbug.\"  The children had heard how he mounted into the sky  in a balloon and they were all waiting for him to come down again.  So  what could I do but tell \"what happened to the Wizard afterward\"?  You  will find him in these pages, just the same humbug Wizard as before.    There was one thing the children demanded which I found it impossible  to do in this present book: they bade me introduce Toto, Dorothy's  little black dog, who has many friends among my readers.  But you will  see, when you begin to read the story, that Toto was in Kansas while  Dorothy was in California, and so she had to start on her adventure  without him.  In this book Dorothy had to take her kitten with her  instead of her dog; but in the next Oz book, if I am permitted to write  one, I intend to tell a good deal about Toto's further history.    Princess Ozma, whom I love as much as my readers do, is again  introduced in this story, and so are several of our old friends of Oz.  You will also become acquainted with Jim the Cab-Horse, the Nine Tiny  Piglets, and Eureka, the Kitten.  I am sorry the kitten was not as well  behaved as she ought to have been; but perhaps she wasn't brought up  properly.  Dorothy found her, you see, and who her parents were nobody  knows.    I believe, my dears, that I am the proudest story-teller that ever  lived.  Many a time tears of pride and joy have stood in my eyes while  I read the tender, loving, appealing letters that came to me in almost  every mail from my little readers.  To have pleased you, to have  interested you, to have won your friendship, and perhaps your love,  through my stories, is to my mind as great an achievement as to become  President of the United States.  Indeed, I would much rather be your  story-teller, under these conditions, than to be the President.  So you  have helped me to fulfill my life's ambition, and I am more grateful to  you, my dears, than I can express in words.    I try to answer every letter of my young correspondents; yet sometimes  there are so many letters that a little time must pass before you get  your answer.  But be patient, friends, for the answer will surely come,  and by writing to me you more than repay me for the pleasant task of  preparing these books.  Besides, I am proud to acknowledge that the  books are partly yours, for your suggestions often guide me in telling  the stories, and I am sure they would not be half so good without your  clever and thoughtful assistance.    L. FRANK BAUM    Coronado, 1908.          1.  The Earthquake      The train from 'Frisco was very late.  It should have arrived at  Hugson's Siding at midnight, but it was already five o'clock and the  gray dawn was breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled  up to the open shed that served for the station-house.  As it came to a  stop the conductor called out in a loud voice:    \"Hugson's Siding!\"    At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the  car, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cage  covered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked  under her arm.  The conductor helped her off the car and then the  engineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned and  moved slowly away up the track.  The reason he was so late was because  all through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and  trembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the  rails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers.  So  he moved the cars slowly and with caution.    The little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared  around a curve; then she turned to see where she was.    The shed at Hugson's Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and  did not look very inviting.  As she peered through the soft gray light  not a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any  person in sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and  buggy standing near a group of trees a short distance away.  She walked  toward it and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless,  with its head hanging down almost to the ground.  It was a big horse,  tall and bony, with long legs and large knees and feet.  She could  count his ribs easily where they showed through the skin of his body,  and his head was long and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it  did not fit.  His tail was short and scraggly, and his harness had been  broken in many places and fastened together again with cords and bits  of wire.  The buggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side  curtains.  Getting around in front, so that she could look inside, the  girl saw a boy curled up on the seat, fast asleep.    She set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol.  Presently he woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes  briskly.    \"Hello!\" he said, seeing her, \"are you Dorothy Gale?\"    \"Yes,\" she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking  gray eyes.  \"Have you come to take me to Hugson's Ranch?\"    \"Of course,\" he answered.  \"Train in?\"    \"I couldn't be here if it wasn't,\" she said.    He laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank.  Jumping out of  the buggy he put Dorothy's suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage  on the floor in front.    \"Canary-birds?\" he asked.    \"Oh no; it's just Eureka, my kitten.  I thought that was the best way  to carry her.\"    The boy nodded.    \"Eureka's a funny name for a cat,\" he remarked.    \"I named my kitten that because I found it,\" she explained.  \"Uncle  Henry says 'Eureka' means 'I have found it.'\"    \"All right; hop in.\"    She climbed into the buggy and he followed her.  Then the boy picked up  the reins, shook them, and said \"Gid-dap!\"    The horse did not stir.  Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his  drooping ears, but that was all.    \"Gid-dap!\" called the boy, again.    The horse stood still.    \"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, \"if you untied him, he would go.\"    The boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out.    \"Guess I'm half asleep yet,\" he said, untying the horse.  \"But Jim  knows his business all right--don't you, Jim?\" patting the long nose of  the animal.    Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at  once backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot  down the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.    \"Thought that train would never come,\" observed the boy.  \"I've waited  at that station for five hours.\"    \"We had a lot of earthquakes,\" said Dorothy.  \"Didn't you feel the  ground shake?\"    \"Yes; but we're used to such things in California,\" he replied.  \"They  don't scare us much.\"    \"The conductor said it was the worst quake he ever knew.\"    \"Did he?  Then it must have happened while I was asleep,\" he said  thoughtfully.    \"How is Uncle Henry?\" she enquired, after a pause during which the  horse continued to trot with long, regular strides.    \"He's pretty well.  He and Uncle Hugson have been having a fine visit.\"    \"Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?\" she asked.    \"Yes.  Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry's wife's sister; so  we must be second cousins,\" said the boy, in an amused tone.  \"I work  for Uncle Bill on his ranch, and he pays me six dollars a month and my  board.\"    \"Isn't that a great deal?\" she asked, doubtfully.    \"Why, it's a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me.  I'm a  splendid worker.  I work as well as I sleep,\" he added, with a laugh.    \"What is your name?\" said Dorothy, thinking she liked the boy's manner  and the cheery tone of his voice.    \"Not a very pretty one,\" he answered, as if a little ashamed.  \"My  whole name is Zebediah; but folks just call me 'Zeb.'  You've been "]]]
