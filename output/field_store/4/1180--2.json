VOLUME II.    DECEMBER TO MARCH, 1850-51.        NEW-YORK:    STRINGER & TOWNSEND, 222 BROADWAY.    FOR SALE BY ALL BOOKSELLERS.    BY THE NUMBER, 25 CTS.; THE VOLUME, $1; THE YEAR, $3.          PREFACE.      On completing the second volume of the International Magazine, the  publishers appeal to its pages with confidence for confirmation of all  the promises that have been made with regard to its character. They  believe the verdict of the American journals has been unanimous upon the  point that the _International_ has been the best journal of literary  intelligence in the world, keeping its readers constantly advised of the  intellectual activity of Great Britain, Germany, France, the other  European nations, and our own country. As a journal of the fine arts, it  has been the aim of the editor to render it in all respects just, and as  particular as the space allotted to this department would allow. And its  reproductions of the best contemporary foreign literature bear the names  of Walter Savage Landor, Mazzini, Bulwer, Dickens, Thackeray, Barry  Cornwall, Alfred Tennyson, R.M. Milnes, Charles Mackay, Mrs. Browning,  Miss Mitford, Miss Martineau, Mrs. Hall, and others; its original  translations the names of several of the leading authors of the  Continent, and its anonymous selections the titles of the great Reviews,  Magazines, and Journals, as well as of many of the most important new  books in all departments of literature. But the _International_ is not  merely a compilation; it has embraced in the two volumes already issued,  original papers, by Bishop Spencer of Jamaica, Henry Austen Layard,  LL.D., the most illustrious of living travellers and antiquaries, G.P.R.  James, Alfred B. Street, Bayard Taylor, A.O. Hall, R.H. Stoddard,  Richard B. Kimball, Parke Godwin, William C. Richards, John E. Warren,  Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Mary E. Hewitt, Alice Carey, and other authors of  eminence, whose compositions have entitled it to a place in the first  class of original literary periodicals. Besides the writers hitherto  engaged for the _International_, many of distinguished reputations are  pledged to contribute to its pages hereafter; and the publishers have  taken measures for securing at the earliest possible day the chief  productions of the European press, so that to American readers the  entire Magazine will be as new and fresh as if it were all composed  expressly for their pleasure.    The style of illustration which has thus far been so much approved by  the readers of the _International_, will be continued, and among the  attractions of future numbers will be admirable portraits of Irving,  Cooper, Bryant, Halleck, Prescott, Ticknor, Francis, Hawthorne, Willis,  Kennedy, Mitchell, Mayo, Melville, Whipple, Taylor, Dewey, Stoddard, and  other authors, accompanied as frequently as may be with views of their  residences, and sketches of their literary and personal character.    Indeed, every means possible will be used to render the _International  Magazine_ to every description of persons the most valuable as well as  the most entertaining miscellany in the English language.

Robert Blair, D.D. In Grateful Acknowledgment of Many  Kindnesses and Much Pleasant Intercourse          PREFACE      The authority for Haydn's life is the biography begun by the late Dr  Pohl, and completed after his death by E.V. Mandyczewski. To this work,  as yet untranslated, every subsequent writer is necessarily indebted,  and the present volume, which I may fairly claim to be the fullest life  of Haydn that has so far appeared in English, is largely based upon  Pohl. I am also under obligations to Miss Pauline D. Townsend, the  author of the monograph in the \"Great Musicians\" series. For the rest,  I trust I have acquainted myself with all the more important references  made to Haydn in contemporary records and in the writings of those who  knew him. Finally, I have endeavoured to tell the story of his career  simply and directly, to give a clear picture of the man, and to discuss  the composer without trenching on the ground of the formalist.

Haydn's position, alike in music and in musical biography, is almost  unique. With the doubtful exception of Sebastian Bach, no composer of  the first rank ever enjoyed a more tranquil career. Bach was not once  outside his native Germany; Haydn left Austria only to make those  visits to England which had so important an influence on the later  manifestations of his genius: His was a long, sane, sound, and on the  whole, fortunate existence. For many years he was poor and obscure, but  if he had his time of trial, he never experienced a time of failure.  With practical wisdom he conquered the Fates and became eminent. A hard,  struggling youth merged into an easy middle-age, and late years found  him in comfortable circumstances, with a solid reputation as an artist,  and a solid retiring-allowance from a princely patron, whose house he  had served for the better part of his working career. Like Goethe and  Wordsworth, he lived out all his life. He was no Marcellus, shown for  one brief moment and \"withdrawn before his springtime had brought forth  the fruits of summer.\" His great contemporary, Mozart, cut off while yet  his light was crescent, is known to posterity only by the products of  his early manhood. Haydn's sun set at the end of a long day, crowning  his career with a golden splendour whose effulgence still brightens the  ever-widening realm of music.    Voltaire once said of Dante that his reputation was becoming greater and  greater because no one ever read him. Haydn's reputation is not of that  kind. It is true that he may not appeal to what has been called the  \"fevered modern soul,\" but there is an old-world charm about him which  is specially grateful in our bustling, nerve-destroying, bilious age. He  is still known as \"Papa Haydn,\" and the name, to use Carlyle's phrase,  is \"significant of much.\" In the history of the art his position is of  the first importance. He was the father of instrumental music. He laid  the foundations of the modern symphony and sonata, and established  the basis of the modern orchestra. Without him, artistically speaking,  Beethoven would have been impossible. He seems to us now a figure of a  very remote past, so great have been the changes in the world of music  since he lived. But his name will always be read in the golden book of  classical music; and whatever the evolutionary processes of the art may  bring, the time can hardly come when he will be forgotten, his works  unheard.    Rohrau    Franz Joseph Haydn was born at the little market-town of Rohrau, near  Prugg, on the confines of Austria and Hungary, some two-and-a-half  hours' railway journey from Vienna. The Leitha, which flows along the  frontier of Lower Austria and Hungary on its way to the Danube, runs  near, and the district    [Figure: Haydn's birth-house at Rohrau]    is flat and marshy. The house in which the composer was born had been  built by his father. Situated at the end of the market-place, it was in  frequent danger from inundation; and although it stood in Haydn's time  with nothing worse befalling it than a flooding now and again, it has  twice since been swept away, first in 1813, fours years after Haydn's  death, and again in 1833. It was carefully rebuilt on each occasion, and  still stands for the curious to see--a low-roofed cottage, very much  as it was when the composer of \"The Creation\" first began to be \"that  various thing called man.\" A fire unhappily did some damage to the  building in 1899. But excepting that the picturesque thatched roof has  given place to a covering of less inflammable material, the \"Zum Haydn\"  presents its extensive frontage to the road, just as it did of yore.  Our illustration shows it exactly as it is to-day. [See an interesting  account of a visit to the cottage after the fire, in The Musical Times  for July 1899.] Schindler relates that when Beethoven, shortly before  his death, was shown a print of the cottage, sent to him by Diabelli, he  remarked: \"Strange that so great a man should have been born in so poor  a home!\" Beethoven's relations with Haydn, as we shall see later on,  were at one time somewhat strained; but the years had softened his  asperity, and this indirect tribute to his brother composer may readily  be accepted as a set-off to some things that the biographer of the  greater genius would willingly forget.    A Poor Home    It was indeed a poor home into which Haydn had been born; but  tenderness, piety, thrift and orderliness were there, and probably  the happiest part of his career was that which he spent in the tiny,  dim-lighted rooms within sound of Leitha's waters.    In later life, when his name had been inscribed on the roll of fame,  he looked back to the cottage at Rohrau, \"sweet through strange years,\"  with a kind of mingled pride and pathetic regret. Flattered by the great  and acclaimed by the devotees of his art, he never felt ashamed of his  lowly origin. On the contrary, he boasted of it. He was proud, as he  said, of having \"made something out of nothing.\" He does not seem  to have been often at Rohrau after he was launched into the world, a  stripling not yet in his teens. But he retained a fond memory of his  birthplace. When in 1795 he was invited to inspect a monument erected  to his honour in the grounds of Castle Rohrau, he knelt down on the  threshold of the old home by the market-place and kissed the ground his  feet had trod in the far-away days of youth. When he came to make his  will, his thoughts went back to Rohrau, and one of his bequests provided  for two of its poorest orphans.    Genealogy    Modern theories of heredity and the origin of genius find but scanty  illustration in the case of Haydn. Unlike the ancestors of Bach and  Beethoven and Mozart, his family, so far as the pedigrees show, had  as little of genius, musical or other, in their composition, as the  families of Shakespeare and Cervantes. In the male line they were  hard-working, honest tradesmen, totally undistinguished even in their  sober walk in life. They came originally from Hainburg, where Haydn's  great-grandfather, Kaspar, had been among the few to escape massacre  when the town was stormed by the Turks in July 1683. The composer's  father, Matthias Haydn, was, like most of his brothers, a wheelwright,  combining with his trade the office of parish sexton. He belonged to the  better peasant class, and, though ignorant as we should now regard  him, was yet not without a tincture of artistic taste. He had been to  Frankfort during his \"travelling years,\" and had there picked up some  little information of a miscellaneous kind. \"He was a great lover of  music by nature,\" says his famous son, \"and played the harp without  knowing a note of music.\" He had a fine tenor voice, and when the day's  toil was over he would gather his household around him and set them  singing to his well-meant accompaniment.    Haydn's Mother    It is rather a pretty picture that the imagination here conjures up,  but it does not help us very much in trying to account for the musical  genius of the composer. Even the popular idea that genius is derived  from the mother does not hold in Haydn's case. If Frau Haydn had a  genius for anything it was merely for moral excellence and religion and  the good management of her household. Like Leigh Hunt's mother, however,  she was \"fond of music, and a gentle singer in her way\"; and more than  one intimate of Haydn in his old age declared that he still knew by  heart all the simple airs which she had been wont to lilt about"]]]
