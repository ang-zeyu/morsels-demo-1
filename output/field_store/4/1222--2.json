Nevertheless--or perhaps indeed it may have been partly on  that very account--he did not in those opening years read Dante to  any degree worth mentioning: he was well versed in Shakespeare, Walter  Scott, Byron, and some other writers, years before he applied himself  to Dante. He may have been fourteen years of age, or even fifteen (May  1843), before he took seriously to the author of the _Divina Commedia_.  He then read him eagerly, and with the profoundest admiration and  delight; and from the _Commedia_ he proceeded to the lyrical poems and  the _Vita Nuova_. I question whether he ever read--unless in the most  cursory way--other and less fascinating writings of Alighieri, such as  the _Convito_ and the _De Monarchia_.    From reading, Rossetti went on to translating. He translated at an  early age, chiefly between 1845 and 1849, a great number of poems by  the Italians contemporary with Dante, or preceding him; and, among  other things, he made a version of the whole _Vita Nuova_, prose  and verse. This may possibly have been the first important thing  that he translated from the Italian: if not the first, still less  was it the last, and it may well be that his rendering of the book  was completed within the year 1846, or early in 1847. He did not, of  course, leave his version exactly as it had come at first: on the  contrary, he took counsel with friends (Alfred Tennyson among the  number), toned down crudities and juvenilities, and worked to make the  whole thing impressive and artistic--for in such matters he was much  more chargeable with over-fastidiousness than with laxity. Still, the  work, as we now have it, is essentially the work of those adolescent  years--from time to time reconsidered and improved, but not transmuted.    Some few years after producing his translation of the _Vita Nuova_,  Rossetti was desirous of publishing it, and of illustrating the volume  with etchings from various designs, which he had meanwhile done, of  incidents in the story. This project, however, had to be laid aside,  owing to want of means, and the etchings were never undertaken. It was  only in 1861 that the volume named _The Early Italian Poets_, including  the translated _Vita Nuova_, was brought out: the same volume, with  a change in the arrangement of its contents, was reissued in 1874,  entitled _Dante and his Circle_. This book, in its original form, was  received with favour, and settled the claim of Rossetti to rank as a  poetic translator, or indeed as a poet in his own right.    For _The Early Italian Poets_ he wrote a Preface, from which a passage,  immediately relating to the _Vita Nuova_, is extracted in the present  edition. There are some other passages, affecting the whole of the  translations in that volume, which deserve to be borne in mind, as  showing the spirit in which he undertook the translating work, and I  give them here:--    \"The life-blood of rhythmical translation is this commandment--that a  good poem shall not be turned into a bad one. The only true motive for  putting poetry into a fresh language must be to endow a fresh nation,  as far as possible, with one more possession of beauty. Poetry not  being an exact science, literality of rendering is altogether secondary  to this chief law. I say _literality_,--not fidelity, which is by no  means the same thing. When literality can be combined with what is thus  the primary condition of success, the translator is fortunate, and must  strive his utmost to unite them; when such object can only be obtained  by paraphrase, that is his only path. Any merit possessed by these  translations is derived from an effort to follow this principle.... The  task of the translator (and with all humility be it spoken) is one of  some self-denial. Often would he avail himself of any special grace of  his own idiom and epoch, if only his will belonged to him: often would  some cadence serve him but for his author's structure--some structure  but for his author's cadence: often the beautiful turn of a stanza must  be weakened to adopt some rhyme which will tally, and he sees the poet  revelling in abundance of language where himself is scantily supplied.  Now he would slight the matter for the music, and now the music for the  matter; but no, he must deal to each alike. Sometimes too a flaw in the  work galls him, and he would fain remove it, doing for the poet that  which his age denied him; but no, it is not in the bond.\"    It may be as well to explain here a very small share which I myself  took in the _Vita Nuova_ translation. When the volume _The Early  Italian Poets_ was in preparation, my brother asked me (January  1861) to aid by \"collating my _Vita Nuova_ with the original, and  amending inaccuracies.\" He defined the work further as follows: \"What  I want is that you should correct my translation throughout, removing  inaccuracies and mannerisms. And, if you have time, it would be a great  service to translate the analyses of the poems (which I omitted).  This, however, if you think it desirable to include them. I did not  at the time (on ground of readableness), but since think they may be  desirable: only have become so unfamiliar with the book that I have  no distinct opinion.\" On January 25th he wrote: \"Many and many thanks  for a most essential service most thoroughly performed. I have not yet  verified the whole of the notes, but I see they are just what I needed,  and will save me a vast amount of trouble. I should very much wish that  the translation were more literal, but cannot do it all again. _My_  notes, which you have taken the trouble of revising, are, of course,  quite paltry and useless.\"    In order that the reader may judge as to this question of literality, I  will give here the literal Englishing of the Sonnet at p. 38, and the  paragraph which precedes it (I take the passage quite at random), and  the reader can, if he likes, compare this rendering with that which  appears in Dante Rossetti's text:--    \"After the departure of this gentlewoman it was the pleasure of the  Lord of the Angels to call to His glory a lady young and much of  noble[1] aspect, who was very graceful in this aforesaid city: whose  body I saw lying without the soul amid many ladies, who were weeping  very piteously. Then, remembering that erewhile I had seen her keeping  company with that most noble one, I could not withhold some tears.  Indeed, weeping, I purposed to speak certain words about her death,  in guerdon of my having at some whiles seen her with my lady. And  somewhat of this I referred to in the last part of the words which I  spoke of her, as manifestly appears to him who understands them: and  then I composed these two Sonnets--of which the first begins, 'Weep,  lovers'--the second, 'Villain Death.'      [1] _Gentile._ The word means \"noble\" rather than (in its modern         shade of meaning) \"gentle.\" \"Genteel\" would sometimes apply,         but has ceased to be admissible in serious writing.    \"Weep, lovers, since Love weeps,--hearkening what cause makes him  wail: Love hears ladies invoking pity, showing bitter grief outwardly  by the eyes; because villain Death has set his cruel working upon a  noble heart, ruining that which in a noble lady is to be praised in the  world, apart from honour. Hear how much Love did her honouring; for I  saw him lamenting in very person over the dead seemly image: and often  he gazed towards heaven, wherein was already settled the noble soul who  had been a lady of such gladsome semblance.\"    It would be out of place to enter here into any detailed observations  upon the _Vita Nuova_, its meaning, and the literature which has grown  out of it. I will merely name, as obvious things for the English reader  to consult, the translation which was made by Sir Theodore Martin; the  essay by Professor C.
