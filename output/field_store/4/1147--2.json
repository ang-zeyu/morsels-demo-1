NEW-YORK, JUNE 1, 1851. No. III.          HENRY WILLIAM HERBERT, \"FRANK FORESTER.\"    [Illustration]      We doubt whether the wood-engravers of this country have ever produced  a finer portrait than the above of the author of \"The Brothers,\"  \"Cromwell,\" \"Marmaduke Wyvil,\" \"The Roman Traitor,\" \"The Warwick  Woodlands,\" \"Field Sports,\" \"Fish and Fishing,\" &c., &c. It is from  one of the most successful daguerreotypes of Brady.    HENRY WILLIAM HERBERT is the eldest son of the late Hon. and Rev.  William Herbert, Dean of Manchester, and of the Hon. Letitia Allen.  His father was the second son of the second Earl of Carnarvon, who was  of the nearest younger branch of the house of Pembroke. He was a  member of Parliament in the earlier part of his life, and being a  lawyer in Doctors' Commons was largely employed on the part of  American shipmasters previous to the war of 1812. At a later period he  took orders, became Dean of Manchester, was distinguished as a  botanist, and as the author of many eminent works, especially  \"Attila,\" an epic poem of great power and learning. He died about  three years ago. His mother was the second daughter of Joshua, second  Viscount Allen, of Kildare, Ireland,--closely connected with the house  of Leinster.    Mr. Herbert was born in London on the seventh of April, 1807; he was  educated at home under a private tutor till 1819, and then sent to a  private school near Brighton, kept by the Rev. Dr. Hooker, at which he  remained one year he was then transferred to Eton, and was at that  school from April, 1820, till the summer of 1825, when he left for the  university, and entered Caius College, Cambridge, in October. Here he  obtained two scholarships and several prizes,--though not a  hard-reading man, and spending much of his time in field sports--and  he graduated in the winter of 1829-30, with a distinguished reputation  for talents and scholarship. In November, 1831, he sailed from  Liverpool for New York, and for the last twenty years he has resided  nearly all the time in this city and at his place near Newark in New  Jersey, called the Cedars.    [Illustration]    In 1832, in connection with the late A. D. Patterson, he started _The  American Monthly Magazine_, nearly one half the matter of which was  composed by him. After the first year Mr. Patterson retired from it,  and during twelve months it was conducted by Mr. Herbert alone. On the  conclusion of the second year it was sold to Charles F. Hoffman, Mr.  Herbert continuing to act as a joint editor. At the commencement of  the fourth year Park Benjamin being associated in the editorship, it  was contemplated to introduce party politics into the work, and Mr.  Herbert in consequence declined further connection with it.    [Illustration]    By this time Mr. Herbert had made a brilliant reputation as a scholar  and as an author. In the _American Monthly_ he had printed the first  chapters of _The Brothers, a Tale of the Fronde_, and the entire novel  was published by the Harpers in 1834, and so well received that the  whole edition was sold in a few weeks. In 1836 and 1837 he edited _The  Magnolia_, the first annual ever printed in America on the system of  entire originality both of the literary matter, and of the  embellishments, which were all executed by American engravers from  American designs. A considerable portion of the matter for both years  was furnished by Mr. Herbert. In 1837 the Harpers published his second  novel, _Cromwell_, which did not sell so rapidly as _The Brothers_,  though generally praised by the reviewers. It 1840 it was reprinted by  Colburn in London, and was eminently successful. In 1843 he published  in New-York and London his third novel, _Marmaduke Wyvil, or the  Maid's Revenge_, a story of the English civil wars, and in 1848 the  most splendid of his romances, _The Roman Traitor_, founded on the  history of Cataline, a work which must be classed with the most  remarkable of those specimens of literary art in which it has been  attempted to illustrate classical scenes, characters, and manners.    In romantic fiction, besides the above works, Mr. Herbert has written  for the magazines of this country and Great Britain tales and sketches  sufficient to make twenty to thirty stout volumes. The subjects of his  best performances have been drawn from the middle ages and from  southern Europe, and they display besides very eminent capacities for  the historical novel, and a familiarity with the institutions of  chivalry and with contemporary manners hardly equaled in any writer of  the English language.    In 1839 Mr. Herbert commenced in the New-York _Turf Register_ a series  of papers, under the signature of \"Frank Forester,\" from which have  grown _My Shooting Box, The Warwick Woodlands, Field Sports of the  United States and British Provinces_, and _Fish and Fishing in the  United States and British Provinces_--works which by the general  consent of the sporting world are second to none in their department,  in any of the qualities which should distinguish this sort of writing.  The principal distinction between these and all other sporting works  lies in this, that such works in general treat only of game in the  field and flood, and the modes of killing it, while these are in great  part natural histories, containing minute and carefully digested  accounts of every specie of game, beast, bird, and fish, compiled from  Audubon, Wilson, Giraud, Godman, Agassiz, De Kay, and other  authorities, besides long disquisitions into their habits, times of  migration, breeding, &c., from the personal observation and experience  of the author. Any person is at once enabled by them to distinguish  between any two even closely allied species, and to adopt the proper  nomenclature, with a knowledge of the reason for it. The sporting  precepts are admitted, throughout the western country especially, to  be superior to all others, as well as the papers relating to the  breaking and the kennel and field management of dogs, &c. The same may  be said of what he has written of guns and gunnery. Mr. Herbert has  hunted, shot, and fished during the last twenty years in every state  of the Union, from Maine to Maryland, south of the great lakes, and  from below Quebec to the Sault St. Marie northward of them. Not having  visited the southern or south western states, the accounts of sporting  in those regions are collected from the writings or oral  communications of their best sportsmen, and on these points much  valuable new information, especially as to the prairie shooting and  the sports of the Rocky Mountains, will be contained in the new  edition of the _Field Sports_ to appear in the coming autumn.    Besides his contributions to romantic and sporting literature, Mr.  Herbert has written largely in criticism, he has done much as a poet,  and his capacities in classical scholarship have been illustrated by  some of the finest examples of Greek and Latin translation that have  appeared in our time. In the aggregate his works would now make  scarcely less than fifty octavo volumes.    As we have intimated, the portrait at the beginning of this article is  remarkably good. Mr. Herbert is about five feet ten high, of athletic  habits, and an untiring and fast walker; fond, of course, of all field  sports, especially horsemanship and shooting, and priding himself upon  killing as much if not more game than any other gentleman in the  country out of New-York.    [Illustration]          TRENTON FALLS    [Illustration]      In a story called _Edith Linsey_, written by Mr. WILLIS, soon after he  left college, occurs the following description of Trenton Falls:         \"Trenton Falls is rather a misnomer. I scarcely know what       you would call it, but the wonder of nature which bears the       name is a tremendous torrent, whose bed, for several miles,       is sunk fathoms deep into the earth--a roaring and dashing       stream, so far below the surface of the forest in which it       is lost, that you would think, as you come suddenly upon the       edge of its long precipice, that it was a river in some       inner world (coiled within ours, as we in the outer circle       of the firmament,) and laid open by some Titanic throe that       had cracked clear asunder the crust of this 'shallow earth.'       The idea is rather assisted if you happen to see below you,       on its abysmal shore, a party of adventurous travellers;       for, at that vast depth, and in contrast with the gigantic       trees and rocks, the same number of well-shaped pismires,       dressed in the last fashions, and philandering upon your       parlor floor, would be about of their apparent size and       distinctness.         \"They showed me at Eleusis the well by which Proserpine       ascends to the regions of day on her annual visit to the       plains of Thessaly--but with the _genius loci_ at my elbow       in the shape of a Greek girl as lovely as Phryne, my memory       reverted to the bared axle of the earth in the bed of this       American river, and I was persuaded (looking the while at       the _feroniere_ of gold sequins on the Phidian forehead of       my Katinka) that supposing Hades in the centre of the earth,       you are nearer to it by some fathoms at Trenton.

The novelist  has spared no language--has minced no words--to describe the violent  scenes of a violent time.    In some instances facts appear distorted out of their true perspective,  and in others the author makes unwarranted charges.  It is not within our  province to edit the historical side of Dumas, any more than it would be  to correct the obvious errors in Dickens's Child's History of England.  The careful, mature reader, for whom the books are intended, will  recognize, and allow for, this fact.          INTRODUCTION:    The contents of these volumes of 'Celebrated Crimes', as well as the  motives which led to their inception, are unique.  They are a series  of stories based upon historical records, from the pen of Alexandre  Dumas, pere, when he was not \"the elder,\" nor yet the author of  D'Artagnan or Monte Cristo, but was a rising young dramatist and a  lion in the literary set and world of fashion.    Dumas, in fact, wrote his 'Crimes Celebres' just prior to launching  upon his wonderful series of historical novels, and they may  therefore be considered as source books, whence he was to draw so  much of that far-reaching and intimate knowledge of inner history  which has perennially astonished his readers.  The Crimes were  published in Paris, in 1839-40, in eight volumes, comprising eighteen  titles--all of which now appear in the present carefully translated  text.  The success of the original work was instantaneous.  Dumas  laughingly said that he thought he had exhausted the subject of  famous crimes, until the work was off the press, when he immediately  became deluged with letters from every province in France, supplying  him with material upon other deeds of violence!  The subjects which  he has chosen, however, are of both historic and dramatic importance,  and they have the added value of giving the modern reader a clear  picture of the state of semi-lawlessness which existed in Europe,  during the middle ages.  \"The Borgias, the Cenci, Urbain Grandier,  the Marchioness of Brinvilliers, the Marchioness of Ganges, and the  rest--what subjects for the pen of Dumas!\" exclaims Garnett.    Space does not permit us to consider in detail the material here  collected, although each title will be found to present points of  special interest.  The first volume comprises the annals of the  Borgias and the Cenci.  The name of the noted and notorious  Florentine family has become a synonym for intrigue and violence, and  yet the Borgias have not been without stanch defenders in history.    Another famous Italian story is that of the Cenci.  The beautiful  Beatrice Cenci--celebrated in the painting of Guido, the sixteenth  century romance of Guerrazi, and the poetic tragedy of Shelley, not  to mention numerous succeeding works inspired by her hapless fate--  will always remain a shadowy figure and one of infinite pathos.    The second volume chronicles the sanguinary deeds in the south of  France, carried on in the name of religion, but drenching in blood  the fair country round about Avignon, for a long period of years.    The third volume is devoted to the story of Mary Queen of Scots,  another woman who suffered a violent death, and around whose name an  endless controversy has waged.  Dumas goes carefully into the dubious  episodes of her stormy career, but does not allow these to blind his  sympathy for her fate.  Mary, it should be remembered, was closely  allied to France by education and marriage, and the French never  forgave Elizabeth the part she played in the tragedy.    The fourth volume comprises three widely dissimilar tales.  One of  the strangest stories is that of Urbain Grandier, the innocent victim  of a cunning and relentless religious plot.  His story was dramatised  by Dumas, in 1850.  A famous German crime is that of Karl-Ludwig  Sand, whose murder of Kotzebue, Councillor of the Russian Legation,  caused an international upheaval which was not to subside for many  years.    An especially interesting volume is number six, containing, among  other material, the famous \"Man in the Iron Mask.\"  This unsolved  puzzle of history was later incorporated by Dumas in one of the  D'Artagnan Romances a section of the Vicomte de Bragelonne, to which  it gave its name.  But in this later form, the true story of this  singular man doomed to wear an iron vizor over his features during  his entire lifetime could only be treated episodically.  While as a  special subject in the Crimes, Dumas indulges his curiosity, and that  of his reader, to the full.  Hugo's unfinished tragedy,'Les Jumeaux',  is on the same subject; as also are others by Fournier, in French,  and Zschokke, in German.    Other stories can be given only passing mention.  The beautiful  poisoner, Marquise de Brinvilliers, must have suggested to Dumas his  later portrait of Miladi, in the Three Musketeers, the mast  celebrated of his woman characters.  The incredible cruelties of Ali  Pacha, the Turkish despot, should not be charged entirely to Dumas,  as he is said to have been largely aided in this by one of his  \"ghosts,\" Mallefille.    \"Not a mere artist\"--writes M. de Villemessant, founder of the  Figaro,--\"he has nevertheless been able to seize on those dramatic  effects which have so much distinguished his theatrical career, and  to give those sharp and distinct reproductions of character which  alone can present to the reader the mind and spirit of an age.  Not a  mere historian, he has nevertheless carefully consulted the original  sources of information, has weighed testimonies, elicited theories,  and .  .  .  has interpolated the poetry of history with its most  thorough prose.\"                                       WIDGER'S QUOTATIONS                      FROM ALEXANDRE DUMAS CELEBRATED CRIMES            THE BORGIAS  borgs10.txt or borgs10.zip [Etext #2741]    Indeed, Caesar (Borgia) had the power of persuasion as a gift from  heaven; and though they perfectly well knew his duplicity, they had no  power of resisting, not so much his actual eloquence as that air of frank  good-nature which Macchiavelli so greatly admired, and which indeed more  than once deceived even him, wily politician as he was.    At a time when he was besieged on all sides by mediocrities....    Forgetfulness is the best cure for the losses we suffer.    The vice-chamberlain (a Cardinal) one day remarked in public, when  certain people were complaining of the venality of justice, \"God wills  not that a sinner die, but that he live and pay.\"    The same day, the cardinal's mother sent the pope the 2000 ducats, and  the next day his mistress, in man's attire, came in person to bring the  missing pearl.  His Holiness, however, was so struck with her beauty in  this costume, that, we are told, he let her keep the pearl for the same  price she had paid for it.    Roderigo, retired from public affairs, was given up entirely to the  affections of a lover and a father, when he heard that his uncle, who  loved him like a son, had been elected pope under the name of Calixtus  III.  But the young man was at this time so much a lover that love  imposed silence on ambition; and indeed he was almost terrified at the  exaltation of his uncle, which was no doubt destined to force him once  more into public life.            THE CENCI  cenci10.txt or cenci10.zip[Etext #2742]    On the 11th of August, 1492, after the lingering death-agony of Innocent  VIII, during which two hundred and twenty murders were committed in the  streets of Rome, Alexander VI ascended the pontifical throne.  Son of a  sister of Pope Calixtus III, Roderigo Lenzuoli Borgia, before being  created cardinal, had five children by Rosa Vanozza, whom he afterwards  caused to be married to a rich Roman.    Having seen that Beatrice was sentenced to the torture ordinary and  extraordinary, and having explained the nature of these tortures, we  proceed to quote the official report:-- \"And as in reply to every  question she would confess nothing, we caused her to be taken by two  officers and led from the prison to the torture chamber, where the  torturer was in attendance; there, after cutting off her hair, he made  her sit on a small stool, undressed her, pulled off her shoes, tied her  hands behind her back, fastened them to a rope passed over a pulley  bolted into the ceiling of the aforesaid chamber, and wound up at"]]]
