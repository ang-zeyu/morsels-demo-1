If asked why I took in hand a task of such difficulty and delicacy as  that of writing a History of the Church in our Dominion, I can really  find no more truthful answer than that of the schoolboy, \"Please, Sir, I  couldn't help it.\" From boyhood's days in the old country, when a copy  of the Life of Marsden fell into my hands, I felt drawn to the subject;  the reading of Selwyn's biography strengthened the attraction; the  urging of friends in later years combined with my own inclinations; and  thus the work was well on its way when the General Synod of 1913  committed it to my hands as a definite duty.    For the last quarter of a century the Church of this Dominion has indeed  possessed a history by my honoured teacher, Dean Jacobs. That scholarly  volume could hardly be bettered on the constitutional side. In this  department the Dean wrote as one who had taken no mean part in the  events which he describes. His ecclesiastical learning and his judicial  temper rendered him admirably qualified for the task. In working over  the same ground I have perhaps been able to point out a few facts which  he had missed or ignored, but on the whole I have left this part of the  field to him. This is not a constitutional history: it seeks rather to  depict the general life of the Church, and the ideals which guided its  leading figures.    The Dean's description of the missionary period is also an admirable  piece of work, but he had not the advantage of the stores of material  which are now available. Through the indefatigable enthusiasm of the  late Dr. Hocken the journals of the early missionaries have been brought  to this country, and are made available to the student. His  comprehensive collection enables us to come into close touch with days  which are already far distant from our own. Of course the historian must  be guided by the principle, _summa sequi fastigia rerum_; but he cannot  estimate aright the work of the heroic leaders and rulers of the Church  unless he can follow the thoughts and careers of the less conspicuous  agents--the humble missionary or catechist, the native convert or  thinker.    In acknowledging my obligations to the late Dr. Hocken, I would wish to  express my gratitude to the authorities of the Dunedin Museum, where his  library is kept; and also to my friend Archdeacon Woodthorpe, who kindly  placed at my service the unpublished volume in which Dr. Hocken's  researches into the life of Marsden are contained. For permission to  consult the Godley correspondence in the Christchurch Museum I have to  thank the Board of Governors of Canterbury College; and for the loan of  a rare and valuable pamphlet on the death of the Rev. C. S. Volkner I am  greatly indebted to Mr. Alexander Turnbull, of Wellington. Archdeacon  Fancourt, of the same city, has afforded me generous help in recovering  some of the early history of the diocese he has so long served; while,  in Auckland, the Rev. J. King Davis--a descendant of the two  missionaries whose names he bears--has enabled me to identify the  positions of some long forgotten _pas_, and has furnished valuable  information on other points. Other correspondents, from the Bay of  Islands to Otago, have assisted generously with their local knowledge.  Outside of New Zealand I have to acknowledge help from Mrs. Hobhouse, of  Wells, and the Ven. Archdeacon Hobhouse, of Birmingham, the widow and  son of the first Bishop of Nelson.    Many clergy have kindly acceded to my application for photographs of  their churches. A fair number of these I have been able to use, and to  all the senders I desire to express my thanks. For the view of the  ruined church at Tamaki I am indebted to Miss Brookfield, of Auckland,  and for the excellent representation of the scene at the signing of the  Treaty of Waitangi to Mr. A. F. McDonnell, of Dunedin. In the  preparation of the MS. for the press I have been greatly assisted by the  Rev. H. East, Vicar of Leithfield.    But the greatest help of all remains to be told. To the aged and  venerable Bishop Leonard Williams this book owes more than I can  estimate. Not only has he furnished me with abundant information from  the stores of his own unique and first-hand knowledge, but, on many  points, he has engaged in fresh and laborious research. Every chapter  has been sent to him as soon as written, and has benefited immensely by  his careful and judicial criticism. Without this thorough testing my  book would be far more imperfect than it is.    It is due, however, to the bishop, as well as to my readers, to state  emphatically that he is in no way responsible for the views expressed in  this book. There are, in fact, a few points on which we do not quite  agree. The intricacies of high policy or of mingled motive will never  appeal in exactly the same way to different minds. My aim throughout has  been to arrive at the simple truth, and I have often been driven to  abandon long-cherished ideas by its imperative demand.    In the spelling of Maori names Bishop Williams' authority has always  been followed except when a place is looked at from the pakeha or  colonial point of view. Then it is spelt in the colonial manner. Readers  may be glad to be warned against confusing Turanga (Poverty Bay) with  Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty. Similarly, it may be well to call  attention to the wide difference between Tamihana Te Waharoa and  Tamihana Te Rauparaha. Both were notable men, but their characters were  not alike, and they took opposite sides in the great war.    The scope of this book has not permitted me to trace the history of the  Melanesian Mission, nor to deal with the island dependencies of our  Dominion. Even within the limits of New Zealand itself the treatment of  the later period may perhaps seem inadequate. But the events of the  years 1850-1890 have been already covered to some extent in my book,  \"Bishop Harper and the Canterbury Settlement,\" while for the latest  stage of all I have the pleasure of appending to this preface a valuable  letter from the present Primate, whose high office and long experience  enable him to speak with unique authority upon the life of the Church of  to-day.

JOHNSTON AND GERHARD A. SCHAD      The Sacramento Mountains Salamander, _Aneides hardii_ (Taylor), is a  plethodontid of relict distribution in the spruce-fir vegetational  formation from 8500 to 9600 feet elevation in Otero and Lincoln  counties, New Mexico. The salamanders on which most of this report is  based were collected three, four, and six miles northeast of Cloudcroft  in the Sacramento Mountains. Additional individuals were collected on  the eastern slope of Sierra Blanca, 1.5 miles southwest of Monjeau  Lookout, at about 9000 feet, Lincoln County, and in the vicinity of  Summit Springs and Koprian Springs, 9300 feet, Capitan Mountains,  Lincoln County. Certain details concerning the populations in Lincoln  County will be reported elsewhere (Schad, Stewart, and Harrington,  Canadian Jour. Zool., in press).    We would like to thank Mmes. Donna Schad and Lora Lee Johnston, Messrs.  Robert Stewart, Frederick Harrington and Ralph Raitt, and Dr. Robert  Selander for assistance in the field, Dr. W. Frank Blair and Dr. Marlowe  Anderson for the use of specimens in their care, and Dr. A. Byron  Leonard for the identification of the molluscan food items.    In the summer rainy season _A. hardii_ lives in and under downed timber  and under talus accumulations. Occurrence, however, seems to be partly  subterranean and always local; seemingly good habitat frequently appears  to lack the animals. Our observations and collections were made in July,  August, and September in 1956, 1957, and 1958. Two hundred seventy-seven  individuals were taken; these were measured, sexed and examined for  breeding status. The food and parasite content of the guts of a few  individuals was determined. Thirteen salamanders were kept for varying  lengths of time in captivity. The specimens are now stored in  collections at New Mexico State University, University of Texas, Museum  of Vertebrate Zoology, and the Museum of Natural History, University of  Kansas.    The primary study and collecting sites were four and six miles northeast  of Cloudcroft, Otero County, at 8600 to 8800 feet in elevation.  Vegetation was either almost pure stands of Englemann spruce (_Picea  englemanni_) or mixed stands of spruce, Douglas fir (_Pseudotsuga  taxifolia_) and white fir (_Abies_ sp.). At each locality small oaks  (_Quercus_) were present among the dominant conifers. Most of the  salamanders found were in downed Douglas fir logs; some were taken from  spruce and others from cracks in a variety of deadwood. In the less  deteriorated logs the salamanders lived under the loose bark or in small  cracks and chambers near the inner bark surface. In large fir logs in  advanced stages of decomposition, salamanders could be found to the  very centers. This kind of log was apparently highly favorable for  salamanders, for it was in such sites that we found notably large  numbers of the animals and most of the clutches of eggs that we  collected; this kind of log is not frequently found, for its wood is  saturated with water and completely punky and nearly ready for final  collapse.    In winter, salamanders that spent the summer at the surface presumably  move to subterranean cavities, or, at least, to sites away from winter  freezing. In December, 1957, and April, 1958, four feet of snow covered  our collecting sites, and the downed logs contained ice. A few logs were  wet at the surfaces where sunlight hit them, but just under such melt  they were icy. On May 3, 1958, snow was in isolated drifts and the  centers of the logs were still icy. On May 31, and June 22, 1958, there  was no ice anywhere, but no salamanders were evident. Late June is,  however, around the earliest time that _A. hardii_ emerges (Taylor,  1941).      Food and Foraging Behavior    We identified the contents of stomachs from 16 salamanders collected in  1956 and 1957; the items found in them are listed in Table 1. It is not  likely that this list is complete for prey species because _A. hardii_  eats a variety of food and probably takes prey almost indiscriminately  if it is of appropriate size. The kind of food most frequently eaten  was ants; they comprised almost 40 per cent of the total items.  Nevertheless, less than half the stomachs contained ants; this may mean  that salamanders do not make an effort to take ants over any other prey.  Such foraging behavior would result in random capture of ants, and it is  noteworthy that the frequency distribution of ants in stomachs suggests  a Poisson distribution, a mathematical description of one kind of random  distribution.

Beetles eaten were small  representatives of beetle groups likely to occur in or under logs. A  relatively large species of spider was found in nine stomachs; it  represented only ten per cent of the items taken but was one of the most  important foods when mass is considered.    Two adult salamanders not included in Table 1 were found, in the course  of examination for parasites, to have empty stomachs. One was a male,  and the other was a female taken from a chamber that held an egg  cluster. It would not be surprising regularly to find stomachs empty in  \"incubating\" females, but the fact is that the one other such female  collected by us had a small amount of food in the gut; probably these  individuals take anything that enters the egg chamber, but do not leave  for active pursuit of food.    Foraging behavior of captive salamanders was observed by one of us. The  salamanders were maintained in a seven-gallon aquarium, the floor of  which was covered with soil, mosses, liverworts, certain flowering  plants, and pieces of rotten fir log. The salamanders were placed in  the terrarium in September, 1956, July, 1957, and October, 1958; one  individual lived 13 months, another 14 months.    A variety of natural foods was present in the soil and plant matter  placed in the terrarium, and these were presumably eaten as found by the  salamanders. However, the great bulk of the food used by the salamanders  was introduced for them, in the form of colonies of _Drosophila  melanogaster_ in half-pint milk bottles. We tried to keep thriving  colonies of flies, primarily of the mutant vestigial-winged type,  present in the terrarium; in 1957 this was successful to the extent that  there appeared to be a surplus of food available at all times. We did  not attempt to feed the salamanders any wholly artificial food, such as  ground beef.    Initially, the salamanders, although seemingly healthy and well-fed,  were not fat. Those that we maintained on a presumably minimal diet  remained slender and did not grow in length. Two individuals captured  in 1957, however, were maintained on food in excess, and these grew in  length and in girth; from an initial size of about 37 mm. snout-vent  length (a subadult size) they attained about 45 mm. snout-vent length  (an adult size) in a period of five months. The observations on foraging  behavior were made primarily on these"]]]
