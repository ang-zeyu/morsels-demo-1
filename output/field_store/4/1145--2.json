Dixon, Winnsboro, S.C._    \"I was born four miles southwest of where I is now, on de other side of  Woodward Station. I was a slave of old Marster John Mobley, de richest  man, de larges' land owner, and wid more niggers than any other white  man in de county. He was de seventh son of de seventh son, so he  allowed, and you knows dat's a sign of a big family, lots of cows,  mules, horses, money, chillun and everything dat's worth havin'. He had  a good wife too; dis de way he got her, he say. She de daughter of old  Maj. Andy McLean, who got a body full of bullets in de Revolution; he  didn't want Katie to marry Marster John. Marster John git on a mule and  ride up in de night. Miss Katie runned out, jump up behin' him, run away  and marry Marster John. They had de same birthday, March 27th, but  Marster John two years older than Miss Katie. Dat day was looked to,  same as Christmas, every year dat come. Big times then, I tell you!    \"My mistress had long hair, techin' de floor and could dance, so Marster  John said, wid a glass of water on top of her head. Marster John got  'ligion and went all de way lak de jailer in de Bible. All de house  jined wid him and mos' of de slaves. It was Baptist and he built a  spankin' good church buildin' down de road, all out of his own money,  and de cemetery dere yet. He called it 'Fellowship.' Some fine  tombstones in dere yet. De finest cost two thousand dollars, dat's his  daughter Nancy's tomb. Marster John and my old mistress buried in dere.    \"When my younges' mistress, name Marion Rebecca, married her second  cousin, Marster Edward P. Mobley, I was give to her and went wid them to  de June place. It was called dat because old Doctor June built it and  sold it to Marster Ed. I nussed her first chillun: Edward, Moses Hill,  John and Katie. It was a large, two-story frame house, with chimneys at  each gable end. Marster Edward got to be as rich as old marster; he  owned de June place, de Rochelle plantation, de Peay place and de  Roebuck place. Yes sir, course us had overseers for so many slaves and  plantations. I 'member Mr. Oze Brown, Mr. Neely and Mr. Tim Gladney. In  course of time I was took off de nussin' and put to de field. I drapped  cotton seed, hoed some, and picked cotton.    \"I don't 'member no poor buckra, outside de overeeers, 'cept a Mr. Reed  dat lived down on wateroe, passin' our house sometime. He was a  Godforsaken lookin' man dat marster or mistress always give somethin'.    \"Our neighbors was de Pearys, de Durhams, de Picketts, de Barbers and  Boulwares. Doctor Henry Gibson was our doctor. All dese folks kep' a  pack of hounds to run deer and foxes. Yes, I has eat many pieces of  deer. Good? I wouldn't fool you, taste it and you'll hunger for it ever  afterward.    \"Yes sir, at certain times we worked long and hard, and you had to be  'ticular. De only whipping I got was for chopping down a good corn stalk  near a stump in a new ground. Marster never sold a slave but swaps were  made wid kin people to advantage, slaves' wives and husbands sometimes.  I never learned to read or write. I went to White Poplar Springs Church,  de Baptist church my mistress 'tended. De preacher was Mr. Cartledge. He  allowed Miss Marion was de flower of his flock.    \"Slaves lived in quarters, a stretch of small houses off from de White  House. Patrollers often come to search for stray slaves; wouldn't take  your word for it. They would search de house. If they ketch one widout a  pass, they whipped him. We got most our outside news Sunday at church.  When farm work was not pressing, we got all of Saturday to clean up  'round de houses, and wash and iron our clothes.    \"Everything lively at Christmas time, dances wid fiddles, pattin' and  stick rattlin', but when I jined de church, I quit dancin'.    \"After de war, a man came along on a red horse; he was dressed in a blue  uniform and told us we was free. De Yankees dat I 'members was not  gentlefolks. They stole everything they could take and de meanest thing  I ever see was shoats they half killed, cut off de hams, and left de  other parts quiverin' on de ground.    \"I married Mose Jackson, after freedom, and had a boy, Henry. Last I  heard, he was at Shelby, North Carolina. We had a daughter, Mary, she  married Eph Brown. She had ten chillun, many gran' chillun, they's my  great-gran' chillun. My mistress was a good Christian woman, she give me  a big supper when I was married. Her house, durin' de war, always had  some sick or wounded soldier. I 'member her brother, Zed, come home wid  a leg gone. Her cousin, Theodore, was dere wid a part of his jaw gone.  My mistress could play de piano and sing de old songs. I 'members  Marster Theodore had trouble wid de words. Dere was a song called  'Jaunita', 'bout a fountain. Marster Theodore would try hard, but would  say, everytime, 'Jawneeta', and de folks would laugh but mistress never  would crack a smile but just go on wid another song. I thinks everybody  should jine de church and then live right. Have prayers in de family  befo' gitting in de bed. It would have good change, 'specially in de  towns I thinks.    \"Yes, women in family way worked up to near de time, but guess Doctor  Gibson knowed his business. Just befo' de time, they was took out and  put in de cardin' and spinnin' rooms.    \"Yes, I see folks put irons in de fire and some throw a big chunk of  fire into de yard to make de screech owl stop his scary sounds.    \"Befo' I forgits, Marster Edward bought a slave in Tennessee just 'cause  he could play de fiddle. Named him 'Tennessee Ike' and he played 'long  wid Ben Murray, another fiddler. Sometime all of us would be called up  into de front yard to play and dance and sing for Miss Marion, de  chillun and visitors. I was much happier them days than now.

She is quite an actor  and a tireless teller of yarns. She still ties her head up in a white  rag and has large eyes set far apart and a very flat nose. She is ebony  colored. She is a firm believer in her religion and she enjoys shouting  on any occasion for joy or for sorrow.    \"White folks tells stories 'bout 'ligion. Dey tells stories 'bout it  kaise dey's 'fraid of it. I stays independent of what white folks tells  me when I shouts. De Spirit moves me every day, dat's how I stays in.  White folks don't feel sech as I does; so dey stays out. Can't serve God  all de time; allus something getting in de way. Dey tries me and den I  suddenly draps back to serving de Holy God. Never does it make no  difference how I's tossed about. Jesus, He comes and saves me everytime.

Metabolic  Adaptation to Climate and Distribution of the Raccoon _Procyon lotor_  and Other Procyonidae. _Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology_, number  542, 34 pages, 8 figures, 12 tables, 1993.--Although the family  Procyonidae is largely a Neotropical group, the North American  raccoon, _Procyon lotor_, is more versatile in its use of climate, and  it is found in nearly every habitat from Panama to 60 deg.N in Canada. We  hypothesized that most contemporary procyonids have remained in tropic  and subtropic climates because they have retained the metabolic  characteristics of their warm-adapted ancestors, whereas _Procyon  lotor_ evolved a different set of adaptations that have enabled it to  generalize its use of habitats and climates. To test this hypothesis  we compared _Procyon lotor_ with several other procyonids  (_Bassariscus astutus_, _Nasua nasua_, _Nasua narica_, _Procyon  cancrivorus_, and _Potos flavus_) with respect to (1) basal metabolic  rate ([.H]_{b}), (2) minimum wet thermal conductance (C_{mw}), (3)  diversity of diet (D_{d}), (4) intrinsic rate of natural increase  (r_{max}), and, where possible, (5) capacity for evaporative cooling  (E_{c}). We measured basal and thermoregulatory metabolism,  evaporative water loss, and body temperature of both sexes of _Procyon  lotor_ from north central Virginia, in summer and winter. Metabolic  data for other procyonids were from literature, as were dietary and  reproductive data for all species.    Procyon lotor differed from other procyonids in all five  variables. (1) _Procyon lotor_'s mass specific [.H]_{b} (0.46  mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1}) was 1.45 to 1.86 times greater than values for  other procyonids. (2) Because of its annual molt, _Procyon lotor_'s  C_{mw} was about 49% higher in summer than winter, 0.0256 and 0.0172  mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1}. deg.C^{-1}, respectively. The ratio of measured to  predicted C_{mw} for _Procyon lotor_ in winter (1.15) was similar to  values calculated for _Potos flavus_ (1.02) and _Procyon cancrivorus_  (1.25). Values for other procyonids were higher than this, but less  than the value for _Procyon lotor_ (1.76) in summer. On a mass  specific basis, _Bassariscus astutus_ had the lowest C_{mw} with a  ratio of 0.85. (3) _Procyon lotor_ utilized three times as many food  categories as _Procyon cancrivorus_, _Nasua nasua_, and _Bassariscus  astutus_; about two times as many as _Nasua narica_; and nine times as  many as _Potos flavus_. (4) Intrinsic rate of natural increase  correlated positively with [.H]_{b}. _Procyon lotor_ had the highest  r_{max} (2.52 of expected) and _Potos flavus_ the lowest (0.48 of  expected). The other procyonids examined also had low [.H]_{b}, but  their r_{max}'s were higher than predicted (1.11-1.32 of expected).  Early age of first female reproduction, fairly large litter size, long  life span, high-quality diet, and, in one case, female social  organization all compensated for low [.H]_{b} and elevated r_{max}.  (5) Although data on the capacity for evaporative cooling were  incomplete, this variable appeared to be best developed in _Procyon  lotor_ and _Bassariscus astutus_, the two species that have been most  successful at including temperate climates in their distributions.    These five variables are functionally interrelated, and have  co-evolved in each species to form a unique adaptive unit that  regulates body temperature and energy balance throughout each annual  cycle. The first four variables were converted into normalized  dimensionless numbers, which were used to derive a composite score  that represented each species' adaptive unit. _Procyon lotor_ had the  highest composite score (1.47) and _Potos flavus_ the lowest (0.39).  Scores for the other procyonids were intermediate to these extremes  (0.64-0.79). There was a positive correlation between the number of  climates a species occupies and the magnitude of its composite score.  Linear regression of this relationship indicated that 89% of the  variance in climatic distribution was attributed to the composite  scores. Differences in metabolic adaptation, therefore, have played a  role in delimiting climatic distribution of these species.    It was clear that _Procyon lotor_ differed from the other procyonids  with respect to thermoregulatory ability, diet, and reproductive  potential. These differences have enabled it to become a highly  successful climate generalist, and its evolution of an [.H]_{b} that  is higher than the procyonid norm appears to be the cornerstone of its  success.
