H. T. Jackson (1928:101) included the species  _Sorex vagrans_, _S. obscurus_, _S. pacificus_, _S. yaquinae_, and _S.  durangae_. The last mentioned species has been shown (Findley, 1955:617)  to belong to another species group. _Sorex milleri_, also assigned to  this group by Jackson (1947:131), seems to have its affinities with the  _cinereus_ group as will be explained beyond. The position of the  _vagrans_ group in relationship to other members of the genus will be  discussed.    Of this group, the species that was named first was _Sorex vagrans_  Baird, 1858. Subsequently many other names were based on members of  the group and these names were excellently organized by Jackson in his  1928 revision of the genus. Subsequent students of western mammals,  nevertheless, have been puzzled by such problems as the relationship of  (1) _Sorex vagrans monticola_ to _Sorex obscurus obscurus_ in the Rocky  Mountains, (2) _Sorex pacificus_, _S. yaquinae_, and _S. obscurus_ to  one another on the Pacific Coast, and (3) _S. o. obscurus_ to  _S. v. amoenus_ in California. Few studies have been made of these  relationships. Clothier (1950) studied _S. v. monticola_ and _S. o.  obscurus_ in western Montana and concluded that the two supposed kinds  actually were not separable in that area. Durrant (1952:33) was able to  separate the two kinds in Utah as was Hall (1946:119, 122) in Nevada.  Other mammalogists who worked within the range of the _vagrans-obscurus_  groups have avoided the problems in one way or another. Recently Rudd  (1953) has examined the relationships of _S. vagrans_ to _S. ornatus_.          MATERIALS METHODS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS      Approximately 3,465 museum study skins and skulls were studied. Most  of these were assembled at the University of Kansas Museum of Natural  History, but some were examined in other institutions.    Specimens were grouped by geographic origin, age, and sex. Studies of  the role of age and sex in variation were made. Because it was  discovered that secondary sexual variation was negligible, both males  and females, if of like age and pelage, were used in comparisons  designed to reveal geographic variation.    External measurements used were total length, length of tail, and  length of hind foot. After studying a number of cranial dimensions I  chose those listed below as the most useful in showing differences in  size and proportions of the skull. Figures 1 and 2 show the points  between which those measurements were taken.    _Condylobasal length._--From anteriormost projection of the  premaxillae to posteriormost projection of the occipital condyles  (a to a').    _Maxillary tooth-row._--From posteriormost extension of M3 to  anteriormost extension of first unicuspid (b to b').    _Palatal length._--From anteriormost projection of premaxillae to  posteriormost part of bony palate (c to c').    _Cranial breadth._--Greatest lateral diameter of braincase (d to d').    _Least interorbital breadth._--Distance between medialmost superior  edges of orbital fossae, measured between points immediately above and  behind posterior openings of infraorbital foramina (e to e').    _Maxillary breadth._--Distance between lateral tips of maxillary  processes (f to f').       [Illustration: FIGS. 1 AND 2. Showing where certain cranial        measurements were taken. x 3-1/2. (Based on _Sorex vagrans        obscurus_, from Stonehouse Creek, 5-1/2 mi., W junction of        Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, British Columbia,        [Female], 28545 KU.)]    In descriptions of color, capitalized terms refer to those in Ridgway  (1912). In addition the numerical and alphabetical designations of  these terms are given since a knowledge of the arrangements of these  designations enables one quickly to evaluate differences between  stated colors. Color terms which are not capitalized do not refer to  any precise standard of color nomenclature.    In the accounts of subspecies, descriptions, unless otherwise noted,  are of first year animals as herein defined. Descriptions of color are  based on fresh pelages.    Unless otherwise indicated, specimens are in the University of Kansas  Museum of Natural History.

Conner Museum    In nature, the subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_ form a cline and are  distributed geographically in a chain which is bent back upon itself.  The subspecies in the following accounts are listed in order from the  southwestern end of the chain clockwise back to the zone of overlap.    The synonymy of each subspecies includes the earliest available name  and other names in chronological order. These include the first usage  of the name combination employed by me and other name combinations  that have been applied to the subspecies concerned.    In the lists of specimens examined, localities are arranged first by  state or province. These are listed in tiers from north to south and  in any given tier from west to east. Within a given state, localities  are grouped by counties, which are listed in the same geographic  sequence as were the states and provinces (N to S and W to E). Within  a given county, localities are arranged from north to south. If two or  more localities are at the same latitude the westernmost is listed  first. Marginal localities are listed in a separate paragraph at the  end of each account. The northernmost marginal locality is listed  first and the rest follow in clockwise order. Those records followed  by a citation to an authority are of specimens which I have not  personally examined. Marginal records are shown by dots on the range  maps.

At that time the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala had an air strip and camp  at Chinaja, from which place the company was constructing a road  northward through the forest. In mid-February, 1960, J. Knox Jones, Jr.  and I flew into El Peten to collect and study mammals, reptiles, and  amphibians. While enjoying the comforts of the fine field camp at  Chinaja, we worked in the surrounding forest and availed ourselves of  the opportunity to be on hand when the road crews were cutting the tall  trees in the forest, thereby bringing to the ground many interesting  specimens of the arboreal fauna. We stayed at Chinaja until late March,  with the exception of a week spent at Toocog, another camp of the Ohio  Oil Company located 15 kilometers southeast of La Libertad and on the  edge of the savanna. Thus, at Toocog we were able to work both in the  forest and on the savanna. In the summer of 1960, John Wellman  accompanied me to El Peten for two weeks in June and July. Most of our  time was spent at Chinaja, but a few days were spent at Toocog and other  localities in south-central El Peten.    Many areas in Guatemala have been studied intensively by L. C. Stuart,  who has published on the herpetofauna of the forested area of  northeastern El Peten (1958), the savannas of central El Peten (1935),  and the humid mountainous region to the south of El Peten in Alta  Verapaz (1948 and 1950). The area studied by me and my companions is  covered with rainforest and lies to the north of the highlands of Alta  Verapaz and to the south of the savannas of central El Peten. A few  specimens of amphibians and reptiles were obtained in this area in 1935  by C. L. Hubbs and Henry van der Schalie; this collection, reported on  by Stuart (1937), contained only one species, _Cochranella  fleischmanni_, not present in our collection of 77 species and 617  specimens.      Acknowledgments    I am grateful to L. C. Stuart of the University of Michigan, who made  the initial arrangements for our work in El Peten, aided me in the  identification of certain specimens, and helped in the preparation of  this report. J. Knox Jones, Jr. and John Wellman were able field  companions, who added greatly to the number of specimens in the  collection. In Guatemala, Clark M. Shimeall and Harold Hoopman of the  Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala made available to us the facilities of the  company's camps at Chinaja and Toocog. Alberto Alcain and Luis Escaler  welcomed us at Chinaja and gave us every possible assistance. Juan  Monteras and Antonio Aldana made our stay at Toocog enjoyable and  profitable. During our visits to southern El Peten, Julio Bolon C.  worked for us as a collector, and between March and June he collected  and saved many valuable specimens; his knowledge of the forest and its  inhabitants was a great asset to our work. Jorge A. Ibarra, Director of  the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural in Guatemala assisted us in  obtaining necessary permits and extended other kindnesses. To all of  these people I am indebted for the essential parts that they played in  the completion of this study.    Field work in the winter of 1960 was made possible by funds from the  American Heart Association for the purposes of collecting mammalian  hearts. My field work in the summer of 1960 was supported by a grant  from the Graduate Research Fund of the University of Kansas.          DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA      A vast lowland region stretches northward for approximately 700  kilometers from the highlands of Guatemala to the Gulf of Mexico. The  northern two-thirds of this low plain is bordered on three sides by seas  and forms the Yucatan Peninsula. The lowlands at the base of the  Yucatan Peninsula make up the Departamento El Peten of Guatemala. The  area with which this report is concerned consists of the south-central  part of El Peten.      Physiography    Immediately south of Chinaja is a range of hills, the Serrania de  Chinaja, having an almost due east-west axis and a crest of about 600  meters above sea level. South of the Serrania de Chinaja are  succeedingly higher ridges building up to the Meseta de Coban and Sierra  de Pocolha and eventually to the main Guatemalan highlands. The northern  face of the Serrania de Chinaja is a fault scarp dropping abruptly from  about 650 meters at the crest to about 140 meters at the base. From the  base of the Serrania de Chinaja northward to the Rio de la Pasion at  Sayaxche the terrain is gently rolling and has a total relief of about  50 meters. North of the Rio de la Pasion is a low dome reaching an  elevation of 170 meters at La Libertad; see Stuart (1935:12) for further  discussion of the physiography of central El Peten. The rocks in  southern El Peten are predominately Miocene marine limestones; there are  occasional pockets of Pliocene deposits. There is little evidence of  subterranean solution at Chinaja, but northward in central El Peten  karsting is common. The upper few inches of soil is humus rich in  organic matter; below this is clay.      Climate    The climate of El Peten is tropical with equable temperatures throughout  the year. Temperatures at Chinaja varied between a night-time low of 65 deg.  F. and a daytime high of 91 deg. F. during the time of our visits. In the  Koeppen system of classification the climate at Chinaja and Toocog is Af.  Rain falls throughout the year, but there is a noticeable dry season. To  anyone who has traveled from south to north in El Peten and the Yucatan  Peninsula, it is obvious from the changes in vegetation that there is a  decrease in rainfall from south to north. There is a noticeable  difference between Chinaja and Toocog. Although rainfall data are not  available for Chinaja and Toocog, there are records for nearby stations  (Sapper, 1932). At Paso Caballos on the Rio San Pedro about 40  kilometers northwest of Toocog the average annual rainfall amounts to  1620 mm.; the driest month is March (21 mm.), and the wettest months are  June (269 mm.) and September (265 mm.). At Cubilquitz, Alta Verapaz,  about 35 kilometers south-southwest of Chinaja and at an elevation of  300 meters, the average annual rainfall is 4006 mm.; the driest month is  March (128 mm.), and the wettest months are July (488 mm.) and October  (634 mm.).    During the 18 days in February and March, 1960, that we kept records on  the weather at Chinaja moderate to heavy showers occurred on seven days.  During our stay there in June and July rain fell every day, as it did in  Toocog. However, during the week spent at Toocog in March no rain fell.      Vegetation    The vegetation of northern and central El Peten has been studied by  Lundell (1937), who made only passing remarks concerning the plants of  the southern part of El Peten. No floristic studies have been made  there. The following remarks are necessarily brief and are intended  only to give the reader a general picture of the forest. I have included  names of a few of the commoner trees that I recognized.    Chinaja is located in a vast expanse of unbroken rainforest. In this  forest there is a noticeable stratification of the vegetation. Three  strata are apparent; in the uppermost layer the tops of the trees are  from 40 to 50 meters above the ground. The spreading crowns of the trees  and the interlacing vines form a nearly continuous canopy over the lower  layers. Among the common trees in the upper stratum are _Calophyllum  brasiliense_, _Castilla elastica_, _Cedrela mexicana_, _Ceiba  pentandra_, _Didalium guianense_, _Ficus_ sp., _Sideroxylon lundelli_,  _Swietenia macrophylla_, and _Vitex_ sp. (Pl. 1, fig. 1). The middle  layer of trees have crowns about 25 meters above the"]]]
