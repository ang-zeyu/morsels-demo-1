Do you come to gain a dream, or to regain lost  dreams of old; to gild your life with the drowsy gold of romance,  to lose a creeping sorrow, to forget that too many of your hours are  sullen, grey, bereft? What do you wish of Egypt?    The Sphinx will not ask you, will not care. The Pyramids, lifting their  unnumbered stones to the clear and wonderful skies, have held, still  hold, their secrets; but they do not seek for yours. The terrific  temples, the hot, mysterious tombs, odorous of the dead desires of men,  crouching in and under the immeasurable sands, will muck you with their  brooding silence, with their dim and sombre repose. The brown children  of the Nile, the toilers who sing their antique songs by the shadoof and  the sakieh, the dragomans, the smiling goblin merchants, the Bedouins  who lead your camel into the pale recesses of the dunes--these will not  trouble themselves about your deep desires, your perhaps yearning hunger  of the heart and the imagination.    Yet Egypt is not unresponsive.    I came back to her with dread, after fourteen years of absence--years  filled for me with the rumors of her changes. And on the very day of my  arrival she calmly reassured me. She told me in her supremely magical  way that all was well with her. She taught me once more a lesson I had  not quite forgotten, but that I was glad to learn again--the lesson that  Egypt owes her most subtle, most inner beauty to Kheper, although she  owes her marvels to men; that when he created the sun which shines upon  her, he gave her the lustre of her life, and that those who come to her  must be sun-worshippers if they would truly and intimately understand  the treasure or romance that lies heaped within her bosom.    Thoth, says the old legend, travelled in the Boat of the Sun. If you  would love Egypt rightly, you, too, must be a traveller in that bark.  You must not fear to steep yourself in the mystery of gold, in the  mystery of heat, in the mystery of silence that seems softly showered  out of the sun. The sacred white lotus must be your emblem, and Horus,  the hawk-headed, merged in Ra, your special deity. Scarcely had I set  foot once more in Egypt before Thoth lifted me into the Boat of the sun  and soothed my fears to sleep.    I arrived in Cairo. I saw new and vast hotels; I saw crowded streets;  brilliant shops; English officials driving importantly in victorias,  surely to pay dreadful calls of ceremony; women in gigantic hats, with  Niagaras of veil, waving white gloves as they talked of--I guess--the  latest Cairene scandal. I perceived on the right hand and on the left  waiters created in Switzerland, hall porters made in Germany, Levantine  touts, determined Jews holding false antiquities in their lean fingers,  an English Baptist minister, in a white helmet, drinking chocolate on a  terrace, with a guide-book in one fist, a ticket to visit monuments  in the other. I heard Scottish soldiers playing, \"I'll be in Scotland  before ye!\" and something within me, a lurking hope, I suppose, seemed  to founder and collapse--but only for a moment. It was after four in the  afternoon. Soon day would be declining. And I seemed to remember that  the decline of day in Egypt had moved me long ago--moved me as few, rare  things have ever done. Within half an hour I was alone, far up the  long road--Ismail's road--that leads from the suburbs of Cairo to the  Pyramids. And then Egypt took me like a child by the hand and reassured  me.    It was the first week of November, high Nile had not subsided, and all  the land here, between the river and the sand where the Sphinx keeps  watch, was hidden beneath the vast and tranquil waters of what seemed a  tideless sea--a sea fringed with dense masses of date-palms, girdled in  the far distance by palm-trees that kept the white and the brown houses  in their feathery embrace. Above these isolated houses pigeons circled.  In the distance the lateen sails of boats glided, sometimes behind the  palms, coming into view, vanishing and mysteriously reappearing among  their narrow trunks. Here and there a living thing moved slowly, wading  homeward through this sea: a camel from the sands of Ghizeh, a buffalo,  two donkeys, followed by boys who held with brown hands their dark blue  skirts near their faces, a Bedouin leaning forward upon the neck of his  quickly stepping horse. At one moment I seemed to look upon the lagoons  of Venice, a watery vision full of a glassy calm. Then the palm-trees in  the water, and growing to its edge, the pale sands that, far as the  eyes could see, from Ghizeh to Sakkara and beyond, fringed it toward  the west, made me think of the Pacific, of palmy islands, of a paradise  where men grow drowsy in well-being, and dream away the years. And  then I looked farther, beyond the pallid line of the sands, and I saw  a Pyramid of gold, the wonder Khufu had built. As a golden wonder it  saluted me after all my years of absence. Later I was to see it grey as  grey sands, sulphur color in the afternoon from very near at hand, black  as a monument draped in funereal velvet for a mourning under the stars  at night, white as a monstrous marble tomb soon after dawn from the  sand-dunes between it and Sakkara. But as a golden thing it greeted me,  as a golden miracle I shall remember it.    Slowly the sun went down. The second Pyramid seemed also made of gold.  Drowsily splendid it and its greater brother looked set on the golden  sands beneath the golden sky. And now the gold came traveling down from  the desert to the water, turning it surely to a wine like the wine of  gold that flowed down Midas's throat; then, as the magic grew, to a  Pactolus, and at last to a great surface that resembled golden ice,  hard, glittering, unbroken by any ruffling wave. The islands rising from  this golden ice were jet black, the houses black, the palms and their  shadows that fell upon the marvel black. Black were the birds that flew  low from roof to roof, black the wading camels, black the meeting leaves  of the tall lebbek-trees that formed a tunnel from where I stood to Mena  House. And presently a huge black Pyramid lay supine on the gold, and  near it a shadowy brother seemed more humble than it, but scarcely less  mysterious. The gold deepened, glowed more fiercely. In the sky above  the Pyramids hung tiny cloud wreaths of rose red, delicate and airy as  the gossamers of Tunis. As I turned, far off in Cairo I saw the first  lights glittering across the fields of doura, silvery white, like  diamonds. But the silver did not call me. My imagination was held  captive by the gold. I was summoned by the gold, and I went on, under  the black lebbek-trees, on Ismail's road, toward it. And I dwelt in it  many days.    The wonders of Egypt man has made seem to increase in stature before the  spirits' eyes as man learns to know them better, to tower up ever higher  till the imagination is almost stricken by their looming greatness.  Climb the great Pyramid, spend a day with Abou on its summit, come down,  penetrate into its recesses, stand in the king's chamber, listen to the  silence there, feel it with your hands--is it not tangible in this hot  fastness of incorruptible death?--creep, like the surreptitious midget  you feel yourself to be, up those long and steep inclines of polished  stone, watching the gloomy darkness of the narrow walls, the far-off  pinpoint of light borne by the Bedouin who guides you, hear the twitter  of the bats that have their dwelling in this monstrous gloom that man  has made to shelter the thing whose ambition could never be embalmed,  though that, of all qualities, should have been given here, in the land  it dowered, a life perpetual. Now you know the Great Pyramid. You know  that you can climb it, that you can enter it. You have seen it from all  sides, under all aspects. It is familiar to you.    No, it can never be that. With its more wonderful comrade, the Sphinx,  it has the power peculiar, so it seems to me, to certain of the rock and  stone monuments of Egypt, of holding itself ever aloof, almost like the  soul of man which can retreat at will, like the Bedouin retreating from  you into the blackness of the Pyramid, far up, or far down, where the  pursuing stranger, unaided, cannot follow.          II    THE SPHINX    One day at sunset I saw a bird trying to play with the Sphinx--a bird  like a swallow, but with a ruddy brown on its breast, a gleam of blue  somewhere on its wings. When I came to the edge of the sand basin where  perhaps Khufu saw it lying nearly four thousand years before the birth  of Christ, the Sphinx and the bird were quite alone. The bird flew near  the Sphinx, whimsically turning this way and that, flying now low, now  high, but ever returning to the magnet which drew it, which held it,  from which it surely longed to extract some sign of recognition. It  twittered, it posed itself in the golden air, with its bright eyes  fixed upon those eyes of stone which gazed beyond it, beyond the land of  Egypt, beyond the world of men, beyond the centre of the sun to the last  verges of eternity. And presently it alighted on the head of the Sphinx,  then on its ear, then on its breast; and over the breast it tripped  jerkily, with tiny, elastic steps, looking upward, its whole body  quivering apparently with a desire for comprehension--a desire for some  manifestation of friendship.

If all the methods as given in this book had been studied out by one  man and he began trapping when Columbus discovered America, more than  four hundred years ago, he would not be half completed.    The methods given on the following pages are principally taken from  articles published in the H-T-T, and as the writers give their own  most successful methods, the trapper of little experience with fox  will find them of great value.    Their articles are from all parts of America, so that trappers from  any section will find a method or methods that can be used. The red  fox is the one most sets describe, yet what is a good method for one  species is apt to be for others.    A. R. HARDING.        FOX TRAPPING        CHAPTER I.    GENERAL INFORMATION.    Foxes are found in all parts of America, but probably most numerous  in the New England States and parts of Canada. The range of the red  is from Virginia to Alaska; grey, Southern and Southwestern States;  cross, Northern New Jersey to Manitoba; black, Alaska, and the  territories several hundred miles to the South and East; swift, the  prairies or Great Plains; white and blue, the Arctic Regions.    While their fur has been one of value for many, many years, and they  have been hunted, trapped and snared, yet their numbers are holding  up remarkably well owing to their shrewdness. While many tricks are  claimed for foxes that they never did, yet they are very cunning  animals and also fleet on foot.    In hilly and mountainous countries they travel much on the highest  ground, and have regular \"crossings,\" where the experienced hunter or  trapper often makes a kill or catch.    Foxes are carnivorous--living on flesh. Their principal food consists  of rabbits, squirrels, mice, birds, bugs, eggs, etc. In some places  where the food named is not plenty they visit creeks, lakes and ponds  hunting crabs and fish. While they prefer fresh meat, they take stale  and even decayed meats in severe weather.    Most wild animals can be attracted a short distance by \"scent\" or  \"decoy,\" and the fox is one of them. Several good recipts for scent  are given, but if there are no foxes in your neighborhood you can use  all the \"scents\" and \"decoys\" you wish on a hundred traps all season  without making a catch. There is no \"decoy\" that will attract a fox a  mile, but there are some that are good. That many of the writers made  good catches is bourn out by the various photographs, and in some  instances by personal visits by the author to the trapper.    Foxes should not be trapped or shot until cold weather. In the states  bordering on Canada about November 1st, while to the north they  become prime sooner, while to the south they do not become prime  until later.    The pelt should be cased, that is skinned without ripping, and drawn  upon a board. Several tacks or small nails can be used to hold the  skin in place. Leave on the board only two to five days, according to  the weather. When removed, turn fur side out. In drying, keep in a  cool shady place and free from smoke. The number caught and killed  annually is not known, but of the various kinds--red, grey, cross,  white, etc.--it is several hundred thousand.      [Illustration: ALMOST DRY ENOUGH TO TURN.]    The following letters cover trapping and snaring pretty thoroughly,  and all who read carefully and set their traps according to  directions (if there are any foxes) will probably be successful.  While the No. 2 Newhouse, which is a double spring, is known as the  fox trap, the No. 1 1/2 single spring will hold the animal. We have  known of several instances where fine \"reds\" were caught in a No. 1  trap. In those instances, however, the trap was fastened to a loose  brush and every time the fox made a lunge the brush gave. In using  the larger size, we advise using a brush or clog that will give with  every pull or jump of the fox. Traps should be visited every other  day, if possible, but never go only near enough to see that nothing  has been disturbed.    Owing to the wide distribution of the fox and the fact that they  often have crossings near buildings so that their tracks are seen,  etc., makes many inexperienced trappers think the number of animals  larger than it really is. The fact that foxes travel during the  coldest weather as well as any other time, gives the trapper an  opportunity to show his skill when such animals as bear, coon, skunk,  opossum and muskrat are \"denned up.\" Fox skins at such times are at  their best.    As mentioned elsewhere, the greater per cent of the methods published  in this book are taken from the Hunter-Trader-Trapper, an illustrated  monthly magazine, of Columbus, Ohio, devoted to Hunting, trapping and  raw furs. New trapping methods are constantly being published in that  magazine, as experienced trappers from all parts of North America  read and write for it.        CHAPTER II.    BAITS AND SCENTS.    I prefer cat or muskrat for bait, says G. W. Asha. Cut it in pieces  as large as an egg, place it in a perfectly clean can, zinc, screw  cover, place it in the sun, allowing the bait to taint. This must be  done in July or August, or can be done about two weeks before using.  In regard to using scents, many don't believe scent is a help to  trappers, but I'm one that believes in scent, because if there's a  heavy rain storm it takes the scent from the bait. If a little scent  is added, your bait is fresh again. Even heavy frosts have the same  effect in this case. You have seen advertisements saying that scents  will call an animal a mile. Don't take any stock in it, because any  animal can't smell at the most only a few hundred feet away if the  wind is right, not half as far if the wind is not right.    If any of you are beginners trapping fox, scent is a great help, if  you happen to tuck anything around the trap that have effect, if a  little scent is added. A fox can smell only one thing at a time. If  the scent is stronger than human scent, they will not smell the human  scent. Too many accidents in this way have their effect because the  fox is a forest animal in existence. I use for fall trapping the fox  pure skunk glands and pure strained honey (not sugar fed honey) but  clover or flower honey. Winter scent, pure matrix from the female fox  taken in the running season during the heat, a little muskrat musk  and pure strained honey. This scent attracts the male fox and is the  strongest scent in existence.      [Illustration: VERMONT HUNTER AND FOX SKINS.]    Here is a first class fox decoy which can be made very easily, write  Irving Brown, of Vermont. Take one half pint of skunk oil and the  musk glands of a muskrat and one scent bag of a skunk, and you have  the celebrated scent of Schofield, one of the first water set fox  trappers in the East. This should be made in spring, but it is all  right made at any time. It is not the best scent, however, but it is  a most excellent one.    Here is the secret of the best and it is hard to prepare because you  cannot get the female fox in the running season, which is February or  March, in this climate very easily. Take the matrix of a female fox  taken in the running season or, in other words, cut out the entire  sexual organs and place them in a pint of alcohol, and the result  will be the best scent ever made. Some do not use alcohol but salt  the matrix. This is the scent you will buy the secret for $5.00, and  you will be told that foxes are just crazy to get it. This is in a  measure true, but a red fox will not step into a trap unless you use  care in setting it, with any kind of scent. I don't care how frantic  a fox is to get at the bait. They don't commit suicide if they know  it.    There are many other ways to prepare for both mink and fox, all of  them possessing merit, but my aim is to give the best, not those  which are no use to the trapper. The more simple, as a rule, are the  best. Some trappers are"]]]
