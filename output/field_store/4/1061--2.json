Some of these groups,  such as _Plectrohyla_ and _Ptychohyla_, have been elevated to generic  rank, whereas others are retained in the large and complex genus  _Hyla_. In the mountains of Mexico five species of hylids that seem to  compose a phyletic unit are herein referred to as the _Hyla bistincta_  group. Since 1955 I have been accumulating specimens of, and data on,  this group with the result that all specimens known to me, including  the types of all named taxa, have been studied. Detailed observations  have been made on the ecology and life histories of three of the  species; the other two species are known to me only from preserved  specimens.      Acknowledgments    For permission to examine specimens in their care I am indebted to  Charles M. Bogert, American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); Doris  M. Cochran, United States National Museum (USNM); Jean Guibe, Museum  National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris (MNHN); Robert F. Inger, Chicago  Natural History Museum (CNHM); Hobart M. Smith, University of Illinois  Museum of Natural History (UIMNH); Charles F. Walker, University of  Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ).

For their willing assistance in the field I am grateful to Ann S.  Duellman, Dale L. Hoyt, and John Wellman. Permits for collecting in  Mexico were generously issued by the late Ing. Luis Macias Arellano,  Departamento de la Fauna Silvestre, Direccion General de Caza. The  drawings in figures 1 and 3 were executed by Gail Selfridge. This  research has been supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF  G-9827).          THE HYLA BISTINCTA GROUP      The five species comprising the _Hyla bistincta_ group are  moderate-sized hylids having rather blunt heads and robust bodies.  The fingers are long and have little webbing (Fig. 1). The skin of  the dorsum is thick and glandular, but not tuberculate. An anal  sheath is present. The skull is rather broad, flat, and solidly  roofed. The ethmoid is broad, curved downward laterally, and solidly  sutured to the frontoparietal. The nasals are broad, sutured for their  entire width with the ethmoid, and broadly in contact medially. The  premaxillaries are in contact medially; each has a long, flat nasal  process. The quadratojugal is absent, and the maxillary tapers to a  point posteriorly. There is no squamosal-maxillary connection.  The maxillary and premaxillary teeth are rather long, bifid, and  moderately spatulate. Some teeth on the premaxillary and anterior  part of the maxillary are hooked. The vomerine teeth are spatulate  and bifid. A broad, flat, ossified prepollex is present but does  not project as a spine. The known tadpoles have ventral mouths,  2/3 tooth-rows, two or more rows of labial papillae, and long tails  with low fins.        [Illustration: FIG. 1. Palmar view of right hand of:      _a._--_Hyla robertsorum_ (KU 57661),      _b._--_Hyla charadricola_ (KU 58414). x 3.]    As thus defined the _Hyla bistincta_ group can be distinguished from  all other groups of Middle American frogs by the combination of  absence of the quadratojugal, non-projecting prepollex, long fingers  with little webbing, and stream-inhabiting tadpoles having 2/3 tooth  rows and two or more rows of labial papillae.    Possibly _Hyla arborescandens_ and _Hyla hazelae_ belong in this  group. Because these species are somewhat different from the included  species and because their tadpoles are as yet unknown, I have  refrained from including these two species in the _Hyla bistincta_  group. Taylor (1948:261) assigned _Hyla proboscidea_ (= _H.  dalquesti_) and (1949:272) _Hyla cyclomaculata_ to this group, but  because these two species have a quadratojugal and notably different  tadpoles, they are excluded from the group.    Frogs of the genus _Plectrohyla_ closely resemble species in the _Hyla  bistincta_ group but differ principally in having a projecting  prepollex. In the highlands of Costa Rica a group of species, of which  _Hyla moesta_ is best known, resembles species in the _Hyla bistincta_  group. At present insufficient information is available on the Costa  Rican species to determine their affinities.      Analysis of Characters    The characters used in the systematic study of the frogs in this group  are those usually employed in anuran systematics. Of the various  measurements and proportions, the snout-vent length and the relative  size of the tympanum to the eye apparently are of more taxonomic  importance than the others (Table 1). In all of the species the  tympanum is at least partially covered by a heavy, dermal  supratympanic fold, and in some specimens of _H. pachyderma_ the  tympanum is completely obscured. In two species (_H. bistincta_ and  _H. charadricola_) the snout is square, whereas in the other species  it is round.    The fingers are long and slender in _H. crassa_, _pachyderma_, and  _robertsorum_ and somewhat shorter with more webbing in _H. bistincta_  and _charadricola_. Breeding males of _Hyla pachyderma_ have  moderately large nuptial spines; the other species have small spines,  except _H. charadricola_ in which spines apparently are absent. A  well-defined thoracic fold is present in _H. pachyderma_, and a weak  fold is present in _H. robertsorum_; the other species lack folds. In  all species there is an anal sheath; this sheath is longest in _H.  bistincta_, in which the anal opening is directed ventrally at the  level of the lower edge of the thighs.

The dorsal color  varies from dull green to various shades of brown. The most distinct  aspect of the coloration is the different color patterns on the flanks  and posterior surfaces of the thighs. The flanks in all species are  marked with spots or reticulations.    _Hyla bistincta_ differs from other members of the group in having  vocal slits and a distensible vocal sac. Only this species has been  reported to call (Shannon, 1951:473). Insofar as is known, the other  species are mute.

Behind him screamed the hordes of Ciaran,  hungering for that magic jewel--ahead lay the dread abode of the Ice  Creatures--at his side stalked the whispering spectre of Ban Cruach,  urging him on to a battle Stark knew he must lose!_]          I      Through all the long cold hours of the Norland night the Martian had not  moved nor spoken. At dusk of the day before Eric John Stark had brought  him into the ruined tower and laid him down, wrapped in blankets, on the  snow. He had built a fire of dead brush, and since then the two men had  waited, alone in the vast wasteland that girdles the polar cap of Mars.    Now, just before dawn, Camar the Martian spoke.    \"Stark.\"    \"Yes?\"    \"I am dying.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I will not reach Kushat.\"    \"No.\"    Camar nodded. He was silent again.    The wind howled down from the northern ice, and the broken walls rose up  against it, brooding, gigantic, roofless now but so huge and sprawling  that they seemed less like walls than cliffs of ebon stone. Stark would  not have gone near them but for Camar. They were wrong, somehow, with a  taint of forgotten evil still about them.    The big Earthman glanced at Camar, and his face was sad. \"A man likes to  die in his own place,\" he said abruptly. \"I am sorry.\"    \"The Lord of Silence is a great personage,\" Camar answered. \"He does not  mind the meeting place. No. It was not for that I came back into the  Norlands.\"    He was shaken by an agony that was not of the body. \"And I shall not  reach Kushat!\"    Stark spoke quietly, using the courtly High Martian almost as fluently  as Camar.    \"I have known that there was a burden heavier than death upon my  brother's soul.\"    He leaned over, placing one large hand on the Martian's shoulder. \"My  brother has given his life for mine. Therefore, I will take his burden  upon myself, if I can.\"    He did not want Camar's burden, whatever it might be. But the Martian  had fought beside him through a long guerilla campaign among the harried  tribes of the nearer moon. He was a good man of his hands, and in the  end had taken the bullet that was meant for Stark, knowing quite well  what he was doing. They were friends.    That was why Stark had brought Camar into the bleak north country,  trying to reach the city of his birth. The Martian was driven by some  secret demon. He was afraid to die before he reached Kushat.    And now he had no choice.    \"I have sinned, Stark. I have stolen a holy thing. You're an outlander,  you would not know of Ban Cruach, and the talisman that he left when he  went away forever beyond the Gates of Death.\"    Camar flung aside the blankets and sat up, his voice gaining a febrile  strength.    \"I was born and bred in the Thieves' Quarter under the Wall. I was proud  of my skill. And the talisman was a challenge. It was a treasured  thing--so treasured that hardly a man has touched it since the days of  Ban Cruach who made it. And that was in the days when men still had the  lustre on them, before they forgot that they were gods.    \"'Guard well the Gates of Death,' he said, 'that is the city's trust.  And keep the talisman always, for the day may come when you will need  its strength. Who holds Kushat holds Mars--and the talisman will keep  the city safe.'    \"I was a thief, and proud. And I stole the talisman.\"    His hands went to his girdle, a belt of worn leather with a boss of  battered steel. But his fingers were already numb.    \"Take it, Stark. Open the boss--there, on the side, where the beast's  head is carved....\"           *       *       *       *       *    Stark took the belt from Camar and found the hidden spring. The rounded  top of the boss came free. Inside it was something wrapped in a scrap of  silk.    \"I had to leave Kushat,\" Camar whispered. \"I could never go back. But it  was enough--to have taken that.\"    He watched, shaken between awe and pride and remorse, as Stark unwrapped  the bit of silk.    Stark had discounted most of Camar's talk as superstition, but even so  he had expected something more spectacular than the object he held in  his palm.    It was a lens, some four inches across--man-made, and made with great  skill, but still only a bit of crystal. Turning it about, Stark saw that  it was not a simple lens, but an intricate interlocking of many facets.  Incredibly complicated, hypnotic if one looked at it too long.    \"What is its use?\" he asked of Camar.    \"We are as children. We have forgotten. But there is a legend, a  belief--that Ban Cruach himself made the talisman as a sign that he  would not forget us, and would come back when Kushat is threatened. Back  through the Gates of Death, to teach us again the power that was his!\"    \"I do not understand,\" said Stark. \"What are the Gates of Death?\"    Camar answered, \"It is a pass that opens into the black mountains beyond  Kushat. The city stands guard before it--why, no man remembers, except  that it is a great trust.\"    His gaze feasted on the talisman.    Stark said, \"You wish me to take this to Kushat?\"    \"Yes. Yes! And yet....\" Camar looked at Stark, his eyes filling suddenly  with tears. \"No. The North is not used to strangers. With me, you might  have been safe. But alone.... No, Stark. You have risked too much  already. Go back, out of the Norlands, while you can.\"    He lay back on the blankets. Stark saw that a bluish pallor had come  into the hollows of his cheeks.    \"Camar,\" he said. And again, \"Camar!\"    \"Yes?\"    \"Go in peace, Camar. I will take the talisman to Kushat.\"    The Martian sighed, and smiled, and Stark was glad that he had made the  promise.    \"The riders of Mekh are wolves,\" said Camar suddenly. \"They hunt these  gorges. Look out for them.\"    \"I will.\"    Stark's knowledge of the geography of this part of Mars was vague  indeed, but he knew that the mountain valleys of Mekh lay ahead and to  the north, between him and Kushat. Camar had told him of these upland  warriors. He was willing to heed the warning.    Camar had done with talking. Stark knew that he had not long to wait.  The wind spoke with the voice of a great organ. The moons had set and it  was very dark outside the tower, except for the white glimmering of the  snow. Stark looked up at the brooding walls, and shivered. There was a  smell of death already in the air.    To keep from thinking, he bent closer to the fire, studying the lens.  There were scratches on the bezel, as though it had been held sometime  in a clamp, or setting, like a jewel. An ornament, probably, worn as a  badge of rank. Strange ornament for a barbarian king, in the dawn of  Mars. The firelight made tiny dancing sparks in the endless inner  facets. Quite suddenly, he had a curious feeling that the thing was  alive.    A pang of primitive and unreasoning fear shot through him, and he fought  it down. His vision was beginning to blur, and he shut his eyes, and in  the darkness it seemed to him that he could see and hear....           *       *       *       *       *    He started up, shaken now with an eerie terror, and raised his hand to  hurl the talisman away. But the part of him that had learned with much  pain and effort to be civilized made him stop, and think.    He sat down again. An instrument of hypnosis? Possibly. And yet that  fleeting touch of sight and sound had not been his own, out of his own  memories.    He was tempted now, fascinated, like a child that plays with fire. The  talisman had been worn somehow. Where? On the breast? On the brow?    He tried the first, with no result. Then he touched the flat surface of  the lens to his forehead.    _The great tower of stone rose up monstrous to the sky. It was whole,  and there were pallid lights within that stirred and flickered, and it  was crowned with a shimmering darkness._    He lay outside the tower, on his belly, and he was filled with fear and  a great anger, and a loathing such as turns the bones to water. There  was no snow. There was ice everywhere, rising to half the tower's  height, sheathing the ground.    Ice. Cold and clear and beautiful--and deadly.    He moved. He glided snakelike, with infinite caution, over the smooth  surface. The tower was gone, and far below him was a city. He saw the  temples and the palaces, the glittering lovely city beneath him in the  ice, blurred and fairylike and strange, a dream half glimpsed through  crystal.    He saw the Ones that lived there, moving slowly through the streets. He  could not see them clearly, only the vague shining of their bodies, and  he was glad.    He hated them, with a hatred that conquered even his fear, which was  great indeed.    He was not Eric John Stark. He was Ban Cruach.    The tower and the city vanished, swept away on a reeling tide.    He stood beneath a scarp of black rock, notched with a single pass. The  cliffs hung over him, leaning out their vast bulk as though to crush  him, and the narrow mouth of the pass was full of evil laughter where  the wind went by.    He began to walk forward, into the pass. He was quite alone.    The light was dim and strange at the bottom of that cleft. Little veils  of mist crept and clung between the ice and the rock, thickened, became  more dense as he went farther and farther into the pass. He could not  see, and the wind spoke with many tongues, piping in the crevices of the  cliffs.    All at once there was a shadow in the mist before him, a dim gigantic  shape that moved toward him, and he knew that he looked at death. He  cried out....    It was Stark who yelled in blind atavistic"]]]
