WASHINGTON, D.C. 1966          _Publications of the United States National Museum_      The scholarly and scientific publications of the United States National  Museum include two series, _Proceedings of the United States National  Museum_ and _United States National Museum Bulletin_.    In these series, the Museum publishes original articles and monographs  dealing with the collections and work of its constituent museums--The  Museum of Natural History and the Museum of History and  Technology--setting forth newly acquired facts in the fields of  anthropology, biology, history, geology, and technology. Copies of each  publication are distributed to libraries, to cultural and scientific  organizations, and to specialists and others interested in the different  subjects.    The _Proceedings_, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in  separate form, of shorter papers from the Museum of Natural History.  These are gathered in volumes, octavo in size, with the publication date  of each paper recorded in the table of contents of the volume.    In the _Bulletin_ series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appear  longer, separate publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in  several parts) and volumes in which are collected works on related  subjects. _Bulletins_ are either octavo or quarto in size, depending on  the needs of the presentation. Since 1902 papers relating to the  botanical collections of the Museum of Natural History have been  published in the _Bulletin_ series under the heading _Contributions from  the United States National Herbarium_, and since 1959, in _Bulletins_  titled \"Contributions from the Museum of History and Technology,\" have  been gathered shorter papers relating to the collections and research of  that Museum.    The present collection of Contributions, Papers 34-44, comprises  Bulletin 240. Each of these papers has been previously published in  separate form. The year of publication is shown on the last page of each  paper.    FRANK A.

During the intervening three centuries       numerous other chemical miracles have been found, yet       phosphorus retains a special aura of universal importance in       chemistry. Many investigators have occupied themselves with       this element and its diverse chemical compounds. Further       enlightenment and insight into the ways of nature can be       expected from these efforts._         _Not only is the story of phosphorus a major drama in the       history of chemistry; it also illustrates, in a spectacular       example, the growth of this science through the discovery of       connections between apparently unrelated phenomena, and the       continuous interplay between basic science and the search for       practical usage._         THE AUTHOR: _Eduard Farber is a research professor at American       University, Washington, D.C., and has been associated with the       Smithsonian Institution as a consultant in chemistry._      When phosphorus was discovered, nearly three centuries ago, it was  considered a miraculous thing. The only event that provoked a similar  emotion was the discovery of radium more than two centuries later. The  excitement about the _Phosphorus igneus_, Boyle's _Icy Noctiluca_, was  slowly replaced by, or converted into, chemical research. Yet, if we  would allow room for emotion in research, we could still be excited  about the wondrous substance that chemical and biological work continues  to reveal as vitally important. It is a fundamental plant nutrient, an  essential part in nerve and brain substance, a decisive factor in muscle  action and cell growth, and also a component in fast-acting, powerful  poisons. The importance of phosphorus was gradually recognized and the  means by which this took place are characteristic and similar to other  developments in the history of science. This paper was written in order  to summarize these various means which led to the highly complex ways of  present research.          The Element from Animals and Plants      It was a little late to search for the philosophers' stone in 1669, yet  it was in such a search that phosphorus was discovered. Wilhelm Homberg  (1652-1715) described it in the following manner: Brand, \"a man little  known, of low birth, with a bizarre and mysterious nature in all he  did, found this luminous matter while searching for something else. He  was a glassmaker by profession, but he had abandoned it in order to be  free for the pursuit of the philosophical stone with which he was  engrossed. Having put it into his mind that the secret of the  philosophical stone consisted in the preparation of urine, this man  worked in all kinds of manners and for a very long time without finding  anything. Finally, in the year 1669, after a strong distillation of  urine, he found in the recipient a luminant matter that has since been  called phosphorus. He showed it to some of his friends, among them  Mister Kunkel [sic].\"[1]    Neither the name nor the phenomenon were really new. Organic  phosphorescent materials were known to Aristotle, and a lithophosphorus  was the subject of a book published in 1640, based on a discovery made  by a shoemaker, Vicenzo Casciarolo, on a mountain-side near Bologna in  1630.[2] Was the substance new which Brand showed to his friends? Johann  Gottfried Leonhardi quotes a book of 1689 in which the author, Kletwich,  claims that this phosphorus had already been known to Fernelius, the  court physician of King Henri II of France (1154-1189).[3] To the same  period belongs the \"Ordinatio Alchid Bechil Saraceni philosophi,\" in  which Ferdinand Hoefer found a distillation of urine with clay and  carbonaceous material described, and the resulting product named  escarbuncle.[4] It would be worth looking for this source; although  Bechil would still remain an entirely unsuccessful predecessor, it does  seem strange that in all the distillations of arbitrary mixtures, the  conditions should never before 1669 have been right for the formation  and the observation of phosphorus.    [Illustration: Figure 1.--THE ALCHEMIST DISCOVERS PHOSPHORUS. A painting  by Joseph Wright (1734-1779) of Derby, England.]    For Brand's contemporaries at least, the discovery was new and exciting.  The philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716) considered it  important enough to devote some of his time (between his work as  librarian in Hanover and Wolfenbuettel, his efforts to reunite the  Protestant and the Catholic churches, and his duties as Privy Councellor  in what we would call a Department of Justice) to a history of  phosphorus. This friend of Huygens and Boyle tried to prove that Kunckel  was not justified in claiming the discovery for himself.[5] Since then,  it has been shown that Johann Kunckel (1630-1703) actually worked out  the method which neither Brand nor his friend Kraft wanted to disclose.  Boyle also developed a method independently, published it, and  instructed Gottfried Hankwitz in the technique. Later on, Jean Hellot  (1685-1765) gave a meticulous description of the details and a long  survey of the literature.[6]    [Illustration: Figure 2.--GALLEY-OVEN, 1869. The picture is a cross  section through the front of the oven showing one of the 36 retorts, the  receivers for the distillate, and the space in the upper story used for  evaporating the mixture of acid solution of calcium phosphate and coal.  (According to ANSELME PAYEN, _Precis de Chimie industrielle_, Paris,  1849; reproduced from HUGO FLECK, _Die Fabrikation chemischer Produkte  aus thierischen Abfaellen_, Vieweg, Braunschweig, 1862, page 80 of volume  2, 2nd group, of P. BOLLEY'S _Handbuch der chemischen Technologie_.)]    To obtain phosphorus, a good proportion of coal (regarded as a type of  phlogiston) was added to urine, previously thickened by evaporation and  preferably after putrefaction, and the mixture was heated to the highest  attainable temperature. It was obvious that phlogiston entered into the  composition of the distillation product. The question remained whether  this product was generated _de novo_. In his research of 1743 to 1746,  Andreas Sigismund Marggraf (1709-1782) provided the answer. He found the  new substance in edible plant seeds, and he concluded "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33767"],[0,"Campward Ho!

It is hoped that this little book will help to solve many problems which  arise when planning for and running a camp, particularly a Girl Scout  camp. The material in this manual is supplementary to that in the  official Handbook, \"Scouting for Girls,\" and is intended to be used in  conjunction with it.    The information given is the result of experience gained not only as a  camp Director and a housekeeper, but as a co-worker with hundreds of  Scouts whose needs are very real.

It is much more economical and satisfactory to change an idea than a  building, and it behooves us all to learn the trick as soon as possible.  Start to think in the winter; the fall is even better. Begin at the  beginning and let no step of the way be slighted.    Shall we have a camp, and where shall it be, are the first questions  that come to mind. Of course have it, even though it be for a small  group only, and very simple as to equipment. The benefits derived by  body, mind and soul cannot be over-estimated. The joy of finding and  seeing for the first time the things that can only be found and seen in  the open, living away from stilted civilization, flings open a door  which rarely closes again for any length of time. Most people, and  especially children, are not so far away from nature but that love and  appreciation of it can be easily awakened by its beauty of color, form  and sound, or its prodigality which cannot be rivalled. Then to realize  that all humanity is a part of this great system is to love all living  things, to know they are good, and that it is fear which calls forth  their antagonism, as has been proved time and time again. If such things  as these can be learned by living in the open, have we not sufficient  reason for providing the means to the end? Someone has said that  \"cutting the camp out of the Scout year is like leaving the yeast out of  the bread.\"    [Illustration: BETWEEN WOOD AND FIELD. Arrangement of wall tents with  flys, set up with stakes.]    A well ordered camp is built and run on the same lines as a well ordered  house, as regards fundamentals. Whether it is made to accommodate a  small group or an army, all who gather in it must have certain dominant  needs provided for. They must eat, sleep, work, play, keep themselves  and their surroundings clean, and live the group life. How these needs  are met depends on the individual who makes and executes the plans. One  knows how to make his camp comfortable, practical and hospitable  wherever it is, and regardless of materials used, meeting all of his  daily needs, while another, glorying in simplicity _for a while_, does  without comforts which could easily be obtained. Still another casts off  all law and order, to say nothing of many necessities, during his stay  in the open.    But when planning a camp for girls who are to receive the greatest  benefits from living out of doors, and living together, there is no  reason why their environment should not be made pleasing to the eye, of  benefit mentally, a comfort to the body, and in accord with the best  known laws which govern camping.      Work of the Planning Committee    There are specific responsibilities to be borne by Councils or  Committees who undertake to promote and establish a Girl Scout camp. The  most important of these are first, to secure the money for the initial  cost, and second, to obtain a Director. The subsequent work of the  Committee will be determined almost entirely by the character and  capacity of the Director chosen.    The prime requirement for a Camp Director is that she be able to manage  a camp and the children. This means first of all, a strong reliable  character, with enthusiasm and love and understanding for people, and  particularly for young people. She must also have an understanding of  the Scout program, as well as the aims and purposes of the Scout  organization, for the children in these camps are Scouts. She must have  a practical knowledge of the administration of a large household.    If in addition to these qualities she is capable of organizing and  planning, the Council can feel itself lucky, because their specific work  in regard to the camp is ended, and they can with assurance turn over to  the Director such questions as choice of location, the camp site,  arrangements for transportation, price of board, determining and  selection of equipment, the type of children, and the length of the camp  year.    They must not forget to give the Director not only the responsibility  but the requisite authority to act, and perhaps most important, be  ready to give her financial backing.    [Illustration: THE TENT \"GREEN.\" Conical wall tents accommodating eight  cots.

It may be  necessary therefore, for the Committee to divide the work among its  members, or even to engage a professional buyer, or"]]]
