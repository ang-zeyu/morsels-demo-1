FEBRUARY, 1898. NO. 2.           ================================          GILBERT WHITE AND \"SELBORNE.\"      I suppose that a habit of minute observation of nature is one of the  most difficult things to acquire, as it is one which is less generally  pursued than any other study. In almost all departments of learning and  investigation there have been numberless works published to illustrate  them, and text books would fill the shelves of a large library. Thoreau  in his \"Walden\" has shown an extremely fine and close observation of the  scenes in which his all too short life was passed, but his object does  not seem at any time to have been the study of nature from an essential  love of it, or to add to his own or the world's knowledge. On the  contrary, nature was the one resource which enabled him to exemplify his  notions of independence, which were of such a sturdy and uncompromising  character that Mr. Emerson, who had suffered some inconvenience from his  experience of Thoreau as an inmate of his household, thought him fitter  to meet occasionally in the open air than as a guest at table and  fireside. There is a delicious harmony with nature in all that he has  written, but his descriptions of out-of-door life invite us rather to  indolent musing than to investigation or study. Who after reading Izaak  Walton ever went a-fishing with the vigor and enterprise of Piscator?  Washington Irving allowed his cork to drift with the current and lay  down in the shadow of a spreading oak to dream with the beloved old  author.    In White's \"Natural History of Selborne\" we have a unique book indeed,  but of a far more general interest than its title would indicate. Pliny,  the elder, was the father of natural history but to many of us Gilbert  White is entitled to that honor. To an early edition of the book,  without engravings, and much abridged, as compared with Bohn's,  published in 1851, many owe their first interest in the subject.    Mr. Ireland in his charming little \"Book Lover's Enchiridion,\" tells us  that when a boy he was so delighted with it, that in order to possess a  copy of his own (books were not so cheap as now) he actually copied out  the whole work. In a list of one hundred books, Sir John Lubbock  mentions it as \"an inestimable blessing.\" Edward Jesse, author of  \"Gleanings in Natural History\" attributes his own pursuits as an  out-door naturalist entirely to White's example. Much of the charm of  the book consists in the amiable character of the author, who        \"----lived in solitude, midst trees and flowers,      Life's sunshine mingling with its passing showers;      No storms to startle, and few clouds to shade      The even path his Christian virtues made.\"    Very little is known of him beyond what he has chosen to mention in  his diaries, which were chiefly records of his daily studies and  observations, and in his correspondence, from which the \"history\" is in  fact made up. From these it is evident that his habits were secluded and  that he was strongly attached to the charms of rural life. He says the  greater part of his time was spent in literary occupations, and  especially in the study of nature. He was born July 18, 1720, in the  house in which he died. His father was his first instructor in natural  history, and to his brother Thomas, a fellow of the Royal Society, he  was indebted for many suggestions for his work. It is also to his  brother's influence that we owe the publication of the book, as it  required much persuasion to induce the philosopher to pass through the  ordeal of criticism, \"having a great dread of Reviewers,\" those  incorrigible _betes noires_ of authors. His brother promising himself to  review the work in the \"Gentleman's Magazine,\" White reluctantly  consented to its publication. The following short abstract from the  review will show its quality, as well as suggest a possible answer to  the current question propounded by students of the census.    \"Contemplative persons see with regret the country more and more  deserted every day, as they know that every well-regulated family of  property which quits a village to reside in a town, injures the place  that is forsaken in material circumstances. It is with pleasure,  therefore, we observe that so rational an employment of leisure hours as  the study of nature promises to become popular, since whatever adds to  the number of rural amusements, and consequently counteracts the  allurements of the metropolis is, on this consideration, of national  importance.\"    It is to be feared, however, that many stronger influences than this of  the study of nature will be necessary to keep the young men of the  present day from the great cities. Indeed, modern naturalists  themselves spend the greater part of their lives at the centers of  knowledge and only make temporary sallies into the woods and fields to  gather data. White was a noble pioneer. The very minuteness--almost  painful--of his observation required him to occupy himself for days and  weeks and months with what to the average mind would seem of the  slightest importance. As an example of his patient investigation, his  famous study of the tortoise may be given. It was more than thirty years  old when it came into his possession, and for many years--perhaps  twenty--we find White watching the habits of the interesting old  reptile, until, we may assume, he knew all about him and his species.    There are over three hundred and fifty different species of animals and  birds treated by White, most of them exhaustively; the beech tree, the  elm, and the oak are described and watched from year to year; and the  geology and fossil remains of Selborne district are presented. We have  daily accounts of the weather, information of the first tree in leaf,  the appearance of the first fungi and the plants first in blossom. He  tells us when mosses vegetate, when insects first appear and disappear,  when birds are first seen and when they migrate--and a thousand other  things; all in a style of such simplicity, united with rare scholarship,  that it is well worth the attention and imitation of students of the  English language. White was educated at Oxford. He had frequent  opportunities, 'tis said, of accepting college livings, but his fondness  for his native village made him decline all preferment. To this we owe  \"Selborne\" of which Dr. Beardmore, a distinguished scholar, made the  prophetic remark to a nephew of White's: \"Your uncle has sent into the  world a publication with nothing to attract attention to it but an  advertisement or two in the newspapers; but depend upon it, the time will  come when very few who buy books will be without it.\"    The village was far less attractive than our imaginations would depict  it to have been, and the traveler who would \"view fair Selborne  aright,\" according to a contemporary writer, should humor the caprices  of the English climate and visit it only when its fields and foliage are  clothed in their summer verdure.                              --CHARLES C. MARBLE.          A FRIEND OF BIRDS      It is told of George H. Corliss, the famous engine builder of  Providence, R. I., that when building a foundry at the Corliss works,  some Blue Birds took the opportunity to build in some holes in the  interior framework into which horizontal timbers were to go. The  birds flew in and out--as Blue Birds will--and went on with their  housekeeping, until in the natural course of things the workmen would  have evicted them to put the apertures to their intended use of  receiving timbers. But Mr. Corliss interfered and showed how the  particular aperture the birds were occupying could be left undisturbed  until they were done with it, without any serious delay to the building.  So the pair came and went in the midst of the noise of building and  brought up their little family safely, and after they had flown away,  and not until then, that particular part of the framework was completed.    At another time, Mr. Corliss was working on a contract with the city of  Providence to supply a steam pumping apparatus, power house and all,  at Sockonosset, and the time was short, and there were forfeitures  nominated in the bond for every day beyond a a specified date for its  completion.    The power house was to be upon virgin soil where were rocks and  trees--little trees growing among rocks. In blasting and clearing the  necessary place for the foundations of the building, a Robin's nest was  discovered in a little tree within the space where the upheavals were to  be made. When Mr. Corliss knew this he had the work transferred to the  other side of the square or parallelogram around which the digging and  blasting were to go, saying that it was just as well to do the other  side first.    But it proved that when the workmen had got clear around and back to the  Robin's tree, the young birds were still not quite ready to fly. This  called for a new exercise of an inventor's power of adapting means to a  worthy end. Looking at the little tree with its nest and little birds  high in the branches he bade the men support the tree carefully while it  was sawed through the trunk a little above the ground, and then carry it  in an upright position to a safe distance and stick it into the ground  with proper support.    The Robin family continued to thrive after this novel house-moving and  all flew away together after a few more days.          QUEER DOINGS OF A CRANE.      A writer on \"Animal Helpers and Servers\" gives a remarkable account of a  tame Crane, communicated by Von Seyffert. Von Seyffert had a pair of  tame Cranes which soon lost all fear of man and of domestic animals, and  became strongly attached to the former.

INTRODUCTION    THE Koran admittedly occupies an important position among the great religious  books of the world. Though the youngest of the epoch-making works belonging  to this class of literature, it yields to hardly any in the wonderful effect  which it has produced on large masses of men. It has created an all but new  phase of human thought and a fresh type of character. It first transformed a  number of heterogeneous desert tribes of the Arabian peninsula into a nation  of heroes, and then proceeded to create the vast politico-religious  organisations of the Muhammedan world which are one of the great forces with  which Europe and the East have to reckon to-day.    The secret of the power exercised by the book, of course, lay in the mind  which produced it. It was, in fact, at first not a book, but a strong living  voice, a kind of wild authoritative proclamation, a series of admonitions,  promises, threats, and instructions addressed to turbulent and largely  hostile assemblies of untutored Arabs. As a book it was published after the  prophet's death. In Muhammed's life-time there were only disjointed notes,  speeches, and the retentive memories of those who listened to them. To speak  of the Koran is, therefore, practically the same as speaking of Muhammed, and  in trying to appraise the religious value of the book one is at the same time  attempting to form an opinion of the prophet himself. It would indeed be  difficult to find another case in which there is such a complete identity  between the literary work and the mind of the man who produced it.    That widely different estimates have been formed of Muhammed is well-known.  To Moslems he is, of course, the prophet par excellence, and the Koran is  regarded by the orthodox as nothing less than the eternal utterance of Allah.  The eulogy pronounced by Carlyle on Muhammed in Heroes and Hero Worship will  probably be endorsed by not a few at the present day. The extreme contrary  opinion, which in a fresh form has recently been revived1 by an able writer,  is hardly likely to find much lasting support. The correct view very probably  lies between the two extremes. The relative value of any given system of  religious thought must depend on the amount of truth which it embodies as  well as on the ethical standard which its adherents are bidden to follow.  Another important test is the degree of originality that is to be assigned to  it, for it can manifestly only claim credit for that which is new in it, not  for that which it borrowed from other systems.    With regard to the first-named criterion, there is a growing opinion among  students of religious history that Muhammed may in a real sense be regarded  as a prophet of certain truths, though by no means of truth in the absolute  meaning of the term. The shortcomings of the moral teaching contained in the  Koran are striking enough if judged from the highest ethical standpoint with  which we are acquainted; but a much more favourable view is arrived at if a  comparison is made between the ethics of the Koran and the moral tenets of  Arabian and other forms of heathenism which it supplanted.    The method followed by Muhammed in the promulgation of the Koran also  requires to be treated with discrimination. From the first flash of prophetic  inspiration which is clearly discernible in the earlier portions of the book  he, later on, frequently descended to deliberate invention and artful  rhetoric. He, in fact, accommodated his moral sense to the circumstances in  which the r\\oc\\le he had to play involved him.    On the question of originality there can hardly be two opinions now that the  Koran has been thoroughly compared with the Christian and Jewish traditions  of the time; and it is, besides some original Arabian legends, to those only  that the book stands in any close relationship. The matter is for the most  part borrowed, but the manner is all the prophet's own. This is emphatically  a case in which originality consists not so much in the creation of new  materials of thought as in the manner in which existing traditions of various  kinds are utilised and freshly blended to suit the special exigencies of the  occasion. Biblical reminiscences, Rabbinic legends, Christian traditions  mostly drawn from distorted apocryphal sources, and native heathen stories,  all first pass through the prophet's fervid mind, and thence issue in strange  new forms, tinged with poetry and enthusiasm, and well adapted to enforce his  own view of life and duty, to serve as an encouragement to his faithful  adherents, and to strike terror into the hearts of his opponents.    There is, however, apart from its religious value, a more general view from  which the book should be considered. The Koran enjoys the distinction of  having been the starting-point of a new literary and philosophical movement  which has powerfully affected the finest and most cultivated minds among both  Jews and Christians in the Middle Ages. This general progress of the  Muhammedan world has somehow been arrested, but research has shown that what  European scholars knew of Greek philosophy, of mathematics, astronomy, and  like sciences, for several centuries before the Renaissance, was, roughly  speaking, all derived from Latin treatises ultimately based on Arabic  originals; and it was the Koran which, though indirectly, gave the first  impetus to these studies among the Arabs and their allies. Linguistic  investigations, poetry, and other branches of literature, also made their  appearance soon after or simultaneously with the publication of the Koran;  and the literary movement thus initiated has resulted in some of the finest  products of genius and learning.    The style in which the Koran is written requires some special attention in  this introduction. The literary form is for the most part different from  anything else we know. In its finest passages we indeed seem to hear a voice  akin to that of the ancient Hebrew prophets, but there is much in the book  which Europeans usually regard as faulty. The tendency to repetition which is  an inherent characteristic of the Semitic mind appears here in an exaggerated  form, and there is in addition much in the Koran which strikes us as wild and  fantastic. The most unfavourable criticism ever passed on Muhammed's style  has in fact been penned by the prophet's greatest British admirer, Carlyle  himself; and there are probably many now who find themselves in the same  dilemma with that great writer.    The fault appears, however, to lie partly in our difficulty to appreciate the"]]]
