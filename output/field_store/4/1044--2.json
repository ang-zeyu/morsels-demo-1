THE FOLLOWING IS QUOTED FROM THE  EDITOR'S FOREWORD.      We have come across so much rubbish on this subject that we drifted  into the conclusion that an honest sex essay for young folks would  not be produced by this generation.    Recently there came to this desk a manuscript bearing the title _The  Sex Side of Life_ and the sub-title _An Explanation for Young  People_, written by Mary Ware Dennett. No editor ever confesses that  he reads an article with prejudice, but we will admit that we  expected this MS would be \"returned with thanks.\" It was reasonable  to suppose that a laywoman would not succeed where physicians had  failed. Even after we had read the introduction we were not  convinced, for we have met several books whose texts do not fulfill  the promises made by the preface. But after reading a few pages of  the essay itself, we realized we were listening to the music of a  different drummer. Instead of the familiar notes of fear and  pretense, we were surprised to hear the clarion call of truth.    Mary Ware Dennett's _Sex Side of Life_ is \"on the level.\" In the  pages of the _Medical Review of Reviews_, her essay will reach only  the profession, but we sincerely hope that this splendid contribution  will be reprinted in pamphlet form and distributed by thousands to  the general public. We are tolerably familiar with Anglo-American  writings on sexology, but we know nothing that equals Mrs. Dennett's  brochure. Physicians and social workers are frequently asked: \"What  shall I say to my growing child?\" Mary Ware Dennett, in her rational  sex primer, at last furnishes a satisfactory answer.      V. R.          THE SEX SIDE OF LIFE      INTRODUCTION FOR ELDERS    In reading several dozen books on sex matters for the young with a  view to selecting the best for my own children, I found none that I  was willing to put into their hands, without first guarding them  against what I considered very misleading and harmful impressions,  which they would otherwise be sure to acquire in reading them. That  is the excuse for this article.    It is far more specific than most sex information written for young  people. I believe we owe it to children to be specific if we talk  about the subject at all.    From a careful observation of youthful curiosity and a very vivid  recollection of my own childhood, I have tried to explain frankly the  points about which there is the greatest inquiry. These points are  _not_ frankly or clearly explained in most sex literature. They are  avoided, partly from embarrassment, but more, apparently, because  those who have undertaken to instruct the children are not really  clear in their own minds as to the proper status of the sex relation.    I found that from the physiological point of view, the question was  handled with limitations and reservations. From the point of natural  science it was often handled with sentimentality, the child being led  from a semi-esthetic study of the reproduction of flowers and animals  to the acceptance of a similar idea for human beings. From the moral  point of view it was handled least satisfactorily of all, the child  being given a jumble of conflicting ideas, with no means of  correlating them,--fear of venereal disease, one's duty to suppress  \"animal passion,\" the sacredness of marriage, and so forth. And from  the emotional point of view, the subject was not handled at all.    This one omission seems to me to be the key to the whole situation,  and it is the basis of the radical departure I have made from the  precedents in most sex literature for children.    Concerning all four points of view just mentioned, there are certain  departures from the traditional method that have seemed to me worth  making.    On the physiological side I have given, as far as possible, the  proper terminology for the sex organs and functions. Children have  had to read the expurgated literature which has been specially  prepared for them in poetic or colloquial terms, and then are  needlessly mystified when they hear things called by their real  names.    On the side of natural science, I have emphasized our unlikeness to  the plants and animals rather than our likeness, for while the points  we have in common with the lower orders make an interesting section  in our general education, it is knowing about the vital points in  which we differ that helps us to solve the sexual problems of  maturity; and the child needs that knowledge precisely as he needs  knowledge of everything which will fortify him for wise decisions  when he is grown.    On the moral side, I have tried to avoid confusion and dogmatism in  the following ways: by eliminating fear of venereal disease as an  appeal for strictly limited sex relations, stating candidly that  venereal disease _is_ becoming curable; by barring out all mention of  \"brute\" or \"animal\" passion, terms frequently used in pleas for  chastity and self control, as such talk is an aspersion on the brutes  and has done children much harm in giving them the impression that  there is an essential baseness in the sex relation; by inviting the  inference that marriage is \"sacred\" by virtue of its being a  reflection of human ideality rather than because it is a legalized  institution.    Unquestionably the stress which most writers have laid upon the  beauty of nature's plans for perpetuating the plant and animal  species, and the effort to have the child carry over into human life  some sense of that beauty has come from a most commendable instinct  to protect the child from the natural shock of the revelation of so  much that is unesthetic and revolting in human sex life. The nearness  of the sex organs to the excretory organs, the pain and messiness of  childbirth are elements which certainly need some compensating  antidote to prevent their making too disagreeable and  disproportionate an impress on the child's mind.    The results are doubtless good as far as they go, but they do not go  nearly far enough. What else is there to call upon to help out? Why,  the one thing which has been persistently neglected by practically  all the sex writers,--the emotional side of sex experience. Parents  and teachers have been afraid of it and distrustful of it. In not a  single one of all the books for young people that I have thus far  read has there been the frank, unashamed declaration that the climax  of sex emotion is an unsurpassed joy, something which rightly belongs  to every normal human being, a joy to be proudly and serenely  experienced. Instead there has been all too evident an inference that  sex emotion is a thing to be ashamed of, that yielding to it is  indulgence which must be curbed as much as possible, that all thought  and understanding of it must be rigorously postponed, at any rate  till after marriage.    We give to young folks, in their general education, as much as they  can grasp of science and ethics and art, and yet in their sex  education, which rightly has to do with all of these, we have said,  \"Give them only the bare physiological facts, lest they be  prematurely stimulated.\" Others of us, realizing that the bare  physiological facts are shocking to many a sensitive child, and must  somehow be softened with something pleasant, have said, \"Give them  the facts, yes, but see to it that they are so related to the wonders  of evolution and the beauties of the natural world that the shock is  minimized.\" But none of us has yet dared to say, \"Yes, give them the  facts, give them the nature study, too, but also give them some  conception of sex life as a vivifying joy, as a vital art, as a thing  to be studied and developed with reverence for its big meaning, with  understanding of its far-reaching reactions, psychologically and  spiritually, with temperant restraint, good taste and the highest  idealism.\" We have contented ourselves by assuming that marriage  makes sex relations respectable. We have not yet said that it is only  beautiful sex relations that can make marriage lovely.    Young people are just as capable of being guided and inspired in  their thought about sex emotion as in their taste and ideals in  literature and ethics, and just as they imperatively need to have  their general taste and ideals cultivated as a preparation for mature  life, so do they need to have some understanding of the marvelous  place which sex emotion has in life.    Only such an understanding can be counted on to give them the self  control that is born of knowledge, not fear, the reverence that will  prevent premature or trivial connections, the good taste and finesse  that will make their sex life when they reach maturity a vitalizing  success.      AN EXPLANATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE    When boys and girls get into their \"teens,\" a side of them begins to  wake up which has been asleep or only partly developed ever since  they were born, that is, the sex side of them. It is the most  wonderful and interesting part of growing up. This waking is partly  of the mind, partly of the body and partly of the feelings or  emotions.    You can't help wanting to understand all about it, but somehow you  find yourself a little embarrassed in asking all the questions that  come into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31751"],[0,"What Bird is That?

APPLETON-CENTURY COMPANY            INCORPORATED            NEW YORK  LONDON                    COPYRIGHT, 1920, BY            D. APPLETON & COMPANY              _All rights reserved. This book, or parts            thereof, must not be reproduced in any            form without permission of the publishers._                  PRINTED IN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA          INTRODUCTION      AS Curator of the Department of Birds of the American Museum of Natural  History I have had exceptional facilities for the arrangement of  collections designed to give students a comprehensive view of local  bird-life without confusing them with unnecessary details.    Among other aids to this end a collection of 'Birds Found within 50  Miles of New York' has been placed in a special hall and so grouped that  the visitor who wishes to identify some bird seen within these limits  may do so with the least possible difficulty. In addition to the  'General Systematic Collection,' containing specimens of the 350-odd  species of birds which have been recorded from the New York City region,  there is also a 'Seasonal Collection.' This Seasonal Collection contains  only the birds of the month. Its base is the 'Permanent Resident Birds,'  or those which, like the Crow, are with us throughout the year. To  these, the migratory species are added or subtracted, as they come or  go. The collection of migratory species is therefore revised the first  of each month. Birds which are due to arrive during the month are added,  those which have left us are withdrawn. The Seasonal Collection thus  gives us, at a glance, a picture of the bird-life of the month and  correspondingly limits the field of our inquiry when we go to it to  learn the name of some strange bird recently observed. In January,  therefore, we have not to consider the birds of June, nor need we be  concerned with winter birds in summer. The season of occurrence thus  gives us an important clue to a bird's identity.    For somewhat more than a quarter of a century this small collection has  achieved its object so effectively that I have attempted to embody the  idea it demonstrates in a series of drawings which have been admirably  executed by Mr. Edmund Sawyer. As foundation plates or 'collections,' we  have first two 'cases' of the winter land birds of the Northeastern  States, or from about Maryland northward, containing the Permanent  Residents, which form part of the bird-life of every month of the year,  and the Winter Visitants, or those birds which come from the North in  the fall to remain with us until the following spring.    Cases 3 and 4 contain the Permanent Resident and Winter Visitant land  birds of the Southern States. Whether the student is in the North or in  the South he has, therefore, a 'collection' of the land birds which he  may expect to find during the winter months.    Cases 5 to 8 contain the migrants arranged according to the order of  their arrival from the South in the vicinity of New York City. Since it  is not practicable to have cases containing collections of migrants for  other latitudes, data are given showing what changes in dates should be  made to adapt the schedule presented to other localities, including  Washington, D.C., Ossining, N.Y., Cambridge, Mass., northern Ohio, Glen  Ellyn, near Chicago, and southeastern Minnesota. The records for these  localities are quoted from the author's 'Handbook of Birds of Eastern  North America' to which they were contributed respectively by Dr. C.W.  Richmond, Dr. A.K. Fisher, William Brewster, Lynds Jones, B.T. Gault,  and Dr. Thos. S. Roberts.    With these facts, the cases in a large measure tell their own story,  just as does our Museum Seasonal Collection; but further to assist the  student I have added what may be termed a 'label' for each of the  'specimens' they contain. These labels include comments on each bird's  distinctive characters, a statement of its nesting and winter range, the  notes on its status at various localities, to which I have just  referred, and brief remarks on its habits.    It is the specimens, however, not the labels, which warrant the  publication of this little volume, for I hope that, like their  prototypes in the American Museum, they will be a means of acquainting  us with \"the most eloquent expressions of Nature's beauty, joy and  freedom,\" and thereby add to our lives a resource of incalculable value.    While the birds in the cases are small, they are drawn and reproduced  with such accuracy that no essential detail of color or form is lost.  Above all, they have the rare merit of being all drawn to nearly the  same scale. One will soon learn therefore to measure the proportions of  unknown birds by comparison with those with which one is familiar, and  since relative size is the most obvious character in naming birds in  nature, this is a feature of the first importance.    The student is strongly urged _first_, to become thoroughly familiar  with the 'map' of a bird given in the frontispiece: _second_, to use an  opera- or field-glass when observing birds: _third_, to write  descriptions of unknown birds _while they are in view_ stating their  length, shape, and as many details of their color and markings as can be  seen: _fourth_, to remember that one is not likely to find birds except  in their regular seasons: and, _fifth_, to take this book afield with  him and make direct comparison of the living bird with its colored  figure. The wide margins are designed for use in recording field-notes.              FRANK M. CHAPMAN.              American Museum of Natural History.            New York City.

The Song Sparrow sings \"Spring, spring, spring,  sunny days are here\"; the Meadowlark blows his fife, the Downy rattles  his drum, and company after company of Grackles in glistening black  coats, and of Red-wings with scarlet epaulets, go trooping by. For the  succeeding three months, in orderly array, the feathered army files by,  each member of it at his appointed time whether he comes from the  adjoining State or from below the equator.    Besides the Blackbirds, March brings the Robin and Bluebird, Woodcock,  Phoebe, Meadowlark, Cowbird, Kingfisher, Mourning Dove, Fox, Swamp,  White-throated and Field Sparrows.    Near New York City the New Year of the birds has now passed its infancy  and in April each day adds perceptibly to its strength. 'Pussy' willows  \"creep out along each bough,\" skunk cabbage rears its head in low, wet  woods, and in sun-warmed places early wild flowers peep from beneath the  sodden leaves. With swelling ranks the migratory army moves more  steadily northward. Species which arrived late in March become more  numerous, and to them are soon added the Vesper, Savannah, and Chipping  Sparrows, and other seed-eaters; and when, with increasing warmth,  insects appear, the pioneer Phoebe is followed by other insect-eating  birds, like the Swallows, Pipit, Hermit Thrush, Myrtle and Palm  Warblers, Louisiana Water-thrush and Ruby-crowned Kinglet.    The true bird student will now pass every available moment afield,  eagerly watching for the return of old friends and more eagerly still  for possible new ones. But enjoyment of this yearly miracle should not  be left only to the initiated. We need not be ornithologists to be  thrilled when the Robin's song in March awakes long silent echoes, or  the Thrasher's solo"]]]
