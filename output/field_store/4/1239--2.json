MEMOIRS OF THE DUKES OF URBINO    Illustrating the Arms, Arts & Literature of Italy, 1440-1630    by    JAMES DENNISTOUN OF DENNISTOUN    A New Edition with Notes by Edward Hutton  & Over a Hundred Illustrations    In Three Volumes. VOLUME ONE                [Illustration]    London John Lane The Bodley Head  New York John Lane Company MCMIX    William Brendon and Son, Ltd., Printers, Plymouth          [Illustration: JAMES DENNISTOUN OF DENNISTOUN    _From a medallion in the possession of his Nephew, James N. Dennistoun  of Dennistoun_]          TO    EDMUND G. GARDNER    IN AFFECTIONATE ADMIRATION    THIS NEW EDITION OF A FAMOUS BOOK    IS DEDICATED    BY THE EDITOR          INTRODUCTION      It is surely unnecessary to make any apology for this second edition  of the _Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino_. Notwithstanding all that has  been done in the last fifty years by historians on the one hand, and  by imaginative writers on the other, with the object of elucidating  the history of that part of Central Italy which lies within the  ancient confines of Umbria, or of appreciating the humanism of that  Court which was once a pattern for the world, this book of James  Dennistoun's remains the standard authority to which every writer  within or without Italy must go in dealing in any way with these  subjects. This very honourable achievement has been won for the book  by the eager and methodical research of the author, who made himself  acquainted with all available original sources, and in the years of  his sojourn in Italy must have read and turned over a vast number of  MSS., of which some have since been printed in various _Bollettini_,  but a great number still remain in those Italian libraries which,  always without an efficient catalogue and often without an excuse for  one, are at once the delight and the despair of the curious student.  For this reason, if for no other, such a work as this was not easy to  supersede, and so, though a later writer always has an advantage, it  was not outmoded by the careful and loving work of Ugolini in his  _Storia de' Conti e Duchi d'Urbino_, which was written, I think, in  exile.    But Dennistoun's _Dukes of Urbino_ is not merely a history of the  houses of Montefeltro and Della Rovere, of their famous and most  brilliant Court, and of that part of Italy over which they held  dominion, but really a work in belles-lettres too, discursive and  amusing, as well as instructive. It deals not merely with history, as  it seems we have come to understand the word, a thing of politics--in  this case the futile and childish politics of the fifteenth and  sixteenth centuries in Italy--but illustrates \"the arms, arts, and  literature of Italy from 1440 to 1630.\" And indeed this programme was  carried out as well as it could be carried out at the time these  volumes were written. The book, which has long been almost  unprocurable, is full, as it were, of a great leisure, crammed with  all sorts of out-of-the-way learning and curious tales and adventures.  Sometimes failing in art, and often we may think in judgment,  Dennistoun never fails in this, that he is always interested in the  people he writes of, interested in their quarrels and love affairs,  their hair-breadth escapes and good fortunes. How eagerly he sides  with Duke Guidobaldo, chased out of his city of Urbino by Cesare  Borgia! It is as though he were assisting at that sudden flight at  midnight, and, whole-heartedly the Duke's man as he was, almost fails  to understand what Cesare was aiming at, and quite fails to see what  Cesare saw too well--the helplessness of Italy, at the mercy, really,  of the unconscious nations of the modern world. Such failures as this  make his work, indispensable as it is, less valuable than it might  have been, but they by no means detract from the general interest of  the story. That is a quarry from which much has been hewn, and a good  many of those enduring blocks which go to make up so popular and  charming a work as _John Inglesant_ came in the first instance from  Dennistoun's volumes.    A second edition then, of such a work, as it seems to me, needs no  excuse. What must, perhaps, be excused is my part in it, the intrusion  of another personality into what was so completely the author's own.  Yet I can truly say that I have intruded myself as little as  possible, and, indeed, so far as the text goes, it stands almost as  Dennistoun left it, with the correction of such errata as were due  partly to the printers and partly to the oversight of the author. The  notes which have been my business, my only part in the work, have  filled the leisure of three years. They are far from being complete,  and are imperfect in a thousand ways, as I know perhaps better than  any one else, but they are as good and as useful as I could make them,  and represent in some sort the work not of three years, but of ten. As  for my intention in republishing Dennistoun's book with notes from my  hand, I can frankly say that I undertook it from a love of all that  concerns Italy, and especially Umbria, and therefore I have worked at  it with joy through the long winter evenings, and in summer I have  often raised my eyes from my manuscript to watch the dawn rise over  Urbino and the beautiful great hills among which she is throned. And  you, too, had you watched her thus, would have been sure that no  labour of love could be too great for her. And then Dennistoun's book  is so fine a monument of the love England has always borne to Italy.  And I would be concerned in that too. Yet sometimes I have thought  that, in spite of all my labour--and, though I loved it, labour it  was--rather than sitting down to annotate another man's work, I should  have done better to write my own. Friends, such as one must hear, were  neither slow nor without persistence in impressing this upon me. I  heard them and shook my head. I am not an historian, but a man of  letters. This book is, after all, the work of one who thought well of  facts, while I cannot abide them. For one idea, as I know well, I  would give all the facts in the world. So the writing of history is  not for me; for history is become a sort of science, and is no longer  an art. And therefore I gladly leave her to the friend to whom I  humbly dedicate my edition of this book, and to the virile embraces  of Mr. William Heywood, who first led me into this nightmare of facts  from which I am but just escaped. Let them settle it between them. For  me there remains all the uncertainties that, God be thanked, can never  be decided or be proved merely to have happened.    Thinking thus, I soon gave up any thought of writing the history of  the Counts and Dukes of Urbino myself, and turned a deaf ear to those  who would tempt me to it. I went on with my notes, however, partly  from the joy one feels in playing with fire and all such mysterious  and dangerous things, and partly from a hope that one day they might  serve in some sort as finger-posts to an Englishman who should take up  this subject and study it over again, from the beginning, more simply  than Dennistoun was able to do.    As for Dennistoun's book, it always had my love, and day by day as I  have worked through and through it, it has won my respect. Full of  digressions, a little long-drawn-out, sometimes short-sighted,  sometimes pedantic, it is written with a whole-hearted devotion to the  truth and to the country which he loved. The facts are wonderfully  sound, and if that part of the book for which it was most highly  praised when it was first published--the chapters that deal with the  history of Art--is become that which we can praise least, we must  remember that in art, in painting more than anything else, fashion is  king, and that the thrones from which we have driven Guido Reni, and  perhaps Raphael, setting up in their stead other masters, are as  likely as not to be in the possession of usurpers to-morrow, and we in  as bad a case as our fathers.    Perhaps I may say a word about the illustrations. The book was one  which lent itself very easily to illustration, and the great  generosity of the publisher in this matter has been of the greatest  satisfaction to me. I have sought in selecting my pictures to reflect  the spirit of the book, which concerns itself with many a hundred  things besides the Counts and Dukes of Urbino.

INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.                    We take no note of time      But from its loss; to give it, then, a tongue      Is wise in man.                                     DR. YOUNG.      TO give a language to time, for the preservation of its records and the  utterance of its lessons, has been amongst the occupations of man from  the day when first he found himself in its mysterious presence down to  these latter ages of the world; and yet, all the resources of his  ingenuity, impelled by all the aspirations of his heart, have only  succeeded in supplying it with an imperfect series of hieroglyphics,  difficult in their acquirement and uncertain in their use. Ages upon  ages of the young world have passed away, of which the old hath no  chronicle. Generations after generations of men have \"made their bed in  the darkness,\" and left no monuments. Of the crowded memorials reared by  others along the stream of time, many (and those the mightiest) are  written in a cipher of which the key is lost. The wrappings of the mummy  are letters of a dead language; and no man can translate the ancient  story of the pyramid!    We have learnt to speak of time, because it is that portion of eternity  with which we have _presently_ to do,--as if it were a whit more  intelligible (less vague, abstract, and unimaginable) than that eternity  of which it is a part. He who can conceive of the one, must be able to  embrace the awful image of the other. We think of time as of a section  of eternity, separated and intrenched by absolute _limits_; and thus we  seem to have arrived at a definite idea, surrounded by points on which  the mind can rest. But when the imagination sets out upon the actual  experiment, and discovers that those limits are not assignable, save on  one only side, and finds but a single point on which to rest its failing  wing, and looks from thence along an expanse whose boundaries are  nowhere else within the range of its restricted vision,--then does the  mortal bird return into its mortal nest, wearied with its ineffectual  flight, and convinced that a shoreless ocean and one whose shores it  cannot see are alike formless and mysterious to its dim and feeble gaze.    And yet notwithstanding the connection of these two ideas,--of time and  of eternity,--(the notion of the former being only reached through the  latter) we deal familiarly, and even jestingly, with the one, while the  mind approaches the other with reverential awe. Types, and symbols, and  emblems--and those ever of a grave meaning--are the most palpable  expressions which we venture to give to our conceptions of the one;  whilst the other we figure and personify,--and that, too often, after a  fashion in which the better part of the moral is left unrepresented. Yet  who shall personify time? And who that has ever tried it, in the silence  of his chamber and the stillness of his heart, hath not bowed down in  breathless awe before the solemn visions which his conjuration has  awakened? Oh, the mysterious shapes which Time takes, when it rises up  into the mind as an image, at those hours of lonely inquisition!--\"And  he said unto her, 'What form is he of?' And she said, 'An _old man_  cometh up; and he is _covered with a mantle_.'\"--The mysterious presence  which it assumes \"in"]]]
