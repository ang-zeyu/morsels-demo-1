Data on movement of marked fish                            416          INTRODUCTION      This report concerns the ability of fish-populations in the Neosho and  Marais des Cygnes rivers in Kansas to readjust to continuous stream-flow  following intermittent conditions resulting from the severest drought in  the history of the State.    The variable weather in Kansas (and in other areas of the Great Plains)  markedly affects its flora and fauna. Weaver and Albertson (1936)  reported as much as 91 per cent loss in the basal prairie vegetative  cover in Kansas near the close of the drought of the 1930's. The average  annual cost (in 1951 prices) of floods in Kansas from 1926 to 1953 was  $35,000,000. In the same period the average annual loss from the  droughts of the 1930's and 1950's was $75,000,000 (in 1951 prices),  excluding losses from wind- and soil-erosion. Thus, over a period of 28  years, the average annual flood-losses were less than one-half the  average annual drought-losses (Foley, Smrha, and Metzler, 1955:9;  Anonymous, 1958:15).    Weather conditions in Kansas from 1951 to 1957 were especially  noteworthy: 1951 produced a bumper crop of climatological events  significant to the economy of the State. Notable among these were:  Wettest year since beginning of the state-wide weather records in 1887;  highest river stages since settlement of the State on the Kansas River  and on most of its tributaries, as well as on the Marais des Cygnes and  on the Neosho and Cottonwood. The upper Arkansas and a number of smaller  streams in western Kansas also experienced unprecedented flooding  (Garrett, 1951:147). This period of damaging floods was immediately  followed by the driest five-year period on record, culminating in the  driest year in 1956 (Garrett, 1958:56). Water shortage became serious  for many communities. The Neosho River usually furnishes adequate  quantities of water for present demands, but in some years of drought  all flow ceases for several consecutive months. In 1956-'57, the city of  Chanute, on an emergency basis, recirculated treated sewage for potable  supply (Metzler _et al._, 1958). The water shortage in many communities  along the Neosho River became so serious that a joint project to pump  water from the Smoky Hill River into the upper Neosho was considered,  and preliminary investigations were made. If the drought had continued  through 1957, this program might have been vigorously promoted. Data on  stream-flow in the Neosho and Marais des Cygnes (1951-'59) are presented  in Tables 1-4.    These severe conditions provided a unique opportunity to gain insight  into the ability of several species of fish to adjust to marked changes  in their environment. For this reason, and because of a paucity of  information concerning stream-fish populations in Kansas, the study here  reported on was undertaken.      TABLE 1.

PREPARER'S NOTE: In order to make this file more accessible to the  average computer user, the preparer has found it necessary to re-arrange  some of the material. The preparer takes full responsibility for his  choice of arrangement.    A few endnotes have been added by the preparer, and some additions have  been supplied to the original endnotes of Mr. Evelyn-White's. Where this  occurs I have noted the addition with my initials \"DBK\". Some endnotes,  particularly those concerning textual variations in the ancient Greek  text, are here omitted.          PREFACE    This volume contains practically all that remains of the post-Homeric  and pre-academic epic poetry.    I have for the most part formed my own text. In the case of Hesiod I  have been able to use independent collations of several MSS. by Dr.  W.H.D. Rouse; otherwise I have depended on the apparatus criticus of  the several editions, especially that of Rzach (1902). The arrangement  adopted in this edition, by which the complete and fragmentary poems are  restored to the order in which they would probably have appeared had  the Hesiodic corpus survived intact, is unusual, but should not need  apology; the true place for the \"Catalogues\" (for example), fragmentary  as they are, is certainly after the \"Theogony\".    In preparing the text of the \"Homeric Hymns\" my chief debt--and it is a  heavy one--is to the edition of Allen and Sikes (1904) and to the series  of articles in the \"Journal of Hellenic Studies\" (vols. xv.sqq.) by T.W.  Allen. To the same scholar and to the Delegates of the Clarendon Press I  am greatly indebted for permission to use the restorations of the \"Hymn  to Demeter\", lines 387-401 and 462-470, printed in the Oxford Text of  1912.    Of the fragments of the Epic Cycle I have given only such as seemed to  possess distinct importance or interest, and in doing so have relied  mostly upon Kinkel's collection and on the fifth volume of the Oxford  Homer (1912).    The texts of the \"Batrachomyomachia\" and of the \"Contest of Homer and  Hesiod\" are those of Baumeister and Flach respectively: where I have  diverged from these, the fact has been noted.    Hugh G. Evelyn-White, Rampton, NR. Cambridge. Sept. 9th, 1914.          INTRODUCTION          General    The early Greek epic--that is, poetry as a natural and popular, and not  (as it became later) an artificial and academic literary form--passed  through the usual three phases, of development, of maturity, and of  decline.    No fragments which can be identified as belonging to the first period  survive to give us even a general idea of the history of the earliest  epic, and we are therefore thrown back upon the evidence of analogy  from other forms of literature and of inference from the two great  epics which have come down to us. So reconstructed, the earliest period  appears to us as a time of slow development in which the characteristic  epic metre, diction, and structure grew up slowly from crude elements  and were improved until the verge of maturity was reached.    The second period, which produced the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", needs  no description here: but it is very important to observe the effect  of these poems on the course of post-Homeric epic. As the supreme  perfection and universality of the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" cast into  oblivion whatever pre-Homeric poets had essayed, so these same qualities  exercised a paralysing influence over the successors of Homer. If they  continued to sing like their great predecessor of romantic themes, they  were drawn as by a kind of magnetic attraction into the Homeric style  and manner of treatment, and became mere echoes of the Homeric voice: in  a word, Homer had so completely exhausted the epic genre, that after him  further efforts were doomed to be merely conventional. Only the rare  and exceptional genius of Vergil and Milton could use the Homeric medium  without loss of individuality: and this quality none of the later epic  poets seem to have possessed. Freedom from the domination of the great  tradition could only be found by seeking new subjects, and such freedom  was really only illusionary, since romantic subjects alone are suitable  for epic treatment.    In its third period, therefore, epic poetry shows two divergent  tendencies. In Ionia and the islands the epic poets followed the Homeric  tradition, singing of romantic subjects in the now stereotyped heroic  style, and showing originality only in their choice of legends hitherto  neglected or summarily and imperfectly treated. In continental Greece  [1101], on the other hand, but especially in Boeotia, a new form of  epic sprang up, which for the romance and PATHOS of the Ionian School  substituted the practical and matter-of-fact. It dealt in moral and  practical maxims, in information on technical subjects which are  of service in daily life--agriculture, astronomy, augury, and the  calendar--in matters of religion and in tracing the genealogies of men.  Its attitude is summed up in the words of the Muses to the writer of the  \"Theogony\": `We can tell many a feigned tale to look like truth, but we  can, when we will, utter the truth' (\"Theogony\" 26-27). Such a poetry  could not be permanently successful, because the subjects of which it  treats--if susceptible of poetic treatment at all--were certainly not  suited for epic treatment, where unity of action which will sustain  interest, and to which each part should contribute, is absolutely  necessary. While, therefore, an epic like the \"Odyssey\" is an organism  and dramatic in structure, a work such as the \"Theogony\" is a merely  artificial collocation of facts, and, at best, a pageant. It is not  surprising, therefore, to find that from the first the Boeotian school  is forced to season its matter with romantic episodes, and that later  it tends more and more to revert (as in the \"Shield of Heracles\") to the  Homeric tradition.          The Boeotian School    How did the continental school of epic poetry arise? There is little  definite material for an answer to this question, but the probability is  that there were at least three contributory causes. First, it is likely  that before the rise of the Ionian epos there existed in Boeotia a  purely popular and indigenous poetry of a crude form: it comprised,  we may suppose, versified proverbs and precepts relating to life in  general, agricultural maxims, weather-lore, and the like. In this sense  the Boeotian poetry may be taken to have its germ in maxims similar to  our English         'Till May be out, ne'er cast a clout,'    or         'A rainbow in the morning       Is the Shepherd's warning.'    Secondly and thirdly we may ascribe the rise of the new epic to the  nature of the Boeotian people and, as already remarked, to a spirit of  revolt against the old epic. The Boeotians, people of the class of which  Hesiod represents himself to be the type, were essentially unromantic;  their daily needs marked the general limit of their ideals, and, as a  class, they cared little for works of fancy, for pathos, or for fine  thought as such. To a people of this nature the Homeric epos would  be inacceptable, and the post-Homeric epic, with its conventional  atmosphere, its trite and hackneyed diction, and its insincere  sentiment, would be anathema. We can imagine, therefore, that among  such folk a settler, of Aeolic origin like Hesiod, who clearly was  well acquainted with the Ionian epos, would naturally see that the  only outlet for his gifts lay in applying epic poetry to new themes  acceptable to his hearers.    Though the poems of the Boeotian school [1102] were unanimously assigned  to Hesiod down to the age of Alexandrian criticism, they were clearly  neither the work of one man nor even of one period: some, doubtless,  were fraudulently fathered on him in order to gain currency; but it is  probable that most came to be regarded as his partly because of their  general character, and partly because the names of their real authors  were lost. One fact in this attribution is remarkable--the veneration  paid to Hesiod.      Life of Hesiod    Our information respecting Hesiod is derived in the main from notices  and allusions in the works attributed to him, and to these must be added  traditions concerning his death and burial gathered from later writers.    Hesiod's father (whose name, by a perversion of \"Works and Days\", 299  PERSE DION GENOS to PERSE, DION GENOS, was thought to have been Dius)  was a native of Cyme in Aeolis, where he was a seafaring trader and,  perhaps, also a farmer. He was forced by poverty to leave his native  place, and returned to continental Greece, where he settled at Ascra  near Thespiae in Boeotia (\"Works and Days\", 636 ff.). Either in Cyme or  Ascra, two sons, Hesiod and Perses, were born to the settler, and these,  after his death, divided the farm between them. Perses, however, who is  represented as an idler and spendthrift, obtained and kept the larger  share by bribing the corrupt 'lords' who ruled from Thespiae (\"Works  and Days\", 37-39). While his brother wasted his patrimony and ultimately  came to want (\"Works and Days\", 34 ff.)"]]]
