B. LIPPINCOTT & CO.    LONDON: J CHURCHILL & SONS.    1869.            TO    MISS BURDETT COUTTS.        MADAM,    The numerous services which you have rendered, and the interest you have  shown in the calamitous epizootic which at this moment decimates the  noble herds of England, have prompted me to dedicate the following pages  to you, satisfied that I am only giving public expression to the homage  felt for you by many of your fellow-countrymen.    I have the honour to be, Madam,      With respect, your obedient servant,      H. BOURGUIGNON.          PREFACE.      Nations, during the successive phases of their evolution on the globe,  in which they advance from a state of infancy and barbarism to one of  virility and civilization, from civilization to decadence or senility;  and from decadence to their final extinction, are liable to numberless  calamities.    These calamities are produced by moral causes, and are then called  social Revolutions; and in other instances from physical causes, and  then they are termed Cataclysms, Epidemics, or Epizootics.    In these crises, the initiative and devotion of individuals, the public  administration, and the application of knowledge acquired in the Arts  and Sciences, afford collectively an infallible criterion for  ascertaining the position which a nation occupies in the scale of  civilization, and the value of its religious, social, and political  institutions.    Calamities always leave behind them disasters and victims, but they  bequeath also a precious legacy. Nations which are called upon for fresh  and progressive efforts, find in the experience they have gained a new  source of strength and means of future greatness. I am convinced that  this will be the case with England; though, helpless for the moment, and  unable to stay the Cattle Plague which now ravages her entire extent,  she will in future be found better prepared to resist the inroads of  such a direful enemy.    No branch of human knowledge has been more rudely tested during the  present epizootic than medical science. Many persons have been astounded  at its helplessness; but if they had reflected at what a distance  medicine has to follow in the wake of the exact sciences by which it is  furnished with instruments for prosecuting its researches,--that  organic chemistry progresses but slowly,--that the Cattle Plague was  entirely unknown to the present generation of medical men in  England,--and that the means for its scientific and practical study have  been therefore wholly wanting, they would have been less surprised to  find that it is as difficult to cure the Cattle Plague as it, is to cure  phthisis, cancer, hydrophobia, and the cholera, against which medicine  but too often is of little avail.    In times of great national calamity it behoves every one to contribute  in proportion to his talents, fortune, or abilities, to alleviate the  effects of the common misfortune. The poor man's mite, and the honest  intention of the most insignificant, when added to the budget of common  efforts, have their relative value; and it is for these reasons that I  have published the following monograph on the Cattle Plague.    If it assists in any way to the extinction of the present epizootic, or  if it serve to point out the necessity of combining the study of  comparative pathology with that of medicine, I shall feel that I have  contributed something which may favour my claim to be enrolled among the  citizens of England.    This book, as may easily be seen, was originally written in my native  language. A few kind and obliging friends--more particularly Mr. Taylor  Sinnett, Drs. Clapton and Gervis, of St. Thomas's Hospital, and Mr.  Berridge, of the British Museum--have rendered me the greatest  assistance in the translation. Without the guidance of such competent  auxiliaries I could not have performed my arduous task.    I therefore beg to return to those gentlemen, and to all those who have  assisted me on this occasion, my sincerest and most grateful thanks.      H. B.

Various Documents                                               337          INTRODUCTION.      Everyone is talking of the CATTLE PLAGUE! But why should we  borrow this sinister and gloomy denomination from the middle ages and  from the people's vocabulary? Is this, then, an unknown and incurable  disease? Is this the first time that it has made its appearance on the  soil of Great Britain? To judge by the manner in which the diffusion of  this complaint has been met, accounted for, explained, and discussed,  one might imagine it was so; and yet the mere observation of its causes,  its symptoms, and its signs and effects on the bodies of the diseased  animals, besides a few references to the medical library, would easily  have testified that nature did not wait until the second half of the  19th century to generate a new distemper. No! Nothing new has appeared  for a long time in the worlds of space. The cosmic phenomena pursue  their perpetual course, and the organic phenomena, _a fortiori_, do the  same. Life, throughout the whole range of the animal kingdom, whatever  may be its changes and fluctuations, submits to the fixed and invariable  laws which hold dominion over health and disease. Our presumption and  ignorance alone can account for the astonishment we manifest, not only  when we witness great general calamities, but even when we look upon  those simple morbid derangements which organic matter, both animal and  vegetable, is continually undergoing on the globe, in the natural  progress of destruction and dissolution.    The habit we most of us have contracted of confining our observations to  the phenomena which strike our eyes, instead of fixing them on the  general causes by which these phenomena have been produced; the  forgetfulness of some, in others the want of acquaintance with general  and comparative pathology, have in this instance led many conscientious  inquirers to misapprehend both the nature and the treatment of the  cattle complaint. It is in vain that we have subdivided and classed  medical science--in vain that we have arbitrarily instituted a  veterinary medicine and a human medicine; nature, in her acts, has no  such subtleties. With nature, organic matter is organic matter, life is  life; and although it may be true that both organic matter and life  become more complex, and continue to rise in perfection till they reach  man, it is quite as true that the laws of pathology and physiology are  the same in all, and that it is just as difficult to cure the typhus of  the ox as that of man. As, therefore, it is because we overlooked these  fundamental truths, that the outbreak of the cattle distemper found us  unprepared, we must treat the subject with all the gravity which is its  due.    Let it not, however, be feared that the special fact of the _so-called_  Cattle Plague will be lost sight of amidst a crowd of scientific  generalities.

EDITOR'S PREFACE.      Dr. N. Annandale's volume on the Freshwater SPONGES, POLYZOA, and  HYDRIDA contains an account of three of the chief groups of freshwater  organisms. Although he deals mainly with Indian forms the book contains  an unusually full account of the life-history and bionomics of  freshwater Sponges, Polyzoa, and Hydrozoa.    I have to thank Dr. Annandale for the great care he has taken in the  preparation of his manuscript for the press, and also the Trustees of  the Indian Museum, Calcutta, for their kindness in placing material at  the disposal of the Author.
