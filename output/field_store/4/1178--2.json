AUTHOR'S PREFACE.      When I first brought my wife out to India in 1873, I was struck by  the comments she made on things which had so long been part of my  daily life. I had almost ceased to observe them. Every day she noted  something new, and her diary was so interesting that I advised her  to write a book on her \"First Impressions of India,\" and she meant  to do so, but never had time. Had she lived, this would have been a  pleasure to her, but it was otherwise ordained. I feel now that I am  in some way carrying out her wishes, by attempting a description of  our life in India, though I am fully sensible that I cannot hope to  achieve the pleasant chatty style in which she excelled.    I have also striven to give a fair record of the events with which I  was connected; and perhaps, as they include a description of a state  of things that has passed away for ever, they may not be devoid of  interest. I am one of those old-fashioned Anglo-Indians who still  believe in personal government, a system by which we gained India,  solidified our rule, and made ourselves fairly acceptable to the  people whom we govern. I believe the machine-like system which we have  introduced and are endeavouring to force into every corner of India,  till all personal influence is killed out, to be ill-adapted to the  requirements of these Oriental races, and blighting in its effects. Not  one native chief has adopted it in its integrity, which is in itself  a fair argument that it is distasteful to the native mind; and we may  be assured that if we evacuated India to-morrow, personal rule would  again make itself felt throughout the length and breadth of the land,  and grow stronger every day. I have always striven to be a reformer,  but a reformer building on the solid foundations that we already find  everywhere in India. Wherever you go, if there is a semblance of  native rule left, you find a system admirably adapted to the needs  of the population, though very often grown over with abuses. Clear  away these abuses, and add a little in the way of modern progress,  but always building on the foundation you find ready to hand, and  you have a system acceptable to all.    We are wonderfully timid in sweeping away real abuses, for fear of  hurting the feelings of the people; at the same time we weigh them  down with unnecessary, oppressive, and worrying forms, and deluge the  country with paper returns, never realising that these cause far more  annoyance than would be felt at our making some radical change in a  matter which, after all, affects only a minority. Take, for instance,  the case of suttee, or widow-burning. It was argued for years that  we could not put it down without causing a rebellion. What are the  facts? A governor-general, blessed with moral courage in a great  degree, determined to abolish the barbarous custom, and his edict  was obeyed without a murmur. So it has been in many other cases,  and so it will be wherever we have the courage to do the right  thing. An unpopular tax would cause more real dissatisfaction than  any interference with bad old customs, only adhered to from innate  conservatism. The great principle on which to act is to do what  is right, and what commends itself to common sense, and to try and  carry the people with you. Do not let us have more mystery than is  necessary; telling the plain truth is the best course; vacillation  is fatal; the strongest officer is generally the most popular, and  is remembered by the people long after he is dead and gone.    Personal rule is doomed, and men born to be personal rulers and a  blessing to the governed, are now harassed by the authorities till  they give up in despair, and swim with the stream.    The machine system did not gain India, and will not keep it for us;  we must go back to a better system, or be prepared to relax our  grasp, and give up the grandest work any nation ever undertook--the  regeneration of an empire!    The House of Commons has to answer for much. No Indian administration  is safe from the interference of theorists. To-day it is opium that  is attacked by self-righteous individuals, who see in the usual, and  in most cases harmless, stimulant of millions, a crying evil; while  they view with apparent complacency the expenditure of L120,000,000  per annum on intoxicating liquors in England, and long columns in  almost every newspaper recording brutal outrages on helpless women  and children as the result.    Then the military administration is attacked, and in pursuance of  another chimera, an iniquitous bill is forced on the Government  of India calculated to produce results, which will probably sap  the efficiency of our army at a critical moment. So it goes on,  and it is hardly to be wondered at that the authorities in India  give up resistance in sheer disgust, knowing all the while that,  as the French say, le deluge must come after them.    It may be said, \"What has all this to do with Manipur and the Naga  Hills?\" Nothing perhaps directly, but indirectly a great deal. The  system which I decry carries its evil influence everywhere, and Manipur  has suffered from it. I describe the Naga Hills and Manipur as they  were in old days. I strove hard for years to hold the floods back from  this little State and to preserve it intact, while doing all I could  to introduce reforms. Now the floods have overwhelmed it, and if it  rises again above them it will not be the Manipur that I knew and  loved. May it, in spite of my doubts and fears, be a better Manipur.

The circumstance that the military authorities have  been obliged to look to foreign countries for supplies of such horses  for the war in South Africa has suggested the propriety of pointing out  that we possess in England foundation stock from which we may be able to  raise a breed of small horses equal to, or better than, any we are now  obliged to procure abroad._    _Elsenham Hall, Essex, May, 1900._          SMALL HORSES IN WARFARE.      The campaign in South Africa has proved beyond doubt the necessity for a  strong force similar to that of the Boers. Their rapidity of movement  has given us an important lesson in the military value of horses of that  useful type which is suitable for light cavalry and mounted infantry.    Since the war broke out we have seen that we possess numbers of men able  to ride and shoot, who only need a little training to develop them into  valuable soldiers, but our difficulty throughout has been to provide  horses of the stamp required for the work they have to perform. The  experience we have gained in South Africa goes to confirm that acquired  in the Crimea, where it was found that the horses sent out from England  were unable to withstand the climate, poor food, and the hardships to  which they were subjected, while the small native horses and those bred  in countries further East suffered little from these causes. It was  then proved beyond dispute that these small horses are both hardy and  enduring, while, owing to their possession like our English  thoroughbreds of a strong strain of Arab blood, they were speedy enough  for light cavalry purposes.    Breeders of every class of horse, saving only those who breed the  Shetland pony and the few who aim at getting ponies for polo, have for  generations made it their object to obtain increased height. There is  nothing to be urged against this policy in so far as certain breeds are  concerned; the sixteen-hand thoroughbred with his greater stride is more  likely to win races than the horse of fifteen two; the sixteen-hand  carriage horse, other qualities being equal, brings a better price than  one of less stature; and the Shire horse of 16.2 or 17 hands has  commonly in proportion greater strength and weight, the qualities most  desirable in him, than a smaller horse. Thus we can show excellent  reason for our endeavours to increase the height of our most valuable  breeds; and the long period that has elapsed since we were last called  upon to put forward our military strength has allowed us to lose sight  of the great importance of other qualities.    Breeders and horsemen are well aware, though the general public may not  know or may not realise the fact, that increased height in the horse  does not necessarily involve increased strength in all directions, such  as greater weight-carrying power and more endurance. Granting that the  saying, \"a good big horse is better than a good little one,\" is in the  main correct, we have to consider that the merits which go to make a  useful horse for campaigning are infinitely more common in small horses  than in big ones.    All the experience of campaigners, explorers and travellers goes to  prove that small compact animals between 13.2 and 14.2 hands high are  those on which reliance can be placed for hard and continuous work on  scanty and innutritious food.          HORSES IN THE CRIMEAN WAR.      During the Crimean War I was located for a short time at Abydos in Asia  Minor, on the shores of the Dardanelles, and had daily opportunities of  seeing the horses and studying the manoeuvres of some 3,000 mounted  Bashi Bazouks and Armenian troops who were encamped there under General  Beatson in readiness for summons to the Crimea, whither they were  eventually dispatched.    The horses on which these troops were mounted ranged from 14 hands to  14.3; all had a strong strain of Arab blood, and had come with the  troops from the Islands of the Archipelago. They were perfect horses for  light cavalry work. The economy with which they were fed was surprising:  their feed consisted principally of chopped straw with a small daily  ration of barley when the grain was procurable, which was not always the  case; and on this diet they continued in condition to endure long  journeys which would have speedily broken down the best English charger  in the British army.          CAPE HORSES.      The universal opinion of residents in South Africa is against the  introduction of imported horses for general work, inasmuch as they  cannot withstand the climate, hard living, bad roads and rough usage  which make up the conditions of a horse's life in the Colony.    In past years, before the present war, large numbers of English  horses have been sent to Natal for military service, but the results  were not satisfactory; all became useless, and the large majority died;  the change from English stables and English methods of management to  those in vogue in the Colony almost invariably proved fatal.      [Illustration: BASHI BAZOUK]    Some five years ago, when discussing with Mr. Cecil Rhodes the  advisability of introducing into Cape Colony English sires to improve  the stamp of horse bred in South Africa, he gave his opinion against  such measures. He pointed out that highly bred and large horses were  unsuitable for the work required in the Colony; they needed greater care  in housing, feeding, and grooming than the conditions of life in South  Africa would allow owners to bestow upon them. The hardships attendant  upon long journeys over rough country, the extremes of heat and cold  which horses must endure with insufficient shelter or none at all, must  inevitably overtax the stamina which has been weakened by generations of  luxurious existence in England.    Mr. Rhodes considered that no infusion of English blood would enhance  the powers of the small colonial bred horse to perform the work required  of him under local conditions; that though thoroughbred blood would  improve him in height and speed, these advantages would be obtained at  the cost of such indispensable qualities as endurance and ability to  thrive on poor and scanty fare.    It is however permissible to suppose that a gradual infusion of good  blood carefully chosen might in course of time benefit the Cape breed.  The use only of horses which have become acclimatised would perhaps  produce better results than have hitherto been obtained. The progeny  reared under the ordinary conditions prevailing in the Colony would  perpetuate good qualities, retaining the hardiness of the native breed.          PONIES IN THE SOUDAN.      The late Colonel P. H. S. Barrow furnished a most interesting and  suggestive Report to the War Office on the Arabs which were used by his  regiment, the 19th Hussars, during the Nile campaign of 1885. This  report is published among the Appendices to Colonel John Biddulph's  work, _The XIXth and their Times_ (1899).    Experience, in the words of Colonel Biddulph, had shown that English  horses could not stand hard work under a tropical sun with scarcity of  water and desert fare. It was therefore decided before leaving Cairo to  mount the regiment entirely on the small Syrian Arab horses used by the  Egyptian cavalry. Three hundred and fifty of these little horses had  been sent up in advance and were taken over by the regiment on arrival  at Wady Halfa. Colonel Barrow thus describes these horses:    \"Arab stallion. Average height, 14 hands; average age, 8 years to 9  years; some 15 per cent. over 12 years; bought by Egyptian Government in  Syria and Lower Egypt; average price, L18.\"    About half of the ponies had been through the campaign in the Eastern  Soudan with the regiment in February and March, 1884, and had returned  in a very exhausted state. In September of that year they were marched  up from Assouan to Wady Halfa, 210 miles; and when handed over to the  19th again in November, all except some 10 per cent. of the number were  \"in very fair marching condition.\" From Wady Halfa the regiment  proceeded to Korti, a distance of 360 miles, at a rate of about 16 miles  per day, halts, one of one day and one of two days not included; their  feed consisted of about 6 lbs. of barley or dhoora[1] and 10 lbs. of  dhoora stalk; and on this rather scanty ration the horses reached Korti  in very good condition. Here they remained for eighteen days, receiving  8 lbs. of green dhoora stalk daily instead of 8 lbs. dry; the rest and  change to green food produced improvement in their condition.    [1] Dhoora is a kind of millet cultivated throughout Asia and introduced  into the south of Europe; called also Indian millet and Guinea corn.    While the main body rested at Korti, a detachment of fifty went to  Gakdul, 100 miles distant, on reconnaissance; they"]]]
