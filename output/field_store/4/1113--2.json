APPLETON AND COMPANY      1, 3, and 5 BOND STREET      1883          \"The scoff, the curse--his people's heritage--        Have left upon his shrunken face their sting;        His eyes gleam like those of some hunted thing,      Against whose life implacable war men wage.      We read the Jew's face as one reads a page        Of his own nation's history, for there cling        About its lines, deep-worn with suffering,      The traces still of Israel's lordly age.\"        F. F. M.          PREFACE    TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.      Although the high literary art which Franzos possesses (the finer  quality of which has been preserved in this translation) is fully  admitted by intelligent Jews, the subject-matter of his book itself, its  _raison d'etre_, they have by no means relished. In a review of \"The  Jews of Barnow,\" published some months ago in a leading New York  journal, it was asserted by the writer that, from internal evidence,  Franzos must be a Jew. This statement was directly controverted by a  Jewish weekly of the highest standing. Still, we must believe that the  acumen of the New York reviewer was not at fault, because in a late  number of \"Blackwood's Magazine,\" which contained an interesting  criticism of Franzos and his book, it was asserted that the author is or  was a Jew. No man not born a Jew, perfectly familiar with all the phases  of Jewish life in Eastern Galicia, and in sympathy with them, could have  created this book. Franzos may have clothed Jews and Jewesses with  poetical raiment, given them melodramatic phrasings, but the gabardine,  caftan, love-locks, are visible--the whine, the nasal twang audible.    This denial that Franzos was a Jew, though apparently insignificant in  itself, and due, perhaps, to a want of acquaintance with the facts, is  still peculiarly indicative of a natural _travers_ of the Jewish mind.  Any description of the inner life of Jews, when written by a Jew, unless  it be laudatory, is particularly distasteful to Jews. No race cares to  have its failings exposed. From one of another creed such strictures may  be passed over with stolid indifference, but, from one of their own  blood, any censure, direct or applied, is considered by Jews in the  light of a sacrilege. With Jews it is ever a cry, \"It is a dirty bird  that fouls its own nest.\" Such acridity as a Goldwin Smith distills,  Jews laugh at; but when one of their kinsmen, a Mr. Montefiore, finds  fault with them, bidding them look for grace in another direction, then  at once a holy horror pervades them.    What Franzos describes is Jewish life pent up within the narrow limits  of some Galician town. Religious dislikes, racial hatreds kindled a  thousand years ago, have never been quenched. Though to-day in that town  a Jew could not be murdered, because it would be against the law, the  inclination to kill him, because he is a Jew, still exists. The simple  fact, that every Jew had been taught to read and write, had quickened  his brains. Through heredity he became, intellectually, superior to the  illiterate peasant, or townsfolk, who hemmed him in. The mental  phenomenon the Jew would present, under such conditions, would not be,  after all, so peculiar. He had but two ends in life, to work and pray.  Even his toil was restricted, for he could only engage in certain  callings. His solace was his religion. He might pray to his Maker, but  only in such set phrases as had been chosen for him. His God was by far  too sublime for him, poor worm, to address in such homely words as might  well up spontaneously from his own heart. A slave to tradition, bound  down by rote, the Jew had been taught that the least divergence from a  cut-and-dried ritual was heresy. Mental and physical isolation brought  about arrested development. The only wonder about this all is, that the  Jew in Eastern Europe, seeing a better chance for life beyond the pale  of his religion, had not broken bounds, and, abjuring his creed, found  outside of it an easier existence. Brushing aside that sentimentalism  which so often obscures considerations of this character, the chances of  security for an apostate Jew were not very certain. Travestied in the  guise of a Christian, he never could have looked like one. Stamped on  his features were all the marked characteristics of his Orientalism.  Even his tongue would have played him false, for the rabbi had forbidden  him the use of that language common to the state in which he lived. By  some complications brought about by the Jews themselves in Eastern  Europe, they are not always subjected to the same regulations as  Christians. Religious laws made for their own government, which  underpinned their social life, were rarely meddled with. In a primitive  society, necessarily ignorant, any accredited head, according to the  laws of sociology, must be a despotic one. A rabbi, then, in these  unknown towns, wielded almost the power of life and death. That modern  infliction of Boycotting has been borrowed directly from the Jews. For a  trivial divergence from common custom the punishment was severe. In  these Polish or Russian districts, thirty years ago, a Jew did not dare  read a Christian book.    What Franzos shows markedly in his \"Jews of Barnow\" is that barrier  which Jews throw around their household. The seclusion of the family, so  purely Oriental in its character, is something which the Polish rabbi  takes particular pains to teach. This hiding, of what is the finest  trait the Jew possesses, that love and peace which dwell in his home,  that reverence which children have for their parents, that sacrifice of  everything to his affections, because it never is known, has tended more  than anything else to alienate the Jew from his neighbor. Among the  ultra-orthodox Jews, whether they live in Odessa, Cracow, Frankfort,  London, or New York, their doors are inhospitably closed to those of  another belief. Has there been transmitted some instinct engendered by  mistrust?    Is Judaism, then, so sensitive a plant that it should wither by mere  contact? If, to live, it must have seclusion, it approaches closely to  the Eastern's idea of a woman's virtue, something wanting the protection  of high walls and difficult approaches. In our age, any religion which  requires exclusiveness so that it may exist is hardly worth the keeping.    Franzos's stories exhibit those barbarities even now practiced under the  sacred name of religion. There are Jews who are not merely galled by the  opprobrium which in some places is still attached to their race, but are  sincerely desirous of removing it. Franzos, because he describes what is  the iron law of Talmudical or rabbinical tradition, shows how  superstition degrades the man. It is difficult at this day, when  research and modern methods of criticism have thrown such a flood of  light on the past, to realize the mental condition of that vast body of  Jews at the time of the commencement of the Christian era and the  destruction of Jerusalem. The whole national and municipal  administration of the country was in the hands of the priesthood. Every  law, every ordinance, every police and sanitary regulation, became a  religious obligation. Every action in every man's family, whether social  or political, was regulated for him by rules handed down from former  generations, and these rules were barnacled by conventionalisms. For his  guidance in the most commonplace actions, a Jew had perforce recourse to  his rabbi. As must always be the case, when municipal administration  emanates from a church, religious observances override legal or social  obligations. With the crucifixion of Christ came that hatred of Jews,  the intensity of which can only now be measured by its continuance. The  exclusion of Jews from the society and communion of mankind petrified  into marble-like hardness all those existing traditions which guided the  Jew's methods of life. Forbidden by every conceivable form of oppression  and disability from accompanying the rest of mankind on their march  toward a higher civilization, every advance, mental or physical, denied  them, it was as if a hot iron had been seared over the bloody wound  which had lopped them off from the family of nations. It is a wonder  that all future growth was not arrested. As to the charge of tribalism  (the writer acknowledging that the vast majority of Jews believe in it),  and even according some unknown and undefined power as derivable from  tribalism, to make a charge of this is but to repeat the old fable of  the wolf and the lamb.    All that intelligent Jews are doing to-day is to take advantage of their  freedom. They are trying to rid themselves of that incubus which has  been weighing them down. That large and increasing number of Reformers  and Reform synagogues, springing up in the large cities of Western  Europe and the United States; the decadence, the difficulty of  maintaining synagogues of pure orthodox Jews; the complaints, the  lamentations which are constantly heard from the mouths of orthodox  ministers and their organs, over what they call \"the neglect of  religious observance,\" show that the time of change has come. Even among  some of the orthodox, the gross superstitions accompanying the offerings  (auction-sales of God's blessings, knocked down to the highest bidder)  have been for the major part abolished. Efforts are continually made to  modify the ritual by denationalizing the older-fashioned form of prayer,  and giving it more of that spiritual life which Maimonides first  developed.

Henri Fabre,  translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chapters 13 and 18 to 20;  and Chapter 11 of the present volume.--Translator's Note.), the Bembex  (Cf. idem: chapter 14.--Translator's Note.), Gad-fly, the Cerceris (Cf.  idem: chapters 1 to 3.--Translator's Note.), Buprestis (A Beetle  usually remarkable for her brilliant colouring. Cf. idem: chapter  1.--Translator's Note.) and Weevil, the Sphex (Cf. idem: chapter 4 to  10.--Translator's Note.), Locust, Cricket and Ephippiger (Cf. \"The Life  of the Grasshopper,\" by J. Henri Fabre, translated by Alexander  Teixeira de Mattos: chapters 13 and 14.--Translator's Note.): all  these inoffensive peaceable victims are like the silly Sheep of our  slaughter-houses; they allow themselves to be operated upon by the  paralyser, submitting stupidly, without offering much resistance. The  mandibles gape, the legs kick and protest, the body wriggles and twists;  and that is all. They have no weapons capable of contending with the  assassin's dagger. I should like to see the huntress grappling with  an imposing adversary, one as crafty as herself, an expert layer of  ambushes and, like her, bearing a poisoned dirk. I should like to see  the bandit armed with her stiletto confronted by another bandit equally  familiar with the use of that weapon. Is such a duel possible? Yes, it  is quite possible and even quite common. On the one hand we have the  Pompili, the protagonists who are always victorious; on the other hand  we have the Spiders, the protagonists who are always overthrown.    Who that has diverted himself, however little, with the study of insects  does not know the Pompili? Against old walls, at the foot of the banks  beside unfrequented footpaths, in the stubble after the harvest, in the  tangles of dry grass, wherever the Spider spreads her nets, who has not  seen them busily at work, now running hither and thither, at random,  their wings raised and quivering above their backs, now moving from  place to place in flights long or short? They are hunting for a quarry  which might easily turn the tables and itself prey upon the trapper  lying in wait for it.    The Pompili feed their larvae solely on Spiders; and the Spiders feed on  any insect, commensurate with their size, that is caught in their nets.  While the first possess a sting, the second have two poisoned fangs.  Often their strength is equally matched; indeed the advantage is  not seldom on the Spider's side. The Wasp has her ruses of war, her  cunningly premeditated strokes: the Spider has her wiles and her set  traps; the first has the advantage of great rapidity of movement, while  the second is able to rely upon her perfidious web; the one has a sting  which contrives to penetrate the exact point to cause paralysis, the  other has fangs which bite the back of the neck and deal sudden death.  We find the paralyser on the one hand and the slaughterer on the other.  Which of the two will become the other's prey?    If we consider only the relative strength of the adversaries, the power  of their weapons, the virulence of their poisons and their different  modes of action, the scale would very often be weighted in favour of the  Spider. Since the Pompilus always emerges victorious from this contest,  which appears to be full of peril for her, she must have a special  method, of which I would fain learn the secret.    In our part of the country, the most powerful and courageous  Spider-huntress is the Ringed Pompilus (Calicurgus annulatus, FAB.),  clad in black and yellow. She stands high on her legs; and her wings  have black tips, the rest being yellow, as though exposed to smoke, like  a bloater. Her size is about that of the Hornet (Vespa crabro). She is  rare. I see three or four of her in the course of the year; and I never  fail to halt in the presence of the proud insect, rapidly striding  through the dust of the fields when the dog-days arrive. Its audacious  air, its uncouth gait, its war-like bearing long made me suspect that  to obtain its prey it had to make some impossible, terrible, unspeakable  capture. And my guess was correct. By dint of waiting and watching  I beheld that victim; I saw it in the huntress' mandibles. It is the  Black-bellied Tarantula, the terrible Spider who slays a Carpenter-bee  or a Bumble-bee outright with one stroke of her weapon; the Spider who  kills a Sparrow or a Mole; the formidable creature whose bite would  perhaps not be without danger to ourselves. Yes, this is the bill of  fare which the proud Pompilus provides for her larva.    This spectacle, one of the most striking with which the Hunting Wasps  have ever provided me, has as yet been offered to my eyes but once; and  that was close beside my rural home, in the famous laboratory of the  harmas. (The enclosed piece of waste land on which the author studied  his insects in their native state. Cf. \"The Life of the Fly,\" by  J. Henri Fabre, translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chapter  1.--Translator's Note.) I can still see the intrepid poacher dragging by  the leg, at the foot of a wall, the monstrous prize which she had just  secured, doubtless at no great distance. At the base of the wall was a  hole, an accidental chink between some of the stones. The Wasp inspected  the cavern, not for the first time: she had already reconnoitred it  and the premises had satisfied her. The prey, deprived of the power of  movement, was waiting somewhere, I know not where; and the huntress had  gone back to fetch it and store it away. It was at this moment that  I met her. The Pompilus gave a last glance at the cave, removed a few  small fragments of loose mortar; and with that her preparations were  completed. The Lycosa (The Spider in question is known indifferently  as the Black-bellied Tarantula and the Narbonne Lycosa.--Translator's  Note.) was introduced, dragged along, belly upwards, by one leg. I  did not interfere. Presently the Wasp reappeared on the surface and  carelessly pushed in front of the hole the bits of mortar which she had  just extracted from it. Then she flew away. It was all over. The egg was  laid; the insect had finished for better or for worse; and I was able to  proceed with my examination of the burrow and its contents.    The Pompilus has done no digging. It is really an accidental hole with  spacious winding passages, the result of the mason's negligence and not  of the Wasp's industry. The closing of the cavity is quite as rough and  summary. A few crumbs of mortar, heaped up before the doorway, form a  barricade rather than a door. A mighty hunter makes a poor architect.  The Tarantula's murderess does not know how to dig a cell for her larva;  she does not know how to fill up the entrance by sweeping dust into it.  The first hole encountered at the foot of a wall contents her, provided  that it be roomy enough; a little heap of rubbish will do for a door.  Nothing could be more expeditious.    I withdraw the game from the hole. The egg is stuck to the Spider, near  the beginning of the belly. A clumsy movement on my part makes it fall  off at the moment of extraction. It is all over: the thing will not  hatch; I shall not be able to observe the development of the larva. The  Tarantula lies motionless, flexible as in life, with not a trace of a  wound. In short, we have here life without movement. From time to time  the tips of the tarsi quiver a little; and that is all. Accustomed of  old to these deceptive corpses, I can see in my mind's eye what has  happened: the Spider has been stung in the region of the thorax, no  doubt once only, in view of the concentration of her nervous system. I  place the victim in a box in which it retains all the pliancy and all  the freshness of life from the 2nd of August to the 20th of September,  that is to say, for seven weeks. These miracles are familiar to us (Cf.  \"The Hunting"]]]
