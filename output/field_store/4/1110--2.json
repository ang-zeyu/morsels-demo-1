In connection with the work of the Tropical Research Station of the New  York Zoological Society, conducted by Mr. William Beebe, collections of  insects, including bees, were made. The present report deals with a  series of bees from the Bartica District, and Mr. John Tee Van, in  forwarding them, states that \"almost all of these bees were procured  about a clump of several species of nightshades (_Solanum_), which were  flowering in thinned-out jungle.\" I give an artificial key, which will  enable one who is not a specialist in bees to separate readily each  species from the rest. It will, of course, remain necessary to compare  any species with a fuller account to make sure that it is not some form  unrepresented in the present collection. The types of the new species  and varieties from British Guiana are deposited in The American Museum  of Natural History. Species marked P. are from the Penal Settlement;  those marked K. occur at Kalacoon.          The body, or some part of it, brilliant green                   1.

The wakeful shepherd beholds  vi:3    the first faint morning beams, ere cometh the full radiance          of a risen day. So shone the pale star to the prophet-          shepherds; yet it traversed the night, and came where, in  vi:6    cradled obscurity, lay the Bethlehem babe, the human          herald of Christ, Truth, who would make plain to be-          nighted understanding the way of salvation through Christ  vi:9    Jesus, till across a night of error should dawn the morn-          ing beams and shine the guiding star of being. The Wise-          men were led to behold and to follow this daystar of  vi:12   divine Science, lighting the way to eternal harmony.            The time for thinkers has come. Truth, independent          of doctrines and time-honored systems, knocks at the  vi:15   portal of humanity. Contentment with the past and          the cold conventionality of materialism are crumbling          away. Ignorance of God is no longer the stepping-  vi:18   stone to faith. The only guarantee of obedience is a          right apprehension of Him whom to know aright is          Life eternal. Though empires fall, \"the Lord shall  vi:21   reign forever.\"            A book introduces new thoughts, but it cannot make          them speedily understood. It is the task of the sturdy  vi:24   pioneer to hew the tall oak and to cut the rough          granite. Future ages must declare what the pioneer          has accomplished.    vi:27   Since the author's discovery of the might of Truth in  vii:1   the treatment of disease as well as of sin, her system has          been fully tested and has not been found wanting; but  vii:3   to reach the heights of Christian Science, man must live          in obedience to its divine Principle. To develop the full          might of this Science, the discords of corporeal sense  vii:6   must yield to the harmony of spiritual sense, even as the          science of music corrects false tones and gives sweet con-          cord to sound.    vii:9   Theology and physics teach that both Spirit and          matter are real and good, whereas the fact is that          Spirit is good and real, and matter is Spirit's oppo-  vii:12  site. The question, What is Truth, is answered by          demonstration, by healing both disease and sin; and          this demonstration shows that Christian healing con-  vii:15  fers the most health and makes the best men. On this          basis Christian Science will have a fair fight. Sickness          has been combated for centuries by doctors using ma-  vii:18  terial remedies; but the question arises, Is there less          sickness because of these practitioners? A vigorous          \"No\" is the response deducible from two connate  vii:21  facts, - the reputed longevity of the Antediluvians,          and the rapid multiplication and increased violence of          diseases since the flood.    vii:24  In the author's work, RETROSPECTION AND INTROSPEC-          TION, may be found a biographical sketch, narrating          experiences which led her, in the year 1866, to the dis-  vii:27  covery of the system that she denominated Christian          Science. As early as 1862 she began to write down and          give to friends the results of her Scriptural study, for  vii:30  the Bible was her sole teacher; but these compositions          were crude, the first steps of a child in the newly dis-          covered world of Spirit.    ix:1    She also began to jot down her thoughts on the          main subject, but these jottings were only infantile  ix:3    lispings of Truth. A child drinks in the outward world          through the eyes and rejoices in the draught. He is          as sure of the world's existence as he is of his own; yet  ix:6    he cannot describe the world. He finds a few words,          and with these he stammeringly attempts to convey his          feeling. Later, the tongue voices the more definite  ix:9    thought, though still imperfectly.            So was it with the author. As a certain poet says of          himself, she \"lisped in numbers, for the numbers  ix:12   came.\" Certain essays written at that early date are          still in circulation among her first pupils; but they are          feeble attempts to state the Principle and practice of  ix:15   Christian healing, and are not complete nor satisfac-          tory expositions of Truth. To-day, though rejoicing          in some progress, she still finds herself a willing dis-  ix:18   ciple at the heavenly gate, waiting for the Mind of          Christ.            Her first pamphlet on Christian Science was copy-  ix:21   righted in 1870; but it did not appear in print until          1876, as she had learned that this Science must be          1876, as she had learned that this Science must be          demonstrated by healing, before a work on the subject  ix:24   could be profitably studied. From 1867 until 1875,          copies were, however, in friendly circulation.            Before writing this work, SCIENCE AND HEALTH, she  ix:27   made copious notes of Scriptural exposition, which          have never been published. This was during the years          1867 and 1868. These efforts show her comparative  ix:30   ignorance of the stupendous Life-problem up to that          time, and the degrees by which she came at length          to its solution; but she values them as a parent  x:1     may treasure the memorials of a child's growth, and          she would not have them changed.    x:3     The first edition of SCIENCE AND HEALTH was pub-          lished in 1875. Various books on mental healing have          since been issued, most of them incorrect in theory  x:6     and filled with plagiarisms from SCIENCE AND HEALTH.          They regard the human mind as a healing agent,          whereas this mind is not a factor in the Principle of  x:9     Christian Science. A few books, however, which are          based on this book, are useful.            The author has not compromised conscience to suit  x:12    the general drift of thought, but has bluntly and hon-          estly given the text of Truth. She has made no effort          to embellish, elaborate, or treat in full detail so in-  x:15    finite a theme. By thousands of well-authenticated          cases of healing, she and her students have proved the          worth of her teachings. These cases for the most part  x:18    have been abandoned as hopeless by regular medical          attendants. Few invalids will turn to God till all          physical supports have failed, because there is so little  x:21    faith in His disposition and power to heal disease.            The divine Principle of healing is proved in the          personal experience of any sincere seeker of Truth. Its  x:24    purpose is good, and its practice is safer and more po-          tent than that of any other sanitary method. The un-          biased Christian thought is soonest touched by Truth,  x:27    and convinced of it. Only those quarrel with her          method who do not understand her meaning, or dis-          cerning the truth, come not to the light lest their  x:30    works be reproved. No intellectual proficiency is req-          uisite in the learner, but sound morals are most de-          sirable.    xi:1    Many imagine that the phenomena of physical heal-          ing in Christian Science present only a phase of the  xi:3    action of the human mind, which action in some unex-          plained way results in the cure of disease. On the con-          trary, Christian Science rationally explains that all  xi:6    other pathological methods are the fruits of human          faith in matter, faith in the workings, not of Spirit,          but of the fleshly mind which must yield to Science.    xi:9    The physical healing of Christian Science results          now, as in Jesus' time, from the operation of divine          Principle, before which sin and disease lose their real-  xi:12   ity in human consciousness and disappear as naturally          and as necessarily as darkness gives place to light and          sin to reformation. Now, as then, these mighty works  xi:15   are not supernatural, but supremely natural. They are          the sign of Immanuel, or \"God with us,\" a divine          influence ever present in human consciousness and re-  xi:18   peating itself, coming now as was promised aforetime,                 To preach deliverance to the captives [of sense],               And recovering of sight to the blind,  xi:21        To set at liberty them that are bruised.            When God called the author to proclaim His Gospel          to this age, there came also the charge to plant and  xi:24   water His vineyard.            The first school of Christian Science Mind-healing          was started by the author"]]]
