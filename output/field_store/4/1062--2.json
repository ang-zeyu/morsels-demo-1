In these series, the Museum publishes original articles and monographs  dealing with the collections and work of its constituent museums--The  Museum of Natural History and the Museum of History and  Technology--setting forth newly acquired facts in the fields of  anthropology, biology, history, geology, and technology. Copies of each  publication are distributed to libraries, to cultural and scientific  organizations, and to specialists and others interested in the different  subjects.    The _Proceedings_, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in  separate form, of shorter papers from the Museum of Natural History.  These are gathered in volumes, octavo in size, with the publication date  of each paper recorded in the table of contents of the volume.    In the _Bulletin_ series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appear  longer, separate publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in  several parts) and volumes in which are collected works on related  subjects. _Bulletins_ are either octavo or quarto in size, depending on  the needs of the presentation. Since 1902 papers relating to the  botanical collections of the Museum of Natural History have been  published in the _Bulletin_ series under the heading _Contributions from  the United States National Herbarium_ and, since 1959, in _Bulletins_  titled \"Contributions from the Museum of History and Technology,\" have  been gathered shorter papers relating to the collections and research of  that Museum.    This work forms volume 254 of the _Bulletin_ series.      Frank A.

It was not  operated electronically or jet-propelled. But to many 19th-century  people the sewing machine was probably as awe-inspiring as a space  capsule is to their 20th-century descendants. It was expensive, but,  considering the work it could do and the time it could save, the cost  was more than justified. The sewing machine became the first widely  advertised consumer appliance, pioneered installment buying and patent  pooling, and revolutionized the ready-made clothing industry. It also  weathered the protests of those who feared the new machine was a threat  to their livelihood.    The practical sewing machine is not the result of one man's genius, but  rather the culmination of a century of thought, work, trials, failures,  and partial successes of a long list of inventors. History is too quick  to credit one or two men for an important invention and to forget the  work that preceded and prodded each man to contribute his share. It is  no discredit to Howe to state that he _did not invent the sewing  machine_. Howe's work with the sewing machine was important, and he did  patent certain improvements, but his work was one step along the way. It  is for the reader to decide whether it was the turning point.    Since the sewing machine has been considered by some as one of the most  important inventions of 19th-century America, of equal importance to  this story of the invention is the history of the sewing machine's  development into a practical, popular commodity. Since many new  companies blossomed overnight to manufacture this very salable item, a  catalog list of more than one hundred and fifty of these 19th-century  companies is included in this study. Still, the list is probably  incomplete. Many of the companies remained in business a very short time  or kept their activities a secret to avoid payment of royalties to  patent holders. Evidence of these companies is difficult to find. It is  hoped that additional information will come to light as a result of  this initial attempt to list and date known companies. The dating of  individual machines based on their serial numbers is also a difficult  task. Individual company records of this type have not survived;  however, using the commercial machines in the patent collection, for  which we know one limiting date--the date the machine was deposited at  the patent office--and using the records that have survived, an  estimated date based on the serial number can be established for many of  the better known machines.           _Acknowledgments_         I am greatly indebted to the late Dr. Frederick Lewton, whose       interest in the history of the sewing machine initiated the       collecting of information about it for the Smithsonian       Institution's Division of Textiles archives and whose out-of-print       booklet \"A Servant in the House\" prompted the writing of this work.       I would also like to thank Mr. Bogart Thompson of the Singer       Manufacturing Company for his cooperation in arranging for the gift       of an excellent collection of 19th-century sewing machines to the       Smithsonian and for allowing me to use the Singer historical files.       Acknowledgment is also made of the cooperation extended by The       Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village for permitting me to study       their collection of old sewing machines.         _Grace Rogers Cooper_          _Chapter One_      [Illustration: Figure 1.--AFTER ALMOST A CENTURY OF ATTEMPTS TO INVENT A  MACHINE THAT WOULD SEW, the practical sewing machine evolved in the  mid-19th century.

The  thread might be of silk, flax, wool, sinew, or other fibrous material.  The needle, whether of bone, silver, bronze, steel, or some other metal,  was always the same in design--a thin shaft with a point at one end and  a hole or eye for receiving the thread at the other end. Simple as it  was, the common needle (fig. 2) with its thread-carrying eye had been an  ingenious improvement over the sharp bone, stick, or other object used  to pierce a hole through which a lacing then had to be passed.[1] In  addition to utilitarian stitching for such things as the making of  garments and household furnishings, the needle was also used for  decorative stitching, commonly called embroidery. And it was for this  purpose that the needle, the seemingly perfect tool that defied  improvement, was first altered for ease of stitching and to increase  production.    One of the forms that the needle took in the process of adaptation was  that of the fine steel hook. Called an _aguja_ in Spain, the hook was  used in making a type of lace known as _punto de aguja_. During the 17th  century after the introduction of chainstitch embroideries from India,  this hook was used to produce chainstitch designs on a net ground.[2]  The stitch and the fine hook to make it were especially adaptable to  this work. By the 18th century the hook had been reduced to needle size  and inserted into a handle, and was used to chainstitch-embroider woven  fabrics.[3] In France the hook was called a crochet and was sharpened to  a point for easy entry into the fabric (fig. 3). For stitching, the  fabric was held taut on a drum-shaped frame. The hooked needle pierced  the fabric, caught the thread from below the surface and pulled a loop  to the top. The needle reentered the fabric a stitch-length"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3268"],[0,"The Mysteries of Udolpho (#1)"],[1,"MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO    A Romance    Interspersed With Some Pieces of Poetry      By Ann Radcliffe              Fate sits on these dark battlements, and frowns,        And, as the portals open to receive me,        Her voice, in sullen echoes through the courts,        Tells of a nameless deed.          VOLUME 1          CHAPTER I            home is the resort   Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where,   Supporting and supported, polish'd friends   And dear relations mingle into bliss.*        *Thomson      On the pleasant banks of the Garonne, in the province of Gascony, stood,  in the year 1584, the chateau of Monsieur St. Aubert. From its windows  were seen the pastoral landscapes of Guienne and Gascony stretching  along the river, gay with luxuriant woods and vine, and plantations of  olives. To the south, the view was bounded by the majestic Pyrenees,  whose summits, veiled in clouds, or exhibiting awful forms, seen, and  lost again, as the partial vapours rolled along, were sometimes barren,  and gleamed through the blue tinge of air, and sometimes frowned  with forests of gloomy pine, that swept downward to their base. These  tremendous precipices were contrasted by the soft green of the pastures  and woods that hung upon their skirts; among whose flocks, and herds,  and simple cottages, the eye, after having scaled the cliffs above,  delighted to repose. To the north, and to the east, the plains of  Guienne and Languedoc were lost in the mist of distance; on the west,  Gascony was bounded by the waters of Biscay.    M. St. Aubert loved to wander, with his wife and daughter, on the margin  of the Garonne, and to listen to the music that floated on its waves. He  had known life in other forms than those of pastoral simplicity,  having mingled in the gay and in the busy scenes of the world; but the  flattering portrait of mankind, which his heart had delineated in early  youth, his experience had too sorrowfully corrected. Yet, amidst  the changing visions of life, his principles remained unshaken, his  benevolence unchilled; and he retired from the multitude 'more in PITY  than in anger,' to scenes of simple nature, to the pure delights of  literature, and to the exercise of domestic virtues.    He was a descendant from the younger branch of an illustrious family,  and it was designed, that the deficiency of his patrimonial wealth  should be supplied either by a splendid alliance in marriage, or by  success in the intrigues of public affairs. But St. Aubert had too nice  a sense of honour to fulfil the latter hope, and too small a portion  of ambition to sacrifice what he called happiness, to the attainment of  wealth. After the death of his father he married a very amiable woman,  his equal in birth, and not his superior in fortune. The late Monsieur  St. Aubert's liberality, or extravagance, had so much involved his  affairs, that his son found it necessary to dispose of a part of  the family domain, and, some years after his marriage, he sold it to  Monsieur Quesnel, the brother of his wife, and retired to a small estate  in Gascony, where conjugal felicity, and parental duties, divided his  attention with the treasures of knowledge and the illuminations of  genius.    To this spot he had been attached from his infancy. He had often made  excursions to it when a boy, and the impressions of delight given to his  mind by the homely kindness of the grey-headed peasant, to whom it  was intrusted, and whose fruit and cream never failed, had not been  obliterated by succeeding circumstances. The green pastures along  which he had so often bounded in the exultation of health, and youthful  freedom--the woods, under whose refreshing shade he had first indulged  that pensive melancholy, which afterwards made a strong feature of his  character--the wild walks of the mountains, the river, on whose waves he  had floated, and the distant plains, which seemed boundless as his early  hopes--were never after remembered by St. Aubert but with enthusiasm  and regret. At length he disengaged himself from the world, and retired  hither, to realize the wishes of many years.    The building, as it then stood, was merely a summer cottage, rendered  interesting to a stranger by its neat simplicity, or the beauty of the  surrounding scene; and considerable additions were necessary to make it  a comfortable family residence. St. Aubert felt a kind of affection for  every part of the fabric, which he remembered in his youth, and would  not suffer a stone of it to be removed, so that the new building,  adapted to the style of the old one, formed with it only a simple and  elegant residence. The taste of Madame St. Aubert was conspicuous in its  internal finishing, where the same chaste simplicity was observable  in the furniture, and in the few ornaments of the apartments, that  characterized the manners of its inhabitants.    The library occupied the west side of the chateau, and was enriched by  a collection of the best books in the ancient and modern languages. This  room opened upon a grove, which stood on the brow of a gentle declivity,  that fell towards the river, and the tall trees gave it a melancholy  and pleasing shade; while from the windows the eye caught, beneath the  spreading branches, the gay and luxuriant landscape stretching to the  west, and overlooked on the left by the bold precipices of the Pyrenees.  Adjoining the library was a green-house, stored with scarce and  beautiful plants; for one of the amusements of St. Aubert was the  study of botany, and among the neighbouring mountains, which afforded a  luxurious feast to the mind of the naturalist, he often passed the day  in the pursuit of his favourite science. He was sometimes accompanied  in these little excursions by Madame St. Aubert, and frequently by his  daughter; when, with a small osier basket to receive plants, and another  filled with cold refreshments, such as the cabin of the shepherd did  not afford, they wandered away among the most romantic and magnificent  scenes, nor suffered the charms of Nature's lowly children to abstract  them from the observance of her stupendous works. When weary of  sauntering among cliffs that seemed scarcely accessible but to the steps  of the enthusiast, and where no track appeared on the vegetation, but  what the foot of the izard had left; they would seek one of those green  recesses, which so beautifully adorn the bosom of these mountains,  where, under the shade of the lofty larch, or cedar, they enjoyed their  simple repast, made sweeter by the waters of the cool stream, that crept  along the turf, and by the breath of wild flowers and aromatic plants,  that fringed the rocks, and inlaid the grass.    Adjoining the eastern side of the green-house, looking towards the  plains of Languedoc, was a room, which Emily called hers, and which  contained her books, her drawings, her musical instruments, with some  favourite birds and plants. Here she usually exercised herself in  elegant arts, cultivated only because they were congenial to her taste,  and in which native genius, assisted by the instructions of Monsieur  and Madame St. Aubert, made her an early proficient. The windows of  this room were particularly pleasant; they descended to the floor, and,  opening upon the little lawn that surrounded the house, the eye was led  between groves of almond, palm-trees, flowering-ash, and myrtle, to the  distant landscape, where the Garonne wandered.    The peasants of this gay climate were often seen on an evening, when  the day's labour was done, dancing in groups on the margin of the river.  Their sprightly melodies, debonnaire steps, the fanciful figure of  their dances, with the tasteful and capricious manner in which the girls  adjusted their simple dress, gave a character to the scene entirely  French.    The front of the chateau, which, having a southern aspect, opened upon  the grandeur of the mountains, was occupied on the ground floor by a  rustic hall, and two excellent sitting rooms. The first floor, for the  cottage had no second story, was laid out in bed-chambers, except one  apartment that opened to a balcony, and which was generally used for a  breakfast-room.    In the surrounding ground, St. Aubert had made very tasteful  improvements; yet, such was his attachment to objects he had remembered  from his boyish days, that he had in some instances sacrificed taste  to sentiment. There were two old larches that shaded the building, and  interrupted the prospect; St. Aubert had sometimes declared that he  believed he should have been weak enough to have wept at their fall. In  addition to these larches he planted a little grove of beech, pine, and  mountain-ash. On a lofty terrace, formed by the swelling bank of the  river, rose a plantation of orange, lemon, and palm-trees, whose fruit,  in the coolness of evening, breathed delicious fragrance. With these  were mingled a few trees of other species. Here, under the ample shade  of a plane-tree, that spread its majestic canopy towards the river, St.  Aubert loved to sit in the fine evenings of summer, with his wife and  children, watching, beneath its foliage, the setting sun, the mild  splendour of its light fading from the distant landscape, till the  shadows of twilight melted its various features into one tint of sober  grey. Here, too, he loved to read, and to converse with Madame St.  Aubert; or to play with his children, resigning himself to the influence  of those sweet affections, which are ever attendant on simplicity and  nature. He has often said, while tears of pleasure trembled in his eyes,  that these were moments infinitely more delightful than any passed amid  the brilliant and tumultuous scenes that are courted by the world. His  heart was occupied; it had, what can be so rarely said, no wish for a  happiness beyond what it experienced. The consciousness of acting right  diffused a serenity over his manners, which nothing"]]]
