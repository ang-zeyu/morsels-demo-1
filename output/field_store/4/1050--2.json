RULLMAN, INC., NEW YORK, N.Y.          ARGUMENT      ACT I.    A Norwegian brig is driven out of her course on the homeward voyage, and  near the rockbound Norwegian Coast meets with the phantom ship of the  \"Flying Dutchman.\" Daland, the captain of the Norwegian vessel, enters  into a compact with the \"Flying Dutchman\" whose identity, however, is  unknown to him, to give him a home and his daughter, Senta, for a wife,  in consideration of the rich treasures stored away in the \"Flying  Dutchman's\" ship.      ACT II.    When the curtain rises, a bevy of Norwegian Girls, among whom are  Daland's daughter, Senta and her nurse Mary, are discovered turning  their spinning wheels and singing a spinning song. A picture of the  \"Flying Dutchman\" adorns the wall, and Senta, after singing a ballad  sketching in incoherent, passionate strains, a story of the subject of  the picture, solemnly vows that she will become the means of terminating  the torment, to which the \"Flying Dutchman\" is subjected, and who can  only be saved by a woman unwaveringly constant in her love. During the  confusion which ensues upon this avowal, the father's arrival is  announced. In the time intervening between this announcement and  Daland's arrival, Erik, Senta's lover, pleads for his love, and  endeavors to persuade Senta that her infatuation for a phantom lover  will lead to her irretrievable ruin; but to no avail. Daland arrives  and presents the \"Flying Dutchman\" to his daughter. Senta accepts him  as her affianced husband.      ACT III.    The curtain rises on the crew of the Norwegian brig singing a frolicking  sailor song, and jesting with a bevy of girls, who bring them  refreshments. The special object of their jest and fun (in which the  girls also join), is the crew of the \"Flying Dutchman,\" whom they cannot  persuade to join in their merry-making. They finally conclude that the  crew of the neighboring ship must be dead, and the suspicion gains  belief that the \"Flying Dutchman\" is playing one of his ugly tricks.  The crew of the \"Flying Dutchman\" sing a fantastic song to which the  Norwegian sailors intently listen, and whose weird words they finally  endeavor to drown in a song of their own. Erik pleads again with Senta,  and the \"Flying Dutchman\" appears on the scene, and orders his crew to  prepare for immediate departure, thinking Senta had proven as faithless  and inconstant in the love she had vowed him, as the rest of womankind  he had come in contact with. Senta, however, vows that she will be true  to him, and even after the \"Flying Dutchman\" discloses his identity, she  does not falter in her resolution. \"Thine will I be, until death shall  us part!\" she passionately exclaims and the curtain falls.

So nah' dem Ziel nach langer Fahrt,    War mir der Streich noch aufgespart!          DALAND.          No doubt! Full seven miles away        Drove us the storm at break of day        So near the port, and to be met        By adverse wind--'tis 'nough to fret!      STEUERMANN.      Ho! Capitän!          MATE.          Ho! Captain!      DALAND.      Am Bord bei Euch, wie steht's?          DALAND.          On deck I am with you. How do things progress?      STEUERMANN.      Gut, Capitän! Wir sind auf sicherm Grund.          MATE.          Well, captain, we are in home waters.      DALAND.      's ist Sandwyk-Strand, genau kenn' ich die Bucht. --    Verwünscht! schon sah am Ufer ich mein Haus,    Senta, mein Kind, glaubt' ich schon zu umarmen.    Da bläst er aus dem Teufels-Loch heraus. . . .    Wer baut auf Wind, baut auf Satans Erbarmen!    Was hilft's? der Sturm lässt nach, --    Wenn so er tobte, währt's nicht lang.    He! Bursche! lange war't ihr wach;    Zur Ruhe denn, mir ist's nicht bang!    Nun, Steuermann! die Wache nimmst Du wohl für mich?    Gefahr ist nicht, doch gut ist's, wenn Du wachst.          DALAND.          'Tis Sandwyk beach, full well know I the bay.        Confound the luck! I saw my house; a welcome sight!        Senta, my child, I fancied in my arms I held,        When of a sudden changeth the wind,        And blew a gale, as if in league with Satan's power;        But now the worst is past, and its fury        The storm hath spent in fitful blasts.        Well, boys, you've had to work with giant power,        And you may rest, now that past the danger;        And you, mate, you may take the watch for me;        There's no danger now, still keep a sharp look-out!      STEUERMANN.      Seid ausser Sorg'! Schlaft ruhig, Capitän!          MATE.          Rely on me! Good night, captain.      STEUERMANN.      Mit Gewitter und Sturm aus fernem Meer --    Mein Mädel, bin dir nah'.    Über thurmhohe Fluth vom Süden her --    Mein Mädel, ich bin da!    Mein Mädel, wenn nicht Südwind wär',    Ich nimmer wohl käm' zu Dir; --    Ach, lieber Südwind! blas' noch mehr,    Mein Mädel verlangt nach mir!    Hohohe! Jolohe! Hoho! Ho! Ho! etc.    Von des Südens Gestad', aus weitem Land' --    Ich hab' an Dich gedacht;    Durch Gewitter und Meer vom Mohrenstrand    Hab' ich Dir was mitgebracht.    Mein Mädel, preis' den Südwind hoch.    Ich bring' Dir ein gülden Band; --    Ach, lieber Südwind, blase doch!    Mein Mädel hätt' gern den Tand.    Hoho! Ho jolohe! etc.          MATE.          In tempest's roar, on the wide sea,        My girl, I think of thee!        The gale, ah, well! it came from the South,        Lucky for thee and me!        My girl, if it hadn't Southwind been,        I wouldn't see thee again!        Ah! come and blow, my Southwind fair,        Else waits my love in vain.        Hohohe! Jolohe! Heigho! heigho! heigho        On Southland's coast, in far off land,        My girl, I thought of thee!        All o'er the main, from tropic coast,        A gift I brought for thee;        My love I bring a golden toy--        Come, Southwind, blow again!        Southwind, thou art a lovely boy,        If thou wilt blow again.        Hoho! ho! jolohe! heigho!        ZWEITE SCENE.          SCENE II.      HOLLAENDER.      Die Frist ist um, und abermals verstrichen    Sind sieben Jahr! -- Voll Überdruss wirft mich    Das Meer an's Land. . . Ha, stolzer Ocean!    In kurzer Frist sollst du mich wieder tragen!    Dein Trotz ist beugsam -- doch ewig meine Qual.    Das Heil, das auf dem Land ich suche, nimmer    Werd' ich es finden! Euch, des Weltmeers Fluthen,    Bleib' ich getreu, bis eure letzte Welle    Sich bricht und euer letztes Nass versiegt!    Wie oft in Meeres tiefsten Schlund    Stürzt' ich voll Sehnsucht mich hinab,    Doch ach! den Tod, ich fand ihn nicht!    Da, wo der Schiffe furchtbar Grab,    Trieb _mein_ Schiff ich zum Klippengrund,    Doch ach! mein Grab, es schloss sich nicht!    Verhöhnend droht' ich dem Piraten,    Im wilden Kampfe hofft' ich Tod: --          THE FLYING DUTCHMAN.          The time is up, and to Eternity's tomb consign'd        Another seven years! Disgusted is the main,        And throws me on the strand. Ah! sea so proud,        Thy waves, ere many days are past, I'll ride again.        What of thy scorn with my torment in the balance weigh'd?        The rest which on land I seek, oh! never        Shall I find; for to the ocean waves        My destiny is bound, until the last wave        Ceases to flow, and evaporates into air.        How often into deepest abyss of the sea        Have I thrown my ship and hapless me;        But, alas! the death I sought I never found.        Where yawns the grave for ship and sailor,        I drove my ship to craggy rock,        But not was watery grave my lot.        Where sails the pirate's dreaded craft,        Have oft I waited for bloody strife;      »Hier -"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31987"],[0,"Territory in Bird Life (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net                  +-------------------------------------------------------+    |  TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:                                  |    |                                                       |    |  There are a large number of compound words in        |    |  this book including bird names which occur joined,   |    |  spaced and hyphenated.

ELIOT HOWARD        WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY    G. E. LODGE AND H. GROeNVOLD        NEW YORK    E. P. DUTTON AND COMPANY    1920          PREFACE      When studying the Warblers some twenty years ago, I became aware of the  fact that each male isolates itself at the commencement of the breeding  season and exercises dominion over a restricted area of ground. Further  investigation, pursued with a view to ascertaining the relation of this  particular mode of behaviour to the system of reproduction, led to my  studying various species, not only those of close affinity, but those  widely remote in the tree of avian life. The present work is the outcome  of those investigations. In it I have endeavoured to interpret the  prospective value of the behaviour, and to trace out the relationships  in the organic and inorganic world which have determined its survival.  Much is mere speculation; much with fuller knowledge may be found to be  wrong. But I venture to hope that a nucleus will remain upon which a  more complete territorial system may one day be established.    I have to thank Mr. G. E. Lodge and Mr. H. Groenvold for the trouble they  have taken in executing my wishes; I also want to record my indebtedness  to the late E. W. Hopewell; and to Professor Lloyd Morgan, F.R.S., I am  beholden more than I can tell.
