PREFACE      These few pages are intended to serve a twofold purpose,--to give the  student a general outline of Blowpipe Analysis, and to introduce him to  the methods of Determinative Mineralogy.    Every effort has been made to simplify details so that the book may be  used in both High Schools and Colleges.    Tables for \"systematic\" examination have been intentionally omitted, for  in the author's estimation these tend to dull the student's power of  observation, and to make him place little value upon minute details.    The alphabetic arrangement has been followed for the sake of convenience  when referring to the book.    The last chapter is not intended to serve as a key to determining the  minerals therein described, but rather it is added to give the student  exercise in Blowpipe Analysis, and at the same time to point out the  _methods_ of Determinative Mineralogy.    Finally, the author would acknowledge his indebtedness to the following  works: \"Manual of Qualitative Analysis,\" Fresenius; \"Qualitative  Chemical Analysis,\" Venable; Roscoe and Schorlemmer's \"Treatise on  Chemistry\"; Foye's \"Hand-Book of Mineralogy\"; Dana's \"Mineralogy\";  Kobell's \"Tafeln zur Bestimmung der Mineralien\"; etc.    FREDERICK HUTTON GETMAN.

One of the best and least expensive forms of  blowpipe is shown in Fig. 1. This consists, as is seen from the  illustration, of a conical-shaped tube of tin closed at the wide end and  formed into a mouthpiece at the small end; soldered into the tube at the  large end, and at right angles to its axis, is a small brass tube which  terminates in a conical tip pierced with a very fine hole. With this  pipe it is possible to perform all of the operations of mineral  analysis.    Some little practice is necessary to keep the flame steady and to take  the breath at the same time.    No rule can well be given to the beginner, but his experience becomes  his best guide.      ~Bunsen Flame.~--Any kind of flame can be used for the blowpipe, provided  it be not too small; but since almost every laboratory to-day is  furnished with gas and the Bunsen burner (Fig. 2), it will only be  necessary to describe the use of the flame from this source. Upon  examining the Bunsen flame with care, it will be seen that the flame  consists of three distinct parts.    A dark inner cone which consists of gas not yet raised to the ignition  point. Beyond this there is a luminous cone, where combustion is  incomplete owing to lack of oxygen, and outside of this we find the  non-luminous cone where the gas is completely burned.    This outer envelope is the hottest portion of the flame, and is known as  the \"oxidizing\" flame because there is an excess of oxygen which is  imparted to substances placed therein.    The luminous cone is known as the \"reducing\" flame, for in it metallic  oxides are reduced, the oxygen being taken up by the small incandescent  particles of carbon.    If the air-holes at the base of the Bunsen burner be opened, the two  inner cones become elongated, and the flame appears almost colorless.    The blowpipe enables us to get an oxidizing and a reducing flame of  better form and greater power. To do this we cut off the air supply at  the base of the burner and turn off the gas until the flame is about 1  cm. high; then upon introducing the blowpipe, and blowing a strong  continuous jet of air across the Bunsen flame, we produce an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],[0,"Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                                              STUDENT'S HAND-BOOK                                     OF                            MUSHROOMS OF AMERICA                             EDIBLE AND POISONOUS.

In the year 1876, as Microscopist of the Department of Agriculture, I  prepared, as a part of the exhibit of my Division at the Centennial  Exhibition at Philadelphia, a large collection of water-color drawings  representing leading types of the edible and poisonous mushrooms of the  United States, together with representations of about nine hundred  species of microscopic fungi detrimental to vegetation.    In the preparation of the first collection I had the valuable assistance  of Prof. Charles H. Peck, State Botanist of New York, and in the second  the hearty co-operation of Rev. M. J. Berkeley and Dr. M. C. Cook, the  eminent British mycologists.    The popular character of this exhibit attracted the attention of the  general public, and many letters were received at the Department showing  an awakening interest in the study of fungi, particularly with regard to  the mushroom family, as to methods of cultivation, the means of  determining the good from the unwholesome varieties, etc.    My first published paper on the subject of edible mushrooms, entitled  \"Twelve Edible Mushrooms of the U. S.,\" appeared in the annual report of  the Department of Agriculture for 1885. This was followed by others to  the number of five, and as the demand for these reports increased,  reprints were made and issued, by order of the Secretary of Agriculture,  in pamphlet form, under the general title of \"Food Products.\" Numerous  editions of these reprints were issued by the Department up to 1894.  During the year 1894, and the first half of 1895, 36,600 of these  reports were sent out by the Department, and the supply was exhausted.  They have been out of print for more than two years. It is in view of  this fact, and in response to a great and constant demand for these  publications, that I have undertaken to publish a series of five  pamphlets on the edible and poisonous mushrooms of the United States,  which shall embody the substance of the five pamphlets on \"Food  Products\" above alluded to, supplemented by new matter relating to  classification, general and specific, analytical tables of standard  authors, and a continuation of the chapters on structure, etc.  Additional plates, representing leading types of edible and poisonous  mushrooms, will also be inserted in each number.    In the compilation and extension of this work I have the assistance of  my daughter, Miss A. Robena Taylor, who has given considerable attention  to the study of fungi, and who has been my faithful coadjutor in the  work of collecting specimens, etc., for a number of years.    For valuable suggestions as to structural characteristics and methods of  classification I am especially indebted to Prof. Chas. H. Peck, of  Albany, New York, Dr. M. C. Cooke, of England, and Prof. P. A. Saccardo,  of Italy.    The colored plates in pamphlet No. 1, together with a few of those which  will appear in the succeeding numbers of this series, are reproductions  of those prepared, under my direct supervision, for the pamphlets  entitled \"Food Products\" published by the Department of Agriculture and  referred to above.                                            THOMAS TAYLOR, M. D.    May 7, 1897.          CRYPTOGAMS.      The cryptogamic or flowerless plants, _i. e._, those having neither  stamens nor pistils, and which are propagated by spores, are divided,  according to Dr. Hooper, into the following four classes:--Pteridophyta  or vascular acrogens, represented by the ferns, club-mosses, etc.;  Bryophyta or cellular acrogens, represented by the musci, scale-mosses,  etc.; Algae, represented by the \"Red Seaweeds,\" Diatomacae, etc.; Fungi or  Amphigens, which include the molds, mildews, mushrooms, etc. The  lichens, according to the \"Schwendener Hypotheses,\" consist of  ascigerous fungi parasitic on algae.      FUNGI.    Botanists unite in describing the plants of this class as being  destitute of chlorophyll and of starch. These plants assume an infinite  variety of forms, and are propagated by spores which are individually so  minute as to be scarcely perceptible to the naked eye. They are entirely  cellular, and belong to the class Amphigens, which for the most part  have no determinate axe, and develop in every direction, in  contradistinction to the Acrogens, which develop from the summit,  possessing an axe, leaves, vessels, etc.    Fungi are divided by systematists into two great classes:    1. Sporifera, in which the spores are free, naked, or soon exposed.    2. Sporidifera, in which the spores are not exposed, but instead are  enclosed in minute cells or sacs, called asci.    These classes are again subdivided, according to the disposition of the  spores and of the spore bearing surface, called the hymenium, into  various families.    The sporiferous fungi are arranged into four families, viz:    1. _Hymenomycetes_, in which the hymenium is free, mostly naked, or soon  exposed. _Example, \"Common Meadow Mushroom.\"_    2. _Gasteromycetes_, in which the hymenium is enclosed in a second case  or wrapper, called a peridium, which ruptures when mature, thus  releasing the spores. _Example, Common Puff Ball._    3. _Coniomycetes_, in which the spores are naked, mostly terminal on  inconspicuous threads, free or enclosed in a perithecium. Dust-like  fungi. _Example, Rust of Wheat._    4. _Hyphomycetes_, in which the spores are naked on conspicuous threads,  rarely compacted, Thread-like fungi. _Example, Blue Mold._    Of these four subdivisions of the Sporifera, only the Hymenomycetes and  the Gasteromycetes contain plants of the mushroom family, and these two  together constitute the class known as the Basidiomycetes. The chief  distinction of the Basidiomycetes is that the naked spores are borne on  the summits of certain supporting bodies, termed basidia. These basides  are swollen, club-shaped cells, surmounted by four minute tubes or  spore-bearers, called sterigmata, each of which carries a spore. See  Figs. 3 and 4, Plate A.    These basides together with a series of elongated cells, termed  paraphyses, packed closely together side by side, and intermixed with  other sterile cells, called cystidia, constitute the spore-bearing  surface or hymenium of the plant.    To the naked eye this hymenium appears simply as a very thin smooth  membrane, but when a small portion of it is viewed through a microscope  with high powers its complex structure is readily observed and can be  carefully studied.    The _Sporidiferous_ fungi are represented by the families Physomycetes  and Ascomycetes. The first of these consists wholly of microscopic  fungi.    _Ascomycetes._--In the plants of this family the spores are not  supported upon basidia, but instead are enclosed in minute sacs or asci  formed from the fertile cells of a hymenium. In this connection it would  be well to state that Saccardo does not recognize the divisions  _Sporifera_ and _Sporidifera_ by those names.    They are nearly the equivalent of Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes.    What Cooke names Physomycetes, Saccardo calls Phycomyceteae, introducing  it in his work between Gasteromyceteae and Myxomyceteae, which some  mycologists consider somewhat out of place.    Saccardo calls its asci (sacs which contain the spores) sporangia. He  does not regard them as genuine asci, but as corresponding more to the  peridium of the _Gasteromyceteae_ and _Myxomyceteae._    Peck says that this group seems to present characters of both  Hyphomycetes and Ascomycetes, with a preponderance towards Hyphomycetes.    It is a small group, however, and since it consists wholly of  microscopic fungi, need not be farther considered in this work.    In the Ascomycetes are included the sub-families Discomycetes,  Pyrenomycetes, and Tuberacei. Of these the Discomycetes and the  Tuberacei are the only groups which"]]]
