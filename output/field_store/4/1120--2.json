The primary objectives of my study were to determine the present  mammalian fauna of the San Gabriel Mountains, to ascertain the  geographic and ecologic range of each species, and to determine the  systematic status of the mammals. In addition, certain life history  observations have been recorded.    Field work was done in the north-south cross section of the mountains  from San Gabriel Canyon on the west, to Cajon Wash on the east; and from  the gently sloping alluvium at the Pacific base of the mountains at  roughly 1000 feet elevation on the south, over the crest of the range to  the border of the Mojave Desert at an elevation of 3500 feet on the  north. Camps were established at many points in the area with the object  of collecting the mammals of each association and each habitat. Field  work was begun in the San Gabriels in November 1948, and was carried  on intermittently until March 1952. I was unable to carry on field work  in any summer.        For advice and assistance in various ways I am grateful to Drs.      Willis E. Pequegnat, Walter P. Taylor, Henry S. Fitch, E.      Raymond Hall, Mr. Steven M. Jacobs and my wife, Hazel A.      Vaughan.        More than 350 mammals were prepared as study specimens; most of      these are in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History.      Approximately a fifth of them are in the collection of the      Department of Zoology at Pomona College, and a few are in the      University of Illinois Museum of Natural History. No symbol is      used to designate specimens in the University of Kansas Museum      of Natural History. Specimens from the Department of Zoology of      Pomona College and the University of Illinois Museum of Natural      History are designated by PC and IM, respectively.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map of the San Gabriel Mountain area showing the  positions of places mentioned in the text.]          DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA      The San Gabriel Mountains are approximately sixty-six miles long, and  average twenty miles wide. The main axis of the range trends nearly east  and west, and extends from longitude 117 deg.25' to longitude 118 deg.30'. The  widest part of the range is bounded by latitude 34 deg.7' and latitude  34 deg.30'.    The San Gabriel Mountains connect the Sierra Nevada with the Peninsular  Ranges of southern California and Baja California. On the west the San  Gabriels are bordered by the Tehachapi Mountains, which stretch  northeastward to meet the southern Sierra Nevada; to the east, beyond  Cajon Pass, the San Bernardino Mountains extend eastward and then curve  southward to the broad San Gorgonio Pass, from which the San Jacinto  Range stretches southeastward to merge with the Peninsular Ranges.    The rocks comprising the major part of the San Gabriel Mountains  probably were intruded in Late Jurassic times, with severe metamorphic  activity taking place concurrently. A long period of erosion followed  after which deposition took place during much of the Tertiary.  Deformation and uplift beginning in Middle Miocene times resulted in the  formation of east-west-trending faults along both sides of the range. By  repeated movements along these faults the Late Jurassic crystalline  rocks were lifted above late Tertiary and Quaternary sediments and  elevated above the surrounding terrain. Continued uplifts in  post-Pleistocene time together with erosion in Recent times have shaped  the San Gabriel Mountains (Oakeshott, 1937).    The alluvial slopes at the coastal base of the range give way to the  foothills at roughly 1800 feet elevation; whereas the Mojave Desert  merges with the interior foothills at elevations near 4000 feet. The  crest or drainage-divide of the range varies from 6000 to 8000 feet in  elevation, and many peaks are more than 8000 feet high. San Antonio  Peak, the highest peak of the range, rises to an altitude of 10,080  feet. The mountains are characteristically steep and the slopes are  deeply carved by canyons, the larger of which have permanent streams.  The abruptness of the Pacific slope is in many places impressive. The  horizontal distance from the top of Cucamonga Peak, at an elevation of  8911 feet, to the base of the coastal foothills directly to the south,  at 2250 feet, an elevational difference of 6661 feet, is only 3.8 miles.  From the base of Evey Canyon, at 2250 feet, to an unnamed peak to the  northwest with an elevation of 5420 feet, the horizontal distance is 2.1  miles. Because of the steep, rocky nature of many of the slopes and the  lack of soil on them, vegetation may be sparse even at high elevations.  There are few meadows in the mountains.    Because the San Gabriels stand approximately thirty miles from the  Pacific Ocean and are a partial barrier to Pacific air masses sweeping  inland, the desert side and the coastal side of the range differ  climatically. The coastal slope receives much heavier precipitation than  the desert slope. The precipitation, for 1951, of 25.36 inches recorded  at the mouth of San Antonio Canyon on the Pacific slope contrasts with  7.17 inches recorded at Valyermo at the desert base. Nearly all of the  precipitation comes in winter. The higher parts of the range, above  approximately 5000 feet, receive much of their mid-winter precipitation  in the form of snow. Snow often extends down the desert slope well into  the Joshua Tree belt. When there are heavy winter rains the channels of  the usually dry washes are filled with rushing, turbid water. There are  striking differences in temperature between the two sides of the range  and between the lower elevations of the mountains and the higher parts.  For example, in December 1951, the mean temperature at the base of San  Antonio Canyon (2225 feet) at the coastal foot of the range was 55.4 deg.F,  while at Llano (3764 feet) at the desert base it was 43.7 deg.F. In this  same year the December mean for Table Mountain (7500 feet), on the  desert slope, was 33.4 deg.F. The temperature means for July, 1951, at San  Antonio Canyon, Llano, and Table Mountain, were 77.3 deg.F, 82.1 deg.F, and  69.2 deg.F respectively. The weather records for 1951 were used for  illustration because average temperature and average precipitation for  many other years are lacking for most of the weather stations in the  area. There is an important difference in the humidity on the two sides  of the range, but actual data are not available. At certain times,  especially in spring, fog banks moving in from the Pacific Ocean  frequently blanket the coastal base of the mountains and the foothills.  On such days the fog generally \"burns off\" in the morning, but may  persist into the afternoon or throughout the day. Never in my experience  has fog spilled over the main part of the range far onto the desert  slope, although the fog may push through the lower passes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net                    [Illustration: _From Photograph by the Author_      THE MYSTIC CENTRE OF THE CELTIC WORLD    CARNAC IN A.
