KNOX JONES, JR.      In the past several years the United States National Museum has received  a large number of mammals from central and southern Korea through the  auspices of the Commission on Hemorrhagic Fever of the Armed Forces  Epidemiological Board. Among these Korean collections are more than a  hundred specimens of a murine rodent originally described as \"_Micromys  speciosus peninsulae_\" by Oldfield Thomas but currently placed in the  genus _Apodemus_. In attempting to ascertain the specific relationships  of this mouse I have examined, through the generosity of Dr. David H.  Johnson, Acting Curator of Mammals, most of the other Oriental specimens  of the subgenus _Sylvaemus_ in the U. S. National Museum and it is on  this combined material that the following comments and description are  based.    Three general groups of the genus _Apodemus_ are presently known to  occur on the mainland of northeast Asia. One is the distinctive  _Apodemus agrarius_, lone representative of the subgenus _Apodemus_. The  others, both in the subgenus _Sylvaemus_ and closely resembling each  other, are represented by a small animal that is currently regarded as  conspecific with _Apodemus sylvaticus_ and a larger animal of which the  Korean mouse, _peninsulae_, is representative. The oldest trivial name  applied to the large _Sylvaemus_ is _major_ of Radde, 1862, in the  combination [_Mus sylvaticus_] vrt. _major_. This is, however, twice  preoccupied (see Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:566). The next  available name is _peninsulae_ of Thomas, 1907, which was applied to  mice from central and southern Korea (type from Mun'gyong, 110 mi. SE  Seoul, Korea), and was originally proposed as a subspecies of the  insular Japanese species, _Apodemus speciosus_. G. M. Allen (1940:949),  who recognized _peninsulae_ as a monotypic species, was the first  investigator to make the important distinction that it was not  conspecific with the Japanese _speciosus_, although Hollister (1913:1-2)  and Miller (1914:89) had previously used the combination _Apodemus  peninsulae_, evidently with the same thought in mind.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.

In comparing the ventral views of skulls note especially the size and  location of incisive foramina and posterior palatine foramina as well as  the breadth of mesopterygoid fossae. In comparing the left maxillary  tooth-rows note especially the size of M3 and the reduced  posterointernal cusp on Ml in _A. peninsulae_.]    More recently, Ellerman (1949:32) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott  (1951:566) have arranged _peninsulae_ as a subspecies of _Apodemus  flavicollis_ under the assumption that all the members of the subgenus  _Sylvaemus_ on the eastern Asiatic mainland are subspecies of one or  another of the species of western Europe, _A. flavicollis_ or _A.  sylvaticus_. Ellerman (in Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:564) states:  \"The majority of the forms I distribute in a somewhat arbitrary manner  between _sylvaticus_, average smaller skull, and _flavicollis_, average  larger skull; occurring together nearly throughout the Palaearctic. I  feel fairly sure that there are some errors of judgment in my  arrangement, and equally sure that there is no other way to define  species in this very large and difficult group.\" I have compared the  specimens of _peninsulae_ available to me from central and southern  Korea with specimens of _A. f. flavicollis_ from Denmark, Germany and  Sweden and find, although the two are similar in many ways, that  _peninsulae_ differs from _flavicollis_ in several important characters:  Mammae 1-2=6 in _flavicollis_, and 2-2=8 in _peninsulae_; incisive  foramina reaching level of alveoli of M1, or nearly so, in  _flavicollis_, but ending conspicuously short of that level in  _peninsulae_; posterior palatine foramina large in _flavicollis_ and  opposite a point where M1 and M2 meet, but small in _peninsulae_ and  situated farther back on the palate, opposite M2. Moreover, _peninsulae_  lacks the characteristic buffy throat patch of _flavicollis_, has a much  reduced posterointernal cusp on the M1, a relatively (frequently  actually) larger M3 and, on the average, a broader mesopterygoid fossa.  In view of these differences, all of which appear to be constant, I  consider _peninsulae_ specifically distinct from _flavicollis_.  Throughout its known geographic range (see below) _peninsulae_ is  evidently confined to wooded terrain, either scrub or brush types or  forested areas, and the vernacular name wood mouse, therefore, seems  appropriate for this species.    The type specimens of _Apodemus praetor_ Miller (type from Sungari  River, 60 mi. SW Kirin, Manchuria) and _Apodemus nigritalus_ Hollister  (type from Tapucha, Altai Mountains, Siberia) agree with _peninsulae_ as  concerns the above characters and differ from it only in minor external  and cranial features. They are, therefore, here considered as subspecies  of the latter.    Ellerman (1949:32) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951:567) regarded  _nigritalus_, like _peninsulae_, as a subspecies of _flavicollis_. The  subspecies _praetor_, on the other hand, has generally been regarded as  a synonym of _peninsulae_ by recent authors. Howell (1929:58) noted that  the holotype was, \"... a phenomenally large specimen such as is  encountered occasionally in almost all groups of rodents.\" He ascribed  the color differences noted by Miller to \"seasonal\" variation. The  holotype of _praetor_ is undeniably larger than the other adult  specimens listed in the original description. These paratypes and other  specimens of _praetor_ available to me are approximately the same size  externally and average only slightly larger cranially than specimens of  _peninsulae_ from central and southern Korea. However, the dorsal  coloration of _praetor_ is somewhat darker and duller than that of  _peninsulae_, especially in summer pelage when _praetor_ lacks the  conspicuous bright ochraceous tinge of the Korean specimens. In  addition, _praetor_ has broader zygomatic plates with correspondingly  deeper zygomatic notches and the color on the face of the upper incisors  averages much more orange than in _peninsulae_.    In the north then, wood mice range from Korea and Manchuria westward at  least as far as the Altai Mountains. For mice from the intervening  Siberian areas Russian workers have used the name _major_ which, as  noted above, is unavailable. The exact relationships of the mice of  these areas to previously named subspecies is unknown to me and I have  not seen specimens of \"_Mus (Alsomys) major rufulus_\" of Dukelsky, 1928,  the type locality of which is 75 versts (approximately 50 miles) SE  Vladivostok, Siberia. It appears to be of the same species as  _peninsulae_ and judging from the original description it closely  resembles _praetor_. Neither have I seen specimens of the Sakhalin  Island mouse, _giliacus_, which Ellerman (1949:32) regards as a  subspecies of _Apodemus sylvaticus_. I feel reasonably sure, however,  that it will prove to be a subspecies of _peninsulae_. In the original  description _giliacus_ was referred to as, \"Most closely allied to the  Korean subspecies...\" (Thomas, 1907:411).    In China the extent of the distribution of _Apodemus peninsulae_ is also  uncertain. Allen (1940:949-50) reported its occurrence from Jehol and  Hopeh in the northeast, southwestward through Shansi, Shensi and eastern  Kansu to Szechuan and northwestern Yunnan. Throughout most of this  region it occurs with another mouse, currently regarded as conspecific  with _Apodemus sylvaticus_, and the two kinds have been confused by some  previous authors. Howell (1929:58), for instance, reported twelve  specimens of _peninsulae_ from 65-75 mi. NE Peking but my examination of  these mice indicates that only four are _peninsulae_ while the others  are referrable to what is currently regarded as _Apodemus sylvaticus  draco_. Another subspecies of _sylvaticus_, _A. s. orestes_, occurs in  Szechuan and Yunnan and it is certain that some records of distribution  ascribed to _peninsulae_ from those provinces actually represent  _orestes_ (see Allen, 1940:949-50). _A. sylvaticus_ is distinguishable  from _peninsulae_ by darker ears, blackish preauricular patches, dark  eye rings, a noticeably smaller skull, incisive foramina that reach the  level of Ml (or nearly so), much larger auditory bullae, and a more  fully developed posterointernal cusp on M1.

Because, in the latter instance, I'm not sure we should interfere.  It may be her only chance.\"    [Illustration]    \"Carl!\" his wife cried indignantly. \"That's a horrid thing to say! You  must rescue her at once!\"    \"Oh, I suppose so,\" he said, then gave his wife a nasty little grin that  he knew would irritate her. \"It isn't that she's unattractive, my dear,  in case you hadn't noticed, though she's pretty well past the bloom of  youth--\"    \"_Will_ you stop making leering noises and go save her or _not_?\"    \"I was coming to that. It's just that she persists in using her Ph.D. as  a club to beat men into respectful pulps. Men don't like being beaten  into respectful pulps, whether by a man or a woman. Now if she'd only  learned that other people have feelings--\"    \"If you don't stop lecturing and go, I will!\" his wife threatened.    \"All right, all right,\" he said wearily. \"Come on, Mortland.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The two scientists slogged through the steamy, odorous jungle of Venus  and soon reached the lizard-man, who, weighed down by his captive, had  not been able to travel as fast.    \"You blast him,\" the professor told Mortland. \"Try not to hit Miss  Anspacher, if you can manage it.\"    \"Er--I've never fired one of these things before,\" Mortland said. \"Can't  stand having my eardrums blasted. However, here goes.\" He pointed his  weapon at the lizardlike creature in a gingerly manner. \"Ah--hands up,\"  he ordered. \"Only fair to give the--well, blighter a sporting chance,\"  he explained to Professor Bernardi.    To their amazement, the lizard-man promptly dropped Miss Anspacher into  the lavender-colored mud and put up his hands. Miss Anspacher gave an  indignant yelp.    \"Seems intelligent in spite of the kidnaping,\" Mortland commented. \"But  how does he happen to understand English? We're the only expedition ever  to have reached Venus ... that I know of, anyway.\" He and the professor  stared at each other in consternation. \"There may have been a secret  expedition previously and perhaps they left a--a base or something,  which would explain why--\"    \"If you two oafs would stop speculating, you might help me out of  here!\" Miss Anspacher remarked in her customary snappish tone. Professor  Bernardi leaped forward to obey. \"You don't have to pull quite so hard!  I haven't taken root yet!\" She came out of the mud with a sound like two  whales kissing. She brushed hopelessly at her once-white blouse and  shorts. \"Oh, dear, I look a mess!\"    Professor Bernardi did not comment, being engaged in slapping at a small  winged creature--about the size of a bluejay, but looking like a cross  between a bat and a mosquito--that seemed interested in taking a bite  out of him. It escaped his flapping hand and flew to the top of  Mortland's sun helmet, where it glared at the professor.    \"Since you seem to understand English,\" Miss Anspacher said to the  lizard-man through a mouthful of hairpins, \"perhaps you will be so kind  as to explain the meaning of this outrage?\"    \"I was smitten,\" the alien replied suavely. \"Passion made me forget  myself.\"    Professor Bernardi looked thoughtfully at him. \"A prior expedition isn't  the answer. It wouldn't have troubled to educate you so thoroughly.  Therefore, the explanation is that you pick up English by reading our  minds. Correct?\"    The lizard-man turned an embarrassed olive. \"Yes.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Now that he was able to give the creature a more thorough inspection,  Bernardi saw that he really didn't look too much like a lizard. He  definitely appeared to be wearing clothes of some kind, which, in the  Venusian heat, indicated a particularly refined degree of  civilization--unless, of course, the squamous skin protected him from  the heat as well as the humidity.    More than that, though, he was humanoid in almost a Hollywood way. He  had a particularly fine profile and an athletic physique, which, oddly,  his scales seemed to enhance, much like a movie idol dressed in  fine-meshed Medieval armor. Naturally, he had a tail, but it was as well  proportioned as a kangaroo's, though shorter and more graceful, and it  struck Professor Bernardi as a particularly handsome and useful gadget.    For one thing, the people from Earth were standing uncomfortably in the  slippery mud, while the lizard-man was using his tail much in the  fashion of a spectator stool, leaning back against it almost in a  sitting position, with his armor-shod feet supporting him comfortably.  For another, the tail undoubtedly served for balance and the added push  of a walking stick and perhaps for swift attack or getaway. Very  practical and attractive, the professor concluded--too bad Man had  relinquished his tail when climbing down from the trees.    \"Thank you,\" the saurian said with uneasy modesty, looking at him. \"Good  of you to think so. You are a fairly intelligent species, aren't you?\"    \"Fairly,\" the professor acknowledged, preoccupied with a clever idea.  Perhaps existence on Venus wasn't going to be as unpleasant as he had  anticipated. \"From reading my mind, you know what this blaster can do,  don't you?\"    \"I'm afraid so.\"    \"Then you know what I expect of you?\"    \"Yes, sahib. I'se comin', massa. To hear is to obey, effendi.\" The  creature turned and went briskly back toward the camp, leaving the  others to stumble after him.    Mrs. Bernardi gave a shriek as his handsome scaled form emerged from the  greenish-white underbrush, haloed in luminous yellow mist. Algol, the  ship's cat, prudently took sanctuary behind her, then peered out to see  what was going on and whether there was likely to be anything in it for  him.    \"This is our native bearer,\" Professor Bernardi explained as the three  scientists burst out of the jungle.    \"My name is Jrann-Pttt.\" The creature bowed low. \"At your service,  madame.\"    \"Oh, Carl!\" Mrs. Bernardi clapped her hands. \"He's just perfect! So  thoughtful of you to find one that speaks English! I do hope you can  cook, Pitt?\"    \"I will do my best, madame.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Algol daintily picked his way through the mud toward the saurian,  sniffed him with judicial deliberation; then, deciding that anyone who  smelled so much like the better class of fish must be All Right, rubbed  against his legs.    \"Well,\" remarked Miss Anspacher, using the side of the spaceship as a  mirror by which to redden her somewhat prissy lips, \"that makes it  practically unanimous, doesn't it?\"    \"All except Professor Bernardi,\" said Jrann-Pttt, looking at the  scientist with what might have been a smile. \"He doesn't like me.\"    \"I see that your telepathic powers are not quite accurate,\" the  professor returned. \"I do not dislike you; I distrust you.\"    \"The fact that the two terms are not entirely synonymous in your  language would argue a certain degree of incipient civilization,\" the  lizard-man observed.    \"You know, Carl,\" Mrs. Bernardi whispered, \"he has an awfully funny way  of talking, for a native.\"    \"Frankly I don't like this at all, Professor,\" Captain Greenfield said,  mopping his brow with a limp handkerchief. \"If I hadn't been off looking  for a better berth for the ship--all this mud worries me--this'd never  have happened.\"    \"You mean you would have let the lizard get away with Miss Anspacher?\"    The big man's face flushed crimson. \"I don't think that's funny,  Professor.\"    Bernardi quickly changed the subject, for he realized that the captain,  being by far the most muscular of the party, was not a man to trifle  with. \"Tell me, Greenfield, did you succeed in finding a better spot for  the ship? I must admit I'm worried about that mud myself.\"    \"Only remotely dry spot around is an outcropping 'bout two kilometers  away,\" Greenfield said grudgingly. He shifted his camp stool in a futile  search for shade. Even though the sun never penetrated the thick layer  of clouds, the yellow light diffused through them was blinding. \"Might  be big enough, but it's not level. Could blast it smooth, but that'd  take at least a week--Earth time.\"    Bernardi pulled his damp shirt away from his body. \"Well, I daresay  we'll be all right where we are, if we're not assailed by any violent  forces of nature. On Earth, this might be a monsoon climate.\"    \"If you ask me, that monster is more of a danger than any monsoon.\"    Bernardi sighed. Although by far the most competent officer available  for the job of spaceship captain, Greenfield was not quite the man he  would have chosen to be his associate for months on end. Still,  beggars--as Miss Anspacher might have eloquently put it--could not be  choosers. \"What makes you say that?\" he asked, trying to set an example  of tolerance.    \"Don't like the idea of him cooking for us,\" the captain said  stubbornly. \"Might poison us all in our beds.\"    \"Well, don't eat in your bed,\" suggested Mortland, strolling out of the  airlock in the company of the cat. Algol, however, finding that the spot  beside the captain's camp stool was as dry as anything could be on  Venus, decided to turn back.           *       *       *       *       *    \"The difficulty is easily overcome, Captain,\" the professor"]]]
