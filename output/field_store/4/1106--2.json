After the very copious and excellent remarks upon the objects of the  present history contained in the Author's Preface, the Translator feels  that it would be useless on his part to add any further explanation.    It would not be right, however, to close these volumes without some  acknowledgment of the valuable assistance he has received. Amongst  others, he is particularly indebted to Dr. Traill, of Liverpool, who  after proceeding to some length with a translation of this work, kindly  placed what he had completed in the hands of the Translator, with  liberty to make such use of it as might be deemed advantageous to the  present undertaking. To Mr. W. Y. Ottley, who also contemplated, and in  part executed, a version of the same author, the Translator has to  express his obligations for several explanations of terms of art, which  the intimacy of that gentleman with the fine arts, in all their  branches, peculiarly qualifies him to impart.[1] Similar acknowledgments  are due to an enlightened and learned foreigner, Mr. Panizzi, of  Liverpool, for his kind explanation of various obscure phrases and  doubtful passages.    Notwithstanding the anxious desire and unremitting endeavours of the  Translator to render this work, in all instances, as accurate as the  nature of the subject, and the numerous difficulties he had to surmount  would allow, yet, in dismissing it from his hands, he cannot repress the  feeling that he must throw himself upon the indulgence of the public to  excuse such errors as may be discoverable in the text. He trusts,  however, that where it may be found incorrect, it will for the most part  be in those passages where doubtful terms of art lay in his way,  intelligible only to the initiated, and which perhaps many of the  countrymen of Lanzi themselves might not be able very readily to  explain.

When detached or individual histories become so numerous that they can  neither be easily collected nor perused, the public interest requires a  writer capable of arranging and embodying them in the form of a general  historical narrative; not, indeed, by a minute detail of their whole  contents, but by selecting from each that which appears most interesting  and instructive. Hence it mostly happens, that the diffuse compositions  of earlier ages are found to give place to compendiums, and to succinct  history. If this desire has prevailed in former times, it has been, and  now is, more especially the characteristic of our own. We live in an age  highly favourable, in one sense at least, to the cultivation of  intellect: the boundaries of science are now extended beyond what our  forefathers could have hoped, much less foreseen; and we become anxious  only to discover the readiest methods of obtaining a competent  knowledge, at least, of several sciences, since it is impossible to  acquire them all. On the other hand, the ages preceding ours, since the  revival of learning, being more occupied about words than things, and  admiring certain objects that now seem trivial to the generality of  readers, have produced historical compositions, the separate nature of  which demands combination, no less than their prolixity requires  abridgment.    If these observations are applicable to other branches of history, they  are especially so to the history of painting. Its materials are found  ready prepared, scattered through numerous memoirs of artists of every  school which, from time to time, have been given to the public: and  additional articles are supplied by dictionaries of art, letters on  painting, guides to several cities, catalogues of various collections,  and by many tracts relating to different artists, which have been  published in Italy. But these accounts, independent of want of  connexion, are not useful to the generality of readers. Who, indeed,  could form a just idea of painting in Italy by perusing the works of  certain historians of latter ages, and some even of our own time, which  abound in invectives, and in attempts to exalt favourite masters above  the artists of all other schools; and which confer eulogies  indiscriminately upon professors of first, second, or third-rate  merit?[2] How few are there who feel interested in knowing all that is  said of artists with so much verbosity by Vasari, Pascoli, or  Baldinucci; their low jests, their amours, their private affairs, and  their eccentricities? What do we learn by being informed of the  jealousies of the Florentine artists, the quarrels of the Roman, or the  boasts of the Bolognian schools? Who can endure the verbal accuracy with  which their wills and testaments are recorded, even to the subscription  of the notary, as if the author had been drawing up a legal document; or  the descriptions of their stature and physiognomy, more minute than the  ancients afford us of Alexander or Augustus?[3] Not that I object to the  introduction of such particulars in the lives of the great luminaries of  art: in a Raffaello or a Caracci minute circumstances derive interest  from the subject; but how intolerable do they become in the life of an  ordinary individual, where the principal incidents are but little  interesting? Suetonius has not written the lives of his Caesars and his  grammarians in the same manner: the former he has rendered familiar to  the reader; the latter are merely noticed and passed over.    The tastes of individuals, however, are different, and some people  delight in minutiae, as it regards both the present and the past; and  since it may be of utility to those who may hereafter be inclined to  give a very full and perfect history of every thing relating to Italian  painting, let us view with indulgence those who have employed themselves  in compiling lives so copious, and let those who have time to spare,  beguile it with their perusal. At the same time, due regard should be  paid to that very respectable class of readers, who, in a history of  painting, would rather contemplate the artist than the man; and who are  less solicitous to become acquainted with the character of a single  painter, whose solitary and insulated history cannot prove instructive,  than with the genius, the method, the invention, and the style of a  great number of artists, with their characteristics, their merits, and  their rank, the result of which is a history of the whole art.    To this object there is no one whom I know who has hitherto dedicated  his pen, although it seems to be recommended no less by the passion  indulged by princes for the fine arts, than by the general diffusion of  a knowledge of them among all ranks. The habit of travelling, rendered  more familiar to private persons by the example of many great  sovereigns, the traffic in pictures, now become a branch of commerce  important to Italy, and the philosophic genius of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34501"],[0,"Wolf and Coyote Trapping: An Up-to-Date Wolf Hunter's Guide (#1)"],[1,"and Coyote  Trapping    An Up-to-Date Wolf Hunter's Guide, Giving the  Most Successful Methods of Experienced  \"Wolfers\" for Hunting and Trapping  These Animals, Also Gives  Their Habits in Detail.

There however, are no animals that destroy so much stock  as wolves and coyotes as they largely live upon the property of  farmers, settlers and ranchmen to which they add game as they can get  it.    While these animals are trapped, shot, poisoned, hunted with dogs,  etc., their numbers, in some states, seem to be on the increase  rather than the decrease in face of the fact that heavy bounties are  offered.    The fact that wolf and coyote scalps command a bounty, in many  states, and in addition their pelts are valuable, makes the hunting  and trapping of these animals of no little importance.    One thing that has helped to keep the members of these \"howlers\" so  numerous is the fact that they are among the shrewdest animal in  America. The day of their extermination is, no doubt, far in the  distance.    This book contains much of value to those who expect to follow the  business of catching wolves and coyotes. A great deal of the habits  and many of the methods were written by Mr. E. Kreps, who has had  experience with these animals upon the Western Plains, in Canada, and  the South. Additional information has been secured from Government  Bulletins and experienced \"wolfers\" from various parts of America.      A. R. Harding.        WOLF AND COYOTE TRAPPING        CHAPTER I.    THE TIMBER WOLF.    Wolves of all species belong to that class of animals known as the  dog family, the members of which are considered to be the most  intelligent of brute animals. They are found, in one species or  another, in almost every part of the world. They are strictly  carnivorous and are beyond all doubt the most destructive of all wild  animals.    In general appearance the wolf resembles a large dog having erect  ears, elongated muzzle, long heavy fur and bushy tail. The size and  color varies considerably as there are many varieties.    The wolves of North America may be divided into two distinct groups,  namely, the large timber wolves, and the prairie wolves or coyotes  (ki'-yote). Of the timber wolves there are a number of varieties,  perhaps species, for there is considerable difference in size and  color. For instance there is the small black wolf which is still  found in Florida, and the large Arctic wolf which is found in far  Northern Canada and Alaska, the color of which is a pure white with a  black tip to the tail. Then there is that intermediate variety known  as the Grey Wolf, also called \"Timber Wolf,\" \"Lobo\" and \"Wolf,\" the  latter indefinite name being used throughout the West to distinguish  the animal from the prairie species. It is the most common of the  American wolves, the numbers of this variety being in excess of all  of the others combined. In addition to those mentioned, there are  others such as the Red Wolf of Texas and the Brindled Wolf of Mexico.  All of these, however, belong to the group known to naturalists as  the Timber Wolves. Just how many species and how many distinct  varieties there are is not known.    As a rule, the largest wolves are found in the North; the Gray Wolves  of the western plains being slightly smaller than the white and Dusky  Wolves of Northern Canada and Alaska, specimens of which, it is said,  sometimes weigh as much as one hundred and fifty pounds. Again the  wolves of the southern part of the United States and of Mexico are  smaller than the gray variety.      [Illustration: The Range of the Timber Wolf.]    The average full grown wolf will measure about five feet in length,  from the end of the nose to the tip of the tail, and will weigh from  eighty to one hundred pounds, but specimens have been killed which  far exceeded these figures. The prevailing color is gray, being  darkest on the back and dusky on the shoulders and hips. The tail is  very bushy and the fur of the body is long and shaggy. The ears are  erect and pointed, the muzzle long and heavy, the eyes brown and  considering the fierce, bloodthirsty nature of the animal, have a  very gentle expression.    In early days wolves were found in all parts of the country but they  have been exterminated or driven out of the thickly settled portions  and their present distribution in the United States is shown by the  accompanying map. As will be noted they are found in only a small  portion of Nevada and none are found in California, but they are to  be met with in all other states west of the Missouri and the lower  Mississippi, also all of the most southern tier of states, as well as  those parts bordering on Lake Superior. A few are yet found in the  Smokey Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee. They are probably  most abundant in Northern Michigan and Northern Minnesota, Western  Wyoming, Montana and New Mexico.    Wyoming is the center of the wolf infested country and they are found  in greatest numbers in that state, on the headwaters of the Green  River. As to the numbers still found the report of the Biological  Survey for the years 1895 to 1906, inclusive, but not including the  year 1898, shows that bounties were paid on 20,819 wolves in that  state.    In Northern Michigan they are also abundant. In the year 1907,  thirty-four wolves were killed in Ontonagon County; in Luce County  fifty-four were killed up to November 10th, '07, and in Schoolcraft  Co., thirty were killed from October 1st, '07 to April 29th, '08.  This gives a total of one hundred and eighteen wolves killed in three  out of the sixteen counties of the Upper Peninsula. These statistics  are from a pamphlet issued by the Department of Agriculture.    The breeding season of the timber wolves is not as definite as that  of many of the furbearing animals, for the young make their  appearance from early in March until in May, and an occasional litter  will be born during the summer, even as late as August. The mating  season of course varies, but is mainly in January and February, the  period of gestation being nine weeks. The number in a litter varies  from five to thirteen, the usual number being eight or ten.    In early days the wolves of the western plains followed the great  buffalo herds and preyed on the young animals, also the old and  feeble. After the extermination of that animal they turned their  attention to the herds of cattle which soon covered the great western  range and their depredations have become a positive nuisance. In the  Northern States and throughout Canada they subsist almost entirely on  wild game.      [Illustration: Western Grey Wolf in a Trap.]    Wolves den in the ground or rocks in natural dens if such can be  found, but in case natural excavations are rare as in northern  portions of the country, they appropriate and enlarge the homes of  other animals. In the heavily timbered country they sometimes den in  hollow logs.    The wolf is both cowardly and courageous, depending on circumstances.  When found singly, and especially in daylight the animal is as much  of a coward as any creature could possibly be, and especially does it  fear man. But when suffering from the pangs of hunger and when  traveling in bands as they usually do, they are bold, fierce and  bloodthirsty creatures. In such cases they have been known to attack  man.    When hunting large game, wolves always go in bands, usually of three  to five but often a larger number. They invariably kill animals by  springing on from behind and hamstringing the victim. Small game is  hunted by lone animals.    The great losses suffered by stockmen in the West led the Biological  Survey, in connection with the Forest Service of the Department of  Agriculture, to"]]]
