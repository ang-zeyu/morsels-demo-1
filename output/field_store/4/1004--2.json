THE SOUND                                  OF SILENCE                               BY BARBARA CONSTANT           Most people, when asked to define the ultimate in       loneliness, say it's being alone in a crowd. And it takes       only one slight difference to make one forever alone in the       crowd....                             ILLUSTRATED BY SCHELLING           *       *       *       *       *          Nobody at Hoskins, Haskell & Chapman, Incorporated, knew jut why  Lucilla Brown, G.G. Hoskins' secretary, came to work half an hour  early every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Even G.G. himself, had he  been asked, would have had trouble explaining how his occasional  exasperated wish that just once somebody would reach the office ahead  of him could have caused his attractive young secretary to start doing  so three times a week ... or kept her at it all the months since that  first gloomy March day. Nobody asked G.G. however--not even Paul  Chapman, the very junior partner in the advertising firm, who had  displayed more than a little interest in Lucilla all fall and winter,  but very little interest in anything all spring and summer. Nobody  asked Lucilla why she left early on the days she arrived early--after  all, eight hours is long enough. And certainly nobody knew where  Lucilla went at 4:30 on those three days--nor would anybody in the  office have believed it, had he known.    \"Lucky Brown? seeing a psychiatrist?\" The typist would have giggled,  the office boy would have snorted, and every salesman on the force  would have guffawed. Even Paul Chapman might have managed a wry smile.  A real laugh had been beyond him for several months--ever since he  asked Lucilla confidently, \"Will you marry me?\" and she answered, \"I'm  sorry, Paul--thanks, but no thanks.\"    Not that seeing a psychiatrist was anything to laugh at, in itself. After  all, the year was 1962, and there were almost as many serious articles  about mental health as there were cartoons about psychoanalysts, even in  the magazines that specialized in poking fun. In certain cities--including  Los Angeles--and certain industries--especially advertising--\"I have an  appointment with my psychiatrist\" was a perfectly acceptable excuse for  leaving work early. The idea of a secretary employed by almost the largest  advertising firm in one of the best-known suburbs in the sprawling City of  the Angels doing so should not, therefore, have seemed particularly odd.  Not would it have, if the person involved had been anyone at all except  Lucilla Brown.    The idea that she might need aid of any kind, particularly  psychiatric, was ridiculous. She had been born twenty-two years  earlier in undisputed possession of a sizable silver spoon--and she  was, in addition, bright, beautiful, and charming, with 20/20 vision,  perfect teeth, a father and mother who adored her, friends who did  likewise ... and the kind of luck you'd have to see to believe. Other  people entered contests--Lucilla won them. Other people drove five  miles over the legal speed limit and got caught doing it--Lucilla  out-distanced them, but fortuitously slowed down just before the  highway patrol appeared from nowhere. Other people waited in the wrong  line at the bank while the woman ahead of them learned how to roll  pennies--Lucilla was always in the line that moved right up to the  teller's window.    \"Lucky\" was not, in other words, just a happenstance abbreviation of  \"Lucilla\"--it was an exceedingly apt nickname. And Lucky Brown's  co-workers would have been quite justified in laughing at the very  idea of her being unhappy enough about anything to spend three  precious hours a week stretched out on a brown leather couch staring  miserably at a pale blue ceiling and fumbling for words that refused  to come. There were a good many days when Lucilla felt like laughing  at the idea herself. And there were other days when she didn't even  feel like smiling.    Wednesday, the 25th of July, was one of the days when she didn't feel  like smiling. Or talking. Or moving. It had started out badly when she  opened her eyes and found herself staring at a familiar blue ceiling.  \"I don't know,\" she said irritably. \"I tell you, I simply don't know  what happens. I'll start to answer someone and the words will be right  on the tip of my tongue, ready to be spoken, then I'll say something  altogether different. Or I'll start to cross the street and, for no  reason at all, be unable to even step off the curb....\"    \"For no reason at all?\" Dr. Andrews asked. \"Are you sure you aren't  withholding something you ought to tell me?\"    She shifted a little, suddenly uncomfortable ... and then she was  fully awake and the ceiling was ivory, not blue. She stared at it for  a long moment, completely disoriented, before she realized that she  was in her own bed, not on Dr. Andrews' brown leather couch, and that  the conversation had been another of the interminable imaginary  dialogues she found herself carrying on with the psychiatrist, day and  night, awake and asleep.    \"Get out of my dreams,\" she ordered crossly, summoning up a quick  mental picture of Dr. Andrews' expressive face, level gray eyes, and  silvering temples, the better to banish him from her thoughts. She was  immediately sorry she had done so, for the image remained fixed in her  mind; she could almost feel his eyes as she heard his voice ask again,  \"For no reason at all, Lucilla?\"           *       *       *       *       *    The weatherman had promised a scorcher, and the heat that already lay  like a blanket over the room made it seem probable the promise would  be fulfilled. She moved listlessly, showering patting herself dry,  lingering over the choice of a dress until her mother called urgently  from the kitchen.    She was long minutes behind schedule when she left the house. Usually  she rather enjoyed easing her small car into the stream of automobiles  pouring down Sepulveda toward the San Diego Freeway, jockeying for  position, shifting expertly from one lane to another to take advantage  of every break in the traffic. This morning she felt only angry  impatience; she choked back on the irritated impulse to drive directly  into the side of a car that cut across in front of her, held her horn  button down furiously when a slow-starting truck hesitated  fractionally after the light turned green.    When she finally edged her Renault up on the \"on\" ramp and the freeway  stretched straight and unobstructed ahead, she stepped down on the  accelerator and watched the needle climb up and past the legal 65-mile  limit. The sound of her tires on the smooth concrete was soothing and  the rush of wind outside gave the morning an illusion of coolness. She  edged away from the tangle of cars that had pulled onto the freeway  with her and momentarily was alone on the road, with her rear-view  mirror blank, the oncoming lanes bare, and a small rise shutting off  the world ahead.    That was when it happened. \"Get out of the way!\" a voice shrieked  \"out of the way, out of the way, OUT OF THE WAY!\" Her heart lurched,  her stomach twisted convulsively, and there was a brassy taste in her  mouth. Instinctively, she stamped down on the brake pedal, swerved  sharply into the outer lane. By the time she had topped the rise, she  was going a cautious 50 miles an hour and hugging the far edge of the  freeway. Then, and only then, she heard the squeal of agonized tires  and saw the cumbersome semitrailer coming from the opposite direction  rock dangerously, jackknife into the dividing posts that separated  north and south-bound traffic, crunch ponderously through them, and  crash to a stop, several hundred feet ahead of her and squarely  athwart the lane down which she had been speeding only seconds  earlier.    The highway patrol materialized within minutes. Even so, it was after  eight by the time Lucilla gave them her statement, agreed for the  umpteenth time with the shaken but uninjured truck driver that it was  indeed fortunate she hadn't been in the center lane, and drove slowly  the remaining miles to the office. The gray mood of early morning had  changed to black. Now there were two voices in her mind, competing for  attention. \"I knew it was going to happen,\" the truck driver said, \"I  couldn't see over the top of that hill. All I could do was fight the  wheel and pray that if anybody was coming, he'd get out of the way.\"  She could almost hear him repeating the words, \"Get out of the way,  out of the way....\" And right on the heel of his cry came Dr.  Andrews' soft query, \"For no reason at all, Lucilla?\"    She pulled into the company parking lot, jerked the wheel savagely to  the left, jammed on the brakes. \"Shut up!\" she said. \"Shut up, both of  you!\" She started into the building, then hesitated. She was already  late, but there was something.... (Get out of the way, the way.... For  no reason at all, at all....) She yielded to impulse and walked  hurriedly downstairs to the basement library.    \"That stuff I asked you to get together for me by tomorrow, Ruthie,\"  she said to the gray-haired librarian. \"You wouldn't by any chance  have already done it, would you?\"    \"Funny you should ask.\" The elderly woman bobbed down behind the  counter and popped back up with an armload of magazines and  newspapers. \"Just happened to have some free time last thing  yesterday. It's already charged out to you, so you just go right ahead  and take it, dearie.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was 8:30 when Lucilla reached the office.    \"When I need you, where are you?\" G.G. asked sourly. \"Learned last  night that the top dog at Karry Karton Korporation is in town today,  so they've"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3029"],[0,"Real Soldiers of Fortune (#1)"],[1,"SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE      By Richard Harding Davis            MAJOR-GENERAL HENRY RONALD DOUGLAS MACIVER    ANY sunny afternoon, on Fifth Avenue, or at night in the _table d'hote_  restaurants of University Place, you may meet the soldier of fortune who  of all his brothers in arms now living is the most remarkable. You may  have noticed him; a stiffly erect, distinguished-looking man, with gray  hair, an imperial of the fashion of Louis Napoleon, fierce blue eyes,  and across his forehead a sabre cut.    This is Henry Ronald Douglas MacIver, for some time in India an ensign  in the Sepoy mutiny; in Italy, lieutenant under Garibaldi; in Spain,  captain under Don Carlos; in our Civil War, major in the Confederate  army; in Mexico, lieutenant-colonel under the Emperor Maximilian;  colonel under Napoleon III, inspector of cavalry for the Khedive of  Egypt, and chief of cavalry and general of brigade of the army of King  Milan of Servia. These are only a few of his military titles. In 1884  was published a book giving the story of his life up to that year. It  was called \"Under Fourteen Flags.\" If to-day General MacIver were to  reprint the book, it would be called \"Under Eighteen Flags.\"    MacIver was born on Christmas Day, 1841, at sea, a league off the shore  of Virginia. His mother was Miss Anna Douglas of that State; Ronald  MacIver, his father, was a Scot, a Rossshire gentleman, a younger son of  the chief of the Clan MacIver. Until he was ten years old young MacIver  played in Virginia at the home of his father. Then, in order that he  might be educated, he was shipped to Edinburgh to an uncle, General  Donald Graham. After five years his uncle obtained for him a commission  as ensign in the Honorable East India Company, and at sixteen, when  other boys are preparing for college, MacIver was in the Indian Mutiny,  fighting, not for a flag, nor a country, but as one fights a wild  animal, for his life. He was wounded in the arm, and, with a sword, cut  over the head. As a safeguard against the sun the boy had placed inside  his helmet a wet towel. This saved him to fight another day, but even  with that protection the sword sank through the helmet, the towel, and  into the skull. To-day you can see the scar. He was left in the road  for dead, and even after his wounds had healed, was six weeks in the  hospital.    This tough handling at the very start might have satisfied some men, but  in the very next war MacIver was a volunteer and wore the red shirt of  Garibaldi. He remained at the front throughout that campaign, and until  within a few years there has been no campaign of consequence in which he  has not taken part. He served in the Ten Years' War in Cuba, in  Brazil, in Argentina, in Crete, in Greece, twice in Spain in Carlist  revolutions, in Bosnia, and for four years in our Civil War under  Generals Jackson and Stuart around Richmond. In this great war he was  four times wounded.    It was after the surrender of the Confederate army, that, with other  Southern officers, he served under Maximilian in Mexico; in Egypt, and  in France. Whenever in any part of the world there was fighting, or the  rumor of fighting, the procedure of the general invariably was the  same. He would order himself to instantly depart for the front, and on  arriving there would offer to organize a foreign legion. The command of  this organization always was given to him. But the foreign legion was  merely the entering wedge. He would soon show that he was fitted for  a better command than a band of undisciplined volunteers, and would  receive a commission in the regular army. In almost every command in  which he served that is the manner in which promotion came. Sometimes he  saw but little fighting, sometimes he should have died several deaths,  each of a nature more unpleasant than the others. For in war the obvious  danger of a bullet is but a three hundred to one shot, while in the pack  against the combatant the jokers are innumerable. And in the career of  the general the unforeseen adventures are the most interesting. A man  who in eighteen campaigns has played his part would seem to have  earned exemption from any other risks, but often it was outside the  battle-field that MacIver encountered the greatest danger. He fought  several duels, in two of which he killed his adversary; several attempts  were made to assassinate him, and while on his way to Mexico he was  captured by hostile Indians. On returning from an expedition in Cuba he  was cast adrift in an open boat and for days was without food.    Long before I met General MacIver I had read his book and had heard of  him from many men who had met him in many different lands while  engaged in as many different undertakings. Several of the older war  correspondents knew him intimately; Bennett Burleigh of the _Telegraph_  was his friend, and E. F. Knight of the _Times_ was one of those who  volunteered for a filibustering expedition which MacIver organized  against New Guinea. The late Colonel Ochiltree of Texas told me tales  of MacIver's bravery, when as young men they were fellow officers in the  Southern army, and Stephen Bonsal had met him when MacIver was United  States Consul at Denia in Spain. When MacIver arrived at this post, the  ex-consul refused to vacate the Consulate, and MacIver wished to settle  the difficulty with duelling pistols. As Denia is a small place, the  inhabitants feared for their safety, and Bonsal, who was our _charge  d'affaires_ then, was sent from Madrid to adjust matters. Without  bloodshed he got rid of the ex-consul, and later MacIver so endeared  himself to the Denians that they begged the State Department to retain  him in that place for the remainder of his life.    Before General MacIver was appointed to a high position at the St. Louis  Fair, I saw much of him in New York. His room was in a side street in  an old-fashioned boarding-house, and overlooked his neighbor's back yard  and a typical New York City sumac tree; but when the general talked one  forgot he was within a block of the Elevated, and roamed over all  the world. On his bed he would spread out wonderful parchments, with  strange, heathenish inscriptions, with great seals, with faded ribbons.  These were signed by Sultans, Secretaries of War, Emperors, filibusters.  They were military commissions, titles of nobility, brevets for  decorations, instructions and commands from superior officers.  Translated the phrases ran: \"Imposing special confidence in,\" \"we  appoint,\" or \"create,\" or \"declare,\" or \"In recognition of services  rendered to our person,\" or \"country,\" or \"cause,\" or \"For bravery on  the field of battle we bestow the Cross----\"    As must a soldier, the general travels \"light,\" and all his worldly  possessions were crowded ready for mobilization into a small compass. He  had his sword, his field blanket, his trunk, and the tin despatch  boxes that held his papers. From these, like a conjurer, he would draw  souvenirs of all the world. From the embrace of faded letters, he would  unfold old photographs, daguerrotypes, and miniatures of fair women and  adventurous men: women who now are queens in exile, men who, lifted on  waves of absinthe, still, across a _cafe_ table, tell how they will win  back a crown.    Once in a written document the general did me the honor to appoint me  his literary executor, but as he is young, and as healthy as myself, it  never may be my lot to perform such an unwelcome duty. And to-day all  one can write of him is what the world can read in \"Under Fourteen  Flags,\" and some of the \"foot-notes to history\" which I have copied  from his scrap-book. This scrap-book is a wonderful volume, but owing  to \"political\" and other reasons, for the present, of the many clippings  from newspapers it contains there are only a few I am at liberty to  print. And from them it is difficult to make a choice. To sketch in a  few thousand words a career that had developed under Eighteen Flags is  in its very wealth embarrassing.    Here is one story, as told by the scrap-book, of an expedition that  failed. That it failed was due to a British Cabinet Minister; for had  Lord Derby possessed the imagination of the Soldier of Fortune, his  Majesty's dominions might now be the richer by many thousands of square  miles and many thousands of black subjects.    On October 29, 1883, the following appeared in the London _Standard_:  \"The New Guinea Exploration and Colonization Company is already  chartered, and the first expedition expects to leave before Christmas.\"  \"The prospectus states settlers intending to join the first party must  contribute one hundred pounds toward the company. This subscription will  include all expenses for passage money. Six months' provisions will be  provided, together with tents and arms for protection. Each subscriber  of one hundred pounds is to obtain a certificate entitling him to one  thousand acres.\"    The view of the colonization scheme taken by the _Times_ of London, of  the same date, is less complaisant. \"The latest commercial sensation is  a proposed company for the seizure of New Guinea. Certain adventurous  gentlemen are looking out for one hundred others who have money and  a taste for buccaneering. When the company has been completed, its  share-holders are to place themselves under military regulations, sail  in a body for New Guinea, and without asking anybody's leave, seize  upon the island and at once, in some unspecified way, proceed to realize  large profits. If the idea does not suggest comparisons with the large  designs of Sir Francis Drake, it is at least not unworthy of Captain  Kidd.\"    When we remember the manner in which some of the colonies of Great  Britain were acquired, the _Times_ seems almost squeamish.    In a Melbourne paper, June, 1884, is the following paragraph:    \"Toward the latter part of 1883 the Government of Queensland planted the  flag of Great Britain on the"]]]
