GALBREATH      In the summer of 1946 a party from the University of Kansas Museum of  Natural History visited exposures of the Laverne formation in Beaver  County, Oklahoma, at the invitation of Dr. Stuart Schoff of the United  States Geological Survey. When examining the marl beds an Emydid turtle  was discovered which appears to be an unnamed species of the genus  _Chrysemys_. A description of the new species follows.                         Chrysemys limnodytes, new species      _Holotype._--University of Kansas Museum of Natural History No.    7676, vertebrate paleontological collection, a turtle consisting of    a fragmental anterior portion of a carapace, left part of the    plastron, and several marginals collected by the 1946    paleontological field party of the University of Kansas Museum of    Natural History.      _Geological Age and locality._--Marl beds of the Laverne formation,    early Pliocene age, in SW 1/4 Sec. 15, T. 4 N., R. 25 ECM, Beaver    County, Oklahoma. The specimen was removed from the marl    immediately below the fossil leaf zone (see Chaney and Elias, 1936;    Frye and Hibbard, 1940).      _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements) and differing from    other species of _Chrysemys_ in having: The anterior end of the    carapace broadly concave, the posterolateral marginals not greatly    flared, the posterior end of the plastron broadly indented, the    carapace more sculptured and relatively wider.    _Description of type._--The specimen had been badly damaged before  preservation, and had suffered further damage from exposure before  discovery. The anterior and posterior lobes of the plastron had been  folded over the bridge, forming a three-ply thickness of bone. Of the  carapace, only the following parts are known: Fragment of the nuchal;  right 1st, 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals, left 1st, 2d, 7th, 8th, 9th, and  11th marginals; costals 1-5 on the right side; costals 1-4 on the left  side; and 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th neurals. The left half of the plastron is  relatively complete, lacking only the epiplastron and entoplastron. The  left 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals are joined to the plastron at the  inguinal buttress, and the right 7th, 8th, and 9th marginals are  attached to the fifth costal. The carapace has smooth contours with no  keel present, but on the lower half of the costals there are seven or  eight ridges, and the remaining surface of the costals and neurals are  rugose. The marginals lack ridges, and the posterolateral marginals are  not serrated. The anterior end of the carapace has a broad shallow  notch. The first neural is rounded, and the 2d, 3d, and 4th are  hexagonal, with the broad ends forward. Anterior margins of the 2d and  3d neurals are concave, and the anterior margin of the 4th neural is  straight.    The sulci bounding the scutes are moderately impressed. The width of the  first vertebral scute, anteriorly and posteriorly, is less than the  width of the second vertebral scute. The costal scutes join the marginal  scutes on the marginal plates.    The plastron, broadly indented at the posterior end, does not have the  posterior lobe flared laterally as it is in Recent species of  _Chrysemys_, and lacks any pronounced notch at the femoro-anal suture.  The humero-pectoral sulcus crosses the plastron behind the entoplastron  in a straight line, and reaches the border anterior to the axillary  notch. The pectoro-abdominal suture is anteriorly convex at the sides  and concave at the midline.    A comparison of this carapace and plastron with a series of specimens of  Recent _Chrysemys picta_ and _Pseudemys scripta_ of approximately the  same size reveals characters indicated in the following chart:      ==================================================================     RECENT _Chrysemys_ | _Chrysemys limnodytes_ | RECENT _Pseudemys_    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Not serrated.       | Posterolateral         | Serrated.                        | marginals not serrated.|    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Not notched.        | Carapace with broad    | Notched.                        | shallow notch at       |                        | anterior end.          |    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Occasional faint    | Plastron does not have | Distinct notch at    notch at femoro-anal| a pronounced notch at  | femoro-anal suture.    suture.             | femoro-anal suture.    |    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Posterior lobe of   | Posterior lobe of      | Posterior lobe of    plastron flares     | plastron does not      | plastron does not    laterally.          | flare laterally.       | flare laterally.    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Carapace smooth.    | Carapace has smooth    | Carapace has                        | contours.              | depressions and                        |                        | elevations.    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Old specimens       | Seven or eight ridges  | Ridges cover    occasionally have   | on lower half of       | costals.    five or six ridges  | costals.               |    near border of      | Remaining surface of   |    costals.            | costals and neurals    |                        | rugose.                |    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    No ridges on        | No ridges on           | May or may not    marginals.          | marginals.             | have ridges on                        |                        | marginals.    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Nuchal smooth.      | Nuchal smooth.         | Nuchal has ridges.    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Carapace not        | Probably arched less   | Greatly arched.    greatly arched.     | than in _Pseudemys_,   |                        | but more than in any   |                        | Recent _Chrysemys_.    |    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Keel often present  | No keel present.       | Keel often present.    at birth, but soon  |                        |    lost.               |                        |    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Anterior and        | Anterior and posterior | Anterior width of    posterior widths of | widths of first        | first vertebral    first vertebral     | vertebral scute less   | scute less than    scute approximately | than width of second   | posterior width,    same as width of    | vertebral scute.       | or both dimensions    second vertebral    |                        | less than width of    scute.              |                        | second vertebral                        |                        | scute.    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Ribs do not tend    | Ribs not prominent on  | Ribs tend to be    to be prominent on  | costals.               | prominent on    costals.            |                        | costals.    --------------------+------------------------+--------------------    Hay attached considerable taxonomic importance to the characters of the  nuchal and I find its characters to be fairly constant in the specimens  of Emydidae examined. Although the nuchal of _Chrysemys limnodytes_ is  incomplete, it can be distinguished from the nuchals described by Hay as  types of his several fossil Emydids. Differences in the nuchal, together  with those in the carapace and plastron, serve to distinguish the  species from other genera of the Emydidae.    When the specimen is compared with _Chrysemys timida_ Hay, of the  Nebraska Pleistocene, many similarities, mostly of generic rank, are  seen. _Chrysemys limnodytes_ is broader in relation to length than is  either _C. timida_ or any Recent specimen examined of the same size. The  greatest allowance possible in estimating the length of _C. limnodytes_  fails to bring the ratio of its breadth to length within the range of  Recent specimens of similar size. Data from 96 specimens of Recent  _Chrysemys picta_ show that the ratio of length to width is not affected  by sex, but that the ratio does vary with the age of the specimen. In  young animals the length and width are approximately equal, but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34465"],[0,"A Little Book of Christmas (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

The good old Saint is everywhere        Along life's busy way.      We find him in the very air        We breathe day after day--      Where courtesy and kindliness        And love are joined together,      To give to sorrow and distress        A touch of sunny weather.        We find him in the maiden's eyes        Beneath the mistletoe,      A-sparkling as the star-lit skies        All golden in their glow.      We find him in the pressure of        The hand of sympathy,      And where there's any thought of love        He's mighty sure to be.        So here's to good old Kindliheart!        The best bet of them all,      Who never fails to do his part        In life's high festival;      The worthy bearer of the crown        With which we top the Saint.      A bumper to his health, and down        With them that say he ain't!          THE CONVERSION OF HETHERINGTON      I    Hetherington wasn't half a bad sort of a fellow, but he had his  peculiarities, most of which were the natural defects of a lack of  imagination. He didn't believe in ghosts, or Santa Claus, or any of the  thousands of other things that he hadn't seen with his own eyes, and as  he walked home that rather chilly afternoon just before Christmas and  found nearly every corner of the highway decorated with bogus Saints,  wearing the shoddy regalia of Kris-Kringle, the sight made him a trifle  irritable. He had had a fairly good luncheon that day, one indeed that  ought to have mellowed his disposition materially, but which somehow or  other had not so resulted. In fact, Hetherington was in a state of raspy  petulance that boded ill for his digestion, and when he had reached the  corner of Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue, the constant iteration  and reiteration of these shivering figures of the god of the Yule had  got on his nerves to such an extent as to make him aggressively  quarrelsome. He had controlled the asperities of his soul tolerably well  on the way uptown, but the remark of a small child on the highway, made  to a hurrying mother, as they passed a stalwart-looking replica of the  idol of his Christmas dreams, banging away on a tambourine to attract  attention to the iron pot before him, placed there to catch the pennies  of the charitably inclined wayfarer--\"Oh, mar, there's Sandy Claus  now!\"--was too much for him.    \"Tush! Nonsense!\" ejaculated Hetherington, glowering at the shivering  figure in the turkey-red robe. \"The idea of filling children's minds up  with such balderdash! Santa Claus, indeed! There isn't a genuine Santa  Claus in the whole bogus bunch.\"    The Saint on the corner banged his tambourine just under Hetherington's  ear with just enough force to jar loose the accumulated irascibility of  the well-fed gentleman.    \"This is a fine job for an able-bodied man like you!\" said Hetherington  with a sneer. \"Why don't you go to work instead of helping to perpetuate  this annual fake?\"    The Saint looked at him for a moment before replying.    \"Speakin' to me?\" he said.    \"Yes. I'm speaking to you,\" said Hetherington. \"Here's the whole country  perishing for the lack of labor, and in spite of that fact this town has  broken out into a veritable rash of fake Santa Clauses--\"    \"That'll do for you!\" retorted Santa Claus. \"It's easy enough for a  feller with a stomach full o' victuals and plenty of warm clothes on  his back to jump on a hard-workin' feller like me--\"    \"Hard-working?\" echoed Hetherington. \"I like that! You don't call  loafing on a street corner this way all day long hard work, do you?\"    He rather liked the man's spirit, despite his objection to his  occupation.    \"Suppose you try it once and find out,\" retorted Santa Claus, blowing on  his bluish fingers in an effort to restore their clogged-up circulation.  \"I guess if you tried a job like this just once, standin' out in the  cold from eight in the mornin' to ten at night, with nothin' but a cup  o' coffee and a ham-sandwich inside o' you--\"    \"What's that?\" cried Hetherington, aghast. \"Is that all you've had to  eat to-day?\"    \"That's all,\" said the Saint, as he turned to his work with the  tambourine. \"Try it once, mister, and maybe you won't feel so cock-sure  about its not bein' work. If you're half the sport you think you are  just take my place for a couple of hours.\"    An appeal to his sporting instinct was never lost on Hetherington.    \"By George!\" he cried. \"I'll go you. I'll swap coats with you, and while  you're filling your stomach up I'll take your place, all right.\"    \"What'll I fill me stomach up with?\" demanded the man. \"I don't look  like a feller with a meal-ticket in his pocket, do I?\"    \"I'll take care of that,\" said Hetherington, taking out a roll of bills  and peeling off a two-dollar note from the outside. \"There--you take  that and blow yourself, and I'll take care of the kitty here till you  come back.\"    The exchange of externals was not long in accomplishment. The gathering  of the shadows of night made it a comparatively easy matter to arrange  behind a conveniently stalled and heavily laden express wagon hard by,  and in a few moments the irascible but still \"sporty\" Hetherington, who  from childhood up to the present had never been able to take a dare,  found himself banging away on a tambourine and incidentally shivering in  the poor red habiliments of a fraudulent Saint. For a half-hour the  novelty of his position gave him a certain thrill, and no Santa Claus in  town that night fulfilled his duties more vociferously than did  Hetherington; but as time passed on, and the chill of a windy corner  began to penetrate his bones, to say nothing of the frosty condition of  his ears, which his false cotton whiskers but indifferently protected,  he began to tire of his bargain.    \"Gosh!\" he muttered to himself, as it began to snow, and certain passing  truckmen hurled the same kind of guying comments at him as had been more  or less in his mind whenever he had passed a fellow-Santa-Claus on his  way up-town, \"if General Sherman were here he'd find a twin-brother to  War! I wish that cuss would come back.\"    He gazed eagerly up and down the street in the hope that the departed  original would heave in sight, but in vain. A two-dollar meal evidently  possessed attractions that he wished to linger over.    \"Can't stand this much longer!\" he muttered to himself, and then his eye  caught sight of a group that filled his soul with dismay: two policemen  and the struggling figure of one who appeared to have looked not wisely  but too well upon the cup that cheers, the latter wearing Hetherington's  overcoat and Hetherington's hat, but whose knees worked upon hinges of  their own, double-back-action hinges that made his legs of no use  whatsoever, either to himself or to anybody else.    \"Hi there!\" Hetherington cried out, as the group passed up the street on  the way to the station-house. \"That fellow's got my overcoat--\"    But the only reply Hetherington got was a sturdy poke in the ribs from  the night-stick of the passing officer.    \"Well, I'll be jiggered!\" growled Hetherington.      II    Ten minutes later a passing taxi was hailed by a shivering gentleman  carrying an iron pot full of pennies and nickels and an occasional  quarter in one hand, and a turkey-red coat, trimmed with white cotton  cloth, thrown over his arm. Strange to say, considering the inclemency  of the night, he wore neither a hat nor an overcoat.    \"Where to, sir?\" queried the chauffeur.    \"The police-station,\" said Hetherington. \"I don't know where it is, but  the one in this precinct is the one I want.\"    \"Ye'll have to pay by the hour to-night, sir,\" said the chauffeur. \"The  station ain't a half-mile away, sir, but Heaven knows how long it'll  take us to get there.\"    \"Charge what you please,\" retorted Hetherington. \"I'll buy your darned  old machine if it's necessary, only get a move on.\"    The chauffeur, with some misgivings as to the mental integrity of his  fare, started on their perilous journey, and three-quarters of an hour  later drew up in front of the police-station, where Hetherington, having  been compelled in self-defense to resume the habiliments of Santa Claus  under penalty of freezing, alighted.    \"Just wait, will you?\" he"]]]
