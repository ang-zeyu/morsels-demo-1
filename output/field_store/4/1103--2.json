FITCH and RONALD L. MCGREGOR          Introduction      In northeastern Kansas, before it was disturbed by the arrival of  white settlers in the eighteen fifties, tall grass prairies and  deciduous forests were both represented. These two contrasting types  of vegetation overlapped widely in an interdigitating pattern which  was determined by distribution of moisture, soil types, slope exposure  and various biotic factors.    The early explorers who saw this region, and the settlers who came  later, left only incomplete descriptions, which were usually vague as  to the locality and the species of plants represented. As a result,  there is but little concrete information as to the precise boundaries  between the forests and grasslands, and opinions differ among  ecologists. No representative sample of either type remains.    It may be assumed that the plant communities existing one hundred  years ago and earlier were far more stable than those of the present  that have resulted from man's disruptive activities. This stability  was only relative, however. Within the last few thousand years since  the final withdrawal of the Wisconsinan ice sheet, fairly rapid and  continual change must have occurred, as a result of changing climate,  the sudden extinction of various large, dominant mammals, and finally  the impact of successive aboriginal cultures.    The land north of the Kansas River had been a reserve for the Delaware  Indians. This land was thrown open to settlement as a result of two  separate purchases from the tribe, in 1860 and 1866. The alluvial  bottomlands were fertile and soon were under cultivation.          History      Because the prairies and forests were soon destroyed or altered by  cow, ax, plow and fire, knowledge of the region's ecology under the  conditions that prevailed in the early nineteenth century and the  centuries before must be gained largely from circumstantial evidence.  Although there were no ecologists among the first settlers in Kansas,  occasional glimpses of the region's ecology are afforded by the writings  of early residents who mentioned native plant and animal life from time  to time. However, such mention was usually casual and fragmentary.    A brief early description of forest in northeastern Kansas, which is  casual and incomplete, and perhaps misleading, since it differs from  later accounts, was included in Major W. S. Long's report of the  exploring expedition that passed through country now included in  Johnson, Douglas, Shawnee, Wabaunsee, Riley, Pottawatomie, Jackson,  Jefferson and Leavenworth counties in 1819. \"The catalogue of the  forest trees in this region is not very copious. The cottonwood and  the plane tree [sycamore] everywhere form conspicuous features of the  forests. With these are intermixed the tall and graceful acacia, the  honey locust, and the bonduc, or coffee-tree, and carya [hickory] and  fraxinus [ash] ...\" (Taft, 1950:442).    A description of the country in northern Douglas County and adjacent  Leavenworth County, while it was still in virtually undisturbed  condition, was written by Mr. George S. Parks (1854). Travelling up  the Kansas River from the Missouri state line he described the  vegetation and physiography with respect to specific landmarks that  can be easily located at the present time. His descriptions of the  areas he saw that were nearest the Reservation, are quoted below, in  part.    [Travelling west from near the mouth of Stranger Creek 10 miles ESE  Reservation.] \"... bluff with open woods and high rolling prairie in  background. On the south side of the river ... grass and scattering  timber forming a green lawn back with high prairie. In this  neighborhood the shore is rocky. We passed a bald bluff on the north,  with a rich bottom on the south side, and a high open lawn in the  rear. A little farther on the elevated prairies strike the river,  giving a charming variety of scenery--while on the north are extended  bottoms of rich timbered lands.    \"In this vicinity we saw many Indians along the banks; we also passed  a grape thicket, in the bottom, spread over several thousand  acres--while just above, on our right, rose a rocky bluff, covered  with open woods. A little above this Sugar Creek empties into the  Kansas, from the right; and a little farther up, there is a low  bluff--a short distance beyond, there being another fine grape  thicket, and rich walnut bottom. On the right side of the river ...  rises a beautiful undulating eminence ... open woods and a fine  prairie about a mile back.    \"On the left, a short distance above, the Wakarusa flows in--a  considerable stream--with good timber for some way back.    \"On both sides of the river, above the Wakarusa, there are excellent  bottom lands; ... farther up on the south bank, the high prairie comes  down to the water's edge.... away as far as the eye could reach in a  southwest direction, the prairies were high and rolling, like the  waves of old ocean--southward, beautiful groves dot the prairie and  the dark line of timber that stretches along the Wakarusa Valley--with  the great Prairie-mound ... fixed there as a landmark of perpetual  beauty--the meandering river with its dark skirting forests of timber  on the north ... Proceeding north, high rich bottoms extend for many  miles and we saw vast thickets of grape-vines, pea-vines etc. and  paw-paws. The timber was principally oak, walnut, ash, hickory,  mulberry, hackberry, linden, cottonwood and coffee-bean.    [Between the Reservation and the mouth of the Delaware River, 10 miles  west.] \"A few miles below the mouth of the Grasshopper [Delaware] on  the north the prairie undulates gradually back from the river as far  as the eye can reach ... between the Grasshopper and Mud Creek there  is a prairie bottom where pioneers are making claims.\"    In 1855 Mrs. Sara T. D. Robinson, wife of Dr. Charles Robinson who was  the first governor of Kansas, described in her diary the environs of  Lawrence (1899). In part, the areas described by her overlap those  described by Parks, and both writers impart similar impressions. Mrs.  Robinson's writing was concerned chiefly with the social and political  affairs of the territory and the occasional comments on the \"scenery\"  in her voluble accounts must be regarded as impressions rather than  purposeful and accurate descriptions, as certain inconsistencies are  apparent. Excerpts from several of her more significant descriptive  passages are quoted below. [Between Lawrence and Kansas City, April  17, 1855.] \"... prairie stretching in all directions, noble forests  marking the line of the rivers and creeks, ... tall oaks and walnuts  grouped in admirable arrangement ... there were deep ravines ...  skirted with graceful trees, while the water in their pebbly beds is  limpid and clear.\" [North of Wakarusa Crossing.] \"... stumps in every  direction in the woods ...\" [At Lawrence, April 18, 1855.] \"The town  reaches to the river, whose further shore is skirted with a line of  beautiful timber, while beyond all rise the Delaware lands, which in  the distance have all the appearance of cultivated fields and  orchards.... A line of timber between us and Blue Mound marks the  course of the Wakarusa, while beyond the eye rests upon a country  diversified in surface, sloping hills, finely rolling prairies, and  timbered creeks ... to the northwest there is the most delightful  mingling together of hill, valley, prairie, woodland, and river ...  fine grove about a mile west of town, one of Nature's grand old  forests.\"    [On trip to visit a neighbor four miles away from Lawrence.] \"There  were high, conical hills, bearing on their tops forest trees, with  dense, thick foliage; at the next moment a little shady nook, with a  silvery rivulet running over its pebbly bed....\"    [On trip west toward Topeka.] \"Timber was more abundant, not only  marking the line of the creeks, but crowning the summit of many an  elevation.\"    [At Lawrence.] \"Lawrence and its surroundings, of river flowing  beneath the dim forests two miles deep on the north bank....\"    Parks' and Robinson's accounts seem to show that in general  bottomlands and stream courses were wooded, and uplands were mainly  prairie, but that local deviations from this pattern were numerous,  with trees and groves isolated or partly isolated in a variety of  situations. This condition suggests that prairies were then  encroaching into formerly wooded areas.

PREFACE      Ten years ago aviculture had hardly been thought of as a school subject.  To-day it is taught in thousands of schools, and in some states  instruction in poultry culture is required by law. This rapid change in  sentiment and situation has resulted from a combination of causes. When  agricultural colleges established poultry departments, it was found that  a large part of those applying for admission to them had neither the  practical knowledge of poultry nor the general education that they  needed to do work of college grade. About this time also the interest in  nature study began to take a more practical turn, and attention was  directed to the superiority of domesticated to wild animals and plants  as material for school studies of the phenomena of physical life. Added  to these special causes was a general cause more potent than either:  great numbers of people had reached the stage of experience in various  lines of aviculture where they realized keenly that a little sound  instruction in the subject in youth would have been of great value to  them later in life, saving them from costly mistakes. To these people it  seemed both natural and necessary that the schools should teach poultry  and pigeon culture.    Developing as the result of such a combination of causes, the demand for  an elementary textbook on poultry came with equal force from country  schools, where poultry might be kept on the school grounds as well as by  every pupil at home, from city schools, in which all instruction must be  by book, and from all types of schools and conditions of life between.  Had there been only the extreme classes of schools to consider, the  natural way to supply the demand would be with a special book for each  distinct type of school. The idea of one book for all schools, from  which each might use what seemed to suit its requirements, was dismissed  as impractical while so large a proportion of teachers were but slightly  acquainted with the subject. It is believed that the plan of making an  elementary reading course for general use, and a secondary book of a  more technical character for use where practice courses are given, is  the best solution of the problem under existing conditions.    In this first book the object is to tell in plain language the things  that every one ought to know about poultry, pigeons, and cage birds; to  teach fundamental facts in such a way that they will be fixed in the  mind; to excite interest in the subject where none existed; and to  direct enthusiasm along right lines. While the demand has been almost  wholly for a poultry book, pigeons and cage birds are included, because  they are of more interest than some kinds of poultry and better adapted  than any other kind to the conditions of city life.    In regard to the time that should be given to this course, one period a  week for forty weeks is better than a period a day for forty days,  because the average person, young or old, retains a great deal more of  what is read or heard about a diversified subject if the ground is  covered by easy stages with comparatively long intervals between.  References for collateral readings and suggestions for original  investigations are omitted, because, in the author's opinion, what work  of this kind it is desirable for a high-school pupil to do should be  done by those taking practice work in the advanced course.
