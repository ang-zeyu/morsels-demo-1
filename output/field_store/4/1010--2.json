The Birth Of Pennsylvania    In 1661, the year after Charles II was restored to the throne of  England, William Penn was a seventeen-year-old student at Christ Church,  Oxford. His father, a distinguished admiral in high favor at Court, had  abandoned his erstwhile friends and had aided in restoring King Charlie  to his own again. Young William was associating with the sons of the  aristocracy and was receiving an education which would fit him to obtain  preferment at Court. But there was a serious vein in him, and while at a  high church Oxford College he was surreptitiously attending the meetings  and listening to the preaching of the despised and outlawed Quakers.  There he first began to hear of the plans of a group of Quakers to found  colonies on the Delaware in America. Forty years afterwards he wrote, \"I  had an opening of joy as to these parts in the year 1661 at Oxford.\" And  with America and the Quakers, in spite of a brief youthful experience as  a soldier and a courtier, William Penn's life, as well as his fame, is  indissolubly linked.    Quakerism was one of the many religious sects born in the seventeenth  century under the influence of Puritan thought. The foundation principle  of the Reformation, the right of private judgment, the Quakers carried  out to its logical conclusion; but they were people whose minds had  so long been suppressed and terrorized that, once free, they rushed to  extremes. They shocked and horrified even the most advanced Reformation  sects by rejecting Baptism, the doctrine of the Trinity, and all  sacraments, forms, and ceremonies. They represented, on their best  side, the most vigorous effort of the Reformation to return to the  spirituality and the simplicity of the early Christians. But their  intense spirituality, pathetic often in its extreme manifestations,  was not wholly concerned with another world. Their humane ideas and  philanthropic methods, such as the abolition of slavery, and the reform  of prisons and of charitable institutions, came in time to be accepted  as fundamental practical social principles.    The tendencies of which Quakerism formed only one manifestation appeared  outside of England, in Italy, in France, and especially in Germany. The  fundamental Quaker idea of \"quietism,\" as it was called, or peaceful,  silent contemplation as a spiritual form of worship and as a development  of moral consciousness, was very widespread at the close of the  Reformation and even began to be practiced in the Roman Catholic Church  until it was stopped by the Jesuits. The most extreme of the English  Quakers, however, gave way to such extravagances of conduct as trembling  when they preached (whence their name), preaching openly in the  streets and fields--a horrible thing at that time--interrupting other  congregations, and appearing naked as a sign and warning. They gave  offense by refusing to remove their hats in public and by applying to  all alike the words \"thee\" and \"thou,\" a form of address hitherto used  only to servants and inferiors. Worst of all, the Quakers refused to  pay tithes or taxes to support the Church of England. As a result, the  loathsome jails of the day were soon filled with these objectors, and  their property melted away in fines. This contumacy and their street  meetings, regarded at that time as riotous breaches of the peace, gave  the Government at first a legal excuse to hunt them down; but as they  grew in numbers and influence, laws were enacted to suppress them. Some  of them, though not the wildest extremists, escaped to the colonies in  America. There, however, they were made welcome to conditions no less  severe.    The first law against the Quakers in Massachusetts was passed in 1656,  and between that date and 1660 four of the sect were hanged, one of them  a woman, Mary Dyer. Though there were no other hangings, many Quakers  were punished by whipping and banishment. In other colonies, notably New  York, fines and banishment were not uncommon. Such treatment forced the  Quakers, against the will of many of them, to seek a tract of land  and found a colony of their own. To such a course there appeared no  alternative, unless they were determined to establish their religion  solely by martyrdom.    About the time when the Massachusetts laws were enforced, the principal  Quaker leader and organizer, George Fox (1624-1691), began to consider  the possibility of making a settlement among the great forests and  mountains said to lie north of Maryland in the region drained by the  Delaware and Susquehanna rivers. In this region lay practically the only  good land on the Atlantic seaboard not already occupied. The Puritans  and Dutch were on the north, and there were Catholic and Church of  England colonies on the south in Maryland and Virginia. The middle  ground was unoccupied because heretofore a difficult coast had prevented  easy access by sea. Fox consulted Josiah Coale, a Quaker who had  traveled in America and had seen a good deal of the Indian tribes, with  the result that on his second visit to America Coale was commissioned to  treat with the Susquehanna Indians, who were supposed to have rights in  the desired land. In November, 1660, Coale reported to Fox the result  of his inquiries: \"As concerning Friends buying a piece of land of the  Susquehanna Indians I have spoken of it to them and told them what thou  said concerning it; but their answer was, that there is no land that is  habitable or fit for situation beyond Baltimore's liberty till they come  to or near the Susquehanna's Fort.\" * Nothing could be done immediately,  the letter went on to say, because the Indians were at war with one  another, and William Fuller, a Maryland Quaker, whose cooperation was  deemed essential, was absent.          * James Bowden's \"History of the Friends in America,\" vol. I, p.  389      This seems to have been the first definite movement towards a Quaker  colony. Reports of it reached the ears of young Penn at Oxford and set  his imagination aflame. He never forgot the project, for seventeen is an  age when grand thoughts strike home. The adventurousness of the plan was  irresistible--a home for the new faith in the primeval forest, far from  imprisonment, tithes, and persecution, and to be won by effort worthy of  a man. It was, however, a dream destined not to be realized for many a  long year. More was needed than the mere consent of the Indians. In  the meantime, however, a temporary refuge for the sect was found in the  province of West Jersey on the Delaware, which two Quakers had bought  from Lord Berkeley for the comparatively small sum of 1000 pounds. Of  this grant William Penn became one of the trustees and thus gained  his first experience in the business of colonizing the region of his  youthful dreams. But there was never a sufficient governmental control  of West Jersey to make it an ideal Quaker colony. What little control  the Quakers exercised disappeared after 1702; and the land and situation  were not all that could be desired. Penn, though also one of the owners  of East Jersey, made no attempt to turn that region into a Quaker  colony.    Besides West Jersey the Quakers found a temporary asylum in Aquidneck,  now Rhode Island. * For many years the governors and magistrates were  Quakers, and the affairs of this island colony were largely in their  hands. Quakers were also prominent in the politics of North Carolina,  and John Archdale, a Quaker, was Governor for several years. They formed  a considerable element of the population in the towns of Long Island and  Westchester County but they could not hope to convert these communities  into real Quaker commonwealths.          * This Rhode Island colony should be distinguished from the  settlement at Providence founded by Roger Williams with which it was  later united. See Jones, \"The Quakers in the American Colonies,\" p. 21,  note.      The experience in the Jerseys and elsewhere very soon proved that if  there was to be a real Quaker colony, the British Crown must give  not only a title to the land but a strong charter guaranteeing  self-government and protection of the Quaker faith from outside  interference. But that the British Government would grant such valued  privileges to a sect of schismatics which it was hunting down in England  seemed a most unlikely event. Nothing but unusual influence at Court  could bring it about, and in that quarter the Quakers had no influence.    Penn never forgot the boyhood ideal which he had developed at college.  For twenty years he led a varied life--driven from home and whipped by  his father for consorting with the schismatic; sometimes in deference  to his father's wishes taking his place in the gay world at Court; even,  for a time, becoming a soldier, and again traveling in France with some  of the people of the Court. In the end, as he grew older, religious  feeling completely absorbed him. He became one of the leading Quaker  theologians, and his very earnest religious writings fill several  volumes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#1)"],[1,"from the 1911 Harper and Brothers edition by David Price,  email ccx074@pglaf.org                                   NOTES OF A WAR CORRESPONDENT                                          BY                            RICHARD HARDING DAVIS                                   ILLUSTRATED                             CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS                     NEW YORK::::::::::::::::::::::::1911                               COPYRIGHT, 1897, BY                              HARPER & BROTHERS                                    * * * * *                         COPYRIGHT, 1898, 1900, 1910, BY                           CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS                       [Picture: At the front in Manchuria]    Contents:    The Cuban-Spanish War     The Death of Rodriguez  The Greek-Turkish War     The Battle of Velestinos  The Spanish-American War     I.

When the revolution in Cuba broke out young Rodriguez joined the  insurgents, leaving his father and mother and two sisters at the farm.  He was taken, in December of 1896, by a force of the Guardia Civile, the  corps d'elite of the Spanish army, and defended himself when they tried  to capture him, wounding three of them with his machete.    He was tried by a military court for bearing arms against the government,  and sentenced to be shot by a fusillade some morning before sunrise.    Previous to execution he was confined in the military prison of Santa  Clara with thirty other insurgents, all of whom were sentenced to be  shot, one after the other, on mornings following the execution of  Rodriguez.    His execution took place the morning of the 19th of January, 1897, at a  place a half-mile distant from the city, on the great plain that  stretches from the forts out to the hills, beyond which Rodriguez had  lived for nineteen years.  At the time of his death he was twenty years  old.    I witnessed his execution, and what follows is an account of the way he  went to his death.  The young man's friends could not be present, for it  was impossible for them to show themselves in that crowd and that place  with wisdom or without distress, and I like to think that, although  Rodriguez could not know it, there was one person present when he died  who felt keenly for him, and who was a sympathetic though unwilling  spectator.    There had been a full moon the night preceding the execution, and when  the squad of soldiers marched from town it was still shining brightly  through the mists.  It lighted a plain two miles in extent, broken by  ridges and gullies and covered with thick, high grass, and with bunches  of cactus and palmetto.  In the hollow of the ridges the mist lay like  broad lakes of water, and on one side of the plain stood the walls of the  old town.  On the other rose hills covered with royal palms that showed  white in the moonlight, like hundreds of marble columns.  A line of tiny  camp-fires that the sentries had built during the night stretched between  the forts at regular intervals and burned clearly.    But as the light grew stronger and the moonlight faded these were stamped  out, and when the soldiers came in force the moon was a white ball in the  sky, without radiance, the fires had sunk to ashes, and the sun had not  yet risen.    So even when the men were formed into three sides of a hollow square,  they were scarcely able to distinguish one another in the uncertain light  of the morning.    There were about three hundred soldiers in the formation.  They belonged  to the volunteers, and they deployed upon the plain with their band in  front playing a jaunty quickstep, while their officers galloped from one  side to the other through the grass, seeking a suitable place for the  execution.  Outside the line the band still played merrily.    A few men and boys, who had been dragged out of their beds by the music,  moved about the ridges behind the soldiers, half-clothed, unshaven,  sleepy-eyed, yawning, stretching themselves nervously and shivering in  the cool, damp air of the morning.    Either owing to discipline or on account of the nature of their errand,  or because the men were still but half awake, there was no talking in the  ranks, and the soldiers stood motionless, leaning on their rifles, with  their backs turned to the town, looking out across the plain to the  hills.    The men in the crowd behind them were also grimly silent.  They knew that  whatever they might say would be twisted into a word of sympathy for the  condemned man or a protest against the government.  So no one spoke; even  the officers gave their orders in gruff whispers, and the men in the  crowd did not mix together, but looked suspiciously at one another and  kept apart.    As the light increased a mass of people came hurrying from the town with  two black figures leading them, and the soldiers drew up at attention,  and part of the double line fell back and left an opening in the square.    With us a condemned man walks only the short distance from his cell to  the scaffold or the electric chair, shielded from sight by the prison  walls, and it often occurs even then that the short journey is too much  for his strength and courage.    But the Spaniards on this morning made the prisoner walk for over a  half-mile across the broken surface of the fields.  I expected to find  the man, no matter what his strength at other times might be, stumbling  and faltering on this cruel journey; but as he came nearer I saw that he  led all the others, that the priests on either side of him were taking  two steps to his one, and that they were tripping on their gowns and  stumbling over the hollows in their efforts to keep pace with him as he  walked, erect and soldierly, at a quick step in advance of them.    He had a handsome, gentle face of the peasant type, a light, pointed  beard, great wistful eyes, and a mass of curly black hair.  He was  shockingly young for such a sacrifice, and looked more like a Neapolitan  than a Cuban.  You could imagine him sitting on the quay at Naples or  Genoa lolling in the sun and showing his white teeth when he laughed.  Around his neck, hanging outside his linen blouse, he wore a new  scapular.    It seems a petty thing to have been pleased with at such a time, but I  confess to have felt a thrill of satisfaction when I saw, as the Cuban  passed me, that he held a cigarette between his lips, not arrogantly nor  with bravado, but with the nonchalance of a man who meets his punishment  fearlessly, and who will let his enemies see that they can kill but  cannot frighten him.    It was very quickly finished, with rough and, but for one frightful  blunder, with merciful swiftness.  The crowd fell back when it came to  the square, and the condemned man, the priests, and the firing squad of  six young volunteers passed in and the line closed behind them.    The officer who had held the cord that bound the Cuban's arms behind him  and passed across his breast, let it fall on the grass and drew his  sword, and Rodriguez dropped his cigarette from his lips and bent and  kissed the cross which the priest held up before him.    The elder of the priests moved to one side and prayed rapidly in a loud  whisper, while the other, a younger man, walked behind the firing squad  and covered his face with his hands.  They had both spent the last twelve  hours with Rodriguez in the chapel of the prison.    The Cuban walked to where the officer directed him to stand, and turning  his back on the square, faced the hills and the road across them, which  led to his father's farm.    As the officer gave the first command he straightened himself as far as  the cords would allow, and held up his head and fixed his eyes immovably  on the morning light, which had just begun to show above the hills.    He made a picture of such pathetic helplessness, but of such courage and  dignity, that he reminded me on the instant of that statue of Nathan Hale  which stands in the City Hall Park, above the roar of Broadway.  The  Cuban's arms were bound, as are those of the statue, and he stood firmly,  with his weight resting on his heels like a soldier on parade, and with  his face held up fearlessly, as is that of the statue.  But there was  this difference, that Rodriguez, while probably as willing to give six  lives for his country as was the American rebel, being only a peasant,  did not think to say so, and he will not, in consequence, live in bronze  during the lives of many men, but will be remembered only as one of  thirty Cubans, one of whom was shot at Santa Clara on each succeeding day  at sunrise.    The officer had given the order, the men had raised their pieces, and the  condemned man had heard the clicks of the triggers as they were pulled  back, and he had not moved.  And then happened one of the most cruelly  refined, though unintentional, acts of torture that one can very well  imagine.  As the officer slowly raised his sword, preparatory to giving  the signal, one of the mounted officers rode up to him and pointed out  silently that, as I had already observed with some satisfaction, the  firing squad were so placed that when they fired they would shoot several  of the soldiers stationed on the extreme end of the square.    Their captain motioned his men to lower their pieces, and then walked  across the grass and laid his hand on the shoulder of the waiting  prisoner.    It is not pleasant to think what that"]]]
