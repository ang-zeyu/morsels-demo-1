[A] Vasco da Gama.          PREFACE.      I have been asked to write a story of Ferdinand Magellan, the value of  whose discoveries has received a new interpretation in the development  of the South Temperate Zone of America, and in the ceding of the  Philippine Islands to the United States. The works of Lord Stanley and  of Guillemard furnish comprehensive histories of the intrepid discoverer  of the South Pacific Ocean and the Philippine Islands; but there would  seem to be room for a short, picturesque story of Magellan's adventures,  such as might be read by family lamps and in schools.    To attempt to write such a story is more than a pleasure, for the study  of Magellan reveals a character high above his age; a man unselfish and  true, who was filled with a passion for discovery, and who sought the  welfare of humanity and the glory of the Cross rather than wealth or  fame. Among great discoverers he has left a character well-nigh ideal.  The incidents of his life are not only honorable, but usually have the  color of chivalry.    His voyages, as pictured by his companion Pigafetta, the historian, give  us our first view of the interesting native inhabitants of the South  Temperate Zone and of the Pacific archipelagoes, and his adventures with  the giants of Patagonia and with the natives of the Ladrone Islands,  read almost like stories of Sinbad the Sailor. The simple record of his  adventures is in itself a storybook.    Magellan, from his usually high and unselfish character, as well as for  the lasting influence of what he did as shown in the new developments of  civilization, merits a place among household heroes; and it is in this  purpose and spirit I have undertaken a simple sympathetic interpretation  of his most noble and fruitful life. I have tried to put into the form  of a story the events whose harvests now appear after nearly four  hundred years, and to picture truthfully a beautiful and inspiring  character. To the narrative of his lone lantern I have added some tales  of the Philippines.                                                          H.

CHAPTER I.    A STRANGE ROYAL ORDER.      I am to tell the story of a man who had faith in himself.    The clouds and the ocean bear his name. Lord Stanley has called him \"the  greatest of ancient and modern navigators.\"    That was a strange royal order, indeed, which Dom Manoel, King of  Portugal, issued in the early part of the fifteenth century. It was in  effect: \"Go to the house of Hernando de Magallanes, in Sabrosa, and tear  from it the coat of arms. Hernando de Magallanes (Ferdinand Magellan)  has transferred his allegiance to the King of Spain.\"    The people of the mountain district must have been very much astonished  when the cavaliers, if such they were, appeared to execute this order.    As the arms were torn away from the ancient house, we may imagine the  alcalde of the place inquiring:    \"What has our townsman done? Did he not serve our country well in the  East?\"    \"He is a renegade!\" answers the commander.    \"But he carried his plans for discovery to our own King first before he  went to the court of Spain.\"    \"Say no more!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37823"],[0,"Neotropical Hylid Frogs, Genus Smilisca (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                      UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS    MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY        Volume 17, No. 7, pp. 281-375, pls. 1-12, 17 figs.

Most genera (30) and about 350 species  live in the American tropics. _Hyla_ and 10 other genera inhabit Central  America; four of those 10 genera (_Gastrotheca_, _Hemiphractus_,  _Phrynohyas_, and _Phyllomedusa_) are widely distributed in South  America. The other six genera are either restricted to Central America  or have their greatest differentiation there. _Plectrohyla_ and  _Ptychohyla_ inhabit streams in the highlands of southern Mexico and  northern Central America; _Diaglena_ and _Triprion_ are casque-headed  inhabitants of arid regions in Mexico and northern Central America.  _Anotheca_ is a tree-hole breeder in cloud forests in Middle America.  The genus _Smilisca_ is the most widespread geographically and diverse  ecologically of the Central American genera.    The definition of genera in the family Hylidae is difficult owing to the  vast array of species, most of which are poorly known as regards their  osteology, colors in life, and modes of life history. The genera  _Diaglena_, _Triprion_, _Tetraprion_, _Osteocephalus_, _Trachycephalus_,  _Aparasphenodon_, _Corythomantis_, _Hemiphractus_, _Pternohyla_, and  _Anotheca_ have been recognized as distinct from one another and from  the genus _Hyla_ on the basis of various modifications of dermal bones  of the cranium. _Phyllomedusa_ is recognized on the basis of a vertical  pupil and opposable thumb; _Plectrohyla_ is characterized by the  presence of a bony prepollex and the absence of a quadratojugal.  _Gastrotheca_ is distinguished from other hylids by the presence of a  pouch in the back of females. A pair of lateral vocal sacs behind the  angles of the jaws and the well-developed dermal glands were used by  Duellman (1956) to distinguish _Phrynohyas_ from _Hyla_. He (1963a)  cited the ventrolateral glands in breeding males as diagnostic of  _Ptychohyla_. Some species groups within the vaguely defined genus  _Hyla_ have equally distinctive characters. The _Hyla septentrionalis_  group is characterized by a casque-head, not much different from that in  the genus _Osteocephalus_ (Trueb, MS). Males in the _Hyla maxima_ group  have a protruding bony prepollex like that characteristically found in  _Plectrohyla_.    Ontogenetic development, osteology, breeding call, behavior, and ecology  are important in the recognition of species. By utilizing the  combination of many morphological and biological factors, the genus  _Smilisca_ can be defined reasonably well as a natural, phyletic  assemblage of species. Because the wealth of data pertaining to the  morphology and biology of _Smilisca_ is lacking for most other tree  frogs in Middle America it is not possible at present to compare  _Smilisca_ with related groups in more than a general way.    _Smilisca_ is an excellent example of an Autochthonous Middle American  genus. As defined by Stuart (1950) the Autochthonous Middle American  fauna originated from \"hanging relicts\" left in Central America by the  ancestral fauna that moved into South America and differentiated there  at a time when South America was isolated from North and Middle America.  The genus _Smilisca_, as we define it, consists of six species, all of  which occur in Central America. One species ranges northward to southern  Texas, and one extends southward on the Pacific lowlands of South  America to Ecuador. We consider the genus _Smilisca_ to be composed of  rather generalized hylids. Consequently, an understanding of the  systematics and zoogeography of the genus can be expected to be of aid  in studying more specialized members of the family.      Acknowledgments    Examination of many of the specimens used in our study was possible only  because of the cooperation of the curators of many systematic  collections. For lending specimens or providing working space in their  respective institutions we are grateful to Doris M. Cochran, Alice G. C.  Grandison, Jean Guibe, Robert F. Inger, Guenther Peters, Gerald Raun,  William J. Riemer, Jay M. Savage, Hobart M. Smith, Wilmer W. Tanner,  Charles F. Walker, Ernest E. Williams, and Richard G. Zweifel.    We are indebted to Charles J. Cole and Charles W. Myers for able  assistance in the field. The cooperation of Martin H. Moynihan at Barro  Colorado Island, Charles M. Keenan of Corozal, Canal Zone, and Robert  Hunter of San Jose, Costa Rica, is gratefully acknowledged. Jay M.  Savage turned over to us many Costa Rican specimens and aided greatly in  our work in Costa Rica. James A. Peters helped us locate sites of  collections in Ecuador and Coleman J. Goin provided a list of localities  for the genus in Colombia.    We especially thank Charles J. Cole for contributing the information on  the chromosomes, and Robert R. Patterson for preparing osteological  specimens. We thank M. J. Fouquette, Jr., who read the section on  breeding calls and offered constructive criticism.    Permits for collecting were generously provided by Ing. Rodolfo  Hernandez Corzo in Mexico, Sr. Jorge A. Ibarra in Guatemala, and Ing.  Milton Lopez in Costa Rica.
