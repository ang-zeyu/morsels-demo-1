NEW-YORK, APRIL 1, 1852. No. IV.          WILLIAM GILMORE SIMMS, LL.D.    [Illustration]      A steadily growing reputation for almost twenty years, justified by the  gradually increasing evidence of those latent, exhaustless,  ever-unfolding energies which belong to genius, has inwoven the name of  Simms with the literature of America, and made it part of the heirloom  which our age will give to posterity. Asking and desiring nothing to  which he could not prove himself justly entitled, he has wrested a  reputation from difficulty and obstacle, and conquered an honorable  acknowledgment from opposition and indifference. Even if we had not  proofs of genius in the treasury of thought and imagination constituted  by his writings, still the nobility of the example of energy,  perseverance, and high-toned hopefulness, which he has given, would  deserve a grateful homage.    William Gilmore Simms is the second, and only surviving, of three  brothers, sons of William Gilmore Simms, and Harriet Ann Augusta  Singleton. His father was of a Scotch-Irish family, and his mother of a  Virginia stock, her grandparents having removed to South Carolina long  before the Revolution, in which they took an active part on the Whig  side. He was born on the 17th of April, 1806. His mother died when he  was an infant. His father, failing in business as a merchant, removed  first to Tennessee, and then to Mississippi. While in Tennessee he  volunteered and held a commission in the army of Jackson (in Coffee's  brigade of mounted men), which scourged the Creeks and Seminoles after  the massacre of Fort Mims. Our author, left to the care of a  grandmother, remained in Charleston, where he received an education  which circumstances rendered exceedingly limited. He was denied a  classical training, but such characters stand little in need of the  ordinary aids of the schoolmaster, and, with indomitable application, he  has not only stored his mind with the richest literature, but has  received an unsolicited tribute to his diligence and acquisitions, in  the degree of Doctor of Laws, conferred upon him by the respectable  University of Alabama.    At first it was designed that he should study medicine, but his  inclination led him to the law. He was admitted to the bar of South  Carolina when twenty-one, practised for a brief period, and became part  proprietor of a daily newspaper, which, taking ground against  nullification, ruined him--swallowing up a small maternal property, and  involving him in a heavy debt which hung upon and embarrassed him for a  long time after. In 1832, he first visited the North, where he published  Atalantis. Martin Faber followed in 1834, and periodically the long  catalogue of his subsequent performances.    There are few writers who have exhibited such versatility of powers,  combined with vigor, originality of copious and independent ideas, and  that faculty of condensation which frequently by a single pregnant line  suggests an expansive train of reflection. As a poet, he unites high  imaginative powers with metaphysical thought--by which we mean that  large discourse of reason which generalizes, and which seizes the  universal, and perceives its relations to individual phenomena of nature  and psychology. His poems abound in appropriate, felicitous, and  original similes. His keen and fresh perception of nature, furnishes him  with beautiful pictures, the truthfulness and clearness of which are  admirably presented in the lucid language with which they are painted,  and, in his expression of deep personal feelings, we find a noble union  of sad emotion and manliness of tone. He draws from a full treasury of  varied experience, active thought, close observation, just and original  reflection, and a spirit which has drank deeply and lovingly from the  gushing founts of nature. His inspiration is often kindled by the sunny  and luxuriant scenery of the beautiful region to which he was born, and  besides the freshness and glow which this imparts to his descriptive  poetry, it makes him emphatically the poet of the South. Not only has he  sung her peculiar natural aspects with the appreciation of a poet and  the feeling of a son, but he has a claim to her gratitude for having  enshrined in melodious verse her ancient and fading traditions.    Mr. Simms commenced writing verses at a very early period. At eight  years of age he rhymed the achievements of the American navy in the last  war with Great Britain. At fifteen, he was a scribbler of fugitive verse  for the newspapers, and before he was twenty-one he had published two  collections of miscellaneous poetry, which his better taste and prudence  subsequently induced him to suppress. Two other volumes of poems  followed, in a more ambitious vein, which are also now beyond the reach  of the collector, and were issued while he was engaged in the  occupations of a newspaper editor and a student and practitioner of law.  These volumes were followed by Atalantis, a poem which has been highly  praised by the best critics of our time.    As a prose writer, his vigorous, copious, and original ideas are clothed  in a manly, flexible, pure, and lucid style. His first production,  Martin Faber, succeeded Atalantis. It was the initial of a series of  tales, which we may describe as of the metaphysical and passionate or  moral imaginative class. These, with two or more volumes of shorter  tales, are numerous, and perhaps among the most original of his  writings. They comprise Martin Faber and other Tales, Castle Dismal,  Confessions, or the Blind Heart, Carle Werner and other Tales, and the  Wigwam and Cabin. There are other compositions belonging to this  category, and, it may be, not inferior in merit to any of these, which  have appeared in periodicals and annuals, but have not yet been  collected by their author.    The first novel of Mr. Simms belonged to our border and domestic  history. This was Guy Rivers; and to the same class he has contributed  largely, in Richard Hurdis, Border Beagles, Beauchampe, Helen Halsey,  and other productions. In historical romance, he has written The  Yemassee, the Damsel of Darien, Pelayo, and Count Julian, each in two  volumes. The scenes of the two last are laid in Europe. His romances  founded on our revolutionary history, are The Partisan, Mellichampe, and  The Kinsmen. In biography and history, he is the author of The Life of  Marion; The Life of Captain John Smith, founder of Virginia; a History  of South Carolina; a Geography of the same State; a Life of Bayard; and  a Life of General Greene.    It is impossible to enumerate accurately his poetical productions, as  many, published in periodicals, have never been printed together; but  the collection of his poems now in course of publication at Charleston,  will supply a desideratum to the lovers of genuine American letters and  art. Atalantis, Southern Passages and Pictures, Donna Florida, Grouped  Thoughts and Scattered Fancies, Areytos, Lays of the Palmetto, The  Cassique of Accube and other Poems, Norman Maurice, and The City of the  Silent, constituting distinct volumes, are, however, well known.    The orations of Mr. Simms, which have been published, comprise one  delivered before the Erosophic Society of the Alabama University,  entitled, The Social Principle--the true source of National Permanence;  another before the town council and citizens of Aiken, South Carolina,  on the Fourth of July, 1844, entitled, The Sources of American  Independence; and one delivered before literary societies in Georgia,  entitled Self-development.    As a writer of criticism, Mr. Simms is known by numerous articles  contributed to periodicals; by a review of Mrs. Trolloppe, in the  American Quarterly, and of Miss Martineau in the Southern Literary  Messenger (both subsequently republished in pamphlets, and received with  general approval), as well as by many others of equal merit--a selection  from which, wholly devoted to American topics, has been published in two  volumes, under the title of Views and Reviews in American History and  Fiction.    Scarcely a production of Mr. Simms has been unmarked by a cordial  reception from the best literary journals; and the praise of the London  _Metropolitan_ and _Examiner_--the former when under the conduct of  Thomas Campbell, the latter of Albany Fonblanque--was generously  bestowed, especially on _Atalantis_; of which the _Metropolitan_ said,  \"What has the most disappointed us is, that it is so thoroughly English:  the construction, the imagery, and, with a very few exceptions, the  idioms of the language, are altogether founded on our own scholastic and  classical models;\" and Fonblanque, in reviewing a tale by Simms,  entitled, _Murder will Out_, said, \"But all we intended to say about the  originality displayed in the volume has been forgotten in the interest  of the last story of the book, _Murder will Out_. This is an American  ghost story, and, without exception, the best we ever read. Within our  limits, we could not, with any justice, describe the whole course of its  incident, and it is in that, perhaps, its most marvellous effect lies.  It is the _rationale_ of the whole matter of such appearances, given  with fine philosophy and masterly interest. We never read any thing more  perfect or more consummately told.\"    But the testimony of the critical press, or even of the successful sale  of an author's works, is not so suggestive of merit as the fact that his  productions have entered into the popular mind; and this tribute Mr.  Simms has received in the fact that in regions which he has identified  with legends created for them by his own genius, localities of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3535"],[0,"A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany-Bay (#1)"],[1,"whitespace; small checks; poetry; italics; dashes; gut;        A NARRATIVE OF THE EXPEDITION TO BOTANY BAY      by Watkin Tench          INTRODUCTION        In offering this little tract to the public, it is equally the writer's  wish to conduce to their amusement and information.    The expedition on which he is engaged has excited much curiosity, and  given birth to many speculations, respecting the consequences to arise  from it. While men continue to think freely, they will judge variously.  Some have been sanguine enough to foresee the most beneficial effects to  the Parent State, from the Colony we are endeavouring to establish;  and some have not been wanting to pronounce the scheme big with folly,  impolicy, and ruin. Which of these predictions will be completed, I  leave to the decision of the public. I cannot, however, dismiss the  subject without expressing a hope, that the candid and liberal of each  opinion, induced by the humane and benevolent intention in which it  originated, will unite in waiting the result of a fair trial to an  experiment, no less new in its design, than difficult in its execution.    As this publication enters the world with the name of the author,  candour will, he trusts, induce its readers to believe, that no  consideration could weigh with him in an endeavour to mislead them.  Facts are related simply as they happened, and when opinions are  hazarded, they are such as, he hopes, patient inquiry, and deliberate  decision, will be found to have authorised. For the most part he has  spoken from actual observation; and in those places where the relations  of others have been unavoidably adopted. He has been careful to search  for the truth, and repress that spirit of exaggeration which is almost  ever the effect of novelty on ignorance.    The nautical part of the work is comprized in as few pages as possible.  By the professional part of my readers this will be deemed judicious;  and the rest will not, I believe, be dissatisfied at its brevity. I beg  leave, however, to say of the astronomical calculations, that they  may be depended on with the greatest degree of security, as they were  communicated by an officer, who was furnished with instruments, and  commissioned by the Board of Longitude, to make observations during the  voyage, and in the southern hemisphere.    An unpractised writer is generally anxious to bespeak public attention,  and to solicit public indulgence. Except on professional subjects,  military men are, perhaps, too fearful of critical censure. For the  present narrative no other apology is attempted, than the intentions of  its author, who has endeavoured not only to satisfy present curiosity,  but to point out to future adventurers, the favourable, as well as  adverse circumstances which will attend their settling here. The candid,  it is hoped, will overlook the inaccuracies of this imperfect sketch,  drawn amidst the complicated duties of the service in which the Author  is engaged, and make due allowance for the want of opportunity of  gaining more extensive information.    Watkin Tench, Capt. of the Marines.    Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, New South Wales, 10 July, 1788.            CHAPTER I        From the Embarkation of the Convicts, to the Departure of the Ships from  England.      The marines and convicts having been previously embarked in the River,  at Portsmouth, and Plymouth, the whole fleet destined for the expedition  rendezvoused at the Mother Bank, on the 16th of March 1787, and remained  there until the 13th of May following. In this period, excepting a  slight appearance of contagion in one of the transports, the ships were  universally healthy, and the prisoners in high spirits. Few complaints  or lamentations were to be heard among them, and an ardent wish for the  hour of departure seemed generally to prevail.    As the reputation, equally with the safety of the officers and  soldiers appointed to guard the convicts, consisted in maintaining due  subordination, an opportunity was taken, immediately on their being  embarked, to convince them, in the most pointed terms, that any attempt  on their side, either to contest the command, or to force their escape,  should be punished with instant death; orders to this effect were given  to the centinels in their presence; happily, however, for all parties,  there occurred not any instance in which there was occasion to have  recourse to so desperate a measure; the behavior of the convicts being  in general humble, submissive, and regular: indeed I should feel myself  wanting in justice to those unfortunate men, were I not to bear this  public testimony of the sobriety and decency of their conduct.    Unpleasant as a state of inactivity and delay for many weeks appeared  to us, it was not without its advantages; for by means of it we were  enabled to establish necessary regulations among the convicts, and to  adopt such a system of defence, as left us little to Apprehend for our  own security, in case a spirit of madness and desperation had hurried  them on to attempt our destruction.    Among many other troublesome parts of duty which the service we were  engaged on required, the inspection of all letters brought to, or sent  from the ships, was not one of the least tiresome and disagreeable. The  number and contents of those in the vessel I was embarked in, frequently  surprised me very much; they varied according to the dispositions of  the writers: but their constant language was, an apprehension of the  impracticability of returning home, the dread of a sickly passage,  and the fearful prospect of a distant and barbarous country. But this  apparent despondency proceeded in few instances from sentiment. With too  many it was, doubtless, an artifice to awaken compassion, and call forth  relief; the correspondence invariably ending in a petition for money  and tobacco. Perhaps a want of the latter, which is considered a great  luxury by its admirers among the lower classes of life, might be the  more severely felt, from their being debarred in all cases whatever,  sickness excepted, the use of spirituous liquors.    It may be thought proper for me to mention, that during our stay at the  Mother Bank, the soldiers and convicts were indiscriminately served  with fresh beef. The former, in addition, had the usual quantity of beer  allowed in the navy, and were at what is called full allowance of all  species of provisions; the latter, at two thirds only.          CHAPTER II.        From the Departure, to the Arrival of the Fleet at Teneriffe.      Governor Phillip having at length reached Portsmouth, and all things  deemed necessary for the expedition being put on board, at daylight  on the morning of the 13th, the signal to weigh anchor was made in the  Commanding Officer's ship the Sirius. Before six o'clock the whole  fleet were under sail; and, the weather being fine and wind easterly,  proceeded through the Needles with a fresh leading breeze. In addition  to our little armament, the Hyena frigate was ordered to accompany us  a certain distance to the westward, by which means our number was  increased to twelve sail: His Majesty's ships 'Sirius', 'Hyena', and  'Supply', three Victuallers with two years stores and provisions on  board for the Settlement, and six Transports, with troops and convicts.  In the transports were embarked four captains, twelve subalterns,  twenty-four serjeants and corporals, eight drummers, and one hundred and  sixty private marines, making the whole of the military force, including  the Major Commandant and Staff on board the Sirius, to consist of two  hundred and twelve persons, of whom two hundred and ten were volunteers.  The number of convicts was five hundred and sixty-five men, one hundred  and ninety-two women, and eighteen children; the major part of the  prisoners were mechanics and husbandmen, selected on purpose by order of  Government.    By ten o'clock we had got clear of the Isle of Wight, at which time,  having very little pleasure in conversing with my own thoughts, I  strolled down among the convicts, to observe their sentiments at this  juncture. A very few excepted, their countenances indicated a high  degree of satisfaction, though in some, the pang of being severed,  perhaps for ever, from their native land, could not be wholly  suppressed; in general, marks of distress were more perceptible among  the men than the women; for I recollect to have seen but one of those  affected on the occasion, \"Some natural tears she dropp'd, but wip'd  them soon.\" After this the accent of sorrow was no longer heard; more  genial skies and change of scene banished repining and discontent, and  introduced in their stead cheerfulness and acquiescence in a lot, now  not to be altered.    To add to the good disposition which was beginning to manifest  itself, on the morning of the 20th, in consequence of some favorable  representations made by the officers commanding detachments, they were  hailed and told from the Sirius, that in those cases where they judged  it proper, they were at liberty to release the convicts from the fetters  in which they had been hitherto confined. In complying with these  directions, I had great pleasure in being able to extend this humane  order to the whole of those under my charge, without a single exception.  It is hardly necessary for me to say, that the precaution of ironing the  convicts at any time reached to the men only.    In the evening of the same day, the Hyena left us for England, which  afforded an early opportunity of writing to our friends, and easing  their apprehensions by a communication of the favourable accounts it was  in our power to send them.    From this time to the day of our making the land, little occurred worthy  of remark. I cannot, however, help noticing the propriety of employing  the marines on a service which requires activity and exertion at sea, in  preference to other troops. Had a"]]]
