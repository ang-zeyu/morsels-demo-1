Scattered from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico and from the  Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean are thousands of trappers who use  deadfalls, snares and other home-made traps, but within this vast  territory there are many thousand who know little or nothing of them.    The best and most successful trappers are those of extended  experience. Building deadfalls and constructing snares, as told on  the following pages, will be of value to trappers located where  material--saplings, poles, boards, rocks, etc.--is to be had for  constructing. The many traps described cannot all be used to  advantage in any section, but some of them can.    More than sixty illustrations are used to enable the beginner to  better understand the constructing and workings of home-made traps.  The illustrations are mainly furnished by the \"old timers.\"    Chapters on Skinning and Stretching, Handling and Grading are added  for the correct handling of skins and furs adds largely to their  commercial value.    A. R. Harding.        DEADFALLS AND SNARES        CHAPTER I.    BUILDING DEADFALLS.    During the centuries that trapping has been carried on, not only in  America, but thruout the entire world, various kinds of traps and  snares have been in use and taken by all classes of trappers and in  all sections the home-made traps are of great numbers. The number of  furs caught each year is large.    The above was said by a trapper some years ago who has spent upwards  of forty years in the forests and is well acquainted with traps,  trappers and fur-bearing animals. Whether the statement is true or  not, matters but little, altho one thing is certain and that is that  many of the men who have spent years in trapping and have been  successful use the deadfalls and snares as well as steel traps.    Another trapper says: In my opinion trapping is an art and any  trapper that is not able to make and set a deadfall, when occasion  demands, does not belong to the profession. I will give a few of the  many reasons why dead falls are good.    1. There is no weight to carry.    2. Many of the best trappers use them.    3. It requires no capital to set a line of deadfalls.    4. There is no loss of traps by trap thieves, but the fur is in as  much danger.    5. Deadfalls do not mangle animals or injure their fur.    6. It is a humane way of killing animals.    7. There is no loss by animals twisting off a foot or leg and getting  away.    8. Animals are killed outright, having no chance to warn others of  their kind by their cries from being caught.    9. Trappers always have the necessary outfit (axe and knife) with  them to make and set a deadfall that will kill the largest animals.    10. The largest deadfalls can be made to spring easy and catch small  game if required.    11. Deadfalls will kill skunk without leaving any scent.    12. Deadfalls are cheap and trappers should be familiar with them.    It is a safe proposition, however, that not one-half of the trappers  of today can build a deadfall properly or know how to make snares,  and many of them have not so much as seen one.    First a little pen about a foot square is built of stones, chunks, or  by driving stakes close together, leaving one side open. The stakes  should be cut about thirty inches long and driven into the ground  some fourteen inches, leaving sixteen or thereabout above the ground.  Of course if the earth is very solid, stakes need not be so long, but  should be so driven that only about sixteen inches remain above  ground. A sapling say four inches in diameter and four feet long is  laid across the end that is open. A sapling that is four, five or six  inches in diameter, owing to what you are trapping for, and about  twelve feet long, is now cut for the \"fall.\" Stakes are set so that  this pole or fall will play over the short pole on the ground. These  stakes should be driven in pairs; two about eighteen inches from the  end; two about fourteen farther back. (See illustration.)      [Illustration: THE POLE DEADFALL.]    The small end of the pole should be split and a small but stout stake  driven firmly thru it so there will be no danger of the pole turning  and \"going off\" of its own accord. The trap is set by placing the  prop (which is only seven inches in length and half an inch thru)  between the top log and the short one on the ground, to which is  attached the long trigger, which is only a stick about the size of  the prop, but about twice as long, the baited end of which extends  back into the little pen.    The bait may consist of a piece of chicken, rabbit or any tough bit  of meat so long as it is fresh and the bloodier the better. An animal  on scenting the bait will reach into the trap--the top of the pen  having been carefully covered over--between the logs. When the animal  seizes the bait the long trigger is pulled off of the upright prop  and down comes the fall, killing the animal by its weight. Skunk,  coon, opossum, mink and in fact nearly all kinds of animals are  easily caught in this trap. The fox is an exception, as it is rather  hard to catch them in deadfalls.    The more care that you take to build the pen tight and strong, the  less liable is some animal to tear it down and get bait from the  outside; also if you will cover the pen with leaves, grass, sticks,  etc., animals will not be so shy of the trap. The triggers are very  simple, the long one being placed on top of the upright, or short  one. The long triggers should have a short prong left or a nail  driven in it to prevent the game from getting the bait off too easy.  If you find it hard to get saplings the right size for a fall, and  are too light, they can be weighted with a pole laid on the \"fall.\"      [Illustration: SMALL ANIMAL FALL.]    I will try and give directions and drawing of deadfalls which I have  used to some extent for years, writes a Maine trapper, and can say  that most all animals can be captured in them as shown in  illustration. You will see the deadfall is constructed of stakes and  rocks and is made as follows: Select a place where there is game; you  need an axe, some nails, also strong string, a pole four inches or  more in diameter. Notice the cut No. 1 being the drop pole which  should be about six to seven feet long. No. 2 is the trip stick, No.  3 is string tied to pole and trip stick, No. 4 is the stakes for  holding up the weight, No. 5 is the small stakes driven around in the  shape of letter U, should be one foot wide and two feet long. No. 6  is the rocks, No. 7 is the bait.    Now this is a great trap for taking skunk and is soon built where  there are small saplings and rocks. This trap is also used for mink  and coon.      * * *    The trapper's success depends entirely upon his skill and no one can  expect the best returns unless his work is skillfully done. Do not  Attempt to make that deadfall unless you are certain that you can  make it right and do not leave it till you are certain that it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34131"],[0,"Butterflies and Moths (British) (#1)"],[1,"Team (http://www.pgdp.net) from page images generously made  available by Internet Archive (http://www.archive.org)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

And New York. 15 East 16th Street  1894    All rights reserved          PREFACE      The favourable reception with which the 'Out-door World' has been  greeted has encouraged the publishers to issue a series of volumes  dealing in fuller detail with the various branches of Natural History  treated of in that work. Necessarily each subject was only briefly  touched upon, but the study is of so enticing a character that 'appetite  grows by feeding,' and the students of the 'Out-door World,' having  tasted the sweetness of companionship with Nature, will not rest  satisfied with the help afforded by that handbook. Each one will want to  go deeper into that particular department which most appeals to his own  inclinations.    The present volume is written expressly for those who desire to extend  their knowledge of the British Lepidoptera, or, to use the more popular  names, 'Butterflies and Moths.'    The general characteristics of this interesting order of insects are  described somewhat fully, but, of course, it would be impossible to give  an individual account of all the British Lepidoptera in a work of this  size, so a selection has been made such as will satisfy the requirements  of the great majority of those who intend to take up this particular  branch of entomology. The number of British Butterflies, however, is  so limited that a place has been found for a figure and a description of  every species; and, of the larger moths, many of the common and typical  kinds have been included. An introduction to the study of the  Micro-lepidoptera has also been added.    No trouble has been spared to render this work thoroughly practical. In  addition to the verbal descriptions of so many species, twelve coloured  plates and a large number of woodcuts have been specially prepared to  help the student in his work. It is believed that the extreme care with  which these have been produced will render them of the greatest  assistance to the collector in the recognition of his specimens.    But he has not only to recognise his specimens--he must first catch  them; and here full directions have been given to insure success in this  part of his work, as well as in the management, preservation, and  arrangement of his captures.    The Author hopes that this volume may be the means of adding many happy  hours--hours of the purest enjoyment--to the lives of those whom he has  succeeded in luring into the fields and lanes and woods of the Out-door  World.
