Its author  was born of obscure parentage in 1827, and, after a life passed  in not much less obscurity, died in 1879. The ten years which were  devoted to the composition of \"The Legend of Tyl Ulenspiegel\" were  devoted to what proved, for de Coster, little more than a labour of  love. Recognition came to him but from the few, and it was not till  some thirty years after his death that an official monument was raised  at Brussels to his memory, and an official oration delivered in his  praise by Camille Lemonnier.    To the undiscerning among his contemporaries de Coster may have  appeared little else than a rather eccentric journalist with  archaeological tastes. For a time, indeed, he held a post on the  Royal Commission which was appointed in 1860 to investigate and  publish old Flemish laws. And towards the end of his life he became  a Professor of History and French Literature at the Military School  in Brussels. Never, certainly, has a work of imagination, planned  on an epic scale, been composed with a closer regard for historical  detail than this Legend. But if our present age is less likely to be  held by this than by those other qualities in the book of vitality  and passion, it can only be that de Coster poured into his work not  merely the knowledge and accuracy of an historian, but the love as  well and the ardour of a poet and a patriot.    The objection--if it be an objection--that de Coster borrowed  unblushingly from his predecessors need never be disputed. His style  is frankly Rabelaisian. The stage whereon his actors play their parts  is set, scene almost for scene, from the generally available documents  that served such a writer as Thomas Motley for his \"History of the  Rise of the Dutch Republic.\" Even the name, the very lineaments  of Ulenspiegel, are borrowed from that familiar figure of the  sixteenth-century chap-books [1] whose jolly pranks and schoolboy  frolics have been crystallized in the French word espieglerie,  and in our own day set to music in one of the symphonic poems of  Richard Strauss.    Yet from such well-worn ingredients de Coster's genius has mixed a  potion most individually his own. The style of Rabelais is tempered  with a finish, a neatness, and a wit that are as truly the product  of the modern spirit as was the flamboyant jollity of Rabelais  the product of his own Renaissance age; the sensible, historical  foreground of a Motley becomes the coloured background to a romantic  drama of human vice and virtue, linked in its turn to a conception  of the cosmic process which has no other home, surely, than in the  author's brain. While Ulenspiegel himself is now not simply the type  of young high spirits and animal good humour, but a being as complex,  as many-sided almost as humanity--all brightness of intellect, all  warmth of heart, all honour, and all dream--the immortal Spirit of  Flanders that knows not what it is to be beaten, whose last song must  for ever remain unsung.    What shall we say of those other homely personages who fill the  scene--symbols no less of Flemish character at its finest and of the  enduringly domestic springs of Flemish national life? Claes the trusty  fatherhood, Soetkin the valiant motherhood of Flanders, Nele her true  heart, Lamme Goedzak her great belly that hungers always for more and  yet more good things to eat and is never satisfied? Or what, again,  of the tragic Katheline, half witch, half martyr, and the centre of  that dark intrigue which seems to throb like a shuttle through the  mazy pattern of the plot, threading it all into unity?    From yet another standpoint: as an envisagement of the horrors of the  Spanish Inquisition, de Coster's work is probably without parallel  in an already well-tilled field. The sinister figure of the King of  Spain broods over it all like a Kaiser, and the episodes of stake and  torture are recorded with a realism which might appear exaggerated  had not modern Belgium--though in terms of \"scientific warfare\"--an  even more devilish tale to tell. The fact is that de Coster's trick of  stating horror and leaving it to make its full effect without a touch  of the rhetoric of indignation, proves the deadliest of all corrosive  weapons; and it is hardly surprising that the book had been hailed  in some quarters as a Protestant tract. But de Coster himself was in  no sense a theological partisan, and his sympathy with the Beggarmen  sprang from his enthusiasm for national liberty far more than from  any bias towards the Protestant cause as such. That Catholicism has  ever been identified with tyranny the best Catholic will most deplore,  nor will de Coster's \"traditional\" irreverence blind such a reader's  eyes to the spiritual generosity which permeates the whole work,  and is, indeed, its most essential characteristic.    It remains to add that, in the interests of war-time publishing,  the present version represents a curtailment of the Legend as it left  the author's hands. Here and there also, to maintain the continuity of  incident, the translator has permitted himself some slight modification  of the original text. By this means it is hoped that the proportions  of the whole have been fairly maintained, and that no vital aspect  of plot or atmosphere has been altogether suppressed or allowed an  undue prominence.      G. A. W.                HERE BEGINS THE FIRST BOOK OF THE LEGEND OF THE GLORIOUS JOYOUS AND  HEROIC ADVENTURES OF TYL ULENSPIEGEL AND LAMME GOEDZAK IN THE LAND  OF FLANDERS AND ELSEWHERE      I      At Damme, in Flanders, when the May hawthorn was coming into flower,  Ulenspiegel was born, the son of Claes.    When she had wrapped him in warm swaddling-clothes, Katheline, the  midwife, made a careful examination of the infant's head, and found  a piece of skin hanging therefrom.    \"Born with a caul!\" she cried out joyfully. \"Born under a lucky  star!\" But a moment later, noticing a small black mole on the baby's  shoulder, she fell into lamentation.    \"Alas!\" she wept, \"it is the black finger-print of the devil!\"    \"Monsieur Satan,\" said Claes, \"must have risen early this morning,  if already he has found time to set his sign upon my son!\"    \"Be sure, he never went to bed,\" answered Katheline. \"Here is  Chanticleer only just awakening the hens!\"    And so saying she went out of the room, leaving the baby in the arms  of Claes.    Then it was that the dawn came bursting through the clouds of night,  and the swallows skimmed chirruping over the fields, while the sun  began to show his dazzling face on the horizon. Claes opened the  window and thus addressed himself to Ulenspiegel.    \"O babe born with a caul, behold! Here is my Lord the Sun who comes  to make his salutation to the land of Flanders. Gaze on Him whenever  you can; and if ever in after years you come to be in any doubt or  difficulty, not knowing what is right to do, ask counsel of Him. He  is bright and He is warm. Be sincere as that brightness, and virtuous  as that warmth.\"    \"Claes, my good man,\" said Soetkin, \"you are preaching to the  deaf. Come, drink, son of mine.\"    And so saying, the mother offered to her new-born babe a draught from  nature's fountain.              II      While Ulenspiegel nestled close and drank his fill, all the birds in  the country-side began to waken.    Claes, who was tying up sticks, regarded his wife as she gave the  breast to Ulenspiegel.    \"Wife,\" he said, \"hast made good provision of this fine milk?\"    \"The pitchers are full,\" she said, \"but that doth not suffice for my  peace of mind.\"    \"It seems that you are downhearted over your good fortune,\" said Claes.    \"I was thinking,\" she said, \"that there is not so much as a penny  piece in that leather bag of ours hanging on the wall.\"    Claes took hold of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#1)"],[1,"SYBIL, OR THE TWO NATIONS    By Benjamin Disraeli      I would inscribe these volumes to one whose noble spirit and gentle  nature ever prompt her to sympathise with the suffering; to one whose  sweet voice has often encouraged, and whose taste and judgment have ever  guided, their pages; the most severe of critics, but--a perfect Wife!        Advertisement      The general reader whose attention has not been specially drawn to the  subject which these volumes aim to illustrate, the Condition of  the People, might suspect that the Writer had been tempted to some  exaggeration in the scenes which he has drawn and the impressions which  he has wished to convey. He thinks it therefore due to himself to state  that he believes there is not a trait in this work for which he has not  the authority of his own observation, or the authentic evidence which  has been received by Royal Commissions and Parliamentary Committees. But  while he hopes he has alleged nothing which is not true, he has found  the absolute necessity of suppressing much that is genuine. For so  little do we know of the state of our own country that the air of  improbability that the whole truth would inevitably throw over these  pages, might deter many from their perusal.    Grosvenor-Gate, May Day, 1845.          BOOK I          Book 1 Chapter 1      \"I'll take the odds against Caravan.\"    \"In poneys?\"    \"Done.\"    And Lord Milford, a young noble, entered in his book the bet which he  had just made with Mr Latour, a grey headed member of the Jockey Club.    It was the eve of the Derby of 1837. In a vast and golden saloon, that  in its decorations would have become, and in its splendour would not  have disgraced, Versailles in the days of the grand monarch, were  assembled many whose hearts beat at the thought of the morrow, and whose  brains still laboured to control its fortunes to their advantage.    \"They say that Caravan looks puffy,\" lisped in a low voice a young  man, lounging on the edge of a buhl table that had once belonged to a  Mortemart, and dangling a rich cane with affected indifference in order  to conceal his anxiety from all, except the person whom he addressed.    \"They are taking seven to two against him freely over the way,\" was the  reply. \"I believe it's all right.\"    \"Do you know I dreamed last night something about Mango,\" continued the  gentleman with the cane, and with a look of uneasy superstition.    His companion shook his head.    \"Well,\" continued the gentleman with the cane, \"I have no opinion of  him. I gave Charles Egremont the odds against Mango this morning; he  goes with us, you know. By the bye, who is our fourth?\"    \"I thought of Milford,\" was the reply in an under tone. \"What say you?\"    \"Milford is going with St James and Punch Hughes.\"    \"Well, let us come into supper, and we shall see some fellow we like.\"    So saying, the companions, taking their course through more than one  chamber, entered an apartment of less dimensions than the principal  saloon, but not less sumptuous in its general appearance. The gleaming  lustres poured a flood of soft yet brilliant light over a plateau  glittering with gold plate, and fragrant with exotics embedded in vases  of rare porcelain. The seats on each side of the table were occupied by  persons consuming, with a heedless air, delicacies for which they had no  appetite; while the conversation in general consisted of flying phrases  referring to the impending event of the great day that had already  dawned.    \"Come from Lady St Julian's, Fitz?\" said a youth of very tender years,  and whose fair visage was as downy and as blooming as the peach from  which with a languid air he withdrew his lips to make this inquiry of  the gentleman with the cane.    \"Yes; why were not you there?\"    \"I never go anywhere,\" replied the melancholy Cupid, \"everything bores  me so.\"    \"Well, will you go to Epsom with us to-morrow, Alfred?\" said Lord  Fitzheron. \"I take Berners and Charles Egremont, and with you our party  will be perfect.\"    \"I feel so cursed blase!\" exclaimed the boy in a tone of elegant  anguish.    \"It will give you a fillip, Alfred,\" said Mr Berners; \"do you all the  good in the world.\"    \"Nothing can do me good,\" said Alfred, throwing away his almost untasted  peach, \"I should be quite content if anything could do me harm. Waiter,  bring me a tumbler of Badminton.\"    \"And bring me one too,\" sighed out Lord Eugene De Vere, who was a  year older than Alfred Mountchesney, his companion and brother in  listlessness. Both had exhausted life in their teens, and all that  remained for them was to mourn, amid the ruins of their reminiscences,  over the extinction of excitement.    \"Well, Eugene, suppose you come with us.\" said Lord Fitzheron.    \"I think I shall go down to Hampton Court and play tennis,\" said Lord  Eugene. \"As it is the Derby, nobody will be there.\"    \"And I will go with you, Eugene,\" said Alfred Mountchesney, \"and we will  dine together afterwards at the Toy. Anything is better than dining in  this infernal London.\"    \"Well, for my part,\" said Mr Berners. \"I do not like your suburban  dinners. You always get something you can't eat, and cursed bad wine.\"    \"I rather like bad wine,\" said Mr Mountchesney; \"one gets so bored with  good wine.\"    \"Do you want the odds against Hybiscus, Berners?\" said a guardsman  looking up from his book, which he had been very intently studying.    \"All I want is some supper, and as you are not using your place--\"    \"You shall have it. Oh! here's Milford, he will give them me.\"    And at this moment entered the room the young nobleman whom we have  before mentioned, accompanied by an individual who was approaching  perhaps the termination of his fifth lustre but whose general air  rather betokened even a less experienced time of life. Tall, with  a well-proportioned figure and a graceful carriage, his countenance  touched with a sensibility that at once engages the affections. Charles  Egremont was not only admired by that sex, whose approval generally  secures men enemies among their fellows, but was at the same time the  favourite of his own.    \"Ah, Egremont! come and sit here,\" exclaimed more than one banqueter.    \"I saw you waltzing with the little Bertie, old fellow,\" said Lord  Fitzheron, \"and therefore did not stay to speak to you, as I thought we  should meet here. I am to call for you, mind.\"    \"How shall we all feel this time to-morrow?\" said Egremont, smiling.    \"The happiest fellow at this moment must be Cockie Graves,\" said Lord  Milford. \"He can have no suspense. I have been looking over his book, and  I defy him, whatever happens, not to lose.\"    \"Poor Cockie.\" said Mr Berners; \"he has asked me to dine with him at the  Clarendon on Saturday.\"    \"Cockie is a very good Cockie,\" said Lord Milford, \"and Caravan is a  very good horse; and if any gentleman sportsman present wishes to give  seven to two, I will take him to any amount.\"    \"My book is made up,\" said Egremont; \"and I stand or fall by Caravan.\"    \"And I.\"    \"And I.\"    \"And I.\"    \"Well, mark my words,\" said a fourth, rather solemnly, \"Rat-trap wins.\"    \"There is not a horse except Caravan,\" said Lord Milford, \"fit for a  borough stake.\"    \"You used to be all for Phosphorus, Egremont,\" said Lord Eugene de Vere.    \"Yes; but fortunately I have got out of that scrape. I owe Phip Dormer a  good turn for that. I was the third man who knew he had gone lame.\"    \"And what are the odds against him now.\"    \"Oh! nominal; forty to one,--what you please.\"    \"He won't run,\" said Mr Berners, \"John Day told me he had refused to  ride him.\"    \"I believe Cockie Graves might win something if Phosphorus came in  first,\" said Lord Milford, laughing.    \"How close it is to-night!\" said Egremont. \"Waiter, give me some Seltzer  water; and open another window; open them all.\"    At this moment an influx of guests intimated that the assembly at Lady  St Julian's was broken up. Many at the table rose and yielded their  places, clustering round the chimney-piece, or forming in various  groups, and discussing the great question. Several of those who had  recently entered were votaries of Rat-trap, the favourite, and quite  prepared, from all the information that had reached them, to back  their opinions valiantly. The conversation had now become general and  animated, or rather there was a medley of voices in which little was  distinguished except the names of horses and the amount of odds. In  the midst of all this, waiters glided about handing incomprehensible  mixtures bearing aristocratic names; mystical combinations of French  wines and German waters, flavoured with slices of Portugal fruits, and  cooled with lumps of American ice, compositions which immortalized the  creative genius of some high patrician name.    \"By Jove! that's a flash,\" exclaimed Lord Milford, as a blaze of  lightning seemed to suffuse the chamber, and the beaming lustres turned  white and ghastly in the glare.    The thunder rolled over the building. There was a dead silence. Was  it going to rain? Was it going to pour? Was the storm confined to the  metropolis? Would it reach Epsom? A deluge, and the course would be a  quagmire, and strength might baffle speed.    Another flash, another explosion, the hissing noise of rain. Lord  Milford moved aside, and jealous of the eye of another, read a letter  from Chifney, and in a few minutes afterwards offered to take the odds  against Pocket Hercules. Mr Latour walked to the window, surveyed the  heavens, sighed that there was not time to send his tiger from the door  to Epsom, and get information whether the storm had reached the Surrey  hills, for to-night's operations. It was too late. So he took a rusk and  a glass of lemonade, and retired to rest with a cool head and a cooler  heart.    The storm raged, the incessant flash played as it were round the  burnished cornice of the chamber, and threw a lurid hue on the scenes  of"]]]
