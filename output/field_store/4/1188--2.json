H. Patterson, D.S.O.          WITH A FOREWORD BY FREDERICK COURTENEY SELOUS      WITH ILLUSTRATIONS            PREFACE      It is with feelings of the greatest diffidence that I place the  following pages before the public; but those of my friends who happen  to have heard of my rather unique experiences in the wilds have so  often urged me to write an account of my adventures, that after much  hesitation I at last determined to do so.    I have no doubt that many of my readers, who have perhaps never been  very far away from civilisation, will be inclined to think that some of  the incidents are exaggerated. I can only assure them that I have toned  down the facts rather than otherwise, and have endeavoured to write a  perfectly plain and straightforward account of things as they actually  happened.    It must be remembered that at the time these events occurred, the  conditions prevailing in British East Africa were very different from  what they are to-day. The railway, which has modernised the aspect of  the place and brought civilisation in its train, was then only in  process of construction, and the country through which it was being  built was still in its primitive savage state, as indeed, away from the  railway, it still is.    If this simple account of two years' work and play in the wilds should  prove of any interest, or help even in a small way to call attention to  the beautiful and valuable country which we possess on the Equator, I  shall feel more than compensated for the trouble I have taken in  writing it.    I am much indebted to the Hon. Mrs. Cyril Ward, Sir Guilford  Molesworth, K.C.I.E., Mr. T.J. Spooner and Mr C. Rawson for their  kindness in allowing me to reproduce photographs taken by them. My  warmest thanks are also due to that veteran pioneer of Africa, Mr. F.C.  Selous, for giving my little book so kindly an introduction to the  public as is provided by the \"Foreword\" which he has been good enough  to write.    J.H.P. August, 1907.            FOREWORD      It was some seven or eight years ago that I first read, in the pages of  The Field newspaper, a brief account written by Col. J.H. Patterson,  then an engineer engaged on the construction of the Uganda Railway, of  the Tsavo man-eating lions.    My own long experience of African hunting told me at once that every  word in this thrilling narrative was absolutely true. Nay more: I knew  that the author had told his story in a most modest manner, laying but  little stress on the dangers he had run when sitting up at nights to  try and compass the death of the terrible man-eaters, especially on  that one occasion when whilst watching from a very light scaffolding,  supported only by four rickety poles, he was himself stalked by one of  the dread beasts. Fortunately he did not lose his nerve, and succeeded  in shooting the lion, just when it was on the point of springing upon  him. But had this lion approached him from behind, I think it would  probably have added Col. Patterson to its long list of victims, for in  my own experience I have known of three instances of men having been  pulled from trees or huts built on platforms at a greater height from  the ground than the crazy structure on which Col. Patterson was  watching on that night of terrors.    From the time of Herodotus until to-day, lion stories innumerable have  been told and written. I have put some on record myself. But no lion  story I have ever heard or read equals in its long-sustained and  dramatic interest the story of the Tsavo man-eaters as told by Col.  Patterson. A lion story is usually a tale of adventures, often very  terrible and pathetic, which occupied but a few hours of one night; but  the tale of the Tsavo man-eaters is an epic of terrible tragedies  spread out over several months, and only at last brought to an end by  the resource and determination of one man.    It was some years after I read the first account published of the Tsavo  man-eaters that I made the acquaintance of President Roosevelt. I told  him all I remembered about it, and he was so deeply interested in the  story--as he is in all true stories of the nature and characteristics  of wild animals--that he begged me to send him the short printed  account as published in The Field. This I did; and it was only in the  last letter I received from him that, referring to this story,  President Roosevelt wrote: \"I think that the incident of the Uganda  man-eating lions, described in those two articles you sent me, is the  most remarkable account of which we have any record. It is a great pity  that it should not be preserved in permanent form.\" Well, I am now glad  to think that it will be preserved in permanent form; and I venture to  assure Col. Patterson that President Roosevelt will be amongst the most  interested readers of his book.    It is probable that the chapters recounting the story of the Tsavo  man-eating lions will be found more absorbing than the other portions  of Col. Patterson's book; but I think that most of his readers will  agree with me that the whole volume is full of interest and  information. The account given by Col. Patterson of how he overcame all  the difficulties which confronted him in building a strong and  permanent railway bridge across the Tsavo river makes excellent  reading; whilst the courage he displayed in attacking, single-handed,  lions, rhinoceroses and other dangerous animals was surpassed by the  pluck, tact and determination he showed in quelling the formidable  mutiny which once broke out amongst his native Indian workers.    Finally, let me say that I have spent the best part of two nights  reading the proof-sheets of Col. Patterson's book, and I can assure him  that the time passed like magic. My interest was held from the first  page to the last, for I felt that every word I read was true.    F. C. SELOUS.    WORPLESDON, SURREY.      September 18, 1907.

The truth of the Greek proverb, that \"_a great book is a great evil_,\"  is no where more apparent than in the construction of works on  agricultural concerns. Those who have attended to the subject well  know, that the profitable management of live-stock is by far the most  difficult branch of farming, as it is here that improvement is  peculiarly tardy; and from this we might infer that authors would  endeavour so to arrange and simplify their treatises as to enable  every one to obtain the bearings of the study at the smallest possible  expense and trouble. Such, however, is not the case. Many would appear  to have done their best so to dilute and mystify the little which is  known about the matter, that it is nearly impossible for any one, not  gifted with more than ordinary power of application, to arrive at any  thing like just conclusions. To avoid this error has been my object in  the following pages. Such points only as are of real importance have  been noticed; every thing having been rejected which could not admit  of a practical application. For this reason, also, I have omitted all  allusion to foreign _varieties_ of the sheep, an account of which is,  in some similar works, made to occupy so large a space. The general  laws by which animal bodies are governed, and the changes to which  they are rendered liable by their subserviency to man, are here--and  for the first time as regards the sheep--gone into at considerable  length. Too little value is in general attached to such inquiries;  though, when endeavouring to improve a domesticated race, we must be  perfectly aware, that without this species of knowledge we are like a  ship at sea without the guiding aids of the rudder and the compass,  and liable to be carried in the right or in the wrong direction only  as chance directs.    In conclusion, I need make no apology for any defects that may appear  in this little work, having done my best to make it useful to the  farmer.    CASTLE STREET, DUMFRIES,    _July, 1838_.
