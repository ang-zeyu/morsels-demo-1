S. Herringbone_ of the Interstellar  Exploration, Examination (and Exploitation) Service was due to start her  return journey to Earth, one of her scouts disconcertingly reported the  discovery of intelligent life in the Virago System.    \"Thirteen planets,\" Captain Iversen snarled, wishing there were someone  on whom he could place the blame for this mischance, \"and we spend a  full year here exploring each one of them with all the resources of  Terrestrial science and technology, and what happens? On the nineteenth  moon of the eleventh planet, intelligent life is discovered. And who has  to discover it? Harkaway, of all people. I thought for sure all the  moons were cinders or I would never have sent him out to them just to  keep him from getting in my hair.\"    \"The boy's not a bad boy, sir,\" the first officer said. \"Just a thought  incompetent, that's all--which is to be expected if the Service will  choose its officers on the basis of written examinations. I'm glad to  see him make good.\"    Iversen would have been glad to see Harkaway make good, too, only such a  concept seemed utterly beyond the bounds of possibility. From the moment  the young man had first set foot on the _S. S. Herringbone_, he had  seemed unable to make anything but bad. Even in such a conglomeration of  fools under Captain Iverson, his idiocy was of outstanding quality.    The captain, however, had not been wholly beyond reproach in this  instance, as he himself knew. Pity he had made such an error about the  eleventh planet's moons. It was really such a small mistake. Moons one  to eighteen and twenty to forty-six still appeared to be cinders. It was  all too easy for the spectroscope to overlook Flimbot, the nineteenth.    But it would be Flimbot which had turned out to be a green and pleasant  planet, very similar to Earth. Or so Harkaway reported on the intercom.    \"And the other forty-five aren't really moons at all,\" he began.  \"They're--\"    \"You can tell me all that when we reach Flimbot,\" Iversen interrupted,  \"which should be in about six hours. Remember, that intercom uses a lot  of power and we're tight on fuel.\"    But it proved to be more than six _days_ later before the ship reached  Flimbot. This was owing to certain mechanical difficulties that arose  when the crew tried to lift the mother ship from the third planet, on  which it was based. For sentimental reasons, the IEE(E) always tried to  establish its prime base on the third planet of a system. Anyhow, when  the _Herringbone_ was on the point of takeoff, it was discovered that  the rock-eating species which was the only life on the third planet had  eaten all the projecting metal parts on the ship, including the  rocket-exhaust tubes, the airlock handles and the chromium trim.    \"I had been wondering what made the little fellows so sick,\" Smullyan,  the ship's doctor, said. \"They went wump, wump, wump all night long,  until my heart bled for them. Ah, everywhere it goes, humanity spreads  the fell seeds of death and destruction--\"    \"Are you a doctor or a veterinarian?\" Iversen demanded furiously. \"By  Betelgeuse, you act as if I'd crammed those blasted tubes down their  stinking little throats!\"    \"It was you who invaded their paradise with your ship. It was you--\"    \"Shut up!\" Iversen yelled. \"Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!\"    So Dr. Smullyan went off, like many a ship's physician before him, and  got good and drunk on the medical stores.           *       *       *       *       *    By the time they finally arrived on Flimbot, Harkaway had already gone  native. He appeared at the airlock wearing nothing but a brief, colorful  loincloth of alien fabric and a wreath of flowers in his hair. He was  fondling a large, woolly pink caterpillar.    [Illustration]    \"Where is your uniform, sir!\" Captain Iversen barked, aghast. If there  was one thing he was intolerant of in his command, it was sloppiness.    \"This is the undress uniform of the Royal Flimbotzi Navy, sir. I was  given the privilege of wearing one as a great _msu'gri_--honor--to our  race. If I were to return to my own uniform, it might set back  diplomatic relations between Flimbot and Earth as much as--\"    \"All right!\" the captain snapped. \"All right, all right, all right!\"    He didn't ask any questions about the Royal Flimbotzi Navy. He had  deduced its nature when, on nearing Flimbot, he had discovered that the  eleventh planet actually had only one moon. The other forty-five  celestial objects were spacecraft, quaint and primitive, it was true,  but spacecraft nonetheless. Probably it was their orbital formation that  had made him think they were moons. Oh, the crew must be in great  spirits; they did so enjoy having a good laugh at his expense!    He looked for something with which to reproach Harkaway, and his eye  lighted on the caterpillar. \"What's that thing you're carrying there?\"  he barked.    Raising itself on its tail, the caterpillar barked right back at him.    Captain Iversen paled. First he had overlooked the spacecraft, and now,  after thirty years of faithful service to the IEE(E) in the less  desirable sectors of space, he had committed the ultimate error in his  first contact with a new form of intelligent life!    \"Sorry, sir,\" he said, forgetting that the creature--whatever its mental  prowess--could hardly be expected to understand Terran yet. \"I am just a  simple spaceman and my ways are crude, but I mean no harm.\" He whirled  on Harkaway. \"I thought you said the natives were humanoid.\"    The young officer grinned. \"They are. This is just a greech. Cuddly  little fellow, isn't he?\" The greech licked Harkaway's face with a  tripartite blue tongue. \"The Flimbotzik are mad about pets. Great  animal-lovers. That's how I knew I could trust them right from the  start. Show me a life-form that loves animals, I always say, and--\"    \"I'm not interested in what you always say,\" Iversen interrupted,  knowing Harkaway's premise was fundamentally unsound, because he himself  was the kindliest of all men, and he hated animals. And, although he  didn't hate Harkaway, who was not an animal, save in the strictly  Darwinian sense, he could not repress unsportsmanlike feelings of  bitterness.    Why couldn't it have been one of the other officers who had discovered  the Flimbotzik? Why must it be Harkaway--the most inept of his scouts,  whose only talent seemed to be the egregious error, who always rushed  into a thing half-cocked, who mistook superficialities for profundities,  Harkaway, the blundering fool, the blithering idiot--who had stumbled  into this greatest discovery of Iversen's career? And, of course,  Harkaway's, too. Well, life was like that and always had been.    \"Have you tested those air and soil samples yet?\" Iversen snarled into  his communicator, for his spacesuit was beginning to itch again as the  gentle warmth of Flimbot activated certain small and opportunistic  life-forms which had emigrated from a previous system along with the  Terrans.    \"We're running them through as fast as we can, sir,\" said a harried  voice. \"We can offer you no more than our poor best.\"    \"But why bother with all that?\" Harkaway wanted to know. \"This planet is  absolutely safe for human life. I can guarantee it personally.\"    \"On what basis?\" Iversen asked.    \"Well, I've been here two weeks and I've survived, haven't I?\"    \"That,\" Iversen told him, \"does not prove that the planet can sustain  human life.\"    Harkaway laughed richly. \"Wonderful how you can still keep that  marvelous sense of humor, Skipper, after all the things that have been  going wrong on the voyage. Ah, here comes the _flim'tuu_--the welcoming  committee,\" he said quickly. \"They were a little shy before. Because of  the rockets, you know.\"    \"Don't their ships have any?\"    \"They don't seem to. They're really very primitive affairs, barely able  to go from planet to planet.\"    \"If they _go_,\" Iversen said, \"stands to reason _something_ must power  them.\"    \"I really don't know what it is,\" Harkaway retorted defensively. \"After  all, even though I've been busy as a beaver, three weeks would hardly  give me time to investigate every aspect of their culture.... Don't you  think the natives are remarkably humanoid?\" he changed the subject.    They were, indeed. Except for a somewhat greenish cast of countenance  and distinctly purple hair, as they approached, in their brief, gay  garments and flower garlands, the natives resembled nothing so much as a  group of idealized South Sea Islanders of the nineteenth century.    Gigantic butterflies whizzed about their heads. Countless small animals  frisked about their feet--more of the pink caterpillars; bright blue  creatures that were a winsome combination of monkey and koala; a kind of  large, merry-eyed snake that moved by holding its tail in its mouth and  rolling like a hoop. All had faces that reminded the captain of the work  of the celebrated twentieth-century artist W. Disney.    \"By Polaris,\" he cried in disgust, \"I might have known you'd find a  _cute_ planet!\"    \"Moon, actually,\" the first officer said, \"since it is in orbit around  Virago XI, rather than Virago itself.\"    \"Would you have _wanted_ them to be hostile?\" Harkaway asked peevishly.  \"Honestly, some people never seem to be satisfied.\"    From his proprietary airs, one would think Harkaway had created the  natives himself. \"At least, with hostile races, you know where you are,\"  Iversen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31671"],[0,"Plain Talks on Avoided Subjects (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This book was  produced from scanned images of public domain material  from the Google Print project.)

For many years I have wished that some able pen would place before the  community at large the knowledge contained in the following pages. Some  of this information has appeared from time to time in such books as  \"Graham's Lectures on Chastity,\" \"Todd's Students' Manual,\" and a few  popular works of a similar kind, which have been of immense service to  the human race in preserving chastity and in reclaiming the unchaste.  But all these are now inadequate to the growing demand for more light on  these vital topics. It has been too much the custom for everyone,  parents included, to shrink from instructing their own children, or  those entrusted to their care, on these points; consequently, many young  people _solely from their ignorance_ fall into the direst evils of a  sexual nature and are thereby much injured and sometimes wholly ruined  for life's important duties.    An experience of forty years in my professional career has afforded me  thousands of opportunities for sympathizing with young men, and young  women too, who had unconsciously sunk into these very evils merely for  want of an able writer to place this whole subject truthfully and  squarely before them, or for some wise friend to perform the same kind  office verbally. The perusal of a work by Wm. Acton, M. R. C. S., of  London, on \"The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs in  Childhood, Youth, Adult Age, and Advanced Life,\" has, by his purity of  sentiments, which have ever been identical with my own, both inspired  and emboldened me to write a work of similar import. But his is for the  profession while mine is for the profession and the laity, of both sexes  and of any age. May its perusal inspire the readers with a higher  appreciation of the matters herein treated, and with a greater effort to  reformatory measures everywhere. Whenever I advise the consulting of a  \"judicious\" (a term I use many times) physician, I mean one fully and  practically qualified, both by inherent qualities and education, for the  fullest confidence of his patients.    I am indebted to my son, Joseph C. Guernsey, M. D., for assistance in  editing and carrying this work through the press.                                   Henry N. Guernsey, M.

In the creation of the world and all that therein is, we should consider  it an axiom that \"Everything was created for use.\" All individual  substances, or beings, that come to our notice bear certain relations to  one another, have connection one with another, and are dependent upon  and useful to each other; and nothing could possibly exist or subsist  without this co-relation: connection with and use to each other. This is  a law which needs only a little reflection to be accepted as a truth in  every particular--in the greatest as well as in the least created form.  This is more plainly seen in the animal kingdom than in the mineral or  vegetable, because its members associate and finally become conjoined in  pairs. Man and woman, who represent the crown and glory of all created  beings, in whom are embodied all the lower orders, were and are still  created to associate in pairs--each created for the other, the one to  help the other; the two to love and to belong to one another. This  principle, fully carried out, justifies and shows the necessity for the  creation of man and woman precisely as they are, having bodies, parts  and passions, will and understanding. It is my intention in the  following pages to explain the relations existing between the sexes, for  the purpose of showing that the greatest happiness to the human race  will be found in living a life in full accord with these relations. In  order that the subject may be fully understood, let us examine the  physical development of man and woman in detail, particularizing the  different organs of the body as they appear in their order of formation,  from the very inmost or beginning, to the ultimate or end, in their  respective natures.    Ever since the primal creation of man and woman, the human race has been  perpetuated by a series of births. Children have been conceived in  harmony with the natural order of events, in such matters, and have been  born boys and girls. A boy is a boy to all intents and purposes from his  very conception, from the very earliest moment of his being; begotten by  his father he is a boy in embryo within the ovule of his mother. The  converse is true of the opposite sex. At this very early age of  reproduction the embryo has all the elements of the future man or  woman, mentally and physically, even before any form becomes apparent;  and so small is the human being at the earliest stage of its existence  that no material change is observable between the ovule that contains  the product of conception and a fully developed ovule unimpregnated.[A]      [A] For fuller particulars see Guernsey's Obstetrics, 3d edition,    pages 79-89, inclusive.    It is about twelve days after conception before the impregnated ovule,  which undergoes many changes during this time, makes its escape from the  ovary where it became impregnated and enters one of the Fallopian tubes,  thence gradually descending into the cavity of the womb. Here it begins  to mature and become fitted for its birth into the outer world. Soon now  the embryo (for such it is called at this early stage) begins to assume  form. The first indication of formation that it is possible to discover,  even by the help of the microscope, consists of an oblong figure, obtuse  at one extremity, swollen in the middle, blunt-pointed at the other  extremity. The rudimentary embryo is slightly curved forward, is of a  grayish white color, of a gelatinous consistence, from two to four lines  long and weighs one or two grains. A slight depression representing the  neck, enables us to distinguish the head; the body is marked by a  swollen centre, but there are as yet no traces of the extremities. So  much can be observed about the end of the third week after conception.    At about the _fifth week_ the embryo presents more distinctions. The  head is very large in proportion to the rest of the body, the eyes are  represented by two black spots, and the upper extremities by small  protuberances on the sides of the trunk. The embryo at this stage is  nearly two-thirds of an inch in length and weighs about fifteen grains.  The lower extremities now begin to appear in the shape of two minute  rounded tubercles. Till about this time a straight artery has been  observed to beat with the regularity of the pulse; but now it appears  doubled somewhat into the shape of an adult heart, although as yet it  has but one auricle and one ventricle. As time advances we find the  perfect heart with its two ventricles and two auricles, all developed  from the original straight artery. At this period the lungs appear to  exist in five or six different lobes and we can barely distinguish the  bronchial tubes; about the same time the ears and face are distinctly  outlined, and after awhile the nose is also faintly and imperfectly  perceived.    At about the _seventh week_ a little bony deposit is found in the lower "]]]
