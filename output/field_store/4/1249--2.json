There is a great difficulty in the way of a writer who attempts to  sketch a living Constitution--a Constitution that is in actual work and  power. The difficulty is that the object is in constant change. An  historical writer does not feel this difficulty: he deals only with the  past; he can say definitely, the Constitution worked in such and such a  manner in the year at which he begins, and in a manner in such and such  respects different in the year at which he ends; he begins with a  definite point of time and ends with one also. But a contemporary  writer who tries to paint what is before him is puzzled and a  perplexed: what he sees is changing daily. He must paint it as it stood  at some one time, or else he will be putting side by side in his  representations things which never were contemporaneous in reality. The  difficulty is the greater because a writer who deals with a living  Government naturally compares it with the most important other living  Governments, and these are changing too; what he illustrates are  altered in one way, and his sources of illustration are altered  probably in a different way. This difficulty has been constantly in my  way in preparing a second edition of this book. It describes the  English Constitution as it stood in the years 1865 and 1866. Roughly  speaking, it describes its working as it was in the time of Lord  Palmerston; and since that time there have been many changes, some of  spirit and some of detail. In so short a period there have rarely been  more changes. If I had given a sketch of the Palmerston time as a  sketch of the present time, it would have been in many points untrue;  and if I had tried to change the sketch of seven years since into a  sketch of the present time, I should probably have blurred the picture  and have given something equally unlike both.    The best plan in such a case is, I think, to keep the original sketch  in all essentials as it was at first written, and to describe shortly  such changes either in the Constitution itself, or in the Constitutions  compared with it, as seem material. There are in this book various  expressions which allude to persons who were living and to events which  were happening when it first appeared; and I have carefully preserved  these. They will serve to warn the reader what time he is reading  about, and to prevent his mistaking the date at which the likeness was  attempted to be taken. I proceed to speak of the changes which have  taken place either in the Constitution itself or in the competing  institutions which illustrate it.    It is too soon as yet to attempt to estimate the effect of the Reform  Act of 1867. The people enfranchised under it do not yet know their  own power; a single election, so far from teaching us how they will use  that power, has not been even enough to explain to them that they have  such power. The Reform Act of 1832 did not for many years disclose its  real consequences; a writer in 1836, whether he approved or disapproved  of them, whether he thought too little of or whether he exaggerated  them, would have been sure to be mistaken in them. A new Constitution  does not produce its full effect as long as all its subjects were  reared under an old Constitution, as long as its statesmen were trained  by that old Constitution. It is not really tested till it comes to be  worked by statesmen and among a people neither of whom are guided by a  different experience.    In one respect we are indeed particularly likely to be mistaken as to  the effect of the last Reform Bill. Undeniably there has lately been a  great change in our politics. It is commonly said that \"there is not a  brick of the Palmerston House standing\". The change since 1865 is a  change not in one point but in a thousand points; it is a change not of  particular details but of pervading spirit. We are now quarrelling as  to the minor details of an Education Act; in Lord Palmerston's time no  such Act could have passed. In Lord Palmerston's time Sir George Grey  said that the disestablishment of the Irish Church would be an \"act of  Revolution\"; it has now been disestablished by great majorities, with  Sir George Grey himself assenting. A new world has arisen which is not  as the old world; and we naturally ascribe the change to the Reform  Act. But this is a complete mistake. If there had been no Reform Act at  all there would, nevertheless, have been a great change in English  politics. There has been a change of the sort which, above all,  generates other changes--a change of generation. Generally one  generation in politics succeeds another almost silently; at every  moment men of all ages between thirty and seventy have considerable  influence; each year removes many old men, makes all others older,  brings in many new. The transition is so gradual that we hardly  perceive it. The board of directors of the political company has a few  slight changes every year, and therefore the shareholders are conscious  of no abrupt change. But sometimes there IS an abrupt change. It  occasionally happens that several ruling directors who are about the  same age live on for many years, manage the company all through those  years, and then go off the scene almost together. In that case the  affairs of the company are apt to alter much, for good or for evil;  sometimes it becomes more successful, sometimes it is ruined, but it  hardly ever stays as it was. Something like this happened before 1865.  All through the period between 1832 and 1865, the pre-'32 statesmen--if  I may so call them--Lord Derby, Lord Russell, Lord Palmerston, retained  great power. Lord Palmerston to the last retained great prohibitive  power. Though in some ways always young, he had not a particle of  sympathy with the younger generation; he brought forward no young men;  he obstructed all that young men wished. In consequence, at his death a  new generation all at once started into life; the pre-'32 all at once  died out. Most of the new politicians were men who might well have been  Lord Palmerston's grandchildren. He came into Parliament in 1806, they  entered it after 1856. Such an enormous change in the age of the  workers necessarily caused a great change in the kind of work attempted  and the way in which it was done. What we call the \"spirit\" of politics  is more surely changed by a change of generation in the men than by any  other change whatever. Even if there had been no Reform Act, this  single cause would have effected grave alterations.    The mere settlement of the Reform question made a great change too. If  it could have been settled by any other change, or even without any  change, the instant effect of the settlement would still have been  immense. New questions would have appeared at once. A political country  is like an American forest; you have only to cut down the old trees,  and immediately new trees come up to replace them; the seeds were  waiting in the ground, and they began to grow as soon as the withdrawal  of the old ones brought in light and air. These new questions of  themselves would have made a new atmosphere, new parties, new debates.    Of course I am not arguing that so important an innovation as the  Reform Act of 1867 will not have very great effects. It must, in all  likelihood, have many great ones. I am only saying that as yet we do  not know what those effects are; that the great evident change since  1865 is certainly not strictly due to it; probably is not even in a  principal measure due to it; that we have still to conjecture what it  will cause and what it will not cause.    The principal question arises most naturally from a main doctrine of  these essays. I have said that Cabinet government is possible in  England because England was a deferential country. I meant that the  nominal constituency was not the real constituency; that the mass of  the \"ten-pound\" house-holders did not really form their own opinions,  and did not exact of their representatives an obedience to those  opinions; that they were in fact guided in their judgment by the better  educated classes; that they preferred representatives from those  classes, and gave those representatives much licence. If a hundred  small shopkeepers had by miracle been added to any of the '32  Parliaments, they would have felt outcasts there. Nothing could be more  unlike those Parliaments than the average mass of the constituency from  which they were chosen.    I do not of course mean that the ten-pound householders were great  admirers of intellect or good judges of refinement. We all know that,  for the most part, they were not so at all; very few Englishmen are.  They were not influenced by ideas, but by facts; not by things  impalpable, but by things palpable. Not to put too fine a point upon  it, they were influenced by rank and wealth. No doubt the better sort  of them believed that those who were superior to them in these  indisputable respects were superior also in the more intangible  qualities of sense and knowledge. But the mass of the old electors did  not analyse very much: they liked to have one of their \"betters\" to  represent them; if he was rich they respected him much; and if he was a  lord, they liked him the better. The issue put before these electors  was, Which of two rich people will you choose? And each of those rich  people was put forward by great parties whose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#1)"],[1,"AN ESSAY ON THE MEANING OF THE COMIC      BY HENRI BERGSON      MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE PROFESSOR AT THE COLLEGE DE FRANCE            AUTHORISED TRANSLATION    BY CLOUDESLEY BRERETON L. ES L. (PARIS), M.A. (CANTAB) AND FRED  ROTHWELL B.A. (LONDON)          TRANSLATORS' PREFACE      This work, by Professor Bergson, has been revised in detail by the  author himself, and the present translation is the only authorised one.  For this ungrudging labour of revision, for the thoroughness with which  it has been carried out, and for personal sympathy in many a difficulty  of word and phrase, we desire to offer our grateful acknowledgment to  Professor Bergson. It may be pointed out that the essay on Laughter  originally appeared in a series of three articles in one of the leading  magazines in France, the Revue de Paris. This will account for the  relatively simple form of the work and the comparative absence of  technical terms. It will also explain why the author has confined  himself to exposing and illustrating his novel theory of the comic  without entering into a detailed discussion of other explanations  already in the field. He none the less indicates, when discussing  sundry examples, why the principal theories, to which they have given  rise, appear to him inadequate. To quote only a few, one may mention  those based on contrast, exaggeration, and degradation.    The book has been highly successful in France, where it is in its  seventh edition. It has been translated into Russian, Polish, and  Swedish. German and Hungarian translations are under preparation. Its  success is due partly to the novelty of the explanation offered of the  comic, and partly also to the fact that the author incidentally  discusses questions of still greater interest and importance. Thus, one  of the best known and most frequently quoted passages of the book is  that portion of the last chapter in which the author outlines a general  theory of art.    C. B. F. R.            CONTENTS      CHAPTER I    THE COMIC IN GENERAL--THE COMIC ELEMENT IN FORMS AND  MOVEMENTS--EXPANSIVE FORCE OF THE COMIC      CHAPTER II    THE COMIC ELEMENT IN SITUATIONS AND THE COMIC ELEMENT IN WORDS      CHAPTER III    THE COMIC IN CHARACTER          CHAPTER I    THE COMIC IN GENERAL--THE COMIC ELEMENT IN FORMS AND  MOVEMENTS--EXPANSIVE FORCE OF THE COMIC.      What does laughter mean? What is the basal element in the laughable?  What common ground can we find between the grimace of a merry-andrew, a  play upon words, an equivocal situation in a burlesque and a scene of  high comedy? What method of distillation will yield us invariably the  same essence from which so many different products borrow either their  obtrusive odour or their delicate perfume? The greatest of thinkers,  from Aristotle downwards, have tackled this little problem, which has a  knack of baffling every effort, of slipping away and escaping only to  bob up again, a pert challenge flung at philosophic speculation. Our  excuse for attacking the problem in our turn must lie in the fact that  we shall not aim at imprisoning the comic spirit within a definition.  We regard it, above all, as a living thing. However trivial it may be,  we shall treat it with the respect due to life. We shall confine  ourselves to watching it grow and expand. Passing by imperceptible  gradations from one form to another, it will be seen to achieve the  strangest metamorphoses. We shall disdain nothing we have seen. Maybe  we may gain from this prolonged contact, for the matter of that,  something more flexible than an abstract definition,--a practical,  intimate acquaintance, such as springs from a long companionship. And  maybe we may also find that, unintentionally, we have made an  acquaintance that is useful. For the comic spirit has a logic of its  own, even in its wildest eccentricities. It has a method in its  madness. It dreams, I admit, but it conjures up, in its dreams, visions  that are at once accepted and understood by the whole of a social  group. Can it then fail to throw light for us on the way that human  imagination works, and more particularly social, collective, and  popular imagination? Begotten of real life and akin to art, should it  not also have something of its own to tell us about art and life?    At the outset we shall put forward three observations which we look  upon as fundamental. They have less bearing on the actually comic than  on the field within which it must be sought.      I    The first point to which attention should be called is that the comic  does not exist outside the pale of what is strictly HUMAN. A landscape  may be beautiful, charming and sublime, or insignificant and ugly; it  will never be laughable. You may laugh at an animal, but only because  you have detected in it some human attitude or expression. You may  laugh at a hat, but what you are making fun of, in this case, is not  the piece of felt or straw, but the shape that men have given it,--the  human caprice whose mould it has assumed. It is strange that so  important a fact, and such a simple one too, has not attracted to a  greater degree the attention of philosophers. Several have defined man  as \"an animal which laughs.\" They might equally well have defined him  as an animal which is laughed at; for if any other animal, or some  lifeless object, produces the same effect, it is always because of some  resemblance to man, of the stamp he gives it or the use he puts it to.    Here I would point out, as a symptom equally worthy of notice, the  ABSENCE OF FEELING which usually accompanies laughter. It seems as  though the comic could not produce its disturbing effect unless it  fell, so to say, on the surface of a soul that is thoroughly calm and  unruffled. Indifference is its natural environment, for laughter has no  greater foe than emotion. I do not mean that we could not laugh at a  person who inspires us with pity, for instance, or even with affection,  but in such a case we must, for the moment, put our affection out of  court and impose silence upon our pity. In a society composed of pure  intelligences there would probably be no more tears, though perhaps  there would still be laughter; whereas highly emotional souls, in tune  and unison with life, in whom every event would be sentimentally  prolonged and re-echoed, would neither know nor understand laughter.  Try, for a moment, to become interested in everything that is being  said and done; act, in imagination, with those who act, and feel with  those who feel; in a word, give your sympathy its widest expansion: as  though at the touch of a fairy wand you will see the flimsiest of  objects assume importance, and a gloomy hue spread over everything. Now  step aside, look upon life as a disinterested spectator: many a drama  will turn into a comedy. It is enough for us to stop our ears to the  sound of music, in a room where dancing is going on, for the dancers at  once to appear ridiculous. How many human actions would stand a similar  test? Should we not see many of them suddenly pass from grave to gay,  on isolating them from the accompanying music of sentiment? To produce  the whole of its effect, then, the comic demands something like a  momentary anesthesia of the heart. Its appeal is to intelligence, pure  and simple.    This intelligence, however, must always remain in touch with other  intelligences. And here is the third fact to which attention should be  drawn. You would hardly appreciate the comic if you felt yourself  isolated from others. Laughter appears to stand in need of an echo,  Listen to it carefully: it is not an articulate, clear, well-defined  sound; it is something which would fain be prolonged by reverberating  from one to another, something beginning with a crash, to continue in  successive rumblings, like thunder in a mountain. Still, this  reverberation cannot go on for ever. It can travel within as wide a  circle as you please: the circle remains, none the less, a closed one.  Our laughter is always the laughter of a group. It may, perchance, have  happened to you, when seated in a railway carriage or at table d'hote,  to hear travellers relating to one another stories which must have been  comic to them, for they laughed heartily. Had you been one of their  company, you would have laughed like them; but, as you were not, you  had no desire whatever to do so. A man who was once asked why he did  not weep at a sermon, when everybody else was shedding tears, replied:  \"I don't belong to the parish!\" What that man thought of tears would be  still more true of laughter. However spontaneous it seems, laughter  always implies a kind of secret freemasonry, or even complicity, with  other laughers, real or imaginary. How often has it been said that the  fuller the theatre, the more uncontrolled the laughter of the audience!  On the other hand, how often has the remark been made that many comic  effects are incapable of translation from one language to another,  because they refer to the customs and ideas of a particular social  group! It is through not understanding the importance of this double  fact that the comic has been looked upon as a mere curiosity in which  the mind finds amusement, and laughter itself as a strange, isolated  phenomenon, without any bearing on the rest of human activity. Hence  those definitions which tend to make the comic into an abstract  relation between ideas: \"an intellectual contrast,\" \"a palpable  absurdity,\" etc.,--definitions which, even were they really suitable to  every form of the comic, would not in the least explain why the comic  makes us laugh. How, indeed, should it come about that this particular  logical relation, as soon as it is perceived, contracts, expands and  shakes our limbs, whilst all other relations leave the body unaffected?  It is not from this point of view that we shall approach the problem.  To understand laughter, we must put it back into its natural "]]]
