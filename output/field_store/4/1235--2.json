DEDICATION      AUSTRALIA--ONE AND UNITED. AS AN AUSTRALIAN I DEDICATE THIS VOLUME TO  THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA WITH ONE ABIDING HOPE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF  ALL THE: GREAT NATURAL FOOD INDUSTRIES OF OUR COUNTRY.          PREFACE.      Although this work fully deals with all the many matters connected with  the art of living in Australia, its principal object is the attempt to  bring about some improvement in the extraordinary food-habits at  present in vogue. For years past the fact that our people live in  direct opposition to their semi-tropical environment has been  constantly before me. As it will be found in the opening portion of the  chapter on School Cookery, the consumption of butcher's meat and of tea  is enormously in excess of any common sense requirements, and is  paralleled nowhere else in the world. On the other hand, there has been  no real attempt to develop our deep-sea fisheries; market gardening is  deplorably neglected, only a few of the more ordinary varieties being  cultivated; salads, which are easily within the daily reach of every  home, are conspicuous by their absence; and Australian wine, which  should be the national beverage of every-day life, is at table--almost  a curiosity.    Nearly three years have been occupied in the preparation of this  volume, as several of the subjects it treats of have hitherto remained  practically unexplored. This statement is not intended to excuse  any shortcomings, but simply to explain the impediments which had to be  overcome. There has been some little difficulty, therefore, in  obtaining information in many instances. At the same time, it must be  cheerfully recorded that assistance was freely forthcoming on the part  of those from whom it was sought. Quite a number have been interviewed  on the topics with which they were familiar; and on several occasions  this has necessitated journeys out of Sydney on the writer's part. With  the object of making inquiries into the fish supply of Melbourne, also,  a special visit was paid to that city. And further, in order to gain an  insight into vineyard work and cellar management, an instructive time  was passed at Dr. T. Fiaschi's magnificent Tizzana vineyard on the  Hawkesbury River.    It may seem to savour somewhat of boldness, yet I hazard the opinion  that the real development of Australia will never actually begin till  this wilful violation of her people's food-life ceases. For let us  suppose that the semi-tropical character of our Australian life was  duly appreciated by one and all. If such were the case--and I would it  were so--there would be a wonderful change from the present state of  affairs. But as it is, the manners and customs of the Australians are a  perpetual challenge to the range of temperature in which they live.  Indeed, the form of food they indulge in proves incontestably  that they have never yet realized their semi-tropical environment. With  a proper recognition of existing climatic surroundings there would be  an overwhelming demand for more fish food; for something better than  the present Liliputian supply; and for the creation of extensive deep-sea  fisheries. Fish in Australia is nothing more than a high-priced  luxury, although projects for the development of the deep-sea fisheries  have been repeatedly suggested. Somehow or other we never get beyond  this stage, and as a consequence the yield from our fisheries is simply  pitiable. A widespread use of fish and an adequate fish supply would  give employment to hundreds and to thousands. As I have pointed out in  the chapter relating to this subject, the want of enterprise shown in  starting our deep-sea fisheries is an inexplicable anomaly. If the  Australian people had sprung from an inland race, this would not,  perhaps, have been so difficult to understand. But coming, as we do,  from a stock the most maritime the world has ever seen, such a defect  is not to our credit as inheritors of the old traditions.    Nor can it be pretended that market gardening has ever been taken up  seriously, if we apply the statement to Australia as a whole. It is  true that Sydney and Melbourne, and possibly Adelaide and Brisbane,  have made an attempt in this direction. But even with this  admission there is not much reason for congratulation from an olitory  point of view. Few--only very few--of the more commonly known  varieties are grown. For if the potato and the cabbage were taken away,  Australia would be almost bereft of vegetables. There are, however,  many others, which are delicious and wholesome, which are easily grown,  and which would make a pleasing addition to the present monotonously  restricted choice. And there is something even more than all this. It  is, that market gardening is a healthy and profitable calling; that it  settles the people on the land; and that it creates a class of small  landed proprietors--the very bone and sinew of any population.    In the chapter relating to Australian Food Habits it will be found that  many of these desirable vegetables are enumerated. Their good qualities  are highly appreciated on the Continent and elsewhere, and there is no  earthly reason why they should not be grown here. The history of the  introduction of the tomato into Australia is instructive in this  connection. For years and years it struggled desperately, but  unsuccessfully, for a place, and the attempt to bring it into use was  on the point of being abandoned in consequence. But at last its  undeniable merits were acknowledged, and to-day it is in universal  request. Now, it is perfectly safe to assume that the same recognition  would be awarded to many other vegetables vegetables at present  practically unknown in Australia. For instance, sweet corn--which,  however, must not be confused with Indian corn--is of exquisite  flavour, almost melting in the mouth, while it possesses also eminently  nourishing properties. It is a great favourite with Americans, and  hundreds of acres are required annually for the New York markets alone.    But if there is one desirable form of food which we should expect to  find in daily use by the whole Community, it is surely the salad. More  than this, it deserves to meet with favour as a national dish. It takes  pre-eminent rank in Southern Europe, and is certainly entitled to  occupy a similar high position in the Australian food list.  Unfortunately there is just the same story to tell, and the strange  neglect of salads can only be expressed by the term incomprehensible.  It is a waste-saving dish; it is wholesome, in that it is purifying to  the blood; it is full of infinite variety; and its low price brings it  within easy every-day reach even of the humblest dwelling. But, as  things are, even the salad plants themselves are represented by a  meagre list, and are confined to only few varieties. And as far as  salad herbs are concerned, they are literally unknown.    Now, although I am strongly of opinion that a more widespread use of  fish, vegetables, and salads in Australia would be attended by the  happiest results (both by benefiting the national health and by  developing Australia's food-industries), yet it must not be understood  that I countenance vegetarianism. So far from being a vegetarian, I am  one of those who firmly believe in the advantages derived from a mixed  diet. But my assertion is that we in Australia habitually consume an  injurious amount of meat to the exclusion of far more needed  nourishment. The golden rule as far as the Australian dietary is  concerned is a minimum of meat, and a relatively maximum amount of the  other classes of food. The influence which food exercises upon health  is a matter of far-reaching importance, in that it affects the daily  life of the whole population. Amongst others, the following medical  writers--Sir James Risdon Bennett, Dr. J. Milner Fothergill, Dr. T.  King Chambers, and Dr. J.H. Bennett--have in the past contributed much  to this subject. In the present day, Sir Henry Thompson, Sir William  Roberts, Dr. T. Lauder Brunton, Dr. F.W. Pavy, Dr. Burney Yeo, and many  more have given their advocacy to the same purpose. It is urged by all  these authorities that there is a needless consumption of animal food  even in the old country, and they all agree that an exaggerated value  is attached to butcher's meat on the part of the public. If  representative medical opinion thus protests against the use of an  unnecessary amount of animal diet in the climatic conditions obtaining  in the United Kingdom, how much more would the misuse of the  same food in a semi-tropical climate like Australia be disapproved of!  Indeed, I am perfectly certain, that were those who have given  attention to food and dietetics in possession of the facts, they would  unhesitatingly condemn the grotesque inversion of food-habits at  present in vogue throughout Australia. There is one very important  matter which unquestionably requires to have special attention drawn to  it. I refer to the customary Australian mid-day meal. Strange to say,  all through the hot season, as well as the rest of the year, this  consists in most cases of a heavy repast always comprising meat. Why,  even in the cooler months, a ponderous meal of this kind is not  required! My own views are that meat in the middle of the day is quite  unnecessary, and, indeed, during the hot months actually prejudicial.  Most people in Australia, after a fair trial, will find that a lunch of  some warm soup, with a course perhaps of some fish, and vegetables, or  salad, or whatever it may be to follow, will not only be ample, but  will give them a sensation of buoyancy in the afternoon they never  before experienced.

TALMAGE,    IN THE OFFICE OF THE LIBRARIAN OF    CONGRESS, AT WASHINGTON.      COPYRIGHT 1913    BY JOSEPH F. SMITH    TRUSTEE-IN-TRUST FOR THE CHURCH OF    JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.          PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.      The lectures herewith presented have been prepared in accordance with  the request and appointment of the First Presidency of the Church. The  greater number of the addresses were delivered before the Theology  Class of the Church University; and, after the close of the class  sessions, the lectures were continued before other Church  organizations engaged in the study of theology. To meet the desire  expressed by the Church authorities,--that the lectures be published  for use in the various educational institutions of the Church,--the  matter has been revised, and is now presented in this form.    In anticipation of probable question or criticism regarding the  disparity of length of the several lectures, it may be stated that  each of the addresses occupied two or more class sessions, and that  the present arrangement of the matter in separate lectures is rather  one of compilation than of original presentation.    The author's thanks are due and are heartily rendered to the members  of the committee appointed by the First Presidency, whose painstaking  and efficient examination of the manuscript prior to the delivery of  the lectures, has inspired some approach to confidence in the  prospective value of the book among members of the Church. The  committee here referred to consisted of Elders Francis M. Lyman,  Abraham H. Cannon, and Anthon H. Lund, of the Quorum of the Twelve  Apostles; Elder George Reynolds, one of the Presidents of the  Presiding Quorum of Seventy; Elder John Nicholson, and Dr. Karl G.  Maeser.    The lectures are now published by the Church, and with them goes the  hope of the author that they may prove of some service to the many  students of the scriptures among our people, and to other earnest  inquirers into the doctrines and practices of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints.
