Among the many outdoor occupations, trapping the furbearing animals  is perhaps the most pleasant and in many instances is also very  profitable.    Although trapping was one of the earliest industries of this country,  the occupation has not passed away, along with the vanishing  wilderness, for there is more trapping done today than at any time  during the past. Scattered all over North America, in both the  thickly settled portions and the more remote districts are thousands  of trappers who are each season deriving both pleasure and profit  from this unique calling.    Trapping in itself is an art. Many of the wild creatures are  exceedingly wary and the trapper must match his reason against the  instinct, the natural wariness and the acquired knowledge of the  animals. This wariness alone has saved some species of animals from  extinction, and although man is superior to all brute life, such  intelligent animals as the fox and the wolf frequently prove a match  for the most expert of trappers.    In order to be successful, one must know the wild animals as a mother  knows her child. He must also know and use the most practical methods  of trapping, and it is my object to give in this work, the most  successful trapping methods known.    These modes of trapping the furbearing animals have for the most part  been learned from actual experience in various parts of the country,  but I also give the methods of other successful trappers, knowing  them to be as good as my own. I am personally acquainted with some of  the most expert trappers in North America and have also followed the  Indians over their trap lines and in this way have learned many  things which to the white man are not generally known.    E. KREPS.        SCIENCE OF TRAPPING.        CHAPTER I.    THE TRAPPER'S ART.    During past ages many of the wild creatures of the forest and stream  were hunted and captured in various ways by the inhabitants of the  wilderness,--the flesh of these animals being the principal food of  many tribes of savages and the skins being used for clothing; but it  was only after furs became a staple article of wearing apparel among  civilized nations and the traders had learned of the profits to be  made in the fur trade that wholesale and systematic trapping began.  For many years after the commencement of the fur trade in this  country, the occupation of trapping was monopolized by the native  inhabitants, but later some of the bolder of the white race pushed  into the wilderness and learned the trapper's art.    To-day there are thousands of trappers scattered over the United  States, Canada, Alaska and Mexico and the catching of wild animals  for profit is no longer considered to be an occupation fitting only  for the savage, for there is scarcely a farmer, ranchman or other  person whose calling brings him close to nature who is not more or  less interested in the fur-bearing animals. Wild animals are not all  hunted for the sake of their furs. There are some such as the wolf,  coyote, mountain lion and wild-cat which have become positive  nuisances because of their destruction of stock and for such the  government and in many cases the stockmen pay a bounty. The capture  of wolves and coyotes especially has become a profitable business.    As to the profits to be derived from this occupation, there are  professional trappers in the North, South and West whose catches  amount to from five hundred to two thousand dollars or more each  season, but the number who do as well as that is comparatively small.  By far the greater number of trappers are those who follow other  occupations and devote only their spare time to the capture of wild  animals and they are for the most part farmers and country boys who  in this way add considerable to their yearly income.    It is not at all necessary to go into the wilds in order to do  successful trapping, and almost any farming section will be found to  be a paying trapping ground. Indeed, the country man or boy will in  most cases do far better in his own home district than he would by  going into some place with which he is not familiar even though the  fur-bearing animals be more plentiful there than at home. In his own  territory he will learn the haunts of each kind of fur-bearing  animal, its route of travel, the dens, etc., and this knowledge will  be of great value when the actual trapping commences.    Of course all of the various species of animals will not be found in  any one section but where one is missing there will be some other  found in fair numbers. Muskrats are most numerous as a rule in the  settled parts of the country and wherever the muskrat is found there  the mink is also. Skunks are found almost everywhere and the ease  with which they may be captured makes the trapping of them a  lucrative business. Foxes are found in most of the hilly sections and  while they are not so easily captured, one can make a success of it  if he gives the matter careful study and uses sufficient care in  setting and attending the traps. In many parts of the South the  raccoon is found in abundance as is also the opossum and the otter,  the wild cat and other animals are found more sparingly in many parts  of the country.    The trapper no matter where he is located is certain to meet with  many hardships but it is a pleasant calling for all of that and there  is a certain amount of pleasure in even the roughest experiences.  Once one has followed trapping for a few seasons it is almost  impossible to give up the wild, free life. The study of the habits of  the wild creatures which is necessary if one wishes to become a  successful trapper brings one into close touch with nature and the  work is extremely fascinating.    In the early days before the steel trap came into general use, the  deadfall and the snare were used almost exclusively for the capture  of the fur-bearers, but at present when steel traps have reached a  high state of perfection, are sold at prices which place them within  the reach of all, they are preferred by most trappers and many of the  most expert have discarded the wooden traps entirely. However, both  the deadfall and the snare are good traps for certain animals and it  is well to know how to make and use them for one may sometimes see a  good place in which to place a trap but may not have a steel trap  along. In such cases the knowledge of how to construct a practical  deadfall will be of value. It is true that many of the fur-bearing  animals are too cunning to be captured by such a contrivance but some  of the most wary fall easy victims to the snare. Some of the most  expert fox trappers use the snare in preference to the steel trap but  the number is comparatively small.    Many styles of traps have been invented and some of the most  promising styles were placed on the market but it is doubtful if any  trap will ever be designed which will equal in popularity and general  usefulness the old time jaw trap, commonly known as the \"steel trap\".  These traps have been improved in many ways until at present they are  almost perfect and are made in sizes and styles to meet all  requirements and all conditions of trapping.    The jaw traps possess decided advantages over all other styles of  steel or wooden traps. They are light and compact and may be moved  from place to place without inconvenience to the trapper, will  capture the most wary animals as well as the most stupid and will  work perfectly under all conditions whether set in the water or on  dry land, on the snow or on a log or stump or the side of a tree.  They may be used with or without bait and if the proper size of trap  is used and it is set in the right way it will capture almost any  animal that comes that way. What other style of trap possesses all of  these advantages?    As most of those who have never done any trapping know practically  nothing regarding the use of traps I will outline briefly the methods  usually employed for the capture of fur-bearing animals before  proceeding farther.    Most of the animals which are caught in traps are decoyed by means of  a bait,--something in the line of food which appeals to its  appetite,--s"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#1)"],[1,"AND LEGENDS OF THE SIOUX    By Mrs. Marie L.

My maternal grandfather, Captain Duncan  Graham, a Scotchman by birth, who had seen service in the British Army,  was one of a party of Scotch Highlanders who in 1811 arrived in the  British Northwest by way of York Factory, Hudson Bay, to found what was  known as the Selkirk Colony, near Lake Winnipeg, now within the  province of Manitoba, Canada. Soon after his arrival at Lake Winnipeg he  proceeded up the Red River of the North and the western fork thereof  to its source, and thence down the Minnesota River to Mendota, the  confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, where he located. My  grandmother, Ha-za-ho-ta-win, was a full-blood of the Medawakanton Band  of the Sioux Tribe of Indians. My father, Joseph Buisson, born near  Montreal, Canada, was connected with the American Fur Company, with  headquarters at Mendota, Minnesota, which point was for many years the  chief distributing depot of the American Fur Company, from which the  Indian trade conducted by that company on the upper Mississippi was  directed.    I was born December 8, 1842, at Wabasha, Minnesota, then Indian country,  and resided thereat until fourteen years of age, when I was sent to  school at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.    I was married to Major James McLaughlin at Mendota, Minnesota,  January 28, 1864, and resided in Minnesota until July 1, 1871, when I  accompanied my husband to Devils Lake Agency, North Dakota, then Dakota  Territory, where I remained ten years in most friendly relations with  the Indians of that agency. My husband was Indian agent at Devils Lake  Agency, and in 1881 was transferred to Standing Rock, on the Missouri  River, then a very important agency, to take charge of the Sioux who  had then but recently surrendered to the military authorities, and been  brought by steamboat from various points on the upper Missouri, to be  permanently located on the Standing Rock reservation.    Having been born and reared in an Indian community, I at an early age  acquired a thorough knowledge of the Sioux language, and having lived on  Indian reservations for the past forty years in a position which brought  me very near to the Indians, whose confidence I possessed, I have,  therefore, had exceptional opportunities of learning the legends and  folk-lore of the Sioux.    The stories contained in this little volume were told me by the older  men and women of the Sioux, of which I made careful notes as related,  knowing that, if not recorded, these fairy tales would be lost to  posterity by the passing of the primitive Indian.    The notes of a song or a strain of music coming to us through the night  not only give us pleasure by the melody they bring, but also give us  knowledge of the character of the singer or of the instrument from which  they proceed. There is something in the music which unerringly tells us  of its source. I believe musicians call it the \"timbre\" of the sound. It  is independent of, and different from, both pitch and rhythm; it is the  texture of the music itself.    The \"timbre\" of a people's stories tells of the qualities of that  people's heart. It is the texture of the thought, independent of its  form or fashioning, which tells the quality of the mind from which it  springs.    In the \"timbre\" of these stories of the Sioux, told in the lodges and  at the camp fires of the past, and by the firesides of the Dakotas of  today, we recognize the very texture of the thought of a simple, grave,  and sincere people, living in intimate contact and friendship with the  big out-of-doors that we call Nature; a race not yet understanding all  things, not proud and boastful, but honest and childlike and fair; a  simple, sincere, and gravely thoughtful people, willing to believe that  there may be in even the everyday things of life something not yet fully  understood; a race that can, without any loss of native dignity, gravely  consider the simplest things, seeking to fathom their meaning and to  learn their lesson--equally without vain-glorious boasting and trifling  cynicism; an earnest, thoughtful, dignified, but simple and primitive  people.    To the children of any race these stories can not fail to give pleasure  by their vivid imaging of the simple things and creatures of the great  out-of-doors and the epics of their doings. They will also give an  intimate insight into the mentality of an interesting race at a most  interesting stage of development, which is now fast receding into the  mists of the past.      MARIE L. McLAUGHLIN (Mrs. James McLaughlin).    McLaughlin, S. D., May 1, 1913.          THE FORGOTTEN EAR OF CORN    An Arikara woman was once gathering corn from the field to store away  for winter use. She passed from stalk to stalk, tearing off the ears and  dropping them into her folded robe. When all was gathered she started to  go, when she heard a faint voice, like a child's, weeping and calling:    \"Oh, do not leave me! Do not go away without me.\"    The woman was astonished. \"What child can that be?\" she asked herself.  \"What babe can be lost in the cornfield?\"    She set down her robe in which she had tied up her corn, and went back  to search; but she found nothing.    As she started away she heard the voice again:    \"Oh, do not leave me. Do not go away without me.\"    She searched for a long time. At last in one corner of the field, hidden  under the leaves of the stalks, she found one little ear of corn. This  it was that had been crying, and this is why all Indian women have since  garnered their corn crop very carefully, so that the succulent food  product should not even to the last small nubbin be neglected or wasted,  and thus displease the Great Mystery.            THE LITTLE MICE    Once upon a time a prairie mouse busied herself all fall storing away a  cache of beans. Every morning she was out early with her empty cast-off  snake skin, which she filled with ground beans and dragged home with her  teeth.    The little mouse had a cousin who was fond of dancing and talk, but who  did not like to work. She was not careful to get her cache of beans and  the season was already well gone before she thought to bestir herself.  When she came to realize her need, she found she had no packing bag. So  she went to her hardworking cousin and said:    \"Cousin, I have no beans stored for winter and the season is nearly  gone. But I have no snake skin to gather the beans in. Will you lend me  one?\"    \"But why have you no packing bag? Where were you in the moon when the  snakes cast off their skins?\"    \"I was here.\"    \"What were you doing?\"    \"I was busy talking and dancing.\"    \"And now you are punished,\" said the other. \"It is always so with lazy,  careless people. But I will let you have the snake skin. And now go, and  by hard work and industry, try to recover your wasted time.\"              THE PET RABBIT    A little girl owned a pet rabbit which she loved dearly. She carried it  on her back like a babe, made for it a little pair of moccasins, and at  night shared with it her own robe.    Now the little girl had a cousin who loved her very dearly and wished to  do her honor; so her cousin said to herself:    \"I love my little cousin well and will ask her to let me carry her pet  rabbit around;\" (for thus do Indian women when they wish to honor a  friend; they ask permission to carry about the friend's babe).    She then went to the little girl and said:    \"Cousin, let me carry your pet rabbit about on my back. Thus shall I  show you how I love you.\"    Her mother, too, said to her: \"Oh no, do not let our little grandchild  go away from our tepee.\"    But the cousin answered: \"Oh, do let me carry it. I do so want to show  my cousin honor.\" At last they let her go away with the pet rabbit on  her back.    When the little girl's cousin came home to her tepee, some rough boys  who were playing about began to make sport of her. To tease the little  girl they threw stones and sticks at the pet rabbit. At last a stick  struck the little rabbit upon the head and killed it.    When her pet was brought home dead, the little rabbit's adopted mother  wept"]]]
