The individual operations of glass-blowing are much less difficult than  is usually supposed, and considerable success in the performance of most  of them may be attained by any one who is endowed with average powers of  manipulation and who is moderately persistent. Constructing finished  apparatus is often more difficult, as it may involve the performance of  several operations under disadvantageous conditions, and may demand a  little ingenuity on the part of the operator. But I think the  suggestions in Chapter IV. will make this comparatively easy also to  those who have mastered the operations described in Chapter III.    The working of vitreous silica, though more tedious and expensive than  glass-blowing, is not really more difficult, and as it seems certain  that this new material will soon play a useful part in chemical and  physical research, I believe the addition now made to the earlier book  will add considerably to its value.    As glass is much less expensive to work with than silica, the beginner  will find it best to spend a few days working with the common gas  blow-pipe and glass before he attempts to manipulate the new and more  refractory material. Therefore, in writing the new chapter, I have  assumed that the reader is already more or less familiar with the rest  of the book, and have given only such instructions and advice as will be  required by one who is already able to carry out simple work at the  blow-pipe.

I shall not give any particular  account of the manufacture of such apparatus as thermometers, taps,  etc., because, being in large demand, they can be bought so cheaply that  time is not profitably spent in making them. But it will be found that  what is included will enable any one, who will devote sufficient time to  acquiring the necessary manipulative dexterity, to prepare such  apparatus as test-tubes, distillation flasks, apparatus for washing  gases, ozone generating tubes, etc., when they are required, as they  often are, without delay or for special purposes. The amateur probably  will not succeed in turning out apparatus so finished in appearance as  that of the professional glass-blower until after long practice, but  after a little daily practice for the space of a few weeks, any one who  is fairly skilful in ordinary manipulation, and who perseveres in the  face of failure at first, will find himself able to make almost all the  apparatus he needs for lecture or other experiments, with a considerable  saving in laboratory expenses, and, which very often is more important,  without the delay that occurs when one depends upon the professional  glass-worker. In the case of those who, like myself, work in the  provinces, this latter advantage is a very weighty one.    After the description of the instruments used in glass-blowing, which  immediately follows, the following arrangement of the subject has been  adopted. In the first place, an account of the two chief kinds of glass  is given, and of the peculiarities in the behaviour of each of them  before the blow-pipe, which is followed by a tolerably minute  description of the method of performing each of the fundamental  operations employed in fashioning glass apparatus. These are not very  numerous, and they should be thoroughly mastered in succession,  preferably upon tubes of both soda and lead glass. Then follows, in  Chapter IV., an account of the application of these operations to  setting up complete apparatus, full explanations of the construction of  two or three typical pieces of apparatus being given as examples, and  also descriptions of the modes of making various pieces of apparatus  which in each case present one or more special difficulties in their  construction; together with an account, which,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33965"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 4, July, 1851 (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net.

THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE    _Of Literature, Art, and Science._    Vol. III. NEW-YORK, JULY 1, 1851. No. IV.          FITZ-GREENE HALLECK.    [Illustration]      The author of _Fanny_, _Burns_, _Marco Bozzaris_, etc., was born at  Guilford in Connecticut, in August, 1795, and in his eighteenth year  removed to the city of New-York. He evinced a taste for poetry and wrote  verses at a very early period; but the oldest of his effusions I have  seen are those under the signatures of \"Croaker,\" and \"Croaker & Co.,\"  published in the _New-York Evening Post_, in 1819. In the production of  these pleasant satires he was associated with Doctor DRAKE, author of  the _Culprit Fay_, a man of brilliant wit and delicate fancy, with whom  he was long intimate. DRAKE died in 1820, and his friend soon after  wrote for the _New-York Review_, then edited by BRYANT, the lines to his  memory, beginning--        \"Green be the turf above thee,        Friend of my better days,      None knew thee but to love thee,        Nor named thee but to praise.\"    Near the close of 1819, Halleck published Fanny, his longest poem, which  was written and printed in three weeks; in 1827 a small volume,  containing Alnwick Castle, Marco Bozzaris, and a few other pieces, which  had previously appeared in various miscellanies; and in 1836, an edition  of all his serious and more finished compositions. The last and most  complete edition of his works appeared two years ago in a splendid  volume from the press of the Appletons.    It was Lord Byron's opinion that a poet is always to be ranked according  to his execution, and not according to his branch of the art. \"The poet  who executes best,\" said he, \"is the highest, whatever his department,  and will ever be so rated in the world's esteem.\" We have no doubt of  the justness of that remark; it is the only principle from which sound  criticism can proceed, and upon this basis the reputations of the past  have been made up. Considered in this light, Mr. Halleck must be  pronounced not merely one of the chief ornaments of new literature, but  one of the great masters in a language, classical and immortal, for the  productions of genius which have illustrated and enlarged its  capacities. There is in his compositions an essential pervading grace, a  natural brilliancy of wit, a freedom yet refinement of sentiment, a  sparkling flow of fancy, and a power of personification, combined with  such high and careful finish, and such exquisite nicety of taste, that  the larger part of them must be pronounced models almost faultless in  the classes to which they belong. They appear to me to show a genuine  insight into the principles of art, and a fine use of its resources: and  after all that has been said and written about nature, strength, and  originality, the true secret of fame, the real magic of genius is not  force, not passion, not novelty, but art. Look all through Milton; look  at the best passages of Shakspeare; look at the monuments, \"all Greek  and glorious,\" which have come down to us from ancient times, what  strikes us principally, and it might almost be said only, is the  wonderfully artificial character of the composition; it is the principle  of _their_ immortality, and without it no poem can be long-lived. It may  be easy to acquire popularity, and easy to display art in writing, but  he who obtains popularity by the means and employment of careful,  elaborate art, may be confident that his reputation is fixed upon a sure  basis. This--for his careless playing with the muse, by which one time  he kept the town alive, is scarcely remembered now--this, it seems to  me, Mr. Halleck has done; Mr. Halleck, Mr. Bryant, and Mr. Poe, have  done above all our authors.          THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS OF NEW-YORK.      No city in the world is more justly entitled to consideration for  active, judicious, and liberal benevolence, than New-York, though it  must be confessed that in some respects others may make a more splendid  display of the machinery of philanthropy, and even seem in the  subscriptions made every year to particular charities to be more  liberal. This is easily explained, by the fact that, while the people of  New-York are behind none in thrift and virtue, the great commercial  capital has nevertheless more than twice as much pauperism and crime,  from emigration and importation, as any other city in the world.  Foreigners who come here of their own will, foreigners who pay their own  passages to our country, are always welcome; but those who are banished  from their native places for crime, or deported for idleness,  imbecility, or any cause that renders them a burthen to the public,  should be shut out from our ports by some more efficient means than have  yet been devised for the purpose. This class alone demands of the  organized and individual benevolence of New-York a larger amount of  money every year than is paid for the relief of human wretchedness in  any other city.    The benevolent institutions of New-York are remarkable for their number,  so that in no department does an establishment indicate the attention  given to the particular necessities to which it is devoted; and not only  do the Quakers and the Jews, as in other places, take care of their own  poor, but almost every church, no matter of what denomination, is here a  well organized society for the relief of the unfortunate among its  members, and to a degree, within the sphere of its influence. Where  wealth has been acquired by its possessor, there is apt to be a generous  consideration for the less fortunate, and no city had ever so many of  the philanthropic merchants, of whom the late Samuel Ward was a type,  who are as judicious as they are liberal in shielding the oppressed,  strengthening the weak, and guiding the unwary, in pointing out ways and  furnishing means to the young who seem born to the inheritance of  degradation, and in saving others from sufferings caused by improvidence  or inevitable misfortune.    We propose no account of the humane societies of New-York, but only a  brief mention of some few of those whose edifices are most likely to  arrest the attention of strangers, as from several directions they  approach the city.    The Institution for the Blind is in the square bounded by Eighth and  Ninth Avenues and by Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth Streets, and is  built of marble. The society was founded by Mr. Samuel Wood, aided  largely by Dr. Samuel Ackerley, and was incorporated in 1831. In the  spring of the following year the managers reported that they had made  arrangements for instructing two or three blind children, \"by way of  experiment,\" and from that period the increase of its action and  resources has been constant. Pupils are received for one hundred and  thirty dollars a year, and the State has made provision for the  maintenance at the institution of one hundred and twenty-eight indigent  blind persons, so that it is always nearly full. The system of  instruction includes the common English studies, with philosophy and the  higher mathematics, mechanics, vocal and instrumental music, and, when  desired, such trades as the blind can advantageously practise. The  library contains more than seven hundred volumes in raised letters,  besides a considerable collection printed in ink. The occasional  exhibitions of the pupils have excited much attention, and the  institution may be regarded as altogether one of the most successful of  its kind in the world.    [Illustration: THE INSTITUTION FOR THE BLIND.]    In 1797 the celebrated Isabella Graham founded the Society for the  Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children, and in the spring of 1806,  Mrs. Alexander Hamilton, the widow of the great statesman, and Mrs.  Bethune, a daughter of Mrs. Graham and the mother of the Rev. Dr.  Bethune, with several associates, established, as a branch of that  institution, the Orphan Asylum of the City of New-York, which was  incorporated in 1807. Its first edifice was in Bank-street, but the  enlargement of its activity and resources in 1836 led to the purchase of  the ample and beautiful grounds near Eightieth-street, five miles from  the City Hall, from which the edifice described in the engraving looks  down on the Hudson, and forms one of the most picturesque views which  greet the traveller who approaches the city by the river from the north.  The eminent women whom we have mentioned continue, after nearly half a  century, to be active in its management.    [Illustration: THE ORPHAN ASYLUM.]    There is also a Protestant Half-Orphan Asylum in Sixth Avenue, a Roman  Catholic Orphan Asylum, conducted by Sisters of Charity, in Mott-street,  a Roman Catholic Half-Orphan Asylum in Eleventh-street, a very large  Colored Orphan Asylum in Twelfth-street, and several other  establishments of the same description, supported by public or private  charity, in different parts of the city. New-York is second only to  Philadelphia in the liberality of its provision for orphan children: the  college founded by Stephen Girard places the latter city in this respect  before any other in the world.    [Illustration: NEW-YORK INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB.]    The Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb was  incorporated in 1817, the first pupils were received in the following  year, and in 1827 the foundation was laid for the edifice now occupied  by the institution in Fiftieth street, near Fourth Avenue. Since 1831,  the President, Harvey P. Peet, LL.D. has had the chief direction of its  affairs, and its income, the number of its inmates, and its good  reputation, have rapidly increased.
