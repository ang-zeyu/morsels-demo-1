(2) Ascertain habitat preferences for the species found.    (3) Distinguish faunal associations existing in different parts of the  same stream.    (4) Describe differences and similarities among the fish faunas of the  several streams in the area.    (5) Relate the findings to the over-all picture of east-west  distribution of fishes in Kansas.    (6) List any demonstrable effects of intermittency of streams on fish  distribution within the area.    Cowley and Chautauqua counties form part of the southern border of  Kansas, and Elk County lies directly north of Chautauqua. The following  report concerns data only from those three counties unless otherwise  noted. They make up an area of 2,430 square miles having a population of  50,960 persons in 1950 (55,552 in 1940, and 60,375 in 1930). The most  populous portion of the area is western Cowley County where Arkansas  City with 12,903 inhabitants and Winfield with 10,264 inhabitants are  located. Each of the other towns has less than 2,000 inhabitants. In the  Flint Hills, which cross the central portion of the area surveyed,  population is sparse and chiefly in the valleys.    Topographically, the area is divisible into three general sections: the  extensive Wellington formation and the floodplain of the Arkansas River  in western Cowley County; the Flint Hills in the central part of the  area; and the \"Chautauqua Hills\" in the eastern part. The drainage  pattern is shown in Figure 1.    The Wellington formation, which is devoid of sharp relief, borders the  floodplain of the Arkansas River through most of its course in Cowley  County. A short distance south of Arkansas City, however, the Arkansas  is joined by the Walnut River and enters a narrow valley walled by  steep, wooded slopes. Frye and Leonard (1952:198) suggest that this  valley was originally carved by the Walnut River, when the Arkansas  River flowed southward west of its present course. They further suggest  that during Nebraskan glacial time the Arkansas probably was diverted to  the rapidly downcutting Walnut. The Arkansas River has a gradient of 3.0  ft. per mile in Cowley County. This gradient and others cited were  computed, by use of a cartometer, from maps made by the State Geological  Survey of Kansas and the United States Geological Survey.    Northward along the Walnut, steep bluffs and eroded gulleys characterize  both sides of the river, especially in southern Cowley County. Two  massive limestones, the Fort Riley and the Winfield, form the bluffs in  most places. The well-defined Winfield limestone is persistent on the  west bank of the river across the entire county. The Walnut has only a  few small tributaries in the southern half of Cowley County (Fig. 1). In  the northern half, however, it is joined from the east by Timber Creek  and Rock Creek. Timber Creek drains a large level area, formed by the  eroded upper portion of the Fort Riley limestone, in the north-central  portion of the county. The gradient of Timber Creek is 12.9 feet per  mile. The gradient of the Walnut River is only 2.3 ft. per mile from its  point of entrance into the county to its mouth.        [Illustration: FIG. 1.        Map of Cowley, Chautauqua and Elk counties, Kansas,        showing the streams mentioned in the text.]    Grouse Creek, like the Walnut, has formed a valley of one to three miles  in width, rimmed by prominent wooded bluffs. Those on the west side are  capped by the Fort Riley limestone with the resistant Wreford and Crouse  limestones forming lower escarpments. On the east side the Wreford and  Crouse limestones provide the only escarpments along the stream above  the Vinton community, except for occasional lower outcrops of Morrill  limestone. Below Vinton the Fort Riley limestone again appears, capping  the hills above the Wreford limestone. The headwaters of the western  tributaries of Grouse Creek are generally in the Doyle shale formation;  the eastern tributaries are in the Wreford limestone, Matfield shale,  and Barnestone limestone formations. The gradient of Grouse Creek is 9  ft. per mile, of Silver Creek 14.6 ft. per mile, and of Crab Creek 14.4  ft. per mile.    The Big Caney River (Fig. 1), having a gradient of 15.4 ft. per mile in  the area studied, drains an area with considerable geological and  topographic variation. The main stream and its western tributaries  originate in Permian formations, whereas the eastern tributaries  originate in Pennsylvanian formations. Cedar Creek is exemplary of  western tributaries of Big Caney. This creek arises in the Wreford  limestone, as do several nearby tributaries of Grouse Creek. Although  the Grouse tributaries descend through only part of the Council Grove  group, Cedar Creek flows downward through the entire Grove, Admire, and  Wabaunsee groups and part of the Shawnee Group (Moore, 1951). In only 15  miles, Cedar Creek traverses formations comprising more than 60 per cent  of the entire exposed stratigraphic section in Cowley County. Bass  (1929:16) states that reliefs of 350 feet within a mile are present in  parts of this area.    Large terraces of limestone characterize the eastern flank of the Flint  Hills, which the western tributaries of Big Caney drain. Most striking  is the Foraker limestone. It characteristically consists of three  massive members in Cowley County, the uppermost of which forms the  prominent first crest of the Flint Hills. As the rapid-flowing western  tributaries of Big Caney descend over these successive limestone  members, large quantities of chert and limestone rubble are transported  and deposited in stream beds of the system. In many places the streams  of the Big Caney system flow over resistant limestone members, which  form a bedrock bottom. The eastern tributaries of Big Caney drain, for  the most part, formations of the Wabaunsee group of the Pennsylvanian.  Most of these streams have lower gradients than those entering Big Caney  from the west. The tributaries of Big Caney, along with length in miles  and gradient in feet per mile, are as follows: Spring Creek, 7.1, 54.5;  Union Creek, 6.3, 42.9; Otter Creek, 14.6, 27.4; Cedar Creek, 11.6,  31.0; Rock Creek, 15.9, 26.5; Wolf Creek, 9.3, 17.2; Turkey Creek, 8.5,  26.4; Grant Creek, 13.9, 23.4; and Sycamore Creek, 8.9, 27.0.    Spring Creek and Union Creek are short and have formed no extensive  floodplain. The high gradients of these creeks are characteristic also  of the upper portions of several other tributaries such as Cedar Creek  and Otter Creek.    Middle Caney Creek (Fig. 1) has its source in the Wabaunsee and Shawnee  groups of the Pennsylvanian but its watershed is dominated by the  \"Chautauqua Hills\" of the Douglas Group. This area is described by Moore  (1949:127) as \"an upland formed by hard sandstone layers.\" The rough  rounded hills supporting thick growths of oaks differ in appearance from  both the Big Caney watershed on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34532"],[0,"A Synopsis of the American Bats of the Genus Pipistrellus (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                                       A Synopsis of the American Bats                        of the Genus Pipistrellus                                      BY                    E.

RAYMOND HALL AND WALTER W. DALQUEST      Four nominal species of the genus _Pipistrellus_ are currently  recognized in North America. They are _Pipistrellus subflavus_  (F. Cuvier) of eastern North America, _Pipistrellus hesperus_ (H. Allen)  of western North America, _Pipistrellus veracrucis_ (Ward) from  Veracruz, Mexico, and _Pipistrellus cinnamomeus_ Miller from Tabasco,  Mexico.    In the past three years, specimens have been obtained in Veracruz (by  Dalquest) of each of the southern species. One of these, _P.  cinnamomeus_, previously was known from a single specimen; the other,  _P. veracrucis_, was known only from six specimens which now are lost  or misplaced. The results of our study of these recently acquired  Mexican specimens constitute our principal contribution in this paper;  we have done little more with the material from the United States and  Canada than to codify the findings of other mammalogists with respect  to the systematic status and geographic distribution.    Study of the available specimens reveals that there are only two  species, _Pipistrellus hesperus_ and _Pipistrellus subflavus_;  _Pipistrellus veracrucis_ proves to be only a subspecies (geographic  race) of _P. subflavus_, and _Pipistrellus cinnamomeus_ proves to be a  species of another genus, _Myotis_ (see Hall and Dalquest, page 583 of  this volume).

Their geographic  ranges, as now known, meet, but do not overlap. Certain differences  between the two species are listed in the parallel columns below. Most  of these differences in the skull and teeth are illustrated in figures  22 and 23 on page 92 of Miller's \"Revision of the North American bats  of the family Vespertilionidae (N. Amer. Fauna, 13, 1897).\"        ======================================================================    Structure           | _P. hesperus_           | _P. subflavus_    ======================================================================    Color               | Predominately gray      | Predominately brown    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    Foot                | Less than half as long  | More than half as long                        | as tibia                | as tibia    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    Thumb, length of    | Less than 4.9 mm.       | More than 4.9 mm.    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    Tragus              | Blunt, terminal part    | Narrow, straight                        | bent forward            |    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    Skull               | Nearly straight         | Dish-faced    (dorsal profile)    |                         |    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    Braincase           | Small                   | Large    (viewed from above) |                         |    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    Palate              | Extending far behind    | Extending short                        | molars; spine short,    | distance behind                        |                         | molars; spine long,                        | narrow at base          | wide at base    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    I2                  | Unicuspidate            | Bicuspidate    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    I3                  | Accessory cusp present  | Accessory cusp absent                        | on anterointernal       | on anterointernal                        | face                    | face    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    P1 (occlusal view)  | Less than a seventh as  | More than a seventh                        | large as canine         | as large as canine    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    P1 (labial view)    | Concealed by C1 and P4  | Not concealed    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    P4                  | Touching canine         | Not touching canine    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    i3                  | Touching i2 and c1      | Separated by space                        |                         | from i2 and c1    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    p3                  | Lower than anterior     | As high as anterior                        | cusp of canine          | cusp of canine    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------    Distance from c1    | Less than length of m2; | More than length of    to m1               | premolars crowded       | m2; premolars less                        |                         | crowded    --------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------      +Pipistrellus hesperus+    (Synonomy under subspecies)    _Range._--Arid Sonoran life-zones of western North America from  Washington southward to Jalisco.    _Characters._--Smoke Gray to Buff Brown (Capitalized color terms after  Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C.,  1912) dorsally; total length, 60 to 86; foot less than half as long as  tibia; tragus blunt with terminal part bent forward; skull nearly  straight in dorsal profile; inner upper incisor unicuspidate; outer  upper incisor with accessory cusp on anterointernal face; P1, viewed  from occlusal face, less than a seventh of area of canine, and from  labial aspect concealed by canine and fourth premolar; lower, third  premolar lower than anterior cusp of canine; lower premolars crowded,  distance between canine and first molar less than length of second  lower molar.    _Remarks._--In the United States and in the northern part of Mexico,  _P. hesperus_ is the smallest bat found. Little is known about its  habits. It emerges earlier in the evening than other species of bats.  The frequency with which it is seen near cliffs suggests that it finds  concealment under rocks. In winter, in Nevada (Hall, Mammals of  Nevada, p. 150, 1946), _P. hesperus_ has been found singly in crevices  in the roofs of mine tunnels.    In the United States National Museum in July, 1949, the specimen  providing the easternmost record station of occurrence was examined by  us. This is No. 23591, in alcohol, taken on August 24, 1890, by  William Lloyd, original No. 88, at the mouth of the Pecos River in  Texas. In the same collection there is a specimen of _Pipistrellus  subflavus_ providing the westernmost record of occurrence of that  species. This specimen, a skin with skull, is No. 126729, [Male],  taken on May 3, 1903, by Jas. H. Gaut, original No. 1271, at Comstock,  Texas. The two localities concerned are in the Valley of the Rio  Grande, and are only about five miles apart. Nevertheless, the two  specimens are clearly referable to their respective species and show  no tendency toward intergradation. Consequently, confidence is felt in  treating _Pipistrellus hesperus_ and _Pipistrellus subflavus_ as two  distinct species.    The most recent report upon geographic variation throughout the entire  species, _Pipistrellus hesperus_, was that by Hatfield (Jour. Mamm.,  17:257-262, August 14, 1936). Later, as explained below in the account  of _P. h. australis_, Burt (Miscl. Publ., Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan,  39:25, February 15, 1938) examined specimens from Sonora, Mexico, and  for them and for specimens from southern Arizona proposed a different  nomenclatural arrangement.        "]]]
