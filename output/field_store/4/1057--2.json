RAYMOND HALL      The most popular small game mammal in nearly every part of North America  is one or another of the species of rabbits or hares. The rabbit is one  of the few species of wild game that still is hunted commercially and  sold for food on the open market. The close association and repeated  contact of man with these animals has resulted in his contracting such  of their diseases as are transmissible to him. Consequently the rabbits  and hares have figured in many investigations concerned with public  health and medicine. Because the number of such investigations is  increasing, there has been an increasing number of specimens of these  animals submitted to mammalogists for identification; also, inquiries  are received as to the degree of relationship between two or more of the  named kinds of rabbits in which identical, or closely related, disease  organisms have been found; other inquiries have to do with the degree of  relationship of named kinds of rabbits and hares in widely separated  parts of the continent.    The monographs to which the investigator could turn to obtain answers to  some of these questions are Arthur H. Howell's \"Revision of the American  Pikas\" (1924), and Edward H. Nelson's \"The Rabbits of North America\"  (1909) published 27 and 42 years ago, respectively. These monographs are  still excellent sources of detailed information, as, of course, also is  Marcus Ward Lyon's \"Classification of the Hares and their Allies\"  (1904). The acquisition of additional study specimens in recent years,  however, has provided new data on the geographic occurrence of several  species, and study of these specimens has given basis for a different  arrangement of several named kinds of the lagomorphs. Two principal aims  of the present synopsis, therefore, are to combine in one publication  the current taxonomic arrangement and as much as is known of the  geographic distribution of the several species and subspecies.    The maps herewith and listings of marginal localities are the means  chosen to present the information on geographic distribution. The  artificial key is supplemented by line drawings of skulls of certain  species and by a minimum of text to aid the user of the key. The skulls  are necessary for the identification of some species of the genus  _Sylvilagus_. The skins, on the contrary, are essential for the  identification of the species of the genus _Lepus_ in central Mexico and  in the Great Basin of the western United States. Consequently, it has  been impossible to construct a key based on external characters only or  on cranial features only. Furthermore, the only apparent differences  between a given pair of species in one region may not be apparent in  another region where the same two species occur together. A case in  point is provided by _Sylvilagus floridanus_ and _Sylvilagus nuttallii_  where the Great Plains meet the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains and  where the Sonoran desert meets the southwestern flank of these  mountains. The details are described by Hall and Kelson (1951:52, 53)  and are indicated in the part of the accompanying artificial key that  takes out the species _Sylvilagus nuttallii_. Because of this geographic  change in specific characters and because of the slight amount of  difference between certain species of leporids, I have frequently  resorted to geography, instead of to morphology alone, in constructing  the artificial key. Despite this fault of the key to the lagomorphs, it,  and the accompanying account, I hope, will aid workers who need to  identify kinds of lagomorphs and to know about their geographic  distribution.    Another reason for presenting a synopsis of the lagomorphs at this time  is that the presentation may bring suggestions for improvement in the  arrangement of the kind of information presented here; an account along  similar lines for all of the kinds of mammals native to North America is  in prospect. Corrections of, and additions to, the material presented  here will be welcomed and I shall be especially grateful for suggestions  as to a more useful arrangement of the data.    In arranging the families, genera and species the aim has been, in each  category, to list the most primitive members first and to list last the  one which presents the highest total of specialization. The term _total  of specialization_ is used here,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32455"],[0,"Christmas Eve and Christmas Day: Ten Christmas stories (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

CAMBRIDGE:      PRESS OF JOHN WILSON AND SON.          PREFACE.      This is a collection of ten Christmas Stories, some of which have been  published before. I have added a little essay, written on the occasion  of the first Christmas celebrated by the King of Italy in Rome.    The first story has never before been published.    It is but fair to say that I have not drawn on imagination for Laura's  night duty, alone upon her island. This is simply the account of what a  brave New-England woman did, under like circumstances, because it was  the duty next her hand.    If any reader observes a resemblance between her position and that of a  boy in another story in this volume, I must disarm censure, by saying,  that she had never heard of him when she was called to this duty, and  that I had never heard of her when I wrote his story.

CHAPTER I.    ANOTHER GENERATION.    \"Here he comes! here he comes!\"    \"He\" was the \"post-rider,\" an institution now almost of the past. He  rode by the house and threw off a copy of the \"Boston Gazette.\" Now the  \"Boston Gazette,\" of this particular issue, gave the results of the  drawing of the great Massachusetts State Lottery of the Eastern Lands in  the Waldo Patent.    Mr. Cutts, the elder, took the \"Gazette,\" and opened it with a smile  that pretended to be careless; but even he showed the eager anxiety  which they all felt, as he tore off the wrapper and unfolded the fatal  sheet. \"Letter from London,\" \"Letter from Philadelphia,\" \"Child with two  heads,\"--thus he ran down the columns of the little page,--uneasily.  \"Here it is! here it is!--Drawing of the great State Lottery. 'In the  presence of the Honourable Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and of their  Honours the Commissioners of the Honourable Council,--was drawn  yesterday, at the State House, the first distribution of  numbers'----here are the numbers,--'First combination, 375-1. Second,  421-7. Third, 591-6. Fourth, 594-1. Fifth,'\"--and here Mr. Cutts started  off his feet,--\"'Fifth, 219-7.' Sybil, my darling! it is so! 219-7! See,  dear child! 219-7! 219-7! O my God! to think it should come so!\"    And he fairly sat down, and buried his head in his hands, and cried.    The others, for a full minute, did not dare break in on excitement so  intense, and were silent; but, in a minute more, of course, little  Simeon, the youngest of the tribes who were represented there, gained  courage to pick up the paper, and to spell out again the same words  which his father had read with so much emotion; and, with his sister  Sally, who came to help him, to add to the store of information, as to  what prize number 5--219-7--might bring.    For this was a lottery in which there were no blanks. The old  Commonwealth of Massachusetts, having terrible war debts to pay after  the Revolution, had nothing but lands in Maine to pay them with. Now  lands in Maine were not very salable, and, if the simple and ordinary  process of sale had been followed, the lands might not have been sold  till this day. So they were distributed by these Lotteries, which in  that time seemed gigantic. Every ticket-holder had some piece of land  awarded to him, I think,--but to the most, I fear, the lands were hardly  worth the hunting up, to settle upon. But, to induce as many to buy as  might, there were prizes. No. 1, I think, even had a \"stately mansion\"  on the land,--according to the advertisement. No. 2 had some special  water-power facilities. No. 5, which Mr. Cutts's ticket had drawn, was  two thousand acres on Tripp's Cove,--described in the programme as that  \"well-known Harbor of Refuge, where Fifty Line of Battle Ship could lie  in safety.\" To this cove the two thousand acres so adjoined that the  programme represented them as the site of the great \"Mercantile  Metropolis of the Future.\"    Samuel Cutts was too old a man, and had already tested too critically  his own powers in what the world calls \"business,\" by a sad satire, to  give a great deal of faith to the promises of the prospectus, as to the  commercial prosperity of Tripp's Cove. He had come out of the Revolution  a Brigadier-General, with an honorable record of service,--with  rheumatism which would never be cured,--with a good deal of paper money  which would never be redeemed, which the Continent and the Commonwealth  had paid him for his seven years,--and without that place in the world  of peace which he had had when these years began. The very severest  trial of the Revolution was to be found in the condition in which the  officers of the army were left after it was over. They were men who had  distinguished themselves in their profession, and who had done their  very best to make that profession unnecessary in the future. To go back  to their old callings was hard. Other men were in their places, and  there did not seem to be room for two. Under the wretched political  system of the old Confederation there was no such rapid spring of the  material prosperity of the country as should find for them new fields in  new enterprise. Peace did any thing but lead in Plenty. Often indeed, in  history, has Plenty been a little coy before she could be tempted, with  her pretty tender feet, to press the stubble and the ashes left by the  havoc of War. And thus it was that General Cutts had returned to his old  love whom he had married in a leave of absence just before Bunker Hill,  and had begun his new life with her in Old Newbury in Massachusetts, at  a time when there was little opening for him,--or for any man who had  spent seven years in learning how to do well what was never to be done  again.    And in doing what there was to do he had not succeeded. He had just  squeezed pork and potatoes and Indian meal enough out of a worn-out farm  to keep Sybil, his wife, and their growing family of children alive. He  had, once or twice, gone up to Boston to find what chances might be open  for him there. But, alas, Boston was in a bad way too, as well as Samuel  Cutts. Once he had joined some old companions, who had gone out to the  Western Reserve in Northern Ohio, to see what opening might be there.  But the outlook seemed unfavorable for carrying so far, overland, a  delicate woman and six little children into a wilderness. If he could  have scraped together a little money, he said, he would buy a share in  one of the ships he saw rotting in Boston or Salem, and try some  foreign adventure. But, alas! the ships would not have been rotting had  it been easy for any man to scrape together a little money to buy them.  And so, year in and year out, Samuel Cutts and his wife dressed the  children more and more plainly, bought less sugar and more molasses,  brought down the family diet more strictly to pork and beans, pea-soup,  hasty-pudding, and rye-and-indian,--and Samuel Cutts looked more and  more sadly on the prospect before these boys and girls, and the life for  which he was training them.    Do not think that he was a profligate, my dear cousin Eunice, because he  had bought a lottery ticket. Please to observe that to buy lottery  tickets was represented to be as much the duty of all good citizens, as  it was proved to be, eleven years ago, your duty to make Havelocks and  to knit stockings. Samuel Cutts, in the outset, had bought his lottery  ticket only \"to encourage the others,\" and to do his honorable share in  paying the war debt. Then, I must confess, he had thought more of the  ticket than he had supposed he would. The children had made a romance  about it,--what they would do, and what they would not do, if they drew  the first prize. Samuel Cutts and Sybil Cutts themselves had got drawn  into the interest of the children, and many was the night when they had  sat up, without any light but that of a pine-torch, planning out the  details of the little colony they would form at the East-ward,--if--if  only one of the ten great prizes should, by any marvel, fall to him. And  now Tripp's Cove--which, perhaps, he had thought of as much as he had  thought of any of the ten--had fallen to him. This was the reason why he  showed so much emotion, and why he could hardly speak, when he read the  numbers. It was because that had come to him which represented so  completely what he wanted, and yet which he had not even dared to pray  for. It was so much more than he expected,--it was the dream of years,  indeed, made true.    For Samuel Cutts had proved to himself that he was a good leader of men.  He knew he was, and many men knew it who had followed him under Carolina"]]]
