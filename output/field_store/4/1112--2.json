The similarities  in size, proportions, and coloration of the different species have  resulted not so much in a multiplicity of specific names, but in  differences of opinion on the application of existing names to the  various taxa. For example, the populations on the Atlantic lowlands  have been known by three names, two of which have been applied to  other taxa. Much of the confusion has been the result of previous  workers' unfamiliarity with the animals in life and unawareness of the  intraspecific geographic variation in the most widespread species.    Independently we undertook studies of these frogs in the field. The  second author worked on the interspecific relationships and isolating  mechanisms in Panama (Fouquette, 1960b) and later studied the species  in southern Mexico. As part of his survey of the hylids of Middle  America, the first author accumulated field and laboratory data on the  frogs throughout their ranges in Mexico and Central America. The  purpose of this report is to present our findings on the four species  of Middle American frogs that we place in the _Hyla microcephala_  group. In addition to conventional taxonomic characters, we have  utilized the features of the cranial osteology and have relied heavily  on the data obtained from an analysis of the mating calls.  Furthermore, we have included ecological and distributional data in  our synthesis of interspecific relationships.      ACKNOWLEDGMENTS    Examination of specimens was made possible by the provision of working  space at various institutions or through the loan of specimens. For  their generosity in this manner we are grateful to Richard J. Baldauf,  Charles M. Bogert, James E. Boehlke, Doris M. Cochran, Robert F. Inger,  John M. Legler, Alan E. Leviton, Gerald Raun, Jay M. Savage, Hobart M.  Smith, Robert C. Stebbins, Wilmer W. Tanner, Charles F. Walker, Ernest  E. Williams, and Richard G. Zweifel.    Duellman is especially grateful to Charles W. Myers, Linda Trueb,  Jerome B. Tulecke, and John Wellman for their assistance in the field  and to Linda Trueb for her work on the cranial osteology that is  incorporated in this report. Fouquette is indebted to H. Morgan Smith  and A. C. Collins for assistance in the field, to A. J. Delahoussaye  for assistance in the laboratory, and to W. Frank Blair for use of the  facilities of the sound laboratory at the University of Texas and for  much help in the early stages of this study.    The research reported herein was accomplished mainly through support  by the National Science Foundation (grants NSF G-9827 and GB-1441 to  Duellman and GB-599 to Fouquette). The latter's field work in Mexico  was assisted in part by NSF Grant G-4956 to W. Frank Blair. Some of  the field studies carried out in Panama by Duellman were supported by  a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH GM-12020).    We are grateful to many persons, too numerous to mention, who in  various ways aided our field work in Middle America. We are especially  indebted to Dr. Rodolfo Hernandez Corzo and the late Ing. Luis Macias  Arellano of the Direccion General de la Fauna Silvestre of the Mexican  government for providing permits to collect in Mexico.      Materials and Methods    For this report, data has been obtained from 2829 preserved frogs, 42  skeletal preparations, 8 lots of tadpoles and young, and 4 lots of  eggs. Much of the material was collected in our independent field  work, which has extended over a period of 11 years.    Measurements were taken in the manner described by Duellman (1956).  Osteological data were obtained from specimens that were cleared in  potassium hydroxide, stained with alizarin red, and stored in  glycerine. Recordings were made by means of Magnemite portable tape  recorders (Amplifier Corp. America). The calls recorded by Fouquette  were analyzed on a Sonagraph (Kay Electric Co.) at the University of  Texas; those recorded by Duellman were analyzed mainly on a Vibralyzer  (Kay Electric Co.) at the University of Kansas and in part on a  Sonagraph at the University of Southwestern Louisiana. Sample calls  were analyzed on all three instruments; the slight differences in  results were found to be less than the error in measurement, so the  data from all sources were combined without correction. The techniques  and terminology of the calls are those defined by Fouquette (1960a,  1960b).    In the accounts of the species we have attempted to give a complete  synonymy. At the end of each species account the localities from which  specimens were examined are listed alphabetically within each state,  province, or department, which in turn are listed alphabetically  within each country. The countries are arranged from north to south.  Localities preceded by an asterisk (*) are not plotted on the  accompanying maps due to the crowding of symbols that would have  resulted.

But we work harder, accomplish more in a  given time, and last quite as long as slower races. As to the gray  hair--perhaps gray hair is better than none; and it is a fact that the  average Briton becomes bald as early as the American turns gray. There  is, however, a sad significance in his words when he says: \"In every  circle I have met men who had themselves suffered from nervous collapse  due to stress of business, or named friends who had either killed  themselves by overwork, or had been permanently incapacitated, or had  wasted long periods in endeavors to recover health.\" Too true. And it is  the constant strain, without let-up or relaxation, that, in nine cases  out of ten, snaps the cord and ends in what the doctors call \"nervous  prostration\"--something akin to paralysis--from which the sufferer  seldom wholly recovers.    Mr. Spencer quotes that quaint old chronicler, Froissart, as saying,  \"The English take their pleasures sadly, after their fashion\"; and  thinks if he lived now, he would say of Americans, \"they take their  pleasures hurriedly, after their fashion.\" Perhaps.    It is an age of hurry and worry. Anything slower than steam is apt to  \"get left.\" Fortunes are quickly made and freely spent. Nearly all  busy, hard-worked Americans have an intuitive sense of the need that  exists for at least one period of rest and relaxation during each year,  and all--or nearly all--are willing to pay liberally, too liberally in  fact, for anything that conduces to rest, recreation and sport. I am  sorry to say that we mostly get swindled. As an average, the summer  outer who goes to forest, lake or stream for health and sport, gets  about ten cents' worth for a dollar of outlay. A majority will admit--to  themselves at least--that after a month's vacation, they return to work  with an inward consciousness of being somewhat disappointed--and beaten.  We are free with our money when we have it. We are known throughout the  civilized world for our lavishness in paying for our pleasures; but it  humiliates us to know we have been beaten, and this is what the most of  us know at the end of a summer vacation. To the man of millions it makes  little difference. He is able to pay liberally for boats, buckboards and  \"body service,\" if he chooses to spend a summer in the North Woods. He  has no need to study the questions of lightness and economy in a forest  and stream outing. Let his guides take care of him; and unto them and  the landlords he will give freely of his substance.    I do not write for him, and can do him little good. But there are  hundreds of thousands of practical, useful men, many of them far from  being rich; mechanics, artists, writers, merchants, clerks, business  men--workers, so to speak--who sorely need and well deserve a season of  rest and relaxation at least once a year. To these, and for these, I  write.    Perhaps more than fifty years of devotion to \"woodcraft\" may enable me  to give a few useful hints and suggestions to those whose dreams, during  the close season of work, are of camp-life by flood, field and forest.    I have found that nearly all who have a real love of nature and  out-of-door camp-life, spend a good deal of time and talk in planning  future trips, or discussing the trips and pleasures gone by, but still  dear to memory.        When the mountain streams are frozen and the Nor'land winds are out;    when the winter winds are drifting the bitter sleet and snow; when  winter rains are making out-of-door life unendurable; when season,  weather and law combine to make it \"close time\" for beast, bird and man,  it is well that a few congenial spirits should, at some favorite  trysting place, gather around the glowing stove and exchange yarns,  opinions and experiences. Perhaps no two will exactly agree on the best  ground for an outing, on the flies, rods, reels, guns, etc., or half a  dozen other points that may be discussed. But one thing all admit. Each  and every one has gone to his chosen ground with too much impedimenta,  too much duffle; and nearly all have used boats at least twice as heavy  as they need to have been. The temptation to buy this or that bit of  indispensable camp-kit has been too strong, and we have gone to the  blessed woods, handicapped with a load fit for a pack-mule. This is not  how to do it.    Go light; the lighter the better, so that you have the simplest material  for health, comfort and enjoyment.    Of course, if you intend to have a permanent camp, and can reach it by  boat or wagon, lightness is not so important, though even in that case  it is well to guard against taking a lot of stuff that is likely to  prove of more weight than worth--only to leave it behind when you come  out.    [Sidenote: Clothing]    As to clothing for the woods, a good deal of nonsense has been written  about \"strong, coarse woolen clothes.\" You do not want coarse woolen  clothes. Fine woolen cassimere of medium thickness for coat, vest and  pantaloons, with no cotton lining. Color, slate gray or dead-leaf  (either is good). Two soft, thick woolen shirts; two pairs of fine, but  substantial, woolen drawers; two pairs of strong woolen socks or  stockings; these are what you need, and all you need in the way of  clothing for the woods, excepting hat and boots, or gaiters. Boots are  best--providing you do not let yourself be inveigled into wearing a pair  of long-legged heavy boots with thick soles, as has been often advised  by writers who knew no better. Heavy, long-legged boots are a weary,  tiresome incumbrance on a hard tramp through rough woods. Even moccasins  are better. Gaiters, all sorts of high shoes, in fact, are too  bothersome about fastening and unfastening. Light boots are best. Not  thin, unserviceable affairs, but light as to actual weight.
