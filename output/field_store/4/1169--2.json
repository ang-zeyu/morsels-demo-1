Puffer          PREFACE    THE human being who thrills to the experience of beauty in  nature and in art does not forever rest with that experience  unquestioned.  The day comes when he yearns to pierce the  secret of his emotion, to discover what it is, and why, that  has so stung him--to defend and to justify his transport to  himself and to others.  He seeks a reason for the faith that  is in him.  And so have arisen the speculative theories of  the nature of beauty, on the one hand, and the studies of  concrete beauty and our feelings about it, on the other.  Speculative theory has taken its own way, however, as a  part of philosophy, in relating the Beautiful to the other  great concepts of the True and the Good; building up an  architectonic of abstract ideas, far from the immediate  facts and problems of the enjoyment of beauty.  There has  grown up, on the other hand, in the last years, a great  literature of special studies in the facts of aesthetic  production and enjoyment.  Experiments with the aesthetic  elements; investigations into the physiological psychology  of aesthetic reactions; studies in the genesis and development  of art forms, have multiplied apace.  But these are still  mere groups of facts for psychology; they have not been taken  up into a single authoritative principle.  Psychology cannot  do justice to the imperative of beauty, by virtue of which,  when we say \"this is beautiful,\" we have a right to imply  that the universe must agree with us.  A synthesis of these  tendencies in the study of beauty is needed, in which the  results of modern psychology shall help to make intelligible  a philosophical theory of beauty.  The chief purpose of this  book is to seek to effect such a union.    A way of defining Beauty which grounds it in general principles,  while allowing it to reach the concrete case, is set forth in  the essay on the Nature of Beauty.  The following chapters aim  to expand, to test, and to confirm this central theory, by  showing, partly by the aid of the aforesaid special studies,  how it accounts for our pleasure in pictures, music, and  literature.    The whole field of beauty is thus brought under discussion;  and therefore, though it nowhere seeks to be exhaustive in  treatment, the book may fairly claim to be a more or less  consistent and complete aesthetic theory, and hence to  address itself to the student of aesthetics as well as to the  general reader.  The chapter on the Nature of Beauty, indeed,  will doubtless be found by the latter somewhat technical, and  should be omitted by all who definitely object to professional  phraseology.  The general conclusions of the book are  sufficiently stated in the less abstract papers.    Of the essays which compose the following volume, the first,  third, and last are reprinted, in more or less revised form,  from the \"Atlantic Monthly\" and the \"International Monthly.\"  Although written as independent papers, it is thought that  they do not unduly repeat each other, but that they serve to  verify, in each of the several realms of beauty, the truth  of the central theory of the book.    The various influences which have served to shape a work of  this kind become evident in the reading; but I cannot refrain  from a word of thanks to the teachers whose inspiration and  encouragement first made it possible.  I owe much gratitude  to Professor Mary A. Jordan and Professor H. Norman Gardiner  of Smith College, who in literature and in philosophy first  set me in the way of aesthetic interest and inquiry, and to  Professor Hugo Munsterberg of Harvard University, whose  philosophical theories and scientific guidance have largely  influenced my thought.

France being the only  country in the world where criticism is a serious matter,  the battle waged most fiercely there, and doubtless greatly  served to bring about the present general interest and  understanding of the theoretical questions at issue.  The  combatants were, of course, the impressionistic and scientific  schools of criticism, and particularly enlightening were the  more or less recent controversies between MM. Anatole France  and Jules Lemaitre as representatives of the first, and M.  Brunetiere as the chief exponent of the second.  They have  planted their standards; and we see that they stand for  tendencies in the critical activity of every nation.  The  ideal of the impressionist is to bring a new piece of  literature into being in some exquisitely happy characterization,--  to create a lyric of criticism out of the unique pleasure of  an aesthetic hour.  The stronghold of the scientist, on the  other hand, is the doctrine of literary evolution, and his  aim is to show the history of literature as the history of  a process, and the work of literature as a product; to explain  it from its preceding causes, and to detect thereby the general  laws of literary metamorphosis.    Such are the two great lines of modern criticism; their purposes  and ideals stand diametrically opposed.  Of late, however, there  have not been wanting signs of a spirit of reconciliation, and  of a tendency to concede the value, each in its own sphere, of  different but complementary activities.  Now and again the  lion and the lamb have lain down together; one might almost say,  on reading a delightful paper of Mr. Lewis E. Gates on  Impressionism and Appreciation,<1> that the lamb had assimilated  the lion.  For the heir of all literary studies, according to  Professor Gates, is the appreciative critic; and he it is who  shall fulfill the true function of criticism.  He is to  consider the work of art in its historical setting and its  psychological origin, \"as a characteristic moment in the  development of human spirit, and as a delicately transparent  illustration of aesthetic law.\"  But, \"in regarding the work  of art under all these aspects, his aim is, primarily, not to  explain, and not to judge or dogmatize, but to enjoy; to  realize the manifold charms the work of art has gathered unto  itself from all sources, and to interpret this charm imaginatively  to the men of his own day and generation.\"    <1> Atlantic Monthly, July, 1900.    Thus it would seem that if the report of his personal reactions  to a work of literary art is the intention of the impressionist,  and its explanation that of the scientist, the purpose of the  appreciative critic is fairly named as the illuminating and  interpreting reproduction of that work, from material furnished  by those other forms of critical activity.  Must, then, the  method of appreciation, as combining and reconciling the two  opposed views, forthwith claim our adherence?  To put to use  all the devices of science and all the treasures of scholarship  for the single end of imaginative interpretation, for the sake  of giving with the original melody all the harmonies of subtle  association and profound meaning the ages have added, is, indeed,  a great undertaking.  But is it as valuable as it is vast?  M.  Brunetiere has poured out his irony upon the critics who believe  that their own reactions upon literature are anything to us in  the presence of the works to which they have thrilled.  May it  not also be asked of the interpreter if its function is a  necessary one?  Do we require so much enlightenment, only to  enjoy?  Appreciative criticism is a salt to give the dull  palate its full savor; but what literary epicure, what real  boo-lover, will acknowledge his own need of it?  If the whole  aim of appreciative criticism is to reproduce in other  arrangement the contents, expressed and implied, and the  emotional value, original and derived, of a piece of literature,  the value of the end, at least to the intelligent reader, is  out of all proportion to the laboriousness of the means.  Sing,  reading's a joy!  For me, I read.    But a feeling of this kind is, after all, not a reason to be  urged against the method.  The real weakness of appreciative  criticism lies elsewhere.  It teaches us to enjoy; but are we  to enjoy everything?  Since its only aim is to reveal the  \"intricate implications\" of a work of art; since it offers,  and professes to offer, no literary judgments,--having indeed  no explicit standard of literary value,--it must, at least  on its own theory, take its objects of appreciation ready-made,  so to speak, by popular acclaim.  It possesses no criterion;  it likes whate'er it looks on; and it can never tell us what  we are not to like.  That is unsatisfactory; and it is worse,--  it is self-destructive.  For, not being able to reject,  appreciation cannot, in logic, choose the objects of its  attention.  But a method which cannot limit on its own principles  the field within which it is to work is condemned from the  beginning; it bears a fallacy at its core.  In order to make  criticism theoretically possible at all, the power to choose  and reject, and so the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37512"],[0,"A Revision of Snakes of the Genus Conophis (Family Colubridae, from Middle (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                Transcriber's Note    Typographical corrections are listed at the end of this version.

Since these snakes  appeared to be of zoogeographic importance in the Central American  region, I undertook the review as set forth on the following pages.

Duellman supplied invaluable information and guidance  in my study. I am grateful to Prof. E. Raymond Hall for use of  facilities of the Museum of Natural History and editorial assistance.  I thank Prof. Laurence C. Stuart and Prof. Edward H. Taylor for  information and suggestions. My own field experience in Middle America  came as a result of assisting Professor Duellman in his own researches  supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF-G  9827). For these things I am deeply grateful. Specimens that I have  seen alive were collected by field companions Dale L. Hoyt and Jerome  B. Tulecke. Finally, I am grateful to my wife, Margaret L. Wellman,  for much help including typing much of the manuscript.          MATERIALS AND METHODS      Of the 325 specimens of the genus _Conophis_ available to me,  representing most of those in museum collections, scale counts were  made in the usual manner on 309. Ventrals were counted following the  system proposed by Dowling (1951:97-99); the anal plate was not  included. The anteroposterior position of the place where reduction  occurs in the number of the dorsal rows of scales is designated by  citing the number of the ventral scale directly beneath that place.    Measurements were taken to the nearest millimeter by means of a  millimeter stick. Body length is the distance from the tip of the  snout to the posterior edge of the anal plate; tail length, from the  latter point to the tip of the tail; and total length, the sum of the  body plus tail.    Descriptions of color are based on preserved specimens. Where  descriptions of the color of living individuals are given, the data  were taken from Kodachrome slides made available to me by William E.  Duellman. Due to the transient nature of the longitudinal dark stripes  in these snakes, no standard terminology has been devised, except that  the posterior continuations of the stripes which on the head pass  through the eye are termed lateral stripes; the posterior  continuations of the median stripe of the head are termed  dorsolateral stripes. A paravertebral stripe is one that is present  on the scale-row on either side of, but not including, the mid-dorsal  (vertebral) scale-row.    In order to reduce confusion in the discussion of variation, the  numbers designating the rows of dorsal scales are written as 1st, 2nd,  whereas the numbers designating the stripes are written as first,  second.    Except in three dried skeletons, teeth were counted on dentigerous  bones _in situ_. Since teeth are often missing, the sockets were  counted in order to obtain an accurate count.    In accounts of the species and subspecies, the observed range of  variation is followed by the mean in parentheses; in some instances  the mean is followed by the standard deviation, also in parentheses.  An example is 65-79 (70.6 +- 3.93).    Each synonymy includes all generic and specific combinations known to  me that have been used for the genus, and, in addition, references to  catalogues, checklists, and reports of collections.    Localities of occurrence that are not plotted on the distribution maps  are recorded in italic type under Specimens Examined. In the list of  Specimens Examined the localities and specimens are listed in the  following order: countries in alphabetical order; states or  departments in alphabetical order in each country; localities in  alphabetical order in each state or department; museum numbers in  numerical order after the abbreviations of names of museums. When more  than one specimen bears a single catalogue number, the number of  specimens is given in parentheses following the museum catalogue  number. Specimens for which data are given only as to country or to  state or department are listed first after the name of that political  unit under \"no specific locality.\"    The abbreviations for the museum collections are:      AMNH     American Museum of Natural History    ANSP     Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia    BMNH     British Museum (Natural History)    CAS      California Academy of Sciences    CNHM     Chicago Natural History Museum    ERA-WTN  E.
