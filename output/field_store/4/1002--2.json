NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING COMPANY, PUBLISHERS   1896          PREFACE.    It has become a universal custom to obtain and preserve the likenesses  of one's friends. Photographs are the most popular form of these  likenesses, as they give the true exterior outlines and appearance,  (except coloring) of the subjects. But how much more popular and useful  does photography become, when it can be used as a means of securing  plates from which to print photographs in a regular printing press, and,  what is more astonishing and delightful, to produce the REAL COLORS of  nature as shown in the subject, no matter how brilliant or varied.    We quote from the December number of the Ladies' Home Journal: \"_An  excellent_ suggestion was recently made by the Department of Agriculture  at Washington that the public schools of the country shall have a new  holiday, to be known as Bird Day. Three cities have already adopted the  suggestion, and it is likely that others will quickly follow. Of course,  Bird Day will differ from its successful predecessor, Arbor Day. We can  plant trees but not birds. It is suggested that Bird Day take the form  of bird exhibitions, of bird exercises, of bird studies--any form of  entertainment, in fact, which will bring children closer to their little  brethren of the air, and in more intelligent sympathy with their life  and ways. There is a wonderful story in bird life, and but few of our  children know it. Few of our elders do, for that matter. A whole day of  a year can well and profitably be given over to the birds. Than such  study, nothing can be more interesting. The cultivation of an intimate  acquaintanceship with our feathered friends is a source of genuine  pleasure. We are under greater obligations to the birds than we dream  of. Without them the world would be more barren than we imagine.  Consequently, we have some duties which we owe them. What these duties  are only a few of us know or have ever taken the trouble to find out.  Our children should not be allowed to grow to maturity without this  knowledge. The more they know of the birds the better men and women  they will be. We can hardly encourage such studies too much.\"    Of all animated nature, birds are the most beautiful in coloring, most  graceful in form and action, swiftest in motion and most perfect emblems  of freedom.    They are withal, very intelligent and have many remarkable traits,  so that their habits and characteristics make a delightful study  for all lovers of nature. In view of the facts, we feel that we are  doing a useful work for the young, and one that will be appreciated by  progressive parents, in placing within the easy possession of children  in the homes these beautiful photographs of birds.    The text is prepared with the view of giving the children as clear an  idea as possible, of haunts, habits, characteristics and such other  information as will lead them to love the birds and delight in their  study and acquaintance.

I am called the Nonpareil because there is no other bird equal to me.    I have many names. Some call me the \"Painted Finch\" or \"Painted  Bunting.\" Others call me \"The Pope,\" because I wear a purple hood.    I live in a cage, eat seeds, and am very fond of flies and spiders.    Sometimes they let me out of the cage and I fly about the room and catch  flies. I like to catch them while they are flying.    When I am tired I stop and sing. There is a vase of flowers in front of  the mirror.    I fly to this vase where I can see myself in the glass. Then I sing as  loud as I can. They like to hear me sing.    I take a bath every day and how I do make the water fly!    I used to live in the woods where there were many birds like me. We  built our nests in bushes, hedges, and low trees. How happy we were.    My cage is pretty but I wish I could go back to my home in the woods.    See page 15.        \"Sweet warblers of the sunny hours,         Forever on the wing,       I love thee as I love the flowers,         The sunlight and the spring.         They come like pleasant memories         In summer's joyous time,       And sing their gushing melodies,         As I would sing a rhyme.         In the green and quiet places,         Where the golden sunlight falls,       We sit with smiling faces         To list their silver calls.         And when their holy anthems         Come pealing through the air,       Our hearts leap forth to meet them         With a blessing and a prayer.         Amid the morning's fragrant dew,         Amid the mists of even,       They warble on as if they drew         Their music down from heaven.         How sweetly sounds each mellow note         Beneath the moon's pale ray,       When dying zephyrs rise and float         Like lovers' sighs away!\"          THE RESPLENDENT TROGON.    A Letter to Little Boys and Girls of the United States.      Is it cold where you live, little boys and girls? It is not where I  live. Don't you think my feathers grew in the bright sunshine?    My home is way down where the big oceans almost meet. The sun is almost  straight overhead every noon.    I live in the woods, way back where the trees are tall and thick. I  don't fly around much, but sit on a limb of a tree way up high.    Don't you think my red breast looks pretty among the green leaves?    When I see a fly or a berry I dart down after it. My long tail streams  out behind like four ribbons. I wish you could see me. My tail never  gets in the way.    Wouldn't you like to have me sit on your shoulder, little boy? You see  my tail would reach almost to the ground.    If you went out into the street with me on your shoulder, I would call  _whe-oo_, _whe-oo_, the way I do in the woods.    All the little boys and girls playing near would look around and say,  \"What is that noise?\" Then they would see you and me and run up fast and  say, \"Where did you get that bird?\"    The little girls would want to pull out my tail feathers to put around  their hats. You would not let them, would you?    I have a mate. I think she is very nice. Her tail is not so long as  mine. Would you like to see her too? She lays eggs every year, and sits  on them till little birds hatch out. They are just like us, but they  have to grow and get dressed in the pretty feathers like ours. They look  like little dumplings when they come out of the eggs.    But they are all right. They get very hungry and we carry them lots of  things to eat, so they can grow fast.        Your friend,                   R. T.    [Illustration: RESPLENDENT TROGON.]          THE RESPLENDENT TROGON.      Resplendent Trogons are natives of Central America. There are fifty  kinds, and this is the largest. A systematic account of the superb tribe  has been given by Mr. Gould, the only naturalist who has made himself  fully acquainted with them.    Of all birds there are few which excite so much admiration as the  Resplendent Trogon.    The skin is so singularly thin that it has been not inaptly compared to  wet blotting paper, and the plumage has so light a hold upon the skin  that when the bird is shot the feathers are plentifully struck from  their sockets by its fall and the blows which it receives from the  branches as it comes to the ground.    Its eggs, of a pale bluish-green, were first procured by Mr. Robert  Owen. Its chief home is in the mountains near Coban in Vera Paz, but it  also inhabits forests in other parts of Guatemala at an elevation of  from 6,000 to 9,000 feet.    From Mr. Salvin's account of his shooting in Vera Paz we extract the  following hunting story:    \"My companions are ahead and Filipe comes back to say that they have  heard a quesal (Resplendent Trogon). Of course, being anxious to watch  as well as to shoot one of these birds myself, I immediately hurry to  the spot. I have not to wait long. A distant clattering noise indicates  that the bird is on the wing. He settles--a splendid male--on the bough  of a tree not seventy yards from where we are hidden.

APPLETON AND COMPANY  MCMIV      COPYRIGHT, 1904, BY  D. APPLETON AND COMPANY    _Published, June, 1904_          PREFACE      Since the foundation of the Red Cross in America, many direful  calamities have afflicted the country. In each of these visitations the  Red Cross has acted in some degree as the Almoner--the distributer and  organizer--of the bountiful measures of relief that have been poured out  by the American people.    Its work has been accomplished quietly and without ostentation. All the  relief has been administered--not as charity--but as God-sent succor to  our brothers and sisters who have been overwhelmed by some mighty  convulsion of the forces of nature.    The wreckage has been cleared away, the stricken people have been  wisely, tenderly, and calmly guided out of panic and despair on to the  road of self-help and cooperative effort to restore their shattered  homes and broken fortunes; and then the Red Cross has retired as quietly  as it came, and few, outside of the people immediately concerned, have  realized the beneficent powers of help and healing that have fallen like  a benediction upon the stricken wherever that sacred symbol of humanity  has made its way.    It is my thought that a brief account of the work of the Red Cross  during the past twenty-five years will be of interest to the American  people. In a volume of this size it must of necessity be but a brief  outline, sufficient, however, to convey a clear impression of what the  Red Cross really means to every individual in this great country of  ours.    To the thousands of American men and women whose generous bounty has  made the work of the Red Cross possible, to the stricken and distressed  who because of it have been helped back to life and hope, and to all the  friends of the great, universal humanity which it typifies, this small  book is lovingly dedicated.

Please tell me about it; I can not  understand it.\"    There was a pleading earnestness in the tone not to be resisted, and  laying down my pen I commenced to explain to her the principles,  history, and uses of the Red Cross. She listened anxiously, the pretty  brow knitted; she seemed more and more perplexed, until, as if a light  had broken over her, she exclaimed, half impatiently:    \"Not that--not that, tell me something it _does_--it and you, I can  understand it better then.\"    A light had broken over me. It was a story the child wanted to  illustrate the principle and bring it home to her. A story she must  have.    In a half hour she felt that she knew it all and was an ardent devotee  even of its principles. But she had given me more than I had given her.  Here was food for thought.    For twenty-five years I had labored to explain the principles and uses  of the Red Cross; had written enough for a modest library of what it was  and what it meant, but, lest I seem egotistical, not a page of what it  did. The child had given me an idea that I would for once put into  practice, and write a few pages of what the Red Cross had done, leaving  principles to present themselves.    I will commence even back of itself.    Forty years ago, before most of you were born, a great war had been  fought in America, in which thousands died from battle and hardship, and  thousands more still left alive were worn out in the untried and  unsystematized efforts at relief that had been made through nearly five  years of continuous war. Of these latter, many were women who dragged  out weary lives in their own homes, some went to hospitals and retreats  for rest and care, and some were sent abroad. One of these latter I knew  personally, for, as Patrick would say, \"It was me-self.\"    To me it seemed a hard sentence that our physicians imposed. I had grown  to love the country we had so toiled for, and did not want to leave it.  Its very woes had made it dear to me. It had quiet once more, and a  peace that was not all a peace. It had its early soldier homes, its  fast-filling cemeteries, and the tender memory of a martyred President  resting over us like a pall. These had come to seem like a heritage to  me, and in my weakness I clung to them. Still, the order was obeyed and  I went.    Then followed travels in strange and foreign lands, other wars, illness  and suffering of my own, until eleven years later I came almost a  stranger again to our Government with another work, which I believed to  be for its good and the good of our people.    This time I brought the idea of the treaty of Geneva, asking our  Government, at the request of other Governments, to examine and to unite  with it, if found desirable. This effort with the Government covers five  years of hard, continuous labor, during which was sought the aid of  friends known in other years. At the end of this time, by advice of our  second martyred President and three members of his historic  cabinet--James G. Blaine, William Windom, and Robert T. Lincoln--a  national society was formed, known as the Association of the American  Red Cross, and, by desire and nomination of President Garfield, I was  made its president, and requested to name my officers.    The association was formed during the winter of 1880-'81, with the view  on the part of President Garfield of facilitating the adoption of the  treaty which he would name in his next message, which message was never  written.    Before the message, he, too, had joined the martyred ranks, and his  gentle successor, Arthur, filled his chair and kept his promise, and  through action of his own executive department the treaty was adopted;  indorsed by action of the Senate; proclaimed by the President to our  people; later ratified by the International Powers in the Congress of  Berne, with the pledge to render relief to unfortunate victims of war,  and the privilege, by my request, of rendering similar relief to the  victims of great national calamities or disasters.    All this had been accomplished by the kindly help of a few personal  friends, tireless and unrewarded, and while the news of the accession of  the Government of the United States, to the treaty of Geneva, lit  bonfires that night (for I cabled it by their request) in the streets of  Switzerland, France, Germany, and Spain, a little four-line paragraph in  the congressional doings of the day in the _Evening Star_, of  Washington, alone announced to the people of America that an  international treaty had been added to their rolls.    No personal distinction had been bestowed, no one honored, no one  politically advanced, no money of the Government expended, and, like  other things of like nature and history, it was left in obscurity to  make its own way and live its own hard life.    Thus the spring of 1882 found us--a few people, tired and weak, with  five years of costly service, a treaty gained, with no fund, no war nor  prospect of any, and no helpful connection with or acknowledgment by the  Government.    Soon the news of \"Half the State of Michigan on Fire\" called us to  action on our own laws of civil relief. A little draft on the purse of  the new, inexperienced president of the association paved the way for an  agent to go to the field. Others generously joined, all reported to our  friend and advocate, Senator Omar D. Conger, of Michigan. Some supplies  were sent, a society or two formed to provide and forward them. The  agents remained until the suffering was relieved, and thus the first  field relief work of which we have any record in the United States was  commenced.    Meanwhile, I had been asked by the Senate to write the history of the  Red Cross, and show the official action taken by our Government on the  acceptance of the treaty, which history the Senate would have printed at  the Government printing-office. This volume I prepared as requested. A  thousand copies were printed for information to the public, to be  circulated by the society; but with no frank or other means provided,  and with a postage of some ten cents a volume, we were compelled to  limit the circulation to the means.    The following year, 1883, a disastrous rise in the Ohio River called for  our aid. Dr. J. B. Hubbell, who had been our agent the year before, was  called from Michigan University,"]]]
