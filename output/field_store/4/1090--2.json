FITCH AND T. PAUL MASLIN      INTRODUCTION    The common garter snake (_Thamnophis sirtalis_) has by far the most  extensive geographic range of any North American reptile, covering  most of the continental United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific  and from south of the Mexican boundary far north into Canada and  southeastern Alaska. Of the several recognized subspecies, the eastern  _T. s. sirtalis_ has the most extensive range, but that of _T. s.  parietalis_ in the region between the Mississippi River and the  Rocky Mountains is almost as large. The more western _T. s. fitchi_  occurring from the Oregon and California coasts east through the  northern Great Basin, has the third largest range, while the far  western subspecies _pickeringi_, _concinnus_, _infernalis_ and  _tetrataenia_, and the Texan _T. s. annectens_ all have relatively  small ranges.    Since the publication of Ruthven's revision of the genus _Thamnophis_  more than 50 years ago, little attention has been devoted to the study  of this widespread and variable species, except in the Pacific Coast  states (Van Denburgh, 1918; Fitch, 1941; Fox, 1951). However, Brown  (1950) described the new subspecies _annectens_ in eastern Texas,  and many local studies have helped to clarify the distribution of the  species in the eastern part of the continent and to define the zone of  intergradation between the subspecies _sirtalis_ and _parietalis_. In  our study attention has been focused upon _parietalis_ in an  attempt to determine its western limits and its relationships to the  subspecies that replace it farther west.      TAXONOMIC HISTORY    _Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis_ Say was described (as _Coluber  parietalis_) in 1823 from a specimen obtained in what is now  Washington County, Nebraska, on the west side of the Missouri River  three miles upstream from the mouth of Boyer's River [Iowa], or  approximately eight miles north of Omaha. Although the type locality  was unequivocally stated in the original description, Nebraska was not  mentioned since the state was not yet in existence. Because the mouth  of Boyer's River, the landmark by means of which the type locality is  defined, is in Iowa, the impression has been imparted that the type  locality itself is in Iowa (Schmidt, 1953:175), and to our knowledge  the type locality has never been associated with Nebraska in the  literature.    Like all the more western subspecies, _parietalis_ is strikingly  different from typical _sirtalis_ in having conspicuous red markings.  The relationship between the two was early recognized. Several of  the other subspecies were originally described as distinct species.  _Coluber infernalis_ Blainville, 1835; _Tropidonotus concinnus_  Hallowell, 1852; _Eutainia pickeringi_ Baird and Girard, 1853; and  others now considered synonyms eventually came to be recognized  as conspecific with _Thamnophis sirtalis_. Ruthven (1908:166-173)  allocated all western _sirtalis_ to either _parietalis_ or  _concinnus_, the latter including the populations of the northwest  coast in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.    Subsequent more detailed studies by later workers with more abundant  material led to the recognition of some subspecies that Ruthven  thought invalid and led to the resurrection of some names that he  had placed in synonomy. Van Denburgh and Slevin (1918:198) recognized  _infernalis_ as the subspecies occurring over most of California and  southern Oregon, differing from more northern populations in having  more numerous ventrals and caudals and a paler ground color. Fitch  (1941:575) revived the name _pickeringii_ for a melanistic population  of western Washington and southwestern British Columbia, restricting  the name _concinnus_ to a red-headed and melanistic population of  northwestern Oregon, and restricting the name _infernalis_ to a  pale-colored population in the coastal strip of California.    These changes left most of the populations formerly included in  _concinnus_ and _infernalis_ without a name, and Fitch (_op. cit._)  revived _Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia_ (Cope) to apply to  them. However, Fox (1951:257) demonstrated that the type of _T. s.  tetrataenia_ came from the San Francisco peninsula (rather than  from \"Pit River, California\" as erroneously stated in the original  description) and that the name was applicable to a localized  peninsular population rather than to the wide-ranging far western  subspecies, which he named _T. s. fitchi_. The range of _fitchi_  includes California west of the Colorado and Mohave deserts  (except for the narrow strip of coast occupied by _infernalis_ and  _tetrataenia_), Oregon except the northwestern part, Washington east  of the Cascade Range, most of British Columbia, extreme southeastern  Alaska (occurring farther north than any other terrestrial reptile of  North America) and parts of Idaho.    Neither Fox (1951) nor Fitch (1941) defined the eastern limits of  _fitchi_ or discussed its relationship to the subspecies _parietalis_.  Wright and Wright (1957:849) stated: \"Fitch ... did not even mention  the big scrap basket form _parietalis_, from which he pulled _T. s.  fitchi_ (old _tetrataenia_). That comparison remains to be made, and  the east boundary of _fitchi_ and the west boundary of _parietalis_  are still nebulous.\" We have undertaken to define better than has been  done before the ranges of _parietalis_ and _fitchi_ and to list  the diagnostic characters separating these two subspecies. Freshly  collected material of both has been compared. At the time of his 1941  revision the senior author had never seen a live or recently preserved  specimen of _parietalis_.      DISCONTINUITY OF RANGE    Wherever it occurs at all, the common garter snake is usually  abundant. Because of its diurnal habits and the concentration of its  populations along watercourses, it is not likely to be overlooked.  There are few, if any, remaining large areas in the United States  where herpetologists have not carried on field work. It may be  anticipated that certain rare and secretive species will still be  found far from any known stations of occurrence, and seeming gaps in  the ranges of these species will eventually be filled. But for the  common garter snake the negative evidence provided by the lack of  records from extensive areas should be taken into account in mapping  the range.    Most large collections of garter snakes contain misidentified  specimens. The diagnostic differences in color and pattern are often  obscured, especially if the specimens are poorly preserved. Many  specimens deviate from the scalation typical of the form they  represent, and key out to other species. Isolated records should  therefore be accepted with caution. A case in point is Colorado  University Museum No. 46, from Buford, Rio Blanco County, Colorado,  originally identified by Cockerell (1910:131) as _Thamnophis sirtalis  parietalis_. This specimen, and another, now lost, from Meeker in the  same county seemingly served as the basis for mapping the range of  _sirtalis_ across the western half of Colorado, for there seem to  be no other records from this part of the state. However, a  re-examination of the specimen from Buford shows it to be an atypical  individual of another species, _T. elegans vagrans_. A specimen of  _T. radix haydeni_ (Col. U. Mus. No. 3165) was the basis for Maslin's  (1959:53) record of _parietalis_ in Baca County on the north fork  of the Cimarron River in southeastern Colorado. Brown (1950:203) has  mentioned the difficulty of defining the range of _sirtalis_ in the  southern Great Plains because of misidentifications of the similar _T.  radix_.    The range of the common garter snake has never been adequately mapped  in the Rocky Mountain and Great Basin states. Recent general works  (Smith, 1956:291; Wright and Wright 1957:834; Stebbins 1954:505;  Conant 1958:328) which have shown maps of the over-all range of  _sirtalis_, differ sharply as to the extent of its distribution  in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, but all show its distribution as  continuous over the more northern Great Basin and Rocky Mountain  states. However, specimens and specific locality records from  this extensive area seem to be scarce and some are based on early  collections of doubtful provenance. Throughout this region the low  rainfall, fluctuating and uncertain water supply, and general lack of  mesic vegetation along many of the streams render the habitat rather  hostile to garter snakes in general. _Thamnophis elegans vagrans_,  highly adapted to conditions in this region and generally distributed  over it, doubtless offers intensive competition to the species  _sirtalis_ wherever they overlap and perhaps constitutes a limiting  factor for _sirtalis_"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33967"],[0,"Descriptions of New Hylid Frogs From Mexico and Central America (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                  UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS      MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY      Volume 17, No. 13, pp. 559-578, 3 pls. 17-19      Date, April 5, 1968        Descriptions of New Hylid Frogs    From Mexico and Central America      BY      WILLIAM E.

DUELLMAN      Biological exploration of Mexico and Central America has revealed the  presence of a diverse fauna, elements of which have undergone speciation  in separate areas within the relatively small region. Some genera of  amphibians, especially _Eleutherodactylus_ and _Hyla_, are represented  by many species having small geographic ranges in Mexico and Central  America. Most of the species of _Hyla_ inhabiting the lowlands have been  known to science for many years, and most of the novelties today are  found in the less accessible highlands. No fewer than 19 new species of  hylid frogs have been discovered and named from Mexico and Central  America in the past decade.    In the spring and summer of 1966 I studied hylid frogs in many parts of  southern Mexico and Central America; the field work was designed to  obtain specimens and data that would resolve certain systematic  problems. To a certain extent the studies were successful, but in the  course of the work five previously unknown hylids were discovered; these  are named and described in this paper. The only species described herein  that I do not know in life is one of _Plectrohyla_ that has been  represented in museum collections for several years but was not obtained  in my own field work.    In this paper I am presenting diagnoses, descriptions, and brief  comments on the relationships of five new species and one subspecies.  More exhaustive accounts will be included in a monograph, now in  preparation, on the Middle American hylids.    For use of comparative material used in the preparation of this paper, I  am indebted to Richard J. Baldauf, Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collection  (TCWC); Charles M. Bogert, American Museum of Natural History (AMNH);  James A. Peters, United States National Museum (USNM); Hobart M. Smith,  University of Illinois Museum of Natural History (UIMNH); Charles F.  Walker, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ); and Ernest E.  Williams, Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ). KU refers to the  University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. I am especially grateful  for help in obtaining specimens and data to Linda Trueb, who accompanied  me throughout Mexico and Central America, where we were joined by John  D. Lynch in Costa Rica and Charles W. Myers in Panama. Linda Trueb  offered helpful suggestions in the course of preparing the manuscript,  and David M. Dennis skillfully prepared the illustrations which more  accurately depict the frogs than my written descriptions; both of these  persons have my thanks for their contributions.    Ratibor Hartmann of Finca Santa Clara, Chiriqui, Panama, made possible  our travels to the Rio Changena on the Atlantic slopes of Bocas del  Toro. Field work in Costa Rica was facilitated by the Organization of  Tropical Studies through the courtesy of Stephen B. Preston and Norman  Scott. Rodolfo Hernandez Corzo of the Direccion General de la Fauna  Silvestre provided the necessary permits to collect in Mexico. I thank  each of these persons for his helpfulness and cooperation.    Field work in Mexico and Central America and the associated laboratory  studies on Middle American hylid frogs are supported by grants from the  National Science Foundation (GB-1441 and GB-5818). The field work in  Panama was part of a survey of the herpetofauna of that country carried  out in cooperation with the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory and supported by  the National Institutes of Health (GM-12020).
