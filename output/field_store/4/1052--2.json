The value of this little book, as the reader will soon discover, depends  less upon my own work than upon the large number of choirmasters whose  experience I have been fortunate enough, directly or indirectly, to lay  under contribution. The conditions of the choir-trainer's work vary, in  an endless way, according to his surroundings and opportunities. And it  is just when work becomes difficult that contrivances and hints are most  fruitfully evolved. Hence I have given in great detail the experiences  of many correspondents, and some of the most useful suggestions for  ordinary church choir work will be found to proceed from writers holding  no great appointment, but seeking quietly and unostentatiously to  produce good results from poor material.    In view of a second edition, I shall be pleased to receive letters from  readers who have further experiences to offer.    J. S. C.    _June_, 1891.          CONTENTS.

THE HEALTHFULNESS OF SINGING.      The boy's voice, though an immature organ of delicate structure, is  capable of much work, providing only that its mechanism be rightly used  and not forced. Some people are unnecessarily nervous about boys; as a  rule, under competent guidance, they will get nothing but good from  vocal work. A cathedral organist wrote to me the other day:--    \"Our best solo boy, who has a splendid voice and who sings beautifully,  has been unwell, and the Dean and Chapter doctor (who has an idea that  every choir-boy should be as robust as a plough-boy) has just stated  that the boy is too feeble to remain in the choir. Notwithstanding my  remonstrances, the Dean and Chapter decided yesterday to uphold the  doctor. I tried his voice last week, and he sang with full, rich tone up  to the C above the stave, and that after he had been skating from 9 a.m.  to 5 p.m. I should have thought that a boy who could skate all day could  not be in such a 'feeble' state as represented by the medical man. Three  months ago a boy with a beautiful voice was sent away for the same  reason. So you see what uphill work it is for me.\"    It is to be hoped that fastidiousness of this sort is not common. The  _abuse_ of the voice may lead, of course, to serious results. In the  _New York Medical Record_ of March 21, 1885, p. 317, there is a case  recorded of the bursting of a blood vessel through too energetic  singing, but this is altogether abnormal, and beyond the scope of our  enquiry. The voice, properly used, will last as long as any other organ,  and it benefits by exercise. Mr. D. W. Rootham of Bristol, who now at  middle age has a strong constitution and a fine baritone voice, tells me  that as a boy at Cambridge he sang for seven years at five services  every Sunday. The thing seems incredible, and it is an extreme case,  though it shows what work the voice, properly managed, will do.    Singing, it should be remembered, promotes health. It does so indirectly  by causing cheerfulness, a genial flow of spirits, and the soothing of  the nerves. It does so directly by increasing the action of the lungs.  So far as these organs are concerned, singing is a more energetic form  of speech. As we sing we breathe deeply, bring more air into contact  with the lungs, and thus vitalise and purify the blood, giving stimulus  to the faculties of digestion and nutrition. A physiologist, in fact,  can trace the effects of singing from the lungs into the blood, from the  blood into the processes of nutrition, back again into the blood, into  the nerves, and finally into the brain, which of all organs is most  dependent upon healthful and well-oxygenated blood. Dr. Martin (organist  of St. Paul's Cathedral) has had many years' experience in training  choir-boys, and he tells me that he has never known a boy to injure his  voice, or lose it through singing. It is a question of method; if the  voice be used properly it will stand any amount of work. He has seen  boys disposed to consumption improve in health after joining the choir.  The medical man who declared that if there were more singing there would  be less coughing, expressed in a graphic way the healthful influence of  vocal practice. Parents and guardians need never hesitate to allow their  sons and charges to become choir-boys under proper choirmasters. They  may be sure that nothing but good can come of the exercise.    Two cautions only are needed. The first is, not to sing during a cold.  When a slight inflammation has attacked the larynx--that is, when a cold  has been taken--the vocal cords are thickened, and the act of  vocalisation causes them to rub together, which increases the  inflammation. If the cold is a bad one--that is, if the inflammation is  great--the singer will be compelled to rest, because the congestive  swelling of the vocal cords will be so great that they will be unable to  vibrate sufficiently to produce tone. But whether slight or great, the  cold demands rest. Otherwise permanent injury may be done to the voice.    The second caution relates to the preservation, not of the boy's voice,  but of the man's. There is no doubt that it is undesirable for a boy to  continue to sing after his voice has shown signs of \"breaking.\" What are  the first signs of this change? Choirmasters notice that the middle  register becomes weak, without any diminution in the power and quality  of the upper notes, but that at the same time the thick register grows  stronger, and the boy can strike middle C with firmness. \"The striking  of middle C,\" says Mr. G. Bernard Gilbert, \"is usually sufficient to  decide the point.\" The tradition of teachers is in favour of rest at  this time, and a well-founded public impression counts for a good deal.  The fact is that during the time of change not only do the vocal cords  lengthen, but they are congested. An inflammatory action, like that  which takes place during a cold, is set up. Hence rest is desirable.  Nature herself also counsels rest because she reduces the musical value  of the voice at this time to a low ebb. It becomes husky and of  uncertain intonation. No doubt cases can be quoted of boys who have sung  on uninterruptedly and developed into good tenors or basses, but there  are cases equally strong in which the man's voice has completely failed  after such a course. Sir Morell Mackenzie is the only medical writer who  has advocated singing during change of voice, but not even his authority  can upset the weight of evidence on the other side.    Nevertheless, on the principle of \"hear both sides\" I quote the  following from a letter by Mr. E. H. Saxton, choirmaster of St. James's  church, at Buxton:--    \"Upon the question of resting completely from singing during the period  of change of voice, I hold that one must be guided by the circumstances  of each individual case. I carefully watch each boy when I am expecting  the change to commence, and it usually shows itself by the upper thin  register giving way. If I cannot immediately spare the boy from the  treble part (and good leading boys are not plentiful), I caution him to  leave high notes alone, never to force them, and as soon as possible I  relegate him to the alto part, where he often remains useful to me for a  year or eighteen months. All the time he is singing the alto part I keep  watch over him, and forbid his singing as soon as there are indications  that the effort is in the slightest degree painful. Generally I find  this prohibition to be only necessary for notes above [Illustration:  middle f] Should a vacancy occur in the senior choir (if the boy shows  signs of his voice developing to either tenor or bass) I get him passed  from the junior to the senior choir, warning him, however, to be very  careful of his high notes, and never to force them. My general  experience leads me to the conclusion that it is a most arbitrary and  unnecessary rule to lay down that every boy should rest at this time. In  some cases it is necessary, no doubt, but my opinion is, after twenty  years' practical experience, that in a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32032"],[0,"Second Variety (#1)"],[1,"etext was produced from Space Science Fiction May 1953.

DICK      ILLUSTRATED BY EBEL        The claws were bad enough in the first place--nasty, crawling      little death-robots. But when they began to imitate their      creators, it was time for the human race to make peace--if it      could!      The Russian soldier made his way nervously up the ragged side of the  hill, holding his gun ready. He glanced around him, licking his dry  lips, his face set. From time to time he reached up a gloved hand and  wiped perspiration from his neck, pushing down his coat collar.    Eric turned to Corporal Leone. \"Want him? Or can I have him?\" He  adjusted the view sight so the Russian's features squarely filled the  glass, the lines cutting across his hard, somber features.    Leone considered. The Russian was close, moving rapidly, almost  running. \"Don't fire. Wait.\" Leone tensed. \"I don't think we're  needed.\"    The Russian increased his pace, kicking ash and piles of debris out of  his way. He reached the top of the hill and stopped, panting, staring  around him. The sky was overcast, drifting clouds of gray particles.  Bare trunks of trees jutted up occasionally; the ground was level and  bare, rubble-strewn, with the ruins of buildings standing out here and  there like yellowing skulls.    The Russian was uneasy. He knew something was wrong. He started down  the hill. Now he was only a few paces from the bunker. Eric was  getting fidgety. He played with his pistol, glancing at Leone.    \"Don't worry,\" Leone said. \"He won't get here. They'll take care of  him.\"    \"Are you sure? He's got damn far.\"    \"They hang around close to the bunker. He's getting into the bad part.  Get set!\"    The Russian began to hurry, sliding down the hill, his boots sinking  into the heaps of gray ash, trying to keep his gun up. He stopped for  a moment, lifting his fieldglasses to his face.    \"He's looking right at us,\" Eric said.           *       *       *       *       *    The Russian came on. They could see his eyes, like two blue stones.  His mouth was open a little. He needed a shave; his chin was stubbled.  On one bony cheek was a square of tape, showing blue at the edge. A  fungoid spot. His coat was muddy and torn. One glove was missing. As  he ran his belt counter bounced up and down against him.    Leone touched Eric's arm. \"Here one comes.\"    Across the ground something small and metallic came, flashing in the  dull sunlight of mid-day. A metal sphere. It raced up the hill after  the Russian, its treads flying. It was small, one of the baby ones.  Its claws were out, two razor projections spinning in a blur of white  steel. The Russian heard it. He turned instantly, firing. The sphere  dissolved into particles. But already a second had emerged and was  following the first. The Russian fired again.    A third sphere leaped up the Russian's leg, clicking and whirring. It  jumped to the shoulder. The spinning blades disappeared into the  Russian's throat.    Eric relaxed. \"Well, that's that. God, those damn things give me the  creeps. Sometimes I think we were better off before.\"    \"If we hadn't invented them, they would have.\" Leone lit a cigarette  shakily. \"I wonder why a Russian would come all this way alone. I  didn't see anyone covering him.\"    Lt. Scott came slipping up the tunnel, into the bunker. \"What  happened? Something entered the screen.\"    \"An Ivan.\"    \"Just one?\"    Eric brought the view screen around. Scott peered into it. Now there  were numerous metal spheres crawling over the prostrate body, dull  metal globes clicking and whirring, sawing up the Russian into small  parts to be carried away.    \"What a lot of claws,\" Scott murmured.    \"They come like flies. Not much game for them any more.\"    Scott pushed the sight away, disgusted. \"Like flies. I wonder why he  was out there. They know we have claws all around.\"    A larger robot had joined the smaller spheres. It was directing  operations, a long blunt tube with projecting eyepieces. There was not  much left of the soldier. What remained was being brought down the  hillside by the host of claws.    \"Sir,\" Leone said. \"If it's all right, I'd like to go out there and  take a look at him.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Maybe he came with something.\"    Scott considered. He shrugged. \"All right. But be careful.\"    \"I have my tab.\" Leone patted the metal band at his wrist. \"I'll be  out of bounds.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He picked up his rifle and stepped carefully up to the mouth of the  bunker, making his way between blocks of concrete and steel prongs,  twisted and bent. The air was cold at the top. He crossed over the  ground toward the remains of the soldier, striding across the soft  ash. A wind blew around him, swirling gray particles up in his face.  He squinted and pushed on.    The claws retreated as he came close, some of them stiffening into  immobility. He touched his tab. The Ivan would have given something  for that! Short hard radiation emitted from the tab neutralized the  claws, put them out of commission. Even the big robot with its two  waving eyestalks retreated respectfully as he approached.    He bent down over the remains of the soldier. The gloved hand was  closed tightly. There was something in it. Leone pried the fingers  apart. A sealed container, aluminum. Still shiny.    He put it in his pocket and made his way back to the bunker. Behind  him the claws came back to life, moving into operation again. The  procession resumed, metal spheres moving through the gray ash with  their loads. He could hear their treads scrabbling against the ground.  He shuddered.    Scott watched intently as he brought the shiny tube out of his pocket.  \"He had that?\"    \"In his hand.\" Leone unscrewed the top. \"Maybe you should look at it,  sir.\"    Scott took it. He emptied the contents out in the palm of his hand. A  small piece of silk paper, carefully folded. He sat down by the light  and unfolded it.    \"What's it say, sir?\" Eric said. Several officers came up the tunnel.  Major Hendricks appeared.    \"Major,\" Scott said. \"Look at this.\"    Hendricks read the slip. \"This just come?\"    \"A single runner. Just now.\"    \"Where is he?\" Hendricks asked sharply.    \"The claws got him.\"    Major Hendricks grunted. \"Here.\" He passed it to his companions. \"I  think this is what we've been waiting for. They certainly took their  time about it.\"    \"So they want to talk terms,\" Scott said. \"Are we going along with  them?\"    \"That's not for us to decide.\" Hendricks sat down. \"Where's the  communications officer? I want the Moon Base.\"    Leone pondered as the communications officer raised the outside  antenna cautiously, scanning the sky above the bunker for any sign of  a watching Russian ship.    \"Sir,\" Scott said to Hendricks. \"It's sure strange they suddenly came  around. We've been using the claws for almost a year. Now all of a  sudden they start to fold.\"    \"Maybe claws have been getting down in their bunkers.\"    \"One of the big ones, the kind with stalks, got into an Ivan bunker  last week,\" Eric said. \"It got a whole platoon of them before they got  their lid shut.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"A buddy told me. The thing came back with--with remains.\"    \"Moon Base, sir,\" the communications officer said.    On the screen the face of the lunar monitor appeared. His crisp  uniform contrasted to the uniforms in the bunker. And he was clean  shaven. \"Moon Base.\"    \"This is forward command L-Whistle. On Terra. Let me have General  Thompson.\"    The monitor faded. Presently General Thompson's heavy features came  into focus. \"What is it, Major?\"    \"Our claws got a single Russian runner with a message. We don't know  whether to act on it--there have been tricks like this in the past.\"    \"What's the message?\"    \"The Russians want us to send a single officer on policy level over to  their lines. For a conference. They don't state the nature of the  conference. They say that matters of--\" He consulted the slip.  \"--Matters of grave urgency make it advisable that discussion be  opened between a representative of the UN forces and themselves.\"    He held the message up to the screen for the general to scan.  Thompson's eyes moved.    \"What should we do?\" Hendricks said.    \"Send a man out.\"    \"You don't think it's a trap?\"    \"It might be. But the location they give for their forward command is  correct. It's worth a try, at any rate.\"    \"I'll send an officer out. And report the results to you as soon as he  returns.\"    \"All right, Major.\" Thompson broke the connection. The screen died. Up  above, the antenna came slowly down.    Hendricks rolled up the paper, deep in thought.    \"I'll go,\" Leone said.    \"They want somebody at policy level.\" Hendricks rubbed his jaw.  \"Policy level. I haven't been outside in months. Maybe I could use a  little air.\"    \"Don't you think it's risky?\"    Hendricks lifted the view sight and gazed into it. The remains of the  Russian were gone. Only a single claw was in sight. It was folding  itself back, disappearing into the ash, like a crab. Like some hideous  metal crab....    \"That's the only thing that bothers me.\" Hendricks rubbed his wrist.  \"I know I'm safe as long as I have this on me. But there's something  about them. I hate the damn things. I wish we'd never invented them.  There's something wrong with them. Relentless little--\"    \"If we hadn't invented them, the Ivans would have.\"    Hendricks pushed the sight back. \"Anyhow, it seems to be winning the  war. I guess that's good.\"    \"Sounds like you're getting the same jitters as the Ivans.\" Hendricks  examined his wrist watch. \"I guess I had better get started, if I want  to be there before dark.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He took a deep"]]]
