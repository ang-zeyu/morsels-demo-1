With an Introduction by      JAMES MILLINGTON.      ***      New York: D. Appleton & Co., 1, 3, & 5 Bond Street.      1884.      * Introduction *      **    _FROM_ the time of Shakspere downwards, wits and authors innumerable  have made themselves and the public more or less merry at the expense  of the earlier efforts of the student of a strange tongue; but it has  been reserved to our own time for a _soi disant_ instructor to  perpetrate--at his own expense--the monstrous joke of publishing a  Guide to Conversation in a language of which it is only too evident  that every word is utterly strange to him. The Teutonic sage who  evolved the ideal portrait of an elephant from his \"inner  consciousness\" was a commonplace, matter-of fact person compared with  the daring visionary who conjures up a complete system of language  from the same fertile but untrustworthy source. The piquancy of  Senhor Pedro Carolino's _New Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese  and English_ is enhanced by the evident _bona fides_ and careful  compilation of \"the little book,\" or as Pedro himself gravely  expresses it, \"for the care what we wrote him, and for her  typographical correction.\"    In short, the _New Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese and  English_ was written with serious intent, and for the purpose of  initiating Portuguese students into the mysteries of the English  language. The earlier portions of the book are divided into three  columns, the first giving the Portuguese; the second what, in the  opinion of the author, is the English equivalent; and the third the  English equivalent phonetically spelt, so that the tyro may at the  same time master our barbarous phraseology and the pronunciation  thereof. In the second part of the work the learner is supposed to  have sufficiently mastered the pronunciation of the English language,  to be left to his own devices.    A little consideration of the shaping of our author's English phrases  leads to the conclusion that the materials used have been a  Portuguese-French phrase-book and a French-English dictionary. With  these slight impedimenta has the daring Lusitanian ventured upon the  unknown deep of a strange language, and the result, to quote again  from the Preface, \"May be worth the acceptation of the studious  persons, and especially of the Youth, at which we dedicate him  particularly,\" but will at all events contribute not a little to the  Youth's hilarity.    To begin with the vocabulary; it is perhaps hardly fair to expect a  professor of languages to trouble himself with \"Degrees of Kindred,\"  still, such titles as \"Gossip mistress, a relation, an relation, a  guardian, an guardian, the quatergrandfather, the quater-grandmother,\"  require some slight elucidation, and passing over the catalogue of  articles of dress which are denominated \"Objects of Man\" and \"Woman  Objects,\" one may take exception to \"crumbs\" and \"groceries,\" which  are inserted among plates and cruets as ordinary table garniture.    Among what are denominated \"Eatings\" we find \"some wigs,\" \"a dainty  dishes,\" \"a mutton shoulder,\" \"a little mine,\" \"hog-fat,\" and \"an  amelet\": the _menu_ is scarcely appetising, especially when among  \"Fishes and Shellfishes\" our Portuguese Lucullus sets down the  \"hedgehog,\" \"snail,\" and \"wolf.\" After this such trifles as \"starch\"  arranged under the heading of \"Metals and Minerals,\" and \"brick\" and  \"whitelead\" under that of \"Common Stones\" fall almost flat; but one  would like to be initiated into the mysteries of \"gleek,\" \"carousal,\"  and \"keel,\" which are gravely asserted to be \"Games.\" Among \"Chivalry  Orders\" one has a glimmering of what is intended by \"Saint  Michaelmas\" and \"Very-Merit\"; but under the heading of \"Degrees,\"  although by a slight exercise of the imagination we can picture to  ourselves \"a quater master,\" \"a general to galeries,\" or even a  \"vessel captain,\" we are entirely nonplussed by \"a harbinger\" and \"a  parapet.\"    Passing on to \"Familiar Phrases,\" most of which appear to be old  friends with new faces, Senhor Carolino's literal cribs from the  French become more and more apparent, in spite of his boast in the  Preface of being \"clean of gallicisms and despoiled phrases.\" \"Apply  you at the study during that you are young\" is doubtless an excellent  precept, and as he remarks further on \"How do you can it to deny\";  but study may be misdirected, and in the moral, no less than in the  material world, it is useful to know. \"That are the dishes whom you  must be and to abstain\"; while the meaning of \"This girl have a  beauty edge\" is scarcely clear unless it relates to the preternatural  acuteness of the fair sex in these days of board schools and woman's  rights.    Further on the conversationalist appears to get into rough company,  and we find him remarking \"He laughs at my nose, he jest by me,\"  gallice \"_Il me rit au nez, il se moque de moi_\"; \"He has me take out  my hairs,\" \"He does me some kicks,\" \"He has scratch the face with  hers nails,\" all doubtless painfully translated with the assistance  of a French-English dictionary from \"_Il m'a arrache les cheveux_,\"  \"_Il me donne des coups-de-pied_,\" \"_Il m'a lacere la figure de ses  ongles_.\" It is noticeable that our instructor as a rule endeavours  to make the possessive pronoun agree with the substantive in number  and gender in orthodox Portuguese fashion, and that like a true  grammatical patriot he insists upon the substantive having the same  gender as in his native tongue; therefore \"_as unhas_\" must be  rendered \"hers nails\" and \"_vossas civilidades_\" \"yours civilities.\"  By this time no one will be disposed to contradict our inimitable  Pedro when he remarks \"_E facteo_\" giving the translation as \"He has  the word for to laugh,\" a construction bearing a suspicious  resemblance to \"_Il a le mot pour rire._\" \"He do the devil at four\"  has no reference to an artful scheme for circumventing the Archfiend  at a stated hour, but is merely a simulacrum of the well-known gallic  idiomatic expression \"_Il fait le diable a quatre._\" Truly this is  excellent fooling; _Punch_ in his wildest humour, backed by the whole  colony of Leicester Square, could not produce funnier English.  \"He burns one's self the brains,\" \"He was fighted in duel,\" \"They  fight one's selfs together,\" \"He do want to fall,\" would be more  intelligible if less picturesque in their original form of \"_Il se  brule la cervelle_,\" \"_Il s'cet battu en duel_,\" \"_lis se battent  ensemble_,\" \"_Il manque de tomber_.\" The comic vein running through  the \"Familiar Phrases\" is so inexhaustible that space forbids further  quotation from this portion of the book, which may be appropriately  closed with \"Help to a little most the better yours terms,\" a  mysterious adjuration, which a reference to the original Portuguese  leads one to suppose may be a daring guess at \"_Choisissez un pen  mieux vos paroles_.\"    In the second part, entitled \"Familiar Dialogues,\" the fun grows fast  and furious. Let us accompany our mad wag upon \"The walk.\" \"You hear  the bird's gurgling?\" he enquires, and then rapturously exclaims  \"Which pleasure! which charm! The field has by me a thousand  charms\"; after this, to the question \"Are you hunter? Will you go to  the hunting in one day this week?\" he responds \"Willingly; I have not  a most pleasure in the world. There is some game on they cantons.\"  Proceeding from \"game\" to \"gaming\" we soon run aground upon the word  \"_jeu_,\" which as we know does duty in French both for a game and a  pack of cards. \"At what pack will you that we does play?\" \"To the  cards.\" Of course this is \"_A quel Jeu voulez vous que nous  Jouions?_\" \"_Aux cartes_;\" and further on \"This time I have a great  deal pack,\" \"_Cette fois j'ai un jeu excellent!_\"    Now let us listen to our friend at his tailor's: his greeting is  perky--almost slangy. \"Can you do me a coat?\" he enquires, but  quickly drivels down to \"What cloth will you do to?\" and then to the  question \"What will you to double (_doubler_) the coat?\" obtains the  satisfactory answer \"From something of duration. I believe to you  that.\" After requesting to have his garment \"The rather that be  possible,\" he overwhelms the procrastinating man of cloth with the  stern remark \"You have me done to expect too,\" evidently a bold  version of \"_Vous m' avez fait trop attendre_,\" which draws forth the  natural excuse \"I did can't to come rather.\" Passing by a number of  good things which one would like to analyse if space permitted, we  arrive at \"For to ride a horse,\" a fine little bit of word painting  almost Carlylean in its grotesqueness. \"Here is a horse who have a   bad looks. He not sail know to march, he is pursy, he is foundered.  Don't you are ashamed to give me a jade as like? he is unshoed, he is  with nails up; it want to lead to the farrier.\" \"Let us prick  (_piquons_) go us more fast, never I was seen a so much bad beast;  she will not nor to bring forward neither put back.\" \"Strek him the  bridle,\" cries the horsedealer, \"Hold him the rein sharters.\" \"Pique  stron gly, make to marsh him.\" \"I have pricked him enough. But  I can't to make marsh him,\" replies the indignant client. \"Go down, I  shall make marsh,\" declares the dealer; upon which the incensed  equestrian rejoins \"Take care that he not give you a foot kicks,\" and  the \"coper\" sardonically but somewhat incoherently concludes with  \"Then he kicks for that I look?

Therefore a delusion can be a fine thing for prodding        angry belligerents...._           *       *       *       *       *          I remember some bad times, most of them back home on Excenus 23; the  worst was when Dad fell under the reaping machine but there was also  the one when I got lost twenty miles from home with a dud radio, at  the age of twelve; and the one when Uncle Charlie caught me practicing  emergency turns in a helicar round the main weather-maker; and the one  on Figuerra being chased by a cyber-crane; and the time when Dad  decided to send me to Earth to do my Education.    This time is bad in a different way, with no sharp edges but a kind of  a desolation.    Most people I know are feeling bad just now, because at Russett  College we finished our Final Examination five days ago and Results  are not due for a two weeks.    My friend B Laydon says this is yet another Test anyone still sane at  the end being proved tough enough to break a molar on; she says also  The worst part is in bed remembering all the things she could have  written and did not; The second worst is also in bed picturing how to  explain to her parents when they get back to Earth that _someone_ has  to come bottom and in a group as brilliant as Russett College Cultural  Engineering Class this is really no disgrace.    I am not worried that way so much, I cannot remember what I wrote  anyway and I can think of one or two people I am pretty sure will come  bottomer than me--or B either.    I would prefer to think it is just Finals cause me to feel miserable  but it is not.    In Psychology they taught us The mind has the faculty of concealing  any motive it is ashamed of, especially from itself; seems  unfortunately mine does not have this gadget supplied.    I never wanted to come to Earth. I was sent to Russett against my will  and counting the days till I could get back to Home, Father and  Excensus 23, but the sad truth is that now the longed-for moment is  nearly on top of me I do not want to go.    Dad's farm was a fine place to grow up, but now I had four years on  Earth the thought of going back there makes me feel like a  three-weeks' chicken got to get back in its shell.    B and I are on an island in the Pacific. Her parents are on Caratacus  researching on local art forms, so she and I came here to be miserable  in company and away from the rest.    It took me years on Earth to get used to all this water around, it  seemed unnatural and dangerous to have it all lying loose that way,  but now I shall miss even the Sea.    The reason we have this long suspense over Finals is that they will  not use Reading Machines to mark the papers for fear of cutting down  critical judgement; so each paper has to be read word by word by three  Examiners and there are forty-three of us and we wrote six papers  each.    What I think is I am sorry for the Examiners, but B says they were the  ones who set the papers and it serves them perfectly right.    I express surprise because D. J. M'Clare our Professor is one of them,  but B says He is one of the greatest men in the galaxy, of course, but  she gave up thinking him perfect _years_ ago.    One of the main attractions on this Island is swimming under water,  especially by moonlight. Dad sent me a fish-boat as a birthday present  two years back, but I never used it yet on account of my  above-mentioned attitude to water. Now I got this feeling of Carpe  Diem, make the most of Earth while I am on it because probably I shall  not pass this way again.    The fourth day on the Island it is full moon at ten o'clock, so I  pluck up courage to wriggle into the boat and go out under the Sea. B  says Fish parading in and out of reefs just remind her of Cultural  Engineering--crowd behavior--so she prefers to turn in early and find  out what nightmares her subconscious will throw up _this_ time.    The reefs by moonlight are everything they are supposed to be, why did  I not do this often when I had the chance? I stay till my oxygen is  nearly gone, then come out and sadly press the button that collapses  the boat into a thirty-pound package of plastic hoops and oxygen cans.  I sling it on my back and head for the chalet B and I hired among the  coconut trees.           *       *       *       *       *    I am crossing an open space maybe fifty yards from it when a Thing  drops on me out of the air.    I do not see the Thing because part of it covers my face, and the rest  is grabbed round my arms and my waist and my hips and whatever, I  cannot see and I cannot scream and I cannot find anything to kick. The  Thing is strong and rubbery and many-armed and warmish, and less than  a second after I first feel it I am being hauled up into the air.    I do not care for this at all.    I am at least fifty feet up before it occurs to me to bite the hand  that gags me and then I discover it is plastic, not alive at all. Then  I feel self and encumberance scraping through some kind of aperture;  there is a sharp click as of a door closing and the Thing goes limp  all round me.    I spit out the bit I am biting and it drops away so that I can see.    Well!    I am in a kind of a cup-shaped space maybe ten feet across but not  higher than I am; there is a trap door in the ceiling; the Thing is  lying all around me in a mess of plastic arms, with an extensible  stalk connecting it to the wall. I kick free and it turns over  exposing the label FRAGILE CARGO right across the back.    The next thing I notice is two holdalls, B's and mine, clamped against  the wall, and the next after that is the opening of a trap door in the  ceiling and B's head silhouetted in it remarking Oh there you are Liz.    I confirm this statement and ask for explanations.    B says She doesn't understand all of it but it is all right.    It is not all right I reply, if she has joined some Society such as  for the Realization of Fictitious Improbabilities that is her  privilege but no reason to involve me.    B says Why do I not stop talking and come up and see for myself?    There is a slight hitch when I jam in the trap door, then B helps me  get the boat off my back and I drop it on the Fragile Cargo and emerge  into the cabin of a Hopper, drop-shaped, cargo-carrying; I have been  in its hold till now.    There are one or two peculiar points about it, or maybe one or two  hundred, such as the rate at which we are ascending which seems to be  bringing us right into the Stratosphere; but the main thing I notice  is the pilot. He has his back to us but is recognizably Ram Gopal who  graduated in Cultural Engineering last year, Rumor says next to top of  his class.    I ask him what kind of a melodramatic shenanigan is this?    B says We had to leave quietly in a hurry without attracting attention  so she booked us out at the Hotel _hours_ ago and she and Ram have  been hanging around waiting for me ever since.    I point out that the scope-trace of an Unidentified Flying Object will  occasion a lot more remark than a normal departure even at midnight.    At this Ram smiles in an inscrutable Oriental manner and B gets nearly  as cross as I do, seems she has mentioned this point before.    We have not gone into it properly when the cabin suddenly shifts  through a right angle. B and I go sliding down the vertical floor and  end sitting on a window. There is a jolt and a shudder and Ram mutters  things in Hindi and then suddenly Up is nowhere at all.    B and I scramble off the window and grab fixtures so as to stay put.  The stars have gone and we can see nothing except the dim glow over  the instruments; then suddenly lights go on outside.    We look out into the hold of a ship.    Our ten-foot teardrop is sitting next to another one, like two eggs  in a rack. On the other side is a bulkhead; behind, the curve of the  hull; and directly ahead an empty space, then another bulkhead and an  open door, through which after a few seconds a head pokes cautiously.    The head is then followed by a body which kicks off against the wall  and sails slowly towards us. Ram presses a stud and a door slides open  in the hopper; but the new arrival stops himself with a hand on either  side of the frame, his legs trailing any old how behind him. It is  Peter Yeng Sen who graduated the year I did my Field Work.    He says, Gopal, dear fellow, there was no need for the knocking, we  heard the bell all right.    Ram grumbles something about the guide beam being miss-set, and slides  out of his chair. Peter announces that we have only just made it as  the deadline is in seven minutes time; he waves B and me out of the  hopper, through the door and into a corridor where a certain irregular  vibration is coming from the walls.    Ram asks what is that tapping? And Peter sighs and says The present  generation of students has no discipline at all.    At this B brakes with one hand against the wall and cocks her head to  listen; next moment she laughs and starts banging with her fist on the  wall.    Peter exclaims in Mandarin and tows her away by one wrist like a  reluctant kite. The rapping starts again on the far side of the wall  and I suddenly recognize a primitive signaling system called Regret  or something, I guess because it was used by people in situations they  did not like such as Sinking ships or solitary confinement; it is done  by tapping water pipes and such.    Someone found it in a book and the more childish element in College  "]]]
