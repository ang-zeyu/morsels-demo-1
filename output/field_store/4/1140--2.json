Bologna, 1651.)]      EXPLANATION    \"Astrea, goddess of the heaven, wearing angel's wings and gleaming  everywhere with stars, stands at the right; on the left is Argus of  the hundred eyes, not tense, but indicating by the position of the  telescope at his knee rather than at the eyes in his head, that while  observing the work of God's hand, he appears at the same time to be  worshipping as in genuflexion.\" (Riccioli: _Alm. Nov._, _Praefatio_,  xvii). He points to the cherubs in the heavens who hold the planets,  each with its zodiacal sign: above him at the top is Mars, then  Mercury in its crescent form, the Sun, and Venus also in the crescent  phase; on the opposite side are Saturn in its \"tripartite\" form (the  ring explanation was yet to be given), the sphere of Jupiter encircled  by its four satellites, the crescent Moon, its imperfections clearly  shown, and a comet. Thus Father Riccioli summarized the astronomical  knowledge of his day. The scrolls quote Psalms 19:2, \"Day unto day  uttereth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge.\"    Astrea holds in her right hand a balance in which Riccioli's theory of  the universe (an adaptation of the Tychonic, see p. 68) far outweighs  the Copernican or heliocentric one. At her feet is the Ptolemaic  sphere, while Ptolemy himself half lies, half sits, between her and  Argus, with the comment issuing from his mouth: \"I will arise if only  I am corrected.\" His left hand rests upon the coat of arms of the  Prince of Monaco to whom the _Almagestum Novum_ is dedicated.    At the top is the Hebrew _Yah-Veh_, and the hand of God is stretched  forth in reference to the verse in the Book of Wisdom (10:20): \"But  thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number and weight.\"          CONTENTS        ILLUSTRATIONS                                                      7      PREFACE                                                            8        PART I.

The opening chapter is intended  to do no more than to review briefly the astronomical theories up to  the age of Copernicus, in order to provide a background for the better  comprehension of the work of Copernicus and its effects.    Such a study has been rendered possible only by the generous loan of  rare books by Professor Herbert D. Foster of Dartmouth College,  Professor Edwin E. Slosson of Columbia University, Doctor George A.  Plimpton and Major George Haven Putnam, both of New York, and  especially by the kindly generosity of Professor David Eugene Smith of  Teachers College who placed his unique collection of rare mathematical  books at the writer's disposal and gave her many valuable suggestions  as to available material. Professors James T. Shotwell and Harold  Jacoby of Columbia University have read parts of this study in  manuscript. The writer gratefully acknowledges her indebtedness not  only to these gentlemen, but to the many others, librarians and their  assistants, fellow-students and friends, too numerous to mention  individually, whose ready interest and whose suggestions have been of  real service, and above all to Professor James Harvey Robinson at  whose suggestion and under whose guidance the work was undertaken, and  to the Reverend Doctor Henry A. Stimson whose advice and criticism  have been an unfailing source of help and encouragement.          PART ONE    AN HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE HELIOCENTRIC THEORY OF THE UNIVERSE.          CHAPTER I.    THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASTRONOMICAL THOUGHT TO 1400 A.D.    _A Preliminary Sketch of Early Theories as a Background._      The appearances in the heavens have from earliest historic ages filled  men with wonder and awe; then they gradually became a source of  questioning, and thinkers sought for explanations of the daily and  nightly phenomena of sun, moon and stars. Scientific astronomy,  however, was an impossibility until an exact system of chronology was  devised.[1] Meanwhile men puzzled over the shape of the earth, its  position in the universe, what the stars were and why the positions of  some shifted, and what those fiery comets were that now and again  appeared and struck terror to their hearts.    [Footnote 1: The earliest observation Ptolemy uses is an Egyptian one  of an eclipse occurring March 21, 721 B.C. (Cumont: 7). [In these  references, the Roman numerals refer to the volume, the Arabic to the  page, except as stated otherwise. The full title is given in the  bibliography at the back under the author's name.]]    In answer to such questions, the Chaldean thinkers, slightly before  the rise of the Greek schools of philosophy, developed the idea of the  seven heavens in their crystalline spheres encircling the earth as  their center.[2] This conception seems to lie back of both the later  Egyptian and Hebraic cosmologies, as well as of the Ptolemaic. Through  the visits of Greek philosophers to Egyptian shores this conception  helped to shape Greek thought and so indirectly affected western  civilization. Thus our heritage in astronomical thought, as in many  other lines, comes from the Greeks and the Romans reaching Europe (in  part through Arabia and Spain), where it was shaped by the influence  of the schools down to the close of the Middle Ages when men began  anew to withstand authority in behalf of observation and were not  afraid to follow whither their reason led them.    [Footnote 2: Warren: 40. See \"Calendar\" in Hastings: _Ency. of  Religion and Ethics_.]    But not all Greek philosophers, it seems,[3] either knew or accepted  the Babylonian cosmology.[4] According to Plutarch, though Thales  (640?-546? B.C.) and later the Stoics believed the earth to be  spherical in form, Anaximander (610-546? B.C.) thought it to be like a  \"smooth stony pillar,\" Anaximenes (6th cent.) like a \"table.\"  Beginning with the followers of Thales or perhaps Parmenides (?-500  B.C.), as Diogenes Laertius claims,[5] a long line of Greek thinkers  including Plato (428?-347? B.C.) and Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) placed  the earth in the center of the universe. Whether Plato held that the  earth \"encircled\" or \"clung\" around the axis is a disputed point;[6]  but Aristotle claimed it was the fixed and immovable center around  which swung the spherical universe with its heaven of fixed stars and  its seven concentric circles of the planets kept in their places by  their transparent crystalline spheres.[7]    [Footnote 3: For a summary of recent researches, see the preface of  Heath: _Aristarchus of Samos_. For further details, see Heath: _Op.  cit._, and the writings of Kugler and Schiaparelli.]    [Footnote 4: See Plutarch: _Moralia: De placitas Philosophorum_, Lib.  I et II, (V. 264-277, 296-316).]    [Footnote 5: Diogenes Laertius: _De Vitis_, Lib.

Though this work was first published in 1830, it has never before been  translated into English. Indeed, the volumes are almost out of print.  When in Paris a few years ago the writer secured, with much difficulty,  a copy, from which this translation has been made. Notes have been added  by the translator, and illustrations by the publishers, which, it is  believed, will enhance the interest of the original work by Constant.    \"To paint Caesar in undress is not to paint Caesar,\" some one has said.  Yet men will always like to see the great 'en deshabille'. In these  volumes the hero is painted in undress. His foibles, his peculiarities,  his vices, are here depicted without reserve. But so also are his  kindness of heart, his vast intellect, his knowledge of men, his  extraordinary energy, his public spirit. The shutters are taken down,  and the workings of the mighty machinery are laid bare.    The late Prince Napoleon (who was more truly \"the nephew of his uncle\"  than was Napoleon III.), in his Napoleon and His Detractors, bitterly  assails this work of Constants attacking both its authenticity and the  correctness of its statements. But there appears no good reason to doubt  its genuineness, and the truthfulness of many of its details is amply  supported by other authorities. Notwithstanding its excesses and  follies, the great French Revolution will ever have an absorbing interest  for mankind, because it began as a struggle for the advancement of the  cause of manhood, liberty, and equal rights. It was a terribly earnest  movement; and, after the lapse of a century, interest continues unabated  in the great soldier who restored order, and organized and preserved the  new ideas by means of his Civil Code and a firm government.    Countless memoirs have been published by those who lived in those heroic  times. Yet everything which will cast new light upon the chief actors in  that great drama of humanity is still seized upon with avidity,  especially whatever concerns the Emperor.    This is not merely because he was a great conqueror; for such were, after  their fashion, Genghis Khan and Timour, and hundreds of others. But it  is because of the human interest which attaches to the wonderful career  of Napoleon and the events of which he was the central figure.    Never did poet or novelist imagine scenes so improbable. The son of an  obscure lawyer in an unimportant island becomes Emperor of the French and  King of Italy. His brothers and sisters become kings and queens. The  sons of innkeepers, notaries; lawyers, and peasants become marshals of  the empire. The Emperor, first making a West India Creole his wife and  Empress, puts her away, and marries a daughter of the haughtiest and  oldest royal house in Europe, the niece of a queen whom the people of  France had beheaded a few years before. Their son is born a king--King  of Rome. Then suddenly the pageantry dissolves, and Emperor, kings, and  queens become subjects again. Has imagination ever dreamed anything  wilder than this? The dramatic interest of this story will always  attract, but there is a deeper one. The secret spring of all those rapid  changes, and the real cause of the great interest humanity will always  feel in the story of those eventful times, is to be found in Napoleon's  own explanation--\"A career open to talents, without distinction of  birth.\" Till that day the accident of birth was the key to every honor  and every position. No man could hold even a lieutenancy in the army who  could not show four quarterings on his coat of arms.    It was as the \"armed apostle of democracy\" that Napoleon went forth  conquering and to conquer. He declared at St. Helena that he \"had always  marched supported by the opinions of six millions of men.\"    The old woman who met him incognito climbing the hill of Tarare, and  replying to his assertion that \"Napoleon was only a tyrant like the  rest,\" exclaimed, \"It may be so, but the others are the kings of the  nobility, while he is one of us, and we have chosen him ourselves,\"  expressed a great truth. As long as Napoleon represented popular  sovereignty he was invincible; but when, deeming himself strong enough to  stand alone, he endeavored to conciliate the old order of things, and,  divorcing the daughter of the people, took for a bride the daughter of  kings and allied himself with them--at that moment, like another Samson,  \"his strength departed from him.\" Disasters came as they had come to him  before, but this time the heart of the people was no longer with him. He  fell.    This man has been studied as a soldier, a statesman, an organizer, a  politician. In all he was undeniably great. But men will always like to  know something about him as a man. Can he stand that ordeal? These  volumes will answer that question. They are written by one who joined  the First Consul at the Hospice on Mt. St. Bernard, on his way to  Marengo, in June, 1800, and who was with him as his chief personal  attendant, day and night, never leaving him \"any more than his shadow\"  (eight days only) excepted until that eventful day, fourteen years later,  when, laying aside the sceptre of the greatest empire the world had known  for seventeen centuries, he walked down the horseshoe steps at  Fontainebleau in the presence of the soldiers whom he had led to victory  from Madrid to Moscow, once more a private citizen.    That men of Anglo-Saxon speech may have an opportunity to see and judge  the Emperor from \"close at hand,\" and view him as he appeared in the eyes  of his personal attendants, these volumes have been translated, and are  now submitted to the public. Though the remark of Frederick the Great  that \"No man is a hero to his valet\" is not altogether borne out in this  instance, still it will be seen that there is here nothing of that  \"divinity which doth hedge a king.\" In these volumes Napoleon appears as  a man, a very great man, still a mere man, not, a demigod. Their perusal  will doubtless lead to a truer conception of his character, as manifested  both in his good and in his evil traits. The former were natural to him;  the latter were often produced by the exceptional circumstances which  surrounded him, and the extraordinary temptations to which he was  subjected.    Certainly a truer and fuller light is cast by these volumes, upon the  colossal figure which will always remain one of the most interesting  studies in all human history.    THE TRANSLATOR.          INTRODUCTION.    By Constant.    The career of a man compelled to make his own way, who is not an artisan  or in some trade, does not usually begin till he is about twenty years of  age. Till then he vegetates, uncertain of his future, neither having,  nor being able to have, any well-defined purpose. It is only when he has  arrived at the full development of his powers, and his character and bent  of mind are shown, that he can determine his profession or calling. Not  till then does he know himself, and see his way open before him. In  fact, it is only then that he begins to live.    Reasoning in this manner, my life from my twentieth year has been thirty  years, which can be divided into equal parts, so far as days and months  are counted, but very unequal parts, considering the events which  transpired in each of those two periods of my life.    Attached to the person of the Emperor Napoleon for fifteen years, I have  seen all the men, and witnessed all the important events, which centered  around him. I have seen far more than that; for I have had under my eyes  all the circumstances of his life, the least as well as the greatest, the  most secret as well as those which are known to history,--I have had, I  repeat, incessantly under my eyes the man whose name, solitary and alone,  fills the most glorious pages of our history. Fifteen years I followed  him in his travels and his campaigns, was at his court, and saw him in  the privacy of his family. Whatever step he wished to take, whatever  order he gave, it was necessarily very difficult for the Emperor not to  admit me, even though involuntarily, into his confidence; so that without  desiring it, I have more than once found myself in the possession of  secrets I should have preferred not to know. What wonderful things  happened during those fifteen years! Those near the Emperor lived as if  in the center of a whirlwind; and so quick was the succession of  overwhelming events, that one felt dazed, as it were, and if he wished to  pause and fix his attention for a moment, there instantly came, like  another flood, a succession of events which carried him along with them  without giving him time to fix his thoughts.    Succeeding these times of activity which made one's brain whirl, there  came to me the most absolute repose in an isolated retreat where I passed  another interval of fifteen years after leaving the Emperor. But what a  contrast! To those who have lived, like myself, amid the conquests and  wonders of the Empire, what is left to-day? If the strength of our  manhood was passed amid the bustle of years so short, yet so fully  occupied, our careers were sufficiently long and fruitful, and it is time  to give ourselves up to repose. We can withdraw from the world, and  close our eyes. Can it be possible to see anything equal to what we have  seen? Such scenes do not come twice in the lifetime of any man; and  having seen them, they suffice to occupy his memory through all his  remaining years, and in retirement he can find nothing better to occupy  his leisure moments than the recollections of what he has witnessed.    Thus it has been with me. The reader will readily believe that I have  had no greater pleasure than that of recalling the memories of the years  passed in the service of the Emperor. As far as possible, I "]]]
