SMITH    Illustrated by KOSSIN    [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction  January 1955.

You must go. It  would be--it would be unthinkable if you didn't.\" Karn Slood's eyes were  pleading. He could not possibly be held responsible for his friend's  anti-social behavior and yet, Narli knew, he would somehow feel at  fault.    Narli sighed. He supposed he would have to conform to public sentiment  in this particular instance, but he was damned if he would give in  gracefully. \"After all, what's so special about the occasion? I'm just  leaving to take another teaching job, that's all.\" He took another nut.    \"That's _all_!\" Slood's face swelled with emotion. \"You can't really be  that indifferent.\"    \"Another job, that's all it is to me,\" Narli persisted. \"At an  exceptionally high salary, of course, or I wouldn't dream of accepting a  position so inconveniently located.\"    Slood was baffled and hurt and outraged. \"You have been honored by being  the first of our people to be offered an exchange professorship on  another planet,\" he said stiffly, \"and you call it 'just another job.'  Why, I would have given my right antenna to get it!\"    Narli realized that he had again overstepped the invisible boundary  between candor and tactlessness. He poked at the nuts with a stylus.    \"Honored by being the first of our species to be offered a  guinea-pigship,\" he murmured.    He had not considered this aspect of the matter before, but now that it  occurred to him, he was probably right.    \"Oh, I don't mind, really.\" He waved away the other's sudden  commiseration. \"You know I like being alone most of the time, so I won't  find that uncomfortable. Students are students, whether they're  Terrestrials or Saturnians. I suppose they'll laugh at me behind my  back, but then even here, my students always did that.\"    He gave a hollow laugh and unobtrusively put out one of his hands for a  nut. \"At least on Earth I'll know why they're laughing.\"    There was pain on Slood's expressive face as he firmly removed the nut  tray from his friend's reach. \"I didn't think of it from that angle,  Narli. Of course you're right. Human beings, from what I've read of  them, are not noted for tolerance. It will be difficult, but I'm sure  you'll be able to--\" he choked on the kindly lie--\"win them over.\"    Narli repressed a bitter laugh. Anyone less likely than he to win over a  hostile alien species through sheer personal charm could hardly be found  on Saturn. Narli Gzann had been chosen as first exchange professor  between Saturn and Earth because of his academic reputation, not his  personality. But although the choosers had probably not had that aspect  of the matter in mind, the choice, he thought, was a wise one.    As an individual of solitary habits, he was not apt to be much lonelier  on one planet than another.    And he had accepted the post largely because he felt that, as an alien  being, he would be left strictly alone. This would give him the chance  to put in a lot of work on his definitive history of the Solar System, a  monumental project from which he begrudged all the time he had to spend  in fulfilling even the minimum obligations expected of a professor on  sociable Saturn.    The salary was a weighty factor, too--not only was it more than twice  what he had been getting, but since there would be no necessity for  spending more than enough for bare subsistence he would be able to save  up a considerable amount and retire while still comparatively young. It  was pleasant to imagine a scholarly life unafflicted by students.    He could put up with a good deal for that goal.    But how could he alleviate the distress he saw on Karn's face? He did  not consciously want to hurt the only person who, for some strange  reason, seemed to be fond of him, so he said the only thing he could  think of to please: \"All right, Karn, I'll go to the Perzils tomorrow  night.\"    It would be a deadly bore--parties always were--and he would eat too  much, but, after all, the thought that it would be a long time before  he'd ever see any of his own kind again would make the affair almost  endurable. And just this once it would be all right for him to eat as  much as he wanted. When he was on Earth out of reach of decent food, he  would probably trim down considerably.           *       *       *       *       *    \"I just _know_ you're going to love Earth, Professor Gzann,\" the hostess  on the interplanetary liner gushed.    \"I'm sure I shall,\" he lied politely. She smiled at him too much,  over-doing her professional cordiality; underneath the effusiveness, he  sensed the repulsion. Of course he couldn't blame her for trying not to  show her distaste for the strange creature--the effort at concealment  was, as a matter of fact, more than he had expected from a Terrestrial.  But he wished she would leave him alone to meditate. He had planned to  get a lot of meditation done on the journey.    \"You speak awfully good English,\" she told him.    He looked at her. \"I am said to have some scholarly aptitude. I  understand that's why I was chosen as an exchange professor. It does  seem reasonable, doesn't it?\"    She turned pink--a sign of embarrassment with these creatures, he had  learned. \"I didn't mean to--to question your ability, Professor. It's  just that--well, you don't look like a professor.\"    \"Indeed?\" he said frostily. \"And what do I look like, then?\"    She turned even rosier. \"Oh--I--I don't know exactly. It's just  that--well....\" And she fled.    He couldn't resist flicking his antennae forward to catch her _sotto  voce_ conversation with the co-pilot; it was so seldom you got the  chance to learn what others were saying about you behind your back. \"But  I could hardly tell him he looks like a teddy bear, could I?\"    \"He probably doesn't even know what a teddy bear is.\"    \"Perhaps I don't,\" Narli thought resentfully, \"but I can guess.\"    With low cunning, the Terrestrials seemed to have ferreted out the  identity of all his favorite dishes and kept serving them to him  incessantly. By the time the ship made planetfall on Earth, he had  gained ten grisbuts.    \"Oh, well,\" he thought, \"I suppose it's all just part of the regular  diplomatic service. On Earth, I'll have to eat crude native foods, so  I'll lose all the weight again.\"    President Purrington of North America came himself to meet Narli at the  airfield because Narli was the first interplanetary exchange professor  in history.    \"Welcome to our planet, Professor Gzann,\" he said with warm diplomatic  cordiality, wringing Narli's upper right hand after a moment of  indecision. \"We shall do everything in our power to make your stay here  a happy and memorable one.\"    \"I wish you would begin by doing something about the climate,\" Narli  thought. It was stupid of him not to have realized how hot it would be  on Earth. He was really going to suffer in this torrid climate;  especially in the tight Terrestrial costume he wore over his fur for the  sake of conformity. Of course, justice compelled him to admit to  himself, the clothes wouldn't have become so snug if he hadn't eaten  quite so much on board ship.    Purrington indicated the female beside him. \"May I introduce my wife?\"    \"Ohhh,\" the female gasped, \"isn't he _cute_!\"    The President and Narli stared at her in consternation. She looked  abashed for a moment, then smiled widely at Narli and the press  photographers.    \"Welcome to Earth, dear Professor Gzann!\" she exclaimed, mispronouncing  his name, of course. Bending down, she kissed him right upon his fuzzy  forehead.    Kissing was not a Saturnian practice, nor did Narli approve of it;  however, he had read enough about Earth to know that Europeans sometimes  greeted dignitaries in this peculiar way. Only this place, he had been  given to understand, was not Europe but America.    [Illustration]    \"I am having a cocktail party in your honor this afternoon!\" she beamed,  smoothing her flowered print dress down over her girdle. \"You'll be  there at five sharp, won't you, dear?\"    \"Delighted,\" he promised dismally. He could hardly plead a previous  engagement a moment after arriving.    \"I've tried to get all the things you like to eat,\" she went on  anxiously, \"but you will tell me if there's anything special, won't  you?\"    \"I am on a diet,\" he said. He must be strong. Probably the food would be  repulsive anyhow, so he'd have no difficulty controlling his appetite.  \"Digestive disorders, you know. A glass of Vichy and a biscuit will  be....\"    He stopped, for there were tears in Mrs. Purrington's eyes. \"Your tummy  hurts? Oh, you poor little darling!\"    \"Gladys!\" the President said sharply.    There were frismil nuts at Mrs. Purrington's cocktail party and vilbar  and even slipnis broogs ... all imported at fabulous expense, Narli  knew, but then this was a government affair and expense means nothing to  a government since, as far as it is concerned, money grows on taxpayers.  Some of the native foods proved surprisingly palatable, too--pate de  foie gras and champagne and little puff pastries full of delightful  surprises. Narli was afraid he was making a zloogle of himself. However,  he thought, trying not to catch sight of his own portly person in the  mirrors that walled the room, the lean days were just "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3163"],[0,"Birds and Bees, Sharp Eyes, and Other Papers (#1)"],[1,"Duvall, Cheri Ripley, and Cheryl Sullivan              BIRDS AND BEES    SHARP EYES    AND OTHER PAPERS      By John Burroughs      With An Introduction    By Mary E.

Nature chose the spring of the year for the time of John Burroughs's  birth. A little before the day when the wake-robin shows itself, that  the observer might be on hand for the sight, he was born in Roxbury,  Delaware County, New York, on the western borders of the Catskill  Mountains; the precise date was April 3, 1837. Until 1863 he remained  in the country about his native place, working on his father's farm,  getting his schooling in the district school and neighboring academies,  and taking his turn also as teacher. As he himself has hinted, the  originality, freshness, and wholesomeness of his writings are probably  due in great measure to the unliterary surroundings of his early life,  which allowed his mind to form itself on unconventional lines, and to  the later companionships with unlettered men, which kept him in touch  with the sturdy simplicities of life.    From the very beginnings of his taste for literature, the essay was his  favorite form. Dr. Johnson was the prophet of his youth, but he soon  transferred his allegiance to Emerson, who for many years remained his  \"master enchanter.\" To cure himself of too close an imitation of  the Concord seer, which showed itself in his first magazine article,  Expression, he took to writing his sketches of nature, and about this  time he fell in with the writings of Thoreau, which doubtless confirmed  and encouraged him in this direction. But of all authors and of all men,  Walt Whitman, in his personality and as a literary force, seems to have  made the profoundest impression upon Mr. Burroughs, though doubtless  Emerson had a greater influence on his style of writing.    Expression appeared in The Atlantic Monthly in 1860, and most of his  contributions to literature have been in the form of papers first  published in the magazines, and afterwards collected into books. He more  than once paid tribute to his teachers in literature. His first book,  now out of print, was Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person,  published in 1867; and Whitman: A Study, which appeared in 1896, is a  more extended treatment of the man and his poetry and philosophy. Birds  and Poets, too, contains a paper on Whitman, entitled The Flight of the  Eagle, besides an essay on Emerson, whom he also treated incidentally in  his paper, Matthew Arnold on Emerson and Carlyle, in Indoor Studies; and  the latter volume contains his essay on Thoreau.    In the autumn of 1863 he went to Washington, and in the following  January entered the Treasury Department. He was for some years an  assistant in the office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and later  chief of the organization division of that Bureau. For some time he was  keeper of one of the vaults, and for a great part of the day his only  duty was to be at his desk. In these leisure hours his mind traveled off  into the country, where his previous life had been spent, and with the  help of his pen, always a faithful friend and magician, he lived over  again those happy days, now happier still with the glamour of all  past pleasures. In this way he wrote Wake-Robin and a part of Winter  Sunshine. It must not be supposed, however, that he was deprived of  outdoor pleasures while at Washington. On the contrary, he enjoyed many  walks in the suburbs of the capital, and in those days the real country  came up to the very edges of the city. His Spring at the Capital, Winter  Sunshine, A March Chronicle, and other papers bear the fruit of his life  on the Potomac. He went to England in 1871 on business for the Treasury  Department, and again on his own account a dozen years later. The record  of the two visits is to be found mainly in his chapters on An October  Abroad, contained in the volume Winter Sunshine, and in the papers  gathered into the volume Fresh Fields.    He resigned his place in the Treasury in 1873, and was appointed  receiver of a broken national bank. Later, until 1885, his business  occupation was that of a National Bank Examiner. An article contributed  by him to The Century Magazine for March, 1881, on Broken Banks and Lax  Directors, is perhaps the only literary outcome of this occupation, but  the keen powers of observation, trained in the field of nature, could  not fail to disclose themselves in analyzing columns of figures. After  leaving Washington Mr. Burroughs bought a fruit farm at West Park, near  Esopus, on the Hudson, and there building his house from the stones  found in his fields, has given himself the best conditions for that  humanizing of nature which constitutes the charm of his books. He was  married in 1857 to a lady living in the New York village where he was  at the time teaching. He keeps his country home the year round, only  occasionally visiting New York. The cultivation of grapes absorbs the  greater part of his time; but he has by no means given over letters. His  work, which has long found ready acceptance both at home and abroad,  is now passing into that security of fame which comes from its entrance  into the school-life of American children.    Besides his outdoor sketches and the other papers already mentioned,  Mr. Burroughs has written a number of critical essays on life and  literature, published in Indoor Studies, and other volumes. He has also  taken his readers into his confidence in An Egotistical Chapter,  the final one of his Indoor Studies; and in the Introduction to the  Riverside Edition of his writings he has given us further glimpses of  his private intellectual life.    Probably no other American writer has a greater sympathy with, and a  keener enjoyment of, country life in all its phases--farming, camping,  fishing, walking--than has John Burroughs. His books are redolent of the  soil, and have such \"freshness and primal sweetness,\" that we need not  be told that the pleasure he gets from his walks and excursions is by no  means over when he steps inside his doors again. As he tells us on more  than one occasion, he finds he can get much more out of his outdoor  experiences by thinking them over, and writing them out afterwards.    Numbers 28, 36, and 92 of the Riverside Literature Series consist of  selections from Mr. Burroughs's books. No. 28, which is entitled Birds  and Bees, is made up of Bird Enemies and The Tragedies of the Nests from  the volume Signs and Seasons, An Idyl of the Honey-Bee from Pepacton,  and The Pastoral Bees from Locusts and Wild Honey. The Introduction,  by Miss Mary E. Burt, gives an account of the use of Mr. Burroughs's  writings in Chicago schools.    In No. 36, Sharp Eyes, and Other Papers, the initial paper, Sharp  Eyes, is drawn from Locusts and Wild Honey, The Apple comes from Winter  Sunshine, A Taste of Maine Birch and Winter Neighbors from Signs and  Seasons, and Notes by the Way (on muskrats, squirrels, foxes, and  woodchucks) from Pepacton.    The collection called A Bunch of Herbs, and Other Papers, forming No.  92 of the Series, was designed with special reference to what the author  has to say of trees and flowers, and contains A Bunch of Herbs from  Pepacton, Strawberries from Locusts and Wild Honey, A March Chronicle  and Autumn Tides from Winter Sunshine, A Spray of Pine and A Spring  Relish from Signs and Seasons, and English Woods: A Contrast from Fresh  Fields.          INTRODUCTION.        It is seldom that I find a book so far above children that I cannot  share its best thought with them. So when I first took up one of John  Burroughs's essays, I at once foresaw many a ramble with my pupils  through the enchanted country that is found within its breezy pages. To  read John Burroughs is to live in the woods and fields, and to associate  intimately with all their little timid inhabitants; to learn that--       \"God made all the creatures and gave them our love and our fear,      To give sign, we and they are his children, one family here.\"    When I came to use Pepacton in my class of the sixth grade, I soon  found, not only that the children read better but that they came rapidly  to a better appreciation of the finer bits of literature in their  regular readers, while their interest in their new author grew quickly  to an enthusiasm. Never was a little brother or sister more real to  them than was \"Peggy Mel\" as she rushed into the hive laden with stolen  honey, while her neighbors gossiped about it, or the stately elm that  played sly tricks, or the log which proved to be a good bedfellow  because it did not grumble. Burroughs's way of investing beasts, birds,  insects, and inanimate things with human motives is very pleasing  to children. They like to trace analogies between the human and the  irrational, to think of a weed as a tramp stealing rides, of Nature as a  tell-tale when taken by surprise.    The quiet enthusiasm of John Burroughs's essays is much healthier  than the over-wrought dramatic action which sets all the nerves  a-quiver,--nerves already stimulated to excess by the comedies and  tragedies forced upon the daily lives of children. It is especially  true of children living in crowded cities, shut away from the woods and  hills, constant witnesses of the effects of human passion, that they  need the tonic of a quiet literature rather than the stimulant of a  stormy or dramatic one,--a literature which develops gentle feelings,  deep thought, and a relish for what is homely and homespun, rather than  a literature which calls forth excited feelings.    The essays in this volume are those in which my pupils have expressed an  enthusiastic interest, or which, after "]]]
