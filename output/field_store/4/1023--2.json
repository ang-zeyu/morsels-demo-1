A strange story comes from the Adriatic.  It appears that on the night of  the 9th, as the Italia Steamship Company's vessel \"Victorine\" was passing  a little before midnight the point known as \"the Spear of Ivan,\" on the  coast of the Blue Mountains, the attention of the Captain, then on the  bridge, was called by the look-out man to a tiny floating light close  inshore.  It is the custom of some South-going ships to run close to the  Spear of Ivan in fine weather, as the water is deep, and there is no  settled current; also there are no outlying rocks.  Indeed, some years  ago the local steamers had become accustomed to hug the shore here so  closely that an intimation was sent from Lloyd's that any mischance under  the circumstances would not be included in ordinary sea risks.  Captain  Mirolani is one of those who insist on a wholesome distance from the  promontory being kept; but on his attention having been called to the  circumstance reported, he thought it well to investigate it, as it might  be some case of personal distress.  Accordingly, he had the engines  slowed down, and edged cautiously in towards shore.  He was joined on the  bridge by two of his officers, Signori Falamano and Destilia, and by one  passenger on board, Mr. Peter Caulfield, whose reports of Spiritual  Phenomena in remote places are well known to the readers of \"The Journal  of Occultism.\"  The following account of the strange occurrence written  by him, and attested by the signatures of Captain Mirolani and the other  gentleman named, has been sent to us.    \" . . . It was eleven minutes before twelve midnight on Saturday, the 9th  day of January, 1907, when I saw the strange sight off the headland known  as the Spear of Ivan on the coast of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  It  was a fine night, and I stood right on the bows of the ship, where there  was nothing to obstruct my view.  We were some distance from the Spear of  Ivan, passing from northern to southern point of the wide bay into which  it projects.  Captain Mirolani, the Master, is a very careful seaman, and  gives on his journeys a wide berth to the bay which is tabooed by  Lloyd's.  But when he saw in the moonlight, though far off, a tiny white  figure of a woman drifting on some strange current in a small boat, on  the prow of which rested a faint light (to me it looked like a  corpse-candle!), he thought it might be some person in distress, and  began to cautiously edge towards it.  Two of his officers were with him  on the bridge--Signori Falamano and Destilia.  All these three, as well  as myself, saw It.  The rest of the crew and passengers were below.  As  we got close the true inwardness of It became apparent to me; but the  mariners did not seem to realize till the very last.  This is, after all,  not strange, for none of them had either knowledge or experience in  Occult matters, whereas for over thirty years I have made a special study  of this subject, and have gone to and fro over the earth investigating to  the nth all records of Spiritual Phenomena.  As I could see from their  movements that the officers did not comprehend that which was so apparent  to myself, I took care not to enlighten them, lest such should result in  the changing of the vessel's course before I should be near enough to  make accurate observation.  All turned out as I wished--at least, nearly  so--as shall be seen.  Being in the bow, I had, of course, a better view  than from the bridge.   Presently I made out that the boat, which had all  along seemed to be of a queer shape, was none other than a _Coffin_, and  that the woman standing up in it was clothed in a shroud.  Her back was  towards us, and she had evidently not heard our approach.  As we were  creeping along slowly, the engines were almost noiseless, and there was  hardly a ripple as our fore-foot cut the dark water.  Suddenly there was  a wild cry from the bridge--Italians are certainly very excitable; hoarse  commands were given to the Quartermaster at the wheel; the engine-room  bell clanged.  On the instant, as it seemed, the ship's head began to  swing round to starboard; full steam ahead was in action, and before one  could understand, the Apparition was fading in the distance.  The last  thing I saw was the flash of a white face with dark, burning eyes as the  figure sank down into the coffin--just as mist or smoke disappears under  a breeze.\"          BOOK I: THE WILL OF ROGER MELTON      The Reading of the Will of Roger Melton and all that Followed      Record made by Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, law-student of the Inner  Temple, eldest son of Ernest Halbard Melton, eldest son of Ernest Melton,  elder brother of the said Roger Melton and his next of kin.    I consider it at least useful--perhaps necessary--to have a complete and  accurate record of all pertaining to the Will of my late grand-uncle  Roger Melton.    To which end let me put down the various members of his family, and  explain some of their occupations and idiosyncrasies.  My father, Ernest  Halbard Melton, was the only son of Ernest Melton, eldest son of Sir  Geoffrey Halbard Melton of Humcroft, in the shire of Salop, a Justice of  the Peace, and at one time Sheriff.  My great-grandfather, Sir Geoffrey,  had inherited a small estate from his father, Roger Melton.  In his time,  by the way, the name was spelled Milton; but my great-great-grandfather  changed the spelling to the later form, as he was a practical man not  given to sentiment, and feared lest he should in the public eye be  confused with others belonging to the family of a Radical person called  Milton, who wrote poetry and was some sort of official in the time of  Cromwell, whilst we are Conservatives.  The same practical spirit which  originated the change in the spelling of the family name inclined him to  go into business.  So he became, whilst still young, a tanner and  leather-dresser.  He utilized for the purpose the ponds and streams, and  also the oak-woods on his estate--Torraby in Suffolk.  He made a fine  business, and accumulated a considerable fortune, with a part of which he  purchased the Shropshire estate, which he entailed, and to which I am  therefore heir-apparent.    Sir Geoffrey had, in addition to my grandfather, three sons and a  daughter, the latter being born twenty years after her youngest brother.  These sons were: Geoffrey, who died without issue, having been killed in  the Indian Mutiny at Meerut in 1857, at which he took up a sword, though  a civilian, to fight for his life; Roger (to whom I shall refer  presently); and John--the latter, like Geoffrey, dying unmarried.  Out of  Sir Geoffrey's family of five, therefore, only three have to be  considered: My grandfather, who had three children, two of whom, a son  and a daughter, died young, leaving only my father, Roger and Patience.  Patience, who was born in 1858, married an Irishman of the name of  Sellenger--which was the usual way of pronouncing the name of St. Leger,  or, as they spelled it, Sent Leger--restored by later generations to the  still older form.  He was a reckless, dare-devil sort of fellow, then a  Captain in the Lancers, a man not without the quality of bravery--he won  the Victoria Cross at the Battle of Amoaful in the Ashantee Campaign.  But I fear he lacked the seriousness and steadfast strenuous purpose  which my father always says marks the character of our own family.  He  ran through nearly all of his patrimony--never a very large one; and had  it not been for my grand-aunt's little fortune, his days, had he lived,  must have ended in comparative poverty.  Comparative, not actual; for the  Meltons, who are persons of considerable pride, would not have tolerated  a poverty-stricken branch of the family.  We don't think much of that  lot--any of us.    Fortunately, my great-aunt Patience had only one child, and the premature  decease of Captain St. Leger (as I prefer to call the name) did not allow  of the possibility of her having more.  She did not marry again, though  my grandmother tried several times to arrange an alliance for her.  She  was, I am told, always a stiff, uppish person, who would not yield  herself to the wisdom of her superiors.  Her own child was a son, who  seemed to take his character rather from his father's family than from my  own.  He was a wastrel and a rolling stone, always in scrapes at school,  and always wanting to do ridiculous things.  My father, as Head of the  House and his own senior by eighteen years, tried often to admonish him;  but his perversity of spirit and his truculence were such that he had to  desist.  Indeed, I have heard my father say that he sometimes threatened  his life.  A desperate character he was, and almost devoid of reverence.  No one, not even my father, had any influence--good influence, of course,  I mean--over him, except his mother, who was of my family; and also a  woman who lived with her--a sort of governess--aunt, he called her.  The  way of it was this: Captain St. Leger had a younger brother, who made an  improvident marriage with a Scotch girl when they were both very young.  They had nothing to live on except what the reckless"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31"],[0,"Plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone (#1)"],[1,"OEDIPUS THE KING                         Translation by F.

So when  in time a son was born the infant's feet were riveted together and he  was left to die on Mount Cithaeron. But a shepherd found the babe and  tended him, and delivered him to another shepherd who took him to his  master, the King of Corinth. Polybus being childless adopted the boy,  who grew up believing that he was indeed the King's son. Afterwards  doubting his parentage he inquired of the Delphic god and heard himself  the word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he fled from what he  deemed his father's house and in his flight he encountered and  unwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the  riddle of the Sphinx and the grateful Thebans made their deliverer king.  So he reigned in the room of Laius, and espoused the widowed queen.  Children were born to them and Thebes prospered under his rule, but  again a grievous plague fell upon the city. Again the oracle was  consulted and it bade them purge themselves of blood-guiltiness. Oedipus  denounces the crime of which he is unaware, and undertakes to track out  the criminal. Step by step it is brought home to him that he is the man.  The closing scene reveals Jocasta slain by her own hand and Oedipus  blinded by his own act and praying for death or exile.                                  *****                              DRAMATIS PERSONAE                                   Oedipus.

To them enter OEDIPUS.    OEDIPUS  My children, latest born to Cadmus old,  Why sit ye here as suppliants, in your hands  Branches of olive filleted with wool?  What means this reek of incense everywhere,  And everywhere laments and litanies?  Children, it were not meet that I should learn  From others, and am hither come, myself,  I Oedipus, your world-renowned king.  Ho! aged sire, whose venerable locks  Proclaim thee spokesman of this company,  Explain your mood and purport.  Is it dread  Of ill that moves you or a boon ye crave?  My zeal in your behalf ye cannot doubt;  Ruthless indeed were I and obdurate  If such petitioners as you I spurned.    PRIEST  Yea, Oedipus, my sovereign lord and king,  Thou seest how both extremes of age besiege  Thy palace altars--fledglings hardly winged,  and greybeards bowed with years; priests, as am I  of Zeus, and these the flower of our youth.  Meanwhile, the common folk, with wreathed boughs  Crowd our two market-places, or before  Both shrines of Pallas congregate, or where  Ismenus gives his oracles by fire.  For, as thou seest thyself, our ship of State,  Sore buffeted, can no more lift her head,  Foundered beneath a weltering surge of blood.  A blight is on our harvest in the ear,  A blight upon the grazing flocks and herds,  A blight on wives in travail; and withal  Armed with his blazing torch the God of Plague  Hath swooped upon our city emptying  The house of Cadmus, and the murky realm  Of Pluto is full fed with groans and tears.       Therefore, O King, here at thy hearth we sit,  I and these children; not as deeming thee  A new divinity, but the first of men;  First in the common accidents of life,  And first in visitations of the Gods.  Art thou not he who coming to the town  of Cadmus freed us from the tax we paid  To the fell songstress?  Nor hadst thou received  Prompting from us or been by others schooled;  No, by a god inspired (so all men deem,  And testify) didst thou renew our life.  And now, O Oedipus, our peerless king,  All we thy votaries beseech thee, find  Some succor, whether by a voice from heaven  Whispered, or haply known by human wit.  Tried counselors, methinks, are aptest found [1]  To furnish for the future pregnant rede.  Upraise, O chief of men, upraise our State!  Look to thy laurels! for thy zeal of yore  Our country's savior thou art justly hailed:  O never may we thus record thy reign:--  \"He raised us up only to cast us down.\"  Uplift us, build our city on a rock.  Thy happy star ascendant brought us luck,  O let it not decline!  If thou wouldst rule  This land, as now thou reignest, better sure  To rule a peopled than a desert realm.  Nor battlements nor galleys aught avail,  If men to man and guards to guard them tail.    OEDIPUS  Ah! my poor children, known, ah, known too well,  The quest that brings you hither and your need.  Ye sicken all, well wot I, yet my pain,  How great soever yours, outtops it all.  Your sorrow touches each man severally,  Him and none other, but I grieve at once  Both for the general and myself and you.  Therefore ye rouse no sluggard from day-dreams.  Many, my children, are the tears I've wept,  And threaded many a maze of weary thought.  Thus pondering one clue of hope I caught,  And tracked it up; I have sent Menoeceus' son,  Creon, my consort's brother, to inquire  Of Pythian Phoebus at his Delphic shrine,  How I might save the State by act or word.  And now I reckon up the tale of days  Since he set forth, and marvel how he fares.  'Tis strange, this endless tarrying, passing strange.  But when he comes, then I were base indeed,  If I perform not all the god declares.    PRIEST  Thy words are well timed; even as thou speakest  That shouting tells me Creon is at hand.    OEDIPUS  O King Apollo! may his joyous looks  Be presage of the joyous news he brings!    PRIEST  As I surmise, 'tis welcome; else his head  Had scarce been crowned with berry-laden bays.    OEDIPUS  We soon shall know; he's now in earshot range.  [Enter CREON]  My royal cousin, say, Menoeceus' child,  What message hast thou brought us from the god?    CREON  Good news, for e'en intolerable ills,  Finding right issue, tend to naught but good.    OEDIPUS  How runs the oracle? thus far thy words  Give me no ground for confidence or fear.    CREON  If thou wouldst hear my message publicly,  I'll tell thee straight, or with thee pass within.    OEDIPUS  Speak before all; the burden that I bear  Is more for these my subjects than myself.    CREON  Let me report then all the god declared.  King Phoebus bids us straitly extirpate  A fell pollution that infests the land,  And no more harbor an inveterate sore.    OEDIPUS  What expiation means he?  What's amiss?    CREON  Banishment, or the shedding blood for blood.  This stain of blood makes shipwreck of our state.    OEDIPUS  Whom can he mean, the miscreant thus denounced?    CREON  Before thou didst assume the helm of State,  The sovereign of this land was Laius.    OEDIPUS  I heard as much, but never saw the man.    CREON  He fell; and now the god's command is plain:  Punish his takers-off, whoe'er they be.    OEDIPUS  Where are they?  Where in the wide world to find  The far, faint traces of a bygone crime?    CREON  In this land, said the god; \"who seeks shall find;  Who sits with folded hands or sleeps is blind.\"    OEDIPUS  Was he within his palace, or afield,  Or traveling, when Laius met his fate?    CREON  Abroad; he started, so he told us, bound  For Delphi, but he never thence returned.    OEDIPUS  Came there no news, no fellow-traveler  To give some clue that might be followed up?    CREON  But one escape, who flying for dear life,  Could tell of all he saw but one thing sure.    OEDIPUS  And what was that?  One clue might lead us far,  With but a spark of hope to guide our quest.    CREON  Robbers, he told us, not one bandit but  A troop of knaves, attacked and murdered him.    OEDIPUS  Did any bandit dare so bold a stroke,  Unless indeed he were suborned from Thebes?    CREON  So 'twas surmised, but none was found to avenge  His murder mid the trouble that ensued.    OEDIPUS  What trouble can have hindered a full quest,  When royalty had fallen thus miserably?    CREON  The riddling Sphinx compelled us to let slide  The dim past and attend to instant needs.    OEDIPUS  Well, _I_ will start afresh and once again  Make dark things clear.  Right worthy the concern  Of Phoebus, worthy thine too, for the dead;  I also, as is meet, will lend my aid  To avenge this wrong to Thebes and to the god.  Not for some far-off kinsman, but myself,  Shall I expel this poison in the blood;  For whoso slew that king might have a mind  To strike me too with his assassin hand.  Therefore in righting him I serve myself.  Up, children, haste ye, quit these altar stairs,  Take hence your suppliant wands, go summon hither  The Theban commons.  With the god's good help  Success is sure; 'tis ruin if we fail.  [Exeunt OEDIPUS and CREON]    PRIEST  Come, children, let us hence; these gracious words  Forestall the very purpose of our suit.  And may the god who sent this oracle  Save us withal and rid us of this pest.
