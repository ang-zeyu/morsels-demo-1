The Fountain of Oblivion          To My Readers      Curiously enough, in the events which have taken place in the last few  years in our \"great outside world,\" we may find incidents so marvelous  and inspiring that I cannot hope to equal them with stories of The Land  of Oz.    However, \"The Magic of Oz\" is really more strange and unusual than  anything I have read or heard about on our side of The Great Sandy  Desert which shuts us off from The Land of Oz, even during the past  exciting years, so I hope it will appeal to your love of novelty.    A long and confining illness has prevented my answering all the good  letters sent me--unless stamps were enclosed--but from now on I hope to  be able to give prompt attention to each and every letter with which my  readers favor me.    Assuring you that my love for you has never faltered and hoping the Oz  Books will continue to give you pleasure as long as I am able to write  them, I am    Yours affectionately,      L. FRANK BAUM,    \"Royal Historian of Oz.\"    \"OZCOT\"    at HOLLYWOOD    in CALIFORNIA    1919          1.  Mount Munch      On the east edge of the Land of Oz, in the Munchkin Country, is a big,  tall hill called Mount Munch.  One one side, the bottom of this hill  just touches the Deadly Sandy Desert that separates the Fairyland of Oz  from all the rest of the world, but on the other side, the hill touches  the beautiful, fertile Country of the Munchkins.    The Munchkin folks, however, merely stand off and look at Mount Munch  and know very little about it; for, about a third of the way up, its  sides become too steep to climb, and if any people live upon the top of  that great towering peak that seems to reach nearly to the skies, the  Munchkins are not aware of the fact.    But people DO live there, just the same.  The top of Mount Munch is  shaped like a saucer, broad and deep, and in the saucer are fields  where grains and vegetables grow, and flocks are fed, and brooks flow  and trees bear all sorts of things.  There are houses scattered here  and there, each having its family of Hyups, as the people call  themselves.  The Hyups seldom go down the mountain, for the same reason  that the Munchkins never climb up: the sides are too steep.    In one of the houses lived a wise old Hyup named Bini Aru, who used to  be a clever Sorcerer.  But Ozma of Oz, who rules everyone in the Land  of Oz, had made a decree that no one should practice magic in her  dominions except Glinda the Good and the Wizard of Oz, and when Glinda  sent this royal command to the Hyups by means of a strong-winged Eagle,  old Bini Aru at once stopped performing magical arts.  He destroyed  many of his magic powders and tools of magic, and afterward honestly  obeyed the law.  He had never seen Ozma, but he knew she was his Ruler  and must be obeyed.    There was only one thing that grieved him.  He had discovered a new and  secret method of transformations that was unknown to any other  Sorcerer.  Glinda the Good did not know it, nor did the little Wizard  of Oz, nor Dr. Pipt nor old Mombi, nor anyone else who dealt in magic  arts.  It was Bini Aru's own secret.  By its means, it was the simplest  thing in the world to transform anyone into beast, bird or fish, or  anything else, and back again, once you know how to pronounce the  mystical word: \"Pyrzqxgl.\"    Bini Aru had used this secret many times, but not to cause evil or  suffering to others.  When he had wandered far from home and was  hungry, he would say: \"I want to become a cow--Pyrzqxgl!\" In an instant  he would be a cow, and then he would eat grass and satisfy his hunger.  All beasts and birds can talk in the Land of Oz, so when the cow was no  longer hungry, it would say: \"I want to be Bini Aru again: Pyrzqxgl!\"  and the magic word, properly pronounced, would instantly restore him to  his proper form.    Now, of course, I would not dare to write down this magic word so  plainly if I thought my readers would pronounce it properly and so be  able to transform themselves and others, but it is a fact that no one  in all the world except Bini Aru, had ever (up to the time this story  begins) been able to pronounce \"Pyrzqxgl!\" the right way, so I think it  is safe to give it to you.  It might be well, however, in reading this  story aloud, to be careful not to pronounce Pyrzqxgl the proper way,  and thus avoid all danger of the secret being able to work mischief.    Bini Aru, having discovered the secret of instant transformation, which  required no tools or powders or other chemicals or herbs and always  worked perfectly, was reluctant to have such a wonderful discovery  entirely unknown or lost to all human knowledge.  He decided not to use  it again, since Ozma had forbidden him to do so, but he reflected that  Ozma was a girl and some time might change her mind and allow her  subjects to practice magic, in which case Bini Aru could again  transform himself and others at will,--unless, of course, he forgot how  to pronounce Pyrzqxgl in the meantime.    After giving the matter careful thought, he decided to write the word,  and how it should be pronounced, in some secret place, so that he could  find it after many years, but where no one else could ever find it.    That was a clever idea, but what bothered the old Sorcerer was to find  a secret place.  He wandered all over the Saucer at the top of Mount  Munch, but found no place in which to write the secret word where  others might not be likely to stumble upon it.  So finally he decided  it must be written somewhere in his own house.    Bini Aru had a wife named Mopsi Aru who was famous for making fine  huckleberry pies, and he had a son named Kiki Aru who was not famous at  all.  He was noted as being cross and disagreeable because he was not  happy, and he was not happy because he wanted to go down the mountain  and visit the big world below and his father would not let him.  No one  paid any attention to Kiki Aru, because he didn't amount to anything,  anyway.    Once a year there was a festival on Mount Munch which all the Hyups  attended.  It was held in the center of the saucer-shaped country, and  the day was given over to feasting and merry-making.  The young folks  danced and sang songs; the women spread the tables with good things to  eat, and the men played on musical instruments and told fairy tales.    Kiki Aru usually went to these festivals with his parents, and then sat  sullenly outside the circle and would not dance or sing or even talk to  the other young people.  So the festival did not make him any happier  than other days, and this time he told Bini Aru and Mopsi Aru that he  would not go.  He would rather stay at home and be unhappy all by  himself, he said, and so they gladly let him stay.    But after he was left alone Kiki decided to enter his father's private  room, where he was forbidden to go, and see if he could find any of the  magic tools Bini Aru used to work with when he practiced sorcery.  As  he went in Kiki stubbed his toe on one of the floor boards.  He  searched everywhere but found no trace of his father's magic.  All had  been destroyed.    Much disappointed, he started to go out again when he stubbed his toe  on the same floor board.  That set him thinking.  Examining the board  more closely, Kiki found it had been pried up and then nailed down  again in such a manner that it was a little higher than the other  boards.  But why had his father taken up the board?  Had he hidden some  of his magic tools underneath the floor?    Kiki got a chisel and pried up the board, but found nothing under it.  He was just about to replace the board when it slipped from his hand  and turned over, and he saw something written on the underside of it.  The light was rather dim, so he took the board to the window and  examined it, and found that the writing described exactly how to  pronounce the magic word Pyrzqxgl, which would transform anyone into  anything instantly, and back again when the word was repeated.    Now, at first, Kiki Aru didn't realize what a wonderful secret he had  discovered; but he thought it might be of use to him and so he took a  piece of paper and made on it an exact copy of the instructions for  pronouncing Pyrzqxgl.  Then he folded the paper and put it in his  pocket, and replaced the board in the floor so that no one would  suspect it had been removed.    After this Kiki went into the garden and sitting beneath a tree made a  careful study of the paper.  He had always wanted to get away from  Mount Munch and visit the big world--especially the Land of Oz--and the  idea now came to him that if he could transform himself into a bird, he  could fly to any place he wished to go and fly back again whenever he  cared to.  It was necessary, however, to learn by heart the way to  pronounce the magic word, because a bird would have no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41934"],[0,"Idling in Italy: Studies of literature and of life (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

K. C.      ... Io vengo di lontana parte,    Dov'era lo tuo cuor.          PREFACE      Nothing obstacled my pleasure so much when I first went to Italy as  unfamiliarity with its literature. Every one who would add to his  spiritual stature and his emotional equanimity by tarry in Italy should  have some intimacy with the Bible, with mythology, and with Italian  writers, especially the poets. I sought books about books but was not  very successful in finding them. Interpretative articles on men and  books which are so common in British and American literature are  exceptional in Italy. One who is ambitious to get even a bowing  acquaintance with them must make the introduction himself. In 1918 an  enterprising Italian, Signor A. T. Formiggini, attempted to supply such  introduction by the publication of a literary review called _L'Italia  Che Scrive_, a monthly supplement to all the periodicals. He has had  gratifying success.    My purpose in publishing the essays on fictional literature in this  volume is in the hope of awakening a larger interest in America in  Italian letters and to aid in creating a demand for their translation  into English. I shall be glad if they serve to orient any one who is  bewildered by his first glance into the maze of Italian modern,  improvisional literature.    Americans go to Italy by the thousands, but very few of them take the  trouble to acquaint themselves with her history or with her ideals and  accomplishments. This is to be regretted, for proportionately as they  did that their pleasure would be enhanced and their profit increased.  Moreover, it would contribute to better mutual understanding of  Americans and Italians.    The remaining chapters are the outgrowth of experiences and emotions in  Italy during and after the war.    Some of these essays originally appeared in _The Bookman_, _Scribner's  Magazine_, and _The North American Review_, and I thank the editors of  those journals for permission to make use of them.

For them Italy is the cradle of modern  civilization and of the Christian religion; the land where modern  literature and science took their faltering first steps; the garden  where the flowers of art first bloomed, then reached a magnificence that  has never been equalled; the land that after having so long agonized  under the tyrant finally rose in its might and delivered her children,  carrying the principles of personal liberty to a new and noble  elevation.    We have an admiration and affection for her that one has for a beautiful  mother whose charm and redolency of accomplishment has increased with  time.    In recent days there have been countless numbers on this western  continent who feel that Italy has not had recognition from the world of  her decision, her valor, and her accomplishment in shaping the World War  to a successful end. Their interest in her has been quickened and their  pride enhanced. They look forward with confidence to the time when she  will again have a measure of that supremacy in the field of art and  literature which once made her the cynosure of all eyes, the loadstone  of all hearts. They hope to see her on a pedestal of political, social,  and religious liberty worthy of the dreams of Mazzini, which shall be  exposed to the admiring gaze of the whole world.    Already there are indications that she is making great strides in  literature and a generation of young writers is forging ahead, heralding  the coming of a new order.    It can scarcely be expected that Italy will achieve the position she had  in the sixteenth century when Ariosto and Tasso, Machiavelli and  Guicciardini, Bandello and Aretino, Cellini and Castiglione gave to  literature an unrivalled supremacy. But it may be legitimately hoped  that Italy will give up the servile admiration and imitation of foreign  literature, and particularly of the French, which has been so evident  during the past one hundred years, and at the same time while taking  pride in her cinquecento accomplishments, even in the glories of her  romantic period, realize that the vista which appeals to the children of  men to-day is that obtained from looking forward and not backward.    I shall take a cursory glance over the literature of the nineteenth  century preparatory to a survey of that of the twentieth, and note some  trends and their significance: the dislocation of habitual ways of  looking at things, of modes of thought, and of peeps into the future  caused by the French Revolution; the outlook for the Italian people  which seemed to be conditioned by the Napoleonic occupation; the  imminence of a change in the way in which the world was likely to be  ordered and administered suggested by the fall of thrones and  governments. Such events could not fail to be reflected in the  literature, particularly in imaginative literature as parallel  conditions to-day are being reflected in literature, practically all of  which is burdened with one topic: destruction of privilege and  liberation from archaic convention that freedom and liberty shall have a  larger significance--in brief, making a new estimate of human rights.  With the powerful political and religious reaction that was manifest in  all Europe after the French Revolution there developed a kind of  contempt, indeed abhorrence, of antique art and literature because it  was pagan and republican. The deeds of men, their longings, their  aspirations, their loves, their hatreds, their melancholies; the  beauties of nature, their potencies to influence the emotional state of  man and particularly to contribute to his happiness; the liberation of  mankind from galling tyranny and the universal happiness that would flow  from further liberation were the themes of writers. These coupled with  neglect and disdain of the heroes of antiquity, mythological and actual,  caused a romantic literature which moved over Europe like an avalanche.    Italy contested every inch of the threatened encroachment upon its soil,  and one of her poets, Vittorio Alfieri (1749-1803), who was most potent  in resisting it, stood out to the end for the classic ideal. The period  of his greatest mental activity and creativeness antedated the French  Revolution, and although he was in Paris when it was at its height, its  significance in so far as it is reflected in his writings was lost upon  him. The same is true of Giuseppe Parini (1729-1799), who, during the  last fifty years of the eighteenth century, had great vogue in Italy  because of a poem called \"Il Giorno\" (\"The Day\"), in which \"The  Morning,\" \"The Noon,\" \"The Evening,\" and \"The Night\" of a Lombard  gentleman was depicted to life and satirized.    The writings of Ugo Foscolo (1776-1827), which were given far higher  rating by contemporaries than by posterity, foreshadowed the yielding of  the classic traditions. But it was not until Cesarotti published a  translation of MacPherson's \"Ossian\" that the floodgates of romance were  opened for Italian literature. It was published at Padua (1763-1770).  From that date imaginative and lyric literature of Italy began to devote  itself to celebrating Italy's glorious past, to anticipating its future  glories, to recounting and satirizing contemporaries, to pillorying the  crimes of the tyrants who had fastened themselves upon Italy, and to  exposing the corruptions of its governments.    Its promoters were obsessed with the idea that they must get away from  the classic traditions. They sought to avoid the stern realities of  life, its sufferings and its tragedies, and instead to depict beauty,  pleasure, and happiness. They exalted the comedy and suppressed the  tragedy of daily life.    It has often been said that Italian romantic literature had its origin  in the Societa del Caffe founded in Milan in 1746. But like many"]]]
