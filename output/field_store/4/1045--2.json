WASHINGTON, D.C. 1966          _Publications of the United States National Museum_      The scholarly and scientific publications of the United States National  Museum include two series, _Proceedings of the United States National  Museum_ and _United States National Museum Bulletin_.    In these series, the Museum publishes original articles and monographs  dealing with the collections and work of its constituent museums--The  Museum of Natural History and the Museum of History and  Technology--setting forth newly acquired facts in the fields of  anthropology, biology, history, geology, and technology. Copies of each  publication are distributed to libraries, to cultural and scientific  organizations, and to specialists and others interested in the different  subjects.    The _Proceedings_, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in  separate form, of shorter papers from the Museum of Natural History.  These are gathered in volumes, octavo in size, with the publication date  of each paper recorded in the table of contents of the volume.    In the _Bulletin_ series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appear  longer, separate publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in  several parts) and volumes in which are collected works on related  subjects. _Bulletins_ are either octavo or quarto in size, depending on  the needs of the presentation. Since 1902 papers relating to the  botanical collections of the Museum of Natural History have been  published in the _Bulletin_ series under the heading _Contributions from  the United States National Herbarium_, and since 1959, in _Bulletins_  titled \"Contributions from the Museum of History and Technology,\" have  been gathered shorter papers relating to the collections and research of  that Museum.    The present collection of Contributions, Papers 34-44, comprises  Bulletin 240. Each of these papers has been previously published in  separate form. The year of publication is shown on the last page of each  paper.      FRANK A. TAYLOR    _Director, United States National Museum_          CONTRIBUTIONS FROM  THE MUSEUM OF HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY:  PAPER 37    SCREW-THREAD CUTTING BY THE  MASTER-SCREW METHOD SINCE 1480    _Edwin A. Battison_          _Edwin A. Battison_    SCREW-THREAD CUTTING BY THE MASTER-SCREW METHOD SINCE 1480        _Among the earliest known examples of screw-thread cutting machines      are the screw-cutting lathe of 1483, known only in pictures and      drawings, and an instrument of the traverse-spindle variety for      threading metal, now in the Smithsonian Institution, dating from the      late 17th or early 18th century. The author shows clearly their      evolution from something quite specialized to the present-day tool.      He has traced the patents for these instruments through the early      1930's and from this research we see the part played by such devices      in the development of the machine-tool industry._        THE AUTHOR: _Edwin A. Battison is associate curator of mechanical      and civil engineering in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of      History and Technology._      Directness and simplicity characterize pioneer machine tools because  they were intended to accomplish some quite specialized task and the  need for versatility was not apparent. History does not reveal the  earliest forms of any primitive machines nor does it reveal much about  the various early stages in evolution toward more complex types. At best  we have discovered and dated certain developments as existing in  particular areas. Whether these forms were new at the time they were  first found or how widely dispersed such forms may have been is unknown.  Surviving evidence is in the form of pictures or drawings, such as the  little-known screw-cutting lathe of 1483 (fig. 1) shown in _Das  mittelalterliche Hausbuch_.    This lathe shows that its builder had a keen perception of the necessary  elements, reduced to bare essentials, required to accomplish the object.  Present are the coordinate slides often credited to Henry Maudslay. His  slides are not, of course, associated with the spindle; neither is there  any natural law which compels them to guide the tool exactly parallel  with the axis of revolution. In this sense the screw-cutting lathe in  the _Hausbuch_ is superior because it is in harmony with natural law and  can generate a true cylinder, whereas Maudslay's lathe can only transfer  to the work whatever accuracy is built into it.    In principle this machine shown in the _Hausbuch_ is very advanced as we  see when we follow the design through to the present time. The artist,  whose drawings give us our only knowledge of the machine, himself was  obviously not very familiar with the details of its function. Reference  to figure 1 shows that the threads on the lead screw and on the work,  wind in opposite directions. This must be an error in delineation since  the two are closely coupled together without any intervening mechanism  so that the only possible result on the work must be a thread winding in  the same direction as on the original screw. The work also is shown  threaded for its entire length; this cannot be accomplished with any one  location of the cross-slide. We are left with the question of whether  this slide was used in two locations or whether the artist, possibly  working from notes or an earlier rough sketch, failed to show an  unthreaded portion on one end or the other of the work.    [Illustration: Figure 1.--EARLIEST REPRESENTATION FOUND OF A  MASTER-SCREW TYPE of thread-cutting machine. From the inconsistencies,  such as right- and left-hand threads on master and work, it appears that  the artist had scant insight into actual function. From plate 62 of _Das  mittelalterliche Hausbuch, nach dem Originale im Besitze des Fuersten von  Waldburg-Wolfegg-Waldsee, im Auftrage des Deutschen Vereins fuer  Kunstwissenschaft, herausgegeben von Helmuth Th. Bossert und Willy F.  Storck_ (Leipzig: E. A. Seemann, 1912).]    Of at least equal importance with the lead screw and work and their  relationship to each other is the tool-support with its screw-adjusted  cross-slide (fig. 2). Just how this was attached to the frame of the  machine so that it placed the tool at a suitable radius is again a  questionable point. The very well-developed cutting tool is sharpened to  a thin, keen edge totally unsuited for cutting metal but ideal for use  on a softer, fibrous substance: undoubtedly wood, in this instance.  Unfortunately, the angle at which the artist chose to show us this  cutter is not a view from which it is possible to judge whether or not  the tool has been made to conform to the helix angle of the thread to be  cut. This cross-slide, in conjunction with the traversing work spindle,  gives us a machine having two coordinate slides yielding the same effect  as the slide rest usually attributed to Henry Maudslay at the end of the  18th century. Actually, an illustration of coordinate slides independent  of the spindle had been published as early as 1569 by Besson[1] and  knowledge of them widely disseminated by his popular work on mechanics.  These slides are shown as part of a screw-cutting machine with a  questionably adequate connection, by means of cords, between the master  screw and the work.    It was the author's pleasure recently to obtain for the Smithsonian  Institution and identify a small, nicely made, brass instrument which  had been in two collections in this country and one collection in  Germany as an unidentified locksmith's tool (fig. 3). This proved to be  an instrument of the traverse-spindle variety for threading metal.  Fortunately, all essential details were present including a cutter (A in  figure 4); this instrument was identified by the signature \"Manuel  Wetschgi, Augspurg.\" The Wetschgis were a well-known family of gunsmiths  and mechanics in Augsburg through several generations. Two bore the  given name Emanuel: the earlier was born in 1678 and died in 1728. He  was quite celebrated in his field of rifle making and became chief of  artillery to the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel shortly before his death in  his 51st year. Little is known of the later Emanuel Wetschgi except that  he was at Augsburg in 1740. Tentative attribution of the instrument has  been made to the earlier Emanuel, chiefly on the basis of his recognized  position as an outstanding craftsman.    [Illustration: Figure 2.--CROSS-SLIDE for the thread-cutting lathe of  _Das mittelalterliche Hausbuch_, shown in figure 1. It is remarkable not  only for its early date, but also for its high state of development with  a crossfeed screw which had not become universally accepted 300 years  later. The cutter, shown out of its socket, is obviously sharpened for  use on wood.]    In several respects this little machine differs from its predecessor of  the _Hausbuch_, as might be expected when allowance is made for the  generations of craftsmen who undoubtedly worked with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31799"],[0,"Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

In them a problem of the first magnitude is formulated with apparent  simplicity, without giving the key to its final solution; for the  problem cannot be solved for generations--if at all.    But it involves an innumerable series of lesser problems, which I  present to the consideration of those whom they may concern. For it is a  long time since any one has devoted himself to earnest musical research.    It is true, that admirable works of genius arise in every period, and I  have always taken my stand in the front rank of those who joyfully  acclaimed the passing standard-bearers; and still it seems to me that of  all these beautiful paths leading so far afield--none lead _upward_.    _The spirit of an art-work, the measure of emotion, of humanity, that is  in it--these remain unchanged in value through changing years; the form  which these three assumed, the manner of their expression, and the  flavor of the epoch which gave them birth, are transient, and age  rapidly._    Spirit and emotion retain their essence, in the art-work as in man  himself; we admire technical achievements, yet they are outstripped, or  cloy the taste and are discarded.    Its ephemeral qualities give a work the stamp of \"modernity;\" its  unchangeable essence hinders it from becoming \"obsolete.\" Among both  \"modern\" and \"old\" works we find good and bad, genuine and spurious.  There is nothing properly modern--only things which have come into being  earlier or later; longer in bloom, or sooner withered. The Modern and  the Old have always been.    Art-forms are the more lasting, the more closely they adhere to the  nature of their individual species of art, the purer they keep their  essential means and ends.    Sculpture relinquishes the expression of the human pupil, and effects of  color; painting degenerates, when it forsakes the flat surface in  depiction and takes on complexity in theatrical decoration or panoramic  portrayal.    Architecture has its fundamental form, growth from below upward,  prescribed by static necessity; window and roof necessarily provide the  intermediate and finishing configuration; these are eternal and  inviolable requirements of the art.    Poetry commands the abstract thought, which it clothes in words. More  independent than the others, it reaches the furthest bounds.    _But all arts, resources and forms ever aim at the one end, namely, the  imitation of nature and the interpretation of human feelings._                               *       *       *    Architecture, sculpture, poetry and painting are old and mature arts;  their conceptions are established and their objects assured; they have  found the way through uncounted centuries, and, like the planets,  describe their regular orbits.[A]      [A] None the less, in these arts, taste and individuality can and will    unceasingly find refreshment and rejuvenation.    Music, compared with them, is a child that has learned to walk, but must  still be led. It is a virgin art, without experience in life and  suffering.    It is all unconscious as yet of what garb is becoming, of its own  advantages, its unawakened capacities. And again, it is a child-marvel  that is already able to dispense much of beauty, that has already  brought joy to many, and whose gifts are commonly held to have attained  full maturity.                               *       *       *    Music as an art, our so-called occidental music, is hardly four hundred  years old; its state is one of development, perhaps the very first  stage of a development beyond present conception, and we--we talk of  \"classics\" and \"hallowed traditions\"! And we have talked of them for a  long time![B]      [B] Tradition is a plaster mask taken from life, which, in the course    of many years, and after passing through the hands of innumerable    artisans, leaves its resemblance to the original largely a matter of    imagination.    We have formulated rules, stated principles, laid down laws;--we apply  laws made for maturity to a child that knows nothing of responsibility!                               *       *       *    Young as it is, this child, we already recognize that it possesses one  radiant attribute which signalizes it beyond all its elder sisters. And  the lawgivers will not see this marvelous attribute, lest their laws  should be thrown to the winds. This child--it _floats on air_! It  touches not the earth with its feet. It knows no law of gravitation. It  is wellnigh incorporeal. Its material is transparent. It is sonorous  air. It is almost Nature herself. It is--free.                               *       *       *    But freedom is something that mankind have never wholly comprehended,  never realized to the full. They can neither recognize nor acknowledge  it.    They disavow the mission of this child; they hang weights upon it. This  buoyant creature must walk decently, like anybody else. It may scarcely  be allowed to leap--when it were its joy to follow the line of the  rainbow, and to break sunbeams with the clouds.                               *       *       *    Music was born free; and to win freedom is its destiny. It will become  the most complete of all reflexes of Nature by reason of its untrammeled  immateriality. Even the poetic word ranks lower in point of  incorporealness. It can gather together and disperse, can be motionless  repose or wildest tempestuosity; it has the extremest heights  perceptible to man--what other art has these?--and its emotion seizes  the human heart with that intensity which is independent of the \"idea.\"    It realizes a temperament, _without_ describing it, with the mobility of  the soul, with the swiftness of consecutive moments; and this, where  painter or sculptor can represent only one side or one moment, and the  poet tardily _communicates_ a temperament and its manifestations by  words.    Therefore, representation and description are not the nature of music;  herewith we declare the invalidity of program-music, and arrive at the  question: What are the aims of music?                               *       *       *    ABSOLUTE Music! What the lawgivers mean by this, is perhaps remotest of  all from the Absolute in music. \"Absolute music\" is a form-play without  poetic program, in which the form is intended to have the leading part.  But Form, in itself, is the opposite pole of absolute music, on which  was bestowed the divine prerogative of buoyancy, of freedom from the  limitations of matter. In a picture, the illustration of a sunset ends  with the frame; the limitless natural phenomenon is enclosed in  quadrilateral bounds; the cloud-form chosen for depiction remains  unchanging for ever. Music can grow brighter or darker, shift hither or  yon, and finally fade away like the sunset glow itself; and instinct  leads the creative musician to employ the tones that press the same key  within the human breast, and awaken the same response, as the processes  in Nature.    Per contra, \"absolute music\" is something very sober, which reminds one  of music-desks in orderly rows, of the relation of Tonic to Dominant, of  Developments and Codas.    Methinks I hear the second violin struggling, a fourth below, to emulate  the more dexterous first, and contending in needless contest merely to  arrive at the starting-point. This sort of music ought rather to be  called the \"architectonic,\" or \"symmetric,\" or \"sectional,\" and derives  from the circumstance that certain composers poured _their_ spirit and  _their_ emotion into just this mould as lying nearest them or their  time. Our lawgivers have identified the spirit and emotion, the  individuality of these composers and their time, with \"symmetric\"  music, and finally, being powerless to recreate either the spirit, or  the emotion, or the time, have retained the Form as a symbol, and made  it into a fetish, a religion. The composers sought and found this form  as the aptest vehicle for communicating _their_ ideas; their souls took  flight--and the lawgivers discover and cherish the garments Euphorion  left behind on earth.        A lucky find! 'Twas now or never;      The flame is gone, it's true--however,        No need to pity mankind now.      Enough is left for many a poet's tiring,        Or to breed envy high and low;      And though I have no talents here for hiring,        I'll hire the robe out, anyhow.    Is it not singular, to demand of a composer originality in all things,  and to"]]]
