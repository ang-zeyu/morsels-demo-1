The account of the alleged voyage of Amerigo Vespucci in 1497-98 was  written for that worthy's own countrymen, and for foreigners who lived at  a distance from the Peninsula. When, after some years, the story reached  Spain in print, men were still alive who would have known whether any such  voyage had ever been made. Among them was the able and impartial historian  Las Casas, who considered that the story was false, and disproved it from  internal evidence. The authority of Las Casas is alone conclusive. Modern  investigators, such as Robertson, Munoz, Navarrete, Humboldt, Washington  Irving, and D'Avezac examined the question, and they all came to the same  conclusion as Las Casas.    The matter appeared to be finally settled until 1865. In that year M.  F. de Varnhagen, Baron of Porto Seguro in Brazil, published a book at  Lima,[1] where he was accredited as Brazilian Minister, with the object of  rehabilitating the Florentine's character for honesty, by arguing that the  story of the alleged voyage in 1497-98 was worthy of credit. This makes it  desirable that the whole question should once more be discussed. Varnhagen  at least deserves the thanks of all students of the history of American  discovery for having published, in an accessible form, both the Latin  and the Italian texts of the letters of Vespucci.    It has been decided by the Council of the Hakluyt Society to supply a  volume to the members containing translations of the letters of Vespucci,  of the chapters in which they are discussed in the history of Las Casas,  and other original documents relating to the subject. Readers will thus be  enabled to form independent judgments on this vexed question; while the  Introduction will furnish them with the events of the life of Vespucci,  and with a review of the arguments in support of Varnhagen's theory,  as well as of those which militate against it.    A Life of Vespucci was published by an enthusiastic fellow-countryman  named Bandini, in 1745,[2] who collected all there is to be known  respecting his family and early life at Florence, and reprinted his  authentic letters. Canovai was another biographer, and a still warmer  panegyrist.[3]    There are three spurious letters attributed to Vespucci, but they are  now so universally held to be forgeries, that they need not occupy our  time.[4]    We learn from Bandini that Amerigo was the third son of a notary at  Florence, named Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci, by Lisabetta Mini, and  that he was born on March 9th, 1451.[5] He was thus four years younger  than Columbus. Amerigo studied under his uncle, Fra Giorgio Antonio  Vespucci, a Dominican monk of St. Marco, at Florence, who taught him  Latin. A letter from Amerigo to his father, in Latin, has been preserved,  dated on October 18th, 1476, at Mugello, near Trebbio, whither he had  been sent in consequence of an epidemic then raging at Florence. In the  same year the elder brother, Antonio, was sent to the University of  Pisa. He was a scholar and an author. His eldest son, Bartolomeo, rose  to be Professor of Astrology at Pisa, and left a son. His second son,  Giovanni, eventually joined his uncle Amerigo in Spain, and became a  pilot. The other brother, Geronimo, went as a merchant to Syria, where  he lost all he had made after nine years of labour. This is stated in  a letter to Amerigo, dated July 24th, 1489, which was brought to Italy  by a priest named Carnesecchi, who was returning.    Amerigo Vespucci embraced a mercantile life at Florence,[6] and was  eventually taken into the great commercial house of the Medici, the head  of which was Lorenzo Piero Francesco di Medici, who succeeded his father,  Lorenzo the Magnificent, in 1492. The house had transactions in Spain,  and required experienced agents at Cadiz. Amerigo, who was then over  forty years of age, and Donato Niccolini were selected for this duty,  and took up their residence at Cadiz and Seville in 1492. In December  1495, an Italian merchant, named Juanoto Berardi, died at Seville, and  Vespucci was employed to wind up his affairs. This Berardi had contracted,  on April 9th, 1495, to supply the Government with twelve vessels of 900  tons each for the Indies.[7] He handed over the first four in the same  April, four more in June, and the rest in September, but unluckily the  four last were wrecked before delivery.[8] On the 10th of April 1495,  the Spanish Government broke faith with Columbus, and contrary to the  concession made to him, free navigation was allowed to the Indies,  on condition that the ships sailed from Cadiz, and were registered  as submitting to certain engagements as regards the State. Gomara,  an unreliable authority, alleges that many vessels took advantage of  this concession. It is likely enough that some were sent on commercial  ventures, but it is grossly improbable that any discoveries of importance  were made and left entirely unrecorded. The Admiral remonstrated against  the infraction of his rights, and the order of April 10th, 1495, was  cancelled on June 2nd, 1497.    During this period Vespucci was engaged at Cadiz as a provision  contractor. A record is preserved of his having received 10,000 maravedis  from Treasurer Pinelo on January 12th, 1496, for payment of sailors'  wages; and we learn from Munoz that other entries[9] prove that Vespucci  continued his business of provision merchant at least until May 1498. He  contracted for one, if not for two, of the expeditions of Columbus. A  very civil and plausible man was this beef contractor, and the Admiral  spoke of him, seven years afterwards, as being very respectable (_hombre  muy de bien_).    In 1499, the very respectable contractor, who was approaching the age of  fifty, determined to retire from business and go to sea. His own reasons  for this complete change in his old age were that he had already seen  and known various changes of fortune in business; that a man might at  one time be at the top of the well and at another be fallen and subject  to losses; and that it had become evident to him that a merchant's life  was one of continual labour, with the chance of failure and ruin. It  was rather late in life to make these discoveries, and it may fairly  be suspected that there was some more concrete reason for his change of  life which he concealed under these generalities.    The expedition in which Vespucci sailed was organised and fitted out  by Alonzo de Hojeda in 1499."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

In the ultimate success there is glory enough    To go to the graves of the dead and to the heads of the living.          THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE POLAR CONTROVERSY      DR. COOK IS VINDICATED. HIS DISCOVERY OF THE NORTH POLE IS ENDORSED BY  THE EXPLORERS OF ALL THE WORLD.    In placing Dr. Cook on the Chautauqua platform as a lecturer, we have  been compelled to study the statements issued for and against the rival  polar claims with special reference to the facts bearing upon the  present status of the Polar Controversy.    Though the question has been argued during four years, we find that it  is almost the unanimous opinion of arctic explorers today, that Dr. Cook  reached the North Pole on April 21, 1909.    With officer Peary's first announcement he chose to force a press  campaign to deny Dr. Cook's success and to proclaim himself as the sole  Polar Victor. Peary aimed to be retired as a Rear-Admiral on a pension  of $6,000 per year. This ambition was granted; but the American Congress  rejected his claim for priority by eliminating from the pension bill the  words \"Discovery of the Pole.\" The European geographical societies,  forced under diplomatic pressure to honor Peary, have also refused him  the title of \"Discoverer.\" By a final verdict of the American government  and of the highest European authorities, Peary is therefore denied the  assumption of being the discoverer of the Pole, though his claim as a  re-discoverer is allowed. The evasive inscriptions on the Peary medals  prove this statement.    Following the acute excitement of the first announcement, it seemed to  be desirable to bring the question to a focus by submitting to some  authoritative body for decision. Such an institution, however, did not  exist. Previously, explorers had been rated by the slow process of  historic digestion and assimilation of the facts offered, but it was  thought that an academic examination would meet the demands. Officer  Peary first submitted his case to a commission appointed by the National  Geographical Society of Washington, D. C. This jury promptly said that  in their \"opinion\" Peary reached the Pole on April 6, 1909; but a year  later in congress the same men unwillingly admitted that in the Peary  proofs there was no positive proof.    Dr. Cook's data was sent to a commission appointed by the University of  Copenhagen. The Danes reported that the material presented was  incomplete and did not constitute positive proof. This verdict, however,  did not carry the interpretation that the Pole had not been reached. The  Danes have never said, as they have been quoted by the press, that Dr.  Cook did not reach the Pole; quite to the contrary, the University of  Copenhagen conferred the degree of Ph. D. and the Royal Danish  Geographical Society gave a gold medal, both in recognition of the  merits of the Polar effort.    This early examination was based mostly upon the nautical calculations  for position, and both verdicts when analyzed gave the version that in  such observations there was no positive proof. The Washington jury  ventured an opinion. The Danes refused to give an opinion, but showed  their belief in Dr. Cook's success by conferring honorary degrees.    It is the unfair interpretation of the respective verdicts by the  newspapers which has precipitated the turbulent air of distrust which  previously rested over the entire Polar achievement. All this, however,  has now been cleared by the final word of fifty of the foremost Polar  explorers and scientific experts.    In so far as they were able to judge from all the data presented in the  final books of both claimants the following experts have given it as  their opinion that Dr. Cook reached the Pole, and that officer Peary's  similar report coming later is supplementary proof of the first victory:    General A. W. Greely, U. S. A., commander of the Lady Franklin Bay  Expedition, who spent four years in the region under discussion.    Rear Admiral W. S. Schley, U. S. N., commander of the Greely Relief  Expedition.    Capt. Otto Sverdrup, discoverer of the land over which Dr. Cook's route  was forced.    Capt. J. E. Bernier, commanding the Canadian Arctic Expeditions.    Prof. G. Frederick Wright, author of the \"Ice Age of North America.\"    Capt. E. B. Baldwin, commanding the Baldwin-Ziegler Expedition.    Prof. W. H. Brewer for 16 years president of the Arctic Club of America.    Prof. Julius Payer of the Weyprecht-Payer Expedition.    Prof. L. L. Dyche, member of various Peary and Cook Expeditions.    Mr. Maurice Connell, Greely Expedition, and U. S. Weather Bureau.    Capt. O. C. Hamlet, U. S. A. Arctic Revenue Service.    Capt. E. A. Haven, Baldwin-Ziegler Expedition.    Mr. Andrew J. Stone, Explorer of North Coast of America.    Mr. Dillon Wallace, Labrador Explorer.    Mr. Edwin Swift Balch, author of \"The North Pole and Bradley Land.\"    Captains Johan Menander, B. S. Osbon and Thomas F. Hall.    Messrs. Henry Biederbeck, Frederick B. Wright, F. F. Taylor, Ralph H.  Cairns, Theodore Lerner, M. Van Ryssellberghe, J. Knowles Hare, Chas. E.  Rilliet, Homer Rogers, R. C. Bates, E. C. Rost, L. C. Bement, Clarence  Wychoff, Alfred Church, Archibald Dickinson, Robert Stein, J. S.  Warmbath, Geo. B. Butland, Ralph Shainwald, Henry Johnson, S. J.  Entrikin, Clark Brown, W. F. Armbruster, John R. Bradley, Harry Whitney  and Rudolph Franke.    Drs. T. F. Dedrick, Middleton Smith, J. G. Knowlton, H. J. Egbert, W. H.  Axtell, A. H. Cordier and Henry Schwartz.    Judge Jules Leclercq, and Prof. Georges Lecointe, Secretary of the  International Bureau of Polar Research.    Thus endorsed by practically all Polar Explorers, Dr. Cook's attainment  of the Pole and his earlier work of discovery and exploration is farther  established by the following honorary pledges of recognition. (These are  now in the possession of Dr. Cook, the press reports to the contrary  being untrue).    By the King of Belgium, decorated as Knight of the Order of Leopold.    By the University of Copenhagen in conferring the degree of Ph. D.    By the Royal Danish Geographical Society, presentation of a gold medal.    By the Arctic Club of America, presentation of a gold medal.    By the Royal Geographical Society of Belgium, presentation of a gold  medal.    By the Municipality of the City of Brussels, presentation of a gold  medal.    By the Municipality of the City of New York, with the ceremony of  presenting the keys and offering the freedom of the city.    Without denying officer Peary's success, we note that his case rests  upon the opinion of three of his official associates in Washington.  Three men acting for a society financially interested--three men who  have never seen a piece of Polar ice--have given it as their \"opinion\"  that Mr. Peary (a year later than Dr. Cook) reached the Pole. By many  this was accepted as a final verdict of experts for Peary. But are such  men dependable experts?    Dr. Cook now offers in substantiation of his work the support and the  final verdict of fifty of the foremost explorers and scientific experts.  Each in his own way has during the past four years examined the polar  problem and pronounced in favor of Dr. Cook.    He is therefore vindicated of the propaganda of insinuation and distrust  which his enemies forced, and his success in reaching the Pole is  conceded and endorsed by his own peers.    In his book, \"My Attainment of the Pole,\" Dr. Cook offers with thrilling  vividness a most remarkable series of adventures in the enraptured  wilderness at the top of the globe. And in his lectures he takes his  audience step by step over the haunts of northernmost man and beyond to  the sparkling sea of death at the pole. Above all he leaves in the  hearts of his listeners the thrills of a fresh vigor and a new  inspiration, which opens the way for other worlds to conquer. By his  books and by his lectures, Dr. Cook seeks justice at the bar of public  opinion, and three million people have applauded his effort on the  platform. One hundred thousand people will read his book during the  coming year. We are inclined to agree with Capt. E. B. Baldwin and other  Arctic explorers who say--\"Putting aside the academic and idle argument  of pin-point accuracy, the North Pole has been"]]]
