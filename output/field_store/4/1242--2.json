(The author's real  name is unknown.) This edition has been proof-read word-by-word  against a copy of the original on microfiche. (Canadian Institute  for Historical Microreproductions no. 00529)    In this text, a mixture of American and British spelling can be  found. (For example \"harbour\" and \"favor\" are both used.) The  phrase \"rocket-car\" is hyphenated twice, while appearing three  times as two individual words. There are also some instances of  unusual spelling and capitalization of words. With the exception  of a few small emendations, spelling, capitalization and  punctuation have been preserved as in the original.          THE DOMINION IN 1983    by Ralph Centennius        Entered according to Act of Parliament of Canada, in the  year 1883, by Toker & Co., Publisher on behalf of the Author,  in the Office of the Minister of Agriculture.        I.        \"Before the curing of a strong disease,    \"Even in the instant of repair and health,    \"The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,    \"On their departure most of all show evil.\"                        --King John, Act III.      In the present advanced and happy times it is instructive to take  a retrospective glance at the days of our forefathers of the  nineteenth century, and to meditate upon the political struggles  and events of the past hundred years, that by so doing we may gain  a clear insight into the causes which have led to the present  wonderful developments. We, in the year of Grace 1983, are too  apt to take for granted all the blessings of moral, political  and physical science which we enjoy, and to pass over without  due consideration the great efforts of our ancestors, which have  made our present happy condition possible.    Let us try to contrast the Dominion of to-day with the Dominion of  1883. To begin with population. Our population at the last census  in 1981, was just over 93,000,000. A hundred years ago a scant  5,000,000 represented this great Canadian nation, which has since  so mightily increased and proved itself such a beneficent factor  in human affairs. Seven provinces and some sparsely peopled and  only partially explored territories formed all that the world then  knew as Canada. To-day have we not fifteen provinces for the most  part thickly peopled, and long since fully explored to the shores  of the Arctic Ocean?    In the present days of political serenity it is hard to realize  the animosity and extreme bitterness of the past century. The two  parties into which men formerly divided themselves, viewed each  other as enemies, and each party opposed on principle whatever  measures the other proposed. From a careful study of the principal  journals of the time, fyled at Ottawa, we gather that the party,  self-styled \"Reformers,\" frequently opposed progressive measures,  and even attempted to hinder the construction of railroads, while  the other party called \"Conservatives\" considered railroads as the  best means of opening up the enormous tracts of country then lying  untrodden by man, and useless to civilization. Such are certainly  the inferences to be drawn from the records at our command, though  it is hard to believe in opposition to railroads or to advancement  in any form in these days, when new channels of communication and  new industries are viewed with favor by the whole nation. Each  party seems strangely to have belied its title, for the Reformers,  after the confederation of the provinces in 1867, endeavored with  singular perverseness to frustrate or retard reform and improvement  of all kinds, while the Conservatives did not desire to preserve  things in the old ruts and grooves, but strove hard for beneficial  advancement of every sort.    In 1883 the United States was one of the leading nations of the  world. With a population of over 50,000,000, and an almost  illimitable extent of territory still open for settlement by the  fugitives from troubled Europe; with exhaustless wealth, developed  and undeveloped, it seemed reasonable to suppose that a nation so  placed should be able to attain the foremost position and be able to  keep it. Such appears to have been the opinion of most foreigners,  and also of some of our Canadians of the period, for the wealth,  apparent power and prestige of the United States caused many of our  weak-kneed ancestors to lose heart in their own country, and in fits  of disloyal dejection to fancy there could be no progress except in  union with the States. Stout hearts, however, ultimately gained the  day, and we in the twentieth century are reaping the benefits won  for the country by the valor of our great-grandfathers.    The troubled times through which the youthful Dominion passed from  1885 to 1888 constitute one of the greatest crises through which  any nation ever passed successfully. Canada, with her confederated  provinces and large territories loosely held together, with her  scattered population chiefly grouped in Ontario and Quebec, with  her infant manufactures and scarcely-touched mineral resources,  was the home, nevertheless, of as prosperous and promising a young  nation as the world ever saw; and had it not been for the timid  portion of her population just mentioned, a great deal of trouble  might have been saved. But out of evil came good. The Americans for  years had been too careless about receiving upon their shores all  the firebrands and irreconcileables from European cities, and the  consequence was that these undesirable gentry increased in numbers,  and the infection of their opinions spread. American politics were  as corrupt as they could be. Bribery and the robbery of public funds  were unblushingly resorted to. A low moral tone with regard to such  matters, combined with utter recklessness in speculation and a  furious haste to get rich by any means, fair or foul, were, sad to  say, prominent characteristics in the American nation in many other  respects so great. To counteract these evils, which were great  enough to have ruined any European state in a couple of years, there  was, however, the marvellous prodigality of nature--a bounteousness  and richness in the yield of the soil and the depths of the earth  hardly equalled in any other part of the world, and in consequence  princely fortunes were accumulated in an incredibly short space of  time. Millionaires abounded, and monopolists, compared with whom  Croesus was poor, flourished. But bitter poverty and starvation also  flourished, especially in the large cities, bringing in their train  the usual discontent and hatred of the established order of things.  Yet these old-fashioned evils were scarcely noticed in the general  magnificent prosperity of the country. The short-sighted statesmen  of the time delighted to look only on the bright side of things,  and to them the very exuberance of the prosperity seemed to condone,  if not to justify, the nefarious practices which obtained in high  places. No wonder that among our Canadians, hardly 5,000,000 all  told, there were some who were weak enough to be dazzled at the  wealth and success of their brilliant go-ahead neighbours, more than  50,000,000 strong. Among those who lost heart in Canada, it began  to be a settled conviction that it was \"the destiny of Canada to be  absorbed in the States.\"    This was the state of things in 1885. Conservative statesmen pointed  to the general progress of our country, to unprecedented immigration  from Europe, increased agricultural products and manufactures, and  to many other convincing proofs of solid advancement. But facts  were of no avail in dealing with Reformers habitually, and on  principle despondent. The sanguine buoyancy and plucky hopefulness  indispensable to true statesmanship did not animate them to any  extent. Unhappily events over which no statesman could then have  control overtook Canada, while as yet things bounded along gaily  in the States, and the sons of despair seemed to have some ground  for their pusillanimity. The harvest of 1885 was deficient, and  agriculture was in consequence depressed: a slight panic in the  Spring was succeeded by a great one in the Fall. Heavy failures  followed. A feeling of uneasiness was caused at the same time by  great social and political changes which were going on in the  mother country, and were threatening to assume the proportions of  a revolution. The unparalleled prosperity of the States caused the  Americans--never backward in blowing their own trumpet--to assume  an attitude of overweening confidence in themselves, and to brag  offensively of what they considered to be their duty to mankind,  namely, to convert all the world--by force if necessary--to  republican principles. Such was the commencement of the great crisis  in the history of the young Canadian nation--a crisis through which,  if our sturdy forefathers had not pulled successfully, would have  led to our gradual obliteration as a nation. All honor then to the  great men to whom, under Providence, our preservation is due!    In 1886 commenced the reign of terror in Europe, that terrible  period of mingled war and revolution, during which thrones were  hurled down and dynasties swept away like chaff in a gale. The  face of Europe was changed. Whole provinces were blackened and  devastated by fire and sword. During the three years in which  the terror was at its height it is calculated that at least four  millions of men bearing arms, the flower of each land, must have  fallen. Great Britain was frequently on the very brink of war, but  was almost miraculously kept from actually taking part. And most  providential it was that Britain was not drawn into the tumult,  for home troubles and defensive measures required all the attention  of the nation.

A MAID OF YAVAPAI.          CHAPTER I.    A FRAIL BARK, TOSSED ON LIFE'S TEMPESTUOUS SEAS      A native of Germany, I came to the United States soon after the Civil  War, a healthy, strong boy of fifteen years. My destination was a  village on the Rio Grande, in New Mexico, where I had relatives. I was  expected to arrive at Junction City, in the State of Kansas, on a day  of June, 1867, and proceed on my journey with a train of freight wagons  over the famous old Santa Fe trail.    Junction City was then the terminal point of a railway system which  extended its track westward across the great American plains, over the  virgin prairie, the native haunt of the buffalo and fleet-footed  antelope, the iron horse trespassing on the hunting ground of the  Arapahoe and Comanche Indian tribes. As a mercantile supply depot for  New Mexico and Colorado, Junction City was the port from whence a  numerous fleet of prairie schooners sailed, laden with the necessities  and luxuries of an advancing civilization. But not every sailor reached  his destined port, for many were they who were sent by the pirates of  the plains over unknown trails, to the shores of the great Beyond,  their scalpless bodies left on the prairie, a prey to vultures and  coyotes.    If the plans of my relatives had developed according to program, this  story would probably not have been told. Indians on the warpath  attacked the wagon train which I was presumed to have joined, a short  distance out from Junction City. They killed and scalped several  teamsters and also a young German traveler; stampeded and drove off a  number of mules and burned up several wagons. This was done while  fording the Arkansas River, near Fort Dodge. I was delayed near Kansas  City under circumstances which preclude the supposition of chance and  indicate a subtle and Inexorably fatal power at work for the  preservation of my life--a force which with the giant tread of the  earthquake devastates countries and lays cities in ruins; that awful  power which on wings of the cyclone slays the innocent babe in its  cradle and harms not the villain, or vice versa; that inscrutable  spirit which creates and lovingly shelters the sparrow over night and  then at dawn hands it to the owl to serve him for his breakfast. Safe I  was under the guidance of the same loving, paternal Providence which in  death delivereth the innocent babe from evil and temptation, shields  the little sparrow from all harm forever, and incidentally provides  thereby for the hungry owl.    I should have changed cars at Kansas City, but being asleep at the  critical time and overlooked by the conductor, I passed on to a station  beyond the Missouri River. There the conductor aroused me and put me  off the train without ceremony. I was forced to return, and reached the  river without any mishap, as it was a beautiful moonlight night. I  crossed the long bridge with anxiety, for it was a primitive-looking  structure, built on piles, and I had to step from tie to tie, looking  continually down at the swirling waters of the great, muddy river. As I  realized the possibility of meeting a train, I crossed over it,  running. At last I reached the opposite shore. It was nearly dawn now,  and I walked to the only house in sight, a long, low building of logs  and, being very tired, I sat down on the veranda and soon fell asleep.  It was not long after sunrise that a sinister, evil-looking person,  smelling vilely of rum, woke me up roughly and asked me what I did  there. When he learned that I was traveling to New Mexico and had lost  my way, he grew very polite and invited me into the house.    We entered a spacious hall, which served as a dining-room, where eight  young ladies were busily engaged arranging tables and furniture. The  man intimated that he kept a hotel and begged the young ladies to see  to my comfort and bade me consider myself as being at home. The girls  were surprised and delighted to meet me and overwhelmed me with  questions. They expressed the greatest concern and interest when they  learned that I was about to cross the plains.    \"Poor little Dutchy,\" said one, \"how could your mother send you out all  alone into the cruel, wide world!\" \"Mercy, and among the Indians, too,\"  said another. When I replied that my dear mother had sent me away  because she loved me truly, as she knew that I had a better chance to  prosper in the United States than in the Fatherland, they called me a  cute little chap and smothered me with their kisses.    The tallest and sweetest of these girls (her name was Rose) pulled my  ears teasingly and asked if her big, little man was not afraid of the  Indians. \"Not I, madame,\" I replied; \"for my father charged me to be  honest and loyal, brave and true, and fear not and prove myself a  worthy scion of the noble House of Von Siebeneich.\" \"Oh, my! Oh, my!\"  cried the young ladies, and \"Did you ever!\" and \"No, I never!\" and \"Who  would have thought it!\" Regarding me wide-eyed with astonishment, they  listened with bated breath as I explained that I was a lineal  descendant of the Knight Hartmann von Siebeneich, who achieved  everlasting fame through impersonating the Emperor Frederick  (Barbarossa) of Germany, in order to prevent his capture by the enemy.  I told how the commander of the Italian army, inspired with admiration  by the desperate valor of the loyal knight, released him and did honor  him greatly. And how this noble knight, my father's ancestor, followed  the Emperor Frederick to the Holy Land and fought the Saracens. \"And,\"  added I, \"my father's great book of heraldry contains the legend of the  curse which fell on our house through the villainy of the Imperial  Grand Chancellor of Blazonry, who was commanded to devise and procure a  brand new heraldic escutcheon for our family.    \"He blazoned our shield with the ominous motto, 'in der fix, Haben  nix,' over gules d'or on a stony field, which was sown to a harvest of  tares and oats, and embossed with a whirlwind rampant. As they were in  knightly honor bound to live up to the motto on their shield, my  ancestor were doomed to remain poor forever. At last they took service  with the free city of Hamburg, where they settled finally and became  honored citizens.\"    Happening to remember my mother's admonishment not to annoy people with  too much talk, I apologized to the young ladies. Smilingly, they begged  me to continue, for they seemed to enjoy my boyish prattle.    \"Listen, now, girls,\" said Rose laughingly to her companions, \"now, I  shall make him open his mother's closet and show us her choicest family  skeleton.\" \"Oh, no, Miss Rose,\" I protested, \"my mother has indeed a  great closet, but it is full of good things to eat and contains no  skeletons.\"  \"You little goosie-gander; you don't understand,\" replied  Miss Rose; \"I was only joking. Of course your mother kept the door  carefully locked to keep you boys from foraging?\" \"No madame,\" said I,  \"it was not necessary to lock the door.\" \"Did she keep a guard, then?\"  said Rose. \"Oh, yes,\" I replied, \"and it was very hard to pass in  without being knocked down.\" \"Was it a man?\" she asked mischievously.  \"Why, yes; mamma kept a strong, old Limburger right behind the door,\" I  said.    When the girls had ceased laughing, Rose said, \"What did your mother  tell you when you left for America?\" \"My mother,\" I answered, \"implored  me with tearful eyes to ever remember how my father's  great-great-grandmother Brunhilde (who was exceedingly beautiful) was  enticed into the depths of a dark forest by a wily, old German King.  Indiscreetly and unsuspectingly she followed him. There clandestinely  did he favor her graciously by adding a bar sinister to our knightly  escutcheon and a strain of the blood royal to our family. This happened  long, long ago in the dark ages or some other dark place--it may have  been the Schwarzwald--and it was the curse of the stony field that did  it.    \"'Oh, my son,' mother urged me, 'we count on you to restore the  unaccountably long-lost prestige of our ancient family. In America,  behind the counters of your uncle's counting-rooms, you shall acquire  great wealth, and his Majesty the Kaiser will be pleased to re-invest  you with the coronet of a count. Then, as a noble count will you be of  some account in the exclusive circle of the four hundred of the great  city of New York. Beautiful heiresses will crave the favor of your  acquaintance, and if wise, you will lead the most desirable one on the "]]]
