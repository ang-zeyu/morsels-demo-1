Bee Keeping for Profit        SOME MEMORIES OF BEE HUNTING    I was born in a little valley, hemmed in by mountains running north  and south on either side. It varies in width from one to three  miles from the foot of one range to the other. From my home I have  a clear view of these beautiful Mountains and, as these mountains  and lowlands teemed with game of all kind, and being heavily  timbered, made an ideal location for the home of the wild bee. From  early youth I loved to lure the wild turkey, stalk the deer and  line the bee to his home. Is it any wonder that after forty years  of undiminished passion for sports of this kind that I can  truthfully say there is scarcely a square rod of these mountains  that is not indelibly impressed on my mind in connection with some  of the above mentioned sports or pastimes? I will confine myself in  this work to the subject of Bee Hunting, believing it to be one of  the most fascinating and beneficial of pastimes.        PREFACE    In the preparation of this work, it has been my aim to instruct the  beginner in the art of bee hunting, rather than offer suggestions  to those who have served an apprenticeship at the fascinating  pastime. I do not wish to leave the impression that I think others  who have made this a study do not know enough on the subject to  give suggestions; far from it. But to be candid with each other, as  lovers of nature and her ways should be, even though we be veterans  in the business, by an exchange of ideas we can always learn  something new and of value. Many books on sports of various kinds  have been written, but outside of an occasional article in  periodicals devoted to bee literature, but little has been written  on the subject of bee hunting. Therefore, I have tried, in this  volume, Bee Hunting for Pleasure and Profit, to give a work in  compact form, the product of what I have learned along this line  during the forty years in nature's school room.    Brother, if in reading these pages you find something that will be  of value to you, something that will inculcate a desire for manly  pastime and make your life brighter, then my aim will have been  reached.    I am very truly yours,    JOHN R LOCKARD.        BEE HUNTING        CHAPTER I.    AN OLD BEE HUNTER.    The bee hunters in my early days used one of two methods in hunting  the bee. The hunter would select a clear day, generally during  buckwheat bloom, and after determining on a course, sun them to the  tree. This was done by placing the hat or hand between the eye and  sun as close to the light as the eye would permit. If the hunter  knew the difference between the flight of a loaded bee and an  unloaded one he would keep on the course until the tree was  located.    This method must undoubtedly be injurious to the eyes and I do not  follow this plan nor advise others to do so. The other method was  what was termed burning or baiting. A fire was built near where the  bee tree was supposed to be, large flat sand stones were placed on  the fire and heated. One of these was removed to some place clear  of trees and underbrush, some bee-comb, dampened with water, was  then placed on the stone, and when the fumes of the comb would go  off into the air any bees flying near were apt to be enticed to the  bait, which was sprinkled on a bunch of bushes and laid near the  stone. Many bees were found in this way, but if they went any great  distance two or more fires had to be built. This would require much  time and often the hunter, not being careful in extinguishing the  fire, the surrounding leaves would catch fire and a destructive  forest fire would result. Therefore it shall be my aim to eliminate  anything of an injurious or objectionable nature in the work I lay  before the reader.    On a calm morning in the early part of November, I went to the top  of the mountain west of my home. The day was an ideal one. The  trees had shed their leaves, making a thick carpet over the earth.  It seemed that all nature was getting ready for a long winter  sleep. All flowers except a few bunches of mountain goldenrod were  dead. The bees seemed to be aware that their labors were about  ended and were eagerly looking for anything in shape of sweets that  would add to their store of supplies and thus help to tide over the  long winter. After arriving at the top of the mountain I built a  fire, heated a large flat stone and took some bee comb and  proceeded to follow the example before mentioned. After watching  quite a long time and not seeing any bees I was on the point of  giving it up, at this place at least, when that sound so delightful  to the ear of the bee hunter, the silvery tone of the bee in  flight, came to my ear. Several times the sound was repeated but so  far I had not got a sight of it. On looking over the top of the  bushes I saw two bees flying slowly, sometimes coming near the  bait, then darting away, then returning and finally settling down  on the bait. All was anxiety! I must be sure to see these two bees  take their homeward flight. In a very short time one of them slowly  raised from the bait, circled a time or two, and then darted away  so quickly that I knew not where. Now the other one won't escape me  so easily. But when I turned to look, she, too, was gone. In a  short time they were back and lots of others close behind. In a  half hour there must have been a quart of bees on the bait. By this  time I had seen a number of bees fly due west and some due east. So  taking another hot stone and going some distance on the course  west, I put the stone down, burnt more comb, and in a few minutes  had lots of bees. They still continued westward. The next time I  stopped where a swamp extended from the top of the mountain back  some two hundred yards. There were many large gum trees growing in  this swamp. After a while I was convinced that the bees flew at  right angles from the former course. Leaving the bait I went into  the swamp and found them going into a large gum tree about twenty  feet from the ground. My spirits were high, this being the first  bee I had ever found entirely by myself. Taking out my knife and  going up to the tree to put my initials thereon, my spirits fell as  suddenly as they had risen. There in plain view were the letters I.  W. The spirit of selfishness then showed itself. What right had  anyone to take this bee from me? I had almost come to the point of  thinking I had a monopoly in the bee hunting business and that  others had no right to intrude. I trust others do not show this  spirit and am sure I have got rid of it myself. If there is any  pleasure or benefit to be derived from anything, God certainly  intends it for all. The initials would not correspond with the name  of anyone I knew, but supposed that some time I would find out who  I. W. was. Now the bee that flew east could be looked for, but what  was the use? Hadn't the best bee hunters in the country tried to  find it and failed? Beyond a certain point all trees disappeared.  This was the only Italian bee known to be in a radius of ten miles  and it was not a great while after their introduction into this  country. So taking my way to the top of the mountain near the edge  of the swamp, I was surprised to find a cabin, and from indication  it had just been built. On going up to the door my eye fell on the  occupant, a man well up in years. In one corner was a number of  steel traps. In another a rifle of the then modern type. These  signs told me that a new hunter had taken up his abode among us. He  told me to be seated and moved over on the rude bench to make room  for me. He began by asking me what I was doing out on the mountain,  and as I was so young, no doubt had an idea that I was lost.    I told him that I was bee hunting and had found one but some one  had found it before I had, and that the initials I. W. were cut on  the tree. Turning to me he said, \"You don't know who that stands  for? Well, young man, I kin tell you. I. W. stands for Ike Ward,  and that's me. The little fellers come sippin' around my cabin and  I give 'em a little sweet water and found 'em in a jiffy.\" I then  told him of the Italian bee. He asked me why I didn't find it. The  reply was that the very best bee hunters in the country had tried  it and failed and I supposed it would be of no use for me to try  it. \"Well, they must be great bee hunters; why, young man, I would  rather undertake to find a bee than ketch a rabbit in a good  trackin' snow. The rabbit might jump up and run away, but after I  get my bee started, he's mine.\" It was getting well along in the  afternoon and I told him I must go home. \"Well, your folks might  think something has happened to you and I won't ask ye to stay any  longer; but come up again and we will find that yaller bee.\" I  thanked him and asked when it would suit him to go. \"You kin come  any time you keer to, but ye'd better come early when you do come,  fer I might be out scoutin' round and not be home.\" That proposed  bee hunt was the only thing thought of on my way home, the only  thought that went with me to my bed, and in my dreams I saw the  most beautiful yellow bees in the world on combs of snowy  whiteness, some of them as large as a door.

Sometime early in the spring of 1903, a letter was received from a  man in Pennsylvania and published in H-T-T, which a few weeks later  brought to light one of the truest and best sportsmen that ever  shouldered a gun, strung a snare or set a trap--E. N. Woodcock.    Some of the happenings are repeated and all dates may not be correct,  for be it remembered that Mr. Woodcock has written all from memory.  It is doubtful if he kept all copies of H-T-T, therefore was not sure  if such and such incidents had been written before. In most cases  these are somewhat different and as they all \"fit in\" we have used  them as written and published from time to time.    Much information is also contained in the writings of Mr. Woodcock  and whether you use gun, steel traps, deadfalls or snares, you will  find something of value. The articles are also written in a style  that impresses all of their truthfulness, but, so written that they  are very interesting.    Those of our readers who have read his articles will be glad of this  opportunity to get his writings in book form, while those that have  only read a few of his more recent articles will be pleased to secure  all.    Perhaps the following editorial which appeared in H-T-T will be in  place here:    \"Although crippled with rheumatism, there is an old hunter and  trapper living in Potter County, Pa., whose enthusiasm is high and  his greatest desire is still to get out over the trap lines a few  seasons before the end of the \"trail\" of life's journey is reached.  May that desire be fulfilled is the earnest wish of the H-T-T as well  as thousands of our readers, who have read the writings of this  kind-hearted and wide experienced hunter and trapper, as they have been  penned from his home near the Allegheny Mountains.    It is with pleasure that we publish in this issue the \"Autobiography  of E. N. Woodcock as a Trapper.\" During his half century with trap  and gun, he has had some narrow escapes and experiences, but not the  many \"hair-breadth escapes\" that some claim, but which only occur on  paper. Mr. Woodcock is a truthful man, and you can read his  autobiography knowing that it is the truth even to the minutest  detail.\"    The autobiography was written by Mr. Woodcock at the request of the  Editor of Hunter-Trader-Trapper in the spring of 1908 and published  July of the same year. We are glad to add that since that time, Mr.  Woodcock has enjoyed several hunting and trapping expeditions. Some  were in his home state--Pennsylvania--on same grounds, or at least  near those he camped on many, many years ago. He also took a couple  of trips into the south--fall of 1911 and 1912. He was in Tennessee,  Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas. An account of these hunts is  given in Chapters XXX, XXXI and XXXII.    In May, 1912, the Editor of Hunter-Trader-Trapper visited Mr.  Woodcock and family at their home some four miles from Coudersport,  Pennsylvania. Mr. Woodcock, though physically not large, is a  wonderful man in the \"ways of the woods.\" He is not given to  exaggeration or boasting like many a man who has followed the Trail  and Trap Line. Every word that he says or writes can be put down as  truthful beyond a doubt.    At this time, (May, 1912) he was afraid he would never be able to get  out on the trap line again, as he was suffering from rheumatism and  heart trouble. Towards fall he became better, and enjoyed the sport,  which for more than fifty years has been his--may he be spared to  enjoy many more.    By noting the dates as given in connection with various articles  published, it will be seen that Mr. Woodcock shortly after 1900 began  to point out the need of protection to game and fur animals. After a  life on the trap and trail of more than fifty years, such advice  should be far reaching. Mr. Woodcock is a man of unusual foresight  and knowing that he is nearing the end of the trail, wishes to  forcibly impress the needs of protection.    By referring to a good map, you will be able to see the location of  many of Mr. Woodcock's hunting, camping and trapping trips, as he  generally mentions State, County and Streams.    Very few men have had wider experience than Mr. Woodcock. He knows  from more than a half century much of the habits and characteristics  of animals. He gives his reasons why marten are plentiful in one  section and are gone in a few days. His reason too, looks plausible.  He describes trapping wolves in Upper Michigan about 1880, also  beaver. Tells how he caught the \"shadow of the forests\" as wolves are  often called by trappers--they are so hard to trap. By reading of his  many experiences you will not only enjoy what he says, but will get  facts about bear, deer, fox, wolves, mink, marten and other fur  bearers that you had never thought of.    This man, while on the \"trail\" upwards of fifty years, so far as  known never killed out of season or trapped unprime furs.        A WORD FROM MR. WOODCOCK.    The editor of HUNTER-TRADER-TRAPPER has requested a foreword of  introductory to FIFTY YEARS A HUNTER AND TRAPPER OR EXPERIENCE OF E.  N. WOODCOCK, saying that so many have enjoyed my articles, which have  appeared from time to time in HUNTER-TRADER-TRAPPER, extending over a  period of some ten years, 1903 to 1913, that same are to be published  in book form.    I was born at Lymansville, Potter County, Pennsylvania, August 30,  1844. From early childhood, my nature led me to the Forests and  Streams. I have hunted in many of the states of the Far West  including the three Pacific States--California, Oregon and  Washington. I killed my first panther or cougar in the mountains of  Idaho on the headwaters of the Clearwater river. My first real  experience in wolfing was in Southeastern Oregon. I met my greatest  number of deer in Northwestern California.    I have trapped of late years, in nearly all of the states east of the  Mississippi river and also on the White River of Arkansas; also  trapped bear and other fur bearing animals and hunted deer in  Northern Michigan, also forty years ago.    Another sport which I enjoyed was the \"pigeon days.\" I have netted  wild pigeons from the Adirondack Mountains in New York state to  Indian Territory--now Oklahoma--trapping them in the states of  Michigan, Indiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania and New York.    My nature led me to the Trail and Trap line from early childhood and  I have trapped bear and hunted deer in the mountains of Pennsylvania  for more than 50 years--half a century--and my picture with my two  foxes on my shoulder shows me on the trap line for the season of  1912-13.    March 1, 1913.    E. N. WOODCOCK.        CHAPTER I.    Autobiography of E. N. Woodcock.    I was born on the 30th day of August, A. D. 1844, in a little village  by the name of Lymansville, Potter County, Pennsylvania. Lymansville  was named after my grandparent, Isaac Lyman, or better known as Major  Lyman, having held office of that rank in the Revolutionary War. It  is from this limb of the family that I inherited that uncontrollable  desire for the trap, gun and the wild.    At a very early age it was my greatest delight to have all the mice,  squirrels and groundhogs and in later years young raccoons, young fox  and every other varmint or wild animal that I could catch or could  get from other sources, and at times I had quite a menagerie.    I began trapping at a very early age, the same as many boys do who  live out in the country where they"]]]
