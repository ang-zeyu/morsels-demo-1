Footnote numbers,  in brackets, start anew at (1) for each piece of dialogue, and each  footnote follows immediately the dialogue to which it refers, labeled  thus: f(1).          INTRODUCTION        'The Birds' differs markedly from all the other Comedies of Aristophanes  which have come down to us in subject and general conception. It is  just an extravaganza pure and simple--a graceful, whimsical theme chosen  expressly for the sake of the opportunities it afforded of bright,  amusing dialogue, pleasing lyrical interludes, and charming displays of  brilliant stage effects and pretty dresses. Unlike other plays of  the same Author, there is here apparently no serious political MOTIF  underlying the surface burlesque and buffoonery.    Some critics, it is true, profess to find in it a reference to the  unfortunate Sicilian Expedition, then in progress, and a prophecy of  its failure and the political downfall of Alcibiades. But as a matter of  fact, the whole thing seems rather an attempt on the dramatist's part  to relieve the overwrought minds of his fellow-citizens, anxious and  discouraged at the unsatisfactory reports from before Syracuse, by a  work conceived in a lighter vein than usual and mainly unconnected with  contemporary realities. The play was produced in the year 414 B.C., just  when success or failure in Sicily hung in the balance, though already  the outlook was gloomy, and many circumstances pointed to impending  disaster. Moreover, the public conscience was still shocked and  perturbed over the mysterious affair of the mutilation of the Hermae,  which had occurred immediately before the sailing of the fleet, and  strongly suspicious of Alcibiades' participation in the outrage. In  spite of the inherent charm of the subject, the splendid outbursts of  lyrical poetry in some of the choruses and the beauty of the scenery and  costumes, 'The Birds' failed to win the first prize. This was acclaimed  to a play of Aristophanes' rival, Amipsias, the title of which, 'The  Comastoe,' or 'Revellers,' \"seems to imply that the chief interest was  derived from direct allusions to the outrage above mentioned and to the  individuals suspected to have been engaged in it.\"    For this reason, which militated against its immediate success, viz.  the absence of direct allusion to contemporary politics--there are, of  course, incidental references here and there to topics and personages  of the day--the play appeals perhaps more than any other of our Author's  productions to the modern reader. Sparkling wit, whimsical fancy, poetic  charm, are of all ages, and can be appreciated as readily by ourselves  as by an Athenian audience of two thousand years ago, though, of course,  much is inevitably lost \"without the important adjuncts of music,  scenery, dresses and what we may call 'spectacle' generally, which we  know in this instance to have been on the most magnificent scale.\"    The plot is this. Euelpides and Pisthetaerus, two old Athenians,  disgusted with the litigiousness, wrangling and sycophancy of their  countrymen, resolve upon quitting Attica. Having heard of the fame of  Epops (the hoopoe), sometime called Tereus, and now King of the Birds,  they determine, under the direction of a raven and a jackdaw, to seek  from him and his subject birds a city free from all care and strife.  Arrived at the Palace of Epops, they knock, and Trochilus (the wren),  in a state of great flutter, as he mistakes them for fowlers, opens the  door and informs them that his Majesty is asleep. When he awakes, the  strangers appear before him, and after listening to a long and eloquent  harangue on the superior attractions of a residence among the birds,  they propose a notable scheme of their own to further enhance its  advantages and definitely secure the sovereignty of the universe now  exercised by the gods of Olympus.    The birds are summoned to meet in general council. They come flying up  from all quarters of the heavens, and after a brief mis-understanding,  during which they come near tearing the two human envoys to pieces, they  listen to the exposition of the latters' plan. This is nothing less  than the building of a new city, to be called Nephelococcygia, or  'Cloud-cuckoo-town,' between earth and heaven, to be garrisoned and  guarded by the birds in such a way as to intercept all communication of  the gods with their worshippers on earth. All steam of sacrifice will  be prevented from rising to Olympus, and the Immortals will very soon be  starved into an acceptance of any terms proposed. The new Utopia is duly  constructed, and the daring plan to secure the sovereignty is in a fair  way to succeed. Meantime various quacks and charlatans, each with a  special scheme for improving things, arrive from earth, and are one  after the other exposed and dismissed. Presently arrives Prometheus,  who informs Epops of the desperate straits to which the gods are by this  time reduced, and advises him to push his claims and demand the hand  of Basileia (Dominion), the handmaid of Zeus. Next an embassy from the  Olympians appears on the scene, consisting of Heracles, Posidon and a  god from the savage regions of the Triballians. After some disputation,  it is agreed that all reasonable demands of the birds are to be granted,  while Pisthetaerus is to have Basileia as his bride. The comedy winds up  with the epithalamium in honour of the nuptials.

EUELPIDES (TO HIS JAY)(1) Do you think I should walk straight for yon  tree?    f(1) Euelpides is holding a jay and Pisthetaerus a crow; they are the  guides who are to lead them to the kingdom of the birds.    PISTHETAERUS (TO HIS CROW) Cursed beast, what are you croaking to  me?... to retrace my steps?    EUELPIDES Why, you wretch, we are wandering at random, we are exerting  ourselves only to return to the same spot; 'tis labour lost.    PISTHETAERUS To think that I should trust to this crow, which has made  me cover more than a thousand furlongs!    EUELPIDES And that I to this jay, which has torn every nail from my  fingers!    PISTHETAERUS If only I knew where we were....    EUELPIDES Could you find your country again from here?    PISTHETAERUS No, I feel quite sure I could not, any more than could  Execestides(1) find his.    f(1) A stranger who wanted to pass as an Athenian, although coming  originally for a far-away barbarian country.    EUELPIDES Oh dear! oh dear!    PISTHETAERUS Aye, aye, my friend, 'tis indeed the road of \"oh dears\" we  are following.    EUELPIDES That Philocrates, the bird-seller, played us a scurvy trick,  when he pretended these two guides could help us to find Tereus,(1) the  Epops, who is a bird, without being born of one. He has indeed sold us  this jay, a true son of Tharelides,(2) for an obolus, and this crow  for three, but what can they do? Why, nothing whatever but bite and  scratch!--What's the matter with you then, that you keep opening your  beak? Do you want us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks? There  is no road that way.    f(1) A king of Thrace, a son of Ares, who married Procne, the daughter  of Pandion, King of Athens, whom he had assisted against the Megarians.  He violated his sister-in-law, Philomela, and then cut out her tongue;  she nevertheless managed to convey to her sister how she had been  treated. They both agreed to kill Itys, whom Procne had borne to Tereus,  and dished up the limbs of his own son to the father; at the end of  the meal Philomela appeared and threw the child's head upon the table.  Tereus rushed with drawn sword upon the princesses, but all the actors  in this terrible scene were metamorph(o)sed. Tereus became an Epops  (hoopoe), Procne a swallow, Philomela a nightingale, and Itys a  goldfinch. According to Anacreon and Apollodorus it was Procne who  became the nightingale and Philomela the swallow, and this is the  version of the tradition followed by Aristophanes.    f(2) An Athenian who had some resemblance to a jay--so says the  scholiast, at any rate.    PISTHETAERUS Not even the vestige of a track in any direction.    EUELPIDES And what does the crow say about the road to follow?    PISTHETAERUS By Zeus, it no longer croaks the same thing it did.    EUELPIDES And which way does it tell us to go now?    PISTHETAERUS It says that, by dint of gnawing, it will devour my  fingers.    EUELPIDES What misfortune is ours! we strain every nerve to get to the  birds,(1) do everything we can to that end, and we cannot find our way!  Yes, spectators, our madness is quite different from that of Sacas.  He is not a citizen, and would fain be one at any cost; we, on the  contrary, born of an honourable tribe and family and living in the midst  of our fellow-citizens, we have fled from our country as hard as ever  we could go. 'Tis not that we hate it; we recognize it to be great and  rich, likewise that everyone has the right to ruin himself; but the  crickets only chirrup among the fig-trees for a month or two, whereas  the Athenians spend their whole lives in chanting forth judgments  from their law-courts"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30181"],[0,"Fungi: Their Nature and Uses (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                    THE INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC SERIES.

As my name appears on the title-page of this volume, it is necessary  that I should exactly state what part I had in its preparation. I had  no doubt originally engaged to undertake the work myself; but finding,  from multiplicity of engagements and my uncertain health, that I could  not accomplish it satisfactorily, I thought the best course I could  take was to recommend Mr. Cooke to the publishers; a gentleman well  known, not only in this country, but in the United States. The whole  of the work has therefore been prepared by himself, the manuscript and  proof sheets being submitted to me from time to time, in which I  merely suggested such additions as seemed needful, subjoining  occasionally a few notes. As the work is intended for students, the  author has had no hesitation in repeating what has been stated in  former chapters where it has been thought to prove useful. I have no  doubt that the same high character will justly apply to this as to Mr.  Cooke's former publications, and especially to his \"Handbook of  British Fungi.\"                                                           M.
