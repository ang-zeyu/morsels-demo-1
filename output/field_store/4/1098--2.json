With the January number of BIRDS, we enter upon a new year with the  satisfaction of having pleased our readers, as well as rendered an  actual service to the cause of education, ornithological literature, and  art. Among the hundreds of testimonials from competent judges, (many of  them scientists), which we have received, we will permit ourselves the  use of one only, as exemplifying the excellence which we have sought to  attain and the rightful claim which we may make for the future. The  writer says: \"I find BIRDS an everlasting source of pleasure to the  children, not less than to myself. I have one of the few almost  absolutely _fresh_ copies of 'Audubon's Birds,' for which I have refused  $3,000, besides later works, and I will say that the pictures of birds  given in your magazine are infinitely more true to life, and more  pleasing, everyway, than any of those presented in either work. The  other day I compared some of your pictures with the birds mounted  by myself, notably a Wood-duck and a Wood-cock, and every marking  co-incided. The photographs might have been taken from my own specimens,  so accurately were they delineated, attesting the truth of your work.\"    Some of our subscribers, unaware of the prodigality with which nature  has scattered birds throughout the world, have asked whether the supply  of specimens may not soon be exhausted. Our answer is, that there are  many thousands of rare and attractive birds, all of them interesting  for study, from which, for years to come, we might select many of the  loveliest forms and richest plumage. Of North American birds alone there  are more than twelve hundred species.    The success of BIRDS is due to its superior color illustrations and  the unique treatment of the text. Popular and yet scientific, it is  interesting to old and young alike.    The classification and nomenclature followed are those adopted by the  American Ornithological Union in 1895.                                       NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING COMPANY.          THE PIGEONS.          Under the big nursery table      Are Sue, Don, Harold, and Mabel,      All playing, with joy and delight,      That pigeons they are, dressed in white.        Don't you hear their gentle \"coo, coo\"?      Ah, now they fly out in full view!      And over the meadow they go--      'Tis their own dear nursery, you know--        Where, quick to the tops of the trees      They fly, with lightness and ease;      There each birdie is glad to be      Perched high upon a big chair-tree.        But to their home in swiftest flight      They haste, ere day has changed to night;      Then in they go, with cooing sweet,      And find their home a blest retreat.        And now they tell just where they've been,      And all the wondrous sights they've seen.      Then with their \"coo, coo,\" soft and low,      Each pigeon goes to sleep, I trow.                            --EMMA G. SAULSBURY.           [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad.

ILLUSTRATED BY COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY           ================================           VOL. III. JANUARY, 1898.  NO. 1.           ================================          THE CROWNED PIGEON.      We regret that a full monograph of this remarkable bird cannot be  given in this number. It is the giant among Pigeons and has some  characteristics, on account of its great size, not common to the family.  Very little has been written about it, and it would be a real service to  ornithology if some one familiar with the subject would communicate his  knowledge to the public. These birds pair for life, and the loss or  death of a mate is in many cases mourned and grieved over, the survivor  frequently refusing to be consoled.    The Pigeon family is an exceedingly interesting one, of great variety of  form and color, undergoing constant change by inter-breeding. There are  about three hundred known species of Pigeons and Doves, about one third  of which number are found in the New World. In North America but twelve  species occur, a family small enough to find room in BIRDS to sit for  their pictures. Some of these birds, says Chapman, are arboreal, others  are strictly terrestrial. Some seek the forests and others prefer the  fields and clearings. Some nest in colonies, others in isolated pairs,  but most species are found in flocks of greater or less size after the  nesting season. When drinking, they do not raise the head as others do  to swallow, but keep the bill immersed until the draught is finished.  The young are born naked and are fed by regurgitation.    Living specimens of this the largest species of Pigeons may some day be  brought to the United States and made to increase as the Ring-necked  English Pheasant has already been domesticated in their own country. It  has been suggested that their introduction among us would be a  comparatively easy matter.          THE RED-EYED VIREO.      \"A bird with red eyes! look, mamma,\" said Bobby. \"How funny!\"    \"And how beautiful,\" replied his mamma. \"Not plainly dressed, like his  cousin, the Warbling Vireo, whose picture you saw in the October number  of BIRDS.\"    \"The Yellow-Throated, in the June number,\" said Bobbie, who has a  remarkable memory, \"was a lovely bird, too, mamma. Can Mr. Red-eye  sing?\"    \"No, you can't call his note a song; it is more like a chatter, which he  keeps up from morning till night.\"    \"Like some children,\" said Bobbie, with a sage nod of the head, \"who  talk all day long.\"    \"Yes,\" smiled his mamma, \"without saying very much, either. But this  little bird works while he chatters.\"    \"I reckon he stops at noon time,\" said Bobbie, \"as other birds do.\"    \"No, even then the silence of the woods is broken by the Red-eyed  Vireo's voice. He is such a busy little fellow, he can't find time for a  nap.\"    \"Hm!\" remarked Bobbie; \"the other birds must find him a tiresome fellow,  I think.    \"Has he any other names, mamma?\"    \"Yes, he is called the Red-eyed Greenlet or Red-eyed Fly-catcher. One  gentleman calls him 'The Preacher.' To him the bird seems to say, '_You  see it; you know it; do you hear me? do you believe it?_'\"    \"I'm going to look out for that red-eyed preacher next summer,\" said  Bobby, with a laugh.    \"One lady who makes a study of birds thinks he says, '_I know it! would  you think it? musn't touch it; you'll rue it!_' He makes a pause, as you  see, after each sentence.\"    \"Tell me something about their nests?\" said Bobbie, deeply interested.    \"They are made of bark fibers, cobwebs, bits of paper, and scraps of  hornets' nests, in the form of a little pocket. This is suspended from  the fork of two or more twigs high up in the tree, making a sort of  cradle for the little ones.\"        \"Rock-a-by, baby, on the tree top,       When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.\"    hummed Bobby. \"How jolly!\"    \"Yes,\" said mamma; \"and they take care that it is under some green  leaves, which act as an umbrella to keep the sun out of the mother's  eyes while she sits on the four pretty white eggs.\"    \"And out of the little ones' red eyes, too,\" laughed Bobbie. \"How  cute!\"           [Illustration: From col.

Red-eyed Vireo, Red-eyed Greenlet, and Red-eyed Fly-catcher are the  names variously applied to this pretty representative of his family, of  which there are about fifty species. The Red-eye is an inhabitant of  Central America and Mexico, its northern limit being the lower Rio  Grande valley in Texas.    The exquisite little creature is tinted even more delicately than the  Wax-wing, but with much the same glossy look and elegant air. The  ruby-tinted eye, and the conspicuous white line above it, with its  border, are good characteristics by which to distinguish it from its  relatives.    The Red-eyed Vireo is found alike in the shade trees of lawns, in  orchards or woodlands, and is especially fond of sycamore groves along  streams. The male is a tireless songster, and even at noon-tide of a  sultry summer-day, when all other warblers are silent, his monotonous  song will be heard. _He-ha-wha_, or _he, ha, whip_, in rising  inflection, and _he, ha, whee_, in falling cadence. He has also a  _chip_, a chatter like a miniature of the Oriole's scold, heard only in  the season of courtship, and a peculiarly characteristic querulous note  which, like others, can not be described with accuracy.    \"The Preacher,\" a name which Wilson Flagg has given this Vireo, exactly  reflects the character of the bird and its song. \"His style of preaching  is not declamation,\" says the writer. \"Though constantly talking, he  takes the part of a deliberate orator who explains his subject in a few  words and then makes a pause for his hearers to reflect upon it. We  might suppose him to be repeating moderately, with a pause between each  sentence, 'You see it--You know it--Do you hear me?--Do you believe  it?' All these strains are delivered with a rising inflection at the  close, and with a pause, as if waiting for an answer.\"    From morning till night this cheery bird sings as he works, from May to  September. \"His tender and pathetic utterances,\" says Brewer, \"are in  striking contrast to the apparent indifference or unconsciousness of the  little vocalist who, while thus delighting the ear of the listener,  seems to be all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images produced by Core Historical  Literature in Agriculture (CHLA), Cornell University)            Transcriber's Notes    This plain text version of the book has been prepared using the Latin-1  character set.

AGRICULTURAL BOOK PUBLISHER.                             1865.    Entered according to an Act of Congress in the year 1847    By RICHARD L. ALLEN,    In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for the  Southern District of New York.          INTRODUCTION.      The object of the following work, on the History, Breeding, Management,  Diseases, &c., of Domestic Animals, is to afford the Stock-breeder and  Grazier a connected view of the entire subject in which he has so deep  an interest. The writer has endeavored to compress within the limited  space assumed as necessary to secure a general circulation and perusal,  such principles and practice, and give to each that relative prominence,  which it becomes the practical man to observe, to realize the greatest  amount of value for the labor and capital devoted to his pursuits.    Their history is essential, as it shows their introduction into the  United States, their progress during the various stages of their  improvement, and the comparative value of the improved and ordinary  breeds. A knowledge of the best mode of breeding and management is of  still higher importance. The first will enable the breeder to preserve  the high character of the animals in his hands, or perhaps still farther  to advance them; while proper management and feeding will prevent that  deterioration and loss from disease, which frequently subtract so much  from his profits.    A larger space has been purposely devoted to the last topics, in  preference to the subject of diseases, as prevention is not only less  troublesome than cure, but much more economical. Feeding and management,  after breeding, are really the important objects in view to the  Stock-breeder and Grazier, for if these be judiciously attended to,  disease among the herds will rarely be known.    The subject of animal diseases is complicated and little understood; and  to be properly comprehended, requires years close, intelligent study,  under every advantage for obtaining the necessary information. Nearly  every disorder assumes various shades of difference, and to remove it  effectually a corresponding change of treatment is required. How absurd  then the idea, that a compilation of formal remedies, administered by an  unskilful or inexperienced manager, will be of material service in  rescuing his herds or flocks from the ravages of disease. All that can  consistently be done, is to give a few simple remedies for the most  common and well-known ailments, and leave to nature or a professional  farrier, such as are more complex or unusual.    This work (with many subsequent and important additions) constitutes a  small part of the \"Compend of American Agriculture,\" the favorable  reception of which, though but recently given to the public, has induced  the writer to offer this important division of the subject in its  present detached form.
