Elwes          PART I. CONCERNING GOD.    DEFINITIONS.      I.  By that which is self--caused, I mean that of which the  essence involves existence, or that of which the nature is only  conceivable as existent.    II.  A thing is called finite after its kind, when it can be  limited by another thing of the same nature; for instance, a  body is called finite because we always conceive another greater  body.  So, also, a thought is limited by another thought, but a  body is not limited by thought, nor a thought by body.    III.  By substance, I mean that which is in itself, and is  conceived through itself: in other words, that of which a  conception can be formed independently of any other conception.    IV.  By attribute, I mean that which the intellect perceives as  constituting the essence of substance.    V.  By mode, I mean the modifications[1] of substance, or that  which exists in, and is conceived through, something other than  itself.    [1] \"Affectiones\"    VI.  By God, I mean a being absolutely infinite--that is, a  substance consisting in infinite attributes, of which each  expresses eternal and infinite essentiality.    Explanation--I say absolutely infinite, not infinite after its  kind: for, of a thing infinite only after its kind, infinite  attributes may be denied; but that which is absolutely infinite,  contains in its essence whatever expresses reality, and involves  no negation.    VII.  That thing is called free, which exists solely by the  necessity of its own nature, and of which the action is  determined by itself alone.  On the other hand, that thing is  necessary, or rather constrained, which is determined by  something external to itself to a fixed and definite method of  existence or action.    VIII.  By eternity, I mean existence itself, in so far as it is  conceived necessarily to follow solely from the definition of  that which is eternal.    Explanation--Existence of this kind is conceived as an eternal  truth, like the essence of a thing, and, therefore, cannot be  explained by means of continuance or time, though continuance may  be conceived without a beginning or end.      AXIOMS.    I.  Everything which exists, exists either in itself or in  something else.    II.  That which cannot be conceived through anything else must be  conceived through itself.    III.  From a given definite cause an effect necessarily follows;  and, on the other hand, if no definite cause be granted, it is  impossible that an effect can follow.    IV.  The knowledge of an effect depends on and involves the  knowledge of a cause.    V.  Things which have nothing in common cannot be understood, the  one by means of the other; the conception of one does not  involve the conception of the other.    VI.  A true idea must correspond with its ideate or object.    VII.  If a thing can be conceived as non--existing, its essence  does not involve existence.      PROPOSITIONS.    PROP. I.  Substance is by nature prior to its modifications.    Proof.--This is clear from Deff. iii. and v.    PROP. II.  Two substances, whose attributes are different, have  nothing in common.    Proof.--Also evident from Def. iii.  For each must exist in  itself, and be conceived through itself; in other words, the  conception of one does not imply the conception of the other.    PROP. III.  Things which have nothing in common cannot be one the  cause of the other.    Proof.--If they have nothing in common, it follows that one  cannot be apprehended by means of the other (Ax. v.), and,  therefore, one cannot be the cause of the other (Ax. iv.).  Q.E.D.    PROP. IV.  Two or more distinct things are distinguished one from  the other, either by the difference of the attributes of the  substances, or by the difference of their modifications.    Proof.--Everything which exists, exists either in itself or in  something else (Ax. i.),--that is (by Deff. iii. and v.), nothing  is granted in addition to the understanding, except substance and  its modifications.  Nothing is, therefore, given besides the  understanding, by which several things may be distinguished one  from the other, except the substances, or, in other words (see  Ax. iv.), their attributes and modifications.  Q.E.D.    PROP. V.  There cannot exist in the universe two or more  substances having the same nature or attribute.    Proof.--If several distinct substances be granted, they must  be distinguished one from the other, either by the difference of  their attributes, or by the difference of their modifications  (Prop. iv.).  If only by the difference of their attributes, it  will be granted that there cannot be more than one with an  identical attribute.  If by the difference of their  modifications--as substance is naturally prior to its  modifications (Prop. i.),--it follows that setting the  modifications aside, and considering substance in itself, that is  truly, (Deff. iii. and vi.), there cannot be conceived one  substance different from another,--that is (by Prop. iv.), there  cannot be granted several substances, but one substance only.  Q.E.D.    PROP. VI.  One substance cannot be produced by another substance.    Proof.--It is impossible that there should be in the universe  two substances with an identical attribute, i.e. which have  anything common to them both (Prop. ii.), and, therefore (Prop.  iii.), one cannot be the cause of the other, neither can one be  produced by the other.  Q.E.D.    Corollary.--Hence it follows that a substance cannot be  produced by anything external to itself.  For in the universe  nothing is granted, save substances and their modifications (as  appears from Ax. i. and Deff. iii. and v.).  Now (by the last  Prop.) substance cannot be produced by another substance,  therefore it cannot be produced by anything external to itself.  Q.E.D.  This is shown still more readily by the absurdity of the  contradictory.  For, if substance be produced by an external  cause, the knowledge of it would depend on the knowledge of its  cause (Ax. iv.), and (by Def. iii.) it would itself not be  substance.    PROP. VII.  Existence belongs to the nature of substances.    Proof.--Substance cannot be produced by anything external  (Corollary, Prop vi.), it must, therefore, be its own cause--that  is, its essence necessarily involves existence, or existence  belongs to its nature.    PROP. VIII.  Every substance is necessarily infinite.    Proof.--There can only be one substance with an identical  attribute, and existence follows from its nature (Prop. vii.);  its nature, therefore, involves existence, either as finite or  infinite.  It does not exist as finite, for (by Def. ii.) it  would then be limited by something else of the same kind, which  would also necessarily exist (Prop. vii.); and there would be  two substances with an identical attribute, which is absurd  (Prop. v.).  It therefore exists as infinite.  Q.E.D.    Note I.--As finite existence involves a partial negation, and  infinite existence is the absolute affirmation of the given  nature, it follows (solely from Prop. vii.) that every substance  is necessarily infinite.    Note II.--No doubt it will be difficult for those who think  about things loosely, and have not been accustomed to know them  by their primary causes, to comprehend the demonstration of Prop.  vii.: for such persons make no distinction between the  modifications of substances and the substances themselves, and  are ignorant of the manner in which things are produced; hence  they may attribute to substances the beginning which they observe  in natural objects.  Those who are ignorant of true causes, make  complete confusion--think that trees might talk just as well as  men--that men might be formed from stones as well as from seed;  and imagine that any form might be changed into any other. So,  also, those who confuse the two natures, divine and human,  readily attribute human passions to the deity, especially so long  as they do not know how passions originate in the mind.  But, if  people would consider the nature of substance, they would have no  doubt about the truth of Prop. vii.  In fact, this proposition  would be a universal axiom, and accounted a truism.  For, by  substance, would be understood that which is in itself, and is  conceived through itself--that is, something of which the  conception requires not the conception of anything else; whereas  modifications exist in something external to themselves, and a  conception of them is formed by means of a conception of the  thing in which they exist.  Therefore, we may have true ideas of  non--existent modifications; for, although they may have no  actual existence apart from the conceiving intellect, yet their  essence is so involved in something external to themselves that  they may through it be conceived.  Whereas the only truth  substances can have, external to the intellect, must consist in  their existence, because they are conceived through themselves.  Therefore, for a person to say that he has a clear and  distinct--that is, a true--idea of a substance, but that he is not  sure whether such substance exists, would be the same as if he  said that he had a true idea, but was not sure whether or no it  was false (a little consideration will make this plain); or if  anyone affirmed that substance is created, it would be the same  as saying that a false idea was true--in short, the height of  absurdity.  It must, then, necessarily be admitted that the  existence of substance as its essence is an eternal truth.  And  we can hence conclude by another process of reasoning--that there  is but one such substance.  I think that this may profitably be  done at once; and, in order to proceed regularly with the  demonstration, we must premise:----    1.

APPLETON & CO.    1912        _Published November 1912_        Printed in the United States          PREFACE.      To learn to call a bird by its right name is the first step in the  study of ornithology. We may propose to investigate the structure,  food, and habits of the birds of the world, or desire merely a  superficial knowledge of the species found in our garden, but in  either case we are at once confronted by this question of  identification.    From the scientific point of view there is but one satisfactory way to  identify a bird. A specimen of it should be in hand in order that its  form, color, and size may be accurately determined, when, with the aid  of analytical keys, with which most text-books are provided, it is a  simple matter to ascertain the bird's name.    Wide experience has shown the writer, however, that where one dead  bird is identified, hundreds of attempts are made to name the living  bird in nature. This is to be expected. It is the natural outcome of  the recent remarkable interest in the study of birds which, fostered  by Audubon Societies and nature study teachers, has assumed an  ethical and educational importance of the first magnitude.    We cannot place a gun in the hands of these thousands of bird-lovers  whom we are yearly developing; indeed most of them would refuse to use  it. Specimens, therefore, are rarely available to them and we should  make some special effort to meet their peculiar wants. The present  volume has been prepared with this end in view. Identification of the  bird in the bush is its sole end; an end, however, which we trust will  prove but the beginning of a new and potent interest in nature.                                                          FRANK M. CHAPMAN      _American Museum of Natural History,    New York City, 1903._          PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION.      In the present edition of the Color Key the body of the book, aside  from the correction of typographical errors, remains as it was in the  preceding edition. The Systematic Table has been reset and brought up  to July, 1912, the date of the publication of the latest supplement to  the third edition of the American Ornithologists' Union's 'Check-List  of North American Birds.' Two Appendixes are added. The first includes  all the changes in nomenclature and descriptions of new birds which  have been accepted by the A.O.U. Committee on Classification and  Nomenclature since the publication of the Color Key in 1903; the  second contains a list of faunal ornithological papers which it is  hoped will add greatly to the reference value of the book.

They do not pretend to be perfect  reproductions of every shade and tint of the plumage of the species  they figure, but aim to present a bird's characteristic colors as they  appear when seen at a distance. It was impracticable to draw all the  birds to the same scale but all those on the same page are so figured.  Reference should always be made, however, to the measurements given at  the beginning at each description. The figures are based on the male  bird.      LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS.      [Male].   The sign of Mars, signifying male.      [Female]. The sign of Venus, signifying female.      Ad. Adult, a bird in fully mature plumage.      Yng. Young, a fully grown bird which has not yet acquired the         plumage of the adult.      L. Length, the distance from the tip of the bill to the end of the       tail. This measurement is made from dead birds, birds in life       appear somewhat shorter.      W. Wing, the distance from the 'bend' of the wing to the end of the       longest feather.      T. Tail, the distance from the insertion of the tail-feathers to the       end of the longest one.      Tar. Tarsus, the distance from the heel to the insertion of the toes,         or of the so-called 'leg."]]]
