THEO. PRESSER CO., Pub's., Phila., Pa.                                   HOW TO USE THIS BOOK      This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF GREAT  MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of \"Pictures from the Lives  of the Great Composers for Children,\" \"Music Talks with Children,\"  \"First Studies in Music Biography,\" and others.    The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the  child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place  throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as  will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to  cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the  corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around  each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.    After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the  book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the  great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous  pages.    The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the  cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's  own book.    This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting  task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to  the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth  while.                       *       *       *       *       *    This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians includes at  present a book on each of the following:            Bach                                         MacDowell          Beethoven                                    Mendelssohn          Brahms                                       Mozart          Chopin                                       Schubert          Grieg                                        Schumann          Handel                                       Tschaikowsky          Haydn                                        Verdi          Liszt                                        Wagner                               Printed in U.

The Story of the Boy Who Wrote Little Plays      A very odd house used to stand in the quaint old Saxon City of Leipzig.  This house was called the Red and White Lion. I suppose no one ever  really saw a lion that was red and white, but nevertheless that was the  name of the house. There, was born Richard Wagner, who was one day to  write the wonderful opera scenes of which we will soon read.                              [Illustration: No. 2                            WAGNER'S BIRTHPLACE]    Richard Wagner's day of birth was May 22, 1813. That was more than a  century ago! More than twelve hundred months!    Since that time, music has changed very greatly. When Wagner was born,  much of the music that was being written had to follow certain patterns  or models just as architects follow certain patterns in building a  house. Now the composer when he writes music feels a great deal freer as  he knows that he can make his own patterns,--that he is not held in by  any such hard laws as those which held back such composers as Mozart,  Bach, Haydn and Handel. It was Wagner who did much to set music free  from the old barriers. This does not mean that music to-day is better  than music that was written by Haydn and Beethoven. Indeed it often is  not nearly so good, but it is freer, less held down by rule.                              [Illustration: No. 3                                TANNHAEUSER]    When Wagner wrote his first opera that had any success (Rienzi) he  followed the models of composers of the day, but when he came to write  operas that followed, such as Flying Dutchman, Lohengrin and Tannhaeuser,  he struck out in new and fresh paths which made him many enemies at  first and many friends later.    As we read of a great man we must learn to see the world as it was in  his day.    Today we think of the world as the home of our parents, of ourselves and  of our friends; as the world of Mr. Edison, Mr. Wilson and Mr.  Roosevelt. In the world of Wagner there was not one of these.    Who were the great musicians when he was a boy? Well, here are some of  them. Can you tell one fact about each of the men whose pictures come  next?                             [Illustration: No. 4]                                   LISZT                             [Illustration: No. 5]                                  SCHUMANN                             [Illustration: No. 6]                                   VERDI                             [Illustration: No. 7]                                  CHOPIN    Wagner's father died when he was only six months old, and the boy was  brought up by his mother and his step-father, who was very kind to him.  In one way Wagner was unlike most of the other great composers. He did  not show any talent for music until he was almost a man. All that he  thought of was writing plays. When he did study, he was so bright and  worked so hard that he learned in less than a year more than many learn  in a lifetime. Here is a picture of Wagner's mother, who cared for him  so tenderly.                             [Illustration: No. 8]                              WAGNER'S MOTHER    When we read the stories of Charles Dickens we make many friends. And  they are among the very best we ever have. There are Little Nell, Paul  Dombey, Sam Weller, Oliver Twist, and a host of others.    Writers like Dickens bring all sorts of people before us. _But few  composers can do such a thing._    Yet there are some who do this, and one of the greatest is Richard  Wagner. In his operas a host of people live,--people as real and as  interesting as those in the stories of Charles Dickens.    There is Walter, who sings the Prize Song in Die Meistersinger, and Eva,  whom he loves. And in the same opera there is Beckmesser, the fussy old  schoolmaster kind of a man. And Hans Sachs, the cobbler.                             [Illustration: No. 9]                        SCENE FROM DIE MEISTERSINGER    There is a lovely scene in the third act of this opera. We see a meadow  light and bright in the sunshine. A glistening river flows quietly  through it. Everywhere on the water there are boats. Scattered over the  meadow there are tents. Everybody is out for a holiday time. All is  lively and full of color and bright and cheery. Now there pass before us  the tradesmen singing in chorus. There are cobblers and carpenters led  by the town pipers. And every trade sings its own songs.    Then comes the scene in which Walter and Beckmesser sing in contest.  Beckmesser begins. He stutters and stammers and struggles through his  song. And finally, like a school-boy who does not know his lesson, he  breaks down.    Then Walter comes to sing the lovely _Prize Song_; a melody that just  sings itself into the heart of everyone.

The Story of a Little Boy Who Practiced in an Attic      When we read about the great composers we learn that they come from all  kinds of families.    Bach's parents were poor. Mendelssohn's were rich. Schubert's father was  a schoolmaster. Mozart's father was a violinist.    The story which you are to read in this book and then write out in your  own words is about a boy whose parents were neither well-to-do nor well  known.    His name is George Frederick Handel. In Germany where Handel was born  his name was Georg Friedrich Haendel (pronounced Gay-org Freed-riesh  Hayn-del). But the great composer spent so much of his life in England  that people now use the English form of his name.                              [Illustration: No. 2                            HANDEL'S BIRTHPLACE.]    Look at this queer old house where the great master was born.    Handel was born in the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach, 1685.    The father was a surgeon and barber, a queer combination. We know that  he did not like music, and that he was unwilling for his son to study  it. Of the mother we know little. But we do know that she loved her  little George Frederick, and helped him as far as she could.    The father was so determined that his son should not study music that he  refused to let him go to school. He feared, no doubt, that the boy would  soon learn to read notes.    But with the mother it was quite different. She observed the little  boy's love of music.    In the Handel home there was a big roomy attic; the ceiling was low, and  the windows had thick panes; the walls and floors were built of heavy  timber, and silence reigned there.                              [Illustration: No. 3                 THE CHILD HANDEL PRACTICING IN THE ATTIC.]    \"Here,\" said Mother Handel, \"my little boy can play the harpsichord to  his heart's content and no one will be the wiser.\" You can imagine the  surprise when the stern barber-surgeon stalked into the attic, followed  by the family, holding high the lantern.    After that it may have been agreed that the boy should practice a  little; not, however, that he might become a musician. \"No, indeed,\" we  may imagine Father Handel exclaiming, \"my son shall be a famous lawyer.\"    One day when little George was seven years old his father set out by  coach to visit another son, who was in the service of the Duke of  Saxe-Weissenfels. The little boy begged his father to let him go on the  journey. \"No,\" he replied, \"you are too young to go so far.\"    However, when the coach set out George Frederick set out too on foot to  follow, and he would not be sent home again.                              [Illustration: No. 4                   HANDEL FOLLOWING HIS FATHER'S COACH.]    He kept on trudging along as fast as his little feet would go. Every one  hoped he would get tired and go back, but finally the father had to  order the coach to stop and take him in. Thus did he show that  determination which helped him all his life.    Arrived at the castle the boy soon made friends with the chapel  musicians. They took him to the organ loft, where he played for them.    All were delighted with his talent. One day the Duke himself heard him  play. He, too, was astonished that one so young should show so much  skill. Calling the father into his presence, he pointed out how wrong it  was to deny the boy the right to study music. \"The world,\" he said,  \"should have the good of your son's great ability.\"    At the Cathedral in Handel's home city, Halle, there was a famous  organist named Zachau. He became the boy's teacher. They must have had a  busy time together, for he had lessons from Zachau not only in organ  playing, but in harmony, counterpoint, canon, and fugue; and in  hautbois, violin, and harpsichord playing.    If you will look at this picture of the harpsichord on which Handel  played, you will see that it is unlike the grand piano of our day. How  does it differ? And yet for this simple instrument Handel wrote  beautiful music. Some day you will play his Little Fugues and some of  the dances from the Suites.
