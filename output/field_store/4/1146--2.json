GOLD MEDALLIST OF ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY AND SOCIETE DE    GEOGRAPHIE, PARIS      [Illustration]      NEW YORK      CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS      1894            COPYRIGHT, 1893, BY      CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS      TROW DIRECTORY    PRINTING AND BOOKBINDING COMPANY    NEW YORK          PREFACE      The compiler of a series of sketches of American Explorers and  Travellers experiences at the very outset a serious embarrassment from  the superabundant wealth of original material at his command. The  history of America for two hundred years after the voyage of Joliet has  been the history of courageous, persistent, and successful exploration,  wherein the track of the explorer, instantly serving as a trail for the  pioneer, has speedily broadened into the wagon-road of invading  immigrants.    Explorations and journeys of such an extent as in other and older lands  would have excited praise and merited reward have been so frequent in  this continent as to pass almost unnoticed. Hence the scope of this  modest volume is necessarily confined to explorations of great  importance or peculiar interest, and when made by men of American birth  who are no longer living.    In deference to the author's advisers, two exceptions have been made--Du  Chaillu and Stanley, Americans by adoption--otherwise African  exploration, so wondrously successful in this generation and so fruitful  in its results, would have been unrepresented. Again, the unparalleled  growth and progress of our American republic owes no small debt to the  wealth of physical vigor and strong intellectuality contributed by its  sturdy emigrants. These men, American in idea, purpose, and action,  whose manhood outgrew the slow evolution of freedom in their natal  country, merit recognition. What thousands of other naturalized citizens  have industrially wrought of the wonderful and great in this country,  these selected representatives have equalled in African exploration.    A chronological arrangement appeared best suited to these sketches,  which from Joliet to Fremont exhibit the initiation, growth, and  development of geographic discovery in the interior and western portions  of the United States. Since the sketches rest very largely on original  narratives some current errors at least have been avoided.    Generalization and criticism have been made always with reference to  later exploration, which necessarily enhances or diminishes the  importance of any original work.

Minor typos have been  corrected and footnotes moved to the end of the article.          PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.      The conclusion of the Fourth Volume of a periodical may be accepted as  a sign of its permanent establishment. The proprietors of the  INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE have the satisfaction of believing that, while  there has been a steady increase of sales, ever since the publication  of the first number of this work, there has likewise been as regular  an augmentation of its interest, value, and adaptation to the wants of  the reading portion of our community. While essentially an Eclectic,  relying very much for success on a reproduction of judiciously  selected and fairly acknowledged Foreign Literature, it has contained  from month to month such an amount of New Articles as justified its  claim to consideration as an Original Miscellany. And in choosing from  European publications, articles to reprint or to translate for these  pages, care has been taken not only to avoid that vein of  licentiousness in morals, and skepticism in religion, which in so  lamentable a degree characterize a large portion of the popular  literature of this age, but also to extract from foreign periodicals  that American element with which the rising importance of our country  has caused so many of them to be infused; so that, notwithstanding the  fact that more than half the contents of the INTERNATIONAL are from  the minds of Europeans, the Magazine is essentially more _American_  than any other now published.    For the future, the publishers have made arrangements that will insure  very decided and desirable improvements, which will be more fully  disclosed in the first number of the ensuing volume; eminent original  writers will be added to our list of contributors; from Germany,  France, and Great Britain, we have increased our literary resources;  and more attention will be given to the pictorial illustration of such  subjects as may be advantageously treated in engravings. Among those  authors whose contributions have appeared in the INTERNATIONAL  hitherto, we may mention:    MISS FENIMORE COOPER,  MISS ALICE CAREY,  MRS. E. OAKES SMITH,  MRS. M. E. HEWITT,  MRS. ALICE B. NEAL,  BISHOP SPENCER,  HENRY AUSTIN LAYARD,  PARKE GODWIN,  JOHN R. THOMPSON,  W. C. RICHARDS,  W. GILMORE SIMMS,  BAYARD TAYLOR,  ROBERT HENRY STODDARD,  ALFRED B. STREET,  THOMAS EWBANK,  E. W. ELLSWORTH,  G. P. R. JAMES,  DR. JOHN W. FRANCIS,  MAUNSELL B. FIELD,  DR. STARBUCK MAYO,  JOHN E. WARREN,  A. OAKEY HALL,  HORACE GREELEY,  RICHARD B. KIMBALL,  THE AUTHOR OF \"NILE NOTES,\"  THE AUTHOR OF \"HARRY FRANCO.\"  REV. J. C. RICHMOND,  REV. H. W. PARKER,  JAMES T. FIELDS,  R. S. CHILTON.    The foreign writers, from whom we have selected, need not be  enumerated; they embrace the principal living masters of literary art;  and we shall continue to avail ourselves of their new productions as  largely as justice to them and the advantage and pleasure of our  readers may seem to justify.
