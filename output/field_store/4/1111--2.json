MOZART      The composer whom we call WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART was called Wolferl  when he was a little boy.    He had a sister, MARIA ANNA, who was called NANNERL.    Nannerl was five years older than her brother. She had lessons from her  father on a kind of piano called a harpsichord.    Here is a picture of one.                     [Illustration: MOZART'S HARPSICHORD.]    When Wolferl was three years old he used to listen to Nannerl's playing.  He always watched and listened when Papa Mozart gave her a harpsichord  lesson.    Little as he was, he would often go to the harpsichord and try to pick  out tunes with his chubby fingers. His father noticed that Wolferl could  remember quite a little of the music that Nannerl was practising.    And here is a picture of Wolferl trying to reach the keys so as to play  the melody of his sister's lesson.                [Illustration: THE INFANT MOZART AT THE PIANO.]    When Wolferl was four years old he began to take lessons.    While he practised no one ever spoke to him because he was so serious  about it. If other children came to play with Nannerl he would make  music for their games and marching; playing in strict time all the  while.    Here is Nannerl's picture when she grew up to be a young lady.                        [Illustration: MOZART'S SISTER.]    Father Mozart loved both of his children deeply and often played with  them. The violin was the instrument he liked best and little Mozart had  daily lessons in his home. Here we see him playing while his sister  sings.                     [Illustration: A MOZART FAMILY TRIO.]    In this picture we see Papa Mozart, who was a very fine player on the  violin. Wolferl and Nannerl are playing the piano.           [Illustration: MOZART PLAYING WITH HIS FATHER AND SISTER.]    When Wolferl was nearly six his father took him and Nannerl on a concert  tour. Everybody wanted to hear them play and they gave many concerts.    Wolferl spent all his boyhood with his music. He went to many places to  play, even as far from Salzburg, in Austria (where he was born), as to  Paris and London.    Everywhere he went people were happy to see him and his sister and to  hear them play. And they, too, were happy to play because they loved the  music so much.    When they reached Vienna they played for the Emperor and Empress.    When Wolferl was presented to the Empress he jumped up into her lap and  kissed her.    Wolferl was always busy composing music. But he played games and had a  good time just like any other boy. When he was busy with his music,  however, he never let his thoughts go to anything else.    But we must not go too fast, for we want to see how Wolferl is growing  up.    Here is his picture when he was five years old and beside it another  when he was eight years old. Do you see his wig and sword?                        [Illustration: MOZART AT FIVE.]                        [Illustration: MOZART AT EIGHT.]    Everybody in Paris wanted to hear Wolferl play when they knew that he  had come, so they asked him to read at sight; to play the bass part to a  melody and to accompany a song without seeing the music.    People also took great delight in asking him to play on the harpsichord  with a cloth stretched over the keyboard so that he could not see the  keys.    They all went to London to play for the King. The King wanted to see for  himself how skilful little Mozart was, so he gave him pieces by Bach and  Handel to play at sight. Mozart read them off at once. Here is a fine  picture of the Mozart children when they played for the King and the  Queen.              [Illustration: MOZART AT THE COURT OF THE EMPEROR.]    It must have been very fine for a little boy of seven to play for kings  and queens. But Wolferl was not spoiled by it all. He was just a happy  hearted boy all the time.    He always made it a rule to put his mind on what he was doing and do it  the very best he knew how.    It is just as good a rule now as it was when he was alive.    It is time now that we learned the birthday of Mozart. If we think of it  every year on the 27th of January, it will be easy to remember it.    In what year was he born?    Here is another picture of Mozart in 1766. How old was he then?  (Beethoven was born four years afterward.)                        [Illustration: MOZART IN 1766.]    When anyone is always busy at one thing he soon gets a lot done. As  Wolferl grew and kept on writing music all the time he made a great many  pieces. Some were short like a song, others were long like an opera. He  wrote for the piano, the violin and the voice. And he composed operas,  symphonies and ever so many other kinds of music.    Mozart liked to be alone when he was working upon his compositions. He  used to go to a little house on the edge of Vienna and lock himself in.  The people of the city of Salzburg, in Austria, took this house long  after Mozart's death and moved it to a park where all may go to see it,  just as we in America go to see the houses of William Penn, Lincoln and  Washington.                     [Illustration: WHERE MOZART COMPOSED.]    Can you remember, without turning back, the year in which Mozart was  born?    Some other great musicians were alive at that time. And during his  lifetime some were born who became great men.    In the year when Mozart was born both Handel and Haydn were living. And  Haydn lived eighteen years after Mozart's death.    You can remember it by these lines:             |1732         The years of Haydn's life          1809|           ------------------------------------------------------                   |1756 The years of Mozart's life 1791|                   --------------------------------------    When Mozart was fourteen years old Beethoven was born. Mozart knew him  and he knew Papa Haydn also, and they were very good friends.    In our own country there lived in Mozart's lifetime Benjamin Franklin  and three Presidents of the United States--George Washington, John Adams  and Thomas Jefferson.    I wonder if Washington ever heard of Mozart?    Perhaps we can best keep all these names together by looking at this  page now and again.        1706  Benjamin Franklin was born.      1732  Washington and Haydn were born.      1736  Patrick Henry was born.      1743  Thomas Jefferson was born.      1750  Bach died.      1756  WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART was born.      1759  Handel died      1770  Beethoven was born.      1771  Walter Scott was born.      1790  Franklin died.      1791  Mozart died.      1809  Joseph Haydn died.    Isn't it fine to think of Mozart writing so much music, so many operas,  symphonies and sonatas; traveling so much, meeting so many people and  never being spoiled by it all.    While he wrote many very great pieces of music, here is something he  composed when he was five years old. He made up the pieces at the piano  and his father wrote them down note for note in a little copy book.

BOOK III.            ROMAN SCHOOL.      I have frequently heard the lovers of art express a doubt whether the  Roman School possesses the same inherent right to that distinctive  appellation as the schools of Florence, Bologna, and Venice. Those of  the latter cities were, indeed, founded by their respective citizens,  and supported through a long course of ages; while the Roman School, it  may be said, could boast only of Giulio Romano and Sacchi, and a few  others, natives of Rome, who taught, and left scholars there. The other  artists who flourished there were either natives of the cities of the  Roman state, or from other parts of Italy, some of whom established  themselves in Rome, and others, after the close of their labours there,  returned and died in their native places. But this question is, if I  mistake not, rather a dispute of words than of things, and similar to  those objections advanced by the peripatetic sophists against the modern  philosophy; insisting that they abuse the meaning of their words, and  quoting, as an example, the _vis inertiae_; as if that, which is in  itself inert, could possess the quality of force. The moderns laugh at  this difficulty, and coolly reply that, if the _vis_ displeased them,  they might substitute _natura_, or any other equivalent word; and that  it was lost time to dispute about words, and neglect things. So it may  be said in this case; they who disapprove of the designation of school,  may substitute that of academy, or any other term denoting a place where  the art of painting is professed and taught. And, as the learned  universities always derive their names from the city where they are  established, as the university of Padua or Pisa, although the professors  may be all, or in great part, from other states, so it is with the  schools of painting, to which the name of the country is always  attached, in preference to that of the master. In Vasari we do not find  this classification of schools, and Monsignor Agucchi was the first to  divide Italian art into the schools of Lombardy, Venice, Tuscany, and  Rome.[1] He has employed the term of schools after the manner of the  ancients, and has thus characterised one of them as the Roman School. He  has, perhaps, erred in placing Michel Angiolo, as well as Raphael, at  the head of this school, as posterity have assigned him his station as  chief of the school of Florence; but he has judged right in classing it  under a separate head, possessing, as it does, its own peculiar style;  and in this he has been followed by all the modern writers of art. The  characteristic feature in the Roman School has been said to consist in a  strict imitation of the works of the ancients, not only in sublimity,  but also in elegance and selection; and to this we shall add other  peculiarities, which will be noticed in their proper place. Thus, from  its propriety, or from tacit convention, the appellation of the Roman  School has been generally adopted; and, as it certainly serves to  distinguish one of the leading styles of Italian art, it becomes  necessary to employ it, in order to make ourselves clearly understood.  We cannot, indeed, allow to the Roman School so extensive a range as we  have assigned to that of Florence, in the first book; nevertheless,  every one that chooses may apply this appellation to it in a very  enlarged sense. Nor is the fact of other artists having taught, or  having given a tone to painting in the capital, any valid objection to  this term; since, in a similar manner, we find Titiano, Paolo Veronese,  and Bassano, in Venice, though all of them were strangers; but, as they  were subjects of her government, they were all termed Venetians, as that  name alike embraces those born in the city or within the dominions of  the Republic. The same may be said of the subjects of the Pope. Besides  the natives of Rome, there appeared masters from many of her subject  cities, who, teaching in Rome, followed in the steps of their  predecessors, and maintained the same principles of art. Passing over  Pier della Francesca and Pietro Vannucci, we may refer to Raffaello  himself as an example. Raffaello was born in Urbino, and was the subject  of a duke, who held his fief under the Roman see, and who, in Rome, held  the office of prefect of the city; and whose dominions, in failure of  male issue, reverted to the Pope, as the heritage of the church. Thus  Raffaello cannot be considered other than a Roman subject. To him  succeeded Giulio Romano and his scholars; who were followed by Zuccari,  and the mannerists of that time, until the art found a better style  under the direction of Baroccio, Baglione, and others. After them  flourished Sacchi and Maratta, whose successors have extended to our own  times. Restricted within these bounds, the Roman may certainly be  considered as a national school; and, if not rich in numbers, it is at  least so in point of excellence, as Raffaello in himself outweighs a  world of inferior artists.    The other painters who resided in Rome, and followed the principles of  that school, I shall neither attempt to add to, nor to subtract from the  number of its followers; adopting it as a maxim not to interfere in the  decision of disputes, alike idle and irrelevant to my subject. Still  less shall I ascribe to it those who there adopted a totally different  style, as Michelangiolo da Caravaggio, an artist whom Lombardy may lay  claim to, on account of his birth, or Venice, from his receiving his  education in that city, though he lived and wrote in Rome, and  influenced the taste of the national school there by his own example and  that of his scholars. In the same manner many other names will  occasionally occur in the history of this school: it is the duty of the  historian to mention these, and it is, at the same time, an incomparable  triumph to the Roman School, that she stands, in this manner, as the  centre of all the others; and that so many artists could not have  obtained celebrity, if they had not seen Rome, or could not have claimed  that title from the world unless they had first obtained her suffrage.    I shall not identify the limits of this school with those of the  dominions of the church, as in that case we should comprise in it the  painters of Bologna, Ferrara, and Romagna, whom I have reserved for  another volume. In my limits I shall include only the capital, and the  provinces in its immediate vicinity, as Latium, the Sabine territories,  the patrimony of the Church, Umbria, Picenum, and the state of Urbino,  the artists of which district were, for the most part, educated in Rome,  or under the eyes of Roman masters. My historical notices of them will  be principally derived from Vasari, Baglione, Passeri, and Leone  Pascoli. From these writers we have the lives of many artists who  painted in Rome, and the last named author has included in his account  his fellow countrymen of Perugia. Pascoli has not, indeed, the merits of  the three first writers; but he does not deserve the discredit thrown on  him by Ratti and Bottari, the latter of whom, in his notes to Vasari,  does not hesitate to call him a wretched writer, and unworthy of credit.  His work, indeed, on the artists of Perugia, shows that he  indiscriminately copied what he found in others, whether good or bad;  and to the vulgar traditions of the early artists he paid more than due  attention. But his other work, on the history of the modern painters,  sculptors, and architects, is a book of authority. In every branch of  history much credit is attached to the accounts of contemporary writers,  particularly if they were acquaintances or friends of the persons of  whom they"]]]
