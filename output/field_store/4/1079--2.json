That struggle lasted  over a period of some years, and to do justice to its numerous incidents  in the course of a single volume would have left no space whatever  available for the telling of a story. It was divided into two distinct  epochs. In the first the natives of the north of the islands fought for  their independence and their right to have a king, and be governed by  their own laws. Nothing could exceed the courage with which they  struggled for these ends, and it needed a very strong force of British  troops to storm their pahs or fortified camps, and overcome their  resistance. The second epoch embraces the struggle brought about by the  conversion of a portion of the tribes to the fanatical belief called the  Pai Marire (literally \"good and peaceful\"), whose votaries were  generally known as the Hau-Haus. During the earlier war the natives  behaved with great moderation, and there were but few cases of the  murder of outlying settlers. The slaying of all whites was, however, the  leading feature of the Hau-Hau religion, and many cold-blooded  massacres occurred during the struggle. The British troops had been for  the most part withdrawn before the commencement of the Hau-Hau troubles,  and the war was carried on by bodies of constabulary raised by the  colonists, and with the aid of tribes that remained friendly to us. The  massacre of Poverty Bay, which forms the leading feature of my story,  and the events that followed it, are all strictly in accordance with  facts.    G.A. HENTY          CONTENTS.

CHAPTER I.    A HOME BROKEN UP.      \"Well, mother, one thing is certain--something has got to be done. It is  no use crying over spilt milk, that I can see. It is a horribly bad  business, but grieving over it won't make it any better. What one has  got to do is to decide on some plan or other, and then set to work to  carry it out.\"    The speaker, Wilfrid Renshaw, was a boy between fifteen and sixteen  years old. He was standing with his back to an empty fireplace, his feet  well apart, his hands deep in his pockets. He was rather short for his  age, but very squarely built. His hair was dark, cut rather short, and  so ruffled over his head that there were no signs of a parting; his  eyebrows were heavy, his eyes bright but rather deeply set; his chin was  square and his jaw heavy; his nose was a little upturned, and this  together with his eyes gave a merry expression to a face that would  otherwise have been heavy and stern.    At school Wilfrid Renshaw had been regarded as rather a queer fellow.  He was full of quiet fun, and saw a humorous side in everything. He did  not take a very leading part in the various school sports, though there  was a general idea that if Renshaw only chose to exert himself he could  excel in any of them. In point of actual strength, although there were  several boys in the school older than himself, it was generally admitted  that he was by far the strongest there. But he always went his own way  and always knew his own mind, and when he had once given his decision  every one knew that it was of no use attempting to alter it; indeed, his  reputation for obstinacy was so great that when he had once said \"I  won't\" or \"I will,\" no one ever attempted to argue with him.    He was given to long walks and to collecting insects or flowers. He  could never be persuaded to make one of the cricket eleven; but in  winter, when there was little scope for his favourite pursuit, he threw  himself into football; and although he absolutely refused to accept the  captaincy when unanimously elected to that honour, he was considered by  far the most valuable member of the team. He was scarcely popular among  the boys of his own age; for although his fun and general good temper  were appreciated by them, his determination to go his own way, and his  entire disregard for the opinion of others, caused him to be considered  an unsociable sort of fellow, an impression increased by the fact that  he had no particular chums.    Among the smaller boys he was greatly liked. He would never allow any  bullying when he was present; and although his interference was often  resented by some of the elders, his reputation for strength and  obstinacy was so great that he had never been called upon to take active  measures to support his decisively expressed opinions. His father lived  in a pretty house a quarter of a mile outside Reading; and as Wilfrid  attended the grammar-school there, he was much more free to indulge his  own tastes and go his own way than if he had been in a boarding-school.  His chief companion in his rambles was his only sister Marion, who was a  year his senior, although strangers would not have taken her to be so,  either from her appearance or manner. She had an active lithe figure,  and was able to keep up with him even during his longest excursions.  They were in fact great chums and allies, and Marion would have  indignantly scouted the idea had anyone suggested to her that her  brother was either obstinate or unsociable.    Mr. Renshaw had been intended for the bar, and had indeed been called to  that profession; but shortly afterwards he came into a fortune at the  death of his father, and at once abandoned all idea of practising. After  travelling for a few years on the Continent and in the East, he married  and settled down near Reading. His time was for the most part devoted to  archaeology. He had a rare collection of ancient British, Saxon, and  Norman arms, ornaments, and remains of all sorts; had written several  books on the antiquities of Berkshire and Oxfordshire; was an authority  upon tumuli and stone weapons; and was regarded by his acquaintances as  a man of much learning.    The management of the house and children, and indeed of all affairs  unconnected with his favourite hobby, he left to his wife, who was,  fortunately for him, a clear-headed and sensible woman. Mr. Renshaw was,  in fact, an eminently impractical man, weak and easy in disposition,  averse to exertion of any kind, and without a shadow of the decision of  character that distinguished his son.

THE DEPARTURE FROM THE FOREST.          Where the light laughs in through the tree-tops        And sports with the tangled glade,      In the depths of an Afric forest        My earliest scenes were laid.    [Illustration]        In a bower that was merry with smilax        From the grimace of no-where, I woke      I was born on the first day of April        And they called me a jungle joke.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        And the voices of birds were about me--        And the beat and the flutter of wing;      While morning returned at the trumpet        Of Tusky, our elephant king.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        My nurse was a crooning old beldame        Who gazed in the palms of my hands      And vowed I was destined to travel        In many and marvellous lands.    [Illustration]        But little I heeded her croaking,        For I gamboled the whole day long,      And swung by my tail from the tree-top,        Or joined in the jungle song.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE SONG OF THE JUNGLE.          _The Elephant:_            Oh, I am the lord of the forest and plain!        _The Lion, Tigers, etc.:_            And we are the beasts that acknowledge your reign!        _The Birds:_            And we are the minstrels that come at your call!        _The Monkeys:_            And we are the jesters that laugh at you all!    [Illustration]        _Chorus, All--_        _Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!_        _The tribes of the jungle are we--_      _Our home is the darksome wilderness_        _That never a man shall see._        _The Elephant:_            Oh, the jungle was meant and was made for my will!        _The Lions, Tigers, etc.:_            For the sport of the chase and the zest of the kill!        _The Birds:_            For the beating of wings and the echo of song!        _The Monkeys:_            For gambol and grimace the whole season long!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        _Chorus, All:_        _Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Oh, yes!_        _For all of the tribes that be_      _With homes in the tangled wilderness_        _That never a man shall see._    [Illustration]        But, alas, for the boasts of the jungle!        The men came among us one day,      And one with a box that made music        Enticed foolish monkeys away.        The birds and the beasts of the forest        Were mute at the marvellous song,      But the monkeys crept out of the tree-tops--        An eager and wondering throng.    [Illustration]        The birds and the beasts of the forest        Kept hidden and silent that day,      But the monkey-folk formed a procession        And followed the minstrel away.        And thus did we give up the forest        To dwell with our brothers, the men--      Farewell to the beautiful jungle!        'Twas long ere I saw it again!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    PART SECOND.    THE WAYS OF MEN.          Then away to a far distant country        On a drift that they said was a ship,      And I studied the ways of my master        And profited much by the trip.        And we sailed to his home in fair Naples,        Where I studied the language of men,      And I sat on a bench with his children,        But soon we went sailing again.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        And I made some nice friends on the voyage,        And engaged in a pretty romance.      I charmed all the ladies by climbing,        And one of them taught me to dance.    [Illustration]        Yet often I longed for the jungle--        Its song and the rustle of wing--      And sometimes at night in my slumber        I talked with our elephant king.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        One morning my master awoke me,        And, dressed in a gaudy new suit,      I beheld the New World in the sunlight,        And lifted my hat in salute.        And then began troubles and trials--        Through the streets by a string I was led;      Toiling hard all the day for my master,        Yet oft going hungry to bed.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        But he sold me at last to a circus        And my lot became easier then,      So I gave many moments of leisure        To acquiring the habits of men.        I copied their manners and customs        I made of each fashion a note;      And the children admired my performance        And the ladies the cut of my coat.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        By and by I was sold to a banker        Who was charmed with my ball-rolling feat,      And arrayed in a Fauntleroy costume        I passed all my time on the street.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        But alas for my plans of the future!        He died without leaving a cent,      And I had to go out to hard labor        To pay for my victuals and rent;        Till I met with a gentleman's valet        Who was like me in manner and face,      And I told him some stories that pleased him        And bribed him to give me his place.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        Then I started to serve my new master--        A bachelor cynic was he,      Who quickly saw through the deception        And made a proposal to me.        Said he: \"You're a monkey, you rascal,        And an excellent type of the brood;      Let's play a good joke on society        By passing you off as a dude.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        So he took me at first to his barber,        Who shaved me and shortened my hair,      And the last tangled trace of the jungle        Was gone when I rose from his chair.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        And then to his tailor and hatter--        His hosier and all of the rest,      Till at night I was changed from a monkey        To a chappie most stylishly dressed.        And standing alone and reflecting        I thought of the why and the how,      And I wondered what Tusky was doing        And what would the jungle say, now.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    PART THIRD.    THE BUTTERFLY WHIRL.        It was then for the triumphs of conquest!        Oh, then for the life of the swell!      I dwelt like a lord with my patron        In a suite of a gilded hotel.        And we went out to plays and to dinners--        On the ladies he took me to call--      And once we received invitations        To a beautiful fancy-dress ball.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        'Twas a famous affair and it won me,        With its titter and tinsel and tune,      For it carried me back to the jungle        And the monkey-dance under the moon.        Then I mingled with other diversions.        I learned how to paint and to ride;      I cut a great figure at polo--        The science of golfing I tried.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        As a wheelman I soon became famous        And made a great score on the track--      I was known as the king of the scorchers,        With the typical bicycle back.        Then a girl who was youthful and silly        Made love to me just for a lark,      And came with an elegant turnout        And took me to drive in the park.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        And I took her out boating next morning,        For the face of my charmer was fair;      It carried me back to the jungle--        To the flow'rs that were blossoming there.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        But soon, in the midst of my pleasure,        In the glow of a roseate dream,      The boat struck a rock and tipped over        And tumbled us both in the stream.        Then, ho, for the skill of the jungle!        The deftness of foot and of hand!      For I hung from a limb and I saved her        And drew her at last to the strand.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        And then to her home I went proudly        To claim the fair maid for my own,      But her father demanded a title,        And hardened his heart like a stone.        And now came the death of my patron,        That left me alone in the strife,      And yearning once more for the jungle,        I turned to political life.    [Illustration]          PART FOURTH.    THE RETURN PATH.          Then I studied a week to gain knowledge,        And waded through volumes of stuff,      And I found that the only requirements        Were cunning and blarney and bluff.        And these I had brought from the jungle--        Inherited straight from my race--      With a gift for political music        And a truly political face.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        Thus feeling at home in my labors,        My plan was successful, of course,      And when they came round with appointments        They gave me a job on \"the force.\"        And such was my skill as a roundsman,        And talent in keeping the peace,      That I rose in a year to be Captain,        And then to be Chief of Police!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        And then, as my years were advancing,        So great was their honor and trust,      That they twined me a chaplet of laurel        And sculptured in marble my bust.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]        Yet often I dreamed of the jungle--        Its song and the rustle of wing--      And sometimes still talked in my slumber        With Tusky, our elephant king.        When, lo, my political party,        That now was in power and supreme,      Conferred a most noble appointment        That realized all of my dream. "]]]
