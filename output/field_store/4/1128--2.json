Pass  the needle and thread through the center of the book, leaving an end  extend outside, then through to the outside, about 2 inches from the  center; then from the outside to inside 2 inches from the center at the  other end of the book, bringing the thread finally again through the  center, and tie the two ends in a knot, one each side of the cord on the  outside.                       THEO. PRESSER CO., Pub's., Phila., Pa.                                    HOW TO USE THIS BOOK      This book is one of a series known as THE CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF THE GREAT  MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of \"Pictures from the Lives  of the Great Composers for Children,\" \"Music Talks with Children,\"  \"First Studies in Music Biography,\" and others.    The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the  child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place  throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as  will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to  cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the  corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around  each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.    After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the  book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the  great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous  pages.    The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the  cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's  own book.    This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting  task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to  the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth  while.                       *       *       *       *       *    This series of The Child's Own Book of the Great Musicians includes at  present a book on each of the following:                Bach                                 Mendelssohn              Beethoven                            Mozart              Chopin                               Schubert              Grieg                                Schumann              Handel                               Verdi              Haydn                                Wagner              Liszt                             Printed in the U.S.A.

Of course, one is not born a great composer. He has to become  that. So, at the moment this story begins there is, within this house, a  little boy quite like any other boy. He loved to play and to make a  noise and to have a good time. But most of all--what do you think he  loved?    A hand organ.                              [Illustration: No. 2                            VERDI'S BIRTHPLACE]    Whenever the organ man came into the village of Roncole, in Italy (where  Verdi was born, October 10, 1813), he could not be kept indoors. But he  followed the wonderful organ and the wonderful man who played it, all  day long, as happy as he could be.    When Giuseppe was seven years old his father, though only a poor  innkeeper, bought him a spinet, a sort of small piano. So faithfully did  the little boy practise that the spinet was soon quite worn out and new  jacks, or hammers, had to be made for it. This was done by Stephen  Cavaletti, who wrote a message on one of the jacks telling that he made  them anew and covered them with leather, and fixed the pedal, doing all  for nothing, because the little boy, Giuseppe Verdi, showed such  willingness to practise and to learn. Thus the good Stephen thought this  was pay enough.    Here is a picture of the little piano. In Verdi's language (Italian) it  is called a spinetta.                              [Illustration: No. 3                            VERDI'S SPINET]    It was on this spinet that the little boy discovered one day a wonderful  chord, for so it seemed to him. It was this:                             [Illustration: No. 4]    The tones delighted him and he pressed the keys over and over again to  drink them in. But the next day when he sought again the keys which made  the lovely sound, he could not find them. This made him so impatient  and finally so curious that he began to break the spinet to pieces with  a hammer. Fortunately the noise he made brought his father into the room  and the spinet was saved.    When Giuseppe was making his first attempt to find beautiful chords on  the spinet he was, as we have said, seven years old. That was in 1820.    When he was ten years old (what year was that?) Giuseppe became organist  at the old church of Roncole. Truly a little boy for so great a  position! One day he scratched his name on the woodwork. Here is a  picture of the organ:                              [Illustration: No. 5                            ORGAN AT RONCOLE]    Here is the scratching of his name:                             [Illustration: No. 6]    And here is the way he wrote his name, as a man:                             [Illustration: No. 7]    Then there came the question of education--of reading, writing, spelling  and arithmetic--for this music-loving boy. The Verdis wanted Giuseppe to  grow up as he should; so it was arranged for him to go to school in the  neighboring town of Busseto. A cobbler lived there who was a friend of  the family, and with him Giuseppe went to live, having board, lodging  and tuition at the school, and all for six cents a day.    Giuseppe still played the organ at Roncole, going thither afoot every  Sunday morning and back after nightfall.    He must have been a weary little boy after the day's music-making at the  church. One Sunday night when it was dark and he was too weary to notice  where he was going, he fell into a ditch, from which he was rescued by  an old woman, who, hearing his call for help, pulled the half-frozen boy  out of the water.    Our little hero had another talent besides music. He knew how to win the  friendship of people. So at Busseto a man named Barezzi offered to take  him into his business. He sold spices, drugs and perfumes. But besides  this he played the flute in the church. At his house Giuseppe heard lots  of good music, for the town orchestra rehearsed there. Here is a picture  of Giuseppe's friend:                             [Illustration: No. 8                           BAREZZI]    Then Giuseppe made another friend who gave him a wonderful bit of  advice. HE URGED HIM TO BECOME A COMPOSER!    Better still he helped the boy in every way he could until he was  sixteen years old. By that time our little Giuseppe was grown to be  quite a man. His friend, whose name was Ferdinando Provesi, was proud of  him, for already he was becoming a master. He played the cathedral organ  at times; he conducted the Philharmonic Orchestra; he led its  rehearsals, and he composed music for its concerts.                             [Illustration: No. 9                           PROVESI]    So you see--all the wonderful operas that were to come were already on  the way!    It has been written that Provesi was the first person to see and  understand Verdi's real genius. The boy worked hard and advanced so  rapidly that it was soon necessary for him to go to a larger city for  lessons.    Now a good friend is always a good friend, so it is pleasing to tell  that Barezzi sent Giuseppe to Milan, the lovely city of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/353"],[0,"In Flanders Fields, and Other Poems (#1)"],[1,"FLANDERS FIELDS    by John McCrae    [Canadian Poet, 1872-1918]      With an Essay in Character by Sir Andrew Macphail      [This text is taken from the New York edition of 1919.]      [Note on text: Italicized stanzas are indented 5 spaces.

That day of battle in the dusty heat             We lay and heard the bullets swish and sing            Like scythes amid the over-ripened wheat,             And we the harvest of their garnering.

Not we, we swear             By these our wounds; this trench upon the hill            Where all the shell-strewn earth is seamed and bare,             Was ours to keep; and lo! we have it still.              We might have yielded, even we, but death             Came for our helper; like a sudden flood            The crashing darkness fell; our painful breath             We drew with gasps amid the choking blood.              The roar fell faint and farther off, and soon             Sank to a foolish humming in our ears,            Like crickets in the long, hot afternoon             Among the wheat fields of the olden years.              Before our eyes a boundless wall of red             Shot through by sudden streaks of jagged pain!            Then a slow-gathering darkness overhead             And rest came on us like a quiet rain.              Not we the conquered!  Not to us the shame,             Who hold our earthen ramparts, nor shall cease            To hold them ever; victors we, who came             In that fierce moment to our honoured peace.          The Captain              1797                     _Here all the day she swings from tide to tide,                  Here all night long she tugs a rusted chain,                 A masterless hulk that was a ship of pride,                  Yet unashamed:  her memories remain._              It was Nelson in the 'Captain', Cape St. Vincent far alee,             With the 'Vanguard' leading s'uth'ard in the haze --            Little Jervis and the Spaniards and the fight that was to be,            Twenty-seven Spanish battleships, great bullies of the sea,             And the 'Captain' there to find her day of days.              Right into them the 'Vanguard' leads, but with a sudden tack             The Spaniards double swiftly on their trail;            Now Jervis overshoots his mark, like some too eager pack,            He will not overtake them, haste he e'er so greatly back,             But Nelson and the 'Captain' will not fail.              Like a tigress on her quarry leaps the 'Captain' from her place,             To lie across the fleeing squadron's way:            Heavy odds and heavy onslaught, gun to gun and face to face,            Win the ship a name of glory, win the men a death of grace,             For a little hold the Spanish fleet in play.
