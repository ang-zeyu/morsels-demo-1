[Illustration]    Nature Series    ON THE ORIGIN AND METAMORPHOSES OF INSECTS    BY    Sir John Lubbock, Bart., M.P., F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D.    Principal of the London Working Men's College; President of the London  Chamber of Commerce; and Vice-Chairman of the London County Council    With Numerous Illustrations                London Macmillan and Co. and New York 1890    The Right of Translation and Reproduction is Reserved    Richard Clay and Sons, Limited, London and Bungay.    First Edition 1873. Reprinted 1874. New Edition 1890.          PREFACE.      For some years, much of my leisure time has been devoted to the study of  the anatomy, development, and habits of the Annulosa, and especially of  Insects, on which subjects I have published various memoirs, chiefly in  the Transactions of the Royal, Linnaean, and Entomological Societies: of  these papers I subjoin a list. Although the details, of which these  memoirs necessarily for the most part consist, offer little interest,  excepting to those persons who are specially devoted to Entomology,  still there are portions which, having reference to the nature of  metamorphoses and to the origin of insects, are of a more general  character. I have also briefly referred to these questions in a  Monograph of the Collembola and Thysanura, recently published by the Ray  Society, and in the Opening Address to the Biological Section of the  British Association at Brighton in 1872. Under these circumstances, it  has been suggested to me that a small volume, containing, at somewhat  greater length, in a more accessible form, and with the advantage of  illustrations, the conclusions to which I have been led on this  interesting subject, might not be altogether without interest to the  general reader. The result, which has already appeared in the pages of  _Nature_, is now submitted to the public, with some additions. I am well  aware that it has no pretence to be in any sense a complete treatise;  that the subject itself is one as to which our knowledge is still very  incomplete, and on which the highest authorities are much divided in  opinion. Whatever differences of opinion, however, there may be as to  the views here put forward, the facts on which they are based will, I  believe, be found correct. On this point I speak with the more  confidence, on account of the valuable assistance I have received from  many friends: to Mr. and Mrs. Busk and Dr. Hooker I am especially  indebted.

Nature herself is the teacher who rouses him from his bed with an  outburst of song under the window and sets his sleepy brain to  wondering whether it was a robin's clear, ringing call that startled  him from his dreams, or the chipping sparrow's wiry tremulo, or the  gushing little wren's tripping cadenza. Interest in the birds trains  the ear quite unconsciously. A keen, intelligent listener is rare,  even among grown-ups, but a child who is becoming acquainted with the  birds about him hears every sound and puzzles out its meaning with a  cleverness that amazes those with ears who hear not. He responds to  the first alarm note from the nesting blue birds in the orchard and  dashes out of the house to chase away a prowling cat. He knows from  {vi} afar the distress caws of a company of crows and away he goes to  be sure that their persecutor is a hawk. A faint tattoo in the woods  sends him climbing up a tall straight tree with the confident  expectation of finding a woodpecker's nest within the hole in its  side.    While training his ears, Nature is also training every muscle in his  body, sending him on long tramps across the fields in pursuit of a new  bird to be identified, making him run and jump fences and wade brooks  and climb trees with the zest that produces an appetite like a  saw-mill's and deep sleep at the close of a happy day.    When President Roosevelt was a boy he was far from strong, and his  anxious father and mother naturally encouraged every interest that he  showed in out-of-door pleasures. Among these, perhaps the keenest that  he had was in birds. He knew the haunts of every species within a wide  radius of his home and made a large collection of eggs and skins that  he presented to the Smithsonian Museum when he could no longer endure  the evidences of his \"youthful indiscretion,\" as he termed the  collector's mania. But those bird hunts that had kept him happily  employed in the open air all day long, helped to make him the strong,  manly man he is, whose wonderful physical endurance is not the least  factor of his greatness. No one abhors the killing of birds and the  {vii} robbing of nests more than he; few men, not specialists, know so  much about bird life.    Nature, the best teacher of us all, trains the child's eyes through  study of the birds to quickness and precision, which are the first  requisites for all intelligent observation in every field of  knowledge. I know boys who can name a flock of ducks when they are  mere specks twinkling in their rapid rush across the autumn sky; and  girls who instantly recognise a goldfinch by its waving flight above  the garden. The white band across the end of the kingbird's tail leads  to his identification the minute some sharp young eyes perceive it. At  a considerable distance, a little girl I know distinguished a  white-eyed from a red-eyed vireo, not by the colour of the iris of  either bird's eye, but by the yellowish white bars on the white-eyed  vireo's wings which she had noticed at a glance. Another girl named  the yellow-billed cuckoo, almost hidden among the shrubbery, by the  white thumb-nail spots on the quills of his outspread tail where it  protruded for a second from a mass of leaves. A little urchin from the  New York City slums was the first to point out to his teacher, who had  lived twenty years on a farm, the faint reddish streaks on the breast  of a yellow warbler in Central Park. Many there are who have eyes and  see not.    What does the study of birds do for the {viii} imagination, that high  power possessed by humans alone, that lifts them upward step by step  into new realms of discovery and joy? If the thought of a tiny  hummingbird, a mere atom in the universe, migrating from New England  to Central America will not stimulate a child's imagination, then all  the tales of fairies and giants and beautiful princesses and wicked  witches will not cause his sluggish fancy to roam. Poetry and music,  too, would fail to stir it out of the deadly commonplace.    Interest in bird life exercises the sympathies. The child reflects  something of the joy of the oriole whose ecstasy of song from the elm  on the lawn tells the whereabouts of a dangling \"cup of felt\" with its  deeply hidden treasures. He takes to heart the tragedy of a robin's  mud-plastered nest in the apple tree that was washed apart by a storm,  and experiences something akin to remorse when he takes a mother bird  from the jaws of his pet cat. He listens for the return of the  bluebirds to the starch-box home he made for them on top of the grape  arbour and is strangely excited and happy that bleak day in March when  they re-appear. It is nature sympathy, the growth of the heart, not  nature study, the training of the brain, that does most for us.
