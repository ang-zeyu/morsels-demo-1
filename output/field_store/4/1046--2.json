LYNCH      INTRODUCTION    According to the most recent review of the Mexican amphibian fauna  (Smith and Taylor, 1948), six genera of leptodactylid frogs occur in  Mexico. One other genus, _Pleurodema_, occurs in Lower Central America.  Smith and Taylor recognized one species of _Engystomops_, 28 of  _Eleutherodactylus_, three of _Leptodactylus_, eight of  _Microbatrachylus_, 12 of _Syrrhophus_, and five of _Tomodactylus_.  Subsequent to the publication of their checklist of the Mexican  amphibia (1948), numerous taxonomic changes have been proposed. Many  species of _Eleutherodactylus_ have been added to the fauna, either  through the extension of their recorded ranges into Mexico from  Guatemala or by the recognition of species unknown in 1948, whereas  some nominal species have been synonymized. _Microbatrachylus_ has been  regarded as synonymous with _Eleutherodactylus_ (Lynch, 1965); four  species of _Microbatrachylus_ currently are regarded as valid  (Duellman, 1961, Lynch, 1965). _Syrrhophus_ was revised in part by  Duellman (1958) and Firschein (1954), and a species of _Tomodactylus_  transferred to _Syrrhophus_ by Dixon (1957), who redefined  _Tomodactylus_ and added more species to the genus.    Since beginning my studies of the Mexican leptodactylids in 1962, I  have become acutely aware of difficulties involved in defining the  genera. A revision of _Eleutherodactylus_ and a review of _Syrrhophus_  are nearing completion, but prior to their publication it is desirable  to redefine the genera of the Mexican leptodactylids, and in so doing  recognize an heretofore unnamed genus. The definitions of  _Eleutherodactylus_ and _Leptodactylus_ may need to be altered in the  future, since both are widespread in South America and occur in the  West Indies. Their definitions as given here are as precise as present  knowledge permits. _Syrrhophus_ and _Tomodactylus_ are small  assemblages that occur only in southwestern United States, Mexico, and  Guatemala.    Taylor (1952) synonymized _Engystomops_ with _Eupemphix_ which,  although related, should be regarded as generically distinct (Gallardo,  1965). Perhaps the most conservative classification is that of Myers  (1962) who, without published evidence, combined _Eleutherodactylus_,  _Syrrhophus_, and the South American _Lithodytes_ in a single genus.    The major problem for students working with the Mexican leptodactylids  has not been the separation of _Engystomops_ or _Leptodactylus_ from  other genera but the separation and definition of the eleutherodactyline  frogs currently placed in three genera, _Eleutherodactylus_,  _Syrrhophus_, and _Tomodactylus_. As will be shown in this paper, these  are more conveniently placed in four genera. Once a fourth genus is  recognized, certain phylogenetic problems disappear and a reasonable  zoogeographic interpretation is possible for Middle American  leptodactylid distribution.          ANALYSIS OF CHARACTERS      In Mexico and northern Central America approximately 55 species of  eleutherodactyline frogs (_Eleutherodactylus_, _Syrrhophus_, and  _Tomodactylus_) are known. Four genera can be recognized on the basis  of the nature of inguinal glands, morphology of the hands and feet, and  certain osteological features.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. _Tomodactylus angustidigitorum_ (UMMZ 114305,  x 4.5) illustrating the lumbo-inguinal gland typical of members of the  genus. From a kodachrome by Wm. E. Duellman.]      Glands    Leptodactylids have a variety of glands that have been used as generic  characters. Smith and Taylor (1948) regarded the so-called inguinal  gland as a generic character in Mexican eleutherodaycty-lines. Lynch  (1965) showed that _Eleutherodactylus_ and _Microbatrachylus_ cannot  be separated by the nature of the gland or the condition of the  prevomers (dentate or not). _Syrrhophus_ and _Tomodactylus_, as defined  by Smith and Taylor (1948), are not generically distinct because of  overlap in the condition of the prevomers and in the development of the  gland. Firschein (1954) stated that _Syrrhophus_ differed from  _Tomodactylus_ by having an axillary gland, but it is now known that  one species of _Syrrhophus_ lacks the gland.    The inguinal glands of _Eleutherodactylus_ and _Syrrhophus_, if  present, are diffuse, irregular in outline, and generally not  prominent; in _Tomodactylus_ the gland is higher on the body (a  lumbo-inguinal gland), compact, oval in outline, and prominent (Fig.  1). Axillary glands occur in most _Syrrhophus_ but are not known in  _Tomodactylus_ or _Eleutherodactylus_.      Hands and feet    The tips of the digits are laterally expanded in most  _Eleutherodactylus_, _Syrrhophus_, and _Tomodactylus_. Two species  of _Eleutherodactylus_ (_augusti_ and _tarahumarensis_) and two  _Tomodactylus_ (_angustidigitorum_ and _grandis_) lack any expansion  of the digital tips. All but two of the species of eleutherodactyline  frogs (_E. augusti_ and _E. tarahumarensis_) have a transverse groove  across the tips of the digits (Fig. 2).    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Palmar views of the hands and lateral views of  the tip of the third digits of _Eleutherodactylus alfredi_ (left, KU  93994, x 5) and _Hylactophryne augusti_ (right, KU 102594, x 3).]    Supernumerary tubercles rarely are present on the feet of  _Eleutherodactylus_, but are present and numerous in every species of  _Syrrhophus_, _Tomodactylus_, and in the members of the _augusti_ group  of _Eleutherodactylus_ (Fig. 3). The tubercles are small and numerous  in _Syrrhophus_ and larger in _Tomodactylus_ and the _Eleutherodactylus  augusti_ group. Most species of _Eleutherodactylus_ have no plantar  supernumerary tubercles; a few species have such tubercles, which never  extend between the metatarsal tubercles as in _Syrrhophus_ and  _Tomodactylus_.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Plantar views of feet of _Eleutherodactylus  alfredi_ (left, KU 93994, x 4.5), _Syrrhophus pipilans nebulosus_  (middle, KU 58900, x 7.5), and _Hylactophryne augusti_ (right, KU  102594, x 3) showing differences in size and arrangement of  supernumerary tubercles.]    Tarsal folds and tubercles are lacking in _Syrrhophus_, _Tomodactylus_,  and the _augusti_ group of _Eleutherodactylus_. Several species of  _Eleutherodactylus_ lack tarsal folds and tubercles, but in nearly  every species group, one or more species possess either an inner tarsal  fold, inner tarsal tubercle(s), or outer tarsal tubercles.    The terminal phalanges of _Syrrhophus_, _Tomodactylus_, and all  _Eleutherodactylus_ (except the frogs of the _augusti_ group) are  distinctly T-shaped. In the latter, the bones are knob-shaped distally  (Fig. 4). T-shaped terminal phalanges also are present in _Lithodytes_  and _Trachyphrynus_ but not in other leptodactylid genera. At least one  species of _Eupsophus_ (_E. quixensis_) has terminal phalanges that  resemble those of the _Eleutherodactylus augusti_ group. Several  species of _Eleutherodactylus_, _Syrrhophus_, and _Tomodactylus_ with  slender fingers have T-shaped terminal phalanges although the terminal  dilations proportionately are only scarcely wider than the finger tips  in the _Eleutherodactylus augusti_ group. The presence of a terminal  groove at the tip of the finger is an external indicator of the  T-shaped terminal phalanges.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Terminal phalanges of four leptodactylid frogs  (all x 13.5). (a) _Eleutherodactylus mexicanus_, KU 55593; (b)  _Eupsophus roseus_, KU 84731; (c) _Eupsophus quixensis_, UIMNH 59643;  and (d) _Hylactophryne augusti_, KU 56192.]      Skull    All Mexican eleutherodactyline frogs have quadratojugal-maxillary  articulations, completely roofed skulls in adults, median contact of  the nasals, separated occipital condyles, and large prevomers. The  premaxillae of all species are visible when the skulls are viewed from  directly above. The pterygoid lacks a medioventral flange and does not  meet the palatine. In no species is the anterior arm of the squamosal  in contact with the maxillary. Of the numerous species examined (30  _Eleutherodactylus_, four _Syrrhophus_, and four _Tomodactylus_), the  species in the _Eleutherodactylus augusti_ group are unique in having a  sphenethmoid with a blunt anterior edge.      Pectoral Girdle    All species have large cartilaginous plates in the pectoral girdles;  none possesses a bony style. No divergent modifications of the clavicle  and coracoid bones are known in the family.

I.    The following Dog Stories are taken from the pages of the _Spectator_,  with the permission of the editors and proprietors. It was suggested to  me by Mr. Fisher Unwin that the many strange and pleasant stories of  dogs which from time to time are sent to the _Spectator_ by its  correspondents would, if put together, form a volume of no little  entertainment for all who love dogs, or are interested in stories of  animal intelligence. Up till now the _Spectator_ dog stories, after the  week of their publication, have practically been inaccessible to the  general reader; for he is a bold man who will attack a bound volume of a  newspaper in search of amusement. Though I at once agreed that the  suggested book would be a very readable one, and likely to please  dog-lovers all the world over, I did not, till the selection was nearly  made, realise how much the stories gain by being grouped together. A  single story of a clever dog may amuse, but it is liable to be put aside  as an accident, a coincidence, a purely exceptional circumstance which  proves nothing. If, however, instead of a single story we have half a  dozen illustrating the same form of intelligence, the value of the  evidence is enormously increased, and a collection of dog stories may  become of very great value in determining such questions as the power of  dogs to act on reason as well as on instinct, or their ability to  understand human language. The solution of these problems is, I cannot  help thinking, materially advanced by the stories in the present book.  Take, again, the group of stories which I have labelled Purchasing Dogs.  One sample of this kind might, as I have noted above, be put off as a  case of imperfect observation, or as a curious coincidence; but when we  get a whole group of stories it becomes very difficult to doubt that  dogs may learn the first principles of the science of exchange. The  Italian dog (page 59) which did the narrator a service by fetching him  cigars, demanded payment in the shape of a penny, and then used that  penny by exchanging it for a loaf, was far advanced in the practice of  Political Economy. He not only understood and acted on an implied  contract, but realised the great fact at the back of the currency. \"What  are guineas,\" said Horne Tooke, \"but tickets for sheep and oxen!\" The  Italian dog did not, like a savage, say, \"What is the use of copper to  me, I cannot eat it?\" Instead, he perceived that the piece of copper was  a ticket for bread. It should be noted too that this dog, the dog called  Hardy (page 57) and others, were able to distinguish between the pieces  of copper given them. Again, the Glasgow story (page 53) shows that a  dog can learn to realise that a halfpenny will buy not merely one thing  but several things--in fact, that the great advantage of exchange by  currency over barter is that it gives you a choice. While on the subject  of purchasing dogs, it is curious to reflect how very little is wanted  to convert the dog that is able to purchase into a free agent. If a dog  can exchange his faculty for cigar carrying or his tricks against  half-pence, why should he not exchange useful services, such as guarding  a house or herding sheep, and so become self-supporting? Imagine a  collie paid by the day, and, when his work was over, receiving twopence  and going off to buy his supper. But the vista opened is too  far-reaching. One sees down it dogs paid by the hour and by the piece,  and then dogs asking for better pay and shorter hours, and, finally,  dogs on strike, and dog \"black-legs,\" or \"free dogs.\"      II.    A word should be said as to the authenticity of the stories in the  present volume. It is a matter of common form for the evening newspapers  to talk of the _Spectator_ dog stories as hoaxes, and to refer in their  playful, way to \"another _Spectator_ dog.\" It might not then unnaturally  have been supposed that a person undertaking to edit and reprint these  stories would have found a considerable number that showed signs of  being hoaxes. I may confess, indeed, that I set out with the notion of  forming a sort of Appendix to the present work, which should be headed  \"Ben Trovato,\" in which should be inserted stories which were too  curious and amusing to be left out altogether, but which, on the other  hand, were what the Americans call a little \"too tall\" to be accepted as  genuine. The result of my plan was unexpected. Though I found many  stories in which the inferences seemed strained or mistaken, and others  which contained indications of exaggeration, I could find but two  stories which could reasonably be declared as only suitable for a \"Ben  Trovato.\" I therefore suppressed my heading. The truth is that the  animal stories are much more carefully sifted at the _Spectator_ office  than our witty critics and contemporaries will admit. No stories are  ever published unless the names and addresses of the writers are  supplied, and all stories are rejected which have anything clearly  suspicious about them. What the editors of the _Spectator_ do not do is  to reject a dog-story because it states that a dog has been observed to  do something which has never been reported as having been done by a dog  before, or at any rate, something which is not universally admitted to  be doable by a dog. Apparently this willingness to print stories which  enlarge our notions of animal intelligence is regarded in certain  quarters as a sign that the _Spectator_ will swallow anything, and that  its stories must be apocryphal. I cannot, however, help thinking that  all who care for the advancement of knowledge in regard to animals  should be grateful to the editors of the _Spectator_ for not adopting  the plan of excluding all dog stories that do not correspond with an  abstract ideal of canine intelligence. Had they acted on the principle  of putting every anecdote that seemed _prima facie_ unlikely into the  waste-paper basket, they would certainly have missed a great many  stories of real value. In truth, there is nothing so credulous as  universal incredulity. An attitude of general incredulity means a blind  belief in the existing state of opinion. If we believe that animals have  no reasoning power, and refuse to examine evidence that is brought to  show the contrary, we are adopting, the attitude of those who disbelieve  that the earth goes round the sun because they seem daily to see a proof  of an exactly opposite proposition. If people are to refuse to believe  anything of a dog that does not sound likely on the face of it, we shall  never get at the truth about animal intelligence. What is wanted is the  careful preservation and collection of instances of exceptional  intelligence.      III.    Before I conclude this Introduction, I should like to address a word of  apology to the correspondents of the _Spectator_ whose letters form the  present volume. Though the copyright of the letters belongs to the  editors and proprietors of the _Spectator_ I should have liked to ask  the leave of the various writers before republishing their letters.  Physical difficulties have, however rendered this impossible. In the  case of nearly half the letters the names and addresses have not been  preserved. In many instances, again, only the names remain. Lastly, a  large number of the letters are ten or twelve, or even twenty years old,  and the writers may therefore be dead or out of England. Under these  circumstances I have not made any effort to enter into communication  with the writers before including their letters in this book. That their  permission would have been given, had it been asked, I do not doubt. The  original communication of the letters to the _Spectator_ is proof that  the writers wished a public use to be made of the anecdotes they relate.  As long, then, as the letters are not altered or edited, but produced  verbatim, I may, I think, feel assured that I am doing nothing which is  even remotely discourteous to the writers.          _SYLLOGISTIC DOGS._          A DOG ON LONG SERMONS.              [_Aug. 4, 1888._]    During a recent journey in Canada, I met with a striking instance of  reason in a dog. I was staying at the Mohawk Indian Institution,  Brantford, Ontario. The Rev. R. Ashton, superintendent of the school, is  also incumbent of the neighbouring Mohawk Church (the oldest Protestant  church in Canada). Mr. Ashton is very fond of animals, and has many  pets. One of these, a black-and-tan terrier, always accompanies the  ninety Indian children to church on Sunday morning. He goes to the  altar-rails,"]]]
