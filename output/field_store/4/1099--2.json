TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.    In this volume I have collected all the essays on Wild Bees scattered  through the \"Souvenirs entomologiques,\" with the exception of those on  the Chalicodomae, or Mason-bees proper, which form the contents of a  separate volume entitled \"The Mason-bees.\"    The first two essays on the Halicti (Chapters 12 and 13) have already  appeared in an abbreviated form in \"The Life and Love of the Insect,\"  translated by myself and published by Messrs. A. & C. Black (in America  by the Macmillan Co.) in 1911. With the greatest courtesy and kindness,  Messrs. Black have given me their permission to include these two  chapters in the present volume; they did so without fee or consideration  of any kind, merely on my representation that it would be a great pity  if this uniform edition of Fabre's Works should be rendered incomplete  because certain essays formed part of volumes of extracts previously  published in this country. Their generosity is almost unparalleled in my  experience; and I wish to thank them publicly for it in the name of  the author, of the French publishers and of the English and American  publishers, as well as in my own.    Of the remaining chapters, one or two have appeared in the \"English  Review\" or other magazines; but most of them now see the light in  English for the first time.    I have once more, as in the case of \"The Mason-bees,\" to thank Miss  Frances Rodwell for the help which she has given me in the work  of translation and research; and I am also grateful for much kind  assistance received from the staff of the Natural History Museum and  from Mr. Geoffrey Meade-Waldo in particular.

The peasant, as he trims his hedge, whose riotous tangle threatens to  encroach upon the road, cuts the trailing stems of the bramble a foot  or two from the ground and leaves the root-stock, which soon dries up.  These bramble-stumps, sheltered and protected by the thorny brushwood,  are in great demand among a host of Hymenoptera who have families to  settle. The stump, when dry, offers to any one that knows how to use it  a hygienic dwelling, where there is no fear of damp from the sap; its  soft and abundant pith lends itself to easy work; and the top offers a  weak spot which makes it possible for the insect to reach the vein of  least resistance at once, without cutting away through the hard  ligneous wall. To many, therefore, of the Bee and Wasp tribe, whether  honey-gatherers or hunters, one of these dry stalks is a valuable  discovery when its diameter matches the size of its would-be  inhabitants; and it is also an interesting subject of study to the  entomologist who, in the winter, pruning-shears in hand, can gather in  the hedgerows a faggot rich in small industrial wonders. Visiting the  bramble-bushes has long been one of my favourite pastimes during the  enforced leisure of the wintertime; and it is seldom but some new  discovery, some unexpected fact, makes up to me for my torn fingers.    My list, which is still far from being complete, already numbers nearly  thirty species of bramble-dwellers in the neighbourhood of my house;  other observers, more assiduous than I, exploring another region and one  covering a wider range, have counted as many as fifty. I give at foot an  inventory of the species which I have noted.    (Bramble-dwelling insects in the neighbourhood of Serignan [Vaucluse]:         1. MELLIFEROUS HYMENOPTERA.

Zonitis mutica, FAB. (parasite of Osmia tridentata).    Most of these insects have been submitted to a learned expert, Professor  Jean Perez, of Bordeaux. I take this opportunity of renewing my thanks  for his kindness in identifying them for me.--Author's Note.)    They include members of very diverse corporations. Some, more  industrious and equipped with better tools, remove the pith from the dry  stem and thus obtain a vertical cylindrical gallery, the length of which  may be nearly a cubit. This sheath is next divided, by partitions, into  more or less numerous storeys, each of which forms the cell of a larva.  Others, less well-endowed with strength and implements, avail themselves  of the old galleries of other insects, galleries that have been  abandoned after serving as a home for their builder's family. Their only  work is to make some slight repairs in the ruined tenement, to clear the  channel of its lumber, such as the remains of cocoons and the litter of  shattered ceilings, and lastly to build new partitions, either with  a plaster made of clay or with a concrete formed of pith-scrapings  cemented with a drop of saliva.    You can tell these borrowed dwellings by the unequal size of the  storeys. When the worker has herself bored the channel, she economizes  her space: she knows how costly it is. The cells, in that case, are all  alike, the proper size for the tenant, neither too large nor too small.  In this box, which has cost weeks of labour, the insect has to house the  largest possible number of larvae, while allotting the necessary amount  of room to each. Method in the superposition of the floors and economy  of space are here the absolute rule.    But there is evidence of waste when the insect makes use of a bramble  hollowed by another. This is the case with Tripoxylon figulus. To obtain  the store-rooms wherein to deposit her scanty stock of Spiders, she  divides her borrowed cylinder into very unequal cells, by means of  slender clay partitions. Some are a centimetre (.39 inch.--Translator's  Note.) deep, the proper size for the insect; others are as much as two  inches. These spacious rooms, out of all proportion to the occupier,  reveal the reckless extravagance of a casual proprietress whose  title-deeds have cost her nothing.    But, whether they be the original builders or labourers touching up the  work of others, they all alike have their parasites, who constitute  the third class of bramble-dwellers. These have neither galleries to  excavate nor victuals to provide; they lay their egg in a strange cell;  and their grub feeds either on the provisions of the lawful owner's  larva or on that larva itself.    At the head of this population, as regards both the finish and the  magnitude of the structure, stands the Three-pronged Osmia (Osmia  tridentata, DUF. and PER.), to whom this chapter shall be specially  devoted. Her gallery, which has the diameter of a lead pencil, sometimes  descends to a depth of twenty inches. It is at first almost exactly  cylindrical; but, in the course of the victualling, changes occur which  modify it slightly at geometrically determined distances. The work of  boring possesses no great interest. In the month of July, we see the  insect, perched on a bramble-stump, attack the pith and dig itself a  well. When this is deep enough, the Osmia goes down, tears off a few  particles of pith and comes up again to fling her load outside. This  monotonous labour continues until the Bee deems the gallery long enough,  or until, as often happens, she finds herself stopped by an impassable  knot.    Next comes the ration of honey, the laying of the egg and the  partitioning, the last a delicate operation to which the insect proceeds  by degrees from the base to the top. At the bottom of the gallery, a  pile of honey is placed and an egg laid upon the pile; then a partition  is built to separate this cell from the next, for each larva must  have its special chamber, about a centimetre and a half (.58  inch.--Translator's Note.) long, having no communication with the  chambers adjoining. The materials employed for this partition are  bramble-sawdust, glued into a paste with the insects' saliva. Whence are  these materials obtained? Does the Osmia go outside, to gather on the  ground the rubbish which she flung out when boring the cylinder? On the  contrary, she is frugal of her time and has better things to do than to  pick up the scattered particles from the soil. The channel, as I said,  is at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

Anatomy, or a description of the structure of an  organ, is of course necessary to the understanding of its Physiology, or  its uses. Enough of the former study has, therefore, been introduced, to  enable the pupil to enter intelligently upon the latter.    Familiar language, as far as practicable, has been employed, rather than  that of a technical character. With a view, however, to supply what might  seem to some a deficiency in this regard, a Pronouncing Glossary has been  added, which will enable the inquirer to understand the meaning of many  scientific terms not in common use.    In the preparation of the work the writer has carefully examined all the  best material at his command, and freely used it; the special object being  to have it abreast of the present knowledge on the subjects treated, as far  as such is possible in a work so elementary as this. The discussion of  disputed points has been avoided, it being manifestly inappropriate in a  work of this kind.    Instruction in the rudiments of Physiology in schools does not necessitate  the general practice of dissections, or of experiments upon animals. The  most important subjects may be illustrated by {4} drawings, such as are  contained in this work. Models, especially those constructed by AUZOUX of  Paris, dried preparations of the human body, and the organs of the lower  animals, may also be used with advantage.    The writer desires to acknowledge his indebtedness to R. M. WYCKOFF, M.D.,  for valuable aid in the preparation of the manuscript for the press; and to  R. CRESSON STILES, M.D., a skilful microscopist and physician, for the  chapter \"On the Use of the Microscope in the Study of Physiology.\" Mr. AVON  C. BURNHAM, the well-known teacher of gymnastics, furnished the drawing of  the parlor gymnasium and the directions for its use.    _Brooklyn, N.
