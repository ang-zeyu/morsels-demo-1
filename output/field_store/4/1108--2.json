The Story of the Choir Boy who Became a Great Composer      Joseph Haydn was born in Rohrau, a little Austrian village not far from  Hainburg.    It is quite worth while for you to look for this town and for the River  Leytha in any large geography. You may not find Rohrau itself, for it is  a very small town, but you will surely find the River Leytha which flows  by it.    The parents lived in a very modest little house. The picture of this  house is worth studying, and remembering. As you see, it is of one story  with a thatched roof. The farm buildings are joined to the house itself.  The windows look inviting and pretty. They seem to tell us very plainly  that it is warm and cosy within.                       [Illustration: HAYDN'S BIRTHPLACE]    It will be easy for you to remember the year in which Joseph Haydn was  born, because you have already learned in school that our President,  George Washington, whose picture should be inserted here, was born in  the same year--1732.    This President's birthday was in what month? What day of the month?                           [Illustration: WASHINGTON]    Joseph Haydn was born on March 31st of the same year (he used to say  that he was born \"in the night\" between March 31st and April 1st).    Washington's father died in the year when he and Joseph Haydn were ten  years old. This is a picture of Washington, as a man, bidding his mother  good-bye before leaving for a war.                    [Illustration: WASHINGTON LEAVING HOME]    Little Joseph Haydn's father and mother were poor, but they loved  cleanliness and system.    They feared God, worked hard, and loved music. Joseph's father used to  sing in a clear tenor voice, accompanying himself on the harp. At home  little Joseph was called Sepperl.    When the child was old enough, he, too, began to sing. He quite  surprised everyone by his sweet voice.    In the neighboring town of Hainburg there lived a schoolmaster named  Frankh, who used to visit the Haydns and play the violin. Sepperl used  to watch him very closely, and one day he, too, began to play the violin  while his father and mother were singing. But he had no real violin, of  course, so he had to play on a make-believe one of two sticks. But he  sang in tune and kept time with his wooden bow.                 [Illustration: SEPPERL PLAYING ON TWO STICKS]    One day the schoolmaster chanced to come up the street while the little  boy was playing his make-believe music. Watching him closely, he saw  that he was really fond of music.    Then Cousin Frankh, as they called him, had a long talk with Sepperl's  father and mother. After a while it was agreed that the little boy  should go to Hainburg (the place you found on the map), and there become  a pupil of the schoolmaster.    They worked hard at the school in those days. Once, when Haydn was an  old man, he said: \"I shall be grateful to that man (the schoolmaster) as  long as I live, for keeping me so hard at work. But I used to get more  floggings than food.\"    When he was six years old, Sepperl could \"stand up like a man\" and sing  masses in the church choir, besides playing a little on the piano and  the violin.    It once happened that a drummer was needed in a procession in Hainburg.  Frankh called Sepperl, and showed him how to make the stroke. But the  boy was so small that someone had to carry the drum for him, Sepperl  following up and beating it as he had been taught. Haydn was very fond  of playing the drums, and even as a boy tried to learn how to play  right.                         [Illustration: HAYDN DRUMMING]    But Joseph Haydn was to do other things.    One day a man from Vienna visited the pastor of the Hainburg Church. He  heard the little boy sing and liked his voice so much that he invited  him to become a chorister in the huge Church of St. Stephen. He was  eight years old when he arrived in the great city of Vienna, still a  little farther away from home than he was at Hainburg.    There was much else to do in the great church beside singing in the  choir. There were music studies, of course, in singing, violin and piano  playing. But there were also school studies to be learned every day.  These were Religion, Latin, Writing and Arithmetic.                      [Illustration: ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH]    But one must not think that because Sepperl was a busy musician he did  not love fun like other boys of eight. One day the choristers sang at  the Royal Palace at Schoenbrunn, just outside of Vienna. The scaffolding  was still standing about the building, and Joseph climbed to the top.  The Empress Maria Theresa caught him at this mischief and gave an order  that \"that blockhead should have a good spanking.\"    Five years after Joseph Haydn entered St. Stephen's, his brother Michael  joined the choir. It was just at that time that Joseph's voice began to  change. One day when the Empress heard him she said his voice sounded  more like a rooster's crowing than anything else. The choirmaster,  taking the hint, prepared to dismiss him.    But before Joseph said good-bye to his schoolmates his spirit of fun  bubbled over again. Someone had left a pair of new scissors where he  found them.    What should he cut with them?    Ah, he knew. He would cut off the pigtail of one of the choir boys. And  he did.    Joseph Haydn was never lazy. His father and mother had taught him to  love work. He was industrious, happy-hearted, and made friends easily.  People loved him and he began to meet those who could help him. One of  these was the great poet, Metastasio. Another was the singing master,  Nicholas Porpora, who taught him music composition in return for which  the boy brushed the master's clothes, polished his boots, did anything  and everything, even to running errands. And all because he was so  anxious to be taught how to compose music.    Then soon afterward Haydn met Gluck, the opera composer; and another  time Wolfgang Mozart and his father, Leopold Mozart. So you see he was  getting on famously.                             [Illustration: GLUCK]                           [Illustration: L. MOZART]    One day he was invited to become Music Director (or Vice-Capellmeister,  as it was called) in the family of a great man who was known as Prince  Paul Anton Esterhazy.    Haydn's position in the Esterhazy home gave him just the opportunity he  wanted. There was an orchestra, and for it he composed all sorts of  music.    When the band was to play for the Prince's family and its guests, Haydn  and the players were required to wear white stockings and white collars,  and a pigtail or tie-wig.    If you could have watched him conduct the players, you would have seen a  very short man with short legs; his face pitted with the marks of  small-pox. His nose was large, his eyes gray, but of the kindest  expression.    And here is a picture which shows exactly how the \"good-natured sort of  fellow\" looked.    [Illustration: SILHOUETTE OF HAYDN]    A butcher in the town where Joseph was living wanted to celebrate his  daughter's marriage with fitting music, and was bold enough to ask  Joseph to compose a Minuet for the occasion. Joseph good-naturedly  consented, and wrote the Oxen Minuet, and made the butcher and his  daughter very happy. People say that soon after the wedding the butcher  appeared at Joseph's door leading an ox all decorated with ribbons and  with gilded horns.                          [Illustration: OXEN MINUET]    For many years Haydn remained in the peace and quiet of the Esterhazy  family life. But, nevertheless his good work was heard of in distant  places. He received many invitations to travel to foreign countries.  One of these he accepted. He went to England; twice in fact. The night  before he left Vienna he and Mozart dined together.    \"Do not go on such a long journey,\" Mozart begged of him. \"You are too  old and you do not know languages enough to travel through so many  countries.\"    \"But,\" said Haydn, \"I know one language that is understood  everywhere--the language of music.\"    Mozart said farewell to his old friend. They never met again.    On the way north, along the Rhine, Haydn met Beethoven at Bonn; and it  was arranged that Beethoven should study with Haydn on his return to  Vienna.    When the traveler reached Calais he took the boat to Dover in England.  He was so enchanted by the sight of the sea that he sat on deck all the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34554"],[0,"Selected Records of Reptiles and Amphibians from Kansas (#1)"],[1,"Records of Reptiles and Amphibians                               from Kansas                                      BY                   JOHN BREUKELMAN AND HOBART M.

SMITH      Preparation of a handbook of reptiles and amphibians by the junior  author has led to a survey of the collections of these animals at Kansas  State Teachers College in Emporia. Numerous locality records of interest  and importance have been accumulated there through the efforts of the  senior author and a number of his students, particularly Mr. Allen  Downs. The more important records, including the first record for Kansas  of _Rana sylvatica_, are reported here. We have not mentioned specimens  that are from counties from which the University of Kansas Museum of  Natural History already has specimens.    Specimens examined by Smith are indicated by an asterisk *; those  identified by the late Dr. F. N. Blanchard are indicated by an encircled  period # (none of these specimens are now available). All other  specimens here recorded have been examined either by the senior author  or by Mr. Allen Downs, or by both. Specimen numbers, unless otherwise  indicated, are those of the Kansas State Teachers College collection.    #Triturus viridescens louisianensis# (Wolterstorff), Newt.--_Cherokee  Co._: 1 mile north and 4 miles east of Crestline (No. 164).* This is a  terrestrial adult, and provides the second known locality for the  species in the state.    #Ambystoma texanum# (Matthes), Narrow-mouthed Salamander.--_Lyon Co._:  Emporia.    #Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium# (Baird), Tiger Salamander.--_Lyon Co._:  (No. 292); 2 miles east of Americus. _Ness Co._: Ness City (No. 591).    #Scaphiopus bombifrons# Cope, Plains Spadefoot.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles  west, 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 592).    #Bufo americanus americanus# (Holbrook), American Toad.--_Chase Co._: 10  miles southwest of Saffordville. _Cherokee Co._: 4 miles southeast of  Columbus. _Lyon Co._: 6 miles south of Plymouth (No. 290)*; Emporia  (Nos. 442, 443).* The records from Chase and Lyon counties represent the  westernmost localities for the species in Kansas.    #Bufo cognatus# Say, Great Plains Toad.--_Ness Co._: 4 miles west and  1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 594).    #Bufo woodhousii woodhousii# (Girard), Rocky Mountain Toad.--_Clark  Co._: 11 miles south of Bucklin (No. 401).* _Decatur Co._: Sappa Creek  near Oberlin (2 spec.).* _Ford.

Nat.  Hist., Univ. Kans., No. 23149).* This specimen provides for the first  time a basis for inclusion of the species in the fauna of Kansas. It  measures 50 mm. snout to vent; hind leg from vent 80 mm.; tibia 23 mm.  The ratio of hind leg to snout-vent measurement is 0.625, and that of  the tibia to snout-vent measurement is 2.17. Both figures are too high  for _Rana s. sylvatica_, in which the former ratio varies between 0.53  and 0.62, the latter ratio between 1.6 and 1.88. The ratios agree well  with those of _R. s. cantabrigensis_, in which the former ratio varies  from 0.62 to 0.75, the latter from 1.93 to 2.3. Direct comparison of the  specimen with typical examples of both subspecies substantiates its  allocation to _R. s. cantabrigensis_.    In the vicinity of Kansas, specimens of this species are known from  Missouri (St. Louis and Stone Counties only) and northwestern Arkansas  (Washington County: Winslow and Prairie Grove, Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ.  Kans., Nos. 16526, 18820, 18823). Reexamination of these specimens  confirms their identity as _Rana sylvatica sylvatica_ to which the  Missouri specimens from Stone County undoubtedly also belong.  Accordingly this race is still to be anticipated in extreme southeastern  Kansas.    Reference of the specimen from Lyon County to _Rana s. cantabrigensis_  presents a problem in distribution, for the race is not known from  nearer Kansas than North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and southern  Illinois, except for a record given by Cope (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No.  34:437, 1889) from \"western Missouri.\" Hurter (Trans. St. Louis Acad.  Sci., 20:123, 1911) restricts this record to Cooper County, and  presumably verifies Cope's identification. Hurter, too, recognized the  other form, _R. sylvatica_, in Missouri (Marble Cave, Stone County).  Cope distinguished between the two races (as they are now recognized)  and recorded typical _R. sylvatica_ from St. Louis. Accordingly the  specimen from Cooper County may be considered properly identified  racially. It apparently is from the locality nearest to Kansas at which  the race has been taken.    It seems highly probable that the Kansas occurrence, and possibly those  in Arkansas and Missouri also, is a relict one. It is highly improbable  that the species has a continuous distribution in either state. A wider  or more southern distribution in the past seems evident. The group to  which it belongs certainly has had a more southern range, as indicated  by Taylor's discovery in Meade County, Kansas (Univ. Kans. Sci. Bull.,  28:217, 1942), of a fossil species of _Rana_ (_parvissima_), from the  Upper Pliocene, presumably related to _sylvatica_. It may or may not  have been a direct ancestor of the living species.    #Microhyla olivacea# (Hallowell), Northern Narrow-mouthed Toad.--_Lyon  Co._: 6 miles southwest of Emporia. _Wilson Co._: 7 miles northeast of  Fall River.    #Crotaphytus collaris collaris# (Say), Collared Lizard.--_Geary Co._: 4  miles south of Fort Riley. _Wabaunsee Co._: 2 miles northeast of Alma.    #Holbrookia maculata maculata# (Girard), Earless Lizard.--_Chase Co._: 7  miles south of Saffordville (No. 350)*; 6 miles southwest of  Saffordville; 1 mile south of Saffordville (No. 338)*; 10 miles  southwest of Olpe. _Hodgeman Co._: Jetmore. _Lyon Co._: 5 miles south of  Plymouth; 6 miles southeast of Emporia; 9 miles southwest of Emporia.  _Ness Co._: 4 miles west and 1.5 miles north of Ness City (Nos. 480,  481, 484-497, 609-611)*, 6 miles west and 0.5 miles south of Ness City  (Nos. 482, 483, 498).*    #Sceloporus undulatus garmani# Boulenger, Northern Plains  Lizard.--_Ellsworth Co._: Carneiro; 10 miles south of Ellsworth.  _McPherson Co._: 4 miles west of Roxbury (No. 133). _Ness Co._: 4 miles  west and 1.5 miles north of Ness City (No. 479, 612).*    #Phrynosoma cornutum# (Harlan), Texas Horned Lizard.--_Ellsworth Co._:  10 miles south of Ellsworth. _Lyon Co._: 1 mile south of Emporia; 8  miles southwest of Emporia. _Saline Co._: Coronado Heights; 3 miles  northwest of Lindsborg.    #Ophisaurus ventralis# (Linnaeus), Glass-snake Lizard.--_Lyon Co._:  Emporia; 1 mile southwest of Emporia (No. 288).* _Rooks Co._: 5 miles  southwest of Stockton (No. 407).*    #Cnemidophorus sexlineatus# (Linnaeus), Six-lined  Racerunner.--_Ellsworth Co._: Carneiro. _Lyon Co._: 1.5 miles northwest  of Reading. _Shawnee Co._: 5 miles east of Topeka (No. 14).*    #Leiolopisma laterale# (Say), Brown Skink.--_Labette Co._: 7 miles  northwest of Mound Valley (No. 301).* _Lyon Co._: 1.5 miles northwest of  Reading. _Wilson Co._: 4 miles southwest of Coyville (No. 281).*    #Eumeces fasciatus# (Linnaeus), Common Five-lined Skink.--_Bourbon Co._:  1 mile north of Fulton. _Chase Co._: 7 miles southwest of Saffordville;  6 miles south of Clements; 2 miles south of Saffordville. _Franklin  Co._: 8 miles east of Ottawa; 2 miles south of Ottawa; 2 miles southwest  of Lane; 4 miles east of Ottawa; 5 miles southwest of Ottawa. _Labette  Co._: 2 miles southwest of Dennis; 7 miles northwest of Mound Valley.  _Lyon Co._: 1.5 miles"]]]
