Martin          INTRODUCTION      Perhaps the most important species of mammal in the grasslands of Kansas  and neighboring states is the prairie vole, _Microtus ochrogaster_  (Wagner). Because of its abundance this vole exerts a profound influence  on the quantity and composition of the vegetation by feeding, trampling  and burrowing; also it is important in food chains which sustain many  other mammals, reptiles and birds. Although the closely related meadow  vole, _M. pennsylvanicus_, of the eastern United States, has been  studied both extensively and intensively, relatively little information  concerning _M. ochrogaster_ has been accumulated heretofore.    I acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. Henry S. Fitch, resident  investigator on the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation. In  addition to supplying guidance and encouragement in both the planning  and execution of the investigation, Dr. Fitch made available for study  the data from his extensive field work. Interest in and understanding of  ecology were stimulated by his teaching and his example. Special debts  are also acknowledged to Mr. John Poole for the use of his field notes  and to Professor E. Raymond Hall, Chairman of the Department of Zoology,  for several courtesies. Dr. R. L. McGregor of the Department of Botany  at the University of Kansas assisted with the identification of some of  the plants. Drawings of skulls were made by Victor Hogg.    Of the numerous publications concerning _Microtus pennsylvanicus_, those  of Bailey (1924), Blair (1940; 1948) and Hamilton (1937a; 1937c; 1940;  1941) were especially useful in supplying background and suggesting  methods for the present study. Publications not concerned primarily with  voles, that were especially valuable to me in providing methods and  interpretations applicable to my study, were those of Blair (1941),  Hayne (1949a; 1949b), Mohr (1943; 1947), Stickel (1946; 1948) and  Summerhayes (1941). Faunal and ecological reports dealing with _M.  ochrogaster_ and containing useful information on habits and habitat  included those of Black (1937:200-202), Brumwell (1951:193-200; 213),  Dice (1922:46) and Johnson (1926). Lantz (1907) discussed the economic  relationships of _M. ochrogaster_; the section of his report concerning  the effects of voles on vegetation was especially useful to me.    Fisher (1945) studied the voles of central Missouri and obtained  information concerning food habits and nesting behavior. Jameson (1947)  studied _M. ochrogaster_ on and near the campus of the University of  Kansas. His report is especially valuable in its treatment of the  ectoparasites of voles. In my investigation I have concentrated on those  aspects of the ecology of voles not treated at all by Fisher and  Jameson, or mentioned but not adequately explored by them. Also I have  attempted to obtain larger samples.    The University of Kansas Natural History Reservation, where almost all  of the field work was done, is an area of 590 acres, comprising the  northeastern-most part of Douglas County, Kansas. Situated in the broad  ecotone between the deciduous forest and grassland, the reservation  provides a variety of habitat types (Fitch, 1952). Before 1948, much of  the area had been severely overgrazed and the original grassland  vegetation had been largely replaced by weeds. Since 1948 there has been  no grazing or cultivation. The grasses have partially recovered and, in  the summer of 1952, some grasses of the prairie climax were present even  on the parts of the Reservation which had been most heavily overgrazed.  Illustrative of the changes on the Reservation were those observed in  House Field by Henry S. Fitch (1953: _in litt._). He recalled that in  July, 1948, the field supported a closely grazed, grassy vegetation  providing insufficient cover for _Microtus_, with such coarse weeds as  _Vernonia_, _Verbena_ and _Solanum_ constituting a large part of the  plant cover. By 1950, the same area supported a lush stand of grass,  principally _Bromus inermis_, and supported many woody plants. Similar  changes occurred in the other study areas on the Reservation. Although  insufficient time has elapsed to permit analyses of successional  changes, it seems that trees and shrubs are gradually encroaching on the  grassland throughout the Reservation.    The vole population has changed radically since the Reservation was  established. In September and October of 1948, when Fitch began his  field work, he maintained lines of traps totaling more than 1000 trap  nights near the future vole study plots without capturing a single vole.  In November and December, 1948, he caught several voles near a small  pond on the Reservation and found abundant sign in the same area. Late  in 1949 he began to capture voles over the rest of the Reservation, but  not until 1950 were voles present in sufficient numbers for convenient  study.    I first visited the Reservation and searched there for sign of voles in  the summer of 1949. I found hardly any sign. In the area around the pond  mentioned above, however, several systems of runways were discovered.  This area had been protected from grazing for several years prior to the  reservation of the larger area. In House Field, where my main study plot  was to be established, there was no sign of voles. Slightly more than a  year later, in October, 1950, I began trapping and found _Microtus_ to  be abundant on House Field and present in smaller numbers throughout  grassland areas of the Reservation.          GENERAL METHODS      The present study was based chiefly on live-trapping as a means of  sampling a population of voles and tracing individual histories without  eliminating the animals. Live-trapping disturbs the biota less than  snap-trapping and gives a more reliable picture of the mammalian  community (Blair, 1948:396; Cockrum, 1947; Stickel, 1946:158; 1948:161).  The live-traps used were modeled after the trap described by Fitch  (1950). Other types of traps were tested from time to time but this  model proved superior in being easy to set, in not springing without a  catch, in protecting the captured animal and in permitting easy removal  of the animal from the trap. A wooden box was placed inside the metal  shelter attached to each trap and, in winter, cotton batting or woolen  scraps were placed inside the boxes for nesting material. With this  insulation against the cold, voles could survive the night unharmed and  could even deliver their litters successfully. In summer the nesting  material was removed but the wooden box was retained as insulation  against heat.    Bait used in live-traps was a mixture of cracked corn, milo and wheat,  purchased at a local feed store. The importance of proper baiting,  especially in winter, has been emphasized by Howard (1951) and Llewellyn  (1950) who found an adequate supply of energy-laden food, such as corn,  necessary in winter to enable small rodents to maintain body temperature  during the hours of captivity. The rare instances of death of voles in  traps in winter were associated with wet nesting material, as these  animals can survive much lower temperatures when they are dry. Their  susceptibility to wet and cold was especially evident in rainy weather  in February and March.    Preventing mortality in traps was more difficult in summer than in  winter. The traps were set in any available shade of tall grass or  weeds; or when such shade "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39421"],[0,"Mount Everest, the Reconnaissance, 1921 (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

They  have thereby enabled the present Expedition to start with full knowledge  of the results of the reconnaissance, and the public to follow the  progress of the attempt to reach the summit with full information at  hand.
