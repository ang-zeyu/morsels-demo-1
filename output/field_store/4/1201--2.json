This book  claims to be nothing more than a record of impressions. As such,  whatever may be its errors, it should at least bear witness to the  picturesque, poetic charm of the Peninsula and to the graciousness of  Spanish manners.

William  H. Gulick, the honored American missionary whose unwearied kindness  looked after us, during the break in official representation, more  effectively than a whole diplomatic corps. \"Spanish blood is a strange  _mezcla_, whose elements, Gothic, African, Oriental, are at war among  themselves. You will find Spaniards tender and cruel, boastful and  humble, frank and secretive, and all at once. It will be a journey of  surprises.\"    We were saying good-by, on February 4, 1899, to sunshiny Biarritz,  whither Mrs. Gulick's school for Spanish girls had been spirited over  the border at the outbreak of the war. Here we had found Spanish and  American flags draped together, Spanish and American friendships  holding fast, and a gallant little band of American teachers spending  youth and strength in their patient campaign for conquering the  Peninsula by a purer idea of truth. Rough Riders may be more  pictorial, but hardly more heroic.    We were barely through the custom house, in itself the simplest and  swiftest of operations, before the prophesied train of surprises  began. One of our preconceived ideas went to wreck at the very outset  on the industry of the Basque provinces. \"The lazy Spaniard\" has  passed into a proverb. The round world knows his portrait--that broad  _sombrero_, romantic cloak, and tilted cigarette. But the laborious  Spaniard can no longer be ignored. Even at Biarritz we had to reckon  with him, for the working population there is scarcely less Spanish  than French. Everybody understands both languages as spoken, and it is  a common thing to overhear animated dialogue where the talk is all  Spanish on the one side and all French on the other. The war set  streams of Spanish laborers flowing over the mountain bar into French  territory. Young men fled from conscription, and fathers of families  came under pressure of hard times. Skilled artisans, as masons and  carpenters, could make in Biarritz a daily wage of five francs, the  normal equivalent of five _pesetas_, or a dollar, while only the half  of this was to be earned on their native side of the Pyrenees. Such,  too, was the magic of exchange that these five francs, sent home,  might transform themselves into ten, eight, or seven and a half  _pesetas_. Even when we entered Spain, after the Paris Commission had  risen, the rate of exchange was anything but stable, varying not  merely from day to day, but from hour to hour, a difference of two or  three per cent often occurring between morning and evening. The  conditions that bore so heavily on the crafts were crushing the field  laborers almost to starvation. In point of excessive toil, those  peasants of northern Spain seemed to us worse off than Mr. Markham's  \"Man with the Hoe,\" for the rude mattock, centuries out of date, with  which they break up the ground, involves the utmost bodily exertion.  And by all that sweat of the brow, they were gaining, on an average,  ten or twelve cents a day.    No wonder that discontent clouded the land. We met this first at  Pasajes, on one of the excursions arranged for our pleasure by the  overflow goodness of that missionary garrison. The busiest of teachers  had brought us--a young compatriot from a Paris studio and myself--so  far as San Sebastian, where she lingered long enough to make us  acquainted with a circle of friends, and, incidentally, with Pasajes.  This Basque fishing hamlet is perched between hill and sea, with a  single rough-paved street running the length of the village from the  Church of St. Peter to the Church of St. John. Nature has not been  chary of beauty here. The mountain-folded Bay of Pasajes appears at  first view like an Alpine lake, but the presence of stately Dutch and  Spanish merchantmen in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by The Internet Archive)                [ Transcriber's Note:        Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as      possible, including inconsistencies in spelling, punctuation and      hyphenation.

IN THE DAY OF BATTLE      321             AFTERWORD                 347          LAD: A DOG          CHAPTER I    HIS MATE      Lady was as much a part of Lad's everyday happiness as the sunshine  itself. She seemed to him quite as perfect, and as gloriously  indispensable. He could no more have imagined a Ladyless life than a  sunless life. It had never occurred to him to suspect that Lady could  be any less devoted than he--until Knave came to The Place.    Lad was an eighty-pound collie, thoroughbred in spirit as well as in  blood. He had the benign dignity that was a heritage from endless  generations of high-strain ancestors. He had, too, the gay courage of  a d'Artagnan, and an uncanny wisdom. Also--who could doubt it, after  a look into his mournful brown eyes--he had a Soul.    His shaggy coat, set off by the snowy ruff and chest, was like  orange-flecked mahogany. His absurdly tiny forepaws--in which he took  inordinate pride--were silver white.    Three years earlier, when Lad was in his first prime (before the  mighty chest and shoulders had filled out and the tawny coat had waxed  so shaggy), Lady had been brought to The Place. She had been brought  in the Master's overcoat pocket, rolled up into a fuzzy gold-gray ball  of softness no bigger than a half-grown kitten.    The Master had fished the month-old puppy out of the cavern of his  pocket and set her down, asprawl and shivering and squealing, on the  veranda floor. Lad had walked cautiously across the veranda, sniffed  inquiry at the blinking pigmy who gallantly essayed to growl defiance  up at the huge welcomer--and from that first moment he had taken her  under his protection.    First it had been the natural impulse of the thoroughbred--brute or  human--to guard the helpless. Then, as the shapeless yellow baby grew  into a slenderly graceful collie, his guardianship changed to stark  adoration. He was Lady's life slave.    And she bullied him unmercifully--bossed the gentle giant in a  shameful manner, crowding him from the warmest spot by the fire,  brazenly yet daintily snatching from between his jaws the choicest  bone of their joint dinner, hectoring her dignified victim into  lawn-romps in hot weather when he would far rather have drowsed under  the lakeside trees.    Her vagaries, her teasing, her occasional little flurries of temper,  were borne by Lad not meekly, but joyously. All she did was, in his  eyes, perfect. And Lady graciously allowed herself to be idolized,  for she was marvelously human in some ways. Lad, a thoroughbred  descended from a hundred generations of thoroughbreds, was less human  and more disinterested.    Life at The Place was wondrous pleasant for both the dogs. There were  thick woods to roam in, side by side; there were squirrels to chase  and rabbits to trail. (Yes, and if the squirrels had played fair and  had not resorted to unsportsmanly tactics by climbing trees when close  pressed, there would doubtless have been squirrels to catch as well as  to chase. As for the rabbits, they were easier to overtake. And Lady  got the lion's share of all such morsels.)    There was the ice-cool lake to plunge into for a swim or a wallow,  after a run in the dust and July heat. There was a deliciously  comfortable old rug in front of the living-room's open fire whereon to  lie, shoulder to shoulder, on the nights when the wind screamed  through bare trees and the snow scratched hungrily at the panes.    Best of all, to them both, there were the Master and the Mistress;  especially the Mistress.    Any man with money to make the purchase may become a dog's _owner_.  But no man--spend he ever so much coin and food and tact in the  effort--may become a dog's _Master_ without the consent of the  dog. Do you get the difference? And he whom a dog once unreservedly  accepts as Master is forever that dog's God.    To both Lad and Lady, from the first, the man who bought them was  not the mere owner but the absolute Master. To them he was the  unquestioned lord of life and death, the hearer and answerer, the  Eternal Law; his the voice that must be obeyed, whatever the command.    From earliest puppyhood, both Lad and Lady had been brought up within  the Law. As far back as they could remember, they had known and obeyed  The Place's simple code.    For example: All animals of the woods might lawfully be chased; but  the Mistress' prize chickens and the other little folk of The Place  must be ignored no matter how hungry or how playful a collie might  chance to be. A human, walking openly or riding down the drive into  The Place by daylight, must not be barked at except by way of friendly  announcement. But anyone entering the grounds from other ingress than  the drive, or anyone walking furtively or with a tramp slouch, must be  attacked at sight.    Also, the interior of the house was sacrosanct. It was a place for  perfect behavior. No rug must be scratched, nothing gnawed or played  with. In fact, Lady's one whipping had followed a puppy-frolic effort  of hers to \"worry\" the huge stuffed bald eagle that stood on a  papier-mache stump in the Master's study, just off the big living-room  where the fireplace was.    That eagle, shot by himself as it raided the flock of prize chickens,  was the delight of the Master's heart. And at Lady's attempt on it, he  had taught her a lesson that made her cringe for weeks thereafter at  bare sight of the dog-whip. To this day, she would never walk past the  eagle without making the widest possible detour around it.    But that punishment had been suffered while she was still in the  idiotic days of puppyhood. After she was grown, Lady would no more  have thought of tampering with the eagle or with anything else in the  house than it would occur to a human to stand on his head in church.    Then, early one spring, came Knave--a showy, magnificent collie;  red-gold of coat save for a black \"saddle,\" and with alert topaz eyes.    Knave did not belong to the Master, but to a man who, going to Europe  for a month, asked him to care for the dog in his absence. The Master,  glad to have so beautiful an ornament to The Place, had willingly  consented. He was rewarded when, on the train from town, an admiring  crowd of commuters flocked to the baggage-car to stare at the  splendid-looking collie.    The only dissenting note in the praise-chorus was the grouchy old  baggage-man's.    \"Maybe he's a thoroughbred, like you say,\" drawled the old fellow to  the Master, \"but I never yet saw a yellow-eyed, prick-eared dog I'd  give hell-room to.\"    Knave showed his scorn for such silly criticism by a cavernous yawn.    \"Thoroughbred?\" grunted the baggage-man. \"With them streaks of  pinkish-yeller on the roof of his mouth? Ever see a thoroughbred that  didn't have a black mouth-roof?\"    But the old man's slighting words were ignored with disdain by the  crowd of volunteer dog-experts in the baggage-car. In time the Master  alighted at his station, with Knave straining joyously at the  leash. As the Master reached The Place and turned into the drive, both  Lad and Lady, at sound of his far-off footsteps, came tearing around  the side of the house to greet him.    On simultaneous sight and scent of the strange dog frisking along at  his side, the two collies paused in their madly joyous onrush. Up went  their ruffs. Down went their heads.    Lady flashed forward to do battle with the stranger who was monopolizing  so much of the Master's attention. Knave, not at all averse to battle  (especially with a smaller dog), braced himself and then moved"]]]
