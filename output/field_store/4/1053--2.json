[Illustration: Helen]          INTRODUCTION.    Dear Children:    I do not feel wholly sure that my Pussy wrote these letters herself.  They always came inside the letters written to me by my mamma, or other  friends, and I never caught Pussy writing at any time when I was at  home; but the printing was pretty bad, and they were signed by Pussy's  name; and my mamma always looked very mysterious when I asked about  them, as if there were some very great secret about it all; so that  until I grew to be a big girl, I never doubted but that Pussy printed  them all alone by herself, after dark.    They were written when I was a very little girl, and was away from home  with my father on a journey. We made this journey in our own carriage,  and it was one of the pleasantest things that ever happened to me. My  clothes and my father's were packed in a little leather valise which was  hung by straps underneath the carriage, and went swinging, swinging,  back and forth, as the wheels went round. My father and I used to walk  up all the steep hills, because old Charley, our horse, was not very  strong; and I kept my eyes on that valise all the while I was walking  behind the carriage; it seemed to me the most unsafe way to carry a  valise, and I wished very much that my best dress had been put in a  bundle that I could carry in my lap. This was the only drawback on the  pleasure of my journey,--my fear that the valise would fall off when we  did not know it, and be left in the road, and then I should not have  anything nice to wear when I reached my aunt's house. But the valise  went through all safe, and I had the satisfaction of wearing my best  dress every afternoon while I stayed; and I was foolish enough to think  a great deal of this.    On the fourth day after our arrival came a letter from my mamma, giving  me a great many directions how to behave, and enclosing this first  letter from Pussy. I carried both letters in my apron pocket all the  time. They were the first letters I ever had received, and I was very  proud of them. I showed them to everybody, and everybody laughed hard at  Pussy's, and asked me if I believed that Pussy printed it herself. I  thought perhaps my mamma held her paw, with the pen in it, as she had  sometimes held my hand for me, and guided my pen to write a few words. I  asked papa to please to ask mamma, in his letter, if that were the way  Pussy did it; but when his next letter from mamma came, he read me this  sentence out of it: \"Tell Helen I did not hold Pussy's paw to write that  letter.\" So then I felt sure Pussy did it herself; and as I told you, I  had grown up to be quite a big girl before I began to doubt it. You see  I thought my Pussy such a wonderful Pussy that nothing was too  remarkable for her to do. I knew very well that cats generally did not  know how to read or write; but I thought there had never been such a  cat in the world as this Pussy of mine. It is a great many years since  she died; but I can see her before me to-day as plainly as if it were  only yesterday that I had really seen her alive.    She was a little kitten when I first had her; but she grew fast, and was  very soon bigger than I wanted her to be. I wanted her to stay little.  Her fur was a beautiful dark gray color, and there were black stripes on  her sides, like the stripes on a tiger. Her eyes were very big, and her  ears unusually long and pointed. This made her look like a fox; and she  was so bright and mischievous that some people thought she must be part  fox. She used to do one thing that I never heard of any other cat's  doing: she used to play hide-and-seek. Did you ever hear of a cat's  playing hide-and-seek? And the most wonderful part of it was, that she  took it up of her own accord. As soon as she heard me shut the gate in  the yard at noon, when school was done, she would run up the stairs as  hard as she could go, and take her place at the top, where she could  just peep through the banisters. When I opened the door, she would give  a funny little mew, something like the mew cats make when they call  their kittens. Then as soon as I stepped on the first stair to come up  to her, she would race away at the top of her speed, and hide under a  bed; and when I reached the room, there would be no Pussy to be seen. If  I called her, she would come out from under the bed; but if I left the  room, and went down stairs without speaking, in less than a minute she  would fly back to her post at the head of the stairs, and call again  with the peculiar mew. As soon as I appeared, off she would run, and  hide under the bed as before. Sometimes she would do this three or four  times; and it was a favorite amusement of my mother's to exhibit this  trick of hers to strangers. It was odd, though; she never would do it  twice, when she observed that other people were watching. When I called  her, and she came out from under the bed, if there were strangers  looking on, she would walk straight to me in the demurest manner, as if  it were a pure accident that she happened to be under that bed; and no  matter what I did or said, her frolic was over for that day.    She used to follow me, just like a little dog, wherever I went. She  followed me to school every day, and we had great difficulty on Sundays  to keep her from following us to church. Once she followed me, when it  made a good many people laugh, in spite of themselves, on an occasion  when it was very improper for them to laugh, and they were all feeling  very sad. It was at the funeral of one of the professors in the college.    The professors' families all sat together; and when the time came for  them to walk out of the house and get into the carriages to go to the  graveyard, they were called, one after the other, by name. When it came  to our turn, my father and mother went first, arm-in-arm; then my sister  and I; and then, who should rise, very gravely, but my Pussy, who had  slipped into the room after me, and had not been noticed in the crowd.  With a slow and deliberate gait she walked along, directly behind my  sister and me, as if she were the remaining member of the family, as  indeed she was. People began to smile, and as we passed through the  front door, and went down the steps, some of the men and boys standing  there laughed out. I do not wonder; for it must have been a very comical  sight. In a second more, somebody sprang forward and snatched Pussy up.  Such a scream as she gave! and scratched his face with her claws, so  that he was glad to put her down. As soon as I heard her voice I turned  round, and called her in a low tone. She ran quickly to me, and I picked  her up and carried her in my arms the rest of the way. But I saw even my  own papa and mamma laughing a little, for just a minute. That was the  only funeral Pussy ever attended.    Pussy lived several years after the events which are related in these  letters.    It was a long time before her fur grew out again after that terrible  fall into the soft-soap barrel. However, it did grow out at last, and  looked as well as ever. Nobody would have known that any thing had been  the matter with her, except that her eyes were always weak. The edges of  them never got quite well; and poor Pussy used to sit and wash them by  the hour; sometimes mewing and looking up in my face, with each stroke  of her paw on her eyes, as much as to say, \"Don't you see how sore my  eyes are? Why don't you do something for me?\"    She was never good for any thing as a mouser after that accident, nor  for very much to play with. I recollect hearing my mother say one day to  somebody,--\"Pussy was spoiled by her experience in the cradle. She would  like to be rocked the rest of her days, I do believe; and it is too  funny to see her turn up her nose at tough beef. It was a pity she ever  got a taste of tenderloin!\"    At last, what with good feeding and very little exercise, she grew so  fat that she was clumsy, and so lazy that she did not want to do any  thing but lie curled up on a soft cushion.    She had outgrown my little chair, which had a green moreen cushion in  it, on which she had slept for many a year, and of which I myself had  very little use,--she was in it so much of the time. But now that this  was too tight for her, she took possession of the most comfortable  places she could find, all over the house. Now it was a sofa, now it was  an arm-chair, now it was the foot of somebody's bed. But wherever it  happened to be, it was sure to be the precise place where she was in the  way, and the poor thing was tipped headlong out of chairs, shoved  hastily off sofas, and driven off beds so continually, that at last she  came to understand that when she saw any person approaching the chair,  sofa, or bed on which she happened to be lying, the part of wisdom for  her was to move away. And it was very droll to see the injured and  reproachful expression with which she would slowly get up, stretch all  her legs, and walk away, looking for her next sleeping-place. Everybody  in the house, except me, hated the sight of her; and I had many a  pitched battle with the servants in her behalf. Even my mother, who was  the kindest human being I ever knew, got out of patience at last, and  said to me one day:--    \"Helen, your Pussy has grown so old and so fat, she is no comfort to  herself, and a great torment to everybody else. I think it would be a  mercy to kill her.\"    \"Kill my Pussy!\" I exclaimed, and burst out crying, so loud and so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32189"],[0,"The Raising and Care of Guinea Pigs (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

The Guinea Pig or Cavy belongs to the rabbit family and is a native of  South America. Why they are called Guinea Pigs, no one seems to know,  unless their shape suggests a small pig and the name Guinea is a  corruption of Guiana, a country in South America. In size, shape and  texture of fur they resemble a squirrel or rabbit. They have large  bodies, short legs, small feet, no tails and a wide range of colors. A  full grown Cavy weighs between two and three pounds, which weight it  attains at about 18 months of age. The males are usually larger than the  females.    When white people first visited the Andean region of South America they  found the Cavy domesticated and living in the houses of the Indians, by  whom they were used for food. They were introduced into Europe in the  16th Century and since that time have spread all over the world. In  South America there are still several species of wild Cavies. These are  hunted as game and are considered a great delicacy.    Cavies are wholly vegetarian in diet, eating about the same things as a  rabbit. They are very easily tamed, are very healthy and hardy, are not  noisy, are clean in their habits, and have no offensive odor. There is  probably no animal in the world that is easier to handle. They easily  adapt themselves to conditions and seem to do equally as well in city or  country, in large or small quarters and a few of them together do as  well as a large number of them.    They are practically free from the diseases and epidemics that make the  raising of poultry and rabbits so uncertain. Some of them get sick and  die, of course, but it is usually due to some local cause or to the fact  that they have been neglected or improperly fed or housed, but  contagious diseases such as will often wipe out whole flocks of poultry  or a pen of rabbits are unknown among Cavies.    All of these things make the raising of Guinea Pigs a very pleasant as  well as a very profitable occupation.          CHAPTER II    VARIETIES.      English.    There are several varieties of Cavies, distinguished mainly by their  fur. The ones most commonly raised and most widely known are the English  or smooth-haired. These are the ones you should raise for commercial  purposes. They may be in color: white, black, red, fawn, cream, gray,  brindle, brown, or a mixture of these colors. The whites are usually  albinos and have pink eyes.    [Illustration: Abyssinian Cavy]      Peruvian.    The Peruvian has long silken hair and may be called the aristocrat of  Cavydom. They are raised principally by fanciers and for general  purposes are no more valuable than the short haired ones, are not as  hardy and are more trouble to handle as their coat needs careful  attention.      Abyssinian.    This, like the Peruvian, is also a fancy breed. It has longer hair than  the short-haired, and it stands out in curious little rosettes. These  are more hardy than the Peruvian and are more common.      The Kind to Raise.    If you expect to raise Cavies for commercial purposes the English is the  kind that should pay you best. They are easier to take care of than the  long-haired varieties. For laboratories, experimental purposes, etc., it  is the smooth-haired Cavy that is in most demand. If you are a Guinea  Pig fancier or are raising them for pet purposes it is merely a matter  of taste and choice. The long-haired ones are usually more expensive and  sell for more, as they are scarcer and are generally sold for pet and  fancy purposes. It is usually well to have a few Abyssinian among your  stock if you are raising many, as many people prefer them for pets.          CHAPTER III    USES OF GUINEA PIGS.      There are three main uses to which Guinea Pigs are put, as food, as pets  and for experimental purposes in laboratory and medical research. By far  the largest demand is in the last named field.      Scientific Uses.    There is possibly no animal so well adapted for scientific experiments  as the Guinea Pig. In the testing and analyzing of serums and antitoxins  and for experimental purposes generally the demand is enormous,  thousands and thousands of them being used every year. Many of the large  hospitals and laboratories have been compelled to establish breeding  pens of their own in order to be sure of a constant supply. The demand  here is steadily increasing and many more would be used if they could be  obtained at a reasonable price. A United States Bulletin says, \"Guinea  Pigs sell at various prices dependant on supply and demand. The average  price for several years has been about 75c, but laboratories now report  that suitable stock is short and that they have been paying from $1.00  to $1.50 for their supply of animals.\" For these purposes they are used  all the way from nine weeks to six months or more old or when they weigh  from 9 ounces and up. The cost of rearing them to this age is very  little and a good profit is therefore assured the raiser.      As Pets.    The demand for Guinea Pigs as pets is very large. They are so widely  used in the medical field that the pet stores have a hard time keeping  enough on hand to supply the local demand for pets. They are very  interesting and perfectly harmless little animals. They do not bite or  scratch and young children can play with them. They are not as common as  the ordinary pet, and being more of a novelty, attract more attention.  When sold as pets they usually bring more than when sold to the  hospitals and raisers are assured of a very large demand for this  purpose. In England and Europe the Guinea Pig is more widely raised than  in America and there are more fanciers who show and exhibit them  extensively. They are becoming more popular in this country and are  being exhibited more and more in Pet Stock Shows. A good show animal is  worth all the way from $10 to $100. As a hobby the raising of Guinea  Pigs is most interesting and instructive as there are so many  experiments that can be made in the breeding.      As Food.    For food purposes Guinea Pigs are admirable, although not many are eaten  in this country at the present time. However, many of the newspapers and  magazines have run articles suggesting that they be raised for this  purpose and there is really no reason why they should not be. The United  States Government indorses them as food animals and advises that they  be used in this connection. In a few years we will possibly see Guinea  Pigs sold in the stores as rabbits and poultry are now. Certainly no  animal could be cleaner and being a vegetarian exclusively, its flesh is  of the best. They can be prepared just as a rabbit or squirrel. In  soups, stews, pies, or roasted, broiled or baked the young Cavy is equal  to any other animal. For this purpose the animal should be about  one-half grown.    [Illustration: English Cavies]          CHAPTER IV    FOOD AND FEEDING.      The feeding of Guinea Pigs is a very simple matter. Their main food is  good hay or dried grass. This should be before them all the time, as  they will not eat too much of it. Be sure, however, that it is not musty  or mouldy.    In addition to hay, they should have at least once a day, a feeding of  green food. This is essential in keeping them from becoming constipated.  By green food we mean such things as lawn clippings, green clover,  spinach, green corn stalks, lettuce, celery tops, plantain, dandelion,  grasses, etc., which is, of course, very plentiful in the summer. In the  winter when you cannot get these, carrots, beets, apples, cabbage,  mangle beets, yellow turnips, etc., will take their place.    The grains such as oats, wheat, corn, bran, chops, etc., should be fed  them, as it makes flesh and gives them strength. Oats is probably the  best of them all. Stale bread is also good, but it should not be greasy  or mouldy. A good plan is to feed in the morning hay and grain or a bran  or chops mash instead of the grain. At noon some green stuff or roots  and at night hay. Give them all the hay they can eat. Keep it before  them all of the time, but only feed as much green stuff as they can  clear up in a few hours. They are also not apt to overeat grain, which  should be fed in an earthen or wooden vessel. If you feed only twice a  day, give them the green food in the morning with the hay. Guinea Pigs  drink but little water when eating green food, but they should have a  vessel of fresh water in"]]]
