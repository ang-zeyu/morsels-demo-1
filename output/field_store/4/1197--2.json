The ship canal from Ghent to Terneuzen was originally laid out with  many bends, rendering navigation difficult; it had a depth of 14 feet  4 inches and a width of 98 feet 6 inches at the water level. The works  which are at present in course of execution have especially for their  object the deepening of the canal to 21 feet 3 inches, with a width  of 55 feet 9 inches at the bottom and 103 feet 9 inches on the water  line. The slopes have a uniform inclination of 1 to 3, and the towing  paths on each side are placed 6 feet 6 inches above the water level,  and are 32 feet 8 inches wide. In many instances also the course of  the canal has been altered and straightened for the improvement of  navigation; several important diversions have been made for this  purpose. The excavation has been effected by hand, by dredging, and by  the Couvreux excavator, figured as below in _Engineering_.    The earth excavated was carried to spoil, and in many cases was  employed to form dikes inclosing large areas, which served as  receptacles for the semi-liquid material excavated by the dredging  machines with the long conductors; the Couvreux excavator used will be  readily understood from the engraving. It had already done service on  the Danube regulation works. The material with which it had to deal,  however, was of a more difficult nature, being a fine sand charged  with water and very adherent. The length of track laid for the  excavator was about 3 miles along the side of the old canal, which had  been previously lowered to the level of the water.           *       *       *       *       *          PRESERVATION OF IRON AND STEEL FROM OXIDATION.      We are indebted to J. Pechar, Railway Director in Teplitz, Bohemia,  for the first official report in English from the Paris International  Exhibition which has come to hand. This volume contains the report  on the coal and iron products in all countries of the world, and is  valuable for its statistical and other information, giving, as it  does, the places where the coal and minerals are found, and the  quantities of each kind produced, for what it is used, and to what  other countries it is exported. The able compiler of these statistics  in the introduction of his report gives the following account of  the means recommended by Professor Barff, of London, for preventing  oxidation, which is being considerably used abroad. The writer says:    It is well known that the efficient preservation of iron against  rusting is at present only provided for in cases where human life  would be endangered by failure, as in the case of railway bridges  and steamers. Thus, for example, at Mr. Cramer-Klett's ironworks at  Nuremberg every piece of iron used for his bowstring bridges is dipped  in oil heated to eight hundred degrees. The very great care which  is at present taken in this matter may be judged from the current  practice of most bridge and roofing manufacturers. Every piece of  iron before being riveted in its place is cleaned from rust by being  immersed in a solution of hydrochloric acid. The last traces of free  acid having been cleared away, at first by quicklime and afterward by  a copious ablution with hot water, the piece is immediately immersed  in hot linseed oil, which protects every part of the surface from the  action of the atmosphere. Afterward it is riveted and painted.    Notwithstanding all this, the painting requires continual and  careful renewal. On the Britannia Bridge, near Bangor, the painter is  permanently at work; yet, in spite of all this care and expense, rust  cannot be entirely avoided. The age of iron railway bridges is still  too short to enable us to draw conclusions as to the probabilities of  accidents. Now, Professor Barff has discovered a process by which  iron may be kept from rusting by being entirely coated with its own  sesquioxide. A piece of iron exposed to the action of superheated  steam, in a close chamber and under a certain pressure, becomes  gradually covered by a skin of this black oxide, of a thickness  depending upon the temperature of the steam and the duration of  the experiment. For instance, exposure during five hours to steam  superheated to five hundred degrees will produce a hermetical coating  capable of resisting for a considerable time the application of emery  paper and of preserving the iron from rust even in a humid atmosphere,  if under shelter from the weather. If the temperature is raised to  1,200 degrees, and the time of exposure to six or seven hours, the  skin of sesquioxide will resist every mechanical action, and the  influence of any kind of weather. The sesquioxide being harder than  the iron itself, and adhering to its surface even more firmly than the  atoms of iron do to each other, there is an increased resistance not  only to chemical but also to mechanical action. The surface is not  altered by the process in any other respect, a plain forging retaining  its roughness, a polished piece its smooth surface. If the skin is  broken away oxidation takes place, but only just on the spot from  which the oxide has been removed. If Professor Barff's experiments  are borne out by practice, this invention may become of very great  importance. It is within the bounds of probability that it may enable  iron, by increasing its facility in competing with wood, to recover,  at least for a considerable time, even more than the ground it has  lost by the extraordinary extension of the use of steel. Iron is  already being used for building purposes to a large extent; but  oxidation once thoroughly prevented it will be able to take the place  of wood and stone to a still greater degree. Iron roofing may be  made quite as light as that of wood, and of greater strength, by a  judicious arrangement and use of T iron.           *       *       *       *       *          WARNING TO LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS.      Drs. Charles M. Cresson and Robert E. Rogers, of this city, says  the Philadelphia _Ledger_, well known as experts in chemistry and  dynamics, were appointed by the Reading Railroad Company to inquire  into and report upon the causes of the recent explosion of the boiler  of the express locomotive \"Gem,\" at Mahanoy City, by which five lives  were lost. Their report, which is designed to cover the whole scope  of a most careful investigation, is not yet made public, but they have  arrived at the following specific conclusion, which we give in their  own language: \"We are, therefore, of the opinion that the explosion of  the boiler of the locomotive 'Gem,' was produced by the projection of  foam upon the heated crown bars of the furnace, caused by suddenly  and widely opening the safety valve, at a time when the water had been  permitted to get so low as to overheat the crown of the furnace.\" This  is an important matter that should be carefully noted by locomotive  and other engineers.           *       *       *       *       *          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN      ESTABLISHED"]]]
