The Domestic Cat, by Gordon Stables.    ________________________________________________________________________    ________________________________________________________________________  THE DOMESTIC CAT, BY GORDON STABLES.    CHAPTER ONE.    CLASSIFICATION: ITS BASIS.    In the feline world you find no such diversity, of form, shape,  disposition, coat, size, etc, as you do in the canine.  Dogs differ from  each other in both the size and conformation of the skeleton, and in  many other important points, almost as much as if they belonged to  entirely different species.  Mark, for instance, how unlike the bulldog  is to the greyhound, or the Scotch toy-terrier to the English mastiff;  yet, from the toy-terrier upwards to the giant Saint Bernard, they are  all _dogs_, every one of them.  So is the jackal, so is the fox and the  wolf.  The domesticated dog himself, indeed, is the best judge as to  whether any given animal belongs to his own species or not.  I have  taken dogs to different zoological gardens, and have always found that  they were ready enough to hob-nob with either jackal or fox, if the  latter were only decently civil; but they will turn away with  indifference, or even abhorrence, from a wild goat or sloth.  But among  the various breeds of cats there exists no such characteristic  differences, so that in proposing a classification one almost hesitates  to use the word \"breed\" at all, and feels inclined to search about for  another and better term.  If I were not under a vow not to let my  imagination run riot in these papers, but to glide gently over the  surface of things, rather than be erudite, philosophical, theoretical,  or speculative, I should feel sorely tempted to pause here for a moment,  and ask myself the question--Why are there so many distinct breeds of  the domesticated dog, and, properly speaking, only one of the more  humble cat?  Did the former all spring from the same original stock, or  are certain breeds, such as the staghound, etc, more directly descended  from the wolf, the collie, Pomeranian, etc, from the fox after his kind,  and other breeds from animals now entirely extinct in the wild state?  And once upon a time, as the fairy books say, did flocks of wolves,  foxes, wild mastiffs, and all dogs run at large in these islands,  clubbing together in warlike and predatory bands, each after his kind,  much in the same way that the Scottish Highlanders used to do two or  three hundred years ago?  Animals of the dog kind are a step or two more  advanced in civilisation, if I may be allowed to use the term, than  cats; and hence, as intelligence can appreciate intelligence, and always  seeks to rise to a higher level, more breeds, or a larger number of  species, of the former than of the latter have forsaken their wild or  natural condition to attach themselves to man.  May not the time come,  in the distant future, when a larger variety of feline animals shall  become fashionable--when domesticated tigers, tame lions, or pet ocelots  shall be the rage?  If so, that will indeed be the millennium for cats.  Just fancy how becoming it would be to meet the lovely and accomplished  Miss De Dear out walking, and leading a beautiful leopard by a slight  silver chain, or Lady Bluesock in her phaeton, with a tame ocelot beside  John on the dickey!  A lady beside a lion on the lawn would, I think,  make a prettier picture than one by the side of a peacock, and a tame  Bengalese tiger would be a pet worthy to crouch at the foot of a throne.  To be sure, little bits of mistakes would occur at times; instead of  the pussy of the period bolting away with the canary, nothing less would  satisfy the pet than a nice fat baby, and then those extraordinary  people the cat--exterminators would be louder in their denunciations  than ever.    If we dissect the cat, we will find that the skeleton of one breed of  pussy would pretty nearly pass for that of another; we find the same  shape and almost the same size of bones, the same arrangement of teeth  as regards their levelness, the same number of teeth, and the same  formation of jawbone.  Clothe that skeleton with muscle, and still you  can hardly tell the breed of the cat, for scarcely will you be able to  find a muscle in the one breed that has not its fellow in all, a little  difference perhaps in the size and development of one or two, but even  this more the result of accident and use than a distinction real and  natural.    I feel as I write that I am sailing as close to a wind as possible; I am  luffing all my ship will steer; were I to keep her away a single point,  I should drift down into the pleasant gulf-stream of comparative  anatomy, and thence away and away to the broad enchanted ocean of  speculative theory.  And I confess, too, I wouldn't mind a cruise or two  in those latitudes, did space and time admit of it.    Now, I do not mean to say that there is really no difference in shape  and form between the different breeds of the domestic cat, but rather  that this difference is so minute, compared to that which exists between  dogs, that the term \"breeds\" seems almost a misnomer as applied to cats.  It is only when you see pussy arrayed in all the wealth and beauty of  her lovely fur, that you can see any real distinction between her and  another.    In regard to the origin of the domestic cat, naturalists have squabbled  and fought for centuries, and the best thing possible, I think, is for  every man steadfastly to retain his own opinion, then everybody is sure  to be right.  For myself, I really cannot see that it would either  assist us in breeding better cats, or render us a bit more humane in our  treatment of the pretty animal, to be assured that she was first  imported into this country from Egypt or Persia in the year one thousand  and ever so much before Christ, or that the father of all the cats was a  Scottish wild cat, captured and tamed by some old Highland witch-wife a  thousand years before the birth of Noah's grandfather.  What matters it  to us whether the pussy that purrs on our footstool is a polecat bred  bigger, or a Polar bear bred less?  There she is,--      The rank is but the guinea stamp,    And a cat's a cat for a' that.    But, and if, you are fond of pedigree, why then surely it ought to  satisfy you to know that, ages before your ancestors or mine could  distinguish between a B and a bull, pussy was the pet of Persian  princes, the idol of many a harem, and the playmate of many a juvenile  Pharaoh.  What classification, then, are we to make of cats?  We search  around us in vain for something to guide us; then, fairly on our  beam-ends, are fain to clutch at the only solution to the question, and  fall back upon coat and colour, with some few distinctive points of  difference in the size and shape of the skull and body.  Colour or  markings, then, and quality of coat, are the guiding distinctions  between one breed of cat and another; and to these we add, as  auxiliaries, size and shape.    _Colour_.--Whether we understand it or not, there, undoubtedly, is  nothing in this world left to chance alone, and nothing, I sincerely  believe, is done by Nature without a purpose.  The same merciful  Providence that clothes the lambs with wool, the reason for which we can  understand, paints the rose's petal, the pigeon's breast, or even the  robin's egg, for reasons which to us are inscrutable, or only to be  vaguely guessed at.  We can tell the \"why\" and the \"wherefore\" of the  rainbow's evanescent hues, but who shall investigate the laws that  determine the fixed colours of the animal and vegetable creation?  Who  shall tell us why the grass is green, the rose is red, that bullfinch on  the pear-tree so glorious in his gaudiness, and that sparrow so humble  in his coat of brown?    If we ask the Christian philosopher, he will tell us that the colours in  animated nature are traced by the finger of God, who always paints the  coat or skin of an animal with that tint or hue, which shall tend most  to the propagation and preservation of its species.  That He clothes the  hare and rabbit in a suit of humble brown, that they may be less easily  seen by the eye of the sportsman, or their natural enemies, the polecat,  weasel, white owl, or golden-headed eagle.  That birds--who flit about  all summer in coats so gay and jackets so gaudy, that even a hawk may  mistake them for bouquets of flowers, and think them not worth eating--  as soon as the breeding season is over, and the leaves and flowers fade  and fall, are presented by nature with warmer but more homely suits of  apparel, more akin in colour to the leafless hedgerows, or the brown of  the rustling beech leaves, among which they seek shelter from the wintry  blast.  If you go farther you may fare worse.  No one in the world can  be a greater admirer than I of the genius of Tyndall, Darwin, or Huxley,  but I must confess they get a little, just a _leetle_, \"mixed\" at times;  and I doubt if Darwin himself, or any other sublunarian whatever,  understands his (Darwin's) theory of colour.  He says, for instance--I  can't use the exact words, but can give his meaning in my own--that the  wild rabbit or the hare was not painted by the finger of nature the  colour we find them with any pre-defined idea of protecting the animal  against its enemies; but that in the struggle for life that has been  going on for aeons, considering the conditions of its surroundings, it  was only the grey rabbit that had the power of continuing in existence,  escaping its enemies by aid of its dusky coat.  Darwin thinks, indeed,  that religionists put the cart before the horse, to use a homely phrase.  I confess that I myself prefer the good old theory of design--of a God  of design, and a prescient Providence.  I believe the testimony of the  rocks, I"]]]
