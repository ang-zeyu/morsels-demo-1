FIRST PROPOSITION.     Property is Impossible, because it demands Something for Nothing.       SECOND PROPOSITION.     Property is Impossible, because, wherever it exists, Production     costs more than it is worth.       THIRD PROPOSITION.     Property is Impossible, because, with a given Capital, Production     is proportional to Labor, not to Property.       FOURTH PROPOSITION.     Property is Impossible, because it is Homicide.       FIFTH PROPOSITION.     Property is Impossible, because, if it exists, Society devours itself.       Appendix to the Fifth Proposition.       SIXTH PROPOSITION.     Property is Impossible, because it is the Mother of Tyranny.       SEVENTH PROPOSITION.     Property is Impossible, because, in consuming its Receipts, it     loses them; in hoarding them, it nullifies them; and, in     using them as Capital, it turns them against Production.       EIGHTH PROPOSITION.     Property is Impossible, because its Power of Accumulation is     infinite, and is exercised only over Finite Quantities.

SECOND MEMOIR     LETTER TO M. BLANQUI ON PROPERTY            P. J. PROUDHON: HIS LIFE AND HIS WORKS.    The correspondence [1] of P. J. Proudhon, the first volumes of which we  publish to-day, has been collected since his death by the faithful  and intelligent labors of his daughter, aided by a few friends. It was  incomplete when submitted to Sainte Beuve, but the portion with which  the illustrious academician became acquainted was sufficient to allow  him to estimate it as a whole with that soundness of judgment which  characterized him as a literary critic.    He would, however, caution readers against accepting the biographer's  interpretation of the author's views as in any sense authoritative;  advising them, rather, to await the publication of the remainder  of Proudhon's writings, that they may form an opinion for  themselves.--Translator.      In an important work, which his habitual readers certainly have not  forgotten, although death did not allow him to finish it, Sainte Beuve  thus judges the correspondence of the great publicist:--    \"The letters of Proudhon, even outside the circle of his particular  friends, will always be of value; we can always learn something from  them, and here is the proper place to determine the general character of  his correspondence.    \"It has always been large, especially since he became so celebrated;  and, to tell the truth, I am persuaded that, in the future, the  correspondence of Proudhon will be his principal, vital work, and that  most of his books will be only accessory to and corroborative of this.  At any rate, his books can be well understood only by the aid of his  letters and the continual explanations which he makes to those who  consult him in their doubt, and request him to define more clearly his  position.    \"There are, among celebrated people, many methods of correspondence.  There are those to whom letter-writing is a bore, and who, assailed with  questions and compliments, reply in the greatest haste, solely that the  job may be over with, and who return politeness for politeness, mingling  it with more or less wit. This kind of correspondence, though coming  from celebrated people, is insignificant and unworthy of collection and  classification.    \"After those who write letters in performance of a disagreeable duty,  and almost side by side with them in point of insignificance, I should  put those who write in a manner wholly external, wholly superficial,  devoted only to flattery, lavishing praise like gold, without counting  it; and those also who weigh every word, who reply formally and  pompously, with a view to fine phrases and effects. They exchange words  only, and choose them solely for their brilliancy and show. You think  it is you, individually, to whom they speak; but they are addressing  themselves in your person to the four corners of Europe. Such letters  are empty, and teach as nothing but theatrical execution and the  favorite pose of their writers.    \"I will not class among the latter the more prudent and sagacious  authors who, when writing to individuals, keep one eye on posterity.  We know that many who pursue this method have written long, finished,  charming, flattering, and tolerably natural letters. Beranger furnishes  us with the best example of this class.    \"Proudhon, however, is a man of entirely different nature and habits.  In writing, he thinks of nothing but his idea and the person whom he  addresses: ad rem et ad hominem. A man of conviction and doctrine, to  write does not weary him; to be questioned does not annoy him. When  approached, he cares only to know that your motive is not one of futile  curiosity, but the love of truth; he assumes you to be serious, he  replies, he examines your objections, sometimes verbally, sometimes  in writing; for, as he remarks, 'if there be some points which  correspondence can never settle, but which can be made clear by  conversation in two minutes, at other times just the opposite is the  case: an objection clearly stated in writing, a doubt well expressed,  which elicits a direct and positive reply, helps things along more than  ten hours of oral intercourse!' In writing to you he does not hesitate  to treat the subject anew; he unfolds to you the foundation and  superstructure of his thought: rarely does he confess himself  defeated--it is not his way; he holds to his position, but admits the  breaks, the variations, in short, the EVOLUTION of his mind. The history  of his mind is in his letters; there it must be sought.    \"Proudhon, whoever addresses him, is always ready; he quits the page  of the book on which he is at work to answer you with the same pen, and  that without losing patience, without getting confused, without  sparing or complaining of his ink; he is a public man, devoted to the  propagation of his idea by all methods, and the best method, with him,  is always the present one, the latest one. His very handwriting, bold,  uniform, legible, even in the most tiresome passages, betrays no haste,  no hurry to finish. Each line is accurate: nothing is left to chance;  the punctuation, very correct and a little emphatic and decided,  indicates with precision and delicate distinction all the links in the  chain of his argument. He is devoted entirely to you, to his business  and yours, while writing to you, and never to anything else. All the  letters of his which I have seen are serious: not one is commonplace.    \"But at the same time he is not at all artistic or affected; he does  not CONSTRUCT his letters, he does not revise them, he spends no time in  reading them over; we have a first draught, excellent and clear, a jet  from the fountain-head, but that is all. The new arguments, which he  discovers in support of his ideas and which opposition suggests to  him, are an agreeable surprise, and shed a light which we should vainly  search for even in his works. His correspondence differs essentially  from his books, in that it gives you no uneasiness; it places you in  the very heart of the man, explains him to you, and leaves you with an  impression of moral esteem and almost of intellectual security. We feel  his sincerity. I know of no one to whom he can be more fitly compared in  this respect than George Sand, whose correspondence is large, and at the  same time full of sincerity. His role and his nature correspond. If  he is writing to a young man who unbosoms himself to him in sceptical  anxiety, to a young woman who asks him to decide delicate questions of  conduct for her, his letter takes the form of a short moral essay, of a  father-confessor's advice. Has he perchance attended the theatre (a  rare thing for him) to witness one of Ponsart's comedies, or a drama of  Charles Edmond's, he feels bound to give an account of his impressions  to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36020"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#1)"],[1,"http://www.pgdp.net.

Poole_    _HE LOVED YOUNG MARSTER JOHN_    Some friends driving to Oak Grove, Ala., gave the writer the opportunity  on August 4th to interview an old ex-slave, Charlie Aarons, who is quite  venerable in appearance, and who, when asked his age, replied:    \"Madam I don't know but I sure been 'round here long time\", and when  asked how old he was at the time of the Surrender he answered:    \"I was a man able to do a man's work so I 'spects I was eighteen or  twenty years old.\"    Uncle Charlie, as he is known among his own color and the white people  who know him, told the writer he was born at Petersburg Va., and his  parents, Aaron and Louisa, were owned by a Mr. J.H. White, who had a  store in the city, but no plantation. His parents had three children,  two boys and one girl, and when Uncle Charlie was about ten years of  age, he was sold by Mr. White to a speculator named Jones who brought  him to Mobile. He recalled being placed on the block, at the slave mart  on Royal and State streets, and the anxiety of hearing the different  people bidding for him, and being finally sold to a Mr. Jason Harris,  who lived near Newton Station in Jasper County, Miss.    Uncle Charlie never saw or heard of his parents or brother and sister  again and never knew what became of them.    Uncle Charlie said Mr. Harris was a pretty rough master, and somewhat  close. All rations were weighed out and limited. He had a white overseer  and a negro driver, who was the meanest of all.    Mr. Jason Harris had about sixty slaves, and a large plantation of a  hundred acres, the men and women worked in the fields from six to six,  except on Saturday, when they had half day holiday to clean up  generally.    The home of the Harris family was a large two story house and the  quarters were the regular log cabins with clay chimneys. They cooked in  their cabins, but during the busy season in the fields their dinners  were sent out to them each slave having his own tin pail marked with his  name. Water would be sent out in a barrel mounted on an ox cart.    The old men and women looked after the children of the slaves while  their parents worked in the fields.    When the writer asked Uncle Charlie, if his master or mistress ever  taught him to read or write, he smiled and said:    \"No, Madam, only to work\".    When asked if they had any special festivities at Christmas or any other  holiday, he replied:    \"No, we had no special jolifications\".    Saturday nights they would sing and dance in the quarters and have  prayer meetings, then on some Sundays, they would hitch up the mules to  a big wagon and all go to the white folks church: and again there would  be camp meetings held and the slaves from all the surrounding  plantations would attend, going to same in these large wagons, sometimes  having four mules to a wagon. They then would have a jolly time along  the way, singing and calling to one another, and making friends.    Uncle Charlie, said, he drove many a load of cotton in the large mule  wagons from Newton Station to Enterprise, Mississippi.    When asked if that wasn't a chance to run away, he replied:    \"Git away, why Madam, those nigger dogs would track you and all you got  was a beating.\"    Uncle Charlie seemed to look off in the distance and said: \"You know,  Madam, I never saw a slave rebuked until I came to Mississippi,\" and I  just couldn't understand at first, but he grinned and said: \"Lordy,  Madam, some of those niggers were onery, too, and a nigger driver was a  driver sure enough.\"    When the Master's son John Harris went to war, Charlie went with him as  his body guard, and when asked what his duties were, he replied:    \"I looked after Marster John, tended the horses and the tents. I recalls  well, Madam, the siege of Vicksburg.\"    The writer then asked him if he wasn't afraid of the shot and shell all  around him.    \"No, Madam,\" he replied, \"I kept way in the back where the camp was, for  I didn't like to feel the earth trembling 'neath my feet, but you see,  Madam, I loved young Marster John, and he loved me, and I just had to  watch over that boy, and he came through all right.\"    Uncle Charlie said when they were told the Yankees were coming through  from their headquarters in Meridian, Mississippi, and warned of their  raids, they all made to the swamps and staid until they had passed on,  but that the Yankees did not disturb the Jason Harris plantation.    After the Surrender Charlie came to Mobile and worked at the Yankee  Camp, living in the quarters located in Holly's Garden. He drove their  wagons and was paid $14.00 a month and"]]]
