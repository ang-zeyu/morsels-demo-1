A couple of hundreds of  millions of years either way do not matter, since at least that much  time was required for the inter-passage. At about that same time--within  the same plus-or-minus ten percent margin of error, it is  believed--practically all of the suns of both those galaxies became  possessed of planets.    There is much evidence to support the belief that it was not merely a  coincidence that so many planets came into being at about the same time  as the galactic inter-passage. Another school of thought holds that it  was pure coincidence; that all suns have planets as naturally and as  inevitably as cats have kittens.    Be that as it may, Arisian records are clear upon the point that before  the two galaxies began to coalesce, there were never more than three  solar systems present in either; and usually only one. Thus, when the  sun of the planet upon which their race originated grew old and cool,  the Arisians were hard put to it to preserve their culture, since they  had to work against time in solving the engineering problems associated  with moving a planet from an older to a younger sun.    Since nothing material was destroyed when the Eddorians were forced into  the next plane of existence, their historical records also have become  available. Those records--folios and tapes and playable discs of  platinum alloy, resistant indefinitely even to Eddore's noxious  atmosphere--agree with those of the Arisians upon this point.  Immediately before the Coalescence began there was one, and only one,  planetary solar system in the Second Galaxy; and, until the advent of  Eddore, the Second Galaxy was entirely devoid of intelligent life.    Thus for millions upon untold millions of years the two races, each the  sole intelligent life of a galaxy, perhaps of an entire space-time  continuum, remained completely in ignorance of each other. Both were  already ancient at the time of the Coalescence. The only other respect  in which the two were similar, however, was in the possession of minds  of power.    Since Arisia was Earth-like in composition, atmosphere, and climate, the  Arisians were at that time distinctly humanoid. The Eddorians were not.  Eddore was and is large and dense; its liquid a poisonous, sludgy syrup;  its atmosphere a foul and corrosive fog. Eddore was and is unique; so  different from any other world of either galaxy that its very existence  was inexplicable until its own records revealed the fact that it did not  originate in normal space-time at all, but came to our universe from  some alien and horribly different other.    As differed the planets, so differed the peoples. The Arisians went  through the usual stages of savagery and barbarism on the way to  Civilization. The Age of Stone. The Ages of Bronze, of Iron, of Steel,  and of Electricity. Indeed, it is probable that it is because the  Arisians went through these various stages that all subsequent  Civilizations have done so, since the spores which burgeoned into life  upon the cooling surfaces of all the planets of the commingling galaxies  were Arisian, not Eddorian, in origin. Eddorian spores, while  undoubtedly present, must have been so alien that they could not develop  in any one of the environments, widely variant although they are,  existing naturally or coming naturally into being in normal space and  time.    The Arisians--especially after atomic energy freed them from physical  labor--devoted themselves more and ever more intensively to the  exploration of the limitless possibilities of the mind.    Even before the Coalescence, then, the Arisians had need neither of  space-ships nor of telescopes. By power of mind alone they watched the  lenticular aggregation of stars which was much later to be known to  Tellurian astronomers as Lundmark's Nebula approach their own galaxy.  They observed attentively and minutely and with high elation the  occurrence of mathematical impossibility; for the chance of two galaxies  ever meeting in direct, central, equatorial-plane impact and of passing  completely through each other is an infinitesimal of such a high order  as to be, even mathematically, practically indistinguishable from zero.    They observed the birth of numberless planets, recording minutely in  their perfect memories every detail of everything that happened; in the  hope that, as ages passed, either they or their descendants would be  able to develop a symbology and a methodology capable of explaining the  then inexplicable phenomenon. Carefree, busy, absorbedly intent, the  Arisian mentalities roamed throughout space--until one of them struck an  Eddorian mind.           *       *       *       *       *    While any Eddorian could, if it chose, assume the form of a man, they  were in no sense man-like. Nor, since the term implies a softness and a  lack of organization, can they be described as being amoeboid. They were  both versatile and variant. Each Eddorian changed, not only its shape,  but also its texture, in accordance with the requirements of the moment.  Each produced--extruded--members whenever and wherever it needed them;  members uniquely appropriate to the task then in work. If hardness was  indicated, the members were hard; if softness, they were soft. Small or  large, rigid or flexible; joined or tentacular--all one. Filaments or  cables; fingers or feet; needles or mauls--equally simple. One thought  and the body fitted the job.    They were asexual: sexless to a degree unapproached by any form of  Tellurian life higher than the yeasts. They were not merely  hermaphroditic, nor androgynous, nor parthenogenetic. They were  completely without sex. They were also, to all intents and purposes and  except for death by violence, immortal. For each Eddorian, as its mind  approached the stagnation of saturation after a lifetime of millions of  years, simply divided into two new-old beings. New in capacity and in  zest; old in ability and in power, since each of the two \"children\"  possessed in toto the knowledges and the memories of their one \"parent.\"    And if it is difficult to describe in words the physical aspects of the  Eddorians, it is virtually impossible to write or to draw, in any  symbology of Civilization,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32817"],[0,"A New Tortoise, Genus Gopherus, From North-central Mexico (#1)"],[1,"OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS  MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY      Volume 11, No. 5, pp. 335-343, pls. 7 and 8  April 24, 1959        A New Tortoise, Genus Gopherus,  From North-central Mexico      BY    JOHN M.

Dickerman, 19 May 1954.        _Diagnosis._--A large tortoise of the genus _Gopherus_, having a      flat-topped, posteriorly-flared shell, carapacal laminae that are      pale with contrasting dark centers (at least on the lateral margins      of the carapace), intergular seam longer than interhumeral, obtuse      gular projections, and a relatively wider skull than other Mexican      representatives of the genus.        _Description of species._--Ground color of carapace pale yellow to      straw in smaller specimens, pale brown in larger specimens; in some      specimens a slight indication of darker radial markings on      carapace; epidermal areolae of carapace (if present) and first two      or three zones of growth (around areolae) dark brown to black,      their contrast with the ground color greater in smaller specimens;      ground color of lateral marginals yellowish, much paler than      remainder of carapace; black areolae of marginals contrasting      sharply with ground color even in old individuals; plastron pale,      approximately the same shade of yellow as lateral marginals, marked      with sharply contrasting blotches of black or dark brown in younger      specimens, becoming immaculate with age.        Carapace low, evenly arched or slightly flat-topped in cross      section, its height slightly more than 50 per cent of its length;      top of carapace, between highest parts of first and fourth central      laminae, more or less flat in profile; carapace flared, wider      posteriorly than anteriorly; central laminae all broader than long,      the first not (or but slightly) narrower posteriorly than      anteriorly; plastron deeply notched behind, the inner margins of      the notch straight, neither convex nor concave; gular projections      truncate (not pronglike) having no notch or but a shallow notch      between them; greatest combined width of gular laminae much greater      than greatest length; interlaminal length of gular greater than      that of humeral; one large axillary scute on each side,      approximately rectangular but slightly wider below than above; one      or two inguinal scutes on each side, the anterior roughly      triangular and much larger than posterior.        Anterior surface of antebrachium having enlarged, juxtaposed (or      slightly imbricated), osteodermal scales arranged in seven to eight      longitudinal rows, each scale yellowish with a black or dark brown      center; scales on lateral edge of antebrachium, from fifth claw to      elbow, ten in number and darker than other antebrachial scales; two      enlarged black-tipped, yellow spurs on posterior surface of thigh,      inner spur approximately half the size of outer. Head relatively      wide, greatest width of skull slightly more than 80 per cent of      condylobasilar length; width of head 1.3 to 1.7 times diameter of      hind foot; scales on top of head large but irregularly arranged      (see table 1 for measurements of type and paratypes).

He stated that the      iris of his smaller specimen was yellow and the iris of a larger      specimen brown.        It will be most interesting to learn the color of juveniles of _G.      flavomarginatus_. Considering the dark color of the epidermal      areolae of adults, I would expect the color of hatchlings to be      dark brown to nearly black, with each lamina acquiring paler      borders as it grew, rather than acquiring darker borders as is      usually the case in _G. berlandieri_ (personal observation),      _agassizii_ (Miller, 1932:194, pl. 2; Woodbury and Hardy, 1948:165,      figs. 9 and 10), and _polyphemus_ (personal observation).

Three of the specimens (USNM 60976, IU 42954, and KU 39415)      have a supernumerary central lamina. All of the specimens from      Durango are anomalous in regard to the marginal laminae. In the      holotype the first marginals are small, approximately as wide as      the small precentral. In the largest paratype (USNM 61254) the      first and second marginals are fused to form a single large scute      on each side. In the remaining Durangan paratype (USNM 60976) there      are eleven normal marginals on each side but a supernumerary lamina      occurs between the first and second marginal on the left and      between the precentral and first marginal on the right side. The      remaining three paratypes have the number of marginals that is      normal for the genus.        _Relationships._--_Gopherus flavomarginatus_ differs from all other      species of the genus by its larger size and by having an intergular      seam that is longer than the interhumeral seam. The possession of      a single, rectangular axillary scale, wider below than above,      also tends to distinguish _flavomarginatus_ from other living      _Gopherus_; in the other species this scute (frequently paired in      _berlandieri_) is generally triangular or at least pointed below.      Femoral spurs are developed to varying degrees in the other species      of _Gopherus_; they are usually lacking in individuals of small to      medium size. In large specimens of _agassizii_ and _polyphemus_      that I have examined, there is but one enlarged spur, although      several pointed osteodermal scales may be present on the back of      the thigh.        _Gopherus berlandieri_, the closest relative of _G. flavomarginatus_      in a geographic sense, has a highly arched shell and pronglike gular      projections, between which there is nearly always a deep notch.      _Gopherus agassizii_, morphologically the closest Mexican relative      of _flavomarginatus_, differs from it in having a narrower head and      in lacking the contrasting pale and dark coloration of the plastron      and lateral marginal area. _Gopherus polyphemus_ seems to be the      closest relative of _flavomarginatus_ and differs from it in having      an unflared shell (anterior and"]]]
