His eyes sparked like an emery-wheel biting cold steel. His  thin, sharp-ridged nose rose high and the nostrils quivered. His pale,  almost bloodless lips were set in rigid lines over his finely chiseled,  birdlike beak with its aggressive Vandyke beard. His hair bristled  straight and stiff, like the neck-feathers of a ruffled cock, over the  edge of his linen collar. It was this latter evidence of the governor's  unpleasant humor that his military associate, General Gysbert Karel  Vanden Bosch, observed with growing anxiety.    The governor took a pinch of snuff with great deliberation and glared  across the big table of his cabinet-room at the general. Vanden Bosch  shrank visibly.    \"Then, my dear _generaal_,\" he demanded, \"you say we must let these sons  of Jazebel burn down my residences, behead my residents, and feed my  _controlleurs_ to the crocodiles without interference from the  military?\"    \"_Ach_, no, your excellency!\" General Vanden Bosch expostulated hastily.  \"Not that!\"    \"I fear I have not understood you, my dear general. What do you advise?\"    The icy sweetness of the choleric Van Schouten sent a cold shiver along  the commander's spine. He wriggled nervously in the capacious armchair  that he filled so snugly. Quite unconsciously he mumbled to himself the  clause which the pious Javanese had added to their prayers since Van  Schouten's coming to Batavia: \"And from the madness of the _orang  blanda_ devil at the _paleis_, Allah deliver us.\"    \"Ha! _generaal_, what do you say?\" the governor exclaimed.    Vanden Bosch coughed noisily and rallied his wits.    \"Ahem, your excellency; ah-hum! It is a problem, as your excellency  knows. I could send Colonel Heyns and his regiment to Bulungan, if your  excellency so desires. But--ahem--as your excellency knows, all he will  find is empty huts. Not a proa on the sea; not a Dyak in his field.\"    \"You might as well send that many wooden men!\" Van Schouten snapped.    The general winced. His portentously solemn features that for forty  years had impressed the authorities at The Hague with his sagacity in  military affairs became severely grave. Oracularly he suggested:    \"Would it not be wise, your excellency, to give Mynheer Muller, the  _controlleur_, more time? His last report was very satisfactory. Very  satisfactory, indeed!\" He smacked his lips at the satisfactoriness  thereof.    \"_Donder en bliksem!_\" the governor swore, crashing his lean fist on the  table. \"More time for what? The taxes have not been paid for two years.  Not a kilo of rice has been grown on our plantations. Not a liter of  dammargum has been shipped here. The cane is left to rot uncut. Fire has  ravaged the cinchona-groves my predecessors set with such care. Every  ship brings fresh reports of piracies, of tribal wars, and head-hunting.  How much longer must we possess our souls in patience while these things  go on?\"    The general shook his head with a brave show of regret.    \"_Ach!_ your excellency,\" he replied sadly; \"he promised so well.\"    \"Promises,\" the governor retorted, \"do not pay taxes.\"    Vanden Bosch rubbed his purple nose in perplexity.    \"I suppose it is the witch-woman again,\" he remarked, discouragedly.    \"Who else?\" Van Schouten growled. \"Always the witch-woman. That spawn of  Satan, Koyala, is at the bottom of every uprising we have in Borneo.\"    \"That is what we get for letting half-breeds mingle with whites in our  mission schools,\" Vanden Bosch observed bitterly.    The governor scowled. \"That folly will cost the state five hundred  _gulden_,\" he remarked. \"That is the price I have put on her head.\"    The general pricked up his ears. \"H-m, that should interest Mynheer  Muller,\" he remarked. \"There is nothing he likes so well as the feel of  a guilder between his fingers.\"    The governor snorted. \"_Neen, generaal_,\" he negatived. \"For once he has  found a sweeter love than silver. The fool fairly grovels at Koyala's  feet, Sachsen tells me.\"    \"So?\" Vanden Bosch exclaimed with quickened interest. \"They say she is  very fair.\"    \"If I could get my hands on her once, the Argus Pheasant's pretty  feathers would molt quickly,\" Van Schouten snarled. His fingers closed  like an eagle's talons.    \"Argus Pheasant, Bintang Burung, the Star Bird--'tis a sweet-sounding  name the Malays have for her,\" the general remarked musingly. There was  a sparkle in his eye--the old warrior had not lost his fondness for a  pretty face. \"If I was younger,\" he sighed, \"I might go to Bulungan  myself.\"    The governor grunted.    \"You are an old cock that has lost his tail-feathers, _generaal_,\" he  growled. \"This is a task for a young man.\"    The general's chest swelled and his chin perked up jauntily.    \"I am not so old as you think, your excellency,\" he retorted with a  trace of asperity.    \"_Neen, neen, generaal_,\" the governor negatived, \"I cannot let you  go--not for your own good name's sake. The gossips of Amsterdam and The  Hague would have a rare scandal to prate about if it became whispered  around that Gysbert Vanden Bosch was scouring the jungles of Bulungan  for a witch-woman with a face and form like Helen of Troy's.\"    The general flushed. His peccadillos had followed him to Java, and he  did not like to be reminded of them.    \"The argus pheasant is too shy a bird to come within gunshot, your  excellency,\" he replied somberly. \"It must be trapped.\"    \"Ay, and so must she,\" the governor assented. \"That is how she got her  name. But you are too seasoned for bait, my dear _generaal_.\" He  chuckled.    Vanden Bosch was too much impressed with his own importance to enjoy  being chaffed. Ignoring the thrust, he observed dryly:    \"Your excellency might try King Saul's plan.\"    \"Ha!\" the governor exclaimed with interest. \"What is that?\"    Van Schouten prided himself on his knowledge of the Scriptures, and the  general could not repress a little smirk of triumph at catching him  napping.    \"King Saul tied David's hands by giving him his daughter to wife,\" he  explained. \"In the same way, your excellency might clip the Argus  Pheasant's wings by marrying her to one of our loyal servants. It might  be managed most satisfactorily. A proper marriage would cause her to  forget the brown blood that she hates so bitterly.\"    \"It is not her brown blood that she hates, it is her white blood,\" Van  Schouten contradicted. \"But who would be the man?\"    \"Why not Mynheer Muller, the _controlleur_!\" Vanden Bosch asked. \"From  what your excellency says, he would not be unwilling. Then our troubles  in Bulungan would be over.\"    Van Schouten scowled thoughtfully.    \"It would be a good match,\" the general urged. \"He is only common  blood--a Marken herring-fisher's son by a Celebes woman. And she\"--he  shrugged his shoulders--\"for all her pretty face and plump body she is  Leveque, the French trader's daughter, by a Dyak woman.\"    He licked his lips in relish of the plan.    Van Schouten shook his head.    \"No, I cannot do it,\" he said. \"I could send her to the  coffee-plantations--that would be just punishment for her  transgressions. But God keep me from sentencing any woman to marry.\"    \"But, your excellency,\" Vanden Bosch entreated.    \"It is ridiculous, _generaal_,\" the governor cut in autocratically. \"The  argus pheasant does not mate with the vulture.\"    Vanden Bosch's face fell. \"Then your excellency must appoint another  resident,\" he said, in evident disappointment.

District Superintendent of Schools    The City of New York    and    A. B. Poland, Ph.D.    Superintendent of Schools    Newark N. J.          PREFACE      The study of history, like the study of a landscape, should begin  with the most conspicuous features. Not until these have been fixed  in memory will the lesser features fall into their appropriate  places and assume their right proportions.    The famous men of ancient and modern times are the mountain peaks  of history. It is logical then that the study of history should  begin with the biographies of these men.    Not only is it logical; it is also pedagogical. Experience has  proven that in order to attract and hold the child's attention  each conspicuous feature of history presented to him should have  an individual for its center. The child identifies himself with  the personage presented. It is not Romulus or Hercules or Caesar or  Alexander that the child has in mind when he reads, but himself,  acting under similar conditions.    Prominent educators, appreciating these truths, have long recognized  the value of biography as a preparation for the study of history  and have given it an important place in their scheme of studies.    The former practice in many elementary schools of beginning the  detailed study of American history without any previous knowledge  of general history limited the pupil's range of vision, restricted  his sympathies, and left him without material for comparisons.  Moreover, it denied to him a knowledge of his inheritance from  the Greek philosopher, the Roman lawgiver, the Teutonic lover of  freedom. Hence the recommendation so strongly urged in the report  of the Committee of Ten--and emphasized, also, in the report of  the Committee of Fifteen--that the study of Greek, Roman and modern  European history in the form of biography should precede the study  of detailed American history in our elementary schools. The Committee  of Ten recommends an eight years' course in history, beginning  with the fifth year in school and continuing to the end of the  high school course. The first two years of this course are given  wholly to the study of biography and mythology. The Committee of  fifteen recommends that history be taught in all the grades of  the elementary school and emphasizes the value of biography and  of general history.    The series of historical stories to which this volume belongs was  prepared in conformity with the foregoing recommendations and with  the best practice of leading schools. It has been the aim of the  authors to make an interesting story of each man's life and to  tell these stories in a style so simple that pupils in the lower  grades will read them with pleasure, and so dignified that they  may be used with profit as text-books for reading.    Teachers who find it impracticable to give to the study of mythology  and biography a place of its own in an already overcrowded curriculum  usually prefer to correlate history with reading and for this purpose  the volumes of this series will be found most desirable.    The value of the illustrations can scarcely be over-estimated.  They will be found to surpass in number and excellence anything  heretofore offered in a school-book. For the most part they are  reproductions of world-famous pictures, and for that reason the  artists' names are generally affixed.

Now we come to  a time when the power of Rome was broken and tribes of barbarians  who lived north of the Danube and the Rhine took possession of  lands that had been part of the Roman Empire. These tribes were the  Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks and Anglo-Saxons. From them have come  the greatest nations of modern times. All except the Huns belonged  to the same race and are known as Teutons. They were war-like,  savage and cruel. They spoke the same language--though in different  dialects--and worshiped the same gods. Like the old Greeks and  Romans they had many gods.    Woden, who was also called Odin, was the greatest of all. His name  means \"mighty warrior,\" and he was king of all the gods. He rode  through the air mounted on Sleip'nir, an eight-footed horse fleeter  than the eagle. When the tempest roared the Teutons said it was  the snorting of Sleipnir. When their ships came safely into port  they said it was Woden's breath that had filled their sails and  wafted their vessels over the blue waters.    [Illustration: THOR THROWING HIS HAMMER]    Thor, a son of Woden, ranked next to him among the gods. He rode  through the air in a chariot drawn by goats. The Germans called  him Donar and Thunar, words which are like our word thunder. From  this we can see that he was the thunder god. In his hand he carried  a wonderful hammer which always came back to his hand when he threw  it. Its head was so bright that as it flew through the air it made  the lightning. When it struck the vast ice mountains they reeled  and splintered into fragments, and thus Thor's hammer made thunder.    Another great god of our ancestors was Tiew. He was a son of Woden  and was the god of battle. He was armed with a sword which flashed  like lightning when he brandished it. A savage chief named Attila  routed the armies of the Romans and so terrified all the world  that he was called \"The Scourge of God.\" His people believed that  he gained his victories because he had the sword of Tiew, which  a herdsman chanced to find where the god had allowed it to fall.  The Teutons prayed to Tiew when they went into battle.    Frija (_free' ya_) was the wife of Woden and the queen of the gods.  She ruled the bright clouds that gleam in the summer sky, and caused  them to pour their showers on meadow and forest and mountain.    Four of the days of the week are named after these gods. Tuesday  means the day of Tiew; Wednesday, the day of Woden; Thursday, the  day of Thor; and Friday, the day of Frija.    Frija's son was Bald'ur; who was the favorite of all the gods.  Only Lo'ki, the spirit of evil, hated him. Baldur's face was as  bright as sunshine. His hair gleamed like burnished gold. Wherever  he went night was turned into day.    One morning when he looked toward earth from his father Woden's  palace black clouds covered the sky, but he saw a splendid rainbow  reaching down from the clouds to the earth. Baldur walked upon  this rainbow from the home of the gods to the dwellings of men.  The rainbow was a bridge upon which the gods used to come to earth.    When Baldur stepped from the rainbow-bridge to the earth he saw  a king's daughter so beautiful that he fell in love with her.    But an earthly prince had also fallen in love with her. So he and  Baldur fought for her hand. Baldur was a god and hence was very  much stronger than the prince. But some of Baldur's magic food  was given to the prince and it made him as strong as Baldur.    Frija heard about this and feared that Baldur was doomed to be  killed. So she went to every beast on the land and every fish of  the sea and every bird of the air and to every tree of the wood  and every plant of the field and made each promise not to hurt  Baldur.    But she forgot the mistletoe. So Loki, who always tried to do mischief,  made an arrow of mistletoe, and gave it to the prince who shot and  killed Baldur with it.    Then all the gods wept, the summer breeze wailed, the leaves fell  from the sorrowing trees, the flowers faded and died from grief, and  the earth grew stiff and cold. Bruin, the bear, and his neighbors,  the hedgehogs and squirrels, crept into holes and refused to eat  for weeks and weeks.    The pleasure of all living things in Baldur's presence means the  happiness that the sunlight brings. The sorrow of all living things  at his death means the gloom of northern countries when winter  comes.    The Val-kyr'ies were beautiful female warriors. They had some of  Woden's own strength and were armed with helmet and shield and  spear. Like Woden, they rode unseen through the air and their horses  were almost as swift as Sleipnir himself. They swiftly carried  Woden's favorite warriors to Valhalla, the hall of the slain. The  walls of Valhalla were hung with"]]]
