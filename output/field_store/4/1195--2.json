B. TYRRELL, M.A.        TORONTO      THE CHAMPLAIN SOCIETY      1911              _All rights reserved._              PREFACE        BY SIR EDMUND WALKER      _President of the Champlain Society_      When the Champlain Society was first organised in 1905 one of the works  on its list of proposed publications was the _Journal_ of Samuel Hearne.  This book, written with great literary charm, is the first account  preserved to us of an attempt to explore the interior of far-northern  Canada from a base on Hudson Bay. The natives had brought to Fort Prince  of Wales glowing reports of a vast store of copper at the mouth of a  river which flowed into the Arctic Ocean. An attempt to find it was  inevitable. Twice Hearne failed, but his third effort succeeded and,  after a laborious journey, he reached the mouth of the Coppermine River.  Soon after he was promoted to command at Fort Prince of Wales, now  Churchill, on Hudson Bay. France had joined Britain's revolted colonies  in their war on the mother land, and one day, in 1782, a French  squadron, under the well-known seaman, La Perouse, dropped anchor before  Fort Prince of Wales. Hearne, mightier with the pen than with the sword,  surrendered meekly enough in spite of his massive walls from thirty to  forty feet thick. Thus ingloriously he dies out of history.    Hearne's _Journal_, published after his early death, has become a rather  rare book. Besides the narrative of what he did, it contains copious  notes on the natural history of the region which he was the first white  man to make known. A new edition has long been needed. Yet to secure  competent editing was a difficult task, since few knew the remote  country which Hearne explored. It may be regarded as fortunate that the  new edition has been delayed, for only now are we able to present  Hearne's story with the annotations necessary to give it the last  possible elucidation. The needed knowledge is supplied by Mr. J. B.  Tyrrell and Mr. E. A. Preble, two writers pre-eminently suited for their  task by journeys in the regions described by Hearne, on parts of which  so few white men have set eyes.    Mr. J. B. Tyrrell began his work of exploring in North Western Canada in  1883, and during the ensuing fifteen years he made many important  additions to our knowledge of the geology and geography of what is still  the least known part of Canada. In 1893, accompanied by his brother, Mr.  J. W. Tyrrell, as his assistant, he traversed the so-called Barren  Grounds from Lake Athabasca eastward to Chesterfield Inlet, and from  there his party paddled in canoes down the west shore of Hudson Bay to  Fort Churchill. Of the 3200 miles thus traversed, 1650 were previously  unsurveyed and unmapped. From Fort Churchill Mr. Tyrrell walked eight or  nine hundred miles on snowshoes to the southern end of Lake Winnipeg. In  1894 he again crossed the Barren Grounds, this time travelling from the  north end of Reindeer Lake to a point on Hudson Bay, about 200 miles  south-west of Chesterfield Inlet. Thence he went to Churchill as before  in canoes along the open coast. From Churchill Mr. Tyrrell again, but by  another route, walked on showshoes to the southern end of Lake Winnipeg.  On this journey he travelled about 2900 miles, of which 1750 were by  canoe and 750 on snowshoes. Almost the whole journey was through  previously unexplored country. For the geographical work done in these  two years he was awarded the Back Premium by the Royal Geographical  Society of London.    In response to an enquiry whether any other white man has visited the  regions described by Hearne, Mr. Tyrrell writes:--        \"I happen to be the only one since Hearne who has conducted      explorations in the country lying between Fort Churchill and the      eastern end of Great Slave Lake and south of latitude 63 deg. N.      Except Hearne, I and those who accompanied and assisted me are      the only white men who have crossed that great stretch of      country, north of a line between the mouth of the Churchill      River and Lake Athabasca and a line between the east end of      Great Slave Lake and Chesterfield Inlet. Absolutely the only      information that I had about the region when I visited it, other      than what I had secured in conversation with Indians, was      contained in Hearne's book. My last journey was made sixteen      years ago, and no white man has since travelled across that      country. With the building of the railroad to Fort Churchill, it      will doubtless soon be visited. Since I made a survey of      Chesterfield Inlet and its vicinity, my brother, Mr. J. W.      Tyrrell, has crossed from the east end of Great Slave Lake by      the Hanbury River to Chesterfield Inlet, making a survey as he      went, and the Royal North West Mounted Police have sent parties      from the Mackenzie River to Hudson Bay along this route, using      my brother's maps as their guide. It is hardly necessary to say      that a magnificent field for exploration is still left in that      far northern country.\"    So much as to Mr. Tyrrell's work. For the notes explaining Hearne's many  observations on natural history we are indebted to Mr. E. A. Preble of  Washington. Mr. Preble spent a summer on the west shore of Hudson Bay  north of Fort Churchill. He also spent the summers of 1901 and 1903, the  winter of 1903-4, and the summers of 1904 and 1907 on the Athabasca and  Mackenzie Rivers and on the Barren Grounds north of Great Slave Lake.  This most important study of the fauna of Northern Canada was undertaken  by Mr. Preble on behalf of the Biological Survey of the United States  Department of Agriculture. The various reports and other publications  arising from the journeys of Mr. Tyrrell and the investigations of Mr.  Preble are mentioned in a bibliographical note at the end of this  volume.    This is the first work relating to the West to be published by the  Champlain Society. It has already begun an extensive list of the works  of early writers on Eastern Canada. The year 1911 will, it is hoped, see  the completion of the three volumes of Lescarbot's _History of New  France_, now for the first time entirely translated into English. In  this as in all other publications of the Society the original text is  given with the translation. Nicolas Denys was the first writer to  describe in detail the coasts of eastern Canada, and the Society has  republished his great book, adequately translated and with copious  notes. It has done the same with Le Clercq's account of Gaspe and its  interesting natives. The writings of Champlain, entirely translated into  English for the first time, will soon appear in six volumes. The regions  lying west of Lake Superior have a history as interesting, but the  material is scattered. Hearne's _Journal_ makes a good beginning. In  preparation are the _Journals_ of La Verendrye, the first white man to  come in sight of the Rocky Mountains by an overland route. His writings  will now for the first time be translated into English. The Society is  sparing no pains to provide volumes bearing on the Hudson's Bay Company.  Much further work on examining and classifying the papers of the Company  will, however, be necessary before anything final can be done. Meanwhile  members will enjoy the pleasant narrative of Hearne edited by the  competent observers whose services the Society has had the good fortune  to secure.    TORONTO, _January 1911_.

LIPPINCOTT COMPANY, PHILADELPHIA,    U.S.A.            THIS WORK IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO THE    OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE FIRST CORPS OF THE ARMY    OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA      TO THE LIVING AND THE DEAD      In Memory of      THEIR BRAVE DEEDS, THEIR TOILS, THEIR TRIBULATIONS,    AND THEIR TRIUMPHS          PREFACE.      Immediately after the surrender of the Confederate armies engaged in the  war between the States, General Lee undertook to write of the campaigns of  the Army of Northern Virginia while under his command, and asked such  assistance as I could give in supplying reports, despatches, and letters  of his, the originals of which had been lost or destroyed. Under the  impression that they could not be put to better use, such as were then in  hand were packed and sent him. He gave up the work, and after a few years  his death made it impossible that the world should ever receive the  complete story of the Confederate campaigns in Virginia from the noble  mind that projected and controlled them.    Possibly, had I not expected our commander to write the history of those  campaigns, I should have written it myself a decade or so earlier than I  have done. But, personally, I am not sorry that I write of the war thirty  years after its close, instead of ten or twenty.    While I am so constituted, temperamentally, that I could view then almost  exactly as I do now the great struggle in which I bore a part, I do not  know that others, in any considerable number, might have so regarded it at  the earlier periods to which I refer.    I believe that now, more fully than then, the public is ready to receive,  in the spirit in which it is written, the story which I present.    It is not my purpose to philosophize upon the war, but I cannot refrain  from expressing my profound thankfulness that Providence has spared me to  such time as I can see the asperities of the great conflict softened, its  passions entering upon the sleep of oblivion, only its nobler--if less  immediate--results springing into virile and vast life. I believe there is  to-day, _because of the war_, a broader and deeper patriotism in all  Americans; that patriotism throbs the heart and pulses the being as  ardently of the South Carolinian as of the Massachusetts Puritan; that the  Liberty Bell, even now, as I write, on its Southern pilgrimage, will be as  reverently received and as devotedly loved in Atlanta and Charleston as in  Philadelphia and Boston. And to stimulate and evolve this noble sentiment  all the more, what we need is the resumption of fraternity, the hearty  restoration and cordial cultivation of neighborly, brotherly relations,  faith in Jehovah, and respect for each other; and God grant that the happy  vision that delighted the soul of the sweet singer of Israel may rest like  a benediction upon the North and the South, upon the Blue and the Gray.    The spirit in which this work has been conceived, and in which I have  conscientiously labored to carry it out, is one of sincerity and fairness.  As an actor in, and an eyewitness of, the events of 1861-65, I have  endeavored to perform my humble share of duty in passing the materials of  history to those who may give them place in the records of the  nation,--not of the South nor of the North,--but in the history of the  United Nation. It is with such magnified view of the responsibility of  saying the truth that I have written.    I yield to no one as a champion of the Southern soldier wherever he may  have fought and in whatever army, and I do not think I shall be charged  more now than in war-time with \"underestimating the enemy.\" Honor to all!  If I speak with some particularity of the First Corps of the Army of  Northern Virginia, it must be ascribed in part to the affection of a  commander, and in part to my desire to relieve its brave officers and men  in the ranks from unjust aspersions. After General Lee's death, various  writers on the Southern cause combined with one accord to hold the First  Corps and its commander responsible for all adversity that befell the  army. I being under the political ban, and the political passions and  prejudices of the times running high, they had no difficulty in spreading  their misrepresentations South and North until some people, through their  mere reiteration, came to accept them as facts. I simply present the facts  concerning the First Corps in all fulness and fairness, attested by  indisputable authorities, that the public may judge between it and its  detractors.    In the accounts of battles and movements, the official War Records supply  in a measure the place of lost papers, and afford a great mass of most  trustworthy statistics. I am under obligations to General E. P. Alexander,  General G. M. Sorrel, Colonel Osman Latrobe, Colonel J. W. Fairfax,  Colonel T. J. Goree, Colonel Erasmus Taylor, and Colonel J. C. Haskell for  many interesting suggestions.    To Major George B. Davis and Mr. L. J. Perry, of the War Records office, I  am under obligations for invaluable assistance; as also to Mr. Alfred  Matthews, of Philadelphia, for material aid in revising the manuscript of  these memoirs.
