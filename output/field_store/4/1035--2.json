[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31547"],[0,"Youth (#1)"],[1,"_by_ ISAAC ASIMOV          Red and Slim found the two strange little animals the morning after      they heard the thunder sounds. They knew that they could never show      their new pets to their parents.      [Illustration]      There was a spatter of pebbles against the window and the youngster  stirred in his sleep. Another, and he was awake.    He sat up stiffly in bed. Seconds passed while he interpreted his  strange surroundings. He wasn't in his own home, of course. This was out  in the country. It was colder than it should be and there was green at  the window.    \"Slim!\"    The call was a hoarse, urgent whisper, and the youngster bounded to the  open window.    Slim wasn't his real name, but the new friend he had met the day before  had needed only one look at his slight figure to say, \"You're Slim.\" He  added, \"I'm Red.\"    Red wasn't his real name, either, but its appropriateness was obvious.  They were friends instantly with the quick unquestioning friendship of  young ones not yet quite in adolescence, before even the first stains of  adulthood began to make their appearance.    Slim cried, \"Hi, Red!\" and waved cheerfully, still blinking the sleep  out of himself.    Red kept to his croaking whisper, \"Quiet! You want to wake somebody?\"    Slim noticed all at once that the sun scarcely topped the low hills in  the east, that the shadows were long and soft, and that the grass was  wet.    Slim said, more softly, \"What's the matter?\"    Red only waved for him to come out.    Slim dressed quickly, gladly confining his morning wash to the momentary  sprinkle of a little lukewarm water. He let the air dry the exposed  portions of his body as he ran out, while bare skin grew wet against the  dewy grass.    Red said, \"You've got to be quiet. If Mom wakes up or Dad or your Dad or  even any of the hands then it'll be 'Come on in or you'll catch your  death of cold.'\"    He mimicked voice and tone faithfully, so that Slim laughed and thought  that there had never been so funny a fellow as Red.    Slim said, eagerly, \"Do you come out here every day like this, Red? Real  early? It's like the whole world is just yours, isn't it, Red? No one  else around and all like that.\" He felt proud at being allowed entrance  into this private world.    Red stared at him sidelong. He said carelessly, \"I've been up for hours.  Didn't you hear it last night?\"    \"Hear what?\"    \"Thunder.\"    \"Was there a thunderstorm?\" Slim never slept through a thunderstorm.    \"I guess not. But there was thunder. I heard it, and then I went to the  window and it wasn't raining. It was all stars and the sky was just  getting sort of almost gray. You know what I mean?\"    Slim had never seen it so, but he nodded.    \"So I just thought I'd go out,\" said Red.    They walked along the grassy side of the concrete road that split the  panorama right down the middle all the way down to where it vanished  among the hills. It was so old that Red's father couldn't tell Red when  it had been built. It didn't have a crack or a rough spot in it.    Red said, \"Can you keep a secret?\"    \"Sure, Red. What kind of a secret?\"    \"Just a secret. Maybe I'll tell you and maybe I won't. I don't know  yet.\" Red broke a long, supple stem from a fern they passed,  methodically stripped it of its leaflets and swung what was left  whip-fashion. For a moment, he was on a wild charger, which reared and  champed under his iron control. Then he got tired, tossed the whip aside  and stowed the charger away in a corner of his imagination for future  use.    He said, \"There'll be a circus around.\"    Slim said, \"That's no secret. I knew that. My Dad told me even before we  came here--\"    \"That's not the secret. Fine secret! Ever see a circus?\"    \"Oh, sure. You bet.\"    \"Like it?\"    \"Say, there isn't anything I like better.\"    Red was watching out of the corner of his eyes again. \"Ever think you  would like to be with a circus? I mean, for good?\"    Slim considered, \"I guess not. I think I'll be an astronomer like my  Dad. I think he wants me to be.\"    \"Huh! Astronomer!\" said Red.    Slim felt the doors of the new, private world closing on him and  astronomy became a thing of dead stars and black, empty space.    He said, placatingly, \"A circus _would_ be more fun.\"    \"You're just saying that.\"    \"No, I'm not. I mean it.\"    Red grew argumentative. \"Suppose you had a chance to join the circus  right now. What would you do?\"    \"I--I--\"    \"See!\" Red affected scornful laughter.    Slim was stung. \"I'd join up.\"    \"Go on.\"    \"Try me.\"    Red whirled at him, strange and intense. \"You meant that? You want to go  in with me?\"    [Illustration]    \"What do you mean?\" Slim stepped back a bit, surprised by the unexpected  challenge.    \"I got something that can get us into the circus. Maybe someday we can  even have a circus of our own. We could be the biggest circus-fellows in  the world. That's if you want to go in with me. Otherwise--Well, I guess  I can do it on my own. I just thought: Let's give good old Slim a  chance.\"    The world was strange and glamorous, and Slim said, \"Sure thing, Red.  I'm in! What is it, huh, Red? Tell me what it is.\"    \"Figure it out. What's the most important thing in circuses?\"    Slim thought desperately. He wanted to give the right answer. Finally,  he said, \"Acrobats?\"    \"Holy Smokes! I wouldn't go five steps to look at acrobats.\"    \"I don't know then.\"    \"Animals, that's what! What's the best side-show? Where are the biggest  crowds? Even in the main rings the best acts are animal acts.\" There was  no doubt in Red's voice.    \"Do you think so?\"    \"Everyone thinks so. You ask anyone. Anyway, I found animals this  morning. Two of them.\"    \"And you've got them?\"    \"Sure. That's the secret. Are you telling?\"    \"Of course not.\"    \"Okay. I've got them in the barn. Do you want to see them?\"    They were almost at the barn; its huge open door black. Too black. They  had been heading there all the time. Slim stopped in his tracks.    He tried to make his words casual. \"Are they big?\"    \"Would I fool with them if they were big? They can't hurt you. They're  only about so long. I've got them in a cage.\"    They were in the barn now and Slim saw the large cage suspended from a  hook in the roof. It was covered with stiff canvas.    Red said, \"We used to have some bird there or something. Anyway, they  can't get away from there. Come on, let's go up to the loft.\"    They clambered up the wooden stairs and Red hooked the cage toward them.    Slim pointed and said, \"There's sort of a hole in the canvas.\"    Red frowned. \"How'd that get there?\" He lifted the canvas, looked in,  and said, with relief, \"They're still there.\"    \"The canvas appeared to be burned,\" worried Slim.    \"You want to look, or don't you?\"    Slim nodded slowly. He wasn't sure he wanted to, after all. They might  be--    But the canvas had been jerked off and there they were. Two of them, the  way Red said. They were small, and sort of disgusting-looking. The  animals moved quickly as the canvas lifted and were on the side toward  the youngsters. Red poked a cautious finger at them.    \"Watch out,\" said Slim, in agony.    \"They don't hurt you,\" said Red. \"Ever see anything like them?\"    \"No.\"    \"Can't you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these?\"    \"Maybe they're too small for a circus.\"    Red looked annoyed. He let go the cage which swung back and forth  pendulum-fashion. \"You're just trying to back out, aren't you?\"    \"No, I'm not. It's just--\"    \"They're not too small, don't worry. Right now, I've only got one  worry.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"Well, I've got to keep them till the circus comes, don't I? I've got  to figure out what to feed them meanwhile.\"    The cage swung and the little trapped creatures clung to its bars,  gesturing at the youngsters with queer, quick motions--almost as though  they were intelligent.      II    The Astronomer entered the dining room with decorum. He felt very much  the guest.    He said, \"Where are the youngsters? My son isn't in his room.\"    The Industrialist smiled. \"They've been out for hours. However,  breakfast was forced into them among the women some time ago, so there  is nothing to worry about. Youth, Doctor, youth!\"    \"Youth!\" The word seemed to depress the Astronomer.    They ate breakfast in silence. The Industrialist said once, \"You really  think they'll come. The day looks so--_normal_.\"    The Astronomer said, \"They'll come.\"    That was all.    Afterward the Industrialist said, \"You'll pardon me. I can't conceive  your playing so elaborate a hoax. You really spoke to them?\"    \"As I speak to you. At least, in a sense. They can project thoughts.\"    \"I gathered that must be so from your letter. How, I wonder.\"    \"I could not say. I asked them and, of course, they were vague. Or  perhaps it was just that I could not understand. It involves a projector  for the focussing of thought and, even more than that, conscious  attention on the part of both projector and receptor. It was quite a  while before I realized they were trying to think at me. Such  thought-projectors may be part of the science they will give us.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said the Industrialist. \"Yet think of the changes it would  bring to society. A thought-projector!\"    \"Why not? Change would be good for us.\"    \"I don't think so.\"    \"It is only in old age that change is unwelcome,\" said the Astronomer,  \"and races can be old as well as individuals.\"    The Industrialist pointed out the window. \"You see that road. It was  built Beforethewars. I don't know exactly when. It is as good now as the  day it was built. We couldn't possibly duplicate it now. The race was  young when that was built, eh?\"    \"Then? Yes! At least they weren't afraid of new things.\"    \"No. I wish they had been. Where is the society of Beforethewars?  Destroyed, Doctor! What good were youth and new things? We are better  off now.

Approx. 1/3 natural size.]          A Taxonomic Study of the Middle American Snake, Pituophis deppei    BY    WILLIAM E. DUELLMAN      INTRODUCTION    As a part of a study of the herpetofauna of the Mexican state of  Michoac['a]n an attempt was made to ascertain the interspecific and  intraspecific relationships of the various populations of _Pituophis_  there. Field work in Michoac['a]n revealed that two supposed subspecies  of _Pituophis deppei_ were sympatric. This discovery led to the  examination of all available (124) museum specimens of these snakes.    I am grateful to the following persons who permitted me to examine  specimens in their care: Charles M. Bogert, American Museum of Natural  History (AMNH); Doris M. Cochran, United States National Museum (USNM);  Norman Hartweg, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ); Robert  F. Inger, Chicago Natural History Museum (CNHM); Arthur Loveridge,  Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ); Hobart M. Smith, University of  Illinois Museum of Natural History (UIMNH); and Edward H. Taylor, E. H.  Taylor--H. M. Smith collection (EHT-HMS). Specimens in the accounts of  the species are listed after the abbreviations of the institutions given  in parentheses above.      HISTORICAL REVIEW    Dum['e]ril (1853: 453) described _Elaphis deppei_ from a specimen in the  Leiden Museum from \"Mexico.\" This specimen, according to the type  description, has 233 ventrals and 67 caudals. In 1863 Jan described  _Pituophis deppei_ var. _pholidostictus_, also with \"Mexico\" as the type  locality. Subsequent authors (see synonymy of _P. deppei deppei_ in  Stull, 1940: 25) have treated _pholidostictus_ as a synonym of _deppei_.  Smith and Taylor (1950: 334) restricted the type localities of _deppei_  and _pholidostictus_ to San Juan Teotihuac['a]n, M['e]xico. Cope (1860:  369) described _Arizona jani_ on the basis of a specimen in the United  States National Museum from Buena Vista, Coahuila. Stull (1932: 2, 1940:  42), Smith (1944: 145) and Smith and Taylor (1945: 107) considered  _jani_ as a northern subspecies of _Pituophis deppei_. _Arizona  lineaticollis_ was described by Cope (1861: 300); the type, which  originally was in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and is  now lost, was said to have come from Jalapa, Veracruz. This locality  probably is in error. Smith (1943: 460) placed _lineaticollis_ as a  southern subspecies of _deppei_. Schmidt and Shannon (1947: 79)  described _Pituophis deppei brevilineata_ on the basis of five specimens  from Tanc['i]taro, Michoac['a]n, and Stuart (1954: 172) described  _Pituophis deppei gibsoni_ from seven specimens from Departamento  Chimaltenango, Guatemala. Thus, at present five subspecies of _Pituophis  deppei_ are recognized.      CHARACTERS STUDIED    Snakes currently assigned to _Pituophis deppei_ differ from other  members of the genus by possessing two instead of four prefrontal  plates. The subspecies of _P. deppei_ have been defined on characters of  coloration and scutellation.    _Scutellation._--The only scale characters utilized in the present study  are the numbers of ventrals and caudals. The number of ventrals varies  in the total sample from 210 to 246 (Table 1); usually the variation in  one locality is no more than 15. Number of caudals varies from 52 to 72.  There is slight sexual dimorphism in the number of ventrals and somewhat  greater differences in the number of caudals.

Number of blotches, color of blotches posteriorly,  width of pale interspaces between anterior blotches, and color of  lateral intercalary spots vary considerably geographically. In some  populations (_lineaticollis_ and _gibsoni_) the anterior blotches are  divided medially forming either a pair of dark stripes on the anterior  part of the body or a series of paired spots. Details of coloration are  described in the following accounts.      ACCOUNTS OF THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES    [Illustration: FIG. 1. M['e]xico and Guatemala showing the distribution  of the subspecies of _Pituophis deppei_ and _P. lineaticollis_.]    Study of _Pituophis deppei_ (_auctorum_) revealed the presence of  sympatric populations of two distinct species of _Pituophis_ differing  from each other in scutellation and coloration. The nomenclature  resulting from the required rearrangement necessitates the recognition  of 1) _deppei_ as a species, 2) _jani_ as a subspecies of _deppei_, 3)  _lineaticollis_ (with _brevilineata_ as a synonym) as a species distinct  from _deppei_, and 4) _gibsoni_ as a subspecies of _lineaticollis_.
