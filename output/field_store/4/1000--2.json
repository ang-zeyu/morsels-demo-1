This document (the Jargon File) is in the public domain, to be freely     used, shared, and modified. There are (by intention) no legal     restraints on what you can do with it, but there are traditions about     its proper use to which many hackers are quite strongly attached.     Please extend the courtesy of proper citation when you quote the File,     ideally with a version number, as it will change and grow over time.     (Examples of appropriate citation form: \"Jargon File 4.2.2\" or \"The     on-line hacker Jargon File, version 4.2.2, 20 AUG 2000\".)       The Jargon File is a common heritage of the hacker culture. Over the     years a number of individuals have volunteered considerable time to     maintaining the File and been recognized by the net at large as     editors of it. Editorial responsibilities include: to collate     contributions and suggestions from others; to seek out corroborating     information; to cross-reference related entries; to keep the file in a     consistent format; and to announce and distribute updated versions     periodically. Current volunteer editors include:       Eric Raymond [5]esr@snark.thyrsus.com       Although there is no requirement that you do so, it is considered good     form to check with an editor before quoting the File in a published     work or commercial product. We may have additional information that     would be helpful to you and can assist you in framing your quote to     reflect not only the letter of the File but its spirit as well.       All contributions and suggestions about this file sent to a volunteer     editor are gratefully received and will be regarded, unless otherwise     labelled, as freely given donations for possible use as part of this     public-domain file.       From time to time a snapshot of this file has been polished, edited,     and formatted for commercial publication with the cooperation of the     volunteer editors and the hacker community at large. If you wish to     have a bound paper copy of this file, you may find it convenient to     purchase one of these. They often contain additional material not     found in on-line versions. The two `authorized' editions so far are     described in the Revision History section; there may be more in the     future.       * [6]Introduction: The purpose and scope of this File       * [7]A Few Terms: Of Slang, Jargon and Techspeak       * [8]Revision History: How the File came to be       * [9]Jargon Construction: How hackers invent jargon       * [10]Hacker Writing Style: How they write       * [11]Email Quotes: And the Inclusion Problem       * [12]Hacker Speech Style: How hackers talk       * [13]International Style: Some notes on usage outside the U.S.       * [14]Lamer-speak: Crackers, Phreaks, and Lamers       * [15]Pronunciation Guide: How to read the pronunciation keys       * [16]Other Lexicon Conventions: How to read lexicon entries       * [17]Format for New Entries: How to submit new entries for the File       * [18]The Jargon Lexicon: The lexicon itself       * [19]Appendix A: Hacker Folklore       * [20]Appendix B: A Portrait of J.

Though some technical material is     included for background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary;     what we describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for     fun, social communication, and technical debate.       The `hacker culture' is actually a loosely networked collection of     subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared     experiences, shared roots, and shared values. It has its own myths,     heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams. Because     hackers as a group are particularly creative people who define     themselves partly by rejection of `normal' values and working habits,     it has unusually rich and conscious traditions for an intentional     culture less than 40 years old.       As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold     their culture together -- it helps hackers recognize each other's     places in the community and expresses shared values and experiences.     Also as usual, not knowing the slang (or using it inappropriately)     defines one as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of all in hackish     vocabulary) possibly even a [26]suit. All human cultures use slang in     this threefold way -- as a tool of communication, and of inclusion,     and of exclusion.       Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps     in the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard     to detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are     code for shared states of consciousness. There is a whole range of     altered states and problem-solving mental stances basic to high-level     hacking which don't fit into conventional linguistic reality any     better than a Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher's `trompe l'oeil'     compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and hacker slang     encodes these subtleties in many unobvious ways. As a simple example,     take the distinction between a [27]kluge and an [28]elegant solution,     and the differing connotations attached to each. The distinction is     not only of engineering significance; it reaches right back into the     nature of the generative processes in program design and asserts     something important about two different kinds of relationship between     the hacker and the hack. Hacker slang is unusually rich in     implications of this kind, of overtones and undertones that illuminate     the hackish psyche.       But there is more. Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very     conscious and inventive in their use of language. These traits seem to     be common in young children, but the conformity-enforcing machine we     are pleased to call an educational system bludgeons them out of most     of us before adolescence. Thus, linguistic invention in most     subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious     process. Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a     game to be played for conscious pleasure. Their inventions thus     display an almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of     language-play with the discrimination of educated and powerful     intelligence. Further, the electronic media which knit them together     are fluid, `hot' connections, well adapted to both the dissemination     of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and superannuated     specimens. The results of this process give us perhaps a uniquely     intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action.       Hacker slang also challenges some common linguistic and     anthropological assumptions. For example, it has recently become     fashionable to speak of `low-context' versus `high-context'     communication, and to classify cultures by the preferred context level     of their languages and art forms. It is usually claimed that     low-context communication (characterized by precision, clarity, and     completeness of self-contained utterances) is typical in cultures     which value logic, objectivity, individualism, and competition; by     contrast, high-context communication (elliptical, emotive,     nuance-filled, multi-modal, heavily coded) is associated with cultures     which value subjectivity, consensus, cooperation, and tradition. What     then are we to make of hackerdom, which is themed around extremely     low-context interaction with computers and exhibits primarily     \"low-context\" values, but cultivates an almost absurdly high-context     slang style?       The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a     compilation of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the     surrounding culture -- and, in fact, this one is the latest version of     an evolving compilation called the `Jargon File', maintained by     hackers themselves for over 15 years. This one (like its ancestors) is     primarily a lexicon, but also includes topic entries which collect     background or sidelight information on hacker culture that would be     awkward to try to subsume under individual slang definitions.       Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that     the material be enjoyable to browse. Even a complete outsider should     find at least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is     amusingly thought-provoking. But it is also true that hackers use     humorous wordplay to make strong, sometimes combative statements about     what they feel. Some of these entries reflect the views of opposing     sides in disputes that have been genuinely passionate; this is     deliberate. We have not tried to moderate or pretty up these disputes;     rather we have attempted to ensure that everyone's sacred cows get     gored, impartially. Compromise is not particularly a hackish virtue,     but the honest presentation of divergent viewpoints is.       The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references     incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them. We have not felt it     either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30103"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's Note: Title added.             *       *       *       *       *                        BIRDS ILLUSTRATED BY COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY                  Vol. One       MARCH, 1897       No. 3             *       *       *       *       *              FROM: THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION.                           _STATE OF NEW YORK_                 _Department of Public Instruction_                      _SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE_                                    _Albany_ December 26, 1896.

I came from the  warm south, where I went last winter, to tell you that Springtime is  nearly here.    When I sing, the buds and flowers and grass all begin to whisper to one  another, \"Springtime is coming for we heard the Bluebird say so,\" and  then they peep out to see the warm sunshine. I perch beside them and  tell them of my long journey from the south and how I knew just when  to tell them to come out of their warm winter cradles. I am of the same  blue color as the violet that shows her pretty face when I sing, \"Summer  is coming, and Springtime is here.\"    I do not like the cities for they are black and noisy and full of those  troublesome birds called English Sparrows. I take my pretty mate and  out in the beautiful country we find a home. We build a nest of twigs,  grass and hair, in a box that the farmer puts up for us near his barn.    Sometimes we build in a hole in some old tree and soon there are tiny  eggs in the nest. I sing to my mate and to the good people who own  the barn. I heard the farmer say one day, \"Isn't it nice to hear the  Bluebird sing? He must be very happy.\" And I am, too, for by this time  there are four or five little ones in the nest.    Little Bluebirds are like little boys--they are always hungry. We work  hard to find enough for them to eat. We feed them nice fat worms and  bugs, and when their little wings are strong enough, we teach them how  to fly. Soon they are large enough to hunt their own food, and can take  care of themselves.    The summer passes, and when we feel the breath of winter we go south  again, for we do not like the cold.           *       *       *    THE BLUE BIRD.        I know the song that the Bluebird is singing      Out in the apple tree, where he is swinging.      Brave little fellow! the skies may be dreary,      Nothing cares he while his heart is so cheery.      Hark! how the music leaps out from his throat,      Hark! was there ever so merry a note?                  Listen a while, and you'll hear what he's saying,                Up in the apple tree swinging and swaying.                \"Dear little blossoms down under the snow,                You must be weary of winter, I know;                Hark! while I sing you a message of cheer,                Summer is coming, and springtime is here!\"        \"Dear little snow-drop! I pray you arise;      Bright yellow crocus! come open your eyes;      Sweet little violets, hid from the cold,      Put on our mantles of purple and gold;      Daffodils! daffodils! say, do you hear,      Summer is coming! and springtime is here!\"    [Illustration: BLUE BIRD.]          THE BLUE BIRD.          Winged lute that we call a blue bird,          You blend in a silver strain      The sound of the laughing waters,          The patter of spring's sweet rain,      The voice of the wind, the sunshine,          And fragrance of blossoming things,      Ah! you are a poem of April          That God endowed with wings.      E. E. R.           *       *       *    Like a bit of sky this little harbinger of spring appears, as we see  him and his mate househunting in early March. Oftentimes he makes his  appearance as early as the middle of February, when his attractive note  is heard long before he himself is seen. He is one of the last to leave  us, and although the month of November is usually chosen by him as the  fitting time for departure to a milder clime, his plaintive note is  quite commonly heard on pleasant days throughout"]]]
