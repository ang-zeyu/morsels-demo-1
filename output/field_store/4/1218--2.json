[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4081"],[0,"The Alchemist (#1)"],[1,"ALCHEMIST      By Ben Jonson          INTRODUCTION    The greatest of English dramatists except Shakespeare, the first  literary dictator and poet-laureate, a writer of verse, prose,  satire, and criticism who most potently of all the men of his time  affected the subsequent course of English letters: such was Ben  Jonson, and as such his strong personality assumes an interest to  us almost unparalleled, at least in his age.    Ben Jonson came of the stock that was centuries after to give to  the world Thomas Carlyle; for Jonson's grandfather was of  Annandale, over the Solway, whence he migrated to England.  Jonson's father lost his estate under Queen Mary, \"having been cast  into prison and forfeited.\"  He entered the church, but died a  month before his illustrious son was born, leaving his widow and  child in poverty.  Jonson's birthplace was Westminster, and the  time of his birth early in 1573.  He was thus nearly ten years  Shakespeare's junior, and less well off, if a trifle better born.  But Jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage.  His  mother married beneath her, a wright or bricklayer, and Jonson was  for a time apprenticed to the trade.  As a youth he attracted the  attention of the famous antiquary, William Camden, then usher at  Westminster School, and there the poet laid the solid foundations  of his classical learning.  Jonson always held Camden in  veneration, acknowledging that to him he owed,    \"All that I am in arts, all that I know;\"    and dedicating his first dramatic success, \"Every Man in His  Humour,\" to him.  It is doubtful whether Jonson ever went to either  university, though Fuller says that he was \"statutably admitted  into St. John's College, Cambridge.\"  He tells us that he took no  degree, but was later \"Master of Arts in both the universities, by  their favour, not his study.\"  When a mere youth Jonson enlisted as  a soldier, trailing his pike in Flanders in the protracted wars of  William the Silent against the Spanish.  Jonson was a large and  raw-boned lad; he became by his own account in time exceedingly  bulky.  In chat with his friend William Drummond of Hawthornden,  Jonson told how \"in his service in the Low Countries he had, in the  face of both the camps, killed an enemy, and taken opima spolia  from him;\" and how \"since his coming to England, being appealed to  the fields, he had killed his adversary which had hurt him in the  arm and whose sword was ten inches longer than his.\"  Jonson's  reach may have made up for the lack of his sword; certainly his  prowess lost nothing in the telling.  Obviously Jonson was brave,  combative, and not averse to talking of himself and his doings.    In 1592, Jonson returned from abroad penniless.  Soon after he  married, almost as early and quite as imprudently as Shakespeare.  He told Drummond curtly that \"his wife was a shrew, yet honest\";  for some years he lived apart from her in the household of Lord  Albany.  Yet two touching epitaphs among Jonson's \"Epigrams,\" \"On  my first daughter,\" and \"On my first son,\" attest the warmth of the  poet's family affections.  The daughter died in infancy, the son of  the plague; another son grew up to manhood little credit to his  father whom he survived.  We know nothing beyond this of Jonson's  domestic life.    How soon Jonson drifted into what we now call grandly \"the  theatrical profession\" we do not know.  In 1593, Marlowe made his  tragic exit from life, and Greene, Shakespeare's other rival on the  popular stage, had preceded Marlowe in an equally miserable death  the year before.  Shakespeare already had the running to himself.  Jonson appears first in the employment of Philip Henslowe, the  exploiter of several troupes of players, manager, and father-in-law  of the famous actor, Edward Alleyn.  From entries in \"Henslowe's  Diary,\" a species of theatrical account book which has been handed  down to us, we know that Jonson was connected with the Admiral's  men; for he borrowed 4 pounds of Henslowe, July 28, 1597, paying  back 3s. 9d. on the same day on account of his \"share\" (in what is  not altogether clear); while later, on December 3, of the same  year, Henslowe advanced 20s. to him \"upon a book which he showed  the plot unto the company which he promised to deliver unto the  company at Christmas next.\"  In the next August Jonson was in  collaboration with Chettle and Porter in a play called \"Hot Anger  Soon Cold.\"  All this points to an association with Henslowe of  some duration, as no mere tyro would be thus paid in advance upon  mere promise.  From allusions in Dekker's play, \"Satiromastix,\" it  appears that Jonson, like Shakespeare, began life as an actor, and  that he \"ambled in a leather pitch by a play-wagon\" taking at one  time the part of Hieronimo in Kyd's famous play, \"The Spanish  Tragedy.\"  By the beginning of 1598, Jonson, though still in needy  circumstances, had begun to receive recognition.  Francis Meres--well  known for his \"Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with  the Greek, Latin, and Italian Poets,\" printed in 1598, and for his  mention therein of a dozen plays of Shakespeare by title--accords  to Ben Jonson a place as one of \"our best in tragedy,\" a matter of  some surprise, as no known tragedy of Jonson from so early a date  has come down to us.  That Jonson was at work on tragedy, however,  is proved by the entries in Henslowe of at least three tragedies,  now lost, in which he had a hand.  These are \"Page of Plymouth,\"  \"King Robert II. of Scotland,\" and \"Richard Crookback.\"  But all of  these came later, on his return to Henslowe, and range from August  1599 to June 1602.    Returning to the autumn of 1598, an event now happened to sever for  a time Jonson's relations with Henslowe.  In a letter to Alleyn,  dated September 26 of that year, Henslowe writes: \"I have lost one  of my company that hurteth me greatly; that is Gabriel [Spencer],  for he is slain in Hogsden fields by the hands of Benjamin Jonson,  bricklayer.\"  The last word is perhaps Henslowe's thrust at Jonson  in his displeasure rather than a designation of his actual  continuance at his trade up to this time.  It is fair to Jonson to  remark however, that his adversary appears to have been a notorious  fire-eater who had shortly before killed one Feeke in a similar  squabble.  Duelling was a frequent occurrence of the time among  gentlemen and the nobility; it was an impudent breach of the peace  on the part of a player.  This duel is the one which Jonson  described years after to Drummond, and for it Jonson was duly  arraigned at Old Bailey, tried, and convicted.  He was sent to  prison and such goods and chattels as he had \"were forfeited.\"  It  is a thought to give one pause that, but for the ancient law  permitting convicted felons to plead, as it was called, the benefit  of clergy, Jonson might have been hanged for this deed.  The  circumstance that the poet could read and write saved him; and he  received only a brand of the letter \"T,\" for Tyburn, on his left  thumb.  While in jail Jonson became a Roman Catholic; but he  returned to the faith of the Church of England a dozen years later.    On his release, in disgrace with Henslowe and his former  associates, Jonson offered his services as a playwright to  Henslowe's rivals, the Lord Chamberlain's company, in which  Shakespeare was a prominent shareholder.  A tradition of long  standing, though not susceptible of proof in a court of law,  narrates that Jonson had submitted the manuscript of \"Every Man in  His Humour\" to the Chamberlain's men and had received from the  company a refusal; that Shakespeare called him back, read the play  himself, and at once accepted it.  Whether this story is true or  not, certain it is that \"Every Man in His Humour\" was accepted by  Shakespeare's company and acted for the first time in 1598, with  Shakespeare taking a part.  The evidence of this is contained in  the list of actors prefixed to the comedy in the folio of Jonson's  works, 1616.  But it is a mistake to infer, because Shakespeare's  name stands first in the list of actors and the elder Kno'well  first in the dramatis personae, that Shakespeare took that  particular part.  The order of a list of Elizabethan players was  generally that of their importance or priority as shareholders in  the company and seldom if ever corresponded to the list of  characters.    \"Every Man in His Humour\" was an immediate success, and with it  Jonson's reputation as one of the leading dramatists of his time  was established once and for all.  This could have been by no means  Jonson's earliest comedy, and we have just learned that he was  already reputed one of \"our best in tragedy.\"  Indeed, one of  Jonson's extant comedies, \"The Case is Altered,\" but one never  claimed by him or published as his, must certainly have preceded  \"Every Man in His Humour\" on the stage.  The former play may be  described as a comedy modelled on the Latin plays of Plautus.  (It  combines, in fact, situations derived from the \"Captivi\" and the  \"Aulularia\" of that dramatist).  But the pretty story of the  beggar-maiden, Rachel, and her suitors, Jonson found, not among the  classics, but in the ideals of romantic love which Shakespeare had  already popularised on the stage.  Jonson never again produced so  fresh and lovable a feminine personage as Rachel, although in other  respects \"The Case is Altered\" is not a conspicuous play, and, save  for the satirising of Antony Munday in the person of Antonio  Balladino and Gabriel Harvey as well, is perhaps the least  characteristic of the comedies of Jonson.    \"Every Man in His Humour,\" probably first acted late in the summer  of 1598 and at the Curtain, is commonly regarded as an epoch-making  play; and this view is not unjustified.  As to plot, it tells  little more than how an intercepted letter enabled a father to  follow his supposedly studious son to London, and there observe his  life with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40817"],[0,"Dizionario storico-critico degli scrittori di musica e de' più celebri artisti, (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by The Internet Archive)                                DIZIONARIO DEGLI SCRITTORI DI MUSICA                                   A.  --  B.
