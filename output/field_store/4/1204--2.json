Pottery occasionally was made in the stylized form of animals such as  the mountain sheep. The silhouettes of sheep and deer persist as  pictographs or petroglyphs on walls of kivas and on rocks near  prehistoric dwellings. Mammalian bones from archeological sites reveal  that the fauna of Mesa Verde was much the same in A. D. 1200, when the  Pueblo Indians were building their magnificent cliff dwellings, as it is  today. One of the native mammals is the ubiquitous deer mouse,  _Peromyscus maniculatus_. The geographic range of this species includes  most of the United States, and large parts of Mexico and Canada.    Another species of the same genus, the pinyon mouse, _P. truei_, also  lives on the Mesa Verde. The pinyon mouse lives mostly in southwestern  North America, occurring from central Oregon and southern Wyoming to  northern Oaxaca. This species generally is associated with pinyon pine  trees, or with juniper trees, and where the pinyon-juniper woodland is  associated with rocky ground (Hoffmeister, 1951:vii).    _P. maniculatus rufinus_ of Mesa Verde was considered to be a mountain  subspecies by Osgood (1909:73). The center of dispersion for _P. truei_  was in the southwestern United States, and particularly in the Colorado  Plateau area (Hoffmeister, 1951:vii). The subspecies _P. truei truei_  occurs mainly in the Upper Sonoran life-zone, and according to  Hoffmeister (1951:30) rarely enters the Lower Sonoran or Transition  life-zones. _P. maniculatus_ and _P. truei_ are the most abundant of the  small mammals in Mesa Verde National Park, which comprises about  one-third of the Mesa Verde land mass.    Under the auspices of the Wetherill Mesa Archeological Project, the  flora of the park recently was studied by Erdman (1962), and by Welsh  and Erdman (1964). These studies have revealed stands of several  distinct types of vegetation in the park and where each type occurs.  This information greatly facilitated my study of the mammals inhabiting  each type of association. The flora and fauna within the park are  protected, in keeping with the policies of the National Park Service,  and mammals, therefore, could be studied in a relatively undisturbed  setting.    Thus, the abundance of these two species of _Peromyscus_, the botanical  studies that preceded and accompanied my study, the relatively  undisturbed nature of the park, and the availability of a large area in  which extended studies could be carried on, all contributed to the  desirability of Mesa Verde as a study area.    My primary purpose in undertaking a study of the two species of  _Peromyscus_ was to analyze a number of ecological factors influencing  each species--their habitat preferences, how the mice lived within their  habitats, what they ate, where they nested, what preyed on them, and how  one species influenced the distribution of the other. In general, my  interest was in how the lives of the two species impinge upon each other  in Mesa Verde.      Physiography    The Mesa Verde consists of about 200 square miles of plateau country in  southwestern Colorado, just northeast of Four Corners, where Colorado,  New Mexico, Arizona and Utah meet. In 1906, more than 51,000 acres of  the Mesa Verde were set aside, as Mesa Verde National Park, in order to  protect the cliff dwellings for which the area is famous.    The Mesa Verde land mass is composed of cross-bedded sandstone strata  laid down by Upper Cretaceous seas. These strata are known locally as  the Mesaverde group, and are composed, from top to bottom, of Cliff  House sandstone, the Menefee formation, the Point Lookout sandstone, the  well known Mancos shale, and the Dakota sandstone, the lowest member of  the Cretaceous strata. The Menefee formation is 340 to 800 feet thick,  and contains carbonaceous shale and beds of coal.    There are surface deposits of Pleistocene and Recent age, with gravel  and boulders of alluvial origin; colluvium composed of heterogeneous  rock detritus such as talus and landslide material; and alluvium  composed of soil, sand, and gravel. A layer of loess overlays the  bedrock of the flat mesa tops in the Four Corners area. The earliest  preserved loess is probably pre-Wisconsin, possibly Sangamon in age  (Arrhenius and Bonatti, 1965:99).    The North Rim of Mesa Verde rises majestically, 1,500 feet above the  surrounding Montezuma Valley. Elevations in the park range from 8,500  feet at Park Point to about 6,500 feet at the southern ends of the  mesas. The Mesa Verde land mass is the remnant of a plateau that erosion  has dissected into a series of long, narrow mesas, joined at their  northern ends, but otherwise separated by deep canyons. The bottoms of  these canyons are from 600 to 900 feet below the tops of the mesas.    The entire Mesa Verde land mass tilts southward; Park Headquarters, in  the middle of Chapin Mesa (Fig. 1), is at about the same elevation as is  the entrance of the park, 20 miles by road to the north.

Although the pinyon-juniper  woodland dominates the mesa tops, stands of Douglas fir occur in some  sheltered canyons and on north-facing slopes. Thickets of Gambel oak and  Utah serviceberry cover many hillsides and form a zone of brush at  higher elevations in the park. Aspens grow in small groups at the base  of the Point Lookout sandstone and at a few other sheltered places where  the supply of moisture suffices. Individual ponderosa pine are scattered  through the park, and stands of this species occur on some slopes and in  the bottoms of some sheltered canyons.

Originated by the Board of Admiralty, over which Viscount Melville  presided, these voyages have been carried on, since 1830, under his  lordship's successors in office.    Captain King has authorized me to lay the results of the Expedition which  he commanded, from 1826 to 1830, before your lordship, united to those of  the Beagle's subsequent voyages.      I have the honour to be,            MY LORD,      Your lordship's obedient servant,                    ROBERT FITZ-ROY.           *       *       *       *       *      {ix}    PREFACE.    In this Work, the result of nine years' voyaging, partly on coasts little  known, an attempt has been made to combine giving general information with  the paramount object--that of fulfilling a duty to the Admiralty, for the  benefit of Seamen.    Details, purely technical, have been avoided in the narrative more than I  could have wished; but some are added in the Appendix to each volume: and  in a nautical memoir, drawn up for the Admiralty, those which are here  omitted will be found.    There are a few words used frequently in the following pages, which may not  at first sight be familiar to every reader, therefore I need hardly  apologize for saying that, although the great Portuguese navigator's name  was Magalhaens--it is generally pronounced as if written Magellan:--that  the natives of Tierra del Fuego are commonly called Fuegians;--and that  Chil['o]e is thus accented for reasons given in page 384 of the second  volume.    In the absence of Captain King, who has entrusted to me the care of  publishing his share of this work, I may have overlooked errors which he  would have detected. Being hurried, and unwell, while attending to the  printing of his volume, I was not able to do it justice.    {x}    It may be a subject of regret, that no paper on the Botany of Tierra del  Fuego is appended to the first volume. Captain King took great pains in  forming and preserving a botanical collection, aided by a person embarked  solely for that purpose. He placed this collection in the British Museum,  and was led to expect that a first-rate botanist would have examined and  described it; but he has been disappointed.    In conclusion, I beg to remind the reader, that the work is unavoidably of  a rambling and very mixed character; that some parts may be wholly  uninteresting to most readers, though, perhaps, not devoid of interest to  all; and that its publication arises solely from a sense of duty.

London, March 1839.           *       *       *       *       *      {xi}    INTRODUCTION    In 1825, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty directed two ships to be  prepared for a Survey of the Southern Coasts of South America; and in May,  of the following year, the ADVENTURE and the BEAGLE were lying in Plymouth  Sound, ready to carry the orders of their Lordships into execution.    These vessels were well provided with every necessary, and every comfort,  which the liberality and kindness of the Admiralty, Navy Board, and  officers of the Dock-yards, could cause to be furnished.    On board the Adventure, a roomy ship, of 330 tons burthen, without guns,[1]  lightly though strongly rigged, and very strongly built, were--      PHILLIP PARKER KING, Commander and Surveyor, Senior    Officer of the Expedition.

Serjeant and fourteen Marines; and about forty Seamen and    Boys.    In the Beagle, a well-built little vessel, of 235 tons, rigged as a barque,  and carrying six guns, were--      PRINGLE STOKES          Commander and Surveyor.    E. HAWES                Lieutenant.    W. G. SKYRING           Lieut. and Assist. Surveyor.    S. S. FLINN             Master.    E. BOWEN                Surgeon.    J. ATRILL               Purser.    J. KIRKE                Mate.    B. BYNOE                Assistant Surgeon.    J. L. STOKES            Midshipman.    R. F. LUNIE             Volunteer 1st Class.    W.

Serjeant and nine Marines; and about forty Seamen and Boys.    {xiii}    In the course of the voyage, several changes occurred among the officers,  which it may be well to mention here.    In September, 1826, Lieutenant Hawes invalided: and was succeeded by Mr. R.  H. Sholl, the senior mate in the Expedition.    In February, 1827, Mr. Ainsworth was unfortunately drowned; and, in his  place, Mr. Williams acted, until superseded by Mr. S. S. Flinn, of the  Beagle.    Lieutenant Cooke invalided in June, 1827; and was succeeded by Mr. J. C.  Wickham.    In the same month Mr. Graves received information of his promotion to the  rank of Lieutenant.    Between May and December, 1827, Mr. Bowen and Mr. Atrill invalided; besides  Messrs. Lunie, Jones, and Macdouall: Mr. W. Mogg joined the Beagle, as  acting Purser; and Mr. D. Braily, as volunteer of the second class.    Mr. Bynoe acted as Surgeon of the Beagle, after Mr. Bowen left, until  December, 1828.    In August, 1828, Captain Stokes's lamented vacancy was temporarily filled  by Lieutenant Skyring; whose place was taken by Mr. Brand.    Mr. Flinn was then removed to the Adventure; and Mr. A. Millar put into his  place.    {xiv}    In December, 1828, the Commander-in-chief of the Station (Sir Robert Waller  Otway) superseded the temporary arrangements of Captain King, and appointed  a commander, lieutenant, master, and surgeon to the Beagle. Mr. Brand then  invalided, and the lists of officers stood thus--      Adventure (1828-30).      PHILLIP PARKER KING, Commander and Surveyor, Senior    Officer of the Expedition.      T.
