Letters of Franz Liszt, Volume 1, \"From Paris to Rome: Years of  Travel as a Virtuoso\"    by Franz Liszt; letters collected by La Mara and translated by  Constance Bache          CONTENTS        BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH  DEDICATION  PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION, BY CONSTANCE BACHE  TABLE OF LETTER CONTENTS  THE LETTERS OF FRANZ LISZT, VOL. 1  INFO ABOUT THIS E-TEXT EDITION        BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH        The Austrian composer Franz Liszt (1811-1886) was a pianistic  miracle. He could play anything on site and composed over 400  works centered around \"his\" instrument. Among his key works are  his Hungarian Rhapsodies, his Transcendental Etudes, his Concert  Etudes, his Etudes based on variations of Paganinini's Violin  Caprices and his Sonata, one of the most important of the  nineteenth century. He also wrote thousands of letters, of which  260 are translated into English in this first of a 2-volume set  of letters.    Those who knew him were also struck by his extremely  sophisticated personality. He was surely one of the most  civilized people of the nineteeth century, internalizing within  himself a complex conception of human civility, and attempting to  project it in his music and his communications with people. His  life was centered around people; he knew them, worked with them,  remembered them, thought about them, and wrote about them using  an almost poetic language, while pushing them to reflect the high  ideals he believed in. His personality was the embodiment of a  refined, idealized form of human civility. He was the consummate  musical artist, always looking for ways to communicate a new  civilized idea through music, and to work with other musicians in  organizing concerts and gatherings to perform the music publicly.  He also did as much as he could to promote and compliment those  whose music he believed in.    He was also a superlative musical critic, knowing, with few  mistakes, what music of his day was \"artistic\" and what was not.  But, although he was clearly a musical genius, he insisted on  projecting a tonal, romantic \"beauty\" in his music, confining his  music to a narrow range of moral values and ideals. He would have  rejected 20th-century music that entertained cynical notions of  any kind, or notions that obviated the concept of beauty in any  way. There is no Prokofiev, Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Cage, Adams  and certainly no Schoenberg in Liszt's music. His music has an  ideological \"ceiling,\" and that ceiling is \"beauty.\" It never  goes beyond that. And perhaps it was never as \"beautiful\" as the  music of Mozart, Bach or Beethoven, nor quite as rational (Are  all the emotions in Liszt's music truly \"controlled?\"). But it  certainly was original and instructive, and it certainly will  linger.        DEDICATION        To the Memory of  MY BROTHER WALTER,  AND TO OUR  DEAR AND HONORED FRIEND  A.J. HIPKINS, ESQ.,  I DEDICATE THIS TRANSLATION.    --C.B.        PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION, BY CONSTANCE BACHE        In writing a few words of Preface I wish to express, first and  foremost, my appreciation of the extreme care and  conscientiousness with which La Mara has prepared these volumes.  In a spirit of no less reverence I have endeavored, in the  English translation, to adhere as closely as possible to all the  minute characteristics that add expression to Liszt's letters:  punctuation has, of necessity, undergone alteration, but italics,  inverted commas, dashes and other marks have been strictly  observed. It may be objected that unnecessary particularity has  been shown in the translation of various titles, names of  Societies or newspapers, quotations, etc.; but there are many  people who, while understanding French, do not read German, and  vice versa, and therefore it has seemed better to translate  everything. Where anything has been omitted in the printed  letters I have adhered to the sign .--. employed by La Mara to  indicate the hiatus. It has seemed best to preserve the spelling  of all proper names as written by Liszt, and not to Anglicise  any, as it is impossible to do all; and therefore, even at the  risk of a seeming affectation, the original form of the name has  been preserved. In the same spirit I have adhered to the correct  form of the name of our adopted composer Handel, and trust I may  be pardoned for so doing on the strength of a little joke of  Liszt's own \"The English,\" he said, \"always talk about Gluck and  Handel!\"    La Mara says in her Preface that this collection can by no means  be considered a complete one, as there must exist other letters--  to Liszt's mother, to Berlioz, Tausig, etc.--which it is hoped  may yet be some day forthcoming. In like manner might there not  also be letters to his daughter Madame Ollivier (not to mention  his still-living daughter Madame Wagner)? [Another volume of  Liszt's letters, of a still more intimate character, addressed to  a lady friend, will be published later on.]    The English edition is increased by four letters one to Peter  Cornelius, No. 256A in Vol. I., which is interesting in its  reference to the \"Barbier\"; and, in Vol. II., a kind letter of  introduction which the Master gave me for Madame Tardieu, in  Brussels; one letter to Walter Bache, and one to the London  Philharmonic Society (Nos. 370A and 370B); one of these, it is  true, is partially quoted in a footnote by La Mara, but at this  distance of time there is no reason why these letters should not  be inserted entire, and they will prove of rather particular  interest, both to my brother's friends, and also as having  reference to that never-to-be-forgotten episode--Liszt's last  visit to England.    This visit, which took place in 1886, a few months before the  Master's death, was for the purpose of his being present at the  performance of his Oratorio of St. Elizabeth (see Letter 370 and  subsequent letters).    More than forty years had elapsed since Liszt's previous visit to  our shores; times had changed, and the almost unknown, and wholly  unappreciated, had become the acknowledged King in a realm where  many were Princes. Some lines embodying in words England's  welcome to this king--headed by a design in which the Hungarian  and the English coats-of-arms unite above two clasped hands, and  a few bars of a leading theme from the St. Elizabeth--were  written by me and presented to Liszt with a basket of roses  (emblematic of the rose miracle in the Oratorio) tied with the  Hungarian colors, on his entrance into St. James's Hall on April  6th, 1886.    As a memento of that occasion it has been chosen as frontispiece  to the Second Volume.
