Not bird skins in the drawers of a cabinet, it  will be understood, these being indispensable to the ornithologist, and  very useful to the larger class of persons who without being  ornithologists yet take an intelligent interest in birds. The  unpleasantness was at the sight of skins stuffed with wool and set up on  their legs in imitation of the living bird, sometimes (oh, mockery!) in  their \"natural surroundings.\" These \"surroundings\" are as a rule  constructed or composed of a few handfuls of earth to form the floor of  the glass case--sand, rock, clay, chalk, or gravel; whatever the  material may be it invariably has, like all \"matter out of place,\" a  grimy and depressing appearance. On the floor are planted grasses,  sedges, and miniature bushes, made of tin or zinc and then dipped in a  bucket of green paint. In the chapter referred to it was said, \"When the  eye closes in death, the bird, except to the naturalist, becomes a mere  bundle of dead feathers; crystal globes may be put into the empty  sockets, and a bold life-imitating attitude given to the stuffed  specimen, but the vitreous orbs shoot forth no life-like glances: the  'passion and the life whose fountains are within' have vanished, and the  best work of the taxidermist, who has given a life to his bastard art,  produces in the mind only sensations of irritation and disgust.\"    That, in the last clause, was wrongly writ. It should have been _my_  mind, and the minds of those who, knowing living birds intimately as I  do, have the same feeling about them.    This, then, being my feeling about stuffed birds, set up in their  \"natural surroundings,\" I very naturally avoid the places where they are  exhibited. At Brighton, for instance, on many occasions when I have  visited and stayed in that town, there was no inclination to see the  Booth Collection, which is supposed to be an ideal collection of British  birds; and we know it was the life-work of a zealous ornithologist who  was also a wealthy man, and who spared no pains to make it perfect of  its kind. About eighteen months ago I passed a night in the house of a  friend close to the Dyke Road, and next morning, having a couple of  hours to get rid of, I strolled into the museum. It was painfully  disappointing, for though no actual pleasure had been expected, the  distress experienced was more than I had bargained for. It happened that  a short time before, I had been watching the living Dartford warbler, at  a time when the sight of this small elusive creature is loveliest, for  not only was the bird in his brightest feathers, but his surroundings  were then most perfect--       The whin was frankincense and flame.    His appearance, as I saw him then and on many other occasions in  the furze-flowering season, is fully described in a chapter in  this book; but on this particular occasion while watching my bird  I saw it in a new and unexpected aspect, and in my surprise and  delight I exclaimed mentally, \"Now I have seen the furze wren at  his very best!\"    It was perhaps a very rare thing--one of those effects of light on  plumage which we are accustomed to see in birds that have glossed  metallic feathers, and, more rarely, in other kinds. Thus the  turtle-dove when flying from the spectator with a strong  sunlight on its upper plumage, sometimes at a distance of two to  three hundred yards, appears of a shining whiteness.    I had been watching the birds for a couple of hours, sitting quite  still on a tuft of heather among the furze-bushes, and at  intervals they came to me, impelled by curiosity and solicitude,  their nests being near, but, ever restless, they would never  remain more than a few seconds at a time in sight. The prettiest  and the boldest was a male, and it was this bird that in the end  flew to a bush within twelve yards of where I sat, and perching on  a spray about on a level with my eyes exhibited himself to me in  his characteristic manner, the long tail raised, crest erect,  crimson eye sparkling, and throat puffed out with his little  scolding notes. But his colour was no longer that of the furze  wren: seen at a distance the upper plumage always appears  slaty-black; near at hand it is of a deep slaty-brown; now it was  dark, sprinkled or frosted over with a delicate greyish-white, the  white of oxidised silver; and this rare and beautiful appearance  continued for a space of about twenty seconds; but no sooner did  he flit to another spray than it vanished, and he was once  more the slaty-brown little bird with a chestnut-red breast.    It is unlikely that I shall ever again see the furze wren in this  aspect, with a curious splendour wrought by the sunlight in the  dark but semi-translucent delicate feathers of his mantle; but its  image is in the mind, and, with a thousand others equally  beautiful, remains to me a permanent possession.    As I went in to see the famous Booth Collection, a thought of the  bird I have just described came into my mind; and glancing round  the big long room with shelves crowded with stuffed birds, like  the crowded shelves of a shop, to see where the Dartford warblers  were, I went straight to the case and saw a group of them fastened  to a furze-bush, the specimens twisted by the stuffer into a  variety of attitudes--ancient, dusty, dead little birds, painful to  look at--a libel on nature and an insult to a man's intelligence.    It was a relief to go from this case to the others, which were not  of the same degree of badness, but all, like the furze wrens, were  in their natural surroundings--the pebbles, bit of turf, painted  leaves, and what not, and, finally, a view of the wide world  beyond, the green earth and the blue sky, all painted on  the little square of deal or canvas which formed the back of the  glass case.    Listening to the talk of other visitors who were making the round  of the room, I heard many sincere expressions of admiration: they  were really pleased and thought it all very wonderful. That is, in  fact, the common feeling which most persons express in such  places, and, assuming that it is sincere, the obvious explanation  is that they know no better. They have never properly seen  anything in nature, but have looked always with mind and the inner  vision preoccupied with other and familiar things--indoor scenes  and objects, and scenes described in books. If they had ever  looked at wild birds properly--that is to say, emotionally--the  images of such sights would have remained in their minds; and,  with such a standard for comparison, these dreary remnants of dead  things set before them as restorations and as semblances of life  would have only produced a profoundly depressing effect.    We hear of the educational value of such exhibitions,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37809"],[0,"A Taxonomic Revision of the Leptodactylid Frog Genus Syrrhophus Cope (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                     UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS   MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY     Vol. 20, No. 1, pp. 1-45, 22 figs.

LYNCH          INTRODUCTION      Cope (1878) proposed the genus _Syrrhophus_ for a medium-sized  leptodactylid frog from central Texas; in the ensuing 75 years the genus  was expanded to include a heterogeneous group of frogs ranging from  Texas to Peru. Taylor (1952) and Firschein (1954) limited the genus to  several species of frogs occurring in Guatemala, Mexico, and Texas.  Lynch (1968) provided a definition of the previously loosely-defined  genus.    With the exception of Taylor (1952), who treated the Costa Rican  species, none of these authors dealt with the present status of the  nineteen species erroneously assigned to _Syrrhophus_. These species are  listed in Tables 1 and 2 with the name currently applied. Some of them  are new combinations and their justifications will be published  elsewhere. Gorham (1966) is the most recent author to include South  American species in the genus _Syrrhophus_.    Smith and Taylor (1948) recognized two species groups of the genus in  Mexico, an eastern and a western group (here termed complexes for  purposes of discussion), separated on the basis of the number of palmar  (metacarpal) tubercles (three palmar tubercles in the members of the  eastern complex and two in those of the western complex). Duellman  (1958) reviewed the species of the genus occurring in western Mexico and  concluded that there were five species (two polytypic). Dixon and Webb  (1966) described an additional species from Jalisco, Mexico. The  distributions of some species have been extended, but otherwise the  western complex of species remains unchanged since Duellman's review.    Smith and Taylor (1948) recognized seven species of the genus in eastern  Mexico. Firschein revised the eastern complex (as then understood), and  in so doing added one new species and treated _Syrrhophus verruculatus_  as a _nomen dubium_. Dixon (1957) redefined the related genus  _Tomodactylus_ and transferred _T. macrotympanum_ Taylor to the genus  _Syrrhophus_. Neill (1965) described a new subspecies of _S. leprus_  from British Honduras. Two species (_S. gaigeae_ and _S. marnockii_)  were recognized in Texas until Milstead, Mecham, and McClintock (1950)  synonymized _S. gaigeae_ with _S. marnockii_. Thus, at present, nine  species (one polytypic) are recognized on the eastern slopes and  lowlands from central Texas to British Honduras. These are currently  placed on one species group equivalent to the western complex reviewed  by Duellman (1958).

It soon became evident that there were more names  than species, that some previously regarded species were geographic  variants, and that the eastern and western groups (complexes here) were  artificial divisions of the genus. I conclude that there are seven  species (one polytypic) of _Syrrhophus_ in eastern Mexico, Texas, and El  Peten of Guatemala, and seven species (one polytypic) in western Mexico.  The current status of each of the 23 names correctly assigned to the  genus is presented in Table 3.    The fourteen species recognized by me are placed in five species groups.  Two of these groups are presently placed in the western complex  (_modestus_ and _pipilans_ groups) and three in the eastern complex  (_leprus_, _longipes_ and _marnockii_ groups). The two complexes do  not correspond exactly with the eastern and western groups of Smith  and Taylor (1948), Firschein (1954), and Duellman (1958) since  _S. rubrimaculatus_ is now associated with the eastern _leprus_ group.    The definitions and contents of the five species groups are as follows:      _leprus_ group: digital pads not or only slightly expanded, rounded       in outline; first finger longer or shorter than second; snout       acuminate or subacuminate, not rounded; outer metatarsal tubercle       conical; digits lacking distinct lateral fringes.         content: _cystignathoides_, _leprus_ and _rubrimaculatus_.      _longipes_ group: digital pads widely expanded, triangular in outline;       first finger shorter than second; snout acuminate; outer metatarsal       tubercle not conical; digits bearing lateral fringes.         content: _dennisi_ and _longipes_.      _marnockii_ group: digital pads expanded, rounded to truncate in       outline; first finger equal in length to second or slightly shorter;       snout rounded; outer metatarsal tubercle not conical; digits lacking       lateral fringes; generally stout-bodied frogs.         content: _guttilatus_, _marnockii_, and _verrucipes_.      _modestus_ group: digital pads expanded, truncate in outline; first and       second fingers subequal in length, first usually slightly shorter       than second; snout subacuminate; inner metatarsal tubercle twice as       large (or larger) as outer metatarsal tubercle; digits bearing       poorly-defined lateral fringes.         content: _interorbitalis_, _modestus_, _nivocolimae_, _pallidus_,       and _teretistes_.      _pipilans_ group: digital pads not or only slightly expanded,       truncate in outline; first finger equal in length to second; snout       subacuminate; metatarsal tubercles subequal in size; digits lacking       lateral fringes.         content: _pipilans_."]]]
