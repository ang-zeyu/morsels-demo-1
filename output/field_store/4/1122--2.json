Lethaby    DRESS DESIGN      [Illustration: A Long-trained Muslin Dress. About 1800.]      DRESS DESIGN    An Account of Costume  for Artists & Dressmakers    by    TALBOT HUGHES    Illustrated by the Author from  Old Examples . Together  with 35 Pages of Half-Tone Illustrations                London  Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, Ltd.  Bath, Melbourne, Toronto, and New York    Reprinted 1920          GENERAL PREFACE TO THE SERIES      In issuing this volume of a series of Handbooks on the Artistic Crafts,  it will be well to state what are our general aims.    In the first place, we wish to provide trustworthy text-books of  workshop practice, from the points of view of experts who have  critically examined the methods current in the shops, and putting aside  vain survivals, are prepared to say what is good workmanship, and to set  up a standard of quality in the crafts which are more especially  associated with design. Secondly, in doing this, we hope to treat design  itself as an essential part of good workmanship. During the last century  most of the arts, save painting and sculpture of an academic kind, were  little considered, and there was a tendency to look on \"design\" as a  mere matter of _appearance_. Such \"ornamentation\" as there was was  usually obtained by following in a mechanical way a drawing provided by  an artist who often knew little of the technical processes involved in  production. With the critical attention given to the crafts by Ruskin  and Morris, it came to be seen that it was impossible to detach design  from craft in this way, and that, in the widest sense, true design is an  inseparable element of good quality, involving as it does the selection  of good and suitable material, contrivance for special purpose, expert  workmanship, proper finish and so on, far more than mere ornament, and  indeed, that ornamentation itself was rather an exuberance of fine  workmanship than a matter of merely abstract lines. Workmanship when  separated by too wide a gulf from fresh thought--that is, from  design--inevitably decays, and, on the other hand, ornamentation,  divorced from workmanship, is necessarily unreal, and quickly falls into  affectation. Proper ornamentation may be defined as a language addressed  to the eye; it is pleasant thought expressed in the speech of the tool.    In the third place, we would have this series put artistic craftsmanship  before people as furnishing reasonable occupations for those who would  gain a livelihood. Although within the bounds of academic art, the  competition, of its kind, is so acute that only a very few per cent. can  fairly hope to succeed as painters and sculptors; yet, as artistic  craftsmen, there is every probability that nearly every one who would  pass through a sufficient period of apprenticeship to workmanship and  design would reach a measure of success.    In the blending of handwork and thought in such arts as we propose to  deal with, happy careers may be found as far removed from the dreary  routine of hack labour, as from the terrible uncertainty of academic  art. It is desirable in every way that men of good education should be  brought back into the productive crafts: there are more than enough of  us \"in the city,\" and it is probable that more consideration will be  given in this century than in the last to Design and Workmanship.           *       *       *       *       *    The designing and making of Costume is a craft--sometimes artistic--with  which we are all more or less concerned. It is also, in its own way, one  of the living arts, that is, it is still carried forward experimentally  by experts directly attached to the \"business.\" It has not yet been  subjected to rules of good taste formulated by Academies and  Universities; but when Inigo Jones, the great architect, was asked to  make some designs for fancy dress, he based them on the Five Orders of  Architecture, and ponderous fancies they were.    If we look for the main stem of principle on which modern Costume  develops, we seem to find it in the desire for freshness, for the clean,  the uncrushed, and the perfectly fitted and draped. Probably a modern  lady's ideal would be to wear a dress once, and then burn it.    A correlative of the ideal of freshness is the delight in perfect \"cut,\"  and the rapidly changing fashions are doubtless conditioned in part by  the desire for the new and unsullied. \"Novelty\" is a guarantee of  newness.    In such ephemeral productions it would be vain to seek for certain fine  types of excellence which were once common when dresses were not so  lightly cast aside. So it is necessary that we should understand what  the ruling principle is, for it is one which will not be set aside at  the bidding of well-meaning reformers. I will only venture to say that  it would be desirable to make the attempt to separate in some degree the  more constant elements of dress from those which are more variable. It  will seem a pity to more than outsiders that a \"well-dressed\" person  need wear so little which deserves to have been made by human hands, and  nothing which deserves to be preserved. Fine laces and jewels are  allowed to be antique--could not the circle of such things be a little  broadened? A properly groomed man carries about on him literally nothing  worth looking at. We might surely look for a watch-chain with some  delicacy of handiwork--something beyond mechanical reductions of iron  cables. Fine buttons might conceivably be made to go with the studs, or  be made of crystal, amethyst, and silver or gold. Women might allow of  the transfer of fine embroidered applications from one dress to another,  or make more use of clasps and the like. I am confident that when it is  pointed out, it will be felt as a shortcoming that no part of a fine  lady's dress need now be too good to throw away. Although the present  volume is cast into the form of a history, it is also intended to be a  book of suggestions; and the hope is held that modern dressmakers may  refer to it as much as, or more than, those who are interested in dress  from the historical point of view.    In any case the author's accurate knowledge of the facts, and his many  bright sketches--which are often drawn from examples in his own  remarkable collection--make the present volume an admirable handbook of  English Costume. The more technical \"patterns\" which are included  amongst the illustrations will be found most valuable to all who wish to  go deeper than the first glance reveals.

WEBB, J. KNOX JONES, JR., AND GEORGE W. BYERS    In 1954, two of us (Jones and Byers) collected reptiles and amphibians  in Korea incidental to field studies relating to hemorrhagic fever. The  382 specimens thus obtained were deposited either in the Museum of  Natural History of The University of Kansas (KU), or in the Museum of  Zoology of the University of Michigan (UMMZ), and are the basis for the  present report. Continuous American military operations of one sort or  another in Korea since 1945 have afforded opportunities for interested  persons to obtain there collections of amphibians and reptiles, the  study of which has resulted in several recent publications (Babb, 1955;  Dixon, 1956; Hahn, 1959 and 1960; Shannon, 1956 and 1957; Stewart, 1953  and 1954; Tanner, 1953; Walley, 1958_a_ and 1958_b_). This paper, which  contains comments on the natural history and taxonomy of 22 species, all  previously reported from Korea, supplements earlier studies, especially  Shannon's (1956) annotated list of the herpetofauna of the country.    Shannon (_loc. cit._) recorded 36 kinds of reptiles and amphibians from  Korea. Subsequently, _Bufo stejnegeri_ (previously omitted) was added by  Shannon (1957), _Takydromus takydromoides oldi_ was described by Walley  (1958_a_), and _Takydromus kwangakuensis_ was relegated to synonymy  under _T. amurensis_ by Walley (1958_b_). Presently, then, 37 kinds are  on record from the Korean Peninsula.    In the accounts beyond, Jones and Byers are mostly responsible for the  remarks on natural history, whereas Webb is mostly responsible for the  taxonomic comments. The synonymies include (1) the original description,  which is followed by (2) the first use of the name-combination here  employed if it differs from the name as originally proposed, and (3) any  synonyms having type localities in Korea. All measurements are in  millimeters and all dates refer to the year 1954 unless otherwise  indicated. A gazetteer of localities mentioned in the text and a list of  literature cited follow the accounts of species.    We are grateful to the officers, enlisted men and civilians associated  in 1954 with the Field Unit of the Commission on Hemorrhagic Fever,  Armed Forces Epidemiological Board, who aided our efforts in Korea; we  are especially mindful of the contributions of Dr. Albert A. Barber, Dr.  Marshall Hertig, Mr. Louis J. Lipovsky and Dr. Warren D. Thomas. We are  grateful also to Mr. Yoshinori Imaizumi, National Science Museum of  Japan, for his translations of several papers in Japanese, and to Dr.  Edward H. Taylor for making certain pertinent references available to  us.      =Hynobius leechii= Boulenger        _Hynobius Leechii_ Boulenger, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 5, 19:67,        January, 1887 (type locality, Gensan [=Wonsan], Korea).        _Hynobius leechii quelpaertensis_ Mori, Jour. Chosen Nat. Hist.        Soc., 6:47 (Japanese) and 53 (English), March 25, 1928 (type        locality, Quelpart Island [=Cheju Do], Korea).        _Specimens examined_ (3).--1 mi. SW Inje, 1 (KU); 4 mi. NNE      Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 2 (KU).        _Description_ (KU 38774 from 1 mi. SW Inje).--Total length, 86 (head      13, body 40, tail 33); costal grooves (including axillary and      inguinal), 13; two costal grooves between adpressed toes; length of      inner branch of series of vomerine teeth less than distance between      outer border of naris and peak of opposite series (tooth-rows      V-shaped, approximately as long as broad); dorsal surface yellowish      brown or buff (yellowish in life), having numerous blackish marks;      venter yellowish cream, having an indistinct grayish mottling.    _Remarks._--The salamander described above was found in a foxhole with  another desiccated individual (not saved) on a military compound on  April 24. The only other occurrence of _H. leechii_ on the mainland to  come to our attention was the report of several larvae that were seen in  a small pool on a hillside near Chip'o-ri in the summer of 1953.    Each of the two specimens from Cheju Do (KU 38775-76) differs from KU  38774 in having (1) the length of inner branch of the vomerine series  slightly greater than the distance between outer border of naris and  peak of opposite series (tooth-rows V-shaped, longer than broad), (2) a  dorsal and ventral keel on the tail, (3) one costal groove (rather than  two costal grooves) between adpressed toes, and (4) in being darker both  dorsally and ventrally. The area of buff on the dorsal surface of each  specimen is reduced by a fine, blackish mottling and stippling, and the  venter of each is grayish. Respective total lengths of KU 38775 and  38776 are 84 (head 12, body 36, tail 36) and 89 (12, 35, 42), and the  number of costal grooves 13 and 14. Although the two specimens are of  approximately the same size, the tail of KU 38776 is noticeably the  longer; the tail of KU 38775 is thicker and deeper than that of KU  38776.    The two specimens from 4 mi. NNE Sogwi-ri were taken on September 9 in  damp substrate under volcanic rocks along a little-used road; although  many rocks were overturned, only these two individuals were found. A  South Korean soldier informed us that salamanders were fairly common on  Cheju Do.    Mori (1928_a_:16) first mentioned in Japanese text the alleged  distinctiveness of the salamander occurring on Cheju Do. Later, Mori  (1928_b_:47 in Japanese, and 1928_c_:53 in English) provided valid  descriptions of the subspecies, _Hynobius leechii quelpaertensis_. Okada  (1934:17) questioned the validity of _H. l. quelpaertensis_ and Sato  (1943) regarded the salamanders of Cheju Do as inseparable from the  Korean _H. leechii_. The English description of _quelpaertensis_ is  briefer than the preceding one in Japanese and lacks comparisons with  related forms. KU 38775-76 seemingly differ appreciably from the  description of _quelpaertensis_ only in having the series of vomerine  teeth narrowly V-shaped and longer than broad. We tentatively follow  Sato in regarding _quelpaertensis_ as a synonym of _leechii_.      =Bombina orientalis= (Boulenger)        _Bombinator orientalis_ Boulenger, Ann. Mag. Nat.

Hist., 61:435,        August 29, 1931).        _Bombina orientalis_, Stejneger, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., 58:51, figs.        30-43, pl. VII (reproduction from Boulenger, _supra_), July 22,        1907.        _Specimens examined_ (87).--2 mi. N Chip'o-ri, 8 (KU), 5 (UMMZ); 1      mi. SW Inje, 1 (KU); 15 mi. NE Mosulp'o, Cheju Do, 6 (KU);      Sangdaehwa, 2 (KU); Taehoesan-ni, 1 (KU); 1 mi. W Tangjonggok, 32      (KU), 17 (UMMZ); Tangnim-ni, 2 (KU); 3 mi. SW Yanggu, 1 (KU); 2 mi.      N Yongdae-ri, 8 (KU), 4 (UMMZ).    _Remarks._--Most of our specimens were taken from breeding congresses  after heavy rains in rice fields and other shallow temporary waters.  Thirteen individuals from Chip'o-ri were collected from foxholes around  the edge of a military compound (two pairs in amplexus; no egg masses  seen), and represent a small sample of frogs that were everywhere  following a heavy rain on the night of May 13-14. On April 23, 32  _Bombina orientalis_ and three _Rana temporaria dybowskii_ were trapped  in the water-filled bottom of an unused grease pit near Tangjonggok.  Many tadpoles and two kinds of egg masses (small clusters and beadlike  strings) were present; the small clusters of _Bombina_ were commonest.  On June 13 at the same locality, thousands of these toads were observed  (hundreds in axillary amplexus) in foxholes, temporary rain pools, and  backwashes"]]]
