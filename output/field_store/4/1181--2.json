The Most Profitable for Squab    Raising.]          INTRODUCTORY PREFACE      No business has had such a wonderful growth within the last few years as  the raising of squabs for market. Only a few years ago the use of squabs  for food was confined to a few of the most wealthy families. Game was  plentiful and cheap and those who were not very well off preferred quail  and other game birds to paying the high prices asked for the few squabs  which were sent to market.    Gradually the demand for squabs grew larger, as more people became  acquainted with their delicacy and good qualities as food, and this led  to larger numbers being produced. Soon all the larger markets furnished  squabs and then the smaller ones began to supply them and now many a  comparatively small market is not complete without squabs as a part of  the supplies of food kept on hand or provided on order.    Game birds have become scarce and high-priced, and squabs have taken  their place in such a manner that the demand for game is not so large as  it was, while the demand for squabs continually increases.    The rearing of squabs for market is immensely profitable as well as  easy. Squab-raising can be conducted on a scale large enough to make it  worth while in the back yard of a town lot, or it can be conducted on a  scale large enough to require several acres with equal profit on every  dollar invested in the business.    Squab-breeding is a business which is profitable when conducted as a  side line on a small space and all the work may be done by women,  children, or those who are not strong enough for the more laborious  occupations of life. At the same time it is a business which men of  affairs need not hesitate to undertake as there are squab farms on which  pigeons are kept by tens of thousands with great profit.    The squab business may be commenced with small capital and rapidly  increased from the increase of the flock, as each pair of breeding birds  will produce at least twelve in a year so the increase is very rapid.    So great has the demand for a book which would give all the details of  the business of squab-raising become, that we have felt compelled to  publish this book. It is written to teach people, beginners mostly, not  merely how to raise squabs, but how to conduct a squab and pigeon  business successfully. We have found breeders of squabs who knew how to  raise them fairly well and took pleasure in doing so, but were weak on  the business end of the industry. The fancier, who raises animals  because he likes their looks or their actions, or because he hopes to  beat some other fancier at an exhibition, is not the man for whom we  have written this book. We have developed utility pigeons and the  squabbing industry solely because they are staples, salable in any  market at a remunerative price. The success of squabs as we handle them  depends on their earning capacity. They are a matter of business. Our  development of squabs is based on the fact that they are good eating,  that people now are in the habit of asking for and eating them, and  there is a large traffic in them which may be pushed to an enormous  extent without weakening either the market or the price. If, as happens  in this case, pigeons are a beautiful pet stock as well as money makers  so much the better. It is just as easy to pet a practical animal as an  impractical animal, and much more satisfying.    This book is the latest and most comprehensive work we have done, giving  the results of our experience as fully and as accurately as we can  present the subject. It is intended as an answer to the hundreds of  letters we receive, and we have tried to cover every point which a  beginner or an expert needs to know. It has been our experience in  handling this subject and bringing it home to people that the little  points are the ones on which they most quickly go astray, and on which  they wish the fullest information. After they have a fair start, they  are able to think out their operations for themselves. Accordingly we  have covered every point in this book in simple language and if the  details in some places appear too commonplace, remember that we have  erred on the side of plainness.    It has surprised a great many people to learn that pigeons are such a  staple and workable article. They have been handled by the old methods  for years without their great utility value being made plain. When we  first learned about squabs, we were struck by the impressive fact that  here was something which grew to market size in the incredibly short  period of four weeks and then was marketed readily at a good profit. The  spread of that knowledge will make money for you. Show your neighbors  the birds; you tell them the facts, and perhaps give them a squab to  eat, then you will find a quick call for all the live breeders you can  supply.    We have tried to answer all the questions which a beginner would ask and  give all the details so plainly that any one can begin breeding pigeons  and raising squabs with success. The instructions given are based on  actual experience in raising squabs and we have tried to write so  plainly that any one can understand just how to begin and continue in  the business.    Those who follow the instructions given may look forward with confidence  to a successful career as pigeon-breeders provided they begin with the  right kind of breeding stock, the kind which produces heavy-weight,  plump, white-fleshed squabs.

[Illustration: A Pair of Beautiful Blue Bar Mammoth Homers, Straight    American Bred.]          CHAPTER I    PROFITS OF SQUAB RAISING--WILL IT PAY?      In first considering squab breeding the beginner always asks, \"Will It  Pay Me to Raise Squabs?\" It is well to consider this phase of any  business before making very much of an investment.    The squab business is comparatively new in this country although it has  already reached such proportions that there can not be any doubt but it  is the most profitable and pleasant business in which any one may  engage. Under the methods outlined in this book there is no chance for a  conscientious worker to fail.    This country is filled with plants large and small and I have yet to  find a plant that is not paying a handsome profit unless there be  something wrong with the stock or methods employed. I have visited the  great squab plants of California where thousands upon thousands of birds  are left to fly at will and nest in open boxes protected only from the  sun, and here I find that the squabs are paying a fine return on the  investment and thousands of tourists visit these large plants annually  and pay an admission fee of fifty cents each so that the revenue from  this source is considerable.    I have visited also the great squab district in South Jersey where the  squabs are produced for the large cities of the East; the plants also in  Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania, and I find that on the best  equipped and best paying plants the methods employed are practically  identical with those outlined in this book. The fact that experienced  breeders in such widely separated sections of the country have adopted  almost identical methods is certainly proof that we have the right idea  and that the advice we give here to the beginner will be well worth  while.    The largest plants in the country are in the far East and far West as  indicated, but I believe there is no one other state that has so many  up-to-date plants as the state of Iowa. You will find a paying squab  farm in nearly every city of this state, and in some of them there are  two or three large and up-to-date, well equipped plants. In one little  town in the northern part of the state there is a plant where over  fifteen thousand breeders are kept right along. The proprietor of this  plant has told me that when he began with a few pairs of Homers of  indiscriminate breeding he had hardly enough funds to pay for the birds  and their feed for the first few months. He now owns the large plant of  several thousand birds of the purest stock with suitable buildings, and  a beautiful home and drives an up-to-date seven-passenger auto-mobile.  His son and daughter are both attending a university in the East and  every cent of his money has been made with pigeons. If his were the only  case of such kind there would still be proof enough of the profits in  the squab business to justify careful consideration by anyone, but I  personally know of thousands of others who have made a success, some of  them on a larger scale, and there can no longer be any doubt of the  opportunity of making money in this business.

NEW-YORK, NOVEMBER 1, 1851. No. IV.          THE GREAT EXHIBITION OF THE NEW-YORK STATE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY AT  ROCHESTER.    [Illustration: EXTERIOR OF THE FAIR.]      This is an age of Exhibitions. From the humble collection of cattle and  counter-panes, swine and \"garden sauce,\" at the central village of some  secluded County, up to the stupendous \"World's Fair\" at London, wherein all  nations and all arts are represented, \"Industrial Expositions,\" as the  French more accurately term them, are the order of the day. And this is  well--nay, it is inspiring. It proves the growth and diffusion of a wider  and deeper consciousness of the importance and dignity of Labor as an  element of national strength and social progress. That corn and cloth are  essential to the comfortable subsistence of the human family, and of every  portion of it, was always plain enough; but the truth is much broader than  that. Not food alone, but knowledge, virtue, power, depend upon the subtle  skill of the artificer's fingers, the sturdy might of the husbandman's arm.  Let these fail, through the blighting influence of despotism,  licentiousness, superstition, or slavery, and the national greatness is  cankered at the root, and its preservation overtasks the ability of  Phocion, of Hannibal, of Cato. A nation flourishes or withers with the  development and vigor of its Industry. It may prosper and be strong without  statesmen, warriors, or jurists; it fades and falls with the decline of its  arts and its agriculture. Wisely, therefore, do rulers, nobles, field  marshals and archbishops, unite in rendering the highest honors to eminence  in the domain of Industry, dimly perceiving that it is mightier and more  enduring than their petty and fragile potencies. The empire of Napoleon,  though so lately at its zenith, has utterly passed away, while that of  Fulton is still in its youth.    A State Agricultural Society, numbering among its members some thousands of  her foremost citizens, mainly but not wholly farmers, is one of the most  commendable institutions of this great and growing commonwealth. Aided  liberally by the State government, it holds an Annual Fair at some one of  the chief towns of the interior, generally on the line of the Erie Canal,  whereby the collection of stock and other articles for exhibition is  facilitated, and the cost thereof materially lessened. Poughkeepsie,  Albany, Saratoga Springs, Utica, Syracuse (twice), Auburn, Rochester  (twice), and Buffalo, are the points at which these Fairs have been held  within the last ten years. Recently, the railroads have transported cattle,  &c., for exhibition, either at half-price, or entirely without charge,  while the State's bounty and the liberal receipts for admission to the  grounds have enabled the managers to stimulate competition by a very  extensive award of premiums, so that almost every recurrence of the State  Fair witnesses a larger and still more extensive display of choice animals.  Whether the improvement in quality keeps pace with the increase in number  is a point to be maturely considered.    The Fair of this year was held at ROCHESTER, in a large open field about a  mile south of the city, and of course near the Genesee river. Gigantic  stumps scattered through it, attested how recently this whole region was  covered with the primeval forest. Probably fifty thousand persons now live  within sight of the Rochester steeples, though not a human being inhabited  this then dense and swampy wilderness forty years ago. And here, almost  wholly from a region which had less than five thousand white inhabitants in  1810, not fewer than one hundred thousand persons, two-thirds of them adult  males, were drawn together expressly to witness this exhibition. The number  who entered the gates on Thursday alone exceeded seventy-five thousand,  while the attendance on the two preceding days and on Friday, of persons  who were not present on Thursday, must have exceeded twenty-five thousand.  Of course, many came with no definite purpose, no previous preparation to  observe and learn, and so carried home nothing more than they brought  there, save the head-ache, generated by their irregularities and excesses  while absent; but thousands came qualified and resolved to profit by the  practical lessons spread before them, and doubtless went away richly  recompensed for the time and money expended in visiting the Fair. This  Annual Exhibition is as yet the Farmers' University; they will in time have  a better, but until then they do well to make the most of that which  already welcomes them to its cheap, ready and practical inculcations.    [Illustration: ROCHESTER.]    The President of the State Society for this year is Mr. JOHN DELAFIELD,  long a master spirit among our Wall-street financiers, and for some years  President of the Phenix bank. He was finally swamped by the rascality of  the State of Illinois in virtually repudiating her public debt, whereby Mr.  Delafield, who had long acted as her financial agent in New-York, and had  staked his fortune on her integrity, was reduced from affluence to need.  Nothing daunted by this reverse, he promptly transferred his energies from  finance to agriculture, taking hold of a large farm in Seneca County, near  the beautiful village of Geneva; and on this farm he soon proved himself  one of the best practical agriculturists in our State. Before he had been  five years on the soil, he was already teaching hundreds of life-long  cultivators, by the quiet force of his successful example, how to double  the product of their lands and more than double their annual profits. His  enlightened and admirable husbandry has finally called him to the post he  now occupies--one not inferior in true dignity and opportunity for  usefulness to that of Governor of the State. And this is a fair specimen of  the elasticity of the American character and its capacity for adapting  itself to any and every change of circumstances.    [Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE FAIR.]    The Annual Address at this Fair was delivered by the Hon. STEPHEN A.  DOUGLAS, now U. S. Senator from Illinois, and a very probable \"Democratic\"  candidate for next President of the United States. It was an able and well  enunciated discourse, devoted mainly to political economy as affecting  agriculture, taking the \"free trade\" view of this important and difficult  subject, and evidently addressed quite as much to southern politicians as  to New-York farmers; but it embodied many practical suggestions of decided  force and value. This address has already received a very wide circulation.    A public entertainment was proffered on Thursday evening to the officers of  the State Society, on behalf of the city of Rochester, which was attended  by ex-President TYLER, GOV. WASHINGTON HUNT, ex-Governor and ex-Secretary  MARCY, GEN. WOOL, Governor WRIGHT of Indiana, &c. &c. Senator DOUGLAS  arrived in the train just before the gathering broke up. The presence of  ladies, and the absence of liquors, were the most commendable features of  this festivity, which was convened at an absurdly late hour, and  characterized by an afflictive amount of dull speaking. Such an  entertainment is very well on an occasion like this, merely as a means of  enabling the congregated thousands to see and hear the celebrities convened  with them; but it should be given in the afternoon or beginning of the  evening, should cost very little (the speaking being dog-cheap and the  eatables no object), and should in nearly all respects be just what the  Rochester festival was not. As an exercise in false hospitality, however,  and a beacon for future adventurers in the same line, this entertainment  had considerable merit.    [Illustration: AZALIA.    _The best Short-Horned Durham Cow over Three Years Old: Owned by Lewis G.  Morris._]    [Illustration: LORD ERYHOLM.    _The best Two Year Old Short-Horned Durham Bull: Owned by Lewis G.  Morris._]    NEAT CATTLE stood first in intrinsic value among the classes of articles  exhibited at the Fair. Probably not less than One Thousand of these were  shown on this occasion, including imported bulls and cows, working-oxen,  fat steers, blood-heifers, calves, &c. &c. Of these we could not now say  whether the Durham or Devonshire breed predominated, but the former had  certainly no such marked ascendency as at former Fairs. Our impression from  the statements of disinterested breeders was and is, that where cattle are  bred mainly for the market, a larger weight of flesh may be obtained at an  early age from the Durham than from any rival breed, though not of the  finest quality; while for milk or butter the Devon is, and perhaps one or  two other breeds are, preferable. But this is merely the inference of one,  who has no experience in the premises, from a comparison of the statements  of intelligent breeders of widely differing preferences. Probably each of  the half-dozen best breeds is better adapted to certain localities and  purposes than any other; and intelligent farmers assert, that we still need  some breeds not yet introduced in this country, especially the small Black  Cattle of the Scottish Highlands, which, from their hardiness, excellence  of flesh, small cost for wintering, &c., are specially adapted to our own  rugged upland districts, particularly that which half covers the  north-eastern quarter of our State. The subject is one of the deepest  interest to agriculturists, and is destined to receive a thorough  investigation at their hands.
