BY GEORGE WARING.        LONDON:  HARVEY AND DARTON, GRACECHURCH STREET.          THE SQUIRRELS AND OTHER ANIMALS.          CHAPTER I.      \"Bless me, I do believe I have been asleep!\" said a squirrel, one fine  morning in early spring, when the delicious warmth of the sun had  reached him in his winter retreat, and roused the lazy little fellow  from a two months' nap. The truth is, that he and his family had fallen  asleep at the first setting in of the cold weather, and had passed the  dismal winter in a state of profound repose, except, that, during a  warm day or two in January, they had roused themselves for a short  time, and eaten a few nuts and acorns from their winter store.    \"Yes, I have certainly been asleep,\" said the squirrel, \"and I fancy I  have had a pretty long nap too. Well, I declare, my lazy wife and  children are lying there still, curled up like so many dead things!  Hallo, Mrs. Brush! come, get up and eat some breakfast. Here is the sun  shining in most gloriously at the mouth of the hole, and I hear the  blackbird's merry whistle in the grove below. Ah! they wont move, so  I'll have a run this fine morning, and see how the world looks now.  Perhaps when I come back they may be awake.\"    So Master Brush went to the entrance of his nest, which was situated at  a great height from the ground, in a commodious hollow of a magnificent  oak-tree.    \"Oh joy!\" he exclaimed, when he had looked around him for half a  minute, \"I see those delicious buds are beginning to sprout. Nobody can  tell how I long for some fresh green food again! Nuts and acorns are  all very well, but then they are _terribly dry_. Here goes for a leap,  then!\"    [Illustration: THE SQUIRREL. Page 4.]    So saying, the active little fellow sprang from his hole, and if you  had seen him, you would have thought that no animal without wings could  have ventured upon such a leap without being dashed to pieces upon the  ground. But Brush had nothing to fear; for though he had no wings, he  knew that his beautiful bushy tail, and his legs, stretched out  straight from his body, would bear him up in the air, and prevent his  falling too heavily. Then he had very strong legs for his size,  especially his hind legs, and his claws were so sharp and hooked, that  he could skip along the boughs, without the least danger of falling  off, and he could even run up and down the perpendicular trunks of  trees, almost as easily as we can walk upon the level ground.    So when Brush leaped from the entrance of his hole, instead of falling  to the earth, he pitched lightly upon a bough of the tree a long way  below him, and ran along it for a short distance. Then he leaped to  another bough still lower, from the end of which, he very easily  reached the next tree, and so on, from tree to tree, till he found  himself in a well-known grove of young larches, at some distance. Here  he immediately fell to work, nibbling the fresh green buds and tender  bark. He sat upright, as squirrels generally do when they are eating,  using his fore-feet as hands to hold his food, and very pretty he  looked. But I think, that, if the gamekeeper had seen him injuring the  young trees,[1] he would not have been very well pleased, and perhaps  he would have put his gun to his shoulder and shot poor little Brush,  if he had not received orders to the contrary. For though his master  knew that the squirrels injured his young trees sometimes, he would not  allow them to be killed.          [1] I should be sorry to bring a false accusation against the        squirrels, the most beautiful and entertaining of all the British        quadrupeds. But the whole truth must be told. They _do_        occasionally injure young trees by feeding on the buds and bark;        and a relation of mine, who has an estate in the West of England,        informs me that his plantations have suffered considerably from        their attacks. In his woods, squirrels are unusually abundant,        and in consequence their depredations are the more evident. But,        generally speaking, these animals are not sufficiently numerous        to cause any serious injury to our plantations, and the pleasure        they afford us by exhibiting their wonderful leaps and feats of        agility among the summer branches, more than repay us for their        very trifling thefts.    This gentleman had a particular reason for protecting the squirrels in  his woods. One day the gamekeeper shot a very fine one, and brought it  up to the house as a present for his master's little daughter Jane, who  was confined with a disease from which she never recovered. At first,  the child was pleased with her new plaything, but her tender heart was  pained when she saw its beautiful eyes becoming dim, and recollected  that, perhaps it had left in its nest some young ones, that were  perishing for want of its care. Her grief was increased by fancying  that, as the animal had been killed on purpose for her, she had been  the cause of its death, and though her parents said all they could to  comfort her, they could hardly make her believe that she was not to  blame; for when people are very ill they often have strange fancies.    Poor little Jane died a few days after, and almost the last words she  spoke were, \"Papa, don't let Harvey kill any more squirrels.\" Her  father carefully attended to this request of his darling little  girl--his only child--the joy of his heart--and though, like most  country gentlemen, he was exceedingly angry if any person stole his  game, I believe he would rather have lost fifty pheasants or hares than  one squirrel. _And so would I_, had I been poor little Jane's papa!    But we must not forget Master Brush, who has been seated all this time  in the larch-plantation, making a famous meal upon the aromatic buds  and tender bark. \"Ah!\" said he to himself, \"if those lazy creatures in  the nest yonder did but know what delicious food there is here!\" Then  he continued munching and skipping about the trees for some time  longer. But presently the weather began to change. The sun hid his  glorious face behind dark clouds; a fierce easterly wind whistled  through the trees; a cold driving rain came on, and winter seemed to be  returned again.    \"Oh, dear me,\" said Brush, \"this will never do! I don't like this sort  of thing at all! the nest is the best place I declare.\"    When he reached his own tree, he was obliged to ascend to his nest by a  different way, for squirrels cannot leap up to any place that is very  far above them; so he ran along the ground for a little distance, to  the bottom of the oak, which was surrounded by a very close thicket of  brambles.    In this thicket lived several families of dormice, who were Brush's  relations, and the waggish squirrel called out to one of them as he  passed, \"Hallo, cousin Gotobed! The summer is almost over. If you don't  make haste, all the nuts and acorns will be gone!\" But there was no  possibility of making his cousin Gotobed hear; for you must know, that  a dormouse is a very sleepy little fellow indeed; even more so than a  squirrel.    Brush was soon in his own warm nest, where he found all his family  safe, and sound asleep, as he had left them. This nest, as I have  mentioned, was made in a hole in the upper part of a very large  oak-tree, and was almost as dry and warm as any bedroom in our houses.  It was lined with dry leaves and soft moss, and in another part of the  hole, which was large enough for five or six squirrels' nests, there  was a great heap of nuts, acorns, and beechmast, which the careful  Brush and his family had collected in the autumn.    Besides this stock of food, there were two more hoards, hidden in holes  in different parts of the tree for the cunning squirrels thought, that,  if some thief should wish to rob them of their treasures, he would not  be very likely to discover all three of their storehouses.    If it were not for this large stock of provisions, the poor squirrels  would be starved to death, in very mild winters, because then they do  not sleep so much, and fresh food cannot be procured.    When Brush was in his comfortable nest, safe from the cold wind and  rain, though he had almost filled his stomach with young buds, he  thought he would try one of his nuts, just to see how they had kept  through the winter. Holding the nut in his hands, his sharp teeth soon  gnawed through the shell, and when he had reached the kernel, the  dainty little fellow would not eat a bit till he had carefully removed  every particle of the dry brown skin from it.    \"A very sweet nut, I declare,\" said he, \"nuts are not to be despised, after  all. Dear me, I think I feel rather sleepy again! Nuts are not bad things,  but as I was saying before, rather dry, when one has nothing else. But  really I am very sleepy. 'Tis either the cold wind, or the famous  breakfast I have made, I suppose;--very sleepy--indeed,--upon--my--word.\"    The last words sounded exactly as your voice would, if your head was  covered up under the bed-clothes. The truth is, that, while Brush was  talking to himself, he had gradually changed his position from sitting  upright to lying down on his side. Then he slowly rolled himself up  into a round ball, with his head and back closely covered by his  beautiful tail. This served him famously for a blanket, and so we may  say, that his last words were really spoken _with his head under the  bed-clothes_.    By way of filling up the time till the fine weather returns, and our  sleeping friend uncurls himself again, I will give you a very short  description"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33502"],[0,"My Knitting Book (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This book was  produced from scanned images of public domain material  from the Google Print project.)

Richards,         100, St. Martin's Lane.          PREFACE.      The examples of knitting, contained in the following pages, have been  selected with the greatest care,--many are original,--and the whole are  so arranged as to render them comprehensible even to a novice in the  art.    Knitting being so often sought, as an evening amusement, both by the  aged and by invalids, a large and distinct type has been adopted,--as  affording an additional facility. The writer feels confident in the  recommendation of \"MY KNITTING BOOK,\" and humbly hopes it may meet with  the same liberal reception that has been accorded to her \"HAND-BOOK OF  NEEDLEWORK.\"    The numerous piracies that have been committed on her last mentioned  work, have been one inducement to publish this little volume; and from  the low price at which it is fixed, nothing, but a very extended  circulation, can ensure her from loss. Some few of the examples have  been selected from the chapter on knitting, in the \"HAND-BOOK.\"        _3, New Burlington Street_,          _November 1843._          CONTENTS.
