Haensel and Gretel is an opera in three acts, the music by Engelbert  Humperdinck and the libretto by Adelheid Wette. It is the German version  of the old nursery legend--Babes in the Wood.    The first scene discloses a wretched homestead. The two children, Haensel  and Gretel, are at work--the boy making brooms and the girl knitting  stockings. They both complain of feeling very hungry, and there isn't  a thing in the house. Yes, there's a jug of milk that will make nice  blanc-mange when mother comes home. Haensel tastes it and Gretel raps his  fingers. He says he won't work any more and proposes they dance instead.  Gretel is delighted. He is very awkward at first but she teaches him the  steps and they are getting along so famously that they whirl around the  room and fall exhausted on the floor. At this moment the mother enters  and she is so angry at seeing them do no work that she boxes their ears  for it. In her excitement she gives the milk pitcher a push. It falls  off the table, breaks in pieces, and spills all the milk. At this she  is beside herself and seizes a basket and tells the children to go to  the wood and pick strawberries. They must not come home till the basket  is full. They run off while she, weary of life, sits sobbing herself to  sleep.    The father is heard in the distance with a joyous song and enters in  a joyful mood. He wakes up his unhappy wife to tell that he has sold  all his brooms at the fair for splendid prices and he shows his basket  full of provisions. Both are thus in fine humor when he asks where the  children are. She says she sent them away in disgrace to the Ilsenstein.  The Ilsenstein! he exclaims, where the witches ride on broomsticks and  devour little children. Exclaiming \"Oh horror!\" she runs out of the  house, he after her, to find Haensel and Gretel.    The second act shows a forest. Gretel is making a garland of wild roses  while Haensel is looking for strawberries. In the background is the  Ilsenstein. It is sunset. Haensel crowns Gretel queen of the wood and  she allows him to taste a strawberry. He gives her one in return and  little by little they devour them all. Then they are frightened. They  want to pick more but it is getting too dark. They want to leave but  cannot find the way. Gretel fears being in the dark but Haensel is very  brave. She sees faces in trees and stumps and he calls out to reassure  her. Echo answers and he grows frightened too. They huddle together as a  thick mist arises which hides the background. Gretel, terror-stricken,  falls on her knees and hides behind Haensel. At this moment a little man  appears, as the mist rises, and quiets them. It is the Sandman and he  sings them to slumber. Half awake they say their evening prayer and sink  down on the moss in each other's arms. A dazzling light then appears,  the mist rolls itself into a staircase and angels pass down and group  themselves about the two sleeping children.    In the third act the scene is the same, the mist still hiding the  background. The Dawn Fairy shakes dewdrops on the children. They wake,  but Haensel very lazily. They both have had dreams of angels coming  to see them with shining wings. The mist now clears away and in the  background is seen the witches' house with a fence of gingerbread  figures. There are also seen an oven and a cage. Haensel wants to go  inside and Gretel draws him back. But Haensel says the angels beguiled  their footsteps and why shouldn't they nibble a bit at the cottage?  They tiptoe to the fence and break off a bit of the cake cautiously.  The witch voice from within tells them to go on nibbling. They like the  gingerbread. It suits them famously and apparently suits her too as she  watches them from her window.    But she comes out of the house as they are joyously laughing and throws  a rope about Haensel's neck and caresses them. Haensel tries to get  away and calls her names, while she goes on saying how she loves them  both--they are such dainty morsels. Haensel tries to run away and takes  Gretel with him. But the witch casts a spell on them and they stand  stock-still. Then she leads Haensel to the cage and shuts him in and  gives him almonds and raisins to fatten him up. She loosens Gretel with  the magic stick and says how nice and plump she'll be when she's roasted  brown. She opens the oven and puts more fagots under it and says the  fire will soon be ripe to push Gretel in. In her joy she rides wildly  round on a broomstick while Gretel watches from the house.    The witch calls Gretel out and opens the oven door. Haensel tells Gretel  to beware and the witch tells her to peep in the oven. Gretel pretends  she does not understand. She secretly disenchants Haensel so that when  the witch bends over and peeps into the oven they give her a push and in  she goes. Then they dance wildly about. Haensel throws sweetmeats out of  the window. The oven cracks open and falls into bits, while groups of  children suddenly surround Haensel and Gretel. Then they disenchant the  gingerbread children who are very grateful. As they are all dragging the  gingerbread witch about, the Father and Mother come in and are overjoyed  at finding their children again.          DRAMATIS PERSONAE.          PETER, Broom-maker.

TO THE RIGHT HON.  THE EARL OF RIPON,  VISCOUNT GODERICH,  Lord Privy Seal  &c. &c. &c.        MY LORD,    The completion of this Work affords me the opportunity I have long desired  of thanking your Lordship thus publicly, for the kindness with which you  acceded to my request to be permitted to dedicate it to you.    The encouragement your Lordship was pleased to give me has served to  stimulate me in the prosecution of a task, which would, I fear, have been  too great for me to have accomplished in my present condition, under any  ordinary views of ambition. Indeed, labouring as I have been for many  months past, under an almost total deprivation of sight, (the effect of  exposure and anxiety of mind in the prosecution of geographical  researches,) I owe it to the casual assistance of some of my friends, that  I am at length enabled to lay these results before your Lordship and the  public.    While I feel a painful conviction that many errors must necessarily  pervade a work produced under such unfavourable circumstances, it affords  me no small consolation to reflect that Your Lordship has been aware of my  situation, and will be disposed to grant me every reasonable indulgence.    I have the honor to be,  With the highest respect,  My Lord,  Your Lordship's  Very obedient and humble servant,    CHARLES STURT  London, June, 1833.

PURPOSE OF THIS PRELIMINARY CHAPTER.      When I first determined on committing to the press a detailed account of  the two expeditions, which I conducted into the interior of the Australian  continent, pursuant to the orders of Lieutenant General Darling, the late  Governor of the Colony of New South Wales, it was simply with a view of  laying their results before the geographical world, and of correcting the  opinions that prevailed with regard to the unexplored country to the  westward of the Blue Mountains. I did not feel myself equal either to the  task or the responsibility of venturing any remarks on the Colony of New  South Wales itself. I had had little time for inquiry, amidst the various  duties that fell to my lot in the ordinary routine of the service to which  I belonged, when unemployed by the Colonial Government in the prosecution  of inland discoveries. My observations had been in a great measure  confined to those points which curiosity, or a desire of personal  information, had prompted me to investigate. I did not, therefore, venture  to flatter myself that I had collected materials of sufficient importance  on general topics to enable me to write for the information of others.  Since my return to England, however, I have been strenuously urged to give  a short description of the colony before entering upon my personal  narrative; and I have conversed with so many individuals whose ideas of  Australia are totally at variance with its actual state, that I am  encouraged to indulge the hope that my observations, desultory as they  are, may be of some interest to the public.
