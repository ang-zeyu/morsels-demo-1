In the  following pages I have set down nothing but what has come within his own  personal experience; and, although the little book is full of strange  inconsistencies, I cannot, knowing the man, call them by a harder name.  Nature made old \"Phil\" a Poacher, but she made him a Sportsman and a  Naturalist at the same time. I never met any man who was in closer  sympathy with the wild creatures about him; and never dog or child came  within his influence but what was permanently attracted by his  personality. Although eighty years of age there is still some of the old  erectness in his carriage; some of the old fire in his eyes. As a young  man he was handsome, though now his features are battered out of all  original conception. His silvery hair still covers a lion-like head, and  his tanned cheeks are hard and firm. If his life has been a lawless one  he has paid heavily for his wrong doings. Great as a poacher, he must  have been great whatever he had been. In my boyhood he was the hero whom  I worshipped, and I hardly know that I have gone back on my loyalty.          CONTENTS.    [Illustration]        CHAPTER.                         PAGE.      1.

THE EMBRYO POACHER.      I do not remember the time when I was not a poacher; and if I may say  so, I believe our family has always had a genius for woodcraft.    I was bred on the outskirts of a sleepy town in a good game country, and  my depredations were mostly when the Game Laws were less rigorously  enforced than now. Our home was roughly adorned in fur and feather, and  a number of gaunt lurchers always constituted part of the family. An  almost passionate love of nature, summers of birds' nesting, and a life  spent almost wholly out of doors constituted an admirable training for  an embryo poacher. If it is true that poets are born, not made, it is  equally so of poachers. The successful \"moucher\" must be an inborn  naturalist--must have much in common with the creatures of the fields  and woods around him.    [Illustration]    There is a miniature bird and animal fauna which constitutes as  important game to the young poacher as any he is likely to come across  in after life. There are mice, shrews, voles, for all of which he sets  some primitive snare and captures. The silky-coated moles in their runs  offer more serious work, and being most successfully practised at night,  offers an additional charm. Then there are the red-furred squirrels  which hide among the delicate leaves of the beeches and run up their  grey boles--fairy things that offer an endless subject of delight to any  young savage, and their capturing draws largely upon his inventive  genius. A happy hunting ground is furnished by farmers who require a lad  to keep the birds from their young wheat or corn, as when their services  are required the country is all like a garden. At this time the birds  seem creatures born of the sun, and not only are they seen in their  brightest plumage, but when indulging in all their love frolics. By  being employed by the farmers the erstwhile poacher is brought right  into the heart of the land, and the knowledge of woodcraft and rural  life he there acquires is never forgotten. As likely as not a ditch runs  by the side of the wheat fields, and here the water-hen leads out her  brood. To the same spot the birds come at noon to indulge their mid-day  _siesta_, and in the deep hole at the end of the cut a shoal of silvery  roach fall and rise towards the warm sunlight. Or a brook, which is a  tiny trout stream, babbles on through the meadows and pastures, and has  its attractions too. A stream is always the chief artery of the land,  as in it are found the life-giving elements. All the birds, all the  plants, flock to its banks, and its wooded sides are hushed by the  subdued hum of insects. There are tall green brackens--brackens  unfurling their fronds to the light, and full of the atoms of beautiful  summer. At the bend of the stream is a lime, and you may almost see its  glutinous leaves unfolding to the light. Its winged flowers are infested  with bees. It has a dead bough almost at the bottom of its bole, and  upon it there sits a grey-brown bird. Ever and anon it darts for a  moment, hovers over the stream, and then returns to its perch. A hundred  times it flutters, secures its insect prey, and takes up its old  position on the stump. Bronze fly, bluebottle, and droning bee are  secured alike, for all serve as food to the loveable pied fly-catcher.    [Illustration]    It is the time of the bloom of the first June rose; and here, by the  margin of the wood, all the ground by fast falling blossom is littered.  Every blade teems with life, and the air is instinct with the very  breath of being. Birds' sounds are coming from over and under--from  bough and brake, and a harmonious discord is flooded from the  neighbouring copse. The oak above my head is a murmurous haunt of summer  wings, and wood pigeons coo from the beeches. The air is still, and  summer is on my cheek; arum, wood-sorrel, and celandine mingle at my  feet. The starlings are half buried in the fresh green grass, their  metallic plumage flashing in the sun. Cattle are lazily lying dotted  over the meadows, and the stream is done in a setting of green and gold.  Swallows, skimming the pools, dip in the cool water, and are  gone--leaving a sweet commotion in ever widening circles long after they  have flown. A mouse-like creeper alights at the foot of a thorn, and  runs nimbly up the bark; midway it enters a hole in which is its nest.  A garrulous blue-winged jay chatters from the tall oak, and purple rooks  are picking among the corn. Butterflies dally through the warm air, and  insects swarm among the leaves and flowers of the hedge bottoms. A crake  calls, now here, now far out yonder. Bluebells carpet the wood-margin,  and the bog is bright with marsh plants.    This, then, is the workshop of the young poacher, and here he receives  his first impressions. Is it strange that a mighty yearning springs up  within him to know more of nature's secrets? He finds himself in a fairy  place, and all unconsciously drinks in its sweets. See him now deeply  buried in a golden flood of marsh marigolds! See how he stands  spellbound before saxifrages which cling to a dripping rock. Water  avens, wild parsley, and campions crowd around him, and flags of the  yellow and purple iris tower over all. He watches the doings of the  reed-sparrows deep down in the flags, and sees a water-ouzel as it  rummages among the pebbles at the bottom of the brook. The larvae of  caddis flies, which cover the edge of the stream, are a curious mystery  to him, and he sees the kingfisher dart away as a bit of green light.  Small silvery trout, which rise in the pool, tempt him to try for them  with a crooked pin, and even now with success. He hears the cuckoos  crying and calling as they fly from tree to tree, and quite unexpectedly  finds the nest of a yellow-hammer, between a willow and the bank,  containing its curiously speckled eggs.    Still the life, and the \"hush,\" and the breath go on. Everything  breathes, and moves, and has its being; the things of the day are the  essence thereof. On the margin of the wood are a few young pines, their  delicate plumes just touched with the loveliest green. An odour of  resinous gum is wafted from them, and upon one of the slender sprays a  pair of diminutive goldcrests have hung their procreant cradle. These  things are enough to win any young Bohemian to their ways, and although  as yet they only comprise \"the country,\" soon their wondrous detail  lures their lover on, and he seeks to satisfy the thirst within him by  night as well as by day.    Endless acquaintances are to be made in the fields, and those of the  most pleasurable description. Nests containing young squirrels can be  found in the larch tree tops, and any domestic tabby will suckle these  delightful playthings. Young cushats and cushats' eggs can be obtained  from their wicker-like nests, and sold in the villages. A prickly pet  may be captured in a hedgehog trotting off through the long grass, and  colonies of young wild rabbits may be dug from the mounds and braes. The  skin of every velvety mole is one patch nearer the accomplishment of a  warm, furry vest for winter, and this, if the pests of which it is  comprised are the owner's taking, is worn with pardonable pride. A  moleskin vest constitutes a graduation in woodcraft so to speak.  Sometimes a brace of leverets are found in a tussocky grass clump, but  these are more often allowed to remain than taken.

The essays herein contained have been written at \"odd moments,\" and  for divers purposes. Their chief value lies in the fact that they  illustrate, several of them by means of individual experiences, certain  typical and well-defined periods in the history of the Niagara region.  By \"Niagara region,\" a phrase which no doubt occurs pretty often in the  following pages, I mean to designate in a historic, not a scenic, sense  the frontier territory of the Niagara from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. It  is a region which has a concrete but as yet for the most part unwritten  history of its own. The value of its past to the student, as is ever the  case with \"local history\" in its worthy aspect, depends upon the  importance of its relation to the general history of our country. That  the Niagara region has played an important part in that history, is an  assurance wholly superfluous for even the most casual student of  American development. All that the following studies undertake is to  give a glimpse, with such fidelity as may be, of events and conditions  hereabouts existing, at periods which may fairly be termed typical.    \"The Cross Bearers,\" a paper originally prepared as a lecture for a  class that was studying the history of the Catholic Church in America,  is, so far as I am aware, the first attempt to review in a single  narrative all of the French missions in this immediate vicinity, and the  work of the English-speaking missionary priests who said mass in the  Niagara region prior to its full organization under ecclesiastical  jurisdiction. The data are drawn from the original sources--the Jesuit  Relations, Champlain, Le Clercq, Hennepin, Charlevoix, Crespel and other  early writers whose works, in any edition, are often inaccessible to the  student. For data relating to Bishop Burke, and for other valuable  assistance, I am indebted to my friend the Very Rev. Wm. R. Harris, Dean  of St. Catharines.    \"The Paschal of the Great Pinch\" is an attempt to picture, in narrative  form, conditions conceived to exist at Fort Niagara in 1687-'8, when the  Marquis de Denonville made his abortive attempt to occupy that point.  Lest any reader shall be in doubt as to the genuineness of the memoirs  of the Chevalier De Tregay, I beg to assure him that Lieut. De Tregay is  no myth. His name, and practically all the facts on which my sketch is  based, will be found in the Paris Documents (IV.), \"Documentary History  of the State of New York,\" Vol. I. This paper stands for the French  period on the Niagara; the two next following, for the British period.    \"With Bolton at Fort Niagara\" is almost wholly drawn from unpublished  records, chiefly the Haldimand Papers, the originals of which are in the  British Museum, but certified copies of which are readily accessible to  the student in the Archives at Ottawa. I have made but a slight study of  the great mass of material from which practically the history of the  Niagara region during the Revolution is to be written; yet it is  probable that this slight study makes known for the first time, to  students of our home history, such facts as the employment of Hessians  on the Niagara during the Revolution, the first bringing hither of the  American flag, possibly even the work and fate of Lieut. Col. Bolton  himself.    The next paper, \"What Befel David Ogden,\" is drawn from a widely  different, though scarcely less known source. The personal narrative is  based on an obscure pamphlet by Josiah Priest, published at  Lansingburgh, N. Y., in 1840. I am aware that Priest is not altogether  trustworthy as a historian. Dr. Thos. W. Field calls him a \"prolific,  needy and unscrupulous author\" [_See_ \"An Essay Toward an Indian  Bibliography\"]; yet he concedes to his works \"a large amount of historic  material obtained at some pains from sources more or less authentic.\" My  judgment is, that Priest is least trustworthy in his more ambitious  work; whereas his unpretentious pamphlets, wretchedly printed at a  country press sixty years ago, contain true narratives of individual  undertakings in the Revolution, Indian captivities and other pioneer  experiences, gathered by the writer direct from the hero whose  adventures he wrote down, without literary skill it is true, but also  without apparent perversion or exaggeration. The very circumstantiality  with which David Ogden's experiences are narrated is evidence of their  genuineness. Corroborative evidence is also furnished by the  lately-published muster-rolls of New York regiments during the  Revolution. In the Third Regiment of Tryon County militia, among the  enlisted men, appears the name of David Ogden [\"New York in the  Revolution,\" 2d ed., p. 181], and there was but one David Ogden, not  merely in the Tryon County militia, but so far as these records show, in  the entire soldiery of New York State. In the same regiment there was  also a \"Daniel\" Ogden, Sr., possibly David's father. The name Daniel  Ogden also occurs in the list of Tryon County Rangers [\"New York in the  Revolution,\" 2d ed., p. 186], a service in which we would naturally  expect to find one whom the Indian Brant called \"the beaver hunter, that  old scouter.\" In short, I think we may accept David as altogether  genuine, and in his adventures--never told before, I believe, as a part  of Niagara history--may find an example of patriotic suffering and  endurance wholly typical of what many another underwent at that time and  in this region.    The \"Fort Niagara Centennial Address\" is here included because its most  important part relates to that period in our history immediately  following the Revolution, the \"hold-over period,\" during which, for  thirteen years after the Treaty of 1783, the British continued to occupy  Fort Niagara and other lake posts. What I say on the negotiations  leading to the final relinquishment of Fort Niagara is based on  information gleaned from the manuscript records in London and Ottawa.    \"The Journals and Journeys of an Early Buffalo Merchant\" is also a  contribution to local annals from an unpublished source, being drawn  from the MS. journals of John Lay, very kindly placed in my hands by  members of his family. They afford a picture of conditions hereabouts  and elsewhere, during the years 1810-'23, which I have thought worthy of  preservation.    In the \"Misadventures of Robert Marsh\" I have endeavored by means of a  personal narrative to illustrate another period in our history. The  misguided Marsh fairly stands for many of the so-called Patriots whose  uprising on this border is known as Mackenzie's Rebellion of 1837-'8.  The considerable literature on this subject includes a number of  personal narratives, for the most part published in small editions and  now hard to find; but the scarcest of all, so far as my experience has  discovered, is that from which I have drawn the story of Robert Marsh:  \"Seven Years of My Life, or Narrative of a Patriot Exile, who together  with eighty-two American Citizens were illegally tried for rebellion in  Upper Canada and transported to Van Dieman's Land,\" etc., etc. It is an  exceedingly prolix and pretentious title, after the fashion of the time,  prefacing a badly-written, poorly-printed volume of 207 pages, turned  out by the press of Faxon & Stevens, Buffalo, 1848. In view of the fact  that neither in Sabin nor any other bibliography have I found any  mention of this book, and the further fact that in fifteen years of  somewhat diligent book-hunting I have discovered but one copy, it is no  exaggeration to call Marsh's \"Narrative\" \"scarce,\" if not \"rare.\"    The incidents related in \"Underground Trails\" are illustrative of many  an episode at the eastern end of Lake Erie in the days preceding the  Civil War. I had the facts of the principal adventures some years ago  from the late Mr. Frank Henry of Erie, Pa., who had himself been a  participant in more than one worthy enterprise of the Underground  Railroad. Sketches based on information supplied by Mr. Henry, and  originally written out for the Erie Gazette, are the latter part of the  paper as it now stands.    The last essay, \"Niagara and the Poets,\" is a following of \"Old Trails\"  chiefly in a literary sense, but it is thought its inclusion here"]]]
