S. A.          PREFACE      Of all lines of poultry keeping, duck raising is unique in that it lends  itself to the greatest degree of specialization and intensification  along lines which are purely commercial. On a comparatively small area  thousands of ducklings can be reared and marketed yearly. The call for  information concerning the methods used by these commercial duck raisers  has been considerable, and since such information is not available in  complete concise form the present book has been prepared partly to  furnish just this information.    The methods used by successful Long Island duck raisers differ widely in  some particulars and since in the space at command, it has been  impossible to describe all the methods used, the plan has been adopted  of detailing in the main the methods of one successful grower. This it  is believed will prove to be more helpful and less confusing than to  attempt to give the method of several different men.    Much space has been given to the operations of the commercial duck  raisers but the fact is recognized that the great bulk of the ducks  entering into the trade of the country is the product of small flocks  kept on general farms. For this reason a chapter has been added dealing  with duck raising on the farm, and attention is here called to the fact  that most of the information given under commercial duck raising can be  readily adapted to use in connection with the farm flock.    Detailed, complete information on goose raising is even more fragmentary  than is the case with ducks. Yet there is a fine opportunity to rear a  few geese at a profit on many farms, and the need and call for  information is quite general. It is for this reason that a section of  this book has been devoted to goose raising and in that section all the  good reliable information available on the subject is given. The special  attention of the women of the farm is directed to the opportunity which  goose raising offers to make a good profit on a small side line with the  minimum of initial investment and of labor.    The greatest care has been taken to make the information on both duck  and goose raising as complete and clear as possible. However, the  authors appreciate the unlimited value of good illustrations in making  clear methods and operations which are more difficult to grasp from a  word description, and have therefore assembled a set of illustrations  for this book, the completeness and excellence of which have never  before been approached in any book on the subject. The illustrations  alone are an education.    In preparing and presenting this book to the public, the authors take  pleasure in acknowledging their deep indebtedness to the following  persons for help and information furnished:    Roy E. Pardee  John C. Kriner  Charles McClave  Stanley Mason  Dr. Balliet  William Minnich  George W. Hackett  Dawson Brothers    Particular acknowledgment is due Robert A. Tuttle for the manner in  which he threw open his duck plant to the authors and for the most  generous amount of time which he gave in furnishing information.    Special acknowledgment is likewise due Alfred R. Lee, Poultryman, U. S.  Department of Agriculture, for information secured from his Farmers'  Bulletins on duck raising and goose raising.

Bishop Museum of Honolulu, Hawaii, to North  Borneo, from June 24, 1962, through January 14, 1963. Most of the time  spent in the then British Colony was devoted to collecting in lowland  habitats. The chief collecting localities were in the vicinity of Quoin  Hill on the Semporna Peninsula, and near Kalabakan. Approximately two  weeks were spent in surveying the Tenom area. Additional work was done  by the North Borneo Department of Agriculture after my departure, mainly  by Antonio D. Garcia.          ACKNOWLEDGMENTS      I am indebted to J. L. Gressitt of the Entomology Department of the  Bishop Museum for providing the opportunity for me to work on the  expedition and to examine and report on the material collected. Without  the help of the North Borneo Department of Agriculture, the success of  our expedition would have been restricted. The Entomologist of North  Borneo, G. R. Conway, was of great help with our logistic problems as  was the Director of the Department, Mr. E. J. H. Berwick, and the  Agronomist of Cocoa Research Station, Ed Wyrley-Birch. The Bombay Burmah  Trading Corporation, Ltd., provided facilities and transportation at  Kalabakan. Mr. Dai Rees of that corporation should be especially  mentioned. Others who helped are: J. A. Comber, Ronnie Young, Mr. and  Mrs. Horace Traulsen, Maureen Wyrley-Birch, and the Resident, Tawau,  Mr. Peter Edge. The Conservator of Forests kindly provided the necessary  permits for collecting.    Authorities of the United States National Museum and The American Museum  of Natural History generously permitted me to work at those  institutions, using their specimens for comparative studies. Other  specimens were borrowed from the Museum of Comparative Zoology,  Rijksmuseum Van Natuurlijke Historie, British Museum (Natural History),  and the Yale Peabody Museum. Dr. Alexander Wetmore, Herbert Deignan, and  Charles Vaurie helped with some of the more difficult taxonomic  problems. Specimens cited in this report are in the Bernice P. Bishop  Museum, The University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, The  University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, and the U. S. National Museum.    Richard F. Johnston and Robert M. Mengel kindly read the manuscript and  made many helpful suggestions. The latter re-read it and assisted with  the editing.    The most recent comprehensive work published previous to my preparation  of manuscript for the present account was Smythies (1960) \"The Birds of  Borneo.\"    This report is a partial result of field work supported by a grant from  the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command,  Department of the Army, to the Bernice P. Bishop Museum for research on  ectoparasites of vertebrates. The contract numbers were  DA-MD-49-193-62-G47 and G65. The Chapman Fund of The American Museum of  Natural History met part of the cost of transporting, to and from the  United States, specimens from North Borneo collected after I left there.
