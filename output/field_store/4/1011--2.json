SEPTEMBER      NO. 3           ================================          BIRD SONG.        How songs are made      Is a mystery,      Which studied for years      Still baffles me.              --R. H. STODDARD.      \"Some birds are poets and sing all summer,\" says Thoreau. \"They are the  true singers. Any man can write verses in the love season. We are most  interested in those birds that sing for the love of music, and not of  their mates; who meditate their strains and amuse themselves with  singing; the birds whose strains are of deeper sentiment.\"    Thoreau does not mention by name any of the poet-birds to which he  alludes, but we think our selections for the present month include some  of them. The most beautiful specimen of all, which is as rich in color  and \"sun-sparkle\" as the most polished gem to which he owes his name,  the Ruby-throated Humming Bird, cannot sing at all, uttering only a  shrill mouse-like squeak. The humming sound made by his wings is far  more agreeable than his voice, for \"when the mild gold stars flower out\"  it announces his presence. Then        \"A dim shape quivers about      Some sweet rich heart of a rose.\"    He hovers over all the flowers that possess the peculiar sweetness that  he loves--the blossoms of the honeysuckle, the red, the white, and the  yellow roses, and the morning glory. The red clover is as sweet to him  as to the honey bee, and a pair of them may often be seen hovering over  the blossoms for a moment, and then disappearing with the quickness of  a flash of light, soon to return to the same spot and repeat the  performance. _Squeak, squeak!_ is probably their call note.    Something of the poet is the Yellow Warbler, though his song is not  quite as long as an epic. He repeats it a little too often, perhaps, but  there is such a pervading cheerfulness about it that we will not quarrel  with the author. _Sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweeter-sweeter!_ is his  frequent contribution to the volume of nature, and all the while he is  darting about the trees, \"carrying sun-glints on his back wherever he  goes.\" His song is appropriate to every season, but it is in the spring,  when we hear it first, that it is doubly welcome to the ear. The  grateful heart asks with Bourdillon:        \"What tidings hath the Warbler heard      That bids him leave the lands of summer      For woods and fields where April yields      Bleak welcome to the blithe newcomer?\"    The Mourning Dove may be called the poet of melancholy, for its song  is, to us, without one element of cheerfulness. Hopeless despair is in  every note, and, as the bird undoubtedly does have cheerful moods, as  indicated by its actions, its song must be appreciated only by its  mate. _Coo-o, coo-o!_ suddenly thrown upon the air and resounding near  and far is something hardly to be extolled, we should think, and yet the  beautiful and graceful Dove possesses so many pretty ways that every one  is attracted to it, and the tender affection of the mated pair is so  manifest, and their constancy so conspicuous, that the name has become  a symbol of domestic concord.    The Cuckoo must utter his note in order to be recognized, for few  that are learned in bird lore can discriminate him save from his  notes. He proclaims himself by calling forth his own name, so that it  is impossible to make a mistake about him. Well, his note is an agreeable  one and has made him famous. As he loses his song in the summer months,  he is inclined to make good use of it when he finds it again. English  boys are so skillful in imitating the Cuckoo's song, which they do to an  exasperating extent, that the bird himself may often wish for that of  the Nightingale, which is inimitable.    But the Cuckoo's song, monotonous as it is, is decidedly to be preferred  to that of the female House Wren, with its _Chit-chit-chit-chit_, when  suspicious or in anger. The male, however, is a real poet, let us  say--and sings a merry roulade, sudden, abruptly ended, and frequently  repeated. He sings, apparently, for the love of music, and is as merry  and gay when his mate is absent as when she is at his side, proving that  his singing is not solely for her benefit.    So good an authority as Dr. Coues vouches for the exquisite vocalization  of the Ruby-crowned Kinglet. Have you ever heard a wire vibrating? Such  is the call note of the Ruby, thin and metallic. But his song has a  fullness, a variety, and a melody, which, being often heard in the  spring migration, make this feathered beauty additionally attractive.  Many of the fine songsters are not brilliantly attired, but this fellow  has a combination of attractions to commend him as worthy of the bird  student's careful attention.    Of the Hermit Thrush, whose song is celebrated, we will say only, \"Read  everything you can find about him.\" He will not be discovered easily,  for even Olive Thorne Miller, who is presumed to know all about birds,  tells of her pursuit of the Hermit in northern New York, where it was  said to be abundant, and finding, when she looked for him, that he had  always \"been there\" and was gone. But one day in August she saw the bird  and heard the song and exclaimed: \"This only was lacking--this crowns my  summer.\"    The Song Sparrow can sing too, and the Phoebe, beloved of man, and the  White-breasted Nuthatch, a little. They do not require the long-seeking  of the Hermit Thrush, whose very name implies that he prefers to flock  by himself, but can be seen in our parks throughout the season. But the  Sparrow loves the companionship of man, and has often been a solace to  him. It is stated by the biographer of Kant, the great metaphysician,  that at the age of eighty he had become indifferent to much that was  passing around him in which he had formerly taken great interest. The  flowers showed their beautious hues to him in vain; his weary vision  gave little heed to their loveliness; their perfume came unheeded to  the sense which before had inhaled it with eagerness. The coming on of  spring, which he had been accustomed to hail with delight, now gave him  no joy save that it brought back a little Sparrow, which came annually  and made its home in a tree that stood by his window. Year after year,  as one generation went the way of all the earth, another would return to  its birth-place to reward the tender care of their benefactor by singing  to him their pleasant songs. And he longed for their return in the  spring with \"an eagerness and intensity of expectation.\"    How many provisions nature has for keeping us simple-hearted and  child-like! The Song Sparrow is one of them.                                         --C. C. MARBLE.           [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  SUMMER YELLOW-BIRD.                  Copyrighted by Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897, Chicago.]    THE YELLOW WARBLER.      In a recent article Angus Gaines describes so delightfully some of the  characteristics of the Yellow Warbler, or Summer Yellow-bird, sometimes  called the Wild Canary, that we are tempted to make use of part of it.  \"Back and forth across the garden the little yellow birds were flitting,  dodging through currant and gooseberry bushes, hiding in the lilacs,  swaying for an instant on swinging sprays of grape vines, and then  flashing out across the garden beds like yellow sunbeams. They were  lithe, slender, dainty little creatures, and were so quick in their  movements that I could not recognize them at first, but when one of them  hopped down before me, lifted a fallen leaf and dragged a cutworm from  beneath it, and, turning his head, gave me a sidewise glance with his  victim still struggling in his beak, I knew him. His gay coat was yellow  without the black cap, wings, and tail which show in such marked  contrast to the bright canary hue of that other yellow bird, the  Gold-finch.    \"Small and delicate as these birds are, they had been on a long journey  to the southward to spend the winter, and now on the first of May, they  had returned to their old home to find the land at its fairest--all  blossoms, buds, balmy air, sunshine, and melody. As they flitted about  in their restless way, they sang the soft, low, warbling trills, which  gave them their name of Yellow Warbler.\"    Mrs. Wright says these beautiful birds come like whirling leaves, half  autumn yellow, half green of spring, the colors blending as in the outer  petals of grass-grown daffodils. \"Lovable, cheerful little spirits,  darting about the trees, exclaiming at each morsel that they glean.  Carrying sun glints on their backs wherever they go, they should make  the gloomiest misanthrope feel the season's charm. They are so sociable  and confiding, feeling as much at home in the trees by the house as in  seclusion.\"    The Yellow-bird builds in bushes, and the nest is a wonderful example of  bird architecture. Milkweed, lint and its strips of fine bark are glued  to twigs, and form the exterior of the nest. Its inner lining is made of  the silky down on dandelion-balls woven together with horse-hair. In  this dainty nest are laid four or five creamy white eggs, speckled with  lilac tints and red-browns. The unwelcome egg of the Cow-bird is often  found in the Yellow-bird's nest, but this Warbler builds a floor over  the egg, repeating the expedient, if the Cow-bird continues her  mischief, until sometimes a third story is erected.    A pair of Summer Yellow-birds, we are told, had built their nest in  a wild rose bush, and were rearing their family in a wilderness of  fragrant blossoms whose tinted petals dropped upon the dainty nest, or  settled upon the back of the brooding mother. The birds, however, did  not stay \"to have their pictures taken,\" but their nest may be seen  among the roses.

This is the second volume of a series intended to present, in accurate  colored portraiture, and in popular and juvenile biographical text, a  very considerable portion of the common birds of North America, and many  of the more interesting and attractive specimens of other countries, in  many respects superior to all other publications which have attempted  the representation of birds, and at infinitely less expense. The  appreciative reception by the public of Vol. I deserves our grateful  acknowledgement. Appearing in monthly parts, it has been read and  admired by thousands of people, who, through the life-like pictures  presented, have made the acquaintance of many birds, and have since  become enthusiastic observers of them. It has been introduced into  the public schools, and is now in use as a text book by hundreds of  teachers, who have expressed enthusiastic approval of the work and of  its general extension. The faithfulness to nature of the pictures, in  color and pose, have been commended by such ornithologists and authors  as Dr. Elliott Coues, Mr. John Burroughs, Mr. J. W. Allen, editor of  _The Auk_, Mr. Frank M. Chapman, Mr. J. W. Baskett, and others.    The general text of BIRDS--the biographies--has been conscientiously  prepared from the best authorities by a careful observer of the  feather-growing denizens of the field, the forest, and the shore, while  the juvenile autobiographies have received the approval of the highest  ornithological authority.    The publishers take pleasure in the announcement that the general  excellence of BIRDS will be maintained in subsequent volumes. The  subjects selected for the third and fourth volumes--many of them--will  be of the rare beauty in which the great Audubon, the limner _par  excellence_ of birds, would have found \"the joy of imitation.\"                                          NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING COMPANY.

JULY        NO. 1           ================================          BIRD SONG.      It should not be overlooked by the young observer that if he would  learn to recognize at once any particular bird, he should make himself  acquainted with the song and call notes of every bird around him. The  identification, however, of the many feathered creatures with which we  meet in our rambles has heretofore required so much patience, that,  though a delight to the enthusiast, few have time to acquire any great  intimacy with them. To get this acquaintance with the birds, the  observer has need to be prepared to explore perilous places, to climb  lofty trees, and to meet with frequent mishaps. To be sure if every  veritable secret of their habits is to be pried into, this pursuit will  continue to be plied as patiently as it has ever been. The opportunity,  however, to secure a satisfactory knowledge of bird song and bird life  by a most delightful method has at last come to every one.    A gentleman who has taken a great interest in BIRDS from the appearance  of the first number, but whose acquaintance with living birds is quite  limited, visited one of our parks a few days ago, taking with him the  latest number of the magazine. His object, he said, was to find there  as many of the living forms of the specimens represented as he could.  \"Seating myself amidst a small grove of trees, what was my delight at  seeing a Red Wing alight on a telegraph wire stretching across the park.  Examining the picture in BIRDS I was somewhat disappointed to find that  the live specimen was not so brilliantly marked as in the picture.  Presently, however, another Blackbird alighted near, who seemed to be  the veritable presentment of the photograph. Then it occured to me  that I had seen the Red Wing before, without knowing its name. It kept  repeating a rich, juicy note, _oncher-la-ree-e!_ its tail tetering at  quick intervals. A few days later I observed a large number of Red Wings  near the Hyde Park water works, in the vicinity of which, among the  trees and in the marshes, I also saw many other birds unknown to me.  With BIRDS in my hands, I identified the Robin, who ran along the ground  quite close to me, anon summoning with his beak the incautious angle  worm to the surface. The Jays were noisy and numerous, and I observed  many new traits in the Wood Thrush, so like the Robin that I was at  first in some doubt about it. I heard very few birds sing that day, most  of them being busy in search of food for their young.\"    [CONTINUED ON PAGE 17.]          THE BALD-HEADED EAGLE.      Dear Boys and Girls:    I had hoped to show you the picture of the eagle that went through the  war with the soldiers. They called him \"Old Abe.\" You will find on page  35 a long story written about him. Ask some one to read it to you.    I could not get \"Old Abe,\" or you should now be looking at his picture.  He is at present in Wisconsin, and his owner would not allow him to be  taken from home.    I did the next best thing, and found one that was very much like him.  They are as near alike as two children of a family. Old Abe's feathers  are not quite so smooth, though. Do you wonder, after having been  through the war? He is a veteran, isn't he?    The picture is that of a Bald-headed Eagle. He is known, also, by other  names, such as White-headed Eagle, Bird of Washington, Sea Eagle.    You can easily see by the picture that he is not bald-headed. The name  White-headed would seem a better name. It is because at a distance his  head and neck appear as though they were covered with a white skin.    He is called \"Sea Eagle\" because his food is mostly fish. He takes the  fish that are thrown upon the shores by the waves, and sometimes he robs  the Fish Hawk of his food.    This mighty bird usually places his large nest in some tall tree. He  uses sticks three to five feet long, large pieces of sod, weeds, moss,  and whatever he can find.    The nest is sometimes five or six feet through. Eagles use the same nest  for years, adding to it each year.    Young eagles are queer looking birds. When hatched, they are covered  with a soft down that looks like cotton.    Their parents feed them, and do not allow them to leave the nest until  they are old enough to fly. When they are old enough, the mother bird  pushes them out of the nest. She must be sure that they can fly, or she  would not dare do this. Don't you think so?     [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  AMERICAN BALD EAGLE.]          THE BALD-HEADED EAGLE.      This mighty bird of lofty flight is a native of the whole of North  America, and may be seen haunting the greater portions of the sea  coasts, as well as the mouths of large rivers. He is sometimes called  the White-headed Eagle, the American Sea Eagle, the Bird of Washington,  the Washington Eagle, and the Sea Eagle. On account of the snowy white  of his head and neck, the name Bald Eagle has been applied to him more  generally than any other.    Sea-faring men are partial to young Eagles as pets, there being a well  established superstition among them that the ship that carries the \"King  of Birds\" can never go down. The old Romans, in selecting the Eagle as  an emblem for their imperial standard, showed this superstitious belief,  regarding him as the favorite messenger of Jupiter, holding communion  with heaven. The Orientals, too, believed that the feathers of the  Eagle's tail rendered their arrows invincible. The Indian mountain  tribes east of Tennessee venerated the Eagle as their bird of war, and  placed a high value on his feathers, which they used for headdresses and  to decorate their pipes of peace.    The United States seems to have an abiding faith in the great bird, as  our minted dollars show.    The nest of the Bald Eagle is usually placed upon the top of a giant  tree, standing far up on the side of a mountain, among myriads of  twining vines, or on the summit of a high inaccessible rock. The nest in  the course of years, becomes of great size as the Eagle lays her eggs  year after year in the same nest, and at each nesting season adds new  material to the old nest. It is strongly and comfortably built with  large sticks and branches, nearly flat, and bound together with twining  vines. The spacious interior is lined with hair and moss, so minutely  woven together as to exclude the wind. The female lays two eggs of a  brownish red color, with many dots and spots, the long end of the egg  tapering to a point. The parents are affectionate, attend to their young  as long as they are helpless and unfledged, and will not forsake them  even though the tree on which they rest be enveloped in flames. When the  Eaglets are ready to fly, however, the parents push them from the perch  and trust them to the high atmospheric currents. They turn them out, so  to speak, to shift for themselves.    The Bald Eagle has an accommodating appetite, eating almost anything  that has ever had life. He is fond of fish, without being a great  fisher, preferring to rob the Fish-hawk of the fruits of his skillful  labor. Sitting upon the side of a mountain his keen vision surveys  the plain or valley, and detects a sheep, a young goat, a fat turkey  or rooster, a pig, a rabbit or a large bird, and almost within an  eye-twinkle he descends upon his victim. A mighty grasp, a twist of his  talons, and the quarry is dead long before the Eagle lays it down for a  repast. The impetuosity and skill with which he pursues, overtakes and  robs the Fish-hawk, and the swiftness with which the Bald Eagle darts  down upon and seizes"]]]
