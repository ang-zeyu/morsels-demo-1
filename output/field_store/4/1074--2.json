A Transcription from the Original Statute of Anne          Statute of Anne: Preparer's Notes    Created from various public domain versions.      Repetition of last words on pages eliminated,  Latin intro and extro translated into English.  End of line hyphenations removed for searching.  Typo of \"peny\" for \"penny\" has been corrected,  with the elimination of the accompanying sic.  Also \"seasonable\" replaced by \"reasonable\" with  the removal of that sic, as well.  \"Queens\" is  replaced with \"queen's\", and \"majesties\" would  become \"majesty's\", \"entred\" becomes \"entered\"  and these typos were often in multiple places.    \"Vice-Chancellors\" and \"Vice Chancellors\" both  appeared so I chose \"Vice Chancellors\" just to  make searches more simple.    I have not changed any of the apparently quite  random capitalizations [random in comparisons,  I should say to German, etc.], nor changed any  of the more different spellings, as inhaunced.    I would like to comment just how obvious it is  that the rights of the authors was an \"add on\"  to this document, taking place only on a sixth  sheet containing only two small paragraphs, as  this makes it even more obvious just how every  right was originally for \"The Stationers,\" who  are now descended as by The World Intellectual  Property Organization through various means.    This law was proposed and defeated 250 years--  from its first draft by The Stationers just as  The Gutenberg Press got going to this period.    All monarchs, and Oliver Cromwell, refused it,  on grounds it gave too much to The Stationers,  and left too little to the public, as per:    Henry VI        1 Sep 1422    4 Mar 1461  Edward IV       4 Mar 1461    9 Apr 1483  [Henry VI - restored 9 Oct 1470 to c.

More marvellous  still is the growth of the human soul which in many respects resembles  the development of the butterfly. It is this thought which has induced  the author to attempt to depict the transformation of a careless maiden  into noble womanhood.    In this first book, the process has begun. There are heart burnings, and  troubles of girlhood. In the second book, the journeyings and adventures  with her father, together with her development of character are treated.  The third, and final volume, takes up the bursting into glorious  womanhood of the girl, glorified by the coming of love.    For the curious facts and superstitions regarding butterflies woven into  the story, the author desires to acknowledge her indebtedness to Dr. W.  J. Holland's Butterfly Book, which is a compendium of knowledge on the  subject. That the story may meet with favor, and inspire young hearts  with an appreciation of these beautiful insects is the hope of the  author.    L. F. M.    New York City.          Bee and Butterfly          Chapter I    An Impulse of Mischief        \"When to mischief mortals bend their will,      How soon they find fit instruments of ill.\"        --_Pope. Rape of the Lock._      It was four o'clock. The little town of Louisiana, Missouri, had  slumbered all afternoon in the spring sunshine, but woke suddenly to  life as the doors of the big brick school house opened, and the boys and  girls poured forth. As the outgoing stream of pupils reached the gate  several High School girls left the line, and withdrawing a short  distance from the others, formed a little group by themselves, standing  with faces turned expectantly toward the door of the building as though  they were waiting for some one.    \"I wonder why Bee doesn't come!\" exclaimed one of the girls impatiently  as the line dwindled to two or three pupils, and then ceased altogether.  \"I don't see why she pokes around that old school house so long?\"    \"She was going to help Professor Lawrence with some specimens,\" spoke a  tall girl quickly. \"You know Bee likes--\"    \"Bugs,\" finished the other girl with a shiver. \"Oo-ooh! I wouldn't  handle the worms, and creepy, crawly things that Bee Raymond does for  anything.\"    \"It isn't bugs at all,\" answered the tall girl with a trace of  indignation in her voice. \"It's caterpillars and butterflies. Bee's  making a special study of them so as to surprise her father when he  comes from abroad. He's a Lepidopterist, you know, and she is working to  fit herself to be his secretary.\"    \"Is he coming home soon, Edna?\" queried one of the others.    \"Not for two more years,\" responded Edna, who seemed to be well informed  on the matter. \"And just think, girls! Bee hasn't seen him for ten  years.\"    \"Fancy not seeing one's own father in all that time,\" remarked the girl  who had first spoken. \"Of course, it's just splendid to get letters from  abroad, and to have all those lovely things he sends her; but I don't  know, I think I'd rather have my father.\"    \"Why, so would Bee,\" laughed Edna. \"She's just crazy for him to come  home. She--\"    \"There she is now,\" cried one, and with new interest each member of the  group turned to look at the girl who at this moment came through the  door of the school house.    Beatrice Raymond was a slender girl, tall for her fifteen years, with  movements full of unconscious grace; for she had always been much in the  open air and was accustomed to perfect freedom in her limbs. She could  run as fast and jump as far as many boys who \"fancied\" themselves as  athletes. Her hair was very dark, very straight, and very abundant. Her  eyes were large, dark, and expressive; her complexion was dark also and  without color. She created the thought in the minds of those observers  who looked below the surface that there was intellect--thoughtful,  loving, and perhaps unusual intellect. A strap of books was flung over  her left shoulder, boy fashion, and her hat was set carelessly on one  side of her head. She was laughing as she came to them, and the girls  crowded around her eagerly.    \"What's the joke, Bee?\" cried Edna.    \"It's a conundrum,\" answered Beatrice merrily. \"Professor Lawrence just  told it to me. See if any of you can answer it: 'Why are caterpillars  like buckwheat cakes?'\"    \"Pooh! that's easy. Because they make the butter fly,\" answered one of  the group. The others shouted with laughter as Bee turned an astonished  look upon her.    \"How did you know?\" she asked. \"Professor Lawrence just told it to me.\"    \"Why, Beatrice Raymond, that joke was old before Professor Lawrence was  born,\" said the one called Edna. \"It's as old as--as the hills, and may  be older for all I know. If you weren't so deep in that old Butterfly  book you would have heard it long ago. Here! let me fix that hat. What  would your Aunt Annie say if you were to come home with it at an angle  of forty-five degrees?\"    \"Is it so bad as all that, Edna?\" asked Bee indifferently. \"Someway, I  never do get my things on right. Now Adele's are always just so. I do  believe that she could dress in the dark, and come out looking as neat  as a pin.\"    \"Where is Adele, Bee? Why didn't she come to school this afternoon?\"    \"She was not feeling well, so Aunt Annie thought it best to keep her  home,\" answered Beatrice. \"Aren't you going now, girls? I must hurry.\"    \"Oh, Bee! why?\" came from the group in a chorus. \"We've been waiting for  you ever so long so that you could go with us to Edna's. Do come! It  won't be any fun unless you do.\"    \"I can't,\" replied Bee. \"I'd like to ever so much, but I must finish my  letter to father. It has to be written today so that it can reach New  York in time for Saturday's steamer.\"    \"Will you come tomorrow then?\" asked Edna. \"You and Adele too.\"    \"Yes, if Aunt Annie doesn't mind. Now I must go. Good-bye, girls.\"    \"Bee,\" called one as Beatrice started on at a brisk walk.    \"Well?\" Bee paused good naturedly.    \"Edna was telling us how long your father had been away, and I want to  ask you if you think he would know you if he were to meet you  unexpectedly?\"    \"Oh, Sue, that's mean!\" came from the girls in shocked tones. \"Don't  answer her, Bee.\"    \"But I don't ask for meanness,\" went on Sue apologetically as she saw  the look that came into Bee's eyes. \"I really want to know.\"    \"Why, of course he would know me,\" uttered Bee hastily. \"I'm his  daughter.\"    \"Yes; but--\" began the irrepressible Sue, when Edna caught her about the  waist and pressed one hand firmly over her mouth.    \"Go on, Bee,\" she cried. \"I'll attend to her. You'll have to hurry if  you get home in time to finish that letter.\"    Beatrice turned, and slowly went on her way. Her uncle's house, where  she lived, was in the western outskirts of the town more than a mile  distant from the school. It behooved her to hasten if she were to finish  her letter before tea time, but that question of Sue's had set her to  thinking.    On the death of her mother, ten years before, her father, overwhelmed  with grief at his loss, had accepted an offer to go abroad to complete a  collection of lepidoptera for Union University, leaving her in charge  of his brother's family. His letters had been frequent, and so tender  and loving that the question of recognition had never occurred to her.    The houses became fewer as Beatrice reached the edge of town where the  main street became a turnpike with green fields on either side, and a  clear view of the distant hills. It was a beautiful April day. At the  opening of the month spring had smiled invitingly; then, as though  repenting her forwardness, she had retreated for a time, advancing again  with coy hesitancy until today all her windows were open toward summer.  In the zenith was"]]]
