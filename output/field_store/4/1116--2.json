Chapter XXXIX.        Chapter XL.        Conclusion.  Index.  Footnotes              INTRODUCTION BY THE AMERICAN EDITOR.      Both the general purpose of the venerable Johann Arndt in writing his  \"TRUE CHRISTIANITY,\" and also his own character and spirit, will be best  exhibited by submitting to the reader a statement referring to his  personal history. He was born, December 27th, 1555, in Ballenstaedt, a town  in the Duchy of Anhalt, where his father, Rev. Jacob Arndt, long labored  as the chaplain of Duke Wolfgang, and the pastor of one of the Evangelical  Lutheran congregations of the place. The latter was a devout and faithful  minister of the Gospel, and a wise and affectionate father. He had, from  the earliest period, devoted much attention to the religious education of  his son, in the performance of which holy duty he was faithfully sustained  by his excellent wife. Their efforts were abundantly blessed. The son,  even in his early years, took great pleasure in reading the writings of  Luther, and also acquired a fondness for those of Thomas a Kempis, of  Tauler, and of others who breathed the same spirit of devotion. That this  feature of his religious character did not undergo any essential change in  his riper years, appears from the circumstance that he was one of the  first who collected, arranged, and republished the religious tracts of  Stephen Praetorius, a Lutheran divine of an eminently devout spirit. These  were subsequently re-edited by Martin Statius, who prefixed the title:  _Spiritual Treasury_ (Geistliche Schatzkammer), to the collection. This  book of devotion was highly prized by Spener, has often been reprinted, is  found in many German households, and well deserves to be translated, and  thus made accessible to the English religious public.    ยง 2. In his tenth year Arndt lost his father, but the orphan soon found  friends who, in the good providence of God, enabled him to continue the  studies which he had commenced with distinguished success under the  guidance of his father. After completing his preparatory education in the  schools of Halberstadt and Magdeburg, he proceeded, in the year 1576, to  the university of Helmstedt, which had recently been established. In the  course of the following year, 1577, he went as a student to the university  of Wittenberg, soon after the official recognition of the principles  embodied in the Formula of Concord (published in 1580), by which that  institution received a strictly Lutheran character, and every tendency to  any other doctrinal system was successfully arrested. It was here that he  formed a very close union, first as a student, and then as a personal  friend, with the eminent Polycarp Leyser, the elder of that name, whose  firmness and devotion in sustaining the distinctive features of  Lutheranism have assigned to him a high position in the history of his  Church.--After Arndt had, even at this early age, acquired distinction as  an accomplished private lecturer on Natural Philosophy, etc., as well as  on the Epistle to the Romans, Leyser furnished him with an unusually  favorable recommendation to the professors in Strasburg. This city, the  government and population of which were exclusively Lutheran, had not yet  been subjected to that great calamity which afterwards befell it, when the  despot and bigot, Louis XIV., incorporated it with the French monarchy,  and by assigning undue privileges to papists, and adopting other  tyrannical measures, opened an avenue for the introduction, not merely of  an inferior Romanic language, but also of the errors and superstitions of  the Church of Rome.    ยง 3. Arndt continued his theological studies in Strasburg, under the  direction of Prof. Pappus, who was also distinguished for his devotion to  the genuine Lutheran faith. In the year 1579 he proceeded to Basel, where,  under the gentle sway of Sulcer, the Lutheran faith had acquired influence  and authority. In this city he was temporarily engaged as the tutor of a  young Polish nobleman; the latter, on one of their excursions, when Arndt  had accidentally fallen into the Rhine, succeeded in seizing his sinking  preceptor by the hair of his head, and thus became the means, in the hands  of God, of saving a life of incalculable value, designed to prove an  ever-flowing source of blessings to the Church.    ยง 4. During this whole period Arndt occupied himself with the study of  medicine, in connection with his strictly theological studies; it is  possible that he would have ultimately chosen the practice of medicine as  the business of his life, if a severe illness had not intervened. After  his recovery, he believed it to be his duty to renounce his personal  tastes, and he thenceforth consecrated himself entirely to the service of  the Church. His medical and chemical occupations, although not abandoned,  were afterwards regarded by him only as a recreation.    ยง 5. He returned, in 1581 or 1582, to his native place, and labored for  some time as a teacher, until he was called by his prince, Joachim Ernest,  to be the pastor of the congregation in Badeborn, a village in the Duchy  of Anhalt; he was, accordingly, ordained in the month of October of the  same year. It was here, too, that he was married, October 31, 1583, to  Anna Wagner, the daughter of an eminent jurist, with whom he passed the  remaining thirty-eight years of his life in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34737"],[0,"Beethoven : The story of a little boy who was forced to practice (#1)"],[1,"CHILD'S OWN BOOK                             of Great Musicians                                   BEETHOVEN                                 [Illustration]                                       By                               THOMAS TAPPER                              THEODORE PRESSER CO.                            1712 CHESTNUT STREET                                PHILADELPHIA                                       [Illustration]                             Directions for Binding      Enclosed in this envelope is the cord and the needle with which to bind  this book.

THEO. PRESSER CO., Pub's., Phila., Pa.                                    HOW TO USE THIS BOOK      This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF GREAT  MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of \"Pictures from the Lives  of the Great Composers for Children,\" \"Music Talks with Children,\"  \"First Studies in Music Biography,\" and others.    The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the  child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place  throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as  will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to  cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the  corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around  each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.    After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the  book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the  great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous  pages.    The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the  cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's  own book.    This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting  task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to  the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth  while.                       *       *       *       *       *    This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians includes at  present a book on each of the following:        Bach                    Grieg                   Mozart      Beethoven               Handel                  Nevin      Brahms                  Haydn                   Schubert      Chopin                  Liszt                   Schumann      Dvorak                  MacDowell               Tschaikowsky      Foster                  Mendelssohn             Verdi                                                      Wagner                                   [Illustration: No. 1]                             [Illustration: No. 13]                             [Illustration: No. 8]                             [Illustration: No. 4]                             [Illustration: No. 5]                             [Illustration: No. 3]                             [Illustration: No. 6]                             [Illustration: No. 9]                                   [Illustration: No. 7]                             [Illustration: No. 10]                             [Illustration: No. 14]                             [Illustration: No. 15]                             [Illustration: No. 16]                             [Illustration: No. 12]                             [Illustration: No. 11]                                         BEETHOVEN                           The Story of a Little Boy                         Who Was Forced to Practice                               This Book was made by                           ..........................

DIED                         ..................................                    The Story of a Little Boy who was Forced to Practice      Ludwig van Beethoven was born in the lovely town of Bonn, on the River  Rhine, December 16, 1770.    The house in which he spent his boyhood is still standing. We see in the  picture what a pretty, homelike place the house and the yard must have  been. It is now the Beethoven House, or Museum, filled with mementos of  the great composer. There you may see music pages written by him,  letters, medals, instruments; even his ear trumpet is there.                      [Illustration: THE BEETHOVEN HOUSE]    Beethoven's father was a singer at the Chapel of the Elector. He was not  a good father, for he did not care to work even enough to make his  family comfortable. But the mother loved her boy with all her heart, as  we shall see.                              [Illustration: No. 3                              BEETHOVEN'S FATHER]    Ludwig was only four years old when he began to study music. Like  children of to-day he shed many a tear over the first lessons. In the  beginning his father taught him piano and violin, and forced him to  practice. At school he learned, just as we do to-day, reading, writing,  arithmetic, and later on, Latin.                              [Illustration: No. 4                               THE FIRST LESSON]    Never again after thirteen, did Ludwig go to school for he had to work  and earn his living.    Do you wonder what kind of a boy he was?    We are told that he was shy and quiet. He talked little and took no  interest in the games that his boy and girl companions played.    While Ludwig was in school he played at a concert for the first time. He  was then eight years old. Two years later he had composed quite a number  of pieces. One of these was printed. It was called _Variations on  Dressler's March_. On the title page of this piece it said:--                       **********************************                     * VARIATIONS ON DRESSLER'S MARCH *                     *  Composed by a Young Amateur   *                     *      LOUIS VAN BEETHOVEN       *                     *      Aged ten years. 1780      *                     **********************************    Then the little boy studied with a teacher named Christian Gottlob  Neefe, who took real interest in him. Neefe did not, as was said of  Beethoven's father, punish the little boy severely to keep him at his  practice, hour after hour.    Often when Neefe had to travel Ludwig took his teacher's place as  organist at the Court. Then with the organ lessons there were other  lessons in Harmony. So rapidly did the boy improve that his teacher said  one day:    \"If he goes on as he has begun, he will some day be a second Mozart.\"    Our young hero of thirteen was surely busy every hour of the day. He  played in an orchestra, as accompanist. He gave lessons, played the  organ in church, studied the violin, and kept up his work in  composition. He always kept a note-book for musical ideas.    Most every child in these days has more and better opportunities than  had the great Beethoven when he was a child. Here is a picture of the  funny old organ in the Minorite Church of Bonn upon which Beethoven  played when he was a little boy.                              [Illustration: No. 5                               BEETHOVEN'S ORGAN]    Look at the funny stops at the top and compare it with the best organ in  your own town. This is little better than a toy beside our fine organs  of to-day,--yet it was the best that Beethoven had to practice upon.    When Neefe said that he would probably be a second Mozart the words  filled Ludwig with a great desire. On his sixteenth birthday what do you  think happened? Why, he set out from Bonn to Vienna, where Mozart lived.    But scarcely had he begun to feel at home in Vienna when news came to  him that his mother was ill. She had always been a good mother, kind of  heart, great of hope for her little boy, and probably she sympathized  with the hard lot that made him have to work so early in life. When he  learned of her sickness he hastened to Bonn.    Who was happier, he said to one of his friends, than I, so long as I was  able to speak the sweet name of Mother and know that she heard me?                              [Illustration: No. 6                               BEETHOVEN'S MOTHER]    Vienna had given him a wonderful happiness. He met Mozart and had some  lessons from him in composition. When he played for the great master,  Mozart tip-toed from the room and said softly to those present:    \"Pay heed to this boy. He will surely make a noise in the world some  day.\"                              [Illustration: No. 7                              BEETHOVEN AND MOZART]    After his Mother's death he determined that he would remain there. And  it was not until he talked with Joseph Haydn, who stopped at Bonn on his  way to London, that he decided once more to journey to Vienna. Beethoven  was twenty-two years old at the time he met Papa Haydn. Beethoven showed  the master some of his compositions. Haydn urged him to go at once to  Vienna, promising to give him lessons in composition on his return from  London.
