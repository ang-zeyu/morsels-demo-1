A Guide to Their Identification  in the Water_, by S. Leatherwood, W.E. Evans, and D.W. Rice (NUC TP  282). This guide was designed to assist the layman in identifying the  cetaceans he encountered in that area and was intended for use in two  ongoing whale observer programs, NUC's Whale Watch and NMFS's Platforms  of Opportunity. The rationale of these programs was that since  oceanographers, commercial and sport fishermen, naval personnel,  commercial seamen, pleasure boaters, and coastal aircraft pilots  together canvas large areas of the oceans which scientists specializing  in whales (cetologists) have time and funds to survey only occasionally,  training those persons in species identification and asking them to  report their sightings back to central data centers could help  scientists more clearly understand distribution, migration, and seasonal  variations in abundance of cetacean species. For such a program to work,  a usable field guide is a requisite. Because the many publications on  the whales, dolphins, and porpoises of this region were either too  technical in content or too limited in geographical area or species  covered to be of use in field identification, and because conventional  scientific or taxonomic groupings of the animals are often not helpful  in field identification, the photographic field guide took a different  approach. Instead of being placed into their scientific groups, species  were grouped together on the basis of similarities in appearance during  the brief encounters typical at sea. Photographs of the animals in their  natural environment, supplemented by drawings and descriptions or tables  distinguishing the most similar species, formed the core of the guide.    Despite deficiencies in the first effort and the inherent difficulties  of positively identifying many of the cetacean species at sea, the  results obtained from the programs have been encouraging. Many seafarers  who had previously looked with disinterest or ignorance on the animals  they encountered became good critical observers and found pleasure in  the contribution they were making. The potential for the expansion of  such observer programs is enormous.    Because of these initial successes and the large number of requests for  packets from persons working at sea off the Atlantic coast of North  America, this guide was planned. Many of the errors and deficiencies of  the Pacific Guide have been corrected, and the discussions of the ranges  of many of the species have been expanded with considerations of the  major oceanographic factors affecting their distribution and movements.  While the present volume, like the Pacific Guide, is intended as an aid  to the identification of living animals at sea, new materials have been  provided to aid in the identification and reporting of stranded  specimens, a major source of data and study material for museums. This  new dimension is expected to assist the U.S. National Museum, various  regional museums, and other researchers actively collecting cetacean  materials for display and study in the implementation of their stranded  animal salvage programs. Through a cooperative effort of this kind, the  best possible use can be made of all materials that become available.    As a part of continuing research, this guide will be revised whenever  possible. Suggestions for its improvement will at all times be welcome.           *       *       *       *       *    Funds for the preparation of this guide were provided by a grant to  Stephen Leatherwood from the Platforms of Opportunity Program, National  Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, Tiburon, Calif., Paul Sund, Coordinator.

Some parts  of the country, because of their accessibility, soon became relatively  well known; other regions lying off the beaten path were bypassed or  inadequately sampled. Principally in the last decade herpetologists have  been entering regions from which no collections previously were  available in an attempt to fill gaps in known distributions and to  discover unknown species of animals. In 1950 Dr. Donald D. Brand led an  exploration party from the University of Texas to the poorly explored  and faunistically unknown region of southwestern Michoacan. James A.  Peters accompanied Brand and collected amphibians and reptiles. In 1951  I welcomed the opportunity to accompany Brand on a second expedition to  southwestern Michoacan. Such was the beginning of my interest in the  herpetofauna of the region. I have been fortunate to return to Michoacan  on four successive trips, all of which had as their purpose the  accumulation of data on the herpetofauna that would result in a survey  of the component species and an analysis of their distribution.    My original intention was to amplify Peters' (1954) study based on the  collections made by him in 1950 and by me in 1951 in the Sierra de  Coalcoman. But it soon became evident that in order to understand the  relationships of the herpetofauna of the Sierra de Coalcoman, the  species inhabiting the Tepalcatepec Valley and adjacent mountain ranges  would have to be studied. In the course of making that study I examined  all specimens from Michoacan already in museums.    There have been few detailed herpetofaunal studies in Mexico. The first  such study of any consequence was that by Bogert and Oliver (1945) on  the herpetofauna of Sonora. In that paper the authors analyzed the fauna  from a geographic view and showed the transition from tropical species  in the southern part of the state to members of the Sonoran Desert  assemblage to the north. Martin (1958) made a detailed study of the  herpetofauna of the Gomez Farias region in southern Tamaulipas; he  emphasized the ecological distribution of amphibians and reptiles in  that region with special reference to cloud forests. Duellman (1958c)  presented a preliminary geographic analysis of the herpetofauna of  Colima with special reference to the continuity of the species  inhabiting the lowlands. Zweifel (1960) discussed in detail the  herpetofauna of the Tres Marias Islands and commented on the derivation  of the fauna. Duellman (1960d) provided a detailed account of the  geographic distribution of the amphibians known to occur in the lowlands  of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and attempted to account for the present  patterns of distribution.    The present report is the first of two parts dealing with the  herpetofauna of Michoacan. The purpose of this part is to present a full  account of the species of amphibians and reptiles known to inhabit the  state of Michoacan; the accounts of the species are accompanied by a  brief description of the natural landscape and of the various  assemblages of species comprising the major faunistic groups within the  region. A gazetteer of collecting localities is appended. The second  part of the study, now in preparation, deals with the ecological and  historical geography of the herpetofauna. Since the present part will be  of interest primarily to systematic herpetologists, I have decided to  separate it from the more general material of interest to  biogeographers.    One of the major problems that faces the worker undertaking a faunal  study is the presence of species or genera of unsettled systematic  status. My work in Michoacan has been no exception; fifteen separate  studies were undertaken in an attempt to solve systematic problems in  certain groups. Some systematic problems still remain but are of little  consequence insofar as the entire faunal picture is concerned, or are so  involved as to be impractical to undertake at this time. In accounts of  species, such problems are mentioned in the hope that they will interest  some worker who will be inclined to investigate them.      ACKNOWLEDGMENTS    While engaged in the study of the herpetofauna of Michoacan I have built  up a debt of gratitude to many individuals, without whose aid my  ambition to complete my study never would have been realized. I am  especially grateful to those individuals who accompanied me in the  field; Lee D. Beatty, Richard E. Etheridge, Carter R. Gilbert, Fred G.  Thompson, Jerome Tulecke, and John Wellman offered stimulating  companionship and valuable assistance. On many occasions they suffered  hardships on behalf of my interests.    Studies of my own specimens have been augmented by material from other  institutions. For permitting me to examine specimens in their care I am  indebted to W. Frank Blair, Charles M. Bogert, Doris M. Cochran, William  B. Davis, James R. Dixon, the late Emmett R. Dunn, Josef Eiselt, Alice  G. C. Grandison, Norman Hartweg, Robert F. Inger, Arthur Loveridge, the  late Karl P. Schmidt, Hobart M. Smith, Robert C. Stebbins, Margaret  Storey, Edward H. Taylor, and Richard G. Zweifel.    Several people have aided me in the study of specimens and in the  analysis of data; I am grateful to Donald D. Brand, who first introduced  me to Michoacan; since that time I have benefited much from his  knowledge of the area. James A. Peters provided me with essential  information concerning his field work in southern Michoacan in 1950.  James R. Dixon and Floyd L. Downs have permitted me to use freely the  material and data that they accumulated in their recent field work in  Michoacan. Norman E. Hartweg allowed me to use the specimens and data  that he gathered in his survey of the herpetofauna in the region of  Volcan Paricutin. L. C. Stuart, Charles F. Walker, and Richard G.  Zweifel have helped in unraveling some of the systematic and  distributional problems.    I am especially grateful to my wife, Ann, who for six months helped me  track down elusive species and explore new areas. Furthermore, she has  stimulated me to carry this study to completion.    Many people in Michoacan favored the field parties with quarters,  transportation, and valuable information, which greatly facilitated the  field work. In this respect I am especially indebted to Ingeniero Ruben  Erbina of Ingenieros Civiles Asociados, who not only let us use his home  as our headquarters, but through a letter of introduction gave us the  \"key\" to southern Michoacan. Ingeniero Pedro Tonda aided us in Arteaga  and San Salvador. Ingeniero Anastacio Perez Alfaro of the Comision  Tepalcatepec in Uruapan provided the latest maps of southern Michoacan  and much essential information pertaining to travel conditions in the  area. Senor Nefty Mendoza gave us a home in Dos Aguas; this kindness  allowed us to work in this interesting region during the height of the  rainy season. Mr. and Mrs. Bob Thomas let us make use of their  facilities at Hacienda Zirimicuaro. The naval officers at the Estacion  Marina at Playa Azul made pleasant what might have been a dreadful stay  in that small coastal village. To the managers and pilots of Lineas  Aereas Picho in Uruapan I owe special thanks for going out of their way  on more than one occasion to transport a stranded snake-hunter.  Throughout the months of field work beginning in 1955 I constantly have  been aided by the authorities and workers of the Comision Tepalcatepec,  a subdivision of the Secretaria de Caminos y Obras Publicas, and of the  private corporation, Ingenieros Civiles Asociados. Much of the field  work in Michoacan was made possible only through the co-operation of the  natives who supplied mules, acted as guides, and aided in the collection  of specimens. I have learned a great deal from these people. They will  never see this report. Their work as guides, muleteers, and collectors  greatly assisted me with the mountains of equipment that had to be piled  on the backs of scrawny mules for transportation to"]]]
