Chapter I    Introduction    The literature of our time, as of all the centuries of  Christendom, is full of allusions to the gods and goddesses of  the Greeks and Romans.  Occasionally, and, in modern days, more  often, it contains allusions to the worship and the superstitions  of the northern nations of Europe.  The object of this book is to  teach readers who are not yet familiar with the writers of Greece  and Rome, or the ballads or legends of the Scandinavians, enough  of the stories which form what is called their mythology, to make  those allusions intelligible which one meets every day, even in  the authors of our own time.    The Greeks and Romans both belong to the same race or stock.  It  is generally known in our time as the Aryan family of mankind;  and so far as we know its history, the Greeks and Romans  descended from the tribes which emigrated from the high table-  lands of Northern India.  Other tribes emigrated in different  directions from the same centre, so that traces of the Aryan  language are found in the islands of the Pacific ocean.    The people of this race, who moved westward, seem to have had a  special fondness for open air nature, and a willingness to  personify the powers of nature.  They were glad to live in the  open air, and they specially encouraged the virtues which an  open-air people prize.  Thus no Roman was thought manly who could  not swim, and every Greek exercised in the athletic sports of the  palaestra.    The Romans and Grecian and German divisions of this great race "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33287"],[0,"Hints on the Use and Handling of Firearms Generally, and the Revolver in (#1)"],[1,"at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from  images generously made available by The Internet  Archive/Canadian Libraries)                  [Illustration]          HINTS ON THE USE AND HANDLING OF FIREARMS GENERALLY, AND THE REVOLVER IN  PARTICULAR.

HINTS ON THE USE AND HANDLING OF FIREARMS, _&c._ _&c._              'He, that rides at high speed, and with             His pistol kills a sparrow flying.'                                  SHAKESPEARE: _Henry IV._      THE National Rifle Association may fairly claim the honour of  introducing, at their meeting in July 1885, the subject of Military  Revolver practice in this country. For years past the want of such a  movement has been felt, but the many obstacles to be overcome have been  so vast that no one seems to have cared to venture upon the matter, and  so it has slept.    The great drawback has been, and is now, to find suitable ranges  anywhere near London. Such ranges, the use of which is enjoyed by our  Citizen Army, are insufficient, and the expense of keeping them up is  considerable, falling heavily upon the corps to whom they belong.    The National Rifle Association, although they offered some 40_l._ in  prizes, and provided not only revolvers but ammunition, for a small  consideration, or entrance fee, met with but poor support; but it should  be borne in mind that this was the first year of such a competition, and  it was in consequence not generally known of. Very little was known of  the movement till it actually took place, and then only when noticed by  the press the day after its introduction.    Again, it should be remembered that the entries were restricted to  officers, warrant officers, and petty officers, of her Majesty's land  and sea forces, and doubtless this restriction accounted for the spare  attendance. Every Englishman belonging to the auxiliary forces should  hail with pleasure the opportunity offered of making himself master of  this useful weapon; one that in skilled hands is most deadly at long or  short ranges, and a thorough knowledge of the use of which might at any  moment be the means of saving another's life from an opposing force when  no other weapon was at hand.    The difficulty in using even an ordinary pistol with accuracy is, and  always has been, an acknowledged fact, as it requires great practice to  enable a man to make his mark as a crack shot. Some men would perhaps  miss a haystack at twenty yards, while others, with little practice,  soon become excellent shots at very small objects. It is marvellous the  accuracy with which the professional burglar has of late years used his  revolver against the police and others; but it may be accounted for by  the fact that these men use a small, light weapon, easily carried and  much easier wielded than the military regulation revolver, which weighs  2 lbs. 8 oz.; that they invariably take what may be termed flying  shots--and it should be remembered that a full-sized man at  comparatively close quarters presents a very large target. I venture to  affirm that if these burglarious minions of the moon, who make night  hideous, were compelled to stand before a Martini-Smith target (a foot  square) at twenty yards, with a military regulation revolver, they would  make but sorry marksmen.    The use of the military revolver is acknowledged to be a question of  great importance, as one not only affecting those who embrace the  profession of arms, but those who travel; and as no one knows when he  may be called upon, or where he may be, it is imperative that he should  gain a thorough knowledge of every minor detail, most useful in the hour  of need, and which will enable him not only to protect himself with  confidence, but to come to the assistance of the weak should occasion  require.    It is to be deplored that what once formed part of the education of a  gentleman--_i.e._ the use of the small sword and broadsword--should have  been so thoroughly neglected of late years in this country. That part of  the education of youth seems to have become quite a secondary  consideration.    General Sir Charles Napier has truly said, 'Young men have all the  temptations in the world to pleasure, none to study; consequently, they  some day find themselves conspicuous for want of knowledge, not of  talent.'    The introduction of the Breech-loader has revolutionised firearms. When  we look back upon the extraordinary achievements of arms during the  present century, with the comparatively crude weapons then in use as  compared with the marvellous inventions of the present moment, it is  simply astounding what results were obtained.    The terrible work done by the old Brown Bess, with its unique  flint-and-steel lock of its day, at Waterloo and elsewhere, is now  matter of history. In those days artillery and cavalry had a chance of  existence in the field, they have scarcely any now. The old flint lock,  although it has had its day, has done its work well, and is entitled to  veneration. Many a noble fellow has bit the dust from its spark, and  England's first and greatest battles were fought and won by its aid. The  Nipple and Percussion Cap came next into use, and subsequently the  Breech-loader; but since Rifles have superseded military smooth-bore  weapons, the old spherical ball has been condemned.    The breech-loading rifled arm of the present day may be looked upon as a  marvel of modern ingenuity; as combining exquisite manufacture,  extraordinary precision, and unequalled range. The latter may be  accounted for by the conical shape of the bullet, and the rotary motion  given thereto by the grooving of the barrel; and lastly, from the full  force of the evolution of gas consequent upon the powder being enclosed  in a copper tube which is inserted in the breech when loading the piece.    The barrel of the Breech-loading Rifle is by its own action of firing  kept comparatively clean, as compared with the old Muzzle-loader; for  with the breech-loader any fouling of the barrel is driven out by the  discharge, and the powder in the cartridge is kept perfectly free from  any contamination with the moisture adhering to the barrel by its copper  case and being inserted in the breech; whereas in the old muzzle-loading  weapon the barrel, after the first discharge, becomes lubricated, and  consequently a portion of the powder poured down the barrel adhered to  its moist sides, thereby becoming deteriorated and decreasing the  explosive force. As a weapon of precision the Snider is perhaps  preferable to the Martini-Henry; but, of course, this is matter of  opinion.    The sportsman of the good old school would be somewhat astonished, and  would perhaps feel uncomfortable, upon finding himself armed with a  breech-loading fowling-piece of the present day, particularly as  prejudices are strong and obstinacy very prevalent among some people,  and the keen eye of the old sportsman would view the modern innovation  upon his rights--as he would probably call them--with dread, suspicion,  and distrust.    It is a fact, even at the present time, that there are many old farmers  in England who use their ancient flint-and-steel fowling-pieces from  choice in preference to modern weapons.    The cool old sportsman of days gone by would sally forth in quest of  game, having previously overhauled his lock, and, if necessary,  adjusted a new flint, with as much care as an angler would examine his  tackle previous to a day's sport, as he well knew that success depended  upon vigilance and care. There was no blustering and banging away in  those days, as soon as a bird rose, as is unhappily too often the case  now-a-days, resulting in either blowing the bird all to pieces or  probably missing it altogether. No, the keen eye of the old school would  coolly watch his bird rise, take a pinch of snuff, cock his piece, cover  his bird, and then bring it down, allowing it to get well away before  drawing the trigger.    Many a young gentleman calling himself a sportsman knows little of the  capabilities of the weapon he wields, and cares less; his whole aim is  to see how many head of game he can bag, and to blaze away is the order  of the day, to the astonishment of poor Ponto, who, if he chance to run  within range, sometimes gets a charge of shot in his tail.    In the Royal Navy the use and practice of the pistol, and latterly of  the revolver, has always been kept up. Consequently the Jack Tar knows  more about the pistol and the military revolver than most men give him  credit for. In boarding vessels, for instance, the pistol was one of the  arms used. The importance of the revolver movement as inaugurated by the  National Rifle Association has resulted in the formation of a club  called 'The Metropolitan Revolver Club.' This Club, which is in its  infancy, has many obstacles to surmount, but it is to be hoped that the  Provisional Committee will be able to carry out the object in view,  which is, according to the programme, as follows:--          'That this Club be formed, having for its object            the provision of facilities for acquiring a            thorough knowledge of and proficiency in the use            of the Military Revolver.'    DUDLEY WILSON, Esq., 2 Pall Mall, is the Honorary Secretary, and may  success attend him.    To the inexperienced, the revolver is, perhaps, as deadly a weapon as  can well be handled; and to no class is this fact so well known as to  naval and military men. The many deplorable accidents resulting from the  incautious handling of firearms is terrible to contemplate; and  sportsmen and military men have frequently fallen victims "]]]
