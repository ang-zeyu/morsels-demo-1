PREFACE.      In selecting the biography of another animal from the Archives of  Caneville, for the entertainment of a very different race, I thought I  could not do better than fix upon \"The Cat;\" and as the celebrated Miss  Minette Gattina, the historian of poor Job, had bequeathed some of her  own memoirs to her native City, furnished, too, with an Introduction by  herself, I at once seized upon the materials thus afforded me, and  converted them into their present form. I know not whether they will  enjoy the same favour which the Public has deigned to accord to the  veracious story of \"A Bear,\" or the simple \"Adventures of a Dog.\" Time  will show whether these true memoirs will be as attractive to youthful  readers as the other tales of the feline race, from time immemorial such  standard favourites; whether they will have even a chance of success,  after the story of that strong-minded Puss, who trod down the ignorant,  and made her own and master's fortune in a pair of top-boots; or that  other famous tabby,[1] so intimately associated with City annals and the  name of Whittington, whose powers of leading her proprietor to wealth  were no less remarkable.    I count as but of little moment the story of the \"White Cat;\" for though  it often charmed me in my days of romance, when the world seemed all  bright and beautiful, and the Golden Age appeared no marvel, I have been  since angry with myself at my admiration, as though charmed under false  pretences, seeing that the said \"White Cat\" was no Puss after all, but a  very free and easy young lady in disguise.    My Caneville Pussy is at least a true one. From the respect in which she  appears to have been held in her place of birth, and from the attention  which seems to have been bestowed upon her by most of the great animals  of Caneville, there is every reason to believe that the scenes she  describes were real; for it was a weakness of the Dons in that famous  City only to grant favour where it was merited, and never to associate  with those whose moral character was not above suspicion.    With these preliminary remarks, I leave Miss Minette to tell her own  story. That no one was more capable of doing so may be judged from the  fact that it was a customary thing with her to relate it to a crowd of  admiring listeners, whom the fame of her beauty, adventures, and with  attracted to her dwelling; and though the comments which were made and  the questions asked by one or other of the auditory, made the narration  on such occasions a rather lengthy one, the written memoirs, from which  this tale has been translated, may be considered the pith, the marrow,  as it were, of her \"household narrative.\"    A.

I was about to address my readers with the usual phrase, that \"at the  request of friends\" I had collected the scattered memorials of the chief  events of my life, and now presented them to the reading world, in the  hope that some lesson might be learnt from them, which could be useful  to the inexperienced when similarly situated. But I will be more candid,  and say rather, that \"to please myself\" I have put into a complete form  the recollections in question; not however without the wish that they  may prove of service to Cat, ay, and to Dog, and other kind. There never  was a life spent in this world but that its history could teach a  lesson; for, though every life has peculiarities of its own, and may be  varied in a thousand ways, the wishes, the resolutions of most of us do  not take a wide range, nor does it require a very extensive circle to  limit them all.    I would not however have my readers imagine that vanity alone has  induced me to record my experiences. No; I have had another, and  I think a higher motive. I wished to convey to the intelligence of all  animals capable of understanding the language of Caneville, some portions  of the history of a _real_ Cat; and, by so doing, try to remove from the  minds of many the opinion that she is a creature _ignorant of the finer  feelings, oblivious of gratitude_, incapable of strong attachments,  and so uncertain in her temper as to scratch and bite even, one minute,  the paw she has been licking and fondling the moment before. I wished to  prove that the same natural disposition holds good with our race as with  every other; that some of us are, from our birth, kind, rough, loveable,  cruel, tender-hearted, and ferocious, just as other beasts that wear a  tail or come into the world without one; and that this temperament may  be modified, and even changed, by education and treatment, precisely as  the dispositions of other animals.    It is a cruel wrong done to our race to exclaim, as many do, that \"Cats  have no attachments, no tenderness; that there is always a lurking  fierceness in their hearts, which makes them forget, with the first mark  of roughness or ill treatment, a thousand benefits which they may have  formerly received.\" I deny it wholly. I, a Cat, affirm that, with few  exceptions, there are no animals more loving or more tender. Look at  the care which a respectable married Puss bestows upon her numerous  offspring! Can any mamma more carefully wash or tend her darlings? Will  any show greater willingness to forego her own occupations, in order to  fondle and descend to be the playmate of her little ones? Does any  display a firmer courage to defend them? And if she should give way to  a little expression of feeling when her tail is trodden upon or pulled,  or be betrayed into an angry growl when her territory is invaded, what  then? You would not have her show so little spirit as to receive every  insult unnoticed, or return a quiet \"thank you\" for the pain, physical  or moral, which has been inflicted on her. How would _you_, dear reader,  act if _your_ tail were wantonly pulled, or if _your_ house were to be  entered by an ugly stranger without invitation?    We most of us laugh at our good friends the Sheep, and indulge in many  a sly joke at their stupidity. \"What can be more absurd,\" we say,  \"than that habit of theirs of constantly playing at 'follow my leader,'  and putting themselves into all sorts of disagreeable situations in  consequence?\" But are we any better ourselves? Are not _we_ always  following some leader?--always imitating somebody, and running in crowds  hither and thither because so-and-so are running there too? And thus  it is that _opinions_, once uttered by some great animal in authority,  are taken up and repeated by his imitators, and are looked on as the  very essence of wisdom, while they are often, in fact, no other, when  examined, than untrue or mischievously unjust. Such are the pet  sentences I have alluded to, wherein Cats are described: a whole race is  sometimes condemned because a few members of it have proved unworthy;  and a tribe gets a bad name because some animal of influence, a Jackass  perhaps, brays out that \"they are _all_ worthless.\"    It has been often observed, and I therefore do not profess to utter  an original idea by remarking it again, that when our prejudices are  enlisted in favour of or against any object, every circumstance is  turned to its advantage or the reverse. If we have done an animal a  kindness, we are ready to do him another; if we have inflicted on him  any injury, we are not at all indisposed to add a fresh one to it. And  so it has happened that our numerous family, having been by many ill  treated, are constantly exposed to kicks and insult from those same  parties, for no other reason than that they have kicked and insulted  us before. The meekness of our disposition has been distorted into  hypocrisy; our quiet has been called \"meditative treachery;\" and our  natural and innocent instincts have been styled \"the proofs of a  sanguinary temperament.\" Our every look has been perverted by our  enemies into a moral squint; and our simplest caress and naturally  fondling way have been set down as the strongest marks of a Jesuitical  heart. In fact, in the eyes of many, nothing we can do, no step we can  take, but is considered evidence of our wicked disposition; and we are  not unfrequently loaded with abuse for the very things for which beasts  that have a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32522"],[0,"Mr. Spaceship (#1)"],[1,"etext was produced from Imagination Stories of Science      and Fantasy January 1953.

A human brain-controlled spacecraft would mean mechanical      perfection. This was accomplished, and something unforeseen: a      strange entity called--          Mr. Spaceship      _By_      _Philip K. Dick_      [Illustration]    Kramer leaned back. \"You can see the situation. How can we deal with a  factor like this? The perfect variable.\"    \"Perfect? Prediction should still be possible. A living thing still  acts from necessity, the same as inanimate material. But the  cause-effect chain is more subtle; there are more factors to be  considered. The difference is quantitative, I think. The reaction of  the living organism parallels natural causation, but with greater  complexity.\"    Gross and Kramer looked up at the board plates, suspended on the wall,  still dripping, the images hardening into place. Kramer traced a line  with his pencil.    \"See that? It's a pseudopodium. They're alive, and so far, a weapon we  can't beat. No mechanical system can compete with that, simple or  intricate. We'll have to scrap the Johnson Control and find something  else.\"    \"Meanwhile the war continues as it is. Stalemate. Checkmate. They  can't get to us, and we can't get through their living minefield.\"    Kramer nodded. \"It's a perfect defense, for them. But there still  might be one answer.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"Wait a minute.\" Kramer turned to his rocket expert, sitting with the  charts and files. \"The heavy cruiser that returned this week. It  didn't actually touch, did it? It came close but there was no  contact.\"    \"Correct.\" The expert nodded. \"The mine was twenty miles off. The  cruiser was in space-drive, moving directly toward Proxima,  line-straight, using the Johnson Control, of course. It had deflected  a quarter of an hour earlier for reasons unknown. Later it resumed its  course. That was when they got it.\"    \"It shifted,\" Kramer said. \"But not enough. The mine was coming along  after it, trailing it. It's the same old story, but I wonder about the  contact.\"    \"Here's our theory,\" the expert said. \"We keep looking for contact, a  trigger in the pseudopodium. But more likely we're witnessing a  psychological phenomena, a decision without any physical correlative.  We're watching for something that isn't there. The mine _decides_ to  blow up. It sees our ship, approaches, and then decides.\"    \"Thanks.\" Kramer turned to Gross. \"Well, that confirms what I'm  saying. How can a ship guided by automatic relays escape a mine that  decides to explode? The whole theory of mine penetration is that you  must avoid tripping the trigger. But here the trigger is a state of  mind in a complicated, developed life-form.\"    \"The belt is fifty thousand miles deep,\" Gross added. \"It solves  another problem for them, repair and maintenance. The damn things  reproduce, fill up the spaces by spawning into them. I wonder what  they feed on?\"    \"Probably the remains of our first-line. The big cruisers must be a  delicacy. It's a game of wits, between a living creature and a ship  piloted by automatic relays. The ship always loses.\" Kramer opened a  folder. \"I'll tell you what I suggest.\"    \"Go on,\" Gross said. \"I've already heard ten solutions today. What's  yours?\"    \"Mine is very simple. These creatures are superior to any mechanical  system, but only because they're alive. Almost any other life-form  could compete with them, any higher life-form. If the yuks can put out  living mines to protect their planets, we ought to be able to harness  some of our own life-forms in a similar way. Let's make use of the  same weapon ourselves.\"    \"Which life-form do you propose to use?\"    \"I think the human brain is the most agile of known living forms. Do  you know of any better?\"    \"But no human being can withstand outspace travel. A human pilot would  be dead of heart failure long before the ship got anywhere near  Proxima.\"    \"But we don't need the whole body,\" Kramer said. \"We need only the  brain.\"    \"What?\"    \"The problem is to find a person of high intelligence who would  contribute, in the same manner that eyes and arms are volunteered.\"    \"But a brain....\"    \"Technically, it could be done. Brains have been transferred several  times, when body destruction made it necessary. Of course, to a  spaceship, to a heavy outspace cruiser, instead of an artificial body,  that's new.\"    The room was silent.    \"It's quite an idea,\" Gross said slowly. His heavy square face  twisted. \"But even supposing it might work, the big question is  _whose_ brain?\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was all very confusing, the reasons for the war, the nature of the  enemy. The Yucconae had been contacted on one of the outlying planets  of Proxima Centauri. At the approach of the Terran ship, a host of  dark slim pencils had lifted abruptly and shot off into the distance.  The first real encounter came between three of the yuk pencils and a  single exploration ship from Terra. No Terrans survived. After that it  was all out war, with no holds barred.    Both sides feverishly constructed defense rings around their systems.  Of the two, the Yucconae belt was the better. The ring around Proxima  was a living ring, superior to anything Terra could throw against it.  The standard equipment by which Terran ships were guided in outspace,  the Johnson Control, was not adequate. Something more was needed.  Automatic relays were not good enough.    --Not good at all, Kramer thought to himself, as he stood looking down  the hillside at the work going on below him. A warm wind blew along  the hill, rustling the weeds and grass. At the bottom, in the valley,  the mechanics had almost finished; the last elements of the reflex  system had been removed from the ship and crated up.    All that was needed now was the new core, the new central key that  would take the place of the mechanical system. A human brain, the  brain of an intelligent, wary human being. But would the human being  part with it? That was the problem.    Kramer turned. Two people were approaching him along the road, a man  and a woman. The man was Gross, expressionless, heavy-set, walking  with dignity. The woman was--He stared in surprise and growing  annoyance. It was Dolores, his wife. Since they'd separated he had  seen little of her....    \"Kramer,\" Gross said. \"Look who I ran into. Come back down with us.  We're going into town.\"    \"Hello, Phil,\" Dolores said. \"Well, aren't you glad to see me?\"    He nodded. \"How have you been? You're looking fine.\" She was still  pretty and slender in her uniform, the blue-grey of Internal Security,  Gross' organization.    \"Thanks.\" She smiled. \"You seem to be doing all right, too. Commander  Gross tells me that you're responsible for this project, Operation  Head, as they call it. Whose head have you decided on?\"    \"That's the problem.\" Kramer lit a cigarette. \"This ship is to be  equipped with a human brain instead of the Johnson system. We've  constructed special draining baths for the brain, electronic relays to  catch the impulses and magnify them, a continual feeding duct that  supplies the living cells with everything they need. But--\"    \"But we still haven't got the brain itself,\" Gross finished. They  began to walk back toward the car. \"If we can get that we'll be ready  for the tests.\"    \"Will the brain remain alive?\" Dolores asked. \"Is it actually going to  live as part of the ship?\"    \"It will be alive, but not conscious. Very little life is actually  conscious. Animals, trees, insects are quick in their responses, but  they aren't conscious. In this process of ours the individual  personality, the ego, will cease. We only need the response ability,  nothing more.\"    Dolores shuddered. \"How terrible!\"    \"In time of war everything must be tried,\" Kramer said absently. \"If  one life sacrificed will end the war it's worth it. This ship might  get through. A couple more like it and there wouldn't be any more  war.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They got into the car. As they drove down the road, Gross said, \"Have  you thought of anyone yet?\"    Kramer shook his head. \"That's out of my line.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I'm an engineer. It's not in my department.\"    \"But all this was your idea.\"    \"My work ends there.\"    Gross was staring at him oddly. Kramer shifted uneasily.    \"Then who is supposed to do it?\" Gross said. \"I can have my  organization prepare examinations of various kinds, to determine  fitness, that kind of thing--\"    \"Listen, Phil,\" Dolores said suddenly.    \"What?\"    She turned toward him. \"I have an idea. Do you remember that professor  we had in college. Michael Thomas?\"    Kramer nodded.    \"I wonder if he's still alive.\" Dolores frowned. \"If he is he must be  awfully old.\"    \"Why, Dolores?\" Gross asked.    \"Perhaps an old person who didn't have much time left, but whose mind  was still clear and sharp--\"    \"Professor Thomas.\" Kramer rubbed his jaw. \"He certainly was a wise  old duck. But could he still be alive? He must have been seventy,  then.\"    \"We could find that out,\" Gross said. \"I could make a routine check.\"    \"What do you think?\" Dolores said. \"If any human mind could outwit  those creatures--\"    \"I don't like the idea,\" Kramer said. In his mind an image had  appeared, the image of an old man sitting behind a desk, his bright  gentle eyes moving about the classroom. The old man leaning forward, a  thin hand raised--    \"Keep him out of this,\" Kramer said.    \"What's wrong?\" Gross looked at him curiously.    \"It's because _I_ suggested it,\" Dolores said.    \"No.\" Kramer shook his head. \"It's not that. I didn't expect anything  like this, somebody I knew, a man I studied under. I remember him very  clearly. He was a very distinct"]]]
