Vol. V.--NEW-YORK, MARCH 1, 1852--No. III.          [Illustration]    THE AZTECS AT THE SOCIETY LIBRARY.      For several weeks the attention of the curious has been more and more  attracted to a remarkable ethnological exhibition at the Society  Library. Two persons, scarcely larger than the fabled gentlemen of  Lilliput, (though one is twelve or thirteen and the other eighteen years  of age), of just and even elegant proportions, and physiognomies  striking and peculiar, but not deficient in intellect or refinement,  have been visited by throngs of idlers in quest of amusement,  wonder-seekers, and the profoundest inquirers into human history. Until  very recently, Mexico was properly described as _Terra Incognita_. The  remains of nations are there shrouded in oblivion, and cities, in their  time surpassing Tadmor and Thebes, untrodden except by the jaguar and  the ocelot. A few persons, indeed, attracted by uncertain rumors of  ancient grandeur in Palenque, have visited her temples and tombs--                           There to track      Fallen states and empires o'er a land      Which was the mightiest in her high command,      And is the loveliest--    but no one has been found to read the hieroglyphics of Tolteca, to  disclose the history of the dwellers in Anahuac, to make known the  annals of the rise and fall of Tlascala, Otumba, Copan, or Papantla. In  the great work of Lord Kingsborough are collected many important remains  of Mexican and Aztec art and learning; Mr. Prescott has combined with a  masterly hand the traditions of the country; and Mr. Stevens and Mr.  Squier have done much in the last few years to render us familiar with  the more accessible and probably most significant ruins which illustrate  the civilization of the race subdued by the Spaniards; but still Central  America is unexplored. In the second volume of the work of Mr. Stevens,  he mentions that a Roman Catholic priest of Santa Cruz del Quiche told  him marvellous stories of a \"large city, with turrets white and  glittering in the sun,\" beyond the Cordilleras, where a people still  existed in the condition of the subjects of Montezuma. He proceeds:         \"The interest awakened in us, was the most thrilling I ever       experienced. One look at that city, was worth ten years of an       every-day life. If he is right, a place is left where Indians       and a city exist, as Cortez and Alvarado found them; there are       living men who can solve the mystery that hangs over the ruined       cities of America; who can, perhaps, go to Copan and read the       inscription on its monuments. No subject more exciting and       attractive presents itself to any mind, and the deep impression       in my mind will never be effaced. Can it be true? Being now in       my sober senses, I do verily believe there is much ground to       suppose that what the Padre told us is authentic. That the       region referred to does not acknowledge the government of       Gautamala, and has never been explored, and that no white man       has ever pretended to have entered it; I am satisfied. From       other sources we heard that a large _ruined_ city was visible;       and we were told of another person who had climbed to the top       of the sierra, but on account of the dense clouds rising upon       it, he had not been able to see any thing. At all events, the       belief at the village of Chajul is general, and a curiosity is       aroused that burns to be satisfied. We had a craving desire to       reach the mysterious city. No man if so willing to peril his       life, could undertake the enterprise, with any hope of success,       without hovering for one or two years on the borders of the       country, studying the language and character of the adjoining       Indians, and making acquaintance with some of the natives. Five       hundred men could probably march directly to the city, and the       invasion would be more justifiable than any made by Spaniards;       but the government is too much occupied with its own wars, and       the knowledge could not be procured except at the price of       blood. Two young men of good constitution, and who could afford       to spend five years, might succeed. If the object of search       prove a phantom, in the wild scenes of a new and unexplored       country, there are other objects of interest; but, if real,       besides the glorious excitement of such a novelty, they will       have something to look back upon through life. As to the       dangers, they are always magnified, and, in general, peril is       discovered soon enough for escape. But, in all probability, if       any discovery is made, it will be made by the Padres. As for       ourselves, to attempt it alone, ignorant of the language, and       with the mozos who were a constant annoyance to us, was out of       the question. The most we thought of, was to climb to the top       of the sierra, thence to look down upon the mysterious city;       but we had difficulties enough in the road before us; it would       add ten days to a journey already almost appalling in the       perspective; for days the sierra might be covered with clouds;       in attempting too much, we might lose all; Palenque was our       great point, and we determined not to be diverted from the       course we had marked out.\"--_Vol. ii., p. 193-196._    Mr. Stevens appears to have had some confidence in the Padre's  statement, and expresses a belief that the race of the aboriginal  inhabitants of Central America is not extinct, but that, scattered  perhaps and retired, like our own Indians, into wildernesses which have  never been penetrated by white men--erecting buildings of \"lime and  stone,\" \"with ornaments of sculpture, and plastered,\" \"large courts,\"  and \"lofty towers, with high ranges of steps,\" and carving on tablets of  stone mysterious hieroglyphs, there are still in secluded cities  \"unconquered, unvisited, and unsought aborigines.\" It is stated in a  pamphlet before us, that such a city was discovered in 1849 by three  adventurous travellers, and that one of them succeeded in bringing to  New York two specimens of its diminutive and peculiar inhabitants--the  persons now being exhibited in Broadway. Of the credibility of this  account we express no opinion, but the \"Aztec Children\" have the  phrenological and general appearance of the ancient Mexican sculptures,  and may well be regarded for their probable origin, their physical  structure, or their mere appearance, as among the \"most wonderful  specimens of humanity.\" We assent to the following paragraph by Mr.  Horace Greeley, whose testimony agrees with the common impressions they  have produced:         \"I hate monstrosities, however remarkable, and am rather       repelled than attracted by the idea of their truthfulness.       Assuming that there is a propensity in human nature--an       'organ,' as the phrenologists would phrase it--that finds       gratification in the inspection and scrutiny of Joice Heths,       Woolly Horses, and six-legged Swine, I would rather have it       gratified by fabricated and factitious than by natural and       veritable productions, and would rather not share in the       process from which that gratification is extracted. There is a       superabundance of ugliness and deformity which one is obliged       to see, without running after and nosing any out. It was,       therefore, with some reluctance that I obeyed a polite       invitation to visit the Aztec children, and ratify or dispute       the commendations hitherto bestowed on them, in these columns       and elsewhere. I did not expect to find ogres nor any thing       hideous, but, among all similar exhibitions, remembering with       pleasure only Tom Thumb, I could not hope to find gratification       in the sight of two dwarf Indians. But I was disappointed.       These children are simply abridgements or pocket editions of       Humanity--bright-eyed, delicate-featured, olive-complexioned       little elves, with dark, straight, glossy hair,       well-proportioned heads, and animated, pleasing countenances.       That their ages are honestly given, and that the boy weighs       just about as many pounds as he is years old (twenty), while       the girl is about half his age and three pounds lighter, I see       no reason at all for doubting. That they are human beings,       though of a low grade morally and intellectually, as well as       diminutive physically, there can be no doubt; and they are not       freaks of Nature, but specimens of a dwindled, minnikin race,       who almost realize in bodily form our ideas of the 'brownies,'       'bogles,' and other fanciful creations of a more superstitious       age. Their heads, unlike those of dwarfs, are small and not       ill-looking, but with very low foreheads and a general       conformation strongly confirmatory of certain fundamental       assertions of Phrenology. Idiotic they are not; but their       intellect and language are those of children of three or four       years, to whom their gait also assimilates them; but they have       none of childhood's reserve or shyness, are inquisitive and       restless, and articulate with manifest efforts and difficulty.       To children of three to six or eight years, their incessant       pranks and gambols must be a source of intense and unfailing       delight. The story that they were procured from an unknown,       scarcely approachable Aboriginal City of Central America called       _Iximaya_, situated high among the mountains and rarely visited       by civilized man, may be true or false; but that they are       natives of that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31175"],[0,"A New Species of Frog (Genus Tomodactylus) from Western México (#1)"],[1,"OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS                        MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY                    Volume 15, No. 3, pp. 175-181, 1 fig.

BY                                ROBERT G. WEBB      Thirteen specimens of frogs collected in the summers of 1960 and 1961  in the Mexican states of Durango and Sinaloa represent a heretofore  unnamed species. The specimens have been deposited in the Museum of  Natural History of the University of Kansas (KU) and in the Museum of  Michigan State University (MSU). The species may be named and  described as follows:                        Tomodactylus saxatilis new species        _Holotype._--KU 63326 (Fig. 1); obtained eight miles west of      El Palmito, Sinaloa, approximately 6100 feet, on 23 June      1961; original field number, 2354 of Robert G. Webb.        _Paratypes._--A total of 12 specimens: KU 63327-33, same data      as holotype, 23-25 June 1961; MSU 4085-88, two miles north of      Pueblo Nuevo, Durango, approximately 6000 feet elevation, 24      July 1960; MSU 4089, one half mile west of Revolcaderos,      Durango, approximately 6600 feet, 29 July 1961.        _Diagnosis._--A species of _Tomodactylus_ possessing the      following combination of characters: (1) tips of two outer      fingers truncate, about twice width of narrowest part of      digit; (2) tympanum small, less than one half diameter of      eye; (3) ventral surfaces smooth; (4) contrasting marbled      pattern on back and top of head, and (5) venter whitish,      lacking dark marks.        _Description of holotype._--Adult male; snout-vent length,      31.5 (measurements are in millimeters and were taken by means      of dial calipers reading to one tenth of a millimeter); width      of head, 11.2; length of head, 10.3; horizontal diameter of      eye, 3.1, and of tympanum, 1.2; distance from eye to nostril,      3.8; internarial width, 2.9; interorbital width, 4.1; width      of eyelid, 2.5; lumbar gland (left side), 7.0 x 2.6; distance      from axilla to groin, 15.2; tibial length, 12.7; length of      foot, 13.1.        Head slightly wider than body; tip of snout rounded, slightly      truncate; canthus rounded; tympanum small, less than one half      diameter of eye; tympanum having posterior margin      ill-defined, separated from eye by distance about equal to      diameter of tympanum; diameter of eye slightly less than      distance from eye to nostril; width of eyelid about two      thirds interorbital width; paratoid gland indistinct; lumbar      glands high, separated from insertion of leg by about one      millimeter; back and sides of body having low, scarcely      elevated pustules; top of head, limbs and venter smooth; few      low, whitish pustules below and behind tympanum, and low on      sides of body; posterior surface of thighs and anal region      pustulate; one pair of whitish postanal spots; ventral disc      attached near insertion of legs, lacking conspicuous      transverse fold; skin loose on throat, chest and abdomen.        Digits not webbed; tips of two outer fingers truncate, having      terminal transverse grooves, about twice width of narrowest      part of digit; digits of first and second fingers slightly      expanded; fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3, first      only slightly shorter than second; three palmar tubercles;      inner palmar tubercle about one third size of large median      tubercle; outer tubercle about one tenth size of large median      tubercle; four supernumerary palmar tubercles; tips of toes      slightly wider than narrowest part of digits; toes from      shortest to longest, 1-2-5-3-4, second only slightly shorter      than fifth; inner metatarsal tubercle about four times size      of small outer metatarsal tubercle; supernumerary tubercles      on foot small; no tarsal fold; heels touching when tibiae      adpressed to thighs; tibiotarsal articulation reaching eye      when leg adpressed to side of body.        Contrasting marbled pattern on back and top of head;      contrasting, mostly barred, pattern on limbs; ventral      surfaces whitish, lacking dark marks, but having minute dark      peppering; marbling of dorsal surfaces blackish and whitish      in preservative.        Vomerine teeth lacking; internal choanae lateral, partly      concealed by maxillaries; tongue smooth, elongate, shallowly      notched distally, free for about half its length; vocal sac      median; internal vocal slits large and near angle of jaw.        _Variation._--Twelve males closely resemble the holotype. Two      specimens from Pueblo Nuevo are soft and not well preserved.      The ranges of variation (means in parentheses) for the 13      males comprising the type series are: snout-vent length,      25.5-31.5 (27.9); width of head, 9.7-11.2 (10.5); diameter of      eye, 2.9-3.6 (3.2); horizontal diameter of tympanum, 1.1-1.8      (1.4); length of tibia, 11.1-13.1 (12.1); length of foot,      11.0-13.1 (12.1).        The pale ground color of the marbled pattern in most      specimens is least extensive on the back and arms, but most      extensive on the legs. The lumbar glands are slightly      elevated and conspicuous, and in KU 63328 are extremely      protuberant, or (KU 63330) evident on left side but flattened      and indistinct on right side. The back is rough having low,      scarcely elevated pustules, but becomes less rough anteriorly      and most of the top of head is smooth. The three specimens      from Pueblo Nuevo, Durango, differ slightly from the other      specimens examined in lacking pairs of postanal white spots,      and in having smooth backs (slightly pustulate in MSU 4088).      The tibiotarsal articulation fails to reach the eye in KU      63330. The small inner palmar tubercle is continuous with the      large median tubercle on the right hand of KU 63330, and      lacking on both hands of KU 63329 and on the left hand of KU      63328. The tip of the tongue is entire in some specimens and      in others has an irregular margin.        _Coloration of living specimens._--Marbled pattern on back      and top of head of dark brown to blackish on yellowish-gold;      pattern slightly less contrasting on limbs than on back,      consisting of brown to grayish on pale yellow; side of head      and body grayish sometimes having pale yellow to whitish      spots; iris blackish having fine reticulation of yellowish to      greenish-gold; venter dirty white.    _Habitat._--The three records of occurrence for _Tomodactylus  saxatilis_ are in a mixed boreal-tropical habitat, which is  transitional between a pine-oak forest at higher elevations and a  tropical deciduous forest at lower elevations. The mixed  boreal-tropical habitat is most conspicuous at elevations between  approximately 7800 and 5500 feet on southerly exposed slopes of  barrancas and arroyos of the dissected plateau of the Sierra Madre  Occidental. The mixed boreal-tropical habitat occurs for approximately  30 miles along the paved highway (Mexican Highway 40) between Cd.  Durango, Durango, and Mazatlan, Sinaloa. The records of occurrence in  those states that are along this highway are separated by 14.5 miles  (_via_ road).        [Illustration: FIG. 1. _Tomodactylus saxatilis_ new species,      adult male, KU 63326, holotype (x 2), dorsal view.]    The terrain consists of occasional level areas, but is mostly of steep  hillsides. Dominant trees are large oaks and pines; a characteristic  pine is the sad or drooping-needle pine, locally called \"pino triste.\"  The vegetational cover is usually open, including grasses, small oaks  and pines, broad-leaved shrubs and herbs, prickly pears, magueys,  thorny acacias, bracken fern, and epiphytes in trees. Ferns occur in  moist protected places, and orchids are occasional, sometimes in  trees.    Outcrops of rock, boulder-strewn areas, and occasional rock slides  (talus) also characterize the terrain. _Tomodactylus saxatilis _seems  to be restricted to rocky habitats. The individuals collected were  detected when they called at night from within crevices of rocks or  from exposed perches on rocks and boulders; some calling frogs were  out of reach on steep rock walls. The call is a single, loud, high  peep.        _Comparisons._--Dixon (1957) recognized six species of      _Tomodactylus_ (_nitidus_, _dilatus_, _albolabris_,      _angustidigitorum_, _fuscus_ and _grandis_) in his revision      of the genus. Another species (_rufescens_) was subsequently      described by Duellman and Dixon (1959). _Tomodactylus      saxatilis_ differs from all the species named immediately      above by the combination of characters given in the      diagnosis. _Tomodactylus saxatilis_ differs from _nitidus_,      _angustidigitorum_ and _grandis_ in having the tips of the      two outer fingers widened and truncate;"]]]
