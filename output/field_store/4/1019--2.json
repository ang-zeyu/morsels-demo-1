The second volume, however,  will conclude the account of the ancient architecture of Venice. The  third will embrace the Early, the Roman, and the Grotesque Renaissance;  and an Index, which, as it gives, in alphabetical order, a brief account  of all the buildings in Venice, or references to the places where they  are mentioned in the text, will be found a convenient guide for the  traveller. In order to make it more serviceable, I have introduced some  notices of the pictures which I think most interesting in the various  churches, and in the Scuola di San Rocco.

FIRST, OR BYZANTINE, PERIOD.          CHAPTER I.    THE THRONE.      Sec. I. In the olden days of travelling, now to return no more, in which  distance could not be vanquished without toil, but in which that toil  was rewarded, partly by the power of deliberate survey of the countries  through which the journey lay, and partly by the happiness of the  evening hours, when, from the top of the last hill he had surmounted,  the traveller beheld the quiet village where he was to rest, scattered  among the meadows beside its valley stream; or, from the long-hoped-for  turn in the dusty perspective of the causeway, saw, for the first time,  the towers of some famed city, faint in the rays of sunset--hours of  peaceful and thoughtful pleasure, for which the rush of the arrival in  the railway station is perhaps not always, or to all men, an  equivalent,--in those days, I say, when there was something more to be  anticipated and remembered in the first aspect of each successive  halting-place, than a new arrangement of glass roofing and iron girder,  there were few moments of which the recollection was more fondly  cherished by the traveller than that which, as I endeavored to describe  in the close of the last chapter, brought him within sight of Venice, as  his gondola shot into the open lagoon from the canal of Mestre. Not but  that the aspect of the city itself was generally the source of some  slight disappointment, for, seen in this direction, its buildings are  far less characteristic than those of the other great towns of Italy;  but this inferiority was partly disguised by distance, and more than  atoned for by the strange rising of its walls and towers out of the  midst, as it seemed, of the deep sea, for it was impossible that the  mind or the eye could at once comprehend the shallowness of the vast  sheet of water which stretched away in leagues of rippling lustre to the  north and south, or trace the narrow line of islets bounding it to the  east. The salt breeze, the white moaning sea-birds, the masses of black  weed separating and disappearing gradually, in knots of heaving shoal,  under the advance of the steady tide, all proclaimed it to be indeed the  ocean on whose bosom the great city rested so calmly; not such blue,  soft, lake-like ocean as bathes the Neapolitan promontories, or sleeps  beneath the marble rocks of Genoa, but a sea with the bleak power of our  own northern waves, yet subdued into a strange spacious rest, and  changed from its angry pallor into a field of burnished gold, as the sun  declined behind the belfry tower of the lonely island church, fitly  named \"St. George of the Seaweed.\" As the boat drew nearer to the city,  the coast which the traveller had just left sank behind him into one  long, low, sad-colored line, tufted irregularly with brushwood and  willows: but, at what seemed its northern extremity, the hills of Arqua  rose in a dark cluster of purple pyramids, balanced on the bright mirage  of the lagoon; two or three smooth surges of inferior hill extended  themselves about their roots, and beyond these, beginning with the  craggy peaks above Vicenza, the chain of the Alps girded the whole  horizon to the north--a wall of jagged blue, here and there showing  through its clefts a wilderness of misty precipices, fading far back  into the recesses of Cadore, and itself rising and breaking away  eastward, where the sun struck opposite upon its snow, into mighty  fragments of peaked light, standing up behind the barred clouds of  evening, one after another, countless, the crown of the Adrian Sea,  until the eye turned back from pursuing them, to rest upon the nearer  burning of the campaniles of Murano, and on the great city, where it  magnified itself along the waves, as the quick silent pacing of the  gondola drew nearer and nearer. And at last, when its walls were  reached, and the outmost of its untrodden streets was entered, not  through towered gate or guarded rampart, but as a deep inlet between two  rocks of coral in the Indian sea; when first upon the traveller's sight  opened the long ranges of columned palaces,--each with its black boat  moored at the portal,--each with its image cast down, beneath its feet,  upon that green pavement which every breeze broke into new fantasies of  rich tessellation; when first, at the extremity of the bright vista, the  shadowy Rialto threw its colossal curve slowly forth from behind the  palace of the Camerlenghi; that strange curve, so delicate, so  adamantine, strong as a mountain cavern, graceful as a bow just bent;  when first, before its moonlike circumference was all risen, the  gondolier's cry, \"Ah! Stali,\"[1] struck sharp upon the ear, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations and also        the index for all three volumes of the set with links        to the other two volumes.

I trust that the reader has been enabled, by the preceding  chapters, to form some conception of the magnificence of the streets of  Venice during the course of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Yet  by all this magnificence she was not supremely distinguished above the  other cities of the middle ages. Her early edifices have been preserved  to our times by the circuit of her waves; while continual recurrences of  ruin have defaced the glory of her sister cities. But such fragments as  are still left in their lonely squares, and in the corners of their  streets, so far from being inferior to the buildings of Venice, are even  more rich, more finished, more admirable in invention, more exuberant in  beauty. And although, in the North of Europe, civilization was less  advanced, and the knowledge of the arts was more confined to the  ecclesiastical orders, so that, for domestic architecture, the period of  perfection must be there placed much later than in Italy, and considered  as extending to the middle of the fifteenth century; yet, as each city  reached a certain point in civilization, its streets became decorated  with the same magnificence, varied only in style according to the  materials at hand, and temper of the people. And I am not aware of any  town of wealth and importance in the middle ages, in which some proof  does not exist, that, at its period of greatest energy and prosperity,  its streets were inwrought with rich sculpture, and even (though in  this, as before noticed, Venice always stood supreme) glowing with color  and with gold. Now, therefore, let the reader,--forming for himself as  vivid and real a conception as he is able, either of a group of Venetian  palaces in the fourteenth century, or, if he likes better, of one of the  more fantastic but even richer street scenes of Rouen, Antwerp, Cologne,  or Nuremberg, and keeping this gorgeous image before him,--go out into  any thoroughfare, representative, in a general and characteristic way,  of the feeling for domestic architecture in modern times; let him, for  instance, if in London, walk once up and down Harley Street, or Baker  Street, or Gower Street; and then, looking upon this picture and on  this, set himself to consider (for this is to be the subject of our  following and final inquiry) what have been the causes which have  induced so vast a change in the European mind.    Sec. II. Renaissance architecture is the school which has conducted  men's inventive and constructive faculties from the Grand Canal to Gower  Street; from the marble shaft, and the lancet arch, and the wreathed  leafage, and the glowing and melting harmony of gold and azure, to the  square cavity in the brick wall. We have now to consider the causes and  the steps of this change; and, as we endeavored above to investigate the  nature of Gothic, here to investigate also the nature of Renaissance.    Sec. III. Although Renaissance architecture assumes very different  forms among different nations, it may be conveniently referred to three  heads:--Early Renaissance, consisting of the first corruptions  introduced into the Gothic schools: Central or Roman Renaissance, which  is the perfectly formed style: and Grotesque Renaissance, which is the  corruption of the Renaissance itself.    Sec. IV. Now, in order to do full justice to the adverse cause, we will  consider the abstract _nature_ of the school with reference only to its  best or central examples. The forms of building which must be classed  generally under the term _early_ Renaissance are, in many cases, only  the extravagances and corruptions of the languid Gothic, for whose  errors the classical principle is in no wise answerable. It was stated  in the second chapter of the \"Seven Lamps,\" that, unless luxury had  enervated and subtlety falsified the Gothic forms, Roman traditions  could not have prevailed against them; and, although these enervated and  false conditions are almost instantly colored by the classical  influence, it would be utterly unfair to lay to the charge of that  influence the first debasement of the earlier schools, which had lost  the strength of their system before they could be struck by the plague.    Sec. V. The manner, however, of the debasement of all schools of art, so  far as it is natural, is in all ages the same; luxuriance of ornament,  refinement of execution, and idle subtleties of fancy, taking the place  of true thought and firm handling: and I do not intend to delay the  reader long by the Gothic sick-bed, for our task is not so much to watch  the wasting of fever in the features of the expiring king, as to trace  the character of that Hazael who dipped the cloth in water, and laid it  upon his face, Nevertheless, it is necessary to the completeness of our  view of the architecture of Venice, as well as to our understanding of  the manner in which the Central Renaissance obtained its universal  dominion, that we glance briefly at the principal forms into which  Venetian Gothic first declined. They are two in number: one the  corruption of the Gothic itself; the other a partial return to Byzantine  forms; for the Venetian mind having carried the Gothic to a point at  which it was dissatisfied, tried to retrace its steps, fell back first  upon Byzantine types, and through them passed to the first Roman. But in  thus retracing its steps, it does not recover its own lost energy. It  revisits the places through which it had passed in the morning light,  but it is now with wearied limbs, and under the gloomy shadows of  evening.    Sec. VI. It has just been said that the two principal causes of natural  decline in any school, are over-luxuriance and over-refinement. The  corrupt Gothic of Venice furnishes us with a curious instance of the  one, and the corrupt Byzantine of the other. We shall examine them in  succession.    Now, observe, first, I do not mean by _luxuriance_ of ornament,  _quantity_ of ornament. In the best Gothic in the world there is hardly  an inch of stone left unsculptured. But I mean that character of  extravagance in the ornament itself which shows that it was addressed to  jaded faculties; a violence and coarseness in curvature, a depth of  shadow,"]]]
