INDEX, 243          NOTE ON THE ILLUSTRATIONS      The original drawings, made especially for this book, are by Charles R.  Knight and James M. Gleeson, under the direction of Mr. Knight. The fact  that the originals of these drawings have been presented to and accepted  by the United States National Museum is evidence of their scientific  value. Mr. Knight has been commissioned by the Smithsonian Institution,  the United States National Museum, and the New York Museum of Natural  History, to do their most important pictures of extinct animals. He is  the one modern artist who can picture prehistoric animals with artistic  charm of presentation as well as with full scientific accuracy. In this  instance, the author has personally superintended the artist's work, so  that it is as correct in every respect as present knowledge makes  possible. Of the minor illustrations, some are by Mr. Bruce Horsfall, an  artist attached to the staff of the New York Museum of Natural History,  and all have been drawn with the help of and under the author's  supervision.

Nature's Four Methods of Making a Wing: Bat, Pteryodactyl,      Archaeopteryx, and Modern Bird        "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3803"],[0,"File No. 113 (#1)"],[1,"NO. 113    By Emile Gaboriau          I    In the Paris evening papers of Tuesday, February 28, 1866, under the  head of _Local Items_, the following announcement appeared:      \"A daring robbery, committed against one of our most eminent bankers,  M. Andre Fauvel, caused great excitement this morning throughout the  neighborhood of Rue de Provence.    \"The thieves, who were as skilful as they were bold, succeeded in  making an entrance to the bank, in forcing the lock of a safe that has  heretofore been considered impregnable, and in possessing themselves  of the enormous sum of three hundred and fifty thousand francs in  bank-notes.    \"The police, immediately informed of the robbery, displayed their  accustomed zeal, and their efforts have been crowned with success.  Already, it is said, P. B., a clerk in the bank, has been arrested,  and there is every reason to hope that his accomplices will be speedily  overtaken by the hand of justice.\"      For four days this robbery was the town talk of Paris.    Then public attention was absorbed by later and equally interesting  events: an acrobat broke his leg at the circus; an actress made her  debut at a small theatre: and the _item_ of the 28th was soon forgotten.    But for once the newspapers were--perhaps intentionally--wrong, or at  least inaccurate in their information.    The sum of three hundred and fifty thousand francs certainly had been  stolen from M. Andre Fauvel's bank, but not in the manner described.    A clerk had also been arrested on suspicion, but no decisive proof had  been found against him. This robbery of unusual importance remained, if  not inexplicable, at least unexplained.    The following are the facts as they were related with scrupulous  exactness at the preliminary examination.          II    The banking-house of Andre Fauvel, No. 87 Rue de Provence, is an  important establishment, and, owing to its large force of clerks,  presents very much the appearance of a government department.    On the ground-floor are the offices, with windows opening on the street,  fortified by strong iron bars sufficiently large and close together to  discourage all burglarious attempts.    A large glass door opens into a spacious vestibule where three or four  office-boys are always in waiting.    On the right are the rooms to which the public is admitted, and from  which a narrow passage leads to the principal cash-room.    The offices of the corresponding clerk, book-keeper, and general  accounts are on the left.    At the farther end is a small court on which open seven or eight little  wicket doors. These are kept closed, except on certain days when notes  are due; and then they are indispensable.    M. Fauvel's private office is on the first floor over the offices, and  leads into his elegant private apartments.    This private office communicates directly with the bank by means of  a narrow staircase, which opens into the room occupied by the head  cashier.    This room, which in the bank goes by the name of the \"cash-office,\" is  proof against all attacks, no matter how skilfully planned; indeed, it  could almost withstand a regular siege, sheeted as it is like a monitor.    The doors, and the partition where the wicket door is cut, are covered  with thick sheets of iron; and a heavy grating protects the fireplace.    Fastened in the wall by enormous iron clamps is a safe, a formidable  and fantastic piece of furniture, calculated to fill with envy the poor  devil who easily carries his fortune in a pocket-book.    This safe, which is considered the masterpiece of the firm of Becquet,  is six feet in height and four and a half in width, made entirely of  wrought iron, with triple sides, and divided into isolated compartments  in case of fire.    The safe is opened by an odd little key, which is, however, the least  important part of the mechanism. Five movable steel buttons, upon which  are engraved all the letters of the alphabet, constitute the real power  of this ingenious safe.    Before inserting the key into the lock, the letters on the buttons must  be in the exact position in which they were placed when the safe was  locked.    In M. Fauvel's bank, as everywhere, the safe was always closed with a  word that was changed from time to time.    This word was known only to the head of the bank and the cashier, each  of whom had also a key to the safe.    In a fortress like this, a person could deposit more diamonds than the  Duke of Brunswick's, and sleep well assured of their safety.    But one danger seemed to threaten, that of forgetting the secret word  which was the \"Open sesame\" of the safe.    On the morning of the 28th of February, the bank-clerks were all busy  at their various desks, about half-past nine o'clock, when a middle-aged  man of dark complexion and military air, clad in deep mourning, appeared  in the office adjoining the \"safe,\" and announced to the five or six  employees present his desire to see the cashier.    He was told that the cashier had not yet come, and his attention was  called to a placard in the entry, which stated that the \"cash-room\" was  opened at ten o'clock.    This reply seemed to disconcert and annoy the newcomer.    \"I expected,\" he said, in a tone of cool impertinence, \"to find someone  here ready to attend to my business. I explained the matter to M. Fauvel  yesterday. I am Count Louis de Clameran, an iron-manufacturer at Oloron,  and have come to draw three hundred thousand francs deposited in this  bank by my late brother, whose heir I am. It is surprising that no  direction was given about it.\"    Neither the title of the noble manufacturer, nor his explanations,  appeared to have the slightest effect upon the clerks.    \"The cashier has not yet arrived,\" they repeated, \"and we can do nothing  for you.\"    \"Then conduct me to M. Fauvel.\"    There was a moment's hesitation; then a clerk named Cavaillon, who was  writing near a window, said:    \"The chief is always out at this hour.\"    \"Then I will call again,\" replied M. de Clameran.    And he walked out, as he had entered, without saying \"Good-morning,\" or  even touching his hat.    \"Not very polite, that customer,\" said little Cavaillon, \"but he will  soon be settled, for here comes Prosper.\"    Prosper Bertomy, head cashier of Fauvel's banking-house, was a tall,  handsome man, of about thirty, with fair hair and large dark-blue eyes,  fastidiously neat, and dressed in the height of fashion.    He would have been very prepossessing but for a cold, reserved  English-like manner, and a certain air of self-sufficiency which spoiled  his naturally bright, open countenance.    \"Ah, here you are!\" cried Cavaillon, \"someone has just been asking for  you.\"    \"Who? An iron-manufacturer, was it not?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"Well, he will come back again. Knowing that I would get here late this  morning, I made all my arrangements yesterday.\"    Prosper had unlocked his office-door, and, as he finished speaking,  entered, and closed it behind him.    \"Good!\" exclaimed one of the clerks, \"there is a man who never lets  anything disturb him. The chief has quarrelled with him twenty times for  always coming too late, and his remonstrances have no more effect upon  him than a breath of wind.\"    \"And very right, too; he knows he can get anything he wants out of the  chief.\"    \"Besides, how could he come any sooner? a man who sits up all night, and  leads a fast life, doesn't feel like going to work early in the morning.  Did you notice how very pale he looked when he came in?\"    \"He must have been playing heavily again. Couturier says he lost fifteen  thousand francs at a sitting last week.\"    \"His work is none the worse done for all that,\" interrupted Cavaillon.  \"If you were in his place--\"    He stopped short. The cash-room door suddenly opened, and the cashier  appeared before them with tottering step, and a wild, haggard look on  his ashy face.    \"Robbed!\" he gasped out: \"I have been robbed!\"    Prosper's horrified expression, his hollow voice and trembling limbs,  betrayed such fearful suffering that the clerks jumped up from their  desks, and ran toward him. He almost dropped into their arms; he was  sick and faint, and fell into a chair.    His companions surrounded him, and begged him to explain himself.    \"Robbed?\" they said; \"where, how, by whom?\"    Gradually, Prosper recovered himself.    \"All the money I had in the safe,\" he said, \"has been stolen.\"    \"All?\"    \"Yes, all; three packages, each containing one hundred notes of a  thousand francs, and one package of fifty thousand. The four packages  were wrapped in a sheet of paper, and tied together.\"    With the rapidity of lightning, the news of the robbery spread  throughout the banking-house, and the room was soon filled with curious  listeners.    \"Tell us, Prosper,\" said young Cavaillon, \"did you find the safe broken  open?\"    \"No; it is just as I left it.\"    \"Well then, how, why----\"    \"Yesterday I put three hundred and fifty thousand francs in the safe;  and this morning they are gone.\"    All were silent except one old clerk, who did not seem to share the  general consternation.    \"Don't distress yourself, M. Bertomy,\" he said: \"perhaps the chief  disposed of the money.\"    The unhappy cashier started up with a look of relief; he eagerly caught  at the idea.    \"Yes!\" he exclaimed, \"you are right: the chief must have taken it.\"    But, after thinking a few minutes, he said in a tone of deep  discouragement:    \"No, that is impossible. During the five years that I have had charge of  the safe, M. Fauvel has never opened it except in my presence. Several  times he has needed money, and has either waited until I came, or sent  for me, rather than touch it in my absence.\"    \"Well,\" said Cavaillon, \"before despairing, let us ascertain.\"    But a messenger had already informed M. Fauvel of the disaster.    As Cavaillon was about to go in quest of him, he entered the room.    M."]]]
