LEGLER      In September, 1958, the author and two colleagues collected a large  series of _Pseudemys_ in small ponds and in a river in the basin of  Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila. The specimens prove to represent a  previously unrecognized subspecies of _Pseudemys scripta_. The  subspecies is named in honor of Edward Harrison Taylor who has  contributed more than any other person to our present knowledge of  the herpetofauna of Mexico.                    =Pseudemys scripta taylori= new subspecies                          (Pls. 9-12, Figures 1 & 2)    _Holotype._--Univ.

S Cuatro Cienegas, 9 September 1958; UU 3415  (female), 8.5 mi. SW Cuatro Cienegas, 1 August 1959.    _Diagnosis._--A subspecies of _Pseudemys scripta_ most closely  resembling _P. s. elegans_, but differing from that subspecies in  having: 1) extensive _black_ plastral pattern, all parts of which are  interconnected, covering approximately half of plastron; 2) tendency  toward melanism, in large adults of both sexes, especially noticeable  on posterior part of plastron; 3) cutting edge of lower jaw coarsely  serrate; 4) tendency for femoral edges of plastron to be reflected  ventrally, especially in males; and, 5) pectoral scute longer than  gular.    _Description of holotype_ (measurements given in Table 1).--Carapace  oval in dorsal aspect, slightly narrowed behind, nearly straight  across anterior margin, bluntly serrate behind; shell deep, highly  arched in cross section; height of shell 53 per cent of width; surface  of shell having longitudinal striations; middorsal keel weakly  developed, scarcely discernible except on third central lamina;  lateral margin of carapace not at all reflected, posterolateral  margins flared outward; central laminae all broader than long, the  first urn-shaped.

Ground color of plastron pale yellow, anterior half extensively marked  with black along laminal seams; all plastral markings interconnected;  undersurfaces of marginals on anterior half of shell having pale  centers; undersurfaces of posterior marginals and posterior half of  plastron solid black.    Plastron more or less evenly rounded in front, slightly indented on  gular border; posterolateral free edge of plastron reflected slightly  downward; posterior border of plastron having wide shallow anal notch;  plastral laminae, in order of length--abdominal, anal, pectoral,  gular, femoral, humeral; abdominal lamina longer than combined lengths  of pectoral and humeral or humeral and gular.    Head moderately wide; snout slightly pointed in dorsal view, curving  evenly backward and downward from nostrils in profile; upper jaw  notched in middle, cutting edges finely and unevenly serrate, crushing  surfaces having distinct ridge bearing fine denticulations but no  large teeth; cutting edges of lower jaw coarsely and evenly serrate,  tooth at symphysis relatively large; raised ridges of lower crushing  surfaces each having low blunt tooth and many fine denticulations.    Major markings of head and neck as follows: narrow stripe beginning  at posterior edge of eye and extending downward and backward (across  tympanum) on side of neck to shoulder (stripe wider behind than at  origin); wide stripe from lower posterior corner of eye extending  downward, across mandibular articulation (and below tympanum) on  throat to shoulder (wider at origin than behind); postorbital mark,  four to five millimeters wide, approximately 26 millimeters long,  connected to eye by narrow isthmus anteriorly and continuous with  narrow stripe on upper part of neck posteriorly; stripe on mandibular  symphysis widened and bifurcated posteriorly, its two branches  enclosing one wide and two narrow stripes; wide stripe beginning  in middle of mandibular ramus and running backward to point below  mandibular articulation on each side; top of head, sides of snout, and  areas between above-mentioned major stripes, marked with numerous,  fine, often indistinct pale lines.    Pale dorsal stripe on fleshy portion of each finger, those of second  and fourth fingers continuous to mid-humeral region, those of other  fingers broken on anterior face of antebrachium; upper and lower pale  stripes of antebrachium joined in mid-humeral region.    _Coloration of living specimens._--Ground color of soft parts dark  olive to slate gray or black; ground color of carapace olive to  slate gray; ground color of plastron pale yellow, markings blackish,  tinged with brown in younger specimens, sooty black in most adults.  Postorbital mark red; other markings on soft parts cream to buffy  yellow.    _Geographic range._--_Pseudemys scripta taylori_ is known only from  ponds, and the Rio Chiquito in the basin of Cuatro Cienegas. The  discovery of _taylori_ brings to six the number of valid subspecies  of _scripta_ known in Mexico (_elegans_, _gaigeae_, _hiltoni_,  _nebulosa_, _ornata_, and _taylori_) and to three (_elegans_,  _gaigeae_, and _taylori_) the number known in Coahuila. My own  studies of these six subspecies indicate that they are, beyond  reasonable doubt, members of a single polytypic species (_scripta_).  I tentatively follow Williams (1956:153) in rejecting \"_cataspila_\"  as an invalid name.    Three specimens of _Pseudemys scripta_ obtained by Robert G. Webb in  the Rio Chiquito at a point 8 mi. W of Nadadores, 2100 ft., where the  river flows out of the basin of Cuatro Cienegas, have many  characteristics in common with _taylori_, but resemble _elegans_  closely in several characters as follows: no extensive melanism;  plastral markings tending to be brownish; anterior plastral markings  smudgelike, isolated or nearly isolated; markings on lateral scutes  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31583"],[0,"The Venus Trap (#1)"],[1,"Venus Trap    By EVELYN E. SMITH    Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS    Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction  June 1956. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.         One thing Man never counted on to take along into space with       him was the Eternal Triangle--especially a true-blue       triangle like this!      \"What's the matter, darling?\" James asked anxiously. \"Don't you like the  planet?\"    \"Oh, I love the planet,\" Phyllis said. \"It's beautiful.\"    It was. The blue--really blue--grass, blue-violet shrubbery and,  loveliest of all, the great golden tree with sapphire leaves and pale  pink blossoms, instead of looking alien, resembled nothing so much as a  fairy-tale version of Earth.    Even the fragrance that filled the atmosphere was completely delightful  to Terrestrial nostrils--which was unusual, for most other planets, no  matter how well adapted for colonization otherwise, tended, from the  human viewpoint, anyway, to stink. Not that they were not colonized  nevertheless, for the population of Earth was expanding at too great a  rate to permit merely olfactory considerations to rule out an otherwise  suitable planet. This particular group of settlers had been lucky,  indeed, to have drawn a planet as pleasing to the nose as to the  eye--and, moreover, free from hostile aborigines.    [Illustration]    As a matter of fact, the only apparent evidence of animate life were the  small, bright-hued creatures winging back and forth through the clear  air, and which resembled Terrestrial birds so closely that there had  seemed no point to giving them any other name. There were insects, too,  although not immediately perceptible--but the ones like bees were devoid  of stings and the butterflies never had to pass through the grub stage  but were born in the fullness of their beauty.    However, fairest of all the creatures on the planet to James Haut--just  then, anyhow--was his wife, and the expression on her face was not a  lovely one.    \"You do feel all right, don't you?\" he asked. \"The light gravity gets  some people at first.\"    \"Yes, I guess I'm all right. I'm still a little shaken, though, and you  know it's not the gravity.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He would have liked to take her in his arms and say something  comforting, reassuring, but the constraint between them had not yet been  worn off. Although he had sent her an ethergram nearly every day of the  voyage, the necessarily public nature of the messages had kept them from  achieving communication in the deeper sense of the word.    \"Well, I suppose you did have a bit of a shock,\" he said lamely.  \"Somehow, I thought I had told you in my 'grams.\"    \"You told me plenty in the 'grams, but not quite enough, it seems.\"    Her words didn't seem to make sense; the strain had evidently been a  little too much. \"Maybe you ought to go inside and lie down for a  while.\"    \"I will, just as soon as I feel less wobbly.\" She brushed back the long,  light brown hair which had got tumbled when she fainted. He remembered a  golden rather than a reddish tinge in it, but that had been under the  yellow sun of Earth; under the scarlet sun of this planet, it took on a  different beauty.    \"How come the preliminary team didn't include--_it_ in their report?\"  she asked, avoiding his appreciative eye.    \"They didn't know. We didn't find out ourselves until we'd sent that  first message to Earth. I suppose by the time we did relay the news, you  were on your way.\"    \"Yes, that must have been it.\"    The preliminary exploration team had established the fact that the  planet was more or less Earth-type, that its air was breathable, its  temperature agreeably springlike, its mineral composition very similar  to Earth's, with only slight traces of unknown elements, that there was  plenty of drinkable water and no threatening life-forms. Human beings  could, therefore, live on it.    It remained for the scout team to determine whether human beings would  _want_ to live on it--whether, in fact, they themselves would want to,  because, if so, they had the option of becoming the first settlers. That  was the way the system worked and, in the main, it worked well enough.    After less than two weeks, this scout team had beamed back to Earth the  message that the planet was suitable for colonization, so suitable that  they would like to give it the name of Elysium, if there was no  objection.    There would be none, Earth had replied, so long as the pioneers bore in  mind the fact that six other planets had previously been given that  name, and a human colony currently existed on only one of those. No need  to worry about a conflict of nomenclature, however, because the name of  that other planet Elysium had subsequently been changed by unanimous  vote of settlers to Hades.           *       *       *       *       *    After this somewhat sinister piece of information, Earth had added the  more cheerful news that the wives and families of the scouts would soon  be on their way, bringing with them the tools and implements necessary  to transform the wilderness of the frontier into another Earth. In the  meantime, the men were to set up the packaged buildings with which all  scout ships were equipped, so that when the women came, homes would be  ready for them.    The men set to work and, before the month was out, they discovered that  Elysium was neither a wilderness nor a frontier. It was populated by an  intelligent race which had developed its culture to the limit of its  physical abilities--actually well beyond the limit of what the astounded  Terrestrials could have conceived its physical abilities to be--then,  owing to unavoidable disaster, had started to die out.    The remaining natives were perspicacious enough to see in the  Terrestrials' coming not a threat but a last hope of revivifying their  own moribund species. Accordingly, the Earthmen were encouraged to go  ahead building on the sites originally selected, the only ban being on  the type of construction materials used--and a perfectly reasonable one  under the circumstances.    James had built his cottage near the largest, handsomest tree in the  area allotted to him; since there were no hostile life-forms, there was  no need for a closely knit community. Everyone who had seen it agreed  that his house was the most attractive one of all, for, although it was  only a standard prefab, he had used taste and ingenuity to make it a  little different from the other unimaginative homes.    And now Phyllis, for whom he had performed all this labor of love, for  whom he had waited five long months--the tedium of which had been broken  only by the intellectual pleasure of teaching English to a sympathetic  native neighbor--Phyllis seemed unappreciative. She had hardly looked at  the inside of the cottage, when he had shown her through, and now was  staring at the outside in a blank sort of way.    The indoctrination courses had not, he reflected, reconciled her to the  frontiersman's necessarily simple mode of living--which was ironic,  considering that one of her original attractions for him had been her  apparent suitability for the pioneer life. She was a big girl, radiantly  healthy, even though a little green at the moment.           *       *       *       *       *    He just managed to keep his voice steady. \"You don't like the house--is  that it?    \"But I _do_ like it. Honestly I do.\" She touched his arm diffidently.  \"Everything would be perfect if only--\"    \"If only what? Is it the curtains? I'm sorry if you don't like them. I  brought them all the way from Earth in case the planet turned out to be  habitable. I thought blue was your favorite color.\"    \"Oh, it is, it is! I'm mad about the curtains.\"    Perhaps it wasn't the house that disappointed her; perhaps it was he  himself who hadn't lived up to dim memory and ardent expectation.    \"If you want to know what _is_ bothering me--\" she glanced up  apprehensively, lowering her voice as she did--\"it's that tree. It's  stuck on you; I just know it is.\"    He laughed. \"Now where did you get a preposterous idea like that, Phyl?  You've been on the planet exactly twenty-four hours and--\"    \"--and I have, in my luggage, one hundred and thirty-two ethergrams  talking about practically nothing but Magnolia this, Magnolia that. Oh,  I had my suspicions even before I landed, James. The only thing I didn't  suspect was that she was a _tree_!\"    \"What are you talking about, honey? Magnolia and I--we're just friends.\"    \"Purely a platonic relationship, I assure you,\" the tree herself agreed.  It would have been silly for her to pretend not to have overheard, since  the two were still standing almost directly underneath her. \"Purely  platonic.\"    \"She's more like a sister to me,\" James tried to explain.           *       *       *       *       *    Phyllis stiffened. \"Frankly, if I had imagined I was going to have a  tree for a sister-in-law, I would have thought before I married you,  James.\" Bursting into tears, she ran inside the cottage.    \"Sorry,\" he said miserably to Magnolia. \"It's a long trip out from Earth  and an uncomfortable one. I don't suppose the other women were  especially nice to her, either. Faculty wives mostly and you know how  they are.... No, I don't suppose you would. But she shouldn't have acted  that way toward you.\"    \"Not your fault,\" Magnolia told him, sighing with such intensity that he  could feel the humidity rise. \"I know how you've been looking forward to  her arrival. Rather a letdown, isn't it?\"    \"Oh, I'm sure it'll be all right.\" He tried to sound confident. \"And I  know you'll like Phyllis when you get to know her.\"    \"Possibly, but so far I'm afraid I must admit--since there never has  been any pretense between us--that she is a bit of a disappointment.  I--and my sisters also--had"]]]
