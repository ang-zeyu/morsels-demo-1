SOMETHING WRONG.      It was a May morning in Glenville. Pretty, picturesque Glenville, low  lying by the lake shore, with the waters of the lake surging to meet it,  or coyly receding from it, on the one side, and the green-clad hills  rising gradually and gently on the other, ending in a belt of trees at  the very horizon's edge.    There is little movement in the quiet streets of the town at half-past  eight o'clock in the morning, save for the youngsters who, walking,  running, leaping, sauntering or waiting idly, one for another, are, or  should be, on their way to the school-house which stands upon the very  southernmost outskirts of the town, and a little way up the hilly  slope, at a reasonably safe remove from the willow-fringed lake shore.    The Glenville school-house was one of the earliest public buildings  erected in the village, and it had been \"located\" in what was  confidently expected to be the centre of the place. But the new and  late-coming impetus, which had changed the hamlet of half a hundred  dwellings to one of twenty times that number, and made of it a quiet and  not too fashionable little summer resort, had carried the business of  the place northward, and its residences still farther north, thus  leaving this seat of learning aloof from, and quite above the newer  town, in isolated and lofty dignity, surrounded by trees; in the  outskirts, in fact, of a second belt of wood, which girdled the lake  shore, even as the further and loftier fringe of timber outlined the  hilltops at the edge of the eastern horizon and far away.    \"Les call 'er the 'cademy?\" suggested Elias Robbins, one of the builders  of the school-house, and an early settler of Glenville. \"What's to  hinder?\"    \"Nothin',\" declared John Rote, the village oracle. \"'Twill sound  first-rate.\"    They were standing outside the building, just completed and resplendent  in two coats of yellow paint, and they were just from the labour of  putting in, \"hangin'\" the new bell.    All of masculine Glenville was present, and the other sex was not  without representation.    \"Suits me down ter the ground!\" commented a third citizen; and no doubt  it would have suited the majority, but when Parson Ryder was consulted,  he smiled genially and shook his head.    \"It won't do, I'm afraid, Elias,\" he said. \"We're only a village as yet,  you see, and we can't even dub it the High School, except from a  geographical point of view. However, we are bound to grow, and our  titles will come with the growth.\"    The growth, after a time, began; but it was only a summer growth; and  the school-house was still a village school-house with its master and  one under, or primary, teacher; and to-day there was a frisking group of  the smaller youngsters rushing about the school-yard, while the first  bell rang out, and half a dozen of the older pupils clustered about the  girlish under-teacher full of questions and wonder; for Johnny Robbins,  whose turn it was to ring the bell this week, after watching the clock,  and the path up the hill, alternately, until the time for the first bell  had come, and was actually twenty seconds past, had reluctantly but  firmly seized the rope and began to pull.    \"'Taint no use, Miss Grant; I'll have to do it. He told me not to wait  for nothin', never, when 'twas half-past eight, and so\"--cling, clang,  cling--\"I'm bound\"--cling--\"ter do it!\" Clang. \"You see\"--cling--\"even  if he aint here----\" Clang, clang, clang.    The boy pulled lustily at the rope for about half as long as usual, and  then he stopped.    \"You don't s'pose that clock c'ud be wrong, do yo', Miss Grant? Mr.  Brierly's never been later'n quarter past before.\"    Miss Grant turned her wistful and somewhat anxious eyes toward the  eastern horizon, and rested a hand upon the shoulder of a tall girl at  her side.    \"He may be ill, Johnny,\" she said, reluctantly, \"or his watch may be  wrong. He's sure to come in time for morning song service. Come, Meta,  let us go in and look at those fractions.\"    Five--ten--fifteen minutes passed and the two heads bent still over book  and slate. Twenty minutes, and Johnny's head appeared at the door, half  a dozen others behind it.    \"Has he come, Johnny?\"    \"No'm; sha'n't I go an' see----\"    But Miss Grant arose, stopping him with a gesture. \"He would laugh at  us, Johnny.\" Then, with another look at the anxious faces, \"wait until  nine o'clock, at least.\"    Johnny and his followers went sullenly back to the porch, and Meta's lip  began to quiver.    \"Somethin's happened to him, Miss Grant,\" she whimpered; \"I know  somethin' has happened!\"    \"Nonsense,\" said Miss Grant. But she went to the window and called to a  little girl at play upon the green.    \"Nellie Fry! Come here, dear.\"    Nellie Fry, an a, b, c student, came running in, her yellow locks flying  straight out behind her.    \"What is it, Miss Grant?\"    \"Nellie, did you see Mr. Brierly at breakfast?\"    \"Yes'm!\"    \"And--quite well?\"    \"Why--I guess so. He talked just like he does always, and asked the  blessin'. He--he ate a lot, too--for him. I 'member ma speakin' of it.\"    \"You remember, Nellie.\"    Miss Grant kissed the child and walked to her desk, bending over her  roll call, and seeming busy over it until the clock upon the opposite  wall struck the hour of nine, and Johnny's face appeared at the door,  simultaneously with the last stroke.    \"Sh'll I ring, Miss Grant?\"    \"Yes.\" The girl spoke with sudden decision. \"Ring the bell, and then go  at once to Mrs. Fry's house, and ask if anything has happened to detain  Mr. Brierly. Don't loiter, Johnny.\"    There was an unwonted flush now upon the girl's usually pale cheeks,  and sudden energy in her step and voice.    The school building contained but two rooms, beside the large hall, and  the cloak rooms upon either side; and as the scholars trooped in, taking  their respective places with more than their usual readiness, but with  unusual bustle and exchange of whispers and inquiring looks, the slender  girl went once more to the entrance and looked up and down the path from  the village.    There was no one in sight, and she turned and put her hand upon the  swaying bell-rope.    \"Stop it, Johnny! There's surely something wrong! Go, now, and ask after  Mr. Brierly. He must be ill!\"    \"He'd 'a sent word, sure,\" said the boy, with conviction, as he snatched  his hat from its nail. But Miss Grant only waved him away and entered  the south room, where the elder pupils were now, for the most part,  assembled.    \"Girls and boys,\" she said, the colour still burning in her cheeks,  \"something has delayed Mr. Brierly. I hope it will be for a short time  only. In the meantime, until we know--know what to expect, you will, of  course, keep your places and take up your studies. I am sure I can trust  you to be as quiet and studious as if your teacher was here; and while  we wait, and I begin my lessons, I shall set no monitor over you. I am  sure you will not need one.\"    The pupils of Charles Brierly were ruled by gentleness and love, and  they were loyal to so mild a ruler. With low whispers and words of  acquiescence, they took up their books, and Miss Grant went back to her  more restless small people, leaving the connecting door between the  north and south rooms open.    Mrs. Fry's cottage was in the heart of the village, and upon the  hillside, but Johnny stayed for nothing, running hither, hat in hand,  and returning panting, and with a troubled face.    \"Miss Grant,\" he panted, bursting into her presence with scant ceremony,  \"he aint there! Mrs. Fry says he came to school before eight o'clock. He  went out while she was combin' Nellie's hair, an' she aint seen him  since!\"    Hilda Grant walked slowly down from her little platform, and advanced,  with a waving movement, until she stood in the doorway between the two  rooms. The colour had all faded from her face, and she put a hand  against the door-pane as if to steady herself, and seemed to control or  compose herself with an effort.    \"Boys--children--have any of you seen Mr. Brierly this morning?\"    For a moment there was an utter silence in the school-room.

The Train to Mariposa            Preface    I know no way in which a writer may more fittingly introduce his work to  the public than by giving a brief account of who and what he is. By this  means some of the blame for what he has done is very properly shifted to  the extenuating circumstances of his life.    I was born at Swanmoor, Hants, England, on December 30, 1869. I am not  aware that there was any particular conjunction of the planets at the  time, but should think it extremely likely. My parents migrated to  Canada in 1876, and I decided to go with them. My father took up a farm  near Lake Simcoe, in Ontario. This was during the hard times of Canadian  farming, and my father was just able by great diligence to pay the hired  men and, in years of plenty, to raise enough grain to have seed for the  next year's crop without buying any. By this process my brothers and  I were inevitably driven off the land, and have become professors,  business men, and engineers, instead of being able to grow up as farm  labourers. Yet I saw enough of farming to speak exuberantly in political  addresses of the joy of early rising and the deep sleep, both of body  and intellect, that is induced by honest manual toil.    I was educated at Upper Canada College, Toronto, of which I was head  boy in 1887. From there I went to the University of Toronto, where  I graduated in 1891. At the University I spent my entire time in the  acquisition of languages, living, dead, and half-dead, and knew nothing  of the outside world. In this diligent pursuit of words I spent about  sixteen hours of each day. Very soon after graduation I had forgotten  the languages, and found myself intellectually bankrupt. In other words  I was what is called a distinguished graduate, and, as such, I took  to school teaching as the only trade I could find that need neither  experience nor intellect. I spent my time from 1891 to 1899 on the staff  of Upper Canada College, an experience which has left me with a profound  sympathy for the many gifted and brilliant men who are compelled to  spend their lives in the most dreary, the most thankless, and the worst  paid profession in the world. I have noted that of my pupils, those who  seemed the laziest and the least enamoured of books are now rising  to eminence at the bar, in business, and in public life; the really  promising boys who took all the prizes are now able with difficulty to  earn the wages of a clerk in a summer hotel or a deck hand on a canal  boat.    In 1899 I gave up school teaching in disgust, borrowing enough money  to live upon for a few months, and went to the University of Chicago  to study economics and political science. I was soon appointed to a  Fellowship in political economy, and by means of this and some temporary  employment by McGill University, I survived until I took the degree of  Doctor of Philosophy in 1903. The meaning of this degree is that the  recipient of instruction is examined for the last time in his life, and  is pronounced completely full. After this, no new ideas can be imparted  to him.    From this time, and since my marriage, which had occurred at this  period, I have belonged to the staff of McGill University, first as  lecturer in Political Science, and later as head of the department of  Economics and Political Science. As this position is one of the prizes  of my profession, I am able to regard myself as singularly fortunate.  The emolument is so high as to place me distinctly above the policemen,  postmen, street-car conductors, and other salaried officials of the  neighbourhood, while I am able to mix with the poorer of the business  men of the city on terms of something like equality. In point of  leisure, I enjoy more in the four corners of a single year than a  business man knows in his whole life. I thus have what the business man  can never enjoy, an ability to think, and, what is still better, to stop  thinking altogether for months at a time.    I have written a number of things in connection with my college life--a  book on Political Science, and many essays, magazine articles, and so  on. I belong to the Political Science Association of America, to the  Royal Colonial Institute, and to the Church of England. These things,  surely, are a proof of respectability. I have had some small connection  with politics and public life. A few years ago I went all round the  British Empire delivering addresses on Imperial organization. When I  state that these lectures were followed almost immediately by the Union  of South Africa, the Banana Riots in Trinidad, and the Turco-Italian  war, I think the reader can form some idea of their importance. In  Canada I belong to the Conservative party, but as yet I have failed  entirely in Canadian politics, never having received a contract to build  a bridge, or make a wharf, nor to construct even the smallest section  of the Transcontinental Railway. This, however, is a form of national  ingratitude to which one becomes accustomed in this Dominion.    Apart from my college work, I have written two books, one called  \"Literary Lapses\" and the other \"Nonsense Novels.\" Each of these is  published by John Lane (London and New York), and either of them can be  obtained, absurd though it sounds, for the mere sum of three shillings  and sixpence. Any reader of this preface, for example, ridiculous though  it appears, could walk into a bookstore and buy both of these books for  seven shillings. Yet these works are of so humorous a character that for  many years it was found impossible to print them. The compositors fell  back from their task suffocated with laughter and gasping for air.  Nothing but the intervention of the linotype machine--or rather, of the  kind of men who operate it--made it possible to print these books. Even  now people have to be very careful in circulating them, and the books  should never be put into the hands of persons not in robust health.    Many of my friends are under the impression that I write these humorous  nothings in idle moments when the wearied brain is unable to perform the  serious labours of the economist. My own experience is exactly the other  way. The writing of solid, instructive stuff fortified by facts and  figures is easy enough. There is no trouble in writing a scientific  treatise on the folk-lore of Central China, or a statistical enquiry  into the declining population of Prince Edward Island. But to write  something out of one's own mind, worth reading for its own sake, is an  arduous contrivance only to be achieved in fortunate moments, few  and far between. Personally, I would sooner have written \"Alice in  Wonderland\" than the whole Encyclopaedia Britannica.    In regard to the present work I must disclaim at once all intentions of  trying to do anything so ridiculously easy as writing about a real place  and real people. Mariposa is not a real town. On the contrary, it is  about seventy or eighty of them. You may find them all the way from Lake  Superior to the sea, with the same square streets and the same maple  trees and the same churches and hotels, and everywhere the sunshine of  the land of hope.    Similarly, the Reverend Mr. Drone is not one person but about eight or  ten. To make him I clapped the gaiters of one ecclesiastic round the  legs of another, added the sermons of a third and the character of a  fourth, and so let him start on his way in the book to pick up such  individual attributes as he might find for himself. Mullins and Bagshaw  and Judge Pepperleigh and the rest are, it is true, personal friends  of mine. But I have known them in such a variety of forms, with such  alternations of tall and short, dark and fair, that, individually,  I should have much ado to know them. Mr. Pupkin is found whenever a  Canadian bank opens a branch in a county town and needs a teller. As for  Mr. Smith, with his two hundred and eighty pounds, his hoarse voice,  his loud check suit, his diamonds, the roughness of his address and  the goodness of his heart,--all of this is known by everybody to be a  necessary and universal adjunct of the hotel business.    The inspiration of the book,--a land of hope and sunshine where little  towns spread their square streets and their trim maple trees beside  placid lakes almost within echo of the primeval forest,--is large  enough. If it fails in its portrayal of the scenes and the country that  it depicts the fault lies rather with an art that is deficient than in  an affection that is wanting.    Stephen Leacock. McGill University, June, 1912.          ONE. The Hostelry of Mr. Smith    I don't know whether you know Mariposa. If not, it is of no consequence,  for if you know Canada at all, you are probably well acquainted with a  dozen towns just like it.    There it lies in the sunlight, sloping up from the little lake that  spreads out at the foot of the hillside on which the town is built.  There is a wharf beside the lake, and lying alongside of it a steamer  that is tied to the wharf with two ropes of about the same size as they  use on the Lusitania. The steamer goes nowhere in particular, for the  lake is landlocked and there is no navigation for the Mariposa Belle  except to \"run trips\" on the first of July and the Queen's Birthday, and  to take excursions of the Knights of Pythias"]]]
