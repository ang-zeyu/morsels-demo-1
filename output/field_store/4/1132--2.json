Nesbit          To Margaret Ostler with love from E. Nesbit    Peggy, you came from the heath and moor,  And you brought their airs through my open door;  You brought the blossom of youth to blow  In the Latin Quarter of Soho.  For the sake of that magic I send you here  A tale of enchantments, Peggy dear,   A bit of my work, and a bit of my heart...  The bit that you left when we had to part.    Royalty Chambers, Soho, W. 25  September 1907          There were three of them Jerry, Jimmy, and Kathleen. Of course,  Jerry's name was Gerald, and not Jeremiah, whatever you may  think; and Jimmy's name was James; and Kathleen was never  called by her name at all, but Cathy, or Catty, or Puss Cat, when  her brothers were pleased with her, and Scratch Cat when they  were not pleased. And they were at school in a little town in the  West of England the boys at one school, of course, and the girl at  another, because the sensible habit of having boys and girls at the  same school is not yet as common as I hope it will be some day.  They used to see each other on Saturdays and Sundays at the house  of a kind maiden lady; but it was one of those houses where it is  impossible to play. You know the kind of house, don't you? There  is a sort of a something about that kind of house that makes you  hardly able even to talk to each other when you are left alone, and  playing seems unnatural and affected. So they looked forward to  the holidays, when they should all go home and be together all day  long, in a house where playing was natural and conversation  possible, and where the Hampshire forests and fields were full of  interesting things to do and see. Their Cousin Betty was to be there  too, and there were plans. Betty's school broke up before theirs,  and so she got to the Hampshire home first, and the moment she  got there she began to have measles, so that my three couldn't go  home at all. You may imagine their feelings. The thought of seven  weeks at Miss Hervey's was not to be borne, and all three wrote  home and said so. This astonished their parents very much,  because they had always thought it was so nice for the children to  have dear Miss Hervey's to go to. However, they were \"jolly decent  about it , as Jerry said, and after a lot of letters and telegrams, it  was arranged that the boys should go and stay at Kathleen's school,  where there were now no girls left and no mistresses except the  French one.    \"It'll be better than being at Miss Hervey's,\" said Kathleen, when  the boys came round to ask Mademoiselle when it would be  convenient for them to come; \"and, besides, our school's not half  so ugly as yours. We do have tablecloths on the tables and curtains  at the windows, and yours is all deal boards, and desks, and  inkiness.\"    When they had gone to pack their boxes Kathleen made all the  rooms as pretty as she could with flowers in jam jars marigolds  chiefly, because there was nothing much else in the back garden.  There were geraniums in the front garden, and calceolarias and  lobelias; of course, the children were not allowed to pick these.    \"We ought to have some sort of play to keep us going through the  holidays,\" said Kathleen, when tea was over, and she had unpacked  and arranged the boys clothes in the painted chests of drawers,  feeling very grown-up and careful as she neatly laid the different  sorts of clothes in tidy little heaps in the drawers. \"Suppose we  write a book.\"    \"You couldn't,\" said Jimmy.    \"I didn't mean me, of course,\" said Kathleen, a little injured; \"I  meant us.\"    \"Too much fag,\" said Gerald briefly.    \"If we wrote a book,\" Kathleen persisted, \"about what the insides  of schools really are like, people would read it and say how clever  we were.\"    \"More likely expel us,\" said Gerald. \"No; we'll have an  out-of-doors game bandits, or something like that. It wouldn't be  bad if we could get a cave and keep stores in it, and have our  meals there.\"    \"There aren't any caves,\" said Jimmy, who was fond of  contradicting everyone. \"And, besides, your precious Mamselle  won't let us go out alone, as likely as not.\"    \"Oh, we'll see about that,\" said Gerald. \"I'll go and talk to her like a  father.\"    \"Like that?\" Kathleen pointed the thumb of scorn at him, and he  looked in the glass.    \"To brush his hair and his clothes and to wash his face and hands  was to our hero but the work of a moment,\" said Gerald, and went  to suit the action to the word.    It was a very sleek boy, brown and thin and interesting-looking,  that knocked at the door of the parlour where Mademoiselle sat  reading a yellow-covered book and wishing vain wishes. Gerald  could always make himself look interesting at a moment's notice, a  very useful accomplishment in dealing with strange grown-ups. It  was done by opening his grey eyes rather wide, allowing the  corners of his mouth to droop, and assuming a gentle, pleading  expression, resembling that of the late little Lord Fauntleroy who  must, by the way, be quite old now, and an awful prig.    \"Entrez!\" said Mademoiselle, in shrill French accents. So he  entered.    \"Eh bien?\" she said rather impatiently.    \"I hope I am not disturbing you,\" said Gerald, in whose mouth, it  seemed, butter would not have melted.    \"But no,\" she said, somewhat softened. \"What is it that you  desire?\"    \"I thought I ought to come and say how do you do,\" said Gerald,  \"because of you being the lady of the house.\"    He held out the newly-washed hand, still damp and red. She took  it.    \"You are a very polite little boy,\" she said.    \"Not at all,\" said Gerald, more polite than ever. \"I am so sorry for  you. It must be dreadful to have us to look after in the holidays.\"    \"But not at all,\" said Mademoiselle in her turn. \"I am sure you will  be very good childrens.\"    Gerald's look assured her that he and the others would be as near  angels as children could be without ceasing to be human.\"We'll  try,\" he said earnestly.    \"Can one do anything for you?\" asked the French governess kindly.    \"Oh, no, thank you,\" said Gerald. \"We don't want to give you any  trouble at all. And I was thinking it would be less trouble for you if  we were to go out into the woods all day tomorrow and take our  dinner with us something cold, you know so as not to be a trouble  to the cook.\"    \"You are very considerate,\" said Mademoiselle coldly. Then  Gerald's eyes smiled; they had a trick of doing this when his lips  were quite serious. Mademoiselle caught the twinkle, and she  laughed and Gerald laughed too.    \"Little deceiver!\" she said. \"Why not say at once you want to be  free of surveillance, how you say overwatching without pretending  it is me you wish to please?\"    \"You have to be careful with grown-ups, \" said Gerald, \"but it isn't  all pretence either. We don't want to trouble you and we don't want  you to \"    \"To trouble you. Eh bien! Your parents, they permit these days at  woods?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said Gerald truthfully.    \"Then I will not be more a dragon than the parents. I will forewarn  the cook. Are you content?\"    \"Rather!\" said Gerald. \"Mademoiselle, you are a dear.\"    \"A deer?\" she repeated \"a stag?\"    \"No, a a cherie,\" said Gerald \"a regular A1 cherie. And you sha'n't  repent it. Is there anything we can do for you wind your wool, or  find your spectacles, or ?\"    \"He thinks me a grandmother!\" said Mademoiselle, laughing more  than ever. \"Go then, and be not more naughty than you must.\"    \"Well, what luck?\" the others asked.    \"It's all right,\" said Gerald indifferently. \"I told you it would be.  The ingenuous youth won the regard of the foreign governess, who  in her youth had been the beauty of her humble village.\"    \"I don't believe she ever was. She's too stern,\" said Kathleen.    \"Ah!\" said Gerald, \"that's only because you don't know how to  manage her. She wasn't stern with me.\"    \"I say,\" what a humbug you are though, aren't you?\" said Jimmy.    \"No, I'm a dip what's-its-name? Something like an ambassador.  Dipsoplomatist that's what I am. Anyhow, we've got our day, and if  we don't find a cave in it my name's not Jack Robinson.\"    Mademoiselle, less stern than Kathleen had ever seen her, presided  at supper, which was bread and treacle spread several hours  before, and now harder and drier than any other food you can think  of. Gerald was very polite in handing her butter and cheese, and  pressing her to taste the bread and treacle.    \"Bah! it is like sand in the mouth of a dryness! Is it possible this  pleases you?\"    \"No,\" said Gerald, \"it is not possible, but it is not polite for boys to  make remarks about their food!\"    She laughed, but there was no more dried bread and treacle for  supper after that.    \"How do you do it?\" Kathleen whispered admiringly as they said  good night.    \"Oh, it's quite easy when you've once got a grownup to see what  you're after. You'll see, I shall drive her with a rein of darning  cotton after this.\"    Next morning Gerald got up early and gathered a little bunch of  pink carnations from a plant which he found hidden among the  marigolds. He tied it up with black cotton and laid it on  Mademoiselle's plate. She smiled and looked quite handsome as  she stuck the flowers in her belt.    \"Do you think it's quite decent,\" Jimmy asked later \"sort of bribing  people to let you do as you like with flowers and things and  passing them the salt?\"    \"It's not that,\" said Kathleen suddenly. \"I know what Gerald means,  only I never think of the things in time myself. You see, if you  want grown-ups to be nice to you the least you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35409"],[0,"Beauty: Illustrated Chiefly (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/American Libraries.)                      BEAUTY;    ILLUSTRATED CHIEFLY BY AN    ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION    OF BEAUTY IN WOMAN,      BY ALEXANDER WALKER,    AUTHOR OF \"INTERMARRIAGE,\" \"WOMAN,\" \"PHYSIOGNOMY FOUNDED    ON PHYSIOLOGY,\" \"THE NERVOUS SYSTEM,\" ETC.      EDITED BY AN AMERICAN PHYSICIAN      NEW YORK:    HENRY G. LANGLEY, 8 ASTOR-HOUSE.    1845.          Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1840, BY J. & H. G.  LANGLEY, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the Southern  District of New York    STEREOTYPED BY J. S. REDFIELD,    _13 Chambers Street, New York_          DEDICATION.      TO GEORGE BIRBECK, M.D., F.G.S.,    PRESIDENT OF THE LONDON MECHANICS' INSTITUTION, &c., &c., &c.      A department of science, which in many respects must be regarded as new,  cannot so properly be dedicated to any one as to the inventor of the best  mode of diffusing scientific knowledge among the most meritorious and most  oppressed classes of society.    When the enemies of freedom, in order effectually to blind the victims of  their spoliation, imposed a tax upon knowledge, you rendered the  acquirement of science easy by the establishment of mechanics'  institutions--you gave the first and greatest impulse to that diffusion of  knowledge which will render the repetition of such a conspiracy against  humanity impossible.    You more than once also wrested a reluctant concession, in behalf of  untaxed knowledge, from the men who had evidently succeeded, in some  degree, to the spirit, as well as to the office, of the original  conspirators, and who unwisely hesitated between the bad interest which is  soon felt by all participators in expensive government, and their dread of  the new and triumphant power of public opinion, before which they know and  feel that they are but as the chaff before the whirlwind.    For these services, accept this respectful dedication, as the expression  of a homage, in which I am sure that I am joined by thousands of Britons.    Nor, in writing this, on a subject of which your extensive knowledge  enables you so well to judge, am I without a peculiar and personal motive.    I gratefully acknowledge that, in one of the most earnest and strenuous  mental efforts I ever made, in my work on \"The Nervous System,\" I owed to  your cautions as to logical reasoning and careful induction, an anxiety at  least, and a zeal in these respects, which, whatever success may have  attended them, could not well be exceeded.    I have endeavored to act conformably with the same cautions in the present  work. He must be weak-minded, indeed, who can seek for aught in philosophy  but the discovery of truth; and he must be a coward who, believing he has  discovered it, has any scruple to announce it.    ALEXANDER WALKER.    APRIL 10, 1836.          AMERICAN ADVERTISEMENT.      The present volume completes the series of Mr. Walker's anthropological  works. To say that they have met with a favorable reception from the  American public, would be but a very inadequate expression of the  unprecedented success which has attended their publication.  \"INTERMARRIAGE,\" the first of the series, passed through six large  editions within eighteen months, and \"WOMAN,\" has met with a sale scarcely  less extensive. The numerous calls for the present work, have compelled  the publishers to issue it sooner than they had contemplated; and, it is  believed, that it will be found not less worthy of attention than the  preceding.    All must acknowledge the interesting nature of the subject treated in the  present work, as well as its intimate connexion with those which have  already passed under discussion. The analysis of beauty on philosophical  principles, is attended with numerous difficulties, not the least of which  arises from the want of any fixed and acknowledged standard. The term  Beauty is, indeed, generally considered as a vague generality, varying  according to national, and even individual taste and judgment.    Mr. Walker claims, in his advertisement, numerous points of originality,  some of which, on examination, may perhaps prove to have been proposed  previously by other writers. Enough, however, will remain to entitle him  to the credit of great ingenuity and acuteness. As treated by him, the  subject assumes an aspect very different from that exhibited in any other  publication. To trace the connexion of beauty with, and its dependance on,  anatomical structure and physiological laws--to show how it may be  modified by causes within our control--to describe its different forms and  modifications, and defects, as indicated by certain physical signs--to  analyze its elements, with a view to its influence on individuals and  society, in connexion with its perpetration in posterity--all these were  novel topics of vast and exciting interest, and well adapted to the  genius, taste, and research of our author.    In preparing the present edition, it has been thought expedient to make  some verbal alterations, and omit a few paragraphs, to which a refined  taste might perhaps object, and to bring together in the Appendix such  collateral matter, as might serve to correct, extend, or illustrate the  views presented in the text. With these explanations, the work is  confidently commended to the popular as well as philosophical reader, as  worthy of studious examination.          CONTENTS.
