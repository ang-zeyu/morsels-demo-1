The present bulletin is a reprint from The Philippine Craftsman,  Vol. I, Nos. 3, 4, and 5, and is issued in this form for the purpose  of placing in the hands of teachers a convenient manual for use in  giving instruction in this important branch of industrial work. In  it are contained directions for the preparation of materials for mat  making, with suggestive color schemes for these materials and details  for weaving a number of approved Philippine designs.    The use of mats for sleeping and other household purposes is universal  through the extreme Orient. Suitable mat materials abound in these  Islands, and when proper attention shall have been given to the  artistic and decorative side of their manufacture, the mat industry  may well become a source of considerable revenue in thousands of  Filipino homes.    The Bureau of Education has for some years past been endeavoring to  improve the designs used as well as the workmanship of Philippine mats,  in order that the article produced shall be typical of the country,  artistic in design, and of real commercial value. It is expected that  this end will be definitely furthered through the study and use of  the material contained in this reprint.    A considerable part of the subject matter of this publication  is the original work of Mr. Hugo H. Miller, Mr. John F. Minier,  Mr. U. S. Andes, Mr. Theodore Muller, and Mrs. Alice Brezina. Credit is  also due to numerous American and Filipino teachers for the submission  of reports and materials used in its preparation.      Frank L. Crone,    Acting Director.    Manila, February 1, 1913.              PHILIPPINE MATS.      The production of mats in the Philippines is large because of the  extensive domestic demand for them. The sleeping mat [1] is used  throughout the Christian provinces, and is also found among the  Moros. Such mats are of the finer class and are usually more or less  highly decorated with colored straws in various designs. For this  purpose the buri petates are more widely produced than those made from  any other material. Pandan mats are considered stronger and cooler  but their use is not so extensive, probably because they are more  expensive than the buri mats. In the Visayas, tikug mats are important.    Another use of mats is in the baling of two of the staple products of  the Philippines, tobacco and abaca. In the Cagayan valley mats of dried  banana petioles are employed. A great many of these are made in Batac,  Ilocos Norte, from which place they are shipped to Cagayan. In most  cases the tobacco of the Visayas is packed in such mats also. At Argao,  Cebu, banana petiole mats are woven as a by-product of the saba cloth  industry. In obtaining the fiber, the outer skin of the petiole is  pulled off for stripping, and the remaining portion, which is called  \"upag,\" is dried and woven into very coarse mats by children. These  are called \"bastos\" [2] or \"liplip,\" and are disposed of to the tobacco  balers in the town, or are shipped to Cebu and other towns for baling  purposes. While saba sinamay is produced in several of the districts  in the Visayas, notably in Bohol, it is not known that the upag is  used for mat weaving there.    Coarse buri mats are almost exclusively used in wrapping abaca for  the export trade. Since baling is carried on only in large seaports,  particularly in Manila and Cebu, the weaving of these mats in certain  localities where the buri palm is abundant and their transportation  to the hemp-producing towns are important industries.    While they are not, strictly speaking, mats, plaited sacks [3] are  woven in the same weave and bear the same relation to sugar and rice as  do mats to tobacco and abaca. Most of the domestic rice crop entering  into commerce is packed in buri sacks and practically all the export  sugar is sent away in them. A few bayones are made of pandan. The  production of bayones is an important industry in certain districts.    Mats are also employed throughout the provinces for drying paddy  and copra in the sun, in the same manner in which trays are used for  sun-curing fruit in temperate regions.    The use of the finer grades of petates for floor mats and for  wall decoration is confined to the foreign population in the  Philippines. Nevertheless, a considerable number is so utilized. For  this trade only mats of the better grades are demanded, and the number  sold for the purpose is probably considerably restricted by the fact  that few mats are of suitable color combination and of proper design  to satisfy foreign taste. As yet there is no known commercial export  of Philippine mats. There is a considerable demand for floor mats and  mats for wall decoration in Europe and in the United States, but it  is improbable that the Philippines can hope to supply any part of it  unless designs and color combinations are vastly improved. Floor mats  are used as rugs in the same manner as are the strips of Japanese  matting which are so popular all over the world. Round floor mats,  somewhat larger in diameter than the round table tops, are also in  demand. Small mats can be used as doilies on the table or under the  stands of flower pots and the like.    Sleeping mats and mats intended for floors, walls, stands, and mat  doilies are the ones which are suitable for domestic and foreign  commerce, and industrial education must interest itself in them. The  Philippine materials available for weaving these mats are varied and  well distributed. With improvement in color combination and design,  there should be a large increase in the industry.            BLEACHING AGENTS.      Sunshine is used to bleach all mat straws, but more often they are  also treated with boiling water to which certain bleaching agents  have been added. Only the most important of these are explained.    Tamarind.--This tree (Tamarindus indica) is known in Tagalog,  Bicol and Pampanga as sampalok, in Visayan as sambag, in Ilocano  as salamagui, and in Palawan as kalampisao. It is a large tree  with dense foliage. The leaves are employed as a bleaching agent in  boiling water. It is said that the young green fruit can be used for  this purpose.    Pandakaki.--The leaves of the plant (Tabernaemontana pandacaqui)  are used as a bleaching agent. This is the name under which it is  known, particularly in Pampanga and Cavite. In Palawan it is called  alibetbet. It is also known as kampopot in Tagalog and as alibubut  and toar in parts of the Visayas. In Ilocano the name is kurribuetbuet.    Lemons.--The juice of the various species and varieties of Citrus is  employed to some extent for bleaching. It is usually added to boiling  water in which the straw is immersed.    Vinegar.--Of Philippine vinegars, those made from palm juices are  considered about half as strong as lemon juice. Vinegar from sugar  cane juice has probably the same strength. That made from cooked rice  is considered about one-fourth as strong as lemon juice.    Alum.--In some towns alum is added to the boiling water in which  straw is treated. It is usually employed in combination with other  bleaching agents.            DYES USED ON MAT STRAWS.      Mordants.    A mordant is a substance employed to fix the dye to the material. In  general, different ones are needed for different dyes and various  materials. In some cases the mordant is added to the dye liquid;  in others the material is previously treated with it before being  colored. The most important are the mineral mordants, such as the  alumina, the iron, the tin, and the chrome. These are not used in  the Philippines with local vegetable dyes. Tannin is also important  and is employed to some extent in the Philippines, being generally  obtained from the mangrove tan barks. Wood ashes are little used but  vinegar and lemon juice are important.    Kolis.--The leaves of this plant (Memecylon edule) are commonly used  in mordanting buri straw before dyeing it with sappan wood. In Tanay,  Rizal, it is employed on sabutan straw with all of the vegetable  dyes. It is known as guisian (Laguna), duigim (Ilocos, Pangasinan),  kulis (Rizal, Nueva Ecija, Bataan), tagobachi (Leyte), kasigay  (Ilocos Norte), agam (Negrito, Cagayan), guisoc-guisoc (Sorsogon),  macaasin (Tayabas), baian (Zambales), diyatdiyatan (Tayabas), candong  (Pangasinan), dioc (Pangasinan).        Natural Vegetable Dyes.    Numerous natural vegetable dyes are employed in the Philippines. Those  used on the mat straws are limited in number. The important ones only  are here noted. The whole question of dyes is a most difficult one  and hardly warrants the time which has been spent upon investigating  the various dye materials, nor the effort which would be necessary  to determine definitely the methods by which they can be used on mat  straws. The artificial dyes have driven the natural vegetable dyes  out of use because they are cheaper and are more easily applied, and  because in most cases they produce more pleasing and lasting colors.    Sappan.--This plant (Caesalpinia sappan) is known as sapang in  Tagalog and Ilocano and as sibucao in Visayan and Bicol. A beautiful  dye varying from red to red-orange (see Plate III) is obtained from  chips of the wood. This is employed on most Philippine fibers.

TO       MY DEAR WIFE        THIS ESSAY            IS      AFFECTIONATELY        DEDICATED          PREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION.      A ninth edition of this book having been called for, I take the  opportunity to return my sincere thanks for the many kind expressions  concerning its usefulness which have reached me since the lamented death  of its author, my dear husband.    In carrying on his work, both my daughter and myself have felt the  benefit of the clear and concise instructions the book contains.    We have also proved with our pupils the absolute truth and value of the  BEHNKE SYSTEM OF VOICE TRAINING, by means of which we have obtained  results most gratifying to ourselves, and surprising to the pupils,  whether speakers or singers.    I hope that the new chapter on \"Voice Failure,\" which I have added by  Mr. Curwen's desire, may be of some use in preventing breakdown of  voice, from which so many students suffer.    K. BEHNKE.    18, EARL'S COURT SQUARE, S.W.          PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.      A THIRD edition of this little book has now become necessary, and I must  again express my gratitude for the continued commendations bestowed upon  my work both in the press and in private letters.    In response to many solicitations, I have added to this edition a few  hints on teaching, deduced from physiological facts, which may prove  useful by stimulating the advance of thought in a new direction.    These hints are extracts from a series of articles on \"Science and  Singing\" which I had the pleasure of writing in the _Edinburgh St.  Cecilia Magazine_; and I am indebted to the Editor, Mr. A. C. Miller,  for kindly permitting me to reproduce them here.          PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.      The favourable reception and rapid sale of a large first edition has  stimulated me to revise this little book, and without alteration of my  original scheme of practical utility, to somewhat enlarge on one or two  points which appeared to demand further elucidation.    In this, as in the former edition, I have received great assistance from  my friend Mr. Lennox Browne, the eminent throat surgeon, who, by ever  patiently discussing with me debatable points, and by giving me access  to cases, interesting from a physiological point of view, both at the  Central Throat and Ear Hospital, Gray's Inn Road, and in his extensive  private practice, has afforded me opportunities of increasing my  knowledge and experience which would not have arisen otherwise. I feel  it a pleasure as well as a duty publicly to acknowledge my indebtedness  to him, which I have, many times before, expressed in private.    My best thanks are also due to Mr. J. Spencer Curwen, for the help he  has rendered me in many ways.    And finally, it would indeed be ungrateful on my part, if I did not  place on record the obligation under which I consider myself to my  reviewers for the uniformly favourable notice they have so kindly taken  of my first effort, and for several useful hints of which I have duly  taken advantage.    One objection has been made which strikes at the very root of the plan  upon which I have proceeded in my little volume, and to which,  therefore, I beg leave to say a few words in reply. A learned writer in  the _Athenaeum_ finds fault with me for making use of popular instead of  scientific terms, which, he says, may be the cause to the reader of  great confusion if he refers to other works, and he adds that \"Back  Ring-Pyramid Muscle\" is almost as hard a mouthful as \"Crico-Arytenoideus  posticus.\" I have asked several non-scientific friends of good general  education to read this sentence to me, and they succeeded very well with  \"Back Ring-Pyramid Muscle,\" while they utterly collapsed when coming to  \"Crico-Arytenoideus posticus.\"    This is, however, in my humble opinion, of minor importance. The great  point is, that my terms--which by the way are not inventions, but simply  translations--convey a meaning to the general reader, and the originals  do not. This is a fact which I dared not ignore, because my essay is  intended for the people and not for men of science. As I have taken care  also, for the sake of those who might wish to consult other and more  learned books than mine, to give the terms generally used by  physiologists by the side of my translations, I do not think there is  anything that could ever confuse my readers.    I conscientiously believe that these are good and weighty reasons for  the plan I adopted in the first edition, and trust my reviewers, as well  as my readers, will accept them as a sufficient justification of the  same practice in the present volume.    E. B.    _February, 1881._          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.      The number of books bearing more or less directly on the Theory of Voice  Production which have been published during the last few years is very  large, and shows clearly the extraordinary interest taken in this  subject, not only by professional singers and speakers, but also by the  general public. If I am now about to add another contribution to this  already extensive literature, it is simply because amongst all the many  excellent works on the Human Voice there is not one which brings before  the reader the whole subject from beginning to end. The student who  really wishes to get a clear understanding of the matter is obliged to  wade through a variety of scientific books, and to pick up here and  there, by means of very hard reading, such little scraps of information  as, with much labour and waste of time, he can extract from books which  were, in most instances, never written for the purpose for which he  consults them.           *       *       *       *       *    To supply this generally-admitted want I have written these pages, in  which I have endeavoured, to the best of my ability, to place before the  reader in a simple and comprehensive form the Physiology of the Human  Voice. I have, as far as possible, discarded all scientific terms, and  it has been my aim to treat my subject in so simple and direct a manner  as really to enlighten my readers instead of bewildering them. A  treatise like this can, under no circumstances, be light reading; and I  ask those who are truly anxious for information to give me patient  study, accompanied by careful reference to the diagrams. For students  who enter upon a perusal of these pages in such a spirit, this essay is  specially intended; and if I have succeeded in making plain to such as  these a really complicated subject, then my highest ambition will be  satisfied.

We are living in an age which is singularly poor in fine voices, both  male and female, and with regard to the tenors of the present time there  is this additional misfortune, that, as a rule, their voices do not  last, but are often worn out in a very few years; in many instances  while their owners are still under training, and before they have had an  opportunity of making their appearance in public.
