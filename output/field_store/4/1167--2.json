INTRODUCTION      In trying to determine the ancestral relationships of modern orders of  Amphibia it is not possible to select satisfactory structural ancestors  among a wealth of fossils, since very few of the known fossils could  even be considered possible, and scarcely any are satisfactory, for such  a selection. The nearest approach thus far to a solution of the problem  in this manner has been made with reference to the Anura. Watson's paper  (1940), with certain modifications made necessary by Gregory (1950),  provides the paleontological evidence so far available on the origin of  frogs. It shows that several features of the skeleton of frogs, such as  the enlargement of the interpterygoid spaces and orbits, reduction of  the more posterior dermal bones of the skull, and downward spread of the  neural arches lateral to the notochord, were already apparent in the  Pennsylvanian _Amphibamus_ (Fig. 1), with which Gregory synonymized  _Miobatrachus_ and _Mazonerpeton_. But between the Pennsylvanian and the  Triassic (the age of the earliest known frog, _Protobatrachus_) there  was a great lapse of time, and that which passed between any conceivable  Paleozoic ancestor of Urodela and the earliest satisfactory  representative of this order (in the Cretaceous) was much longer still.  The Apoda, so far as known, have no fossil record.    Nevertheless it should be possible, first, to survey those characters of  modern Amphibia that might afford some comparison with the early  fossils, and second, to discover among the known Paleozoic kinds those  which are sufficiently unspecialized to permit derivation of the modern  patterns. Further circumstantial evidence may be obtained by examining  some features of Recent Amphibia which could not readily be compared  with anything in the fossils; such are the embryonic development of the  soft structures, including cartilaginous stages of the skeleton, the  development and various specializations of the ear mechanism, adaptive  characters associated with aquatic and terrestrial life, and so on.          COMPARISON OF MODERN ORDERS WITH THE  LABYRINTHODONTS AND LEPOSPONDYLS      [Illustration: Fig. 1. _Saurerpeton_ (x 1/2, after Romer, 1930, fig. 6);  _Amphibamus_, the palatal view x 2-1/4, from Watson, 1940, fig. 4 (as  _Miobatrachus_), the dorsal view x 2-1/2, from Gregory's revised figure  of _Amphibamus_ (1950, Fig. 1); _Protobatrachus_, x 1, from Watson,  1940, fig. 18, 19.]    In both Anura and Urodela the skull is short, broad, relatively flat,  with reduced pterygoids that diverge laterally from the parasphenoids  leaving large interpterygoid vacuities, and with large orbits. (These  statements do not apply to certain larval or perennibranchiate forms.)  The skull in both orders has lost a number of primitive dermal bones in  the posterior part; these are: basioccipital, supraoccipital,  postparietal, intertemporal, supratemporal, and tabular. The  exoccipitals form the two condyles but there are no foramina for the  11th and 12th nerves, since these are not separate in modern Amphibia.  The opisthotic is missing in all except Proteidae (but see discussion  of the ear). Although the skull is normally autostylic, a movable  basipterygoid articulation is present among Hynobiid salamanders and in  at least the metamorphic stages of primitive frogs, and therefore should  be expected in their ancestors. The vertebrae are, of course, complete;  see discussion in later section. The quadratojugal, lost in salamanders,  is retained in frogs, and conversely the lacrimal, absent in frogs,  occurs in a few primitive salamanders. The situation in Apoda is  different, but postfrontal and jugal should be noted as bones retained  in this order while lost in the others.    Thus, in spite of minor differences, the above list shows that there are  numerous and detailed similarities between Anura and Urodela with  respect to the features in which they differ from the Paleozoic orders.  Pusey (1943) listed 26 characters which _Ascaphus_ shares with  salamanders but not with more advanced frogs; a few of these might be  coincidental, but most of them are of some complexity and must be taken  to indicate relationship. The main adaptive specializations of Anura,  however, including loss of the adult tail, extreme reduction in number  of vertebrae, formation of urostyle, elongation of the ilium and  lengthening of the hind legs, must have appeared at a later time than  the separation of that order from any possible common stem with Urodela,  although they are only partially developed in the Triassic  _Protobatrachus_.    Turning to the Paleozoic Amphibia, there are two groups in which some  likelihood of a relationship with modern order exists. In the  Pennsylvanian Trimerorhachoidea (Labyrinthodontia, order Temnospondyli)  some members, such as _Eugyrinus_, _Saurerpeton_, and notably  _Amphibamus_ (Fig. 1) had short, broad heads, an expansion of palatal  and orbital openings, posterior widening of the parasphenoid associated  with divergence of the pterygoids, a movable basipterygoid articulation,  and reduction in size (but not loss) of the more posterior dermal bones  of the skull. In recognition of Watson's (1940) evidence that these  animals make quite suitable structural ancestors of frogs, Romer (1945)  placed _Amphibamus_ in an order, Eoanura, but Gregory (1950) indicated  that it might better be left with the temnospondyls. Association of the  urodele stem with this group does not seem to have been proposed  hitherto.    The other group of Paleozoic Amphibia that has been considered probably  ancestral to any modern type is the subclass Lepospondyli, containing  three orders, Aistopoda, Nectridia and Microsauria. In these the  vertebrae are complete (holospondylous), the centra presumably formed by  cylindrical ossification around the notochord, and there is no evidence  as to the contributions from embryonic cartilage units. It is important  to note at this point that precisely the same statement can be made  regarding the vertebrae of _adults_ of all three Recent orders, yet for  all of them, as shown in a later section, we have ample evidence of the  part played by cartilage elements in vertebral development. Therefore  (a) we cannot say that there were no such elements in embryonic stages  of lepospondyls, and (b) it would take more than the evidence from adult  vertebrae to relate a particular modern order (for example, Urodela) to  the Lepospondyli. Vague similarities to Urodela have been noted by many  authors in the Nectridia, Aistopoda and Microsauria, but these are not  detailed and refer mainly to the vertebrae. The skulls do not show,  either dorsally or in the palate, any striking resemblance to those of  generalized salamanders, and certainly most known lepospondyls are too  specialized to serve as the source of Urodela. It is true that the  elongate bodies, small limbs, and apparent aquatic habitus of some  lepospondyls accord well with our usual picture of a salamander, but  such a form and way of life have appeared in many early Amphibia,  including the labyrinthodonts. The family Lysorophidae (Fig. 2), usually  placed among microsaurs, is sufficiently close in skull structure to the  Apoda to be a possible ancestor of these, but it probably has nothing to  do with Urodela, by reason of the numerous morphological specializations  that were associated with its snakelike habitus.    [Illustration: Fig. 2. _Lysorophus tricarinatus_, lateral and posterior  views x 2-1/2, modified after Sollas, 1920, Figs. 8 and 12,  respectively; palatal view after Broom, 1918, x 1-1/2. For explanation  of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]    McDowell's (1958) suggestion that it would be profitable to look among  the Seymouriamorpha for the ancestors of frogs seems to be based upon a  few details of apparent resemblance rather than a comprehensive view of  the major characters of the animals. In most points which he mentions  (limb girdles, form of ear, pterygoid articulation) the present writer  does not see a closer similarity of frogs to Seymouriamorpha than to  Temnospondyli.    Still other opinions have been expressed. Herre (1935), for instance,  concludes \"on anatomical, biological and paleontological grounds\" that  the orders of Urodela, Anura, Apoda and Stegocephali were all  independently evolved from fish, but beyond citing the opinions of a  number of other authors he does not present tangible evidence for this  extreme polyphyletic interpretation.    More notable are the views of several Scandinavian workers  (Saeve-Soederbergh, 1934; Jarvik, 1942; Holmgren, 1933, 1939, 1949a, b),  of whom Jarvik, in a thorough analysis of the ethmoid region, would  derive the Urodela from Porolepid Crossopterygii, and all other  tetrapods from the Rhipidistia; Saeve-Soederbergh and Holmgren, the latter  using"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37363"],[0,"Making Up with Mr. Dog (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

That set them to thinking, and  pretty soon Mr. 'Possum said it was too bad to let all that good room go  to waste, and Mr. 'Coon said yes, it was, and that their house was big  enough for a hotel.    Of course he didn't think what he was saying at the time, but it set Mr.  Crow to thinking and walking up and down, whistling, and pretty soon he  stopped still and looked at the 'Coon and 'Possum.    \"I'll do the cookin',\" he said, \"if you'll get the things to cook.\"    And right then and there they made up their minds to do it, and early  the next morning, while the Old Black Crow was hurrying about inside,  getting things ready for business, the 'Coon and the 'Possum nailed up a  sign outside, and this is what was on it:--            THE HOLLOW TREE INN.          BOARD BY THE DAY OR WEEK.    [Illustration: \"HELLO!\" HE SAID. \"WHAT'S THIS?\"]    Then they went inside to help Mr. Crow get ready, and by and by they all  sat down and waited for people to come. Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum felt  pretty well, too, for they thought they would have the easiest time. You  see, they had always depended on Mr. Crow a good deal, for, besides  being a good cook, he was a great hand to provide, and knew more about  where to get the best things, and the best time of day or night to get  them, than both of the others put together. So he didn't say anything,  but dressed up nice and spruce in a clean apron and cooking cap and  leaned out of the window, as cooks always do, with his arms folded. By  and by along came Mr. Jack Rabbit.    \"Hello!\" he said. \"What's this?\"    Then he read the sign over and looked at Mr. Crow and asked him if it  was a joke. And Mr. Crow said:--    \"Not much! Come up and see.\"    So then Mr. Rabbit went up stairs, and Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum showed  him through, and Jack Rabbit said that he didn't feel very well this  summer, anyway, and he believed he'd just shut up his house and come and  board awhile for a change. He said he guessed he'd take the room above  Mr. 'Coon's, because it had a nice south window and a tall looking  glass, and that he'd pack up a few things that he needed and come over  right away. Then he went home and the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old  Black Crow all shook hands and danced around in a circle to think how  well they were going to do, for if Mr. Jack Rabbit came they were sure  of having as many others as their house would hold.    And while they were dancing, along came Mr. Robin. He read the sign,  too, and laughed, and then knocked at the door till Mr. 'Coon came down  and let him in. He thought it was a joke at first, like the Rabbit, but  when he heard that Jack Rabbit was coming to board he spoke up just as  quick as anything and said he'd come, too, and that he'd have his things  there before supper time. He took the room over Mr. Crow, because he  said he didn't mind the smell of the cooking, and then maybe he'd learn  some new receipts. You see, Mr. Crow and Mr. Robin are sort of kinsfolk,  and when they have time they often get together and trace back to find  out just what relation they are to each other, and that makes them good  friends.    Well, Mr. Robin hadn't more'n got out of the house when who should walk  in but Mr. Squirrel.    \"What's all this about boarders?\" said Mr. Squirrel. \"I'm looking for a  place to spend a month or two myself.\"    So then they showed him the room above Mr. 'Possum's, and he was so  pleased with the view and everything that he paid a week's board in  advance to be sure of keeping anybody else from getting it. When he was  gone the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow did another dance, and  kept saying over and over how rich they'd be and what they would do with  all the money. Then they heard somebody laughing outside, and when they  looked out there was Mr. Turtle laughing and reading the sign.    \"Hello!\" he said. \"This isn't the first of April.\"    \"No,\" said Mr. Crow, \"it's a boarding house, and a good one. All the  best people in the country stop here. Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Robin, and Mr.  Squirrel. Sorry, Mr. Turtle, but our rooms are all full.\"    Then Mr. Turtle did look cheap, for he thought he couldn't be in the  crowd, and it was the very crowd he liked to associate with. But just  then Mr. 'Coon happened to think that they might fit up the big room  below the other big room where they all gathered to eat and talk, and  Mr. Turtle said that would suit him exactly, because he was large and  heavy and didn't care much about climbing anyway. So he hurried off  after his things, too, and he wasn't out of sight before here comes Mr.  Dog!    Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum were both looking out the window when he came  up, and they jumped back like lightning. You see, they didn't like Mr.  Dog worth a cent. Then Mr. Crow came and looked out the window and  talked to him. Mr. Dog was just as polite as a basket of chips, and of  course that's the politest thing in the world.    \"I've just seen Mr. Robin,\" said Mr. Dog, \"and I came to get a room,  too.\"    \"Awfully sorry, Mr. Dog, but our rooms are all full,\" said Mr. Crow.    \"Why don't you take down your sign, then?\" said Mr. Dog.    \"Hotels never take down their signs,\" said Mr. Crow.    \"Hotels are never too full for one more, either,\" said Mr. Dog. \"If you  don't let me come in I think I'll wait around here and make a vacancy.\"          THE HOLLOW TREE INN (_Continued_)          WHAT HAPPENS TO MR. DOG      NOW, when Mr. 'Possum and Mr. 'Coon heard that their hair stood up  straight, for they knew very well that there'd be two vacant rooms  anyway if Mr. Dog ever got inside, and two if he stayed where he was,  for they happened to think that Mr. Rabbit would be coming along  presently, and Mr. Squirrel wouldn't be far behind. So they hurried to  the back window and looked out, and sure enough, there was Mr. Rabbit  coming with his trunk on his shoulder and almost there. At first they  were frightened 'most to death for Mr. Rabbit, and then the 'Coon  slipped over and whispered to the Crow to keep Mr. Dog talking as hard  as he could, so he wouldn't notice anything. All the time he was doing  this the 'Possum was motioning to Jack Rabbit to slip up easy-like with  his trunk.    So Mr. Rabbit slipped up softly on the other side of the house from Mr.  Dog and set his trunk down, and the 'Possum let out a long rope with a  hook on it. Jack Rabbit stood up on his trunk and grabbed the hook as  soon as he could reach it and hooked it under his arms. Then the 'Coon  and the 'Possum pulled and pulled and up he came, and as soon as he was  safe they let down the rope and caught the hook in the trunk handle.  That was a load for all three of them, and even then they couldn't get  it up, and called across to the Crow to come quick and help. So he had  to leave Mr. Dog a minute, and when he did that Mr. Dog walked around  the tree, and there was the trunk just a few feet from the ground, going  up very slowly. That was enough for Mr. Dog. He knew then he'd been  fooled, and he was so mad he didn't know what to do.    [Illustration: THERE WAS MR. RABBIT COMING WITH HIS TRUNK]    He took one look at that trunk and made up his mind he wouldn't stand  it. So he stepped back a little and made a short run and gave a jump for  the trunk, just as high as ever he could.    But Mr. Dog wasn't very lucky, for instead of landing on the trunk he  landed his nose right against one corner of it, and that made him madder  than ever. He ran and jumped again harder than before, but this time the  trunk was a little higher and Mr. Dog didn't quite hit it. There was a  strap hanging down, though, and he caught it as he went by. He caught it  with his teeth, and two of his teeth went right through two of the holes  where the buckle catches, and there they stayed. He had the trunk all  right enough, but the trunk had him, too.    [Illustration: AND"]]]
