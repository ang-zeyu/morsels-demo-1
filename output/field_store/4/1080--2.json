But if we are ever to know, for our  different species of mammals, the natural environments under which  their evolution and differentiation occurred, we must study and  describe their habitats and habitat limitations before all the native  areas in the country have been altered by the activities of mankind.  As a contribution to this subject the following paper is presented.    The Warren Woods are a state preserve under the Edward K. Warren  Foundation. They are located in Berrien County, Michigan, about three  miles north of Three Oaks. The preserve consists of about two hundred  acres, of which somewhat less than half is in clearing and the  remainder mostly covered by forest, much of it still nearly in its  primitive condition.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Sketch map of Warren Woods Preserve. The  distribution of the various mammal habitats is indicated.]    The topography is nearly level, though the area is cut by a number of  ravines draining to the Galien River, which flows through the  preserve. Along the river and in its bends there are moderate-sized  flood-plains.    On the flood-plains a few small buttonbush swamps occur; and along the  margins of the river a few freshly formed mud bars have not yet become  forested; but most of the flood-plains are covered by heavy forest.  The higher ground, except that in the clearing, is covered by heavy  beech-maple forest.    Several types of habitats are represented in the clearing: in a few of  the cleared ravines a thick growth of sedges and iris occurs; on the  higher ground small areas are dominated by rushes, other areas by  sedges, while the greater part is covered by grass. In parts of the  clearing blackberries and other shrubs have grown up to form thickets,  and in many places, especially along the edges of ravines,  second-growth trees of oak, maple, or beech grow in the thickets or  form small groves.    The mammal habitats found on the preserve may be listed as follows:    _Natural habitats_        Aquatic habitat      Buttonbush-swamp habitat      Shore habitat      Mud-bar herbage habitat      Flood-plain forest habitat      Beech-maple forest habitat      Aerial habitat    _Modified and artificial habitats_        Second-growth, forest and scrub habitat      Cleared-ravine sedge habitat      Cleared-upland rush habitat      Cleared-upland sedge habitat      Cleared-upland blue-grass habitat      Cultivated field habitat      Orchard habitat      Edificarian habitat    It is unfortunate that all of the area in clearing and about half of  the forested area on the preserve has been and is being heavily  pastured by cattle and horses. The presence of stock has changed the  native conditions so much that, so far as interpreting the primitive  mammal associations is concerned, little dependence can be placed on  studies made in that portion of the preserve. The grass and herbage is  extensively eaten off, and many of the shrubs and young trees eaten  or badly mutilated. Under the pastured forest little underbrush or  herbage remains, and the conditions are very poor for small mammals.    In all the forest, in the unpastured as well as in the pastured part,  a number of trees have been cut out in former years, and although no  trees are now being cut down, all the trees and branches which fall  are being cut up for firewood. This results in there being few logs  and little dead brush on the ground, and removes a favorite place for  small mammal nests and runways, as well as largely eliminating as  mammal food the insects and larvae which are dependent on decaying  wood. However, with the exception of the removal of the logs and of a  few trees, that part of the forest to the north of the river is still  in practically its native condition, and it shows no evidence of ever  having been pastured. It is thus a splendid place for the study of the  native faunal conditions.    Although the whole area in the preserve is small there are other areas  of adjoining forest along the Galien River, so that, for the smaller  mammals at least, the results of the study and trapping should  indicate the primitive habitat distribution. The relative abundance of  the different species, however, is probably much changed by the  decrease throughout the whole region of the carnivores, which have  been much hunted and trapped by man.    The mammals of Warren Woods were intensively studied by the author  from July 3 to September 3 in the summer of 1919. A camp was  maintained near the edge of the Woods, and by trapping and hunting  every effort was made to determine the mammal fauna of the preserve.  From one hundred to two hundred traps for small mammals and about  twenty traps for the larger species were kept constantly in operation.  A small amount of trapping was done in the fields and along the  roadsides immediately adjoining the Woods and a few records were  secured from the camp house.    The work was supported by the Michigan Geological and Biological Survey.  Dr. Alexander G. Ruthven directed the work and gave much assistance in  securing the needed collecting equipment. Much help was given by George  R. Fox, Director of the Warren Foundation, not only in getting to and  from the camp at the Woods and in numerous other courtesies, but also in  information about the Woods and about the mammals there. The plant  identifications were made by Mr. C. Billington.    The figures following the specific names in the lists of mammals from  each habitat indicate the number of individuals trapped, shot, or seen  and positively identified in that habitat.          NATURAL HABITATS      _Aquatic habitat_:         _Mustela vison mink._ Mink. Reported.         _Fiber zibethicus zibethicus._ Muskrat. Reported.    Mink and muskrat are reported by residents to occur in the Galien  River in and near Warren Woods, but I was unable to secure any  specimens though traps were set for them; neither did I see any signs  of their presence.      _Buttonbush-swamp habitat_:         _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed       mouse. 8.         _Mus musculus musculus._ House mouse. 2.    A large buttonbush swamp occurs in the preserve just south of the  Galien River, but around this the native trees have been cut away and  over its accessible edges it has been heavily pastured, so that it is  not at all in its natural conditions, and it was not trapped. In the  unpastured flood-plain north of the river there is another buttonbush  swamp of several hundred yards extent. This latter area was the one  selected for study.    In this typical swamp the buttonbush, _Cephalanthus occidentalis_, is  practically the only plant present. It thickly covers the area with  its tangled branches, which grow to heights of four to ten feet. The  water had drained away in August, leaving the ground bare, though  still wet and soft. Under the cover of the buttonbush there is no  herbage whatever, and upon the ground there are only a few decaying  logs and a few small sticks, which often carry a light growth of moss.    Around the edges of this swamp there is a narrow belt of thick herbage,  closely encroached upon by the typical forest of the flood-plain.    Fifty mouse traps set in this habitat took eight northern white-footed  mice and two house mice the first night, August 5.      _Shore habitat_:         _Procyon lotor lotor._ Raccoon. Tracks.         _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed       mouse. 1.    Along the shores of the Galien River a narrow strip of bare ground was  exposed in July and August. The ground of this strip is mostly mud,  but in a few places it is sand or gravel. Usually the habitat is  narrow, but in some places it is five to ten feet wide.    Tracks of raccoon were frequent on the shore along the river. From a  few mouse traps set on the bare mud shore one northern white-footed  mouse was taken August 4 beside a drift log.      _Mud-bar herbage habitat_:         _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed       mouse. 4.    A few small recently formed mud bars occur along the Galien River in its  outer bends. These bars have not yet had time to become forested, and on  their outer edges nearest the river there is usually no vegetation, this  part being included in the shore habitat. On their older portions next  the forest of the flood-plains occurs a thick growth of herbs, several  annual grasses, and rarely a willow, _Salix_ sp., or a seedling tree of  white elm, _Ulmus americana_, cottonwood, _Populus deltoides_, maple,  _Acer rubrum_ or _saccharinum_, and others of the typical flood-plain  species. The vegetation during August is very thick, and reaches a  height of four to six feet. The soil is either mud or in a few places  fine sand, and the ground is quite moist.    In this habitat four northern white-footed mice were trapped August 3-4.      _Flood-plain forest habitat_:         _Scalopus aquaticus machrinus._ Prairie mole. Ridges.         _Blarina brevicauda talpoides._ Short-tailed shrew. 4.         _Procyon lotor lotor._ Raccoon. 1.         _Mustela noveboracensis noveboracensis._ New York weasel. 1.         _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed       mouse. 52.         _Microtus pinetorum scalopsoides._ Northern pine vole. 5.         _Mus musculus musculus._ House mouse. 2.         _Zapus hudsonius hudsonius._ Hudson Bay jumping mouse. 1.         _Erethizon dorsatum dorsatum._ Canada porcupine.

The mammalian fauna of the western Dakotas and adjacent Montana is  relatively poorly known. Few published reports have dealt with mammals  from this part of the Northern Great Plains, and none of these involved  detailed study of a restricted area. The present report summarizes  information gathered in Harding County, northwestern South Dakota, and  includes material on the more than 50 species of mammals that are known  to occur there.    Harding County has an area of approximately 2700 square miles (Fig. 1).  The county first was organized in 1881, but the present boundaries were  not fixed until 1908. Physiographically, it lies in that part of the  Missouri Plateau frequently termed the \"Cretaceous Table Lands.\" The  general topography is one of rolling hills and flats--mostly range land  vegetated by short grasses and sage--broken by spectacular buttes and  hills that rise 400 to 600 or more feet above the surrounding plains.  These monadnocks are \"... part of a system of Tertiary erosional  remnants standing above the Late Cretaceous rocks of northwestern South  Dakota...,\" according to Lillegraven (1970:832), who went on to point  out: \"The butte tops are flat and grass-covered. The western sides are  being actively cut away by slumping, and the topography below the  western cliff walls is hummocky with sparse vegetation. The eastern  flanks of the tables are, by contrast, less cliff-forming and less  slumped and are generally well forested with coniferous and deciduous  trees.\" Slim Buttes, the North and South Cave Hills, the East and West  Short Pine Hills, and the Long Pine Hills, which barely enter the county  north of Camp Crook, comprise the pine-clad buttes; other prominences,  such as Table Mountain and Sheep Buttes, are all but nude of coniferous  cover. The highest point in the county, \"Harding Peak,\" is 4019 feet  above sea level.    Sediments underlying northwestern South Dakota include rocks assignable  to the Pierre (shale), Fox Hills (sand), and Hell Creek formations of  Cretaceous age and the Ludlow and Tongue River formations of the  Paleocene. These rocks may be exposed at the surface, but usually are  overlain by relatively thin soils that are mostly derived from them; the  best soil in the county for agricultural purposes is the loessal sandy  or silty loam in the northeastern quarter, which is derived from Tongue  River sediments (Baker, 1952).    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map of Harding County, South Dakota, showing  location of places named in text.]    The climate of northwestern South Dakota is characteristic of the  northern part of the interior grasslands of North America--that is, the  winters are cold and the summers hot and dry. Weather data for the  period 1896-1967 at Camp Crook are representative of those gathered at  the several stations maintained in the county. At Camp Crook the mean  temperature for January is 17.3 F, whereas that for July is 71.2 F;  precipitation averages 13.17 inches annually, most falling in the months  of April through September; snowfall amounts to an average of 33.2  inches per year and is recorded from every month from September through  May (Climatogeography of the United States, no. 20-39, Camp Crook, South  Dakota, 1969).    Major surface drainage systems in Harding County include the Little  Missouri River, which flows northward through most of the western part  of the county, the South Fork of the Grand River, which originates in  the east-central part of the county and flows generally eastward, and by  the North Fork of the Moreau River, which originates in the south and  drains in a southeasterly direction. Permanent standing surface water  was virtually unknown prior to the development of artificial  impoundments.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Central part of Slim Buttes as viewed from the  east.]    Vegetation of the grassland areas in the county is typical of that found  throughout the semi-arid Northern Great Plains. Cover on upland soils,  especially those that are clayey in substance, generally is sparse;  areas along water courses and well-watered sites elsewhere tend to have  denser stands of grasses such as bluestem (_Andropogon_). Dominant  grasses of upland are gramma, buffalo grass, wheat grass, stipa, and  tickle grass. Sage (_Artemisia_) and numerous forbs are prominent in  many areas. These grasslands are used extensively for grazing of sheep  and cattle.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Fuller Canyon, North Cave Hills.]    [Illustration: FIG. 4.

Spring-fed artificial impoundment in Deer Draw,  Slim Buttes.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8. Farm land in northeastern part of Harding  County.]    The wooded buttes mentioned above are at least in part within the  boundaries of Custer National Forest and support western yellow pine  (_Pinus ponderosa_) and junipers (_Juniperus_ sp.). In some ravines and  other protected sites there are groves of deciduous trees such as  cottonwood, aspen, boxelder, ash, hackberry, elm, dogwood, and hawthorn,  usually associated with shrubs such as buckbrush, chokeberry, plum,  currant, and gooseberry. These groves frequently are associated with  small springs, as the one in Deer Draw of the Slim Buttes. The major  water courses and their tributaries are essentially treeless, although  occasional stands of cottonwoods and other deciduous trees and shrubs  occur in some places--for example along the Little Missouri near Camp  Crook. Some representative habitats in Harding County are illustrated in  Figs. 2-8.    Our interest in Harding County dates from August of 1960, when one of us  (Jones) and Robert R. Patterson visited the area briefly and obtained a  small collection of mammals. Subsequently, field parties from the Museum  of Natural History collected mammals in the county in the periods 14-30  June 1961, 23 March-11 April 1963, 5-7 July 1965, and 13 May-11 June  1968. Incidental collection also occurred in the extreme western part of  the county in the period 29 June-24 July 1970 when a group was working  primarily in the Long Pine Hills of adjacent Carter County, Montana.    There are few published references to mammals in Harding County. Visher  (1914), in an early biological survey of the area, listed 40 species of  mammals, but his accounts are mainly of historic value. Subsequently,  publications by Bailey (1915), Young (1944), Goldman (1944), Over and  Churchill (1945), Jones and Genoways (1967), and Henderson _et al._  (1969) have recorded mammals from the county.      ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES    Fifty-three species of mammals known from Harding County, South Dakota,  are treated in the accounts that follow. Appended is a brief discussion  of 10 additional species that may be found there. In most accounts,  specimens that have been examined (a total of 644) are listed in  telegraphic style preceding remarks; localities are arranged from north  to south in such lists. Unless otherwise noted, specimens are housed in  the Museum of Natural History. All measurements are in millimeters  (those of embryos are crown-rump lengths) and weights are given in  grams.      Order Chiroptera      ~Myotis evotis evotis~ (H. Allen, 1864)    Long-eared Myotis    _Specimens examined_ (20).--NW 1/4 sec. 15, R. 5 E, T. 22 N, 2; 5 mi. N,  2 mi. W Camp Crook, 1; 10 mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 16; 7 mi. S, 4-1/2 mi. E  Harding, 1.    The long-eared myotis is not uncommon in and around wooded buttes. The  species may be mostly limited to these areas; an individual of unknown  sex found dead in a small stream southeast of Harding (several miles  south of the East Short Pine Hills) is the only specimen not taken in  such a situation. North of Camp Crook, on the eastern edge of the Long  Pine Hills, several _M. evotis_ used an abandoned shed as a night roost  in the summer of 1970; one was captured in a bat trap set at one of the  entrances to the shed.    Females obtained on May 29 and June 17 and 19 carried single embryos  that measured 3, 14, and 15, respectively. A male young of the year  taken on August 6 was nearly of adult size. Testes of two May-taken  males measured 4 and 2, whereas those of one taken on July 17 and  another captured on August 3 measured 6.0 and 7.5, respectively.    Of seven adults collected in the period August 3 to 6, three females and  two of four males were in fresh pelage; molt was nearly completed on the  two remaining males. A male taken in mid-July was in an early stage of  molt. New pelage is pale yellowish brown in contrast to the golden brown  pelage of specimens taken in May and June.    Chiggers, _Leptotrombidium myotis_ (Ewing), were found on the ears of  one long-eared myotis.      ~Myotis leibii ciliolabrum~ (Merriam, 1886)    Small-footed Myotis    Eight males of this"]]]
