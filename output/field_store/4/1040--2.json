Kenyon Cox.          AN INTRODUCTION      For many years we, the teachers of the United States assembled in  village, city, State, and national conventions, have recited our creed  and chanted it in all keys.    [Sidenote: _Our creed_]    We believe that man is a trinity, three in one--head, heart, and hand,  one soul made manifest; we believe that this union is vital and  indissoluble, since \"what God hath joined together\" may not be rent  asunder; we believe that this three-fold man, being \"put to school\" on  earth to grow, may devise and bring to successful issue no scheme of  education that is out of harmony with the plan of the Creator.    Congratulating ourselves upon our ready and distinct utterance of this  lofty thought, we have calmly returned to our man-devised book-schools  for the acquisition of knowledge, in order to forward some plan for the  accumulation of more knowledge.    [Sidenote: _Deeds, not words, are now necessary_]    But \"wisdom lingered\"! Here and there voices were raised that would not  be silenced: \"You sang your beautiful song; what are you going to _do_  about it?\" In the words of John Stuart Mill, \"It is now time to assert  in deeds, since the power of words is well-nigh exhausted.\"    Investigators, studying this union of head and hand from the  physiological side, hurled truths at us that startled us from our  lethargy.    [Sidenote: _Physiological truths_]    Every stimulus poured into nerve cells through the avenues of the senses  tends to pass out in motor action, which causes muscular movement. In  every idea are vitally united the impression and the tendency to  expression in action. The nervous system consists of the fibres which  carry currents inward, the organs of central redirection, and the fibres  which carry them outward--sensation, direction, action. Since control  means mental direction of this involuntary discharge of energy (directed  muscular movement), control of the muscles means development of will as  well as of skill. To prevent or cut off the natural outflow of nervous  energy results in fatigue and diseased nerves. Unrestrained and  uncontrolled expenditure of nervous energy results in lawlessness and  weakened will.    Men of science said: \"These are facts about man. What account have you  made of them in your elaborate system for educating him?\"    Students of sociological and economic problems called out to us as the  teachers of men:    [Sidenote: _Labor must be respected_]    These great problems concerning the relation of labor and capital (the  brotherhood of man) will never be solved until there is greater respect  for labor; greater appreciation of the value of the products of labor;  until there is more joy to the worker in his labor, which should be the  expression through his hand, of the thought of his head, and the feeling  of his heart; until labor is seen in its true light, as service; until  the man with money as well as the man without learns through experience  to respect and appreciate labor and its products. \"We _absorb_ only so  much as we can interpret in terms of our own active experience.\"    What contributions are our schools making to the bettering of social and  industrial conditions?    Philosopher and poet--thinker and seer--send their message:        \"That life is wisest spent      Where the strong, working hand      Makes strong the working brain.\"    To create, to make something, is the instinct of divinity in humanity,  the power that crowns man as divine.        \"It is his impulse to create      Should gladden thee.\"    [Sidenote: _The will to do_]    The practical business man thunders his protest at us against the  inefficiency of the man with only the knowledge-stored brain. He says:  We must have men that can _will to do_, and then _do_ something, not  merely men that can think of things \"'twere good to do.\" Our public  schools must train men and women to go out and take their place with the  workers of the world, to do something well and effectively.    [Sidenote: _Systematic hand-training the work of to-day_]    At last we are awake, and throughout the country we are trying to heed  these calls, and to revive our own weakened thought by action, singing  our creed in deeds. Upon the foundations laid by Friedrich Froebel and  his students in the kindergarten, we are trying to build up a course in  systematic hand-training, through the primary, to intermediate and  grammar grades, and thence to manual training in the high schools.  _What_ to do and _how_ to do it has now become the practical problem of  the day. Everywhere the wide-awake primary teacher is sharing her  thought and experience with her co-workers.    For little children, the _what_ must utilize material suitable for  little fingers, and tools must be large. The finished product should  belong to the maker, or be made by him as a service rendered to others;  the result should also be worthy of keeping or giving, from the  view-points of both beauty and utility.    Another important factor is the adaptation to present public-schoolroom  conditions, and to present public-school treasury conditions.    [Sidenote: _Weaving the best hand work for primary schools_]    More thoughtful study has led to the abandonment of the old-time sewing  and fine handwork in kindergarten and primary school. In its place we  find the weaving of useful and beautiful articles, out of various  available materials, and with simple, primitive tools--allowing always  for much and varied use of the great tools, the fingers.    It is interesting to note that teachers in all parts of the country,  working independently of each other, have come to practically the same  conclusions, viz., that under present conditions, _weaving_ seems the  best basis for a systematic course in industrial work that shall train  head and heart as well as hand. It is also of great interest to remember  that the signboards along the pathway of race development, by means of  work, exchange of labor and its products, all point to this idea as the  entering gateway. Weaving is the first industry of all primitive  peoples.    [Sidenote: _This manual the result of study and experience_]    Being practically agreed as to _what_ shall be the first industrial work  in the primary school, the next great question is the _how_. With large  numbers of little children in her own schoolroom, the author of this  manual has long sought a satisfactory answer. Believing that the results  of her study and experience will be helpful to others in suggesting  possibilities, and in stimulating thought, as well as in practical  teaching and time-saving, she sends forth this little book with the  earnest hope that it may in these ways be of real service.

And all  through the journey she'd studied her _Brief Introduction to Terrestrial  Manners and Mores_ avidly. Perhaps it was a bit overinspirational in  spots, but it had facts in it, too.    So she knew that, since the natives were non-alate, she was not to take  wing on Earth. She had, however, forgotten to correlate the knowledge of  their winglessness with her own vertical habits. As a result, on leaving  the tender that had ferried her down from the Moon, she looked up  instead of right and narrowly escaped death at the jaws of a raging  groundcar that swerved out onto the field.    She recognized it as a taxi from one of the pictures in the handbook.  It was a pity, she thought sadly as she was knocked off her feet, that  all those lessons she had so carefully learned were to go to waste.    But it was only the wind of the car's passage that had thrown her down.  As she struggled to get up, hampered by her awkward native skirts, the  door of the taxi flew open. A tall young man--a Fizbian--burst out, the  soft yellowish-green down on his handsome face bristling with fright  until each feather stood out separately.    \"Miss Morfatch! Are you all right?\"    \"Just--just a little shaky,\" she murmured, brushing dirt from her rosy  leg feathers. _Too young to be Drosmig; too good-looking to be anyone  important, she thought glumly. Must be the office boy._    To her surprise, he didn't help her up. Probably it would violate some  native taboo if he did, she deduced. The handbook hadn't mentioned  anything that seemed to apply, but, after all, a little book like that  couldn't cover everything.           *       *       *       *       *    She could see the young man was embarrassed--his emerald crest was  waving to and fro.    \"I'm Stet Zarnon,\" he introduced himself awkwardly.    The Managing Editor! The handsome young employer of her girlish dreams!  But perhaps he had a wife on Fizbus--no, the Grand Editor made a point  of hiring people without families to use as a pretext for expensive  vacations on the Home Planet.    As she opened her mouth to say something brilliantly witty, to show she  was no ordinary female but a creature of spirit and fire and  intelligence, a sudden cacophony of shrill cries and explosions arose,  accompanied by bursts of light. Her feathers stood erect and she clung  to her employer with both feathered legs.    \"If these are the friendly diplomatic relations Earth and Fizbus are  supposed to be enjoying,\" she said, \"I'm not enjoying them one bit!\"    \"They're only taking pictures of you with native equipment,\" he  explained, pulling away from her. What was the matter with him? \"You're  the first Fizbian woman ever to come to Terra, you know.\"    She certainly did know--and, what was more, she had made the semi-finals  for Miss Fizbus only the year before. Perhaps he had some Terrestrial  malady he didn't want her to catch. Or could it be that in the four  years he had spent in voluntary exile on this planet, he had come to  prefer the native females? Now it was her turn to shrink from him.    He was conversing rapidly in Terran with the chattering natives who  milled about them. Although Tarb had been an honors student in Terran  back at school, she found herself unable to understand more than an  occasional word of what they said. Then she remembered that they were  not at the world capital, Ottawa, but another community, New York.  Undoubtedly they were all speaking some provincial dialect peculiar to  the locality.    And nobody at all booed in appreciation, although, she told herself  sternly, she really couldn't have expected them to. Standards of beauty  were different in different solar systems. At least they were picking up  as souvenirs some of the feathers she'd shed in her tumble, which showed  they took an interest.    Stet turned back to her. \"These are fellow-members of the press.\"    She was able to catch enough of what he said next in Terran to  understand that she was being formally introduced to the aboriginal  journalists. Although you could never call the natives attractive, with  their squat figures and curiously atrophied vestigial wings--_arms_, she  reminded herself--they were very Fizboid in appearance and, with their  winglessness cloaked, could have creditably passed for singed Fizbians.    Moreover, they seemed friendly; at any rate, the sounds they uttered  were welcoming. She began to make the three ritual _entrechats_, but  Stat stopped her. \"Just smile at them; that'll be enough.\"    It didn't seem like enough, but he was the boss.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Thank the stars we're through with that,\" he sighed, as they finally  were able to escape their confreres and get into the taxi. \"I suppose,\"  he added, wriggling inside the clumsy Terrestrial jacket which, cut to  fit over his wings, did nothing either to improve his figure or to make  him look like a native, \"it was as much of an ordeal for you as for me.\"    \"Well, I am a little bewildered by it all,\" Tarb admitted, settling  herself as comfortably as possible on the seat cushions.    \"No, don't do that!\" he cried. \"Here people don't crouch on seats. They  sit,\" he explained in a kindlier tone. \"Like this.\"    \"You mean I have to bend myself in that clumsy way?\"    He nodded. \"In public, at least.\"    \"But it's so hard on the wings. I'm losing feathers foot over claw.\"    \"Yes, but you could....\" He stopped. \"Well, anyhow, remember we have to  comply with local customs. You see, the Terrestrials have those things  called arms instead of legs. That is, they have legs, but they use them  only for walking.\"    She sighed. \"I'd read about the arms, but I had no idea the natives  would be so--so primitive as to actually use them.\"    \"Considering they had no wings, it was very clever of them to make use  of the vestigial appendages,\" he said hotly. \"If you take their physical  limitations into account, they've done a marvelous job with their little  planet. They can't fly; they have very little sense of balance; their  vision is exceedingly poor--yet, in spite of all that, they have  achieved a quite remarkable degree of civilization.\" He gestured toward  the horizontal building arrangements visible through the window. \"Why,  you could almost call those streets. As a matter of fact, the natives  do.\"    At the moment, she could take an interest in Terrestrial civilization  only as it affected her personally. \"But I'll be able to relax in the  office, won't I?\"    \"To a certain extent,\" he replied cautiously. \"You see, we have to use a  good deal of native help because--well, our facilities are limited....\"    \"Oh,\" she said.    Then she remembered that she was on Terra at least partly to demonstrate  the pluck of Fizbian femininity. Back on Fizbus, most of the _Times_  executives had been dead set against having a woman sent out as  Drosmig's assistant. But Grupe, the Grand Editor, had overruled them.  \"Time we broke with tradition,\" he had said. He'd felt she could do the  job, and, by the stars, she would justify his faith in her!    \"Sounds like rather a lark,\" she said hollowly.    Stet brightened. \"That's the girl!\" His eyes, she noticed, were emerald  shading into turquoise, like his crest. \"I certainly hope you'll like it  here. Very wise of Grupe to send a woman instead of a man, after all.  Women,\" he went on quickly, \"are so much better at working up the human  interest angle. And Drosmig is out of commission most of the time, so  it's you who'll actually be in charge of 'Helpfully Yours.'\"    She herself in charge of the column that had achieved interstellar fame  in three short years! Basically, it had been designed to give guidance,  advice and, if necessary, comfort to those Fizbians who found themselves  living on Terra, for the Fizbus _Times_ had stood for public service  from time immemorial. As Grupe had put it, \"We don't run this paper for  ourselves, Tarb, but for our readers. And the same applies to our  Terrestrial edition.\"    With the growing development of trade and cultural relations between the  two planets, the Fizbians on Earth were an ever-increasing number. But  they were not the only readers of \"Helpfully Yours.\" Reprinted in the  parent paper, it was read with edification and pleasure all over Fizbus.  Everyone wanted to learn more about the ancient and other-worldly Terran  culture.    The handbook, _A Brief Introduction to Terrestrial Manners and Mores_,  owed much of its content to \"Helpfully Yours.\" A grateful, almost  fulsome, introductory note had said so. But the column truly deserved  all the praise that had been lavished upon it by the handbook. How well  she had studied the thoughtful letters that filled it and the excellent  and well-reasoned advice--erring, if it erred at all, on the side of  overtolerance--that had been given in return. Of course, on Earth,  spiritual adjustment apparently was more important than the physical;  you could tell that from the questions that were asked. A number of the  letters had been reprinted in an appendix to the manual.         _New York_         _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_         _When in contact with Terrestrial culture, I find myself constantly       overawed and weighed down by the knowledge of my own inadequacy.
