He remained with the Cavins until 1885, then farmed for       himself. Will lives alone in Marshall, Texas, supported by a $13.00       monthly pension.      \"My folks allus belongs to the Cavins and wore their name till after  'mancipation. Pa and ma was named Freeman and Amelia Cavin and Massa  Dave fotches them to Texas from Alabama, along with ma's mother, what we  called Maria.    \"The Cavins allus thunk lots of their niggers and Grandma Maria say,  'Why shouldn't they--it was their money.' She say there was plenty  Indians here when they settled this country and they bought and traded  with them without killin' them, if they could. The Indians was poor  folks, jus' pilfer and loaf 'round all the time. The niggers was a heap  sight better off than they was, 'cause we had plenty to eat and a place  to stay.    \"Young Massa Tom was my special massa and he still lives here. Old Man  Dave seemed to think more of his niggers than anybody and we thunk lots  of our white folks. My pa was leader on the farm, and there wasn't no  overseer or driver. When pa whip a nigger he needn't go to Massa Dave,  but pa say, 'Go you way, you nigger. Freeman didn't whip you for  nothin'.' Massa Dave allus believe pa, 'cause he tells the truth.    \"One time a peddler come to our house and after supper he goes to see  'bout his pony. Pa done feed that pony fifteen ears of corn. The peddler  tell massa his pony ain't been fed nothin', and massa git mad and say,  'Be on you way iffen you gwine 'cuse my niggers of lyin'.'    \"We had good quarters"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30626"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#1)"],[1,"(http://www.pgdp.net).

During about three-fourths of the year the American Jay is an extremely  tame, noisy and even obstrusive bird in its habits. As the breeding  season approaches he suddenly becomes silent, preparing the nest in  the most secluded parts of his native forests, and exercising all his  cunning to keep it concealed. He is omniverous but is especially fond  of eggs and young birds. The Jay may be regarded as eminently injurious  though in spring he consumes a number of insects to atone for his sins  of stealing fruit and berries in autumn. He is a professional nest  robber, and other birds are as watchful of him as is a mother of her  babe. He glides through the foliage of the trees so swiftly and  noiselessly that his presence is scarcely suspected until he has  committed some depredation. The Robin is his most wary foe, and when  the Jay is found near his nest will pursue him and drive him from the  neighborhood. He is as brave as he is active, however, and dashes boldly  in pursuit of his more plainly attired neighbors who venture to intrude  upon his domain.    The Jay has a curious antipathy toward the owl, perching on trees  above it and keeping up a continual screeching. Some years ago an Ohio  gentleman was presented with a magnificent specimen of the horned owl,  which he kept for a time in a large tin cage. In favorable weather the  cage was set out of doors, when it would soon be surrounded by Jays,  much in the manner described of the Toucan, and an incessant screeching  followed, to which the owl appeared indifferent. They would venture  near enough to steal a portion of his food, the bars of his cage being  sufficiently wide apart to admit them. On one occasion, however, he  caught the tail of a Jay in his claws and left the tormentor without  his proud appendage.    The Jay remains with us throughout the year. He is one of the wildest  of our birds, the"]]]
