Y.          PREFACE      In this little book an attempt has been made to discuss the more  abundant and widely distributed butterflies of eastern North America  from the point of view of their life histories and their relations to  their surroundings. In so doing I have of course availed myself of the  written records of a host of students of butterflies, without whose  labors no such volume would be possible. Among these two names stand  out preeminent--William H. Edwards and Samuel H. Scudder. Each was the  author of a sumptuous work on American butterflies to which all later  students must refer, both for information and for inspiration. Many  others, however, have made notable contributions to our literature of  these ethereal creatures. Every seeker after a knowledge of  butterflies will soon find himself indebted to the writings of such  investigators as the Comstocks, Denton, Dickerson, Dyar, Fernald,  Fiske, Fletcher, French, Hancock, Holland, Howard, Longstaff, Newcomb,  Riley, Skinner, Wright, and many others. I am glad to express my  obligations to all of these for the assistance their records have  given in the preparation of this book.    While a vast amount of knowledge of butterflies has already been  discovered there is still more to be learned concerning them, and  throughout these pages I have attempted to indicate the more important  opportunities awaiting investigation. The day of the field naturalist  has come again and the butterflies are well worthy of careful  observations by many interested students.    The illustrations in the book require a word of credit. The eleven  color plates of adult butterflies with wings spread have been made  direct from a set of the remarkable transfers which Mr. Sherman F.  Denton has been preparing for the last quarter-century, this  particular set having been prepared especially for this book.  Transfers of this sort were used as insets in Mr. Denton's work on the  \"Moths and Butterflies of the United States,\" published in a limited  edition by J. B. Millet Company, Boston. The other plates not  reproduced from photographs are from drawings by Miss Mary E. Walker  or Mr. W. I. Beecroft. In case the photographs are not of my own  taking, credit is given beneath each. Two of my photographs have  already appeared in \"Seeing Nature First\" and are here used by  permission of its publishers, J. B. Lippincott Company.                                                                C. M. W.   STATE NORMAL SCHOOL,   Lowell, Mass.

An Introduction to Chemical Science    by R.P. Williams, A.M.,          CONTENTS        PREFACE, BY R.P. WILLIAMS  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AN INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL SCIENCE  APPENDIX  TEXTBOOK ADVERTISEMENTS THAT APPEARED IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION  INFO ABOUT THIS E-TEXT EDITION        PREFACE, BY R.P. WILLIAMS        The object held constantly in view in writing this book has been to  prepare a suitable text-book in Chemistry for the average High  School,--one that shall be simple, practical, experimental, and  inductive, rather than a cyclopaedia of chemical information.    For the accomplishment of this purpose the author has endeavored  to omit superfluous matter, and give only the most useful and  interesting experiments, facts and theories.    In calling attention, by questions, and otherwise, to the more  important phenomena to be observed and facts to be learned, the  best features of the inductive system have been utilized.  Especially is the writing of equations, which constitute the  multum in parvo of chemical knowledge, insisted upon. As soon as  the pupil has become imbued with the spirit and meaning of  chemical equations, he need have little fear of failing to  understand the rest. To this end Chapters IX., XI., and XVI.  should be studied with great care.    In the early stages of the work the equations may with advantage  be memorized, but this can soon be discontinued. Whenever symbols  are employed, pupils should be required to give the corresponding  chemical names, or, better, both names and symbols.    The classification of chemical substances into acids, bases and  salts, and the distinctions and analogies between each of these  classes, have been brought into especial prominence. The general  relationship between the three classes, and the general  principles prevailing in the preparation of each, must be fully  understood before aught but the merest smattering of chemical  science can be known.    Chapters XV.-XXI. should be mastered as a key to the subsequent  parts of the book.    The mathematical and theoretical parts of Chemistry it has been  thought best to intersperse throughout the book, placing each  where it seemed to be especially needed; in this way, it is hoped  that the tedium which pupils find in studying consecutively many  chapters of theories will be avoided, and that the arrangement  will give an occasional change from the discussion of facts and  experiments to that of principles. In these chapters additional  questions should be given, and the pupil should be particularly  encouraged to make new problems of his own, and to solve theta.    It is needless to say that this treatise is primarily designed to  be used in connection with a laboratory. Like all other text-  books on the subject, it can be studied without such an  accessory; but the author attaches very little value to the study  of Chemistry without experimental work. The required apparatus  and chemicals involve but little expense, and the directions for  experimentation are the result of several years' experience with  classes as large as are to be found in the laboratory of any  school or college in the country.    During the present year the author personally supervises the work  of more than 180 different pupils in chemistry. This enables him  not only to assure himself that the experiments of the book are  practical, but that the directions for performing them are ample.  It is found advisable to perform most of the experiments, with  full explanation, in presence of the class, before requiring the  pupils either to do the work or to recite the lesson. In the  laboratory each pupil has a locker under his table, furnished  with apparatus, as specified in the Appendix. Each has also the  author's \"Laboratory Manual,\" which contains on every left-hand  page full directions for an experiment, with observations to be  made, etc. The right-hand page is blank, and on that the pupil  makes a record of his work. These notes are examined at the time,  or subsequently, by the teacher, and the pupil is not allowed to  take the book from the laboratory; nor can he use any other book  on Chemistry while experimenting. By this means he learns to make  his own observations and inferences.    For the benefit of the science and the added interest in the  study, it is earnestly recommended that teachers encourage pupils  to fit up laboratories of their own at home. This need not at  first entail a large outlay. A small attic room with running  water, a very few chemicals, and a little apparatus, are enough  to begin with; these can be added to from time to time, as new  material is wanted. In this way the student will find his love  for science growing apace.    While endeavoring, by securing an able corps of critics, and in  all other ways possible, to reduce errors to a minimum, the  author disclaims any pretensions to a work entirely free from  mistakes, holding himself alone responsible for any shortcomings,  and trusting to the leniency of teachers and critics.    The manuscript has been read by Prof. Henry Carmichael, Ph.D., of  Boston, and to his broad and accurate scholarship, as well as to  his deep personal interest in the work, the author is indebted  for much valuable and original matter. The following persons have  generously read the proof, as a whole or in part, and made  suggestions regarding it, and to them the author would return his  thanks, as well as acknowledge his obligation: Prof. E.
