The plain  drops 2000 feet in ten miles. On a clear evening, before the sun reaches  the horizon, the rays of the sun are reflected from great sandstone  cliffs forming the walls of deep canyons that appear as crooked yellow  lines in the distance. Canyon after canyon has cut into the sloping  green plain. These canyons are roughly parallel and all open into the  canyon of the Mancos River, which forms the southern boundary of the  Mesa Verde. If the observer turns to the north he sees the arid  Montezuma Valley 2000 feet below. A few green streaks and patches in the  brown and barren low country denote streams and irrigated areas. To the  northeast beyond the low country the towering peaks of the San Miguel  and La Plata mountains rise more than 4000 feet above the vantage point  on the North Rim at 8000 feet. To the northwest, in the hazy distance 90  miles away in Utah, lie the isolated heights of the La Sal Mountains,  and 70 miles away, the Abajo Mountains (see Fig. 1).    In the thirteenth century, harassed by nomadic tribes and beset by years  of drouth, village dwelling Indians left their great cliff dwellings in  the myriad canyons of the Mesa Verde, and thus ended a period of 1300  years of occupancy. The story of those 1300 years, unfolded through  excavation and study of the dwellings along the cliffs and earlier  dwellings on the top of the Mesa, is one of the most fascinating in  ancient America. To stop destructive commercial exploitation of the  ruins, to preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy, and  to make them accessible to the public, more than 51,000 acres, including  approximately half of the Mesa, have been set aside as Mesa Verde  National Park, established in 1906. The policies of the National Park  Service provide protection, not only for the features of major interest  in each park, but for other features as well. Thus the policy in Mesa  Verde National Park is not only to preserve the many ruins, but also the  wildlife and plants.    Five considerations prompted me to undertake a study of the mammals of  Mesa Verde National Park: First, the relative lack of disturbance;  second, the interesting position, zoogeographically, of the Mesa that  extends as a spur of higher land from the mountains of southwestern  Colorado and that is almost surrounded by arid country typical of much  of the Southwest; third, the discovery in the Park of _Microtus  mexicanus_, a species of the Southwest until then not known from  Colorado; fourth, the co-operative spirit of the personnel at the Park  when I visited there in 1955; and finally, the possibility of making a  contribution not only to our knowledge of mammals, but to the  interpretive program of the Park Service.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map of the \"four corners\" region showing the  position of Mesa Verde National Park (in black) relative to the mass of  the Southern Rocky Mountains above 8000 feet elevation (indicated by  stippled border) to the northeast in Colorado, and the positions of  other isolated mountains in the region.]    A Faculty Research Grant from The University of Kansas provided some  secretarial help and field expenses for August and early September,  1956, when my wife, Justine, and I spent our vacation enjoyably  collecting and studying animals in the Park. The co-operation of Dr. E.  Raymond Hall is greatly appreciated; a grant to him from the American  Heart Association provided field expenses for work by Mr. J.R. Alcorn,  collector for The University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, in  1957.    Mr. Harold R. Shepherd of Mancos, Colorado (Senior Game Biologist for  the State of Colorado, Department of Game and Fish), provided advice in  the field, helped in identifying plants, and saved specimens of rodents  (in 1958 and 1959) taken in his studies of the effect of rodents on  browse utilized by deer. Mr. J.D. Hart, Assistant Director of the  Department of Game and Fish, issued a letter of authority to collect in  Colorado; and Superintendent O.W. Carlson approved my appointment as a  collaborator. Mr. \"Don\" Watson, then Park Archeologist, and Mrs. Jean M.  Pinkley, now Park Archeologist, assisted us in 1956, and since then have  provided advice and assistance, and have reviewed the manuscript of this  report.    Geologically, the Mesa Verde is the northern edge of a Cretaceous,  coal-bearing, sandstone deposit called the Mesaverde group, which dips  beneath the San Juan Basin of New Mexico. An abrupt retreating  escarpment commonly forms on arid plateaus underlain by horizontal rocks  of unequal strength, and characterizes the borders of mesas. Such an  escarpment forms the North Rim of the Mesa Verde. However, the dip of  the rocks has channelled drainage southward and erosion has cut  numerous, deep, parallel-sided canyons rather than a simple, retreating  escarpment. The Mesa Verde therefore is, technically speaking, a cuesta  rather than a mesa. The remnants of the plateau left between the canyons  are also (and again incorrectly in the technical sense) called mesas;  Chapin Mesa and Wetherill Mesa are examples.    Climatically, the Mesa Verde is arid; precipitation averaged 18.41  inches per year for a period of 37 years. Precipitation may be scattered  through the year, and more important, may be erratic from month to month  and from year to year. In addition to low precipitation and periods of  drouth, a great amount of sunshine, and thin, well-drained soils on all  but the more sheltered parts of the Mesa favor vegetation that requires  neither great amounts of, nor a continuous supply of, water.    The vegetation of the Mesa is illustrated in Plates 1 and 2, and  consists predominantly of pinyon pine, _Pinus edulis_ Engelm., and Utah  juniper, _Juniperus osteosperma_ (Torr.) Little. More sheltered areas  along the North Rim and in most of the canyons support scattered small  stands of Douglas fir, _Pseudotsuga menziesii_ (Merb.) Franco. These  are the \"spruce trees\" of Spruce Tree Canyon. An occasional ponderosa  pine, _Pinus ponderosa_ Laws., represents a vestige of more montane  species of plants and animals in the Park. The dusky grouse,  _Dendragapus obscurus_ (Say), occurs along the North Rim in  oak-chaparral, and is one of the few montane species of birds; several  montane mammals are discussed later. The vegetation of the Mesa Verde  has not changed appreciably in the last thousand years. The tree rings  of 13 centuries show that Douglas fir has grown essentially as it does  now, varying with precipitation from year to year, and periodically  suffering from drouth (Schulman, 1946:18). Surface ruins yield mostly  pinyon and juniper; cave ruins yield more Douglas fir than surface  ruins; and \"only rarely does yellow pine [_Pinus ponderosa_] occur in  the ruins, indicating that then, as now, this tree grew only in the  northern and higher parts of the Mesa Verde, remote from most of the  ruins\" (Getty, 1935:21).    Not all areas within the Park are undisturbed. The rights of way of  roads are kept clear, as are campgrounds and other facilities in the  area of headquarters. Part of the Mancos Valley within the Park is  privately owned and is still in agricultural use. Cattle from land  belonging to the Ute Indians wander into the Park from the Mancos Canyon  along the floor of the canyon above the mouth of Weber Canyon. In  addition to the pasture near headquarters, Prater Canyon below a fence  across the canyon above Middle Well is used to pasture horses used by  visitors to the Park and belonging to the pack and saddle concessioner.  In 1956, the floor of Long Canyon was grazed by stock belonging to Utes,  and horses ranged freely onto Wetherill Mesa as far as the North Rim.  Occasionally livestock enter the floor of other canyons, for example  Navajo, Soda, Prater, Morfield, and Waters canyons, owing to inadequate  fencing, or no fencing.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.

EATON, JR., AND PEGGY LOU STEWART    INTRODUCTION      A slab of shale obtained in 1955 by Mr. Russell R. Camp from a  Pennsylvanian lagoon-deposit in Anderson County, Kansas, has yielded in  the laboratory a skeleton of the small amphibian _Hesperoherpeton  garnettense_ Peabody (1958). This skeleton provides new and surprising  information not available from the holotype, No. 9976 K. U., which  consisted only of a scapulocoracoid, neural arch, and rib fragment. The  new specimen, No. 10295 K. U., is of the same size and stage of  development as the holotype and it is thought that both individuals are  adults.    The quarry, University of Kansas Museum of Natural History Locality KAN  1/D, is approximately six miles northwest of Garnett, Anderson County,  Kansas, in Sec. 5, T. 19S, R. 19E, 200 yards southwest of the place  where _Petrolacosaurus kansensis_ Lane was obtained (see Peabody,  1952). The Rock Lake shale, deposited under alternately marine and  freshwater lagoon conditions, is a thin member of the Stanton limestone  formation, Lansing group, Missourian series, and thus is in the lower  part of the Upper Pennsylvanian.    Peabody (1958) placed _Hesperoherpeton_ in the order Anthracosauria,  suborder Embolomeri, family Cricotidae. Study of the second and more  complete specimen reveals that _Hesperoherpeton_ is unlike the known  Embolomeri in many important features. The limbs and braincase are more  primitive than those so far described in any amphibian. The vertebrae  are comparable to those of Ichthyostegalia (Jarvik, 1952), as well as  to those of Embolomeri. The forelimb is transitional between the  pectoral fin of Rhipidistia and the limb of early Amphibia. The pattern  of the bones of the forelimb closely resembles, but is simpler than,  that of the hypothetical transitional type suggested by Eaton (1951).  The foot seemingly had only four short digits. The hind limb is not  known.    The new skeleton of _Hesperoherpeton_ lies in an oblong block of limy  shale measuring approximately 100 x 60 mm. After preparation of the  entire lower surface, the exposed bones and matrix were embedded in  Bioplastic, in a layer thin enough for visibility but giving firm  support. Then the specimen was inverted and the matrix removed from the  opposite side; this has not been covered with Bioplastic. The bones lie  in great disorder, except that some parts of the roof of the skull are  associated, and the middle section of the vertebral column is  approximately in place. The bones of the left forelimb are close  together but not in a natural position. The tail, pelvis, hind limbs  and right forelimb are missing. Nearly all the bones present are  broken, distorted by crushing, incomplete and scattered out of place,  probably by the action of currents. The complete skeleton, in life,  probably measured between 150 and 200 mm. in length.    The specimen was studied at the Museum of Natural History, University  of Kansas, with the help of a grant from the National Science  Foundation, number NSF-G8624. The specimen was discovered in the slab  by Miss Sharon K. Moriarty, and was further cleaned by the authors. Mr.  Merton C. Bowman assisted with the illustrations. We are indebted to  Dr. Robert W. Wilson for critical comments.      SKULL    _Dorsal Aspect_ (Figs. 1, 2)    In reconstruction, the skull measures approximately 8.0 mm.  dorsoventrally at the posterior end. The height diminishes anteriorly  to about 1.5 mm. at the premaxillary. The length is about 15.5 mm. in  the median line, or 24.0 mm. to the tip of the tabular, and the width  about 16.0 mm. posteriorly. The snout is blunt, continuing about 1-2  mm. anterior to the external nares. Each of the tabulars has a slender  posterior process 5.0 mm. long, which probably met the supracleithrum;  the intertabular space is about 8.5 mm. wide. The orbits are  approximately 5.5 mm. in diameter and extend from the maxillary to  within about 3.0 mm. of the midline dorsally. The pineal opening is 1.8  mm. anterior to the occipital margin of the skull.    Reduction of bones at the back of the skull seems to have eliminated  any dermal elements posterior to the squamosal, while enlargement of  the orbit has removed most of the postorbital series, leaving the  squamosal as the only cheekbone. There is apparently no jugal or  postfrontal.    The squamosal of _Acanthostega_ (Jarvik, 1952) is articulated under the  tabular and reaches forward and down, much as if it were an opercular  in reversed position. Internally, it must lie against the otic capsule  below the tabular, partially concealing the stapes. The bone that we  suppose to be the squamosal of _H. garnettense_ is of similar shape, of  about the same size and has internally an articular surface at one  corner, bounded by a pair of ridges in the shape of a V. This articular  surface probably fitted on a lateral process extending from the roof of  the neurocranium, over the front of the otic capsule.    The premaxillary extends posterolaterally to a distance 5.5 mm. from  the midline and attains a width at its broadest point of about 1.5 mm.  The posterior edge is slightly concave and in part forms the anterior  border of the naris.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Skull,  dorsal view. Postorbital processes of the neurocranium are shown in  dotted outline. KU 10295, x 4.]    The nasal is triangular and, with the lacrimal, forms the medial border  of the naris. The length of the medial side of the nasal bone is  approximately 5.0 mm., the transverse width is 3.8 mm., and the extent  of the posterolateral border is 5.5 mm.    The maxillary meets the premaxillary lateral to the naris, borders the  naris posteroventrally, and continues posteriorly beneath the orbit, of  which it forms the external border. The maxillary is about 8.5 mm.  long, and immediately anterior to the orbit has a maximum width of 1.3  mm.    The lacrimal fills the remaining rim of the narial opening between the  nasal and maxillary, and extends to the anterior edge of the orbit. The  length, from naris to orbit, is 4.2 mm.; the width ranges from 1.0 mm.  anteriorly to 2.5 mm. posteriorly.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Skull,  lateral view, showing relatively large orbit and absence of smaller  circumorbital bones. KU 10295, x 4.]    The external naris is approximately 1.0 mm. in diameter. It is slightly  anterodorsal to the internal naris and 4.0 mm. lateral to the midline.    The dorsal margin of the orbit appears to be formed by the frontal. The  anterior part of this margin, however, may be formed by a prefrontal,  which is not clearly set off by a suture. The frontal extends 3.8 mm.  in the midline, and anteriorly and laterally borders the nasal and  lacrimal, respectively. A faint pattern of pitting radiates on the  surface from the center of ossification of the frontal. There is also a  pit indicating the presence of a supraorbital sensory pore.    The parietal bones enclose the pineal opening, approximately 2.5 mm.  posterior to the suture with the frontal. The foramen is about 0.5 mm.  in diameter. Laterally the parietal meets the medial angle of the  postorbital and the medial border of the supratemporal. No bone of this  animal shows the deep pitting and heavy ornamentation characteristic of  many primitive Amphibia.    The postorbital meets the anterolateral corner of the parietal for a  distance of 0.5 mm., the anterior edge bordering the frontal bone and  the orbit for a combined distance of about 3.0 mm. The lateral margin  is slightly convex, and is probably interrupted behind by the anterior  point of the tabular. Medially, the concave margin of the postorbital  meets the supratemporal for about 3.5 mm.    The supratemporal is thus wedge-shaped and located between the parietal  and the postorbital. The posterior edge of the supratemporal protrudes  as a convex border slightly behind the end of the parietal, and  measures 3.0 mm. around the curve to the parietal suture.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. A, left  squamosal, internal surface. B, left squamosal, external surface. C,  right tabular internal surface. D, right tabular, external surface. KU  10295, all x 4.]    The squamosal (Fig. 3 A, B) is a large, somewhat rectangular bone  extending from the back of the orbit to the posterior extremity of the  cheek. It outlines almost entirely the posterior border of the orbit,  the ventrolateral portion of the cheek region, and the lateral border  of the top of the skull behind the orbit. Dorsally, the squamosal meets  the anterior half of the tabular and the lateral border of the  supratemporal. Near the anteroventral edge of the squamosal there is a  small pit, probably related to a postorbital sensory pore in the skin.    The tabular (Fig. 3 C, D) is pointed anteriorly, where it probably fits  against the lateroposterior edge of the postorbital. The dorsal part of  the bone flares out and down, forming a small otic notch at a point  halfway back. Posteriorly, the flange attains a dorsoventral width of  2.0 mm. at the edge of the notch.
