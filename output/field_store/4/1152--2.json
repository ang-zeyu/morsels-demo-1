[Illustration]          LOUISIANA BEEF CATTLE      The wealth-producing possibilities of cattle-raising are written into  the history, literature and art of every race; and with every  nationality riches have always been counted in cattle and corn.    We find cattle mentioned in the earliest known records of the Hebrews,  Chaldeans and Hindus, and carved on the monuments of Egypt, thousands of  years before the Christian era.    Among the primitive peoples wealth was, and still is, measured by the  size of the cattle herds, whether it be the reindeer of the frigid  North, the camel of the Great Sahara, or herds of whatsoever kind that  are found in every land and in every clime.    The earliest known money, in Ancient Greece, was the image of the ox  stamped on metal; and the Latin word _pecunia_ and our own English  \"pecuniary\" are derived from _pecus_--cattle.    Although known to the Eastern Hemisphere since the dawn of history,  cattle are not native to the Western Hemisphere, but were introduced  into America during the sixteenth century.    Cortez, Ponce de Leon, De Soto and the other _conquistadores_ from Old  Madrid, who sailed the seas in quest of gold, brought with them to the  New World the monarchs of the bull ring, and introduced the national  sport of Spain into the colonies founded in Peru, Mexico, Florida and  Louisiana.    The long-horned, half-wild herds encountered by the pioneers, and by the  \"Forty-niners,\" who three centuries later trekked across the continent  in quest of gold in California, were descendants of the bull pens of  Mexico City, St. Augustine and New Orleans.    A different type of cattle was brought over to Jamestown, the first  English colony, in the seventeenth century; these were strictly  utilitarian, designed for the triple service of enriching the larder  with dairy products, supplementing the abundant meat supply of buffalo,  deer and other game and providing the ox as the draft animal.    The pioneers, striking out from the Atlantic seaboard, carried with them  their domestic cattle, which were introduced and fostered wherever  settlements were made in their progress across the continent.    It was not until after the Revolutionary War that wealthy planters of  Virginia imported Herefords from England, Jerseys from the Isle of  Jersey, and the flower of other Old World herds.    Even then, extensive breeding of high-grade animals languished for  years, owing to the unprogressive farming methods; and at a later period  on account of the dominancy of the Western cattle ranges.    The public domain of the West and Southwest, owing to the vast areas of  grazing land which cost the cattlemen nothing, became the controlling  factor in the American cattle industry, reaching its climax about 1880.    Subsequently these great feeding grounds were invaded by the  sheep-grower, whose flocks destroyed the pastures and drove out the  cattle wherever they appeared.    The death knell of the national cattle range was sounded by the United  States Government in throwing open the public lands to settlers.    During the romantic period of the cattle outfit--the cowboy with his  bucking broncho, lariat and six-shooter--many of the important cities  and towns of today came into existence as humble adjuncts of the live  stock industry.    There are men living today who have witnessed the beginning, the rise,  and almost the extinction, of the Western cattle range.    A complete revolution has been brought about in the cattle industry  within a lifetime. The change has been a rapid one from the free range  to the fenced pasture; the open ranges turned into farms and  settlements.    With the advent of changed conditions, the rancher of restricted  territory and reduced herds ceased to be an important factor in directly  supplying the market, as he was forced to utilize the land that was not  desirable for homesteaders, and the pasturage being insufficient to  suitably fatten stock, he was compelled to ship his cattle to the  feeders of the Middle West to prepare them for market.    Meanwhile, the Middle West, or corn-belt states, being unable to raise  cattle in an economical way, developed into a feeding station, where  young cattle from the Western ranges were shipped to be fattened and  prepared for the market.    With the decrease of range cattle, year by year, fewer Western beeves  reach the corn belt to be finished and made ready for market.    The early settlers of Southern Louisiana raised cattle after the fashion  that prevailed on the plains of Texas; that is, great herds without care  or attention of any kind increased and multiplied and were annually  rounded up and marketed; the returns were virtually all profit, as the  cattle found their sustenance entirely in the luxuriant natural  pasturage.    With the change of conditions in the cattle-growing world, Louisiana  began the improvement of its herds, so that today there are thousands  of highly bred cattle in the state, equal to the best that can be found  anywhere.    In a consideration of any branch of the live stock industry, a review of  the world-wide conditions becomes necessary to establish a standard of  comparison between the industry in a given locality as against all other  localities, and such a review at the present time shows an international  shortage of beef cattle that even threatens famine.    The day of nondescript cattle of inferior quality is rapidly passing.  Through breeding, they are being steadily supplanted by higher grade,  perfectly developed animals which yield the proper proportions of lean  and fat, whose meat is tender, nutritious and palatable.    The Old World breeds have been improved and perfected, through the skill  of the American grower, until American stock has become the standard of  the whole world, from the standpoint of excellence in every particular.    There are a multitude of reasons why it will never be possible for the  growers of the Eastern Hemisphere, with the exception of Great Britain  and the Scandinavian countries, to successfully compete with the United  States in bringing the standard of their beef cattle up to the high  point already attained in this country.    No longer ago than ten years, cattle were not acceptable as collateral  except by banks in the Western cattle centers.    Today, cattle are standard collateral for loans, approved by the  Treasury of the United States Government and acceptable everywhere, as  cattle are as good as gold all over the world; and a cattle enterprise  managed with ability and integrity is the safest business known.    There are diseases to which cattle are subject; but these, like the  diseases to which mankind is subject, are now controlled by science, and  can be quickly eradicated, even though a foothold is once gained; and  that a foothold should be gained at all is as much beyond the bounds of  reason as that the cities of New York and Chicago should, in this  advanced age, be devastated by a scourge of cholera, smallpox, yellow  fever, or what not.    According to official estimates of the United States Government, in 1910  there were 41,178,000 head of beef cattle in the United States, having a  value of $785,261,000, while on January 1, 1917, there were 40,849,000  head of beef cattle, having a value of $1,465,786,000; a decrease in  supply, but an increase in value, within seven years, of 86.66 per cent.    In addition to superior natural conditions, the United States, on  account of the great distance to other countries where cattle can be  raised successfully, is protected against competition, at all times and  under all conditions.    The United States for a quarter of a century was the world's greatest  export nation, and this trade has fallen off only in recent times,  because of the shortage at home.    Our export business well illustrates the changing conditions in the  cattle industry, and the record of live cattle exported from Chicago is  a notable example, namely:                                    Cattle    Exports in 1905               321,301    Exports in 1912                23,006    Exports in 1913                   260    Exports in 1914                   182    This table shows that the export trade was virtually extinct a year  before the European War began; and if revived, it will be because of  exorbitant prices brought about by the abnormal European demand, due to  the depletion of the cattle herds abroad.    Official statistics show that prior to the European War 90.55 per cent  of all the European cattle were within the boundaries of the  now-belligerent countries.    The records at that time, covering both beef cattle and dairy-herds,  were as follows:      Russia                        36,237,000    Germany                       20,944,000    Austria-Hungary               17,787,883    France                        12,286,849    United Kingdom                12,030,789    Turkey                         6,726,000    Italy                          6,198,861    Rumania                        2,667,000    Belgium                        1,831,000    Even prior to the war, the world-supply of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36669"],[0,"Knitting, Crochet, and Netting, with Twelve Illustrations (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive)            Transcriber's Note    The illustrations were originally located after the table of contents.

The 1st stitch of every row should be slipped.    To make round after casting on 3 pins with the 4th pin, knit the 1st     stitch cast on.    _In purling a row_, the wool should be in front of the pin. When there     are purl and plain stitches in a row, bring the cotton forward to     purl, and pass it back before knitting the plain stitch.    _To knit 3 together_--Slip a stitch, knit 2 together, turn the slipped     stitch over them, leaving but 1 stitch.    _A slipped stitch_ should always be taken off the purl way.    _To purl_, is to put the pin the contrary way to knitting plain; in     knitting, the pin is put up the stitch, in purling it is put down.    When this mark (*) occurs in a row, the stitches before it are not to be     repeated in the row, being merely the edge stitches to prevent the     work from decreasing; thus, when knit 3 together is in a row, the row     generally begins with knit 2 together, and ends the same.    _The stitch over_ in many of the patterns, is always knitted as the 1st     stitch, as many patterns end with make 1, it could not be done     without this stitch.    Many ladies in working a pattern, copy on cards each row separately;     this prevents confusing one row with another.    The stitches between the mark, thus (knit 2 together 3 times) are     worked, knit 2 together, knit 2 together, knit 2 together; this     prevents useless repetition.    The pins and meshes are all gauged by the standard or wire-drawer's     gauge.    _To raise stitches_--Put the pin in the selvedge or side of the     knitting, put the wool round the pin as in knitting, and bring it     through, so as to form a stitch.    _To make a stitch_--Bring the wool forward between the needles.
