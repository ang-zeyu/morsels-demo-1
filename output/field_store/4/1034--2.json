MODERN MARRIAGE      I      THE MUTUAL DISSATISFACTION OF THE SEXES      'The shadow of marriage waits, resolute and awful, at the    cross-roads.' --R. L. STEVENSON.      Ever since the time, nineteen years ago, when Mrs Mona Caird attacked  the institution of matrimony in the _Westminster Review_ and led the way  for the great discussion on 'Is Marriage a Failure?' in the _Daily  Telegraph_--marriage has been the hardy perennial of newspaper  correspondence, and an unfailing resource to worried sub-editors. When  seasons are slack and silly, the humblest member of the staff has but to  turn out a column on this subject, and whether it be a serious  dissertation on 'The Perfections of Polygamy' or a banal discussion on  'Should husbands have tea at home?' it will inevitably achieve the  desired result, and fill the spare columns of the papers with letters  for weeks to come. People are always interested in matrimony, whether  from the objective or subjective point of view, and that is my excuse  for perpetrating yet another book on this well-worn, but ever fertile  topic.    Marriage indeed seems to be in the air more than ever in this year of  grace; everywhere it is discussed, and very few people seem to have a  good word to say for it. The most superficial observer must have noticed  that there is being gradually built up in the community a growing dread  of the conjugal bond, especially among men; and a condition of  discontent and unrest among married people, particularly women.

How to make pure food, better food and to economize on the cost of same  is just now taxing the attention and ingenuity of domestic science  teachers and food experts generally. The average housewife is intensely  interested in the result of these findings, and must keep in touch with  them to keep up with the times and run her home in an intelligent and  economical as well as healthful routine.    The eternal feminine question is, \"What shall we have for dinner  to-day?\" It is not always the easiest thing in the world to think of a  seasonable menu, nor to determine just the right combination that will  furnish a meal appetizing and well-balanced in food values. Furthermore,  both the expense and the amount of work entailed in preparation must be  considered.    This Cook Book is especially designed to meet just that pressing daily  need of the housewife. It presents for her guidance a menu for every  Sunday dinner in the year; it suggests dishes which are seasonable as  well as practical; it tells in a simple, intelligent manner just how  these dishes can be made in the most wholesome and economical form; and  the recipes have all been especially made for this book and tested by  that eminent expert, Mrs. Elizabeth O. Hiller.    The title of \"52 Sunday Dinners\" has been given the book because Sunday  dinners as a rule are a little more elaborate than the other dinners of  the week, but from these menus may be gleaned helpful hints for daily  use.    While climatic conditions differ somewhat in various sections of the  country, we have tried to approximate the general average, so that the  suggestions might be as valuable to the housewife in New England as to  the housewife in the West or South, or vice versa.    Simplicity, economy and wholesomeness have been given preferred  attention in the preparation of these recipes, many of which are here  presented for the first time.    In the interest of health and economy a number of the recipes suggest  the use of Cottolene--a frying and shortening medium of unquestioned  purity--in place of butter or lard. Cottolene is a vegetable shortening,  pure in source and manufactured amid cleanly favorable surroundings. It  is no new, untried experiment, having been used by domestic science  experts and thousands of housewives for nearly twenty years; to them  Cottolene for shortening and frying is \"equal to butter at half the  price, better and more healthful than lard--and more economical than  either.\" We, therefore, offer no apologies for the small proportion of  recipes specifying the use of Cottolene, and suggest that a trial will  convince any housewife that Cottolene makes better food than either  butter or lard, and is preferable from the standpoints of efficiency,  economy and healthfulness.    We commend this book to your critical inspection and test, believing you  will find it convenient, helpful, unique and pointing the way to better  and more economical living.              THE N. K. FAIRBANK COMPANY.          For All Shortening and Frying Use COTTOLENE      YEARS ago nothing but butter or lard were used for shortening and  frying; to-day the visible supply of these two products is insufficient  to supply the demand, taking into consideration the amount of butter  required for table use. Furthermore, as the demand increased it outgrew  the supply of butter and lard, with the result that prices were  materially advanced; and, incidentally, the quality has been lowered.  Naturally, under such conditions scores of substitutes have been offered  as shortening and frying mediums--some meritorious, but mostly inferior.    Cottolene is not offered the housewife as a cheap imitation of either  butter or lard, but as a vegetable product which is superior to either  for cooking purposes. Because it happens to be about half the price of  butter, or less, is but an additional reason, from a purely economical  standpoint, for its use. The main argument for the use of Cottolene is  the purity of its ingredients and the wholesomeness of the food prepared  with it.    There isn't an ounce of hog fat in Cottolene, and from cottonfield to  kitchen human hands never touch the product. It is pure and absolutely  free from taint or contamination from source to consumer. Packed in our  patent, air-tight tin pails, Cottolene reaches you as fresh as the day  it was made. Lard and butter are sold in bulk, and do not have this  protection.    Cottolene is always uniform in quality, and because of its freedom from  moisture it goes one-third farther than butter or lard, both of which  contain about 20% of water. It is much more economical than lard; about  50% more so than butter.    Cottolene contains no salt, and is richer in shortening properties than  either butter or lard. Two-thirds of a pound of Cottolene will give  better results than a pound of either butter or lard.    Because Cottolene is made from sweet and pure oils, refined by our own  special process, it makes food more digestible. Its use insures light,  flaky pie-crust; it makes deliciously crisp, tender doughnuts; for  cake-making it creams up beautifully and gives results equal to the best  cooking butter; muffins, fritters, shortcake and all other pastry are  best when made with Cottolene; it makes food light and rich, but never  greasy. Cottolene heats to a higher temperature than butter or lard, and  cooks so quickly the fat has no chance to soak in.    You can fry fish in Cottolene and use the remaining fat for frying  potatoes or other food. The odor of fish will not be imparted to the  other food fried in the fat. Cottolene is just as pure and healthful as  olive oil, and is unqualifiedly recommended by leading physicians,  domestic science authorities and culinary experts as wholesome,  digestible and economical. The use of Cottolene in your frying and  shortening will both save you money and give you better results.          HOW TO USE COTTOLENE      The General Care of Cottolene    Exercise the same care and judgment with Cottolene as you would with  butter, lard or olive oil; keep it in a moderately cool place when not  in use, just as you would butter--so that its best qualities may be  preserved.    Moreover, just because you occasionally buy strong butter or rancid lard  which your grocer has kept in too warm a place, you do not denounce all  butter or lard and give up their use; neither would it be fair to  condemn Cottolene simply because your grocer may not have kept it  properly. No fat will keep sweet indefinitely without proper care.      The Use of Cottolene for Shortening    Of course, the recipes in this book indicate the exact amount of  Cottolene to be used. In your other recipes, however, a general, _and  important_, rule for the use of Cottolene is:    =Use one-third less Cottolene than the amount of butter or lard given in  your recipe.=    For cake-baking, cream the Cottolene as you would butter, adding a  little salt; _Cottolene contains no salt_. For other pastry handle  exactly the same as directed for either butter or lard, using one-third  less.      The Use of Cottolene in Frying    In _sauteing_, _browning_ or \"_shallow frying_\" (as it is sometimes  called) use only enough Cottolene to grease the pan. The Cottolene  should be put into the pan _while cold_ and, after the bottom of the pan  is once covered with the melted Cottolene, more can be added as desired.  Add more fat when you turn the food.    Cottolene can be heated to a much higher temperature without burning  than either butter or lard, but--unless allowed to heat gradually--the  Cottolene may burn and throw out an odor, just as would any other  cooking-fat.    For _deep frying_, have Cottolene at least deep enough to cover, or  float, the article being fried, heating slowly. For uncooked mixtures,  such as doughnuts, fritters, etc., test with one-inch cubes of stale  bread. The cubes of bread should brown a golden brown in one minute; or  test with a bit of dough, which should rise at once to the top with some  sputtering. Make this test always,--never trust your eye. The fat should  be kept at an even temperature. For cooked mixtures, such as croquettes,  fish balls, etc., the cube of bread should brown a golden brown in 40  seconds.    Uncooked fish and meat are better when covered with bread crumbs,"]]]
