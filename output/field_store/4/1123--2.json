DUELLMAN      At the time of completing my study of the genus _Leptodeira_ (1958) I  had seen no specimens of _Leptodeira discolor_, a species described by  Guenther in 1860 and subsequently referred to the genus _Hypsiglena_ by  Cope (1887), Boulenger (1894), and Mocquard (1908), and to the genus  _Pseudoleptodeira_ by Taylor (1938). Guenther's description was based on  two syntypes (British Museum of Natural History numbers 1946.1.23.67  and 68) collected in Oaxaca, Mexico, by Auguste Salle. Information  concerning the scutellation and coloration of the syntypes was provided  by J. C. Battersby; in my revisionary study (_op. cit._) this  information was included in a short discussion of the species, which  was referred to _incerta sedis_ until specimens could be examined and  the relationships of the species determined.    Through the courtesy of John M. Legler of the Museum of Natural History,  University of Kansas, I have been able to study a specimen of  _Leptodeira discolor_ obtained six miles southeast of Tamazulapam,  Oaxaca, Mexico, by J. R. Alcorn on June 22, 1955. Superficial  examination of the external characters of this snake shows a striking  resemblance to _Leptodeira_. The specimen has a vertical pupil, divided  anal, 21 scale rows, and two apical pits. The enlarged posterior  maxillary teeth are without a trace of a groove. Examination of the  hemipenis revealed that the organ was bifurcate and had a forked sulcus;  these penial characteristics are diagnostic of the subfamily  Xenodontinae and not the subfamily Colubrinae that includes the genera  _Hypsiglena_ and _Leptodeira_.    Examination of all available xenodontine genera indicates that this  snake belongs to a heretofore unnamed genus. In recognition of the  mental torment customarily suffered by workers attempting to ascertain  the relationships of the many genera of colubrid snakes, I propose the  generic name          _Tantalophis_, new genus         _Leptodeira_ (in part), Guenther, Proc.

London, pp. 317-318, 1860.         _Diagnosis._--A xenodontine colubrid snake having a bifurcate       hemipenis with a forked sulcus spermaticus, many longitudinal folds       on basal portion, and small spines and calyces on distal part; 12       or 13 maxillary teeth followed by short diastema and two somewhat       enlarged maxillary teeth lacking grooves; small parotid gland;       normal colubrid skull; no hypapophyses on posterior vertebrae;       elliptical pupils; two apical pits; smooth scales; normal colubrid       head shields; divided anal; paired caudals.         The generic name comes from the Greek Tantalos, a mythological       character symbolic of eternal torment, and from the Greek ophis       for snake.          _Tantalophis discolor_ (Guenther) New comb.         The synonymy for the species is indicated in the account of the       genus. The description below of the species is based on an adult       male from 6 miles southeast of Tamazulapam, Oaxaca, Mexico       (University of Kansas Museum of Natural History No. 40143).         _Scutellation._--Head shields normal; upper labials 7-7 (third and       fourth entering orbit); lower labials 9-9 (1-4 in contact with       anterior chin-shield, 4 and 5 in contact with posterior       chin-shield); preoculars 1-1 and not in contact with frontal;       postoculars 2-2; temporals 1-2-3, 1-2-3; nasals divided by a       distinct groove below nostril and faint groove above; portion of       rostral visible from above, one-third length of internasals;       internasals pentagonal and one-half as long as prefrontals;       parietal suture approximately as long as frontal; ventrals 178;       anal divided; caudals 80. Scales in 21 rows at midbody and showing       the following reduction:                2 + 3 (130)         8 + 9 (162)        21  ---------------  19  --------------  17 (178)              2 + 3 (130)         8 + 9 (152)         _Coloration._--Dorsal ground-color light brown and extending onto       edges of ventrals; transverse body blotches numbering 50, each       1-1/2 to 3 scales long and separated by light interspaces 1-1/2 to       2 scales long; blotches brownish black and extending onto second       scale row; lateral intercalary spots forming dark smudges on rows 1       and 2. Top of head black, flecked with tan; nape cream, followed by       dark band six scales long; dark nape stripe from posterior edges of       parietals to first dark body band. Venter cream-tan; throat and       labials cream; posterior margins of all upper labials and of lower       labials 1-3 black-edged (Figure 1).         _Size and Proportions._--Head and body 312 mm. long; tail 118 mm.,       amounting to 37.8 per cent of length of head and body.         _Variation._--Data on the syntypes of _Leptodeira discolor_       furnished by J. C. Battersby give some indication of the variation       in the species. Both are males, and they have 175 and 180 ventrals,       88 and 89 caudals, 1 preocular, 2 postoculars, 1-2-3 temporals, 7       and 8 upper labials, 9 lower labials. They have body lengths of       365 and 402 mm., total lengths of 509 and 555 mm., tail/body ratios       of 38.0 and 39.4. They have 51 and 54 dark blotches on the body.         [Illustration: Fig. 1. Dorsal and lateral views of the head of       _Tantalophis discolor_ (Guenther). (KU No. 40143). x 7.]         _Skull._--The skull is typically colubrid and shows no       modifications. The quadrate has both a median and a lateral       depression, forming a strong lateral flange on the anterior edge;       the columellar process is elliptical, and the supra-columellar       crest is robust. The posteroinferior vomerine process extends       directly posteriorly and then angles sharply posterodorsally,       enclosing an elliptical vomerine fenestra. The lateral processes of       the premaxillary are slightly pointed; the median spine is       relatively thin and high. The pterygoids bear 23 and 21 teeth that       decrease in size posteriorly; the transpalatine articulating       process of the pterygoid is rounded, not robust; the lateral crest       is high and moderately robust; the depression in the ventral       surface of the pterygoid is moderate. There are 12 and 13 maxillary       teeth that increase in size posteriorly; these are followed by a       short diastema and two larger, solid teeth. The prediastemal teeth       are slightly curved and slender. The maxillary is laterally       compressed; the posterior knob is not robust; there is one foramen       in the lateral face of the bone (Figure 2). The 10 palatine teeth       are almost uniform in size; the dentary bears 19 teeth that       decrease in size posteriorly.         [Illustration: Fig. 2. Lateral view of the left maxillary of       _Tantalophis discolor_ (Guenther). (KU No. 40143). x 17.]         A thin and otherwise small parotid gland or \"venom sac\" extends       posteriorly from beneath the eye to about the angle of the jaw; a       minute duct connects with the anteromedian surface and extends to       the fleshy part of the mouth at the posterior end of the maxillary       (Figure 3).         [Illustration: Fig. 3. Lateral view of the head of _Tantalophis       discolor_ (Guenther), showing the position and relative size of the       parotid gland. (KU No. 40143). x 3.]         _Hemipenis._--In _situ_ the hemipenis extends to the posterior edge       of the thirteenth caudal. The unforked part of the organ is       bedecked with numerous heavy longitudinal folds alternating with       thinner folds. The basal parts of the two heads are covered with       moderate sized spines, those closest to the base and the sulcus       being the smallest. The distal parts of the heads are covered with       calyces. The sulcus bifurcates on the unforked part of the organ at       a point about two-thirds of the distance from the base to the       division of the organ. The sulcus is a deep groove between heavy       folds proximally and is a shallower furrow distally (Figure 4).         [Illustration: Fig. 4. Hemipenis of _Tantalophis discolor_       (Guenther).

HEATH & CO., PUBLISHERS   BOSTON -- NEW YORK -- CHICAGO           Copyright, 1911,   By D. C. Heath & Co.   1 E 3          PREFACE      The following guide to the study of animals is intended for pupils in  secondary schools. It was prepared by the authors at the request of  the Biology Round Table, an association composed of the teachers of  Biology in the Chicago High Schools, to whom the authors wish to take  this opportunity of expressing their appreciation of the many helpful  suggestions and criticisms of the manuscript.    The time has passed when a high school course in zoology consists  simply of a somewhat simplified edition of a similar course in  college. All teachers now recognize that the motivization of any  course should be its adaptability to the needs of the student, and  that zoology must be taught from the standpoint of the student rather  than that of the subject. In preparing this guide, the authors have  tried to keep these points in mind.    The matter of presentation, the order of topics, and the choice of  material has been much discussed, but the trend of opinion has  finally set in toward an ecological rather than a type study of  animals; that there should be in the case of young students a brief  study of rather a large number of animals to bring out some general  biological law, rather than an exhaustive study of a very few types.  It is further recognized that the use of a reference library is  absolutely essential in connection with and to supplement the  laboratory work, as there are some topics beyond the ability of the  young student for original investigation as well as impossible in  the amount of time usually allotted to the subject in our crowded  curricula. Of great importance is the economic side of zoology,  especially its bearing upon the applied sciences of medicine,  sanitation, household science, and agriculture, and this phase has  received special attention in this guide.    The desirability of field work has always been recognized, but the  special conditions under which schools must work are so variable as  to make any set directions for field work of little value, and so  they have in most cases been omitted in this work. Each teacher can  easily give such special direction for collecting material and study  in the field as the locality of the school and the time available for  it shall determine.    Since zoology will probably be the pupil's first laboratory science,  the authors have preceded the more formal portion of the manual with  a series of short exercises on familiar and easily obtained animals  in order to introduce the pupil to the laboratory method and to  stimulate his interest, training him at the outset to be constantly  on the outlook for specimens and to show him how much may be learned  from common things right around him, if he will only use his eyes. We  have also begun the more formal portion of the guide with insects,  since in the fall they are easily collected and may be studied alive.  They illustrate, moreover, the principles of classification and  method of using keys and other means of finding out the names of  animals. This would seem to be pedagogically sound, for some recent  experiments with pupils show that the first question that comes into  a child's mind upon seeing a new or strange specimen is \"What is it?\"    A larger portion of the guide is given to the chordates than is  usually the case. The authors also believe that this is correct and  in accord with the natural interest of the pupil. It will serve to  connect his zoology more closely with his daily experiences.    There is material enough provided to allow the teacher a chance to  select that best adapted to his purposes or conditions as well as to  provide for those schools that give more than one year to zoology.

Of secondary importance is the introduction of laboratory  methods by easy stages. The pupil should feel that his natural  curiosity is only being directed to definite ends and that he is free  to investigate in his own way.    The types here given are only a few of the many to be found in the  early fall, and these exercises in several cases may be used for  other forms than those definitely mentioned. There should be a great  deal of promiscuous collecting by the class, and in the mass of  material gathered the following types will probably be fairly  abundant.      THE LIVING FLY          _Materials._    Living flies in cages and individual specimens in small wide-mouth  vials with cotton stoppers for the admission of air. Sugar crystals  may be used for feeding. Simple lenses.          _Observations._    Notice the division of the body into three regions: head, thorax, and  abdomen. The six legs, the large wings, and the small feelers may be  easily found, as are the large eyes, the extensible mouth, and  beneath the larger wings the small undeveloped ones looking like tiny  knobs.    1. State the general color of your specimen and give any special  markings on its body.    2. Is the body smooth or has it a covering of any kind? Do you regard  the fly as a cleanly animal? Why?    3. Under what conditions does the fly use its legs? its wings? What  enables it to walk upside down? What use can you assign to"]]]
