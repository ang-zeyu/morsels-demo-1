THE BADGER    PART I      I do not know of the existence of any monograph on the Badger, ancient  or modern, in English or any other language. Nor have I been able to  find any adequate description in any work on natural history or British  fauna of this the largest, and by no means the least interesting, of the  real wild animals that still exist in England and Wales. So that,  however unfitted I may be to write a scientific treatise on the last of  the bear tribe that we have yet with us, I have ventured to think that  my own observations and researches, with experiences of the chase of  this troglodyte, may be of interest to lovers of the animal world, and  to not a few sportsmen.    From my boyhood all wild animals have had for me an intense fascination,  and though in later years my hunting-grounds have been for the most part  in other countries and continents, and among larger game, I doubt if any  of the beasts whose acquaintance I have thus made has been a source of  greater interest to me than the badger. The charm of an animal for man,  where the sporting is the master instinct, appears to be measured by his  capacity to elude observation and defy pursuit; and the badger, judged  by this test, is a charming creature. I may be mistaken, but to me it  appears that the chase in its widest sense is one of the best schools  for studying nature. Such knowledge as I have gained of the badger has  been due to the indulgence of this \"brutal\" instinct, as it is profanely  called, and from quiet observation. If the reader will spare a little  time, I will show him the manner in which my observations are made, but  I warn him that there is nothing scientific about them. I have no  microscope and no dissecting-room.    It is June. A hot summer's day is dying, and the sun is sinking through  soft clouds of glory behind the pine woods on the hill. A thousand birds  in vale and woodland are singing with an ecstasy and sweetness that seem  tenderly conscious that the hours of song are numbered--that the days  are coming when darkness or dawn will steal over the land in silence,  unheralded as it is to-day by their wild sweet notes. We wander across  the pasture by the cattle, and along the side of the ripening meadow  towards the wooded bank under the edge of the moor, where the badger has  his home. As we near the covert, a few rabbits that have ventured far  out into the field frisk up the hill, alarming their less adventurous  companions, and all make for the shelter of the wood, displaying a  hundred little cotton tails.    As the gate into the plantation opens a few wood-pigeons stop their  cooing and fly swiftly up and out of the trees with a clean cutting  slap-slap of their wings to some other solitude safer from intrusion.  Once in the shadow of the firs, softly treading we come up-wind to the  badger \"set.\" Here we choose a place among the larch stems which gives  us a good view of the most-used entrances to the earth, some fifteen  yards from the nearest hole. We turn up our coat-collars, draw our caps  over our faces, and settle ourselves in such positions as will least try  our patience and muscles during the hour in which we must remain  immovable. In idea nothing could be more delightful than to sit in the  deepening twilight of a summer's evening, with a soft breath of air  stirring the feathery larch tops against the sky above, the ground  carpeted with the vivid green of the opening bracken, surrounded by the  music of cooing wood-pigeons, the full notes of blackbird and thrush,  and listening to the pleasant sounds carried on the breeze from the  distant farms.    Delightful as is the enjoyment of the confidences of Nature in her most  hidden solitudes, the pleasure has its price, and the angler on a  summer's eve can sympathize with the man who sits over a badger earth.  But he at least can protect himself to some extent against the  exasperating attacks of midges in myriads, and vent his feelings aloud,  and flog the waters, whilst the latter must stoically endure the torture  and the plague. The most he can do is occasionally to draw his hand from  his pocket, and slowly move it to his face and massacre the settlers on  his nose, his ears, his neck, and carefully move it again into its  hiding-place. In spite of the torment, however, he may enjoy the sights  and sounds, known to but few, that these witching hours alone can give.  The rabbits emerge within a yard of him, first the little ones,  unconscious of his eye, then the old ones sit up and, imitating his  immovability, watch him critically with their black beady eyes set, and  noses palpitating; after a while old paterfamilias gives his signal of  alarm or warning by a sharp pat, pat with his hind foot, telling all  round that there is something in his vicinity he does not know how to  account for. The cry of the startled blackbird warns that some other  enemy is on foot as he flies from the bur-tree to the thorn, and we see  an old fox moving through the young bracken with lowered head and brush,  starting off on his nightly raid. A belated squirrel throws himself from  the tree above, runs close by us on the ground, up the stem of a larch,  and is soon lost in the sea of green above. A numerous and dissipated  family of little crested wrens, which should have settled for the night  ere this, twitter with diminutive voices as they twist in and out and  hang on the boughs of the spruce in front of us.    Gradually, as the daylight fades, one after another of the singers  becomes silent, the sounds of day are hushed, and a perfect silence  reigns in the twilight amidst the trees. Without any warning we are  conscious of the clean black-and-white face of an old badger over the  earthwork outside his hole, and presently he is all in view, sitting  with bowed fore-legs and his head turning on his lithe outstretched  neck, scenting the night air. There is nothing to excite his suspicion,  so he shambles to the nearest tree, puts up his fore-feet and rubs his  neck, smells round the well-known trunk, and having satisfied himself  that all is as usual, sits for awhile admiring the limited landscape  before him. He then shuffles a few yards from the earth, scratches the  soil here and there as if to keep his digging tools in order, and  returns to the bottom of the tree. Another pied face appears, and more  quickly than the first she trundles off to join her mate, and they  bounce along one after another over the earths, round the trees, down  one hole and out at another, and then rest awhile outside the earth they  first emerged from. Three more come forth, and go through very much the  same programme as the first, snorting and bumping along one after the  other and one against the other.    Presently one takes off into the thickest covert. You can hear him  bumping along, sweeping through the bracken and crackling the dead wood.  Presently the others come past you, tumbling along so close that you  could hit them with your stick. Probably they take no notice, but if you  wink, wince, or move they will shamble back to the earth and watch you  for ten minutes. It is then a trial for your nerves. If you move you  have seen the last of them for the night, but if you succeed in being  perfectly still they will recover sufficient confidence to sally forth  again, but will take off quickly in different directions for their  night's ramble. Then at last we may raise our stiff limbs and turn our  steps through the dark woods, leaving the fox and badger to their  devices, and once more frightening the rabbits which flash past us as we  wade homewards through the grass heavy and wet with dew. We have made no  startling discovery on this our first night together by the badger  \"set,\" but probably we have made a better acquaintance with badgers in  this hour than we could have gained in any museum of natural history,  with the assistance of the most erudite Fellow of the Zoological  Society.    To understand and appreciate all sides of the badger's character you  must see him in war as well as at peace; and such knowledge has to be  purchased by great labour and bodily fatigue. In the name of sport, as  in the name of liberty, great crimes are often committed. There are  those who look upon hunting of all sorts as cruel and degrading, and  cannot understand the pleasures of a chase involving the distress of  pursuit or pain to any animal. I have a certain sympathy for such  sentiments, and yet, paradoxical as it may appear, my very love of  animals increases my passion for hunting them. Besides the longing to  come to close quarters with them, the desire to possess or to handle  them, there is the natural ambition to be even with them. There is an  unwritten code of honour in the field which, if followed, makes the  struggle of wits and strength, of skill and endurance, a fair one, and  one in which alone many a valuable lesson out of Nature's book can be  taught.

THE CHICKADEE          IN NEW ENGLAND FIELDS AND WOODS          I    THE NAMELESS SEASON      In the March page of our almanac, opposite the 20th of the month we find  the bold assertion, \"Now spring begins;\" but in the northern part of New  England, for which this almanac was especially compiled, the weather  does not bear out the statement.    The snow may be gone from the fields except in grimy drifts, in hollows  and along fences and woodsides; but there is scarcely a sign of spring  in the nakedness of pasture, meadow, and ploughed land, now more dreary  in the dun desolation of lifeless grass, debris of stacks, and black  furrows than when the first snow covered the lingering greenness of  December.    It is quite as likely that the open lands are still under the worn and  dusty blanket of snow, smirched with all the litter cast upon it by  cross-lot-faring teams, and wintry winds blowing for months from every  quarter. The same untidiness pervades all outdoors. We could never  believe that so many odds and ends could have been thrown out of doors  helter-skelter, in three months of ordinary life, till the proof  confronts us on the surface of the subsiding snow or lies stranded on  the bare earth. The wind comes with an icier breath from the wintrier  north, and yet blows untempered from the south, over fields by turns  frozen and sodden, through which the swollen brooks rush in yellow  torrents with sullen monotonous complaint.    One may get more comfort in the woods, though the snow still lies deep  in their shelter; for here may be found the sugar-maker's camp, with its  mixed odors of pungent smoke and saccharine steam, its wide environment  of dripping spouts and tinkling tin buckets, signs that at last the  pulse of the trees is stirred by a subtle promise of returning spring.    The coarse-grained snow is strewn thickly with shards of bark that the  trees have sloughed in their long hibernation, with shreds and tatters  of their tempest-torn branches. But all this litter does not offend the  eye nor look out of place, like that which is scattered in fields and  about homesteads. When this three months' downfall of fragments sinks to  the carpet of flattened leaves, it will be at one with it, an inwoven  pattern, as comely as the shifting mesh of browner shadows that trunks  and branches weave between the splashes of sunshine. Among these is a  garnishment of green moss patches and fronds of perennial ferns which  tell of life that the stress of winter could not overcome. One may  discover, amid the purple lobes of the squirrelcup leaves, downy buds  that promise blossoms, and others, callower, but of like promise, under  the rusty links of the arbutus chain.    One hears the resonant call of a woodpecker rattled out on a seasoned  branch or hollow stub, and may catch the muffled beat of the partridge's  drum, silent since the dreamy days of Indian summer, now throbbing  again in slow and accelerated pulsations of evasive sound through the  unroofed arches of the woodlands. And one may hear, wondering where the  poor vagrants find food and water, the wild clangor of the geese  trumpeting their aerial northward march, and the quick whistle of the  wild duck's pinions,--hear the carol of an untimely bluebird and the  disconsolate yelp of a robin; but yet it is not spring.    Presently comes a great downfall of snow, making the earth beautiful  again with a whiteness outshining that of the winter that is past. The  damp flakes cling to every surface, and clothe wall, fence and tree,  field and forest, with a more radiant mantle than the dusty snow and  slanted sunshine of winter gave them.    There is nothing hopeful of spring but a few meagre signs, and the  tradition that spring has always come heretofore.    It is not winter, it is not spring, but a season with an individuality  as marked as either, yet without a name.          II    MARCH DAYS      Back and forth across the land, in swift and sudden alternation, the  March winds toss days of bitter cold and days of genial warmth, now out  of the eternal winter of the north, now from the endless summer of the  tropics.    Repeated thawing and freezing has given the snow a coarse grain. It is  like a mass of fine hailstones and with no hint of the soft and feathery  flakes that wavered down like white blossoms shed from the unseen bloom  of some far-off upper world and that silently transformed the  unseemliness of the black and tawny earth into the beauty of immaculate  purity.    One day, when the wind breathes from the south a continuous breath of  warmth, your feet sink into this later coarseness come of its base  earthly association, with a grinding slump, as in loose wet sand, so  deep, perhaps, that your tracks are gray puddles, marking your toilsome  way.    As you wallow on, or perch for a moment's rest on a naked fence-top  among the smirched drifts, you envy the crows faring so easily along  their aerial paths above you. How pleasant are the voices of these  returning exiles, not enemies now, but friendly messengers, bringing  tidings of spring. You do not begrudge them the meagre feasts they find,  the frozen apple still hanging, brown and wrinkled, in the bare orchard,  or the winter-killed youngling of flock or herd, cast forth upon a  dunghill, and which discovered, one generous vagabond calls all his  black comrades to partake of.    Watching them as they lag across the sky, yet swifter than the white  clouds drift above them, you presently note that these stand still, as  you may verify by their blue shadows on the snow, lying motionless, with  the palpitating shadows of the crows plunging into them on this side,  then, lost for an instant in the blue obscurity, then, emerging on that  side with the same untiring beat of shadowy wings. A puff of wind comes  out of the north, followed by an angry gust, and then a howling wintry  blast that the crows stagger against in labored flight as they make for  the shelter of the woods.    You, too, toil to shelter and fireside warmth, and are thankful to be  out of the biting wind and the treacherous footing. The change has come  so suddenly that the moist, grainy snow is frozen before it has time to  leach, and in a little while gives you a surface most delightful to walk  upon, and shortens distances to half what they were. It has lost its  first pure whiteness wherewith no other whiteness can compare, but it is  yet beyond all things else, and in the sunlight dazzles you with a"]]]
