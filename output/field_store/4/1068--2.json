Pusey (Edward Bouverie)      AD 401          BOOK I      Great art Thou, O Lord, and greatly to be praised; great is Thy power,  and Thy wisdom infinite. And Thee would man praise; man, but a particle  of Thy creation; man, that bears about him his mortality, the witness of  his sin, the witness that Thou resistest the proud: yet would man praise  Thee; he, but a particle of Thy creation. Thou awakest us to delight in  Thy praise; for Thou madest us for Thyself, and our heart is restless,  until it repose in Thee. Grant me, Lord, to know and understand which is  first, to call on Thee or to praise Thee? and, again, to know Thee or  to call on Thee? for who can call on Thee, not knowing Thee? for he that  knoweth Thee not, may call on Thee as other than Thou art. Or, is it  rather, that we call on Thee that we may know Thee? but how shall they  call on Him in whom they have not believed? or how shall they believe  without a preacher? and they that seek the Lord shall praise Him: for  they that seek shall find Him, and they that find shall praise Him.  I will seek Thee, Lord, by calling on Thee; and will call on Thee,  believing in Thee; for to us hast Thou been preached. My faith, Lord,  shall call on Thee, which Thou hast given me, wherewith Thou hast  inspired me, through the Incarnation of Thy Son, through the ministry of  the Preacher.    And how shall I call upon my God, my God and Lord, since, when I call  for Him, I shall be calling Him to myself? and what room is there within  me, whither my God can come into me? whither can God come into me, God  who made heaven and earth? is there, indeed, O Lord my God, aught in me  that can contain Thee? do then heaven and earth, which Thou hast made,  and wherein Thou hast made me, contain Thee? or, because nothing which  exists could exist without Thee, doth therefore whatever exists contain  Thee? Since, then, I too exist, why do I seek that Thou shouldest enter  into me, who were not, wert Thou not in me? Why? because I am not gone  down in hell, and yet Thou art there also. For if I go down into hell,  Thou art there. I could not be then, O my God, could not be at all,  wert Thou not in me; or, rather, unless I were in Thee, of whom are all  things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things? Even so, Lord,  even so. Whither do I call Thee, since I am in Thee? or whence canst  Thou enter into me? for whither can I go beyond heaven and earth, that  thence my God should come into me, who hath said, I fill the heaven and  the earth.    Do the heaven and earth then contain Thee, since Thou fillest them? or  dost Thou fill them and yet overflow, since they do not contain Thee?  And whither, when the heaven and the earth are filled, pourest Thou  forth the remainder of Thyself? or hast Thou no need that aught contain  Thee, who containest all things, since what Thou fillest Thou fillest  by containing it? for the vessels which Thou fillest uphold Thee not,  since, though they were broken, Thou wert not poured out. And when Thou  art poured out on us, Thou art not cast down, but Thou upliftest us;  Thou art not dissipated, but Thou gatherest us. But Thou who fillest  all things, fillest Thou them with Thy whole self? or, since all things  cannot contain Thee wholly, do they contain part of Thee? and all at  once the same part? or each its own part, the greater more, the smaller  less? And is, then one part of Thee greater, another less? or, art Thou  wholly every where, while nothing contains Thee wholly?    What art Thou then, my God? what, but the Lord God? For who is Lord  but the Lord? or who is God save our God? Most highest, most good, most  potent, most omnipotent; most merciful, yet most just; most hidden,  yet most present; most beautiful, yet most strong, stable, yet  incomprehensible; unchangeable, yet all-changing; never new, never old;  all-renewing, and bringing age upon the proud, and they know it not;  ever working, ever at rest; still gathering, yet nothing lacking;  supporting, filling, and overspreading; creating, nourishing, and  maturing; seeking, yet having all things. Thou lovest, without passion;  art jealous, without anxiety; repentest, yet grievest not; art angry,  yet serene; changest Thy works, Thy purpose unchanged; receivest again  what Thou findest, yet didst never lose; never in need, yet rejoicing  in gains; never covetous, yet exacting usury. Thou receivest over and  above, that Thou mayest owe; and who hath aught that is not Thine? Thou  payest debts, owing nothing; remittest debts, losing nothing. And what  had I now said, my God, my life, my holy joy? or what saith any man when  he speaks of Thee? Yet woe to him that speaketh not, since mute are even  the most eloquent.    Oh! that I might repose on Thee! Oh! that Thou wouldest enter into my  heart, and inebriate it, that I may forget my ills, and embrace Thee,  my sole good! What art Thou to me? In Thy pity, teach me to utter it.  Or what am I to Thee that Thou demandest my love, and, if I give it not,  art wroth with me, and threatenest me with grievous woes? Is it then a  slight woe to love Thee not? Oh! for Thy mercies' sake, tell me, O Lord  my God, what Thou art unto me. Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. So  speak, that I may hear. Behold, Lord, my heart is before Thee; open Thou  the ears thereof, and say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. After this  voice let me haste, and take hold on Thee. Hide not Thy face from me.  Let me die--lest I die--only let me see Thy face.    Narrow is the mansion of my soul; enlarge Thou it, that Thou mayest  enter in. It is ruinous; repair Thou it. It has that within which must  offend Thine eyes; I confess and know it. But who shall cleanse it? or  to whom should I cry, save Thee? Lord, cleanse me from my secret faults,  and spare Thy servant from the power of the enemy. I believe, and  therefore do I speak. Lord, Thou knowest. Have I not confessed against  myself my transgressions unto Thee, and Thou, my God, hast forgiven the  iniquity of my heart? I contend not in judgment with Thee, who art the  truth; I fear to deceive myself; lest mine iniquity lie unto itself.  Therefore I contend not in judgment with Thee; for if Thou, Lord,  shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall abide it?    Yet suffer me to speak unto Thy mercy, me, dust and ashes. Yet suffer me  to speak, since I speak to Thy mercy, and not to scornful man. Thou too,  perhaps, despisest me, yet wilt Thou return and have compassion upon me.  For what would I say, O Lord my God, but that I know not whence I  came into this dying life (shall I call it?) or living death. Then  immediately did the comforts of Thy compassion take me up, as I heard  (for I remember it not) from the parents of my flesh, out of whose  substance Thou didst sometime fashion me. Thus there received me the  comforts of woman's milk. For neither my mother nor my nurses stored  their own breasts for me; but Thou didst bestow the food of my infancy  through them, according to Thine ordinance, whereby Thou distributest  Thy riches through the hidden springs of all things. Thou also gavest me  to desire no more than Thou gavest; and to my nurses willingly to give  me what Thou gavest them. For they, with a heaven-taught affection,  willingly gave me what they abounded with from Thee. For this my good  from them, was good for them. Nor, indeed, from them was it, but through  them; for from Thee, O God, are all good things, and from my God is all  my health. This I since learned, Thou, through these Thy gifts, within  me and without, proclaiming Thyself unto me. For then I knew but to  suck; to repose in what pleased, and cry at what offended my flesh;  nothing more.    Afterwards I began to smile; first in sleep, then waking: for so it  was told me of myself, and I believed it; for we see the like in other  infants, though of myself I remember it not. Thus, little by little, I  became conscious where I was; and to have a wish to express my wishes  to those who could content them, and I could not; for the wishes were  within me, and they without; nor could they by any sense of theirs enter  within my spirit. So I flung about at random limbs and voice, making  the few signs I could, and such as I could, like, though in truth very  little like, what I wished. And when I was not presently obeyed (my  wishes being hurtful or unintelligible), then I was indignant with my  elders for not submitting to me, with those owing me no service, for  not serving me; and avenged myself on them by tears. Such have I learnt  infants to be from observing them; and that I was myself such, they, all  unconscious, have shown me better than my nurses who knew it.    And, lo! my infancy died long since, and I live. But Thou, Lord, who for  ever livest, and in whom nothing dies: for before the foundation of the  worlds, and before all that can be called \"before,\" Thou art, and art  God and Lord of all which Thou hast created: in Thee abide, fixed  for ever, the first causes of all things unabiding; and of all things  changeable, the springs abide in Thee unchangeable: and in Thee live the  eternal reasons of all things unreasoning and temporal. Say, Lord, to  me, Thy suppliant; say, all-pitying, to me, Thy pitiable one; say, did  my infancy succeed another age of mine that died before it? was it  that which I spent within my mother's womb? for of that I have heard  somewhat, and have myself seen women with child? and what before that  life again, O God my joy, was I any where or any body? For this have I  none to tell me, neither father nor mother, nor experience of others,  nor mine own memory. Dost Thou mock me for asking this, and bid me  praise Thee and acknowledge Thee, for that I do know?    I acknowledge Thee, Lord of heaven and earth, and praise Thee for my  first rudiments of being, and my infancy, whereof I remember"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32962"],[0,"A Handbook of Laboratory Glass-Blowing (#1)"],[1,"https://www.pgdp.net.

To attempt even a complete outline of the methods used in  making commercial apparatus would involve more than could be undertaken  without omitting the essential details of manipulation that a novice  needs. I have, therefore, confined myself as far as possible to such  work as will find practical application in the laboratory and will, I  hope, prove of value to those whose interests lie therein.    The method of treatment and somewhat disjointed style of writing have  been chosen solely with the view to economy of space without the undue  sacrifice of clearness.                                                  BERNARD D. BOLAS.          Handbook of Laboratory Glass-Blowing          CHAPTER I         Introduction and Preliminary Remarks--General Principles to       be observed in Glass Working--Choice of Apparatus--Tools and       Appliances--Glass.      Glass-blowing is neither very easy nor very difficult; there are  operations so easy that the youngest laboratory boy should be able to  repeat them successfully after once having been shown the way, there are  operations so difficult that years are needed to train eye and hand and  judgment to carry them out; but the greater number of scientific needs  lie between these two extremes. Yet a surprisingly large number of  scientific workers fail even to join a glass tube or make a T piece that  will not crack spontaneously, and the fault is rather one of  understanding than of lack of ability to carry out the necessary  manipulation.    In following the scheme of instruction adopted in this handbook, it will  be well for the student to pay particular attention to the reason given  for each detail of the desirable procedure, and, as far as may be, to  memorise it. Once having mastered the underlying reason, he can evolve  schemes of manipulation to suit his own particular needs, although, as a  rule, those given in the following pages will be found to embody the  result of many years' experience.    There is a wide choice of apparatus, from a simple mouth-blowpipe and a  candle flame to a power-driven blower and a multiple-jet heating device.  All are useful, and all have their special applications, but, for the  present, we will consider the ordinary types of bellows and blowpipes,  such as one usually finds in a chemical or physical laboratory.    The usual, or Herepath, type of gas blowpipe consists of an outer tube  through which coal gas can be passed and an inner tube through which a  stream of air may be blown. Such a blowpipe is shown in section by Fig.  1. It is desirable to have the three centring screws as shown, in order  to adjust the position of the air jet and obtain a well-shaped flame,  but these screws are sometimes omitted. Fig. 1, _a_ and _b_ show the  effects of defective centring of the air jet, _c_ shows the effect of  dirt or roughness in the inside of the air jet, _d_ shows a satisfactory  flame.    [Illustration: Fig 1]    For many purposes, it is an advantage to have what is sometimes known  as a \"quick-change\" blowpipe; that is one in which jets of varying size  may be brought into position without stopping the work for more than a  fraction of a second. Such a device is made by Messrs. Letcher, and is  shown by _e_, and in section by _f_ Fig. 1. It is only necessary to  rotate the desired jet into position in order to connect it with both  gas and air supplies. A small bye-pass ignites the gas, and adjustment  of gas and air may be made by a partial rotation of the cylinder which  carries the jets.    For specially heavy work, where it is needed to heat a large mass of  glass, a multiple blowpipe jet of the pattern invented by my father,  Thomas Bolas, as the result of a suggestion derived from a study of the  jet used in Griffin's gas furnace, is of considerable value. This jet  consists of a block of metal in which are drilled seven holes, one being  central and the other six arranged in a close circle around the central  hole. To each of these holes is a communication way leading to the gas  supply, and an air jet is arranged centrally in each. Each hole has also  an extension tube fitted into it, the whole effect being that of seven  blowpipes. In order to provide a final adjustment for the flame, a  perforated plate having seven holes which correspond in size and  position to the outer tubes is arranged to slide on parallel guides in  front of these outer tubes.    [Illustration: Fig. 2]    The next piece of apparatus for consideration is the bellows, of which  there are three or more types on the market, although all consist of two  essential parts, the blower or bellows proper and the wind chamber or  reservoir. Two patterns are shown in Fig. 2; _a_, is the form which is  commonly used by jewellers and metal workers to supply the air blast  necessary for heating small furnaces. Such a bellows may be obtained at  almost any jewellers' supply dealer in Clerkenwell, but it not  infrequently happens that the spring in the wind chamber is too strong  for glass-blowing, and hence the air supply tends to vary in pressure.  This can be improved by fitting a weaker spring, but an easier way and  one that usually gives fairly satisfactory results, is to place an  ordinary screw-clip on the rubber tube leading from the bellows to the  blowpipe, and to tighten this until an even blast is obtained.    Another form of bellows, made by Messrs. Fletcher and Co., and common in  most laboratories, is shown by _b_; the wind chamber consists of a disc  of india-rubber clamped under a circular frame or tied on to a circular  rim. This form is shown by Fig. 2, _b_.    The third form, and one which my own experience has caused me to prefer  to any other, is cylindrical, and stands inside the pedestal of the  blowpipe-table. A blowpipe-table of this description is made by Enfer of  Paris.    There is no need, however, to purchase an expensive table for laboratory  use. All the work described in this book can quite well be done with a  simple foot bellows and a quick-change blowpipe. Nearly all of it can be  done with a single jet blowpipe, such as that described first, or even  with the still simpler apparatus mentioned on page 84, but I do not  advise the beginner to practise with quite so simple a form at first,  and for that reason have postponed a description of it until the last  chapter.    Glass-blowers' tools and appliances are many and various, quite a number  of them are better rejected than used, but there are a few essentials.  These are,--file, glass-knife, small turn-pin, large turn-pin, carbon  cones, carbon plate, rubber tube of small diameter, various sizes of  corks, and an asbestos heat reflector. For ordinary work, an annealing  oven is not necessary, but one is described on page 60 in connection  with the special cases where annealing is desirable.    Fig. 3 illustrates the tools and appliances. _a_ is an end view of the  desirable form of file, and shows the best method of grinding the edges  in order to obtain a highly satisfactory tool. _b_ is a glass knife,  shown both in perspective and end view, it is made of glass-hard steel  and should be sharpened on a rough stone, such as a scythe-stone, in  order to give a slightly irregular edge. _c_ is a small turn-pin which  may be made by flattening and filing the end of a six-inch nail. _d_ is  the large turn-pin and"]]]
