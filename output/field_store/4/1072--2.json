BY JOHN L. STEPHENS,        AUTHOR OF \"INCIDENTS OF TRAVEL IN EGYPT, ARABIA PETRAEA, AND THE         HOLY LAND,\" \"INCIDENTS OF TRAVEL IN CENTRAL AMERICA,\" ETC.                             ILLUSTRATED BY 120 ENGRAVINGS.                                    IN TWO VOLUMES.                                    VOL. I.

Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1843, by                             HARPER & BROTHERS,         In the Clerk's Office of the Southern District of New-York                                          PREFACE.      In his \"Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan,\"  the author intimated his intention to make a more thorough exploration  of the ruins of the latter country. That intention has since been  carried into effect, and the following pages are the result. They  describe, as the author has reason to believe, the most extensive  journey ever made by a stranger in that peninsula, and contain the  account of visits to forty-four ruined cities, or places in which  remains or vestiges of ancient population were found. The existence of  most of these ruins was entirely unknown to the residents of the  capital;--but few had ever been visited by white inhabitants;--they  were desolate, and overgrown with trees. For a brief space the  stillness that reigned around them was broken, and they were again left  to solitude and silence. Time and the elements are hastening them to  utter destruction. In a few generations, great edifices, their facades  covered with sculptured ornaments, already cracked and yawning, must  fall, and become mere shapeless mounds. It has been the fortune of the  author to step between them and the entire destruction to which they  are destined; and it is his hope to snatch from oblivion these  perishing, but still gigantic memorials of a mysterious people. The  descriptions are accompanied by full illustrations from Daguerreotype  views and drawings taken on the spot by Mr. Catherwood, and the  engravings were executed under his personal superintendence.

Here it is the reality of modern warfare not only as  it appears to British soldiers, of whom I can tell, but to soldiers on  all the fronts where conditions were the same.    What I have written here does not cancel, nor alter, nor deny anything  in my daily narratives of events on the western front as they are now  published in book form. They stand, I may claim sincerely and humbly,  as a truthful, accurate, and tragic record of the battles in France and  Belgium during the years of war, broadly pictured out as far as I could  see and know. My duty, then, was that of a chronicler, not arguing why  things should have happened so nor giving reasons why they should not  happen so, but describing faithfully many of the things I saw, and  narrating the facts as I found them, as far as the censorship would  allow. After early, hostile days it allowed nearly all but criticism,  protest, and of the figures of loss.    The purpose of this book is to get deeper into the truth of this war and  of all war--not by a more detailed narrative of events, but rather as  the truth was revealed to the minds of men, in many aspects, out  of their experience; and by a plain statement of realities, however  painful, to add something to the world's knowledge out of which men of  good-will may try to shape some new system of relationship between one  people and another, some new code of international morality, preventing  or at least postponing another massacre of youth like that five years'  sacrifice of boys of which I was a witness.            PART ONE. OBSERVERS AND COMMANDERS          I      When Germany threw down her challenge to Russia and France, and England  knew that her Imperial power would be one of the prizes of German  victory (the common people did not think this, at first, but saw only  the outrage to Belgium, a brutal attack on civilization, and a glorious  adventure), some newspaper correspondents were sent out from London to  report the proceedings, and I was one of them.    We went in civilian clothes without military passports--the War Office  was not giving any--with bags of money which might be necessary for the  hire of motor-cars, hotel life, and the bribery of doorkeepers in the  antechambers of war, as some of us had gone to the Balkan War, and  others. The Old Guard of war correspondents besieged the War Office  for official recognition and were insulted day after day by junior  staff-officers who knew that \"K\" hated these men and thought the press  ought to be throttled in time of war; or they were beguiled into false  hopes by officials who hoped to go in charge of them and were told to  buy horses and sleeping-bags and be ready to start at a moment's notice  for the front.    The moment's notice was postponed for months....    The younger ones did not wait for it. They took their chance of \"seeing  something,\" without authority, and made wild, desperate efforts to break  through the barrier that had been put up against them by French and  British staffs in the zone of war. Many of them were arrested, put  into prison, let out, caught again in forbidden places, rearrested, and  expelled from France. That was after fantastic adventures in which they  saw what war meant in civilized countries where vast populations were  made fugitives of fear, where millions of women and children and old  people became wanderers along the roads in a tide of human misery, with  the red flame of war behind them and following them, and where the first  battalions of youth, so gay in their approach to war, so confident of  victory, so careless of the dangers (which they did not know), came back  maimed and mangled and blinded and wrecked, in the backwash of retreat,  which presently became a spate through Belgium and the north of France,  swamping over many cities and thousands of villages and many fields.  Those young writing-men who had set out in a spirit of adventure went  back to Fleet Street with a queer look in their eyes, unable to write  the things they had seen, unable to tell them to people who had not seen  and could not understand. Because there was no code of words which would  convey the picture of that wild agony of peoples, that smashing of all  civilized laws, to men and women who still thought of war in terms of  heroic pageantry.    \"Had a good time?\" asked a colleague along the corridor, hardly waiting  for an answer.    \"A good time!\"... God!... Did people think it was amusing to be an  onlooker of world-tragedy?... One of them remembered a lady of France  with a small boy who had fled from Charleville, which was in flames and  smoke. She was weak with hunger, with dirty and bedraggled skirts on her  flight, and she had heard that her husband was in the battle that was  now being fought round their own town. She was brave--pointed out the  line of the German advance on the map--and it was in a troop-train  crowded with French soldiers--and then burst into wild weeping, clasping  the hand of an English writing-man so that her nails dug into his flesh.  I remember her still.    \"Courage, maman! Courage, p'tite maman!\" said the boy of eight.    Through Amiens at night had come a French army in retreat. There were  dead and wounded on their wagons. Cuirassiers stumbled as they led their  tired horses. Crowds of people with white faces, like ghosts in the  darkness, stared at their men retreating like this through their city,  and knew that the enemy was close behind.    \"Nous sommes perdus!\" whispered a woman, and gave a wailing cry.    People were fighting their way into railway trucks at every station for  hundreds of miles across northern France. Women were beseeching a place  for the sake of their babes. There was no food for them on journeys of  nineteen hours or more; they fainted with heat and hunger. An old woman  died, and her corpse blocked up the lavatory. At night they slept on the  pavements in cities invaded by fugitives.    At Furnes in Belgium, and at Dunkirk on the coast of France, there were  columns of ambulances bringing in an endless tide of wounded. They were  laid out stretcher by stretcher in station-yards, five hundred at a  time. Some of their faces were masks of clotted blood. Some of their  bodies were horribly torn. They breathed with a hard snuffle. A foul  smell came from them.    At Chartres they were swilling over the station hall with disinfecting  fluid after getting through with one day's wounded. The French doctor  in charge had received a telegram from the director of medical services:  \"Make ready for forty thousand wounded.\" It was during the first battle  of the Marne.    \"It is impossible!\" said the French doctor....    Four hundred thousand people were in flight from Antwerp, into which  big shells were falling, as English correspondents flattened themselves  against the walls and said, \"God in heaven!\" Two hundred and  fifty thousand people coming across the Scheldt in rowing-boats,  sailing-craft, rafts, invaded one village in Holland. They had no  food. Children were mad with fright. Young mothers had no milk in their  breasts. It was cold at night and there were only a few canal-boats and  fishermen's cottages, and in them were crowds of fugitives. The odor  of human filth exuded from them, as I smell it now, and sicken in  remembrance....    Then Dixmude was in flames, and Pervyse, and many other towns from the  Belgian coast to Switzerland. In Dixmude young boys of France--fusiliers  marins--lay dead about the Grande Place. In the Town Hall, falling to  bits under shell-fire, a colonel stood dazed and waiting for death amid  the dead bodies of his men--one so young, so handsome, lying there on  his back, with a waxen face, staring steadily at the sky through the  broken roof....    At Nieuport-les-Bains one dead soldier lay at the end of the esplanade,  and a little group of living were huddled under the wall of a red-brick  villa, watching other villas falling like card houses in a town that had  been built for love and pretty women and the lucky people of the world.  British monitors lying close into shore were answering the German  bombardment, firing over Nieuport to the dunes by Ostend. From one  monitor came a group of figures with white masks of cotton-wool tipped  with wet blood. British seamen, and all blind, with the dead body of an  officer tied up in a sack....    \"O Jesu!... O maman!... O ma pauvre p'tite femme!... O Jesu! O Jesu!\"    From thousands of French soldiers lying wounded or parched in the  burning sun before the battle of the Marne these cries went up to the  blue sky of France in August of '14. They were the cries of youth's  agony in war. Afterward I went across the fields where they fought and  saw their bodies and their graves, and the proof of the victory that  saved France and us. The German dead had been gathered into heaps like  autumn leaves. They were soaked in petrol and oily smoke was rising from  them....    That was after the retreat from Mons, and the French retreat along all  their line, and the thrust that drew very close to Paris, when I saw our  little Regular Army, the \"Old Contemptibles,\" on their way back, with  the German hordes following close.
