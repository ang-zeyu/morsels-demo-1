Old Baldy, highest of the White Mountains, stood up round and bare,  rimmed bright gold in the last glow of the setting sun. Then, as the  fire dropped behind the domed peak, a change, a cold and darkening  blight, passed down the black spear-pointed slopes over all that  mountain world.    It was a wild, richly timbered, and abundantly watered region of dark  forests and grassy parks, ten thousand feet above sea-level, isolated  on all sides by the southern Arizona desert--the virgin home of elk and  deer, of bear and lion, of wolf and fox, and the birthplace as well as  the hiding-place of the fierce Apache.    September in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze  following shortly after sundown. Twilight appeared to come on its wings,  as did faint sounds, not distinguishable before in the stillness.    Milt Dale, man of the forest, halted at the edge of a timbered ridge, to  listen and to watch. Beneath him lay a narrow valley, open and grassy,  from which rose a faint murmur of running water. Its music was pierced  by the wild staccato yelp of a hunting coyote. From overhead in the  giant fir came a twittering and rustling of grouse settling for the  night; and from across the valley drifted the last low calls of wild  turkeys going to roost.    To Dale's keen ear these sounds were all they should have been,  betokening an unchanged serenity of forestland. He was glad, for he had  expected to hear the clipclop of white men's horses--which to hear up  in those fastnesses was hateful to him. He and the Indian were friends.  That fierce foe had no enmity toward the lone hunter. But there hid  somewhere in the forest a gang of bad men, sheep-thieves, whom Dale did  not want to meet.    As he started out upon the slope, a sudden flaring of the afterglow of  sunset flooded down from Old Baldy, filling the valley with lights and  shadows, yellow and blue, like the radiance of the sky. The pools in the  curves of the brook shone darkly bright. Dale's gaze swept up and down  the valley, and then tried to pierce the black shadows across the brook  where the wall of spruce stood up, its speared and spiked crest against  the pale clouds. The wind began to moan in the trees and there was a  feeling of rain in the air. Dale, striking a trail, turned his back to  the fading afterglow and strode down the valley.    With night at hand and a rain-storm brewing, he did not head for his  own camp, some miles distant, but directed his steps toward an old log  cabin. When he reached it darkness had almost set in. He approached with  caution. This cabin, like the few others scattered in the valleys, might  harbor Indians or a bear or a panther. Nothing, however, appeared to be  there. Then Dale studied the clouds driving across the sky, and he felt  the cool dampness of a fine, misty rain on his face. It would rain off  and on during the night. Whereupon he entered the cabin.    And the next moment he heard quick hoof-beats of trotting horses.  Peering out, he saw dim, moving forms in the darkness, quite close  at hand. They had approached against the wind so that sound had been  deadened. Five horses with riders, Dale made out--saw them loom close.  Then he heard rough voices. Quickly he turned to feel in the dark for a  ladder he knew led to a loft; and finding it, he quickly mounted, taking  care not to make a noise with his rifle, and lay down upon the floor  of brush and poles. Scarcely had he done so when heavy steps, with  accompaniment of clinking spurs, passed through the door below into the  cabin.    \"Wal, Beasley, are you here?\" queried a loud voice.    There was no reply. The man below growled under his breath, and again  the spurs jingled.    \"Fellars, Beasley ain't here yet,\" he called. \"Put the hosses under the  shed. We'll wait.\"    \"Wait, huh!\" came a harsh reply. \"Mebbe all night--an' we got nuthin' to  eat.\"    \"Shut up, Moze. Reckon you're no good for anythin' but eatin'. Put them  hosses away an' some of you rustle fire-wood in here.\"    Low, muttered curses, then mingled with dull thuds of hoofs and strain  of leather and heaves of tired horses.    Another shuffling, clinking footstep entered the cabin.    \"Snake, it'd been sense to fetch a pack along,\" drawled this newcomer.    \"Reckon so, Jim. But we didn't, an' what's the use hollerin'? Beasley  won't keep us waitin' long.\"    Dale, lying still and prone, felt a slow start in all his blood--a  thrilling wave. That deep-voiced man below was Snake Anson, the worst  and most dangerous character of the region; and the others, undoubtedly,  composed his gang, long notorious in that sparsely settled country.  And the Beasley mentioned--he was one of the two biggest ranchers and  sheep-raisers of the White Mountain ranges. What was the meaning of  a rendezvous between Snake Anson and Beasley? Milt Dale answered that  question to Beasley's discredit; and many strange matters pertaining to  sheep and herders, always a mystery to the little village of Pine, now  became as clear as daylight.    Other men entered the cabin.    \"It ain't a-goin' to rain much,\" said one. Then came a crash of wood  thrown to the ground.    \"Jim, hyar's a chunk of pine log, dry as punk,\" said another.    Rustlings and slow footsteps, and then heavy thuds attested to the  probability that Jim was knocking the end of a log upon the ground to  split off a corner whereby a handful of dry splinters could be procured.    \"Snake, lemme your pipe, an' I'll hev a fire in a jiffy.\"    \"Wal, I want my terbacco an' I ain't carin' about no fire,\" replied  Snake.    \"Reckon you're the meanest cuss in these woods,\" drawled Jim.    Sharp click of steel on flint--many times--and then a sound of hard  blowing and sputtering told of Jim's efforts to start a fire. Presently  the pitchy blackness of the cabin changed; there came a little crackling  of wood and the rustle of flame, and then a steady growing roar.    As it chanced, Dale lay face down upon the floor of the loft, and right  near his eyes there were cracks between the boughs. When the fire blazed  up he was fairly well able to see the men below. The only one he had  ever seen was Jim Wilson, who had been well known at Pine before Snake  Anson had ever been heard of. Jim was the best of a bad lot, and he had  friends among the honest people. It was rumored that he and Snake did  not pull well together.    \"Fire feels good,\" said the burly Moze, who appeared as broad as he was  black-visaged. \"Fall's sure a-comin'... Now if only we had some grub!\"    \"Moze, there's a hunk of deer meat in my saddle-bag, an' if you git it  you can have half,\" spoke up another voice.    Moze shuffled out with alacrity.    In the firelight Snake Anson's face looked lean and serpent-like, his  eyes glittered, and his long neck and all of his long length carried out  the analogy of his name.    \"Snake, what's this here deal with Beasley?\" inquired Jim.    \"Reckon you'll l'arn when I do,\" replied the leader. He appeared tired  and thoughtful.    \"Ain't we done away with enough of them poor greaser herders--for  nothin'?\" queried the youngest of the gang, a boy in years, whose hard,  bitter lips and hungry eyes somehow set him apart from his comrades.    \"You're dead right, Burt--an' that's my stand,\" replied the man who  had sent Moze out. \"Snake, snow 'll be flyin' round these woods before  long,\" said Jim Wilson. \"Are we goin' to winter down in the Tonto Basin  or over on the Gila?\"    \"Reckon we'll do some tall ridin' before we strike south,\" replied  Snake, gruffly.    At the juncture Moze returned.    \"Boss, I heerd a hoss comin' up the trail,\" he said.    Snake rose and stood at the door, listening. Outside the wind moaned  fitfully and scattering raindrops pattered upon the cabin.    \"A-huh!\" exclaimed Snake, in relief.    Silence ensued then for a moment, at the end of which interval Dale  heard a rapid clip-clop on the rocky trail outside. The men below  shuffled uneasily, but none of them spoke. The fire cracked cheerily.  Snake Anson stepped back from before the door with an action that  expressed both doubt and caution.    The trotting horse had halted out there somewhere.    \"Ho there, inside!\" called a voice from the darkness.    \"Ho yourself!\" replied Anson.    \"That you, Snake?\" quickly followed the query.    \"Reckon so,\" returned Anson, showing himself.    The newcomer entered. He was a large man, wearing a slicker that shone  wet in the firelight. His sombrero, pulled well down, shadowed his face,  so that the upper half of his features might as well have been masked.  He had a black, drooping mustache, and a chin like a rock. A potential  force, matured and powerful, seemed to be wrapped in his movements.    \"Hullo, Snake! Hullo, Wilson!\" he said. \"I've backed out on the other  deal. Sent for you on--on another little matter... particular private.\"    Here he indicated with a significant gesture that Snake's men were to  leave the cabin.    \"A-huh! ejaculated Anson, dubiously. Then he turned abruptly. Moze,  you an' Shady an' Burt go wait outside. Reckon this ain't the deal I  expected.... An' you can saddle the hosses.\"    The three members of the gang filed out, all glancing keenly at the  stranger, who had moved back into the shadow.    \"All right now, Beasley,\" said Anson, low-voiced. \"What's your game?  Jim, here, is in on my deals.\"    Then Beasley came forward to the fire, stretching his hands to the  blaze.    \"Nothin' to do with sheep,\" replied he.    \"Wal, I reckoned not,\" assented the other. \"An' say--whatever your game  is, I ain't likin'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34571"],[0,"The Pearl Story Book: Stories and Legends of Winter, Christmas, and New Year's (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive)                                       THE               PEARL STORY BOOK             _Stories and Legends of    Winter, Christmas, and New Year's Day_                     COMPILED BY                  ADA M.

A heavy snowstorm promises plenty of  sport for tomorrow, but at present the cosiness indoors is very  attractive, especially now that the evening story hour is at hand. And  while the story-teller is slowly choosing his subjects he hears the  children's impatient whispers of \"The Snow Man,\" \"Prince Winter,\" \"The  Legend of Holly,\" \"The Animals' Christmas Tree.\"    Silence! The story-teller turns his eyes from the glowing fire to the  faces of his eager audience. He is ready to begin.    Each season of the year opens a treasury of suggestion for stories. In  the beauty and wonder of nature are excellent themes for tales which  quicken children's interest in the promise of joyous springtime, in  the rich pageantry of ripening summer, in the blessings of generous  autumn, and in the merry cheer of grim old winter.    The Pearl Story Book is the fourth volume in a series of nature books  each of which emphasizes the interest and beauty characteristic of a  particular season.
