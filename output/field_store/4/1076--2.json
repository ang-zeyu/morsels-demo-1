OPTICKS:    OR, A    TREATISE    OF THE    _Reflections_, _Refractions_,  _Inflections_ and _Colours_    OF    LIGHT.    _The_ FOURTH EDITION, _corrected_.    By Sir _ISAAC NEWTON_, Knt.    LONDON:    Printed for WILLIAM INNYS at the West-End of St. _Paul's_. MDCCXXX.    TITLE PAGE OF THE 1730 EDITION          SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S ADVERTISEMENTS          Advertisement I      _Part of the ensuing Discourse about Light was written at the Desire of  some Gentlemen of the_ Royal-Society, _in the Year 1675, and then sent  to their Secretary, and read at their Meetings, and the rest was added  about twelve Years after to complete the Theory; except the third Book,  and the last Proposition of the Second, which were since put together  out of scatter'd Papers. To avoid being engaged in Disputes about these  Matters, I have hitherto delayed the printing, and should still have  delayed it, had not the Importunity of Friends prevailed upon me. If any  other Papers writ on this Subject are got out of my Hands they are  imperfect, and were perhaps written before I had tried all the  Experiments here set down, and fully satisfied my self about the Laws of  Refractions and Composition of Colours. I have here publish'd what I  think proper to come abroad, wishing that it may not be translated into  another Language without my Consent._    _The Crowns of Colours, which sometimes appear about the Sun and Moon, I  have endeavoured to give an Account of; but for want of sufficient  Observations leave that Matter to be farther examined. The Subject of  the Third Book I have also left imperfect, not having tried all the  Experiments which I intended when I was about these Matters, nor  repeated some of those which I did try, until I had satisfied my self  about all their Circumstances. To communicate what I have tried, and  leave the rest to others for farther Enquiry, is all my Design in  publishing these Papers._    _In a Letter written to Mr._ Leibnitz _in the year 1679, and published  by Dr._ Wallis, _I mention'd a Method by which I had found some general  Theorems about squaring Curvilinear Figures, or comparing them with the  Conic Sections, or other the simplest Figures with which they may be  compared. And some Years ago I lent out a Manuscript containing such  Theorems, and having since met with some Things copied out of it, I have  on this Occasion made it publick, prefixing to it an_ Introduction, _and  subjoining a_ Scholium _concerning that Method. And I have joined with  it another small Tract concerning the Curvilinear Figures of the Second  Kind, which was also written many Years ago, and made known to some  Friends, who have solicited the making it publick._                                            _I. N._    April 1, 1704.      Advertisement II    _In this Second Edition of these Opticks I have omitted the Mathematical  Tracts publish'd at the End of the former Edition, as not belonging to  the Subject. And at the End of the Third Book I have added some  Questions. And to shew that I do not take Gravity for an essential  Property of Bodies, I have added one Question concerning its Cause,  chusing to propose it by way of a Question, because I am not yet  satisfied about it for want of Experiments._                                            _I. N._    July 16, 1717.      Advertisement to this Fourth Edition    _This new Edition of Sir_ Isaac Newton's Opticks _is carefully printed  from the Third Edition, as it was corrected by the Author's own Hand,  and left before his Death with the Bookseller. Since Sir_ Isaac's  Lectiones Opticae, _which he publickly read in the University of_  Cambridge _in the Years 1669, 1670, and 1671, are lately printed, it has  been thought proper to make at the bottom of the Pages several Citations  from thence, where may be found the Demonstrations, which the Author  omitted in these_ Opticks.           *       *       *       *       *    Transcriber's Note: There are several greek letters used in the  descriptions of the illustrations. They are signified by [Greek:  letter]. Square roots are noted by the letters sqrt before the equation.           *       *       *       *       *    THE FIRST BOOK OF OPTICKS          _PART I._      My Design in this Book is not to explain the Properties of Light by  Hypotheses, but to propose and prove them by Reason and Experiments: In  order to which I shall premise the following Definitions and Axioms.          _DEFINITIONS_      DEFIN. I.    _By the Rays of Light I understand its least Parts, and those as well  Successive in the same Lines, as Contemporary in several Lines._ For it  is manifest that Light consists of Parts, both Successive and  Contemporary; because in the same place you may stop that which comes  one moment, and let pass that which comes presently after; and in the  same time you may stop it in any one place, and let it pass in any  other. For that part of Light which is stopp'd cannot be the same with  that which is let pass. The least Light or part of Light, which may be  stopp'd alone without the rest of the Light, or propagated alone, or do  or suffer any thing alone, which the rest of the Light doth not or  suffers not, I call a Ray of Light.      DEFIN. II.    _Refrangibility of the Rays of Light, is their Disposition to be  refracted or turned out of their Way in passing out of one transparent  Body or Medium into another. And a greater or less Refrangibility of  Rays, is their Disposition to be turned more or less out of their Way in  like Incidences on the same Medium._ Mathematicians usually consider the  Rays of Light to be Lines reaching from the luminous Body to the Body  illuminated, and the refraction of those Rays to be the bending or  breaking of those lines in their passing out of one Medium into another.  And thus may Rays and Refractions be considered, if Light be propagated  in an instant. But by an Argument taken from the AEquations of the times  of the Eclipses of _Jupiter's Satellites_, it seems that Light is  propagated in time, spending in its passage from the Sun to us about  seven Minutes of time: And therefore I have chosen to define Rays and  Refractions in such general terms as may agree to Light in both cases.      DEFIN. III.    _Reflexibility of Rays, is their Disposition to be reflected or turned  back into the same Medium from any other Medium upon whose Surface they  fall. And Rays are more or less reflexible, which are turned back more  or less easily._ As if Light pass out of a Glass into Air, and by being  inclined more and more to the common Surface of the Glass and Air,  begins at length to be totally reflected by that Surface; those sorts of  Rays which at like Incidences are reflected most copiously, or by  inclining the Rays begin soonest to be totally reflected, are most  reflexible.      DEFIN. IV.    _The Angle of Incidence is that Angle, which the Line described by the  incident Ray contains with the Perpendicular to the reflecting or  refracting Surface at the Point of Incidence._      DEFIN. V.    _The Angle of Reflexion or Refraction, is the Angle which the line  described by the reflected or refracted Ray containeth with the  Perpendicular to the reflecting or refracting Surface at the Point of  Incidence._      DEFIN. VI.    _The Sines of Incidence, Reflexion, and Refraction, are the Sines of the  Angles of Incidence, Reflexion, and Refraction._      DEFIN. VII    _The Light whose Rays are all alike Refrangible, I call Simple,  Homogeneal and Similar; and that whose Rays are some more Refrangible  than others, I call Compound, Heterogeneal and Dissimilar._ The former  Light I call Homogeneal, not because I would affirm it so in all  respects, but because the Rays which agree in Refrangibility, agree at  least in all those their other Properties which I consider in the  following Discourse.      DEFIN. VIII.    _The Colours of Homogeneal Lights, I call Primary, Homogeneal and  Simple; and those of Heterogeneal Lights, Heterogeneal and Compound._  For these are always compounded of the colours of Homogeneal Lights; as  will appear in the following Discourse.          _AXIOMS._      AX. I.    _The Angles of Reflexion and Refraction, lie in one and the same Plane  with the Angle of Incidence._      AX. II.    _The Angle of Reflexion is equal to the Angle of Incidence._      AX. III.    _If the refracted Ray be returned directly back to the Point of  Incidence, it shall be refracted into the Line before described by the  incident Ray._      AX. IV.    _Refraction out of the rarer Medium into the denser, is made towards the  Perpendicular; that is, so that the Angle of Refraction be less than the  Angle of Incidence._      AX. V.    _The Sine of Incidence is either accurately or very nearly in a given  Ratio to the Sine of Refraction._    Whence if that Proportion be known in any one Inclination of the  incident Ray, 'tis known in all the Inclinations, and thereby the  Refraction in all cases of Incidence on the same refracting Body may be  determined. Thus if the Refraction be made out of Air into Water, the  Sine of Incidence of the red Light is to the Sine of its Refraction as 4  to 3. If out of Air into Glass, the Sines are as 17 to 11. In Light of  other Colours the Sines have other Proportions: but the difference is so  little that it need seldom be considered.    [Illustration: FIG. 1]    Suppose therefore, that RS [in _Fig._ 1.] represents the Surface of  stagnating Water, and that C is the point of Incidence in which any Ray  coming in the Air from A in the Line AC is reflected or refracted, and I  would know whither this Ray shall go after Reflexion or Refraction: I  erect upon the Surface of the Water from the point of Incidence the  Perpendicular CP and produce it downwards to Q, and conclude by the  first Axiom, that the Ray after Reflexion and Refraction, shall be  found"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33508"],[0,"A New Subspecies of Lizard, Cnemidophorus sacki, from Michoacán, México (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                                   ~University of Kansas Publications~                         ~Museum of Natural History~                     Vol. 10, No. 9, pp. 587-598, 2 figs.

DUELLMAN      The systematic status of the populations of lizards assignable to  _Cnemidophorus sacki_ in western Mexico (Sonora southward to Jalisco)  has been reviewed in detail by Zweifel (1959, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.  Hist, 117 (2):57-116), who stated that the use of the specific name  _sacki_ for the western populations rests upon a reasonable, but as  yet unproved, assumption that intergradation occurs. Although Zweifel  examined specimens of the nominal subspecies from the upper Balsas  Basin, he did not study specimens from the intervening area--the  Tepalcatepec Valley in Michoacan.    Field studies and the examination of large series of preserved  specimens of _Cnemidophorus_ from the Tepalcatepec Valley show the  presence of _Cnemidophorus sacki_ in the region between the ranges of  _C. sacki sacki_ in the upper Balsas Basin and _C. sacki occidentalis_  in Jalisco and southern Nayarit. Furthermore, the populations of  _sacki_ inhabiting the Tepalcatepec Valley have characters of  scutellation and coloration that distinguish them from other described  subspecies of _sacki_. In recognition of the important contributions  to the systematics of the genus _Cnemidophorus_ made by Dr. Richard G.  Zweifel, I propose that the subspecies of _Cnemidophorus sacki_ in the  Tepalcatepec Valley be named as follows:                   +Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli+ new subspecies    _Holotype._--University of Michigan Museum of Zoology No. 119542, from  Capirio, Michoacan, Mexico (185 meters), an adult male, one of a  series collected on June 13, 1958, by William E. Duellman, Jerome B.  Tulecke, and John Wellman. Original number WED 12310.    _Paratopotypes._--UMMZ Nos. 119536-119541 and 119543-119550.    _Diagnosis._--A race of _Cnemidophorus sacki_ characterized by large  size (more than 130 mm. snout-vent length in males), approximately 106  dorsal granules around the midbody, about 41 femoral pores, and a  dorsal color-pattern in adult males consisting of lateral and  dorsolateral rows of spots, paravertebral rows fused with middorsal  light green area at least anteriorly, and pink throat having a median  light blue spot or transverse band.    _Description of Holotype._--Snout-vent length, 128 mm.; tail length,  252 mm.; tail/body ratio, 1.97; scutellation typical of _sacki_--four  supraoculars, enlarged postantebrachials, and enlarged mesoptychials;  107 granules around midbody (excluding enlarged ventrals); 45 femoral  pores; three enlarged preanal scales; supraorbital semicircle-series  extending anteriorly to posterior edge of frontal (Fig. 1).          [Illustration: Top View Head - Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli]    ~Fig. 1.~ Top view of the head of the holotype of _Cnemidophorus sacki      zweifeli_ (UMMZ 119542) showing scutellation. x5.      Top of head and nape dusty brown; tip of rostral and lateral edges of  superciliaries dark cream-color; upper labials and sides of head  anterior to eyes cream-color, mottled with blue; lower labials and  postocular region pale blue; mental, postmental, and sublabials  cream-color. Upper surfaces of forelimbs dull bluish gray, spotted  with pale greenish yellow; dorsal surfaces of proximal one-fourth of  tail light brownish gray turning to pale orange-brown posteriorly;  lateral surfaces of tail bluish gray anteriorly and creamy brown  posteriorly. Nuchal region light bluish gray; flanks dark gray; dorsal  ground-color dark brown, somewhat paler posteriorly. Body having a row  of cream-colored spots in place of a lateral stripe, and another row  in place of dorsolateral stripe; dorsally, large diffuse tan or light  green spots partially fused and tending to form irregular transverse  markings. Chin to posterior end of sublabials pale pink, bordered  posteriorly by bluish white area, and then pink. Mesoptychials, under  surfaces of hind limbs, and belly cream-colored; anterior edges of  belly scales dark blue; lateral two rows of ventrals on posterior  two-thirds of body dark blue having light blue or cream-colored spots.  Under surfaces of forelimbs bluish cream; ventral surface of tail  cream-colored.    _Variation in Size and Scutellation._--The largest male has a  snout-vent length of 132 mm., the largest female, 114 mm., and the  smallest juvenile, 34 mm. The number of dorsal granules at the midbody  varies from 91 to 117 (106.2 +- 0.43); the ratio of the number of  granules between the paravertebral stripes to the number of granules  around the body (PV/GAB) varies from 0.064 to 0.157 (0.097 +-0.007);  the number of femoral pores varies from 32 to 49 (41.1 +- 0.20).  Usually there are only three enlarged preanals, but 18 specimens have  a somewhat enlarged scale anterior to the normal complement of three.  In 15 specimens the supraorbital semicircle-series terminate short of  the posterior edge of the frontal; in the others the series reach the  frontal.    _Variation in Coloration._--The coloration of juveniles and subadults  varies little; large adults vary considerably especially in the amount  of diffusion of the light green middorsal area. In some individuals  the vertebral pale area does not include the paravertebral spots; in  other individuals the pale area includes not only the paravertebral  rows, but, at least anteriorly, the dorsolateral rows. In large males  of about equal size (and collected at the same time) there is  considerable variation in the amount of blue on the belly. In a few of  the males the belly is white with only the anterior edge of each scale  blue; in some only the lateral rows of ventrals on the posterior  two-thirds of the body are blue; in others all of the posterior  two-thirds of the belly is blue.    _Ontogenetic Change in Color Pattern._--The metamorphosis of color  pattern in _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ results in the dorsal  ground-color becoming paler with age, the replacement of the stripes  by spots, and finally in large males the suffusion of these spots.    A single hatchling (UMMZ 114732) is available; this specimen has a  prominent umbilical scar and a snout-vent length of 34 mm. The top of  the head is olive brown; the dorsal surfaces of the limbs are dark  brown with cream mottling; the dorsal ground-color is brownish black;  this is paler on the lower flanks. The lateral and dorsolateral  stripes are cream-colored; the paravertebral stripes are white. There  is a faint, diffuse vertebral stripe anteriorly (Fig. 2 A). The throat  and undersides of the limbs and tail are cream-colored; the belly is  bluish white. In life the stripes were pale yellowish green, and the  tip of the tail was pink.    In larger individuals the dorsal ground-color is dark brown; the  lower flanks are grayish tan. Light brown diffuse spots are present  in the lateral and dorsolateral dark fields. The tan vertebral stripe  is diffuse and nearly fills the paravertebral dark fields; the  paravertebral stripes are faint posteriorly; throughout their length  they are scalloped--the beginning of their fragmentation into spots  (Fig. 2 B).    In subadults (+- 80 mm. snout-vent length) the paravertebral stripes  are fragmented into spots posteriorly. Also, the dorsolateral stripes  in some individuals are fragmented posteriorly. The dorsolateral dark  fields are somewhat paler than the lateral dark fields. Cream-colored  spots are present on the flanks. The mottling on the thighs tends  towards the formation of light spots (Fig. 2 C).    In small adults (+- 100 mm. snout-vent length) the paravertebral  stripes are entirely fragmented into spots. The lateral and  dorsolateral stripes are broken into spots posteriorly. The middorsal  pale area (formed by the suffusion of the vertebral stripe) and  paravertebral and dorsolateral rows of spots are pale green. The  cream-colored spots on the flanks are expanded to form vertical bars  (Fig. 2 D).    Large adult males (+- 120 mm. snout-vent length) have all of the  stripes fragmented into spots. The diffuse middorsal area is expanded  and encloses the paravertebral rows of spots. The pale spots present  in the dark fields in smaller individuals are either absent or fused  with spots resulting from the fragmentation of the stripes (Fig. 2 E).    _Sexual dimorphism._--Males attain a larger size (known maximum  snout-vent length of 132 mm., as compared with 114 mm. in females).  Males have larger but not more numerous, femoral pores, blue bellies,  and pink and blue throats, whereas females are unicolor creamy white  ventrally.
