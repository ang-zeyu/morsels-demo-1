It suggested that he felt life's  difficulties more keenly than a man should at that age. But it may  have been that this was a necessary part of the keenness with which  the whole of life appealed to him; its good things, as well as its  worries.    He rose from his writing-table and straightened his back with a  long sigh, clenching both hands tightly, and stretching both arms  over his shoulders, as he moved across the little room to its  window. The window gave him an extensive view of dully gleaming  roofs and chimney-pots, seen through driving sleet, towards the end  of a raw forenoon in February. The roofs he saw were those of one  of London's cheap suburbs; first, a block of \"mansions\" similar to  those in which his own flat was situated; then a rather superior  block, where the rents were much cheaper because they were called  \"dwellings\"; and beyond that, the huddled small houses of a quarter  with which no builder had interfered since early Victorian days.    [Illustration]    The man turned away from the dripping window, and looked round this  den in which he worked. Its walls were mostly covered by  book-shelves, but in the gaps between the shelves there were pictures; a  rather odd mixture of pictures, of men and women and dogs. The men  and women were mostly people who had written books, and the dogs  were without exception Irish Wolfhounds; those fine animals which  combine in themselves the fleetness of the greyhound, the strength  of the boarhound, and the picturesque, wiry shaggyness of the  deerhound; those animals whose history goes back to the beginning  of the Christian era; through all the storied ages in which they  were the friends and companions of kings and princes, great  chieftains and mighty hunters.    For several minutes the man paused before a picture, underneath  which was written: \"The Mistress of the Kennels.\" This picture  showed a girl with wind-blown hair, happy face, and laughing eyes,  standing, with a small puppy in her arms, in the midst of a wide  kennel enclosure on the sloping rise of an upland meadow. In the  background one saw a comfortable-looking house, half hidden by two  huge walnut trees, and flanked by a row of aged elms. When the man  had looked his fill at this picture, and at other pictures of  various Irish Wolfhounds, each marked with the name and age of the  hound depicted, he sighed, and went to the window again. While he  stood there, looking out through the February sleet, the door of  the den opened, and the Mistress of the Kennels came in, wearing a  big, loose overall, or pinafore, which covered her dress  completely. Her face had not quite the colour which the picture  made one feel it must have had when she stood in that wide,  windy, kennel enclosure; but it was still a sunny face; the eyes  were still laughing eyes; a loving, lovable face, one felt, even  though London had robbed it of some of its open-air freshness. She  walked up to the man's side, and, seeing the expression on his face  as he gazed out over the wet roofs, she said--    \"Yes, it is, rather--isn't it?--after Croft.\"    \"Oh, don't talk of Croft, child, or you'll bring my spring madness  upon me before its time. I have had hints of it this morning, as it  is. It seems almost incredible that we have only been two years and  four months away from Croft, and the old open life. I was looking  at the picture of the Mistress of the Kennels just now. Do you  remember that morning? Tara's first litter hadn't long been weaned.  My goodness, the air was sweet in that meadow! That was the morning  poor old crippled Eileen ran the rabbit down, you remember.\"    \"Yes, and it was old Tara's third day out, after that awful  illness. Well, well, it's a blessed thing to know that the old dear  is happy, and has such a lovely home down in Devonshire, isn't it?\"    \"Yes, oh yes; I know it might have been worse, and I'm a brute to  be discontented, but--two and a half years! Why, it seems more like  twenty, since we lived in a place where you could lean out of the  window and drink the air; where I could go outside in my pyjamas  before tubbing in the morning, and see the dogs, and set the  rabbits flying in the orchard. Two years and four months. Do you  know, if we give spring madness half a chance this year, it strikes  me it will lead us out of this huddled, pent-in town, out to the  open again. I almost think we could manage it now. I hardly seem to  have lifted my nose from that table since last summer; but it's  true the bank book shows small results as yet.\"    \"And four years was to be the minimum, wasn't it?  We thought of  five, at first.\"    \"Yes, yes; I know. My idea was that we would not go back till it  seemed sure we should be able really to stay; no more returns to  town with our tails between our legs. But, all the same, when I  look out of that window--if we _really_ lived cottage style, you  know.\"    \"But should we? Cottages don't have kennels, you know; not  Wolfhound kennels, anyhow.\"    \"I know. Oh, of course, it would be quite unjustifiable, quite mad;  but--I thought I felt signs of spring madness when I looked out of  that window this morning.\"    \"Oh, well! Now do you know what I came in for?  I came to tell you  that this is the last day of the Dog Show at the Agricultural Hall.  You remember that I have to go over to Mrs. Kenneth's this  afternoon, and I think it would be a good plan for you to take an  afternoon off and go to the Show. If you don't, it will be the  third year you have missed it. I really think you ought to go. It  will do you good.\"    \"H'm! I should hardly have thought a Dog Show was a good thing for  spring madness and the change fever; rather dangerous, I should  have thought,\" said the man, with a queer little twisted smile.    \"Oh, yes; I think it is all right; quite bracing; a sort of trial  of strength; and quite safe, because we know that madness in that  direction is simply and altogether impossible. You have been  working too hard; and besides, it will do you good to meet the  people. You will see a lot of the youngsters we reared; there are  three champions among them now. Do go!\"    A little more than an hour later he was on his way to the Dog Show,  at which, in other days, he had been one of the principal  exhibitors. A bout of ill-health, combined with consequent  diminution of earnings, and a characteristic habit of doing things  on a more generous scale than his income justified, had led to a  break-up of his country home, with its big kennels and stabling,  and a descent upon London in pursuit of economical living and  increased earnings. Parting with the kennels and their inhabitants  had been the severest wrench of all; and it is probable that, even  in the mean little town flat, room would have been found for Tara,  the well-loved mother of Irish Wolfhound heroes, but for the  special circumstance that an excellent home had been offered for  her in Devonshire.

I & II now ready    (_Schmidt's Educational Series No. 257-a, b_)    Price $1.00 each volume          Preface      Although \"of the making of books there is no end,\" this book, on so  human a subject as music, we believe should justify itself. A  twenty-years' experience in teaching the Appreciation of Music at  Harvard University and Radcliffe College has convinced the author that  a knowledge of musical grammar and structure does enable us, as the  saying is, to get more out of music. This conviction is further  strengthened by the statement of numerous students who testify that  after analyzing certain standard compositions their attitude towards  music has changed and their love for it greatly increased.    In the illustrations (published in a Supplementary Volume) no  concessions have been made to so-called \"popular taste\"; people have  an instinctive liking for the best when it is fairly put before them.  We are not providing a musical digest, since music requires _active  cooperation_ by the hearer, nor are we trying to interpret music in  terms of the other arts. Music is itself. For those who may be  interested in speculating as to the connection between music and art,  numerous books are available--some of them excellent from their point  of view.    This book concerns itself with music _as_ music. It is assumed that,  if anyone really loves this art, he is willing and glad to do serious  work to quicken his sense of hearing, to broaden his imagination, and  to strengthen his memory so that he may become intelligent in  appreciation rather than merely absorbed in honeyed sounds. Music is  of such power and glory that we should be ready to devote to its study  as much time as to a foreign language. In the creed of the music-lover  the first and last article is familiarity. When we thoroughly know a  composition so that its themes sing in our memory and we feel at home  in the structure, the music will speak to us directly, and all books  and analytical comments will be of secondary importance--those of the  present writer not excepted. Special effort has been made to select  illustrations of musical worth, and upon these the real emphasis in  study should be laid.    The material of the book is based on lectures, often of an informal  nature, in the Appreciation Course at Harvard University and lays no  claim to original research. The difficulty in establishing points of  approach makes it far more baffling to speak or write about music than  about the other arts. Music is sufficient unto itself. Endowed with  the insight of a Ruskin or a Pater, one may say something worth while  about painting. But in music the line between mere statistical  analysis and sentimental rhapsody must be drawn with exceeding care.  If the subject matter be clearly presented and the analyses  true--allowance being made for honest difference of opinion--every  hope will be realized.    The author's gratitude is herewith expressed to Mr. Percy Lee Atherton  for his critical revision of the text and to Professor William C.  Heilman for valuable assistance in selecting and preparing the musical  illustrations.    W.R.S.    Cambridge, Massachusetts    _June_, 1919          Contents      I.

Music: an Art and a Language          CHAPTER I    PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS      In approaching the study of any subject we may fairly expect that this  subject shall be defined, although some one has ironically remarked  that every definition is a misfortune. Music-lovers, however, will  rejoice that their favorite art is spared such a misfortune, for it  can not be defined. We know the factors of which music is constituted,  rhythm and sound; and we can trace the historic steps by which methods  of presentation and of style have been so perfected that by means of  this twofold material the emotions and aspirations of human beings may  be expressed and permanently recorded. We realize, and with our inborn  equipment can appreciate, the moving power of music; but to define, in  the usual sense of the term definition, what music really is, will be  forever impossible. The fact indeed that music--like love, electricity  and other elemental forces--cannot be defined is its special glory. It  is a peculiar, mysterious power;[1] quite in a class by itself,  although with certain aspects which it shares with the other arts. The  writings of all the great poets, such as Milton, Shakespeare, Browning  and Whitman, abound in eloquent tributes to the power and influence of  music, but it is noticeable that no one attempts to define it. The  mystery of music must be approached with reverence and music must be  loved for itself with perfect sincerity.    [Footnote 1: For suggestive comments on this point see the essays  _Harmonie et Melodie_ by Saint-Saens, Chapters I and II.]    Some insight, however, may be gained into the nature of music by a  clear recognition of what it is _not_, and by a comparison with the  more definite and familiar arts. Music consists of the intangible and  elusive factors of rhythm and sound; in this way differing  fundamentally from the concrete static arts such as architecture,  sculpture and painting. Furthermore, instrumental music, _i.e._, music  freed from a dependence on words, is not an exact language like prose  and poetry. It speaks to our feelings and imaginations, as it were by  suggestion; reaching for this very reason depths of our being quite  beyond the power of mere words. No one can define rhythm except by  saying that rhythm, in the sense of motion, is the fundamental fact in  the universe and in all life, both physical and human. Everything in  the heavens above and in the earth beneath is in ceaseless motion and  change; nothing remains the same for two consecutive seconds. Even the  component parts of material--such as stone and wood, which we  ordinarily speak of as concrete and stationary--are whirling about  with ceaseless energy, and often in perfect rhythm. Thus we see how  natural and vital is the art of music, for it is inseparably connected  with life itself.    As for the other factor, sound is one of the most elemental and  mysterious of all physical phenomena.[2] When the air is set in motion  by the vibration of certain bodies of wood, metal and other material,  we know that sound waves, striking upon the tympanum of the ear,  penetrate to the brain and imagination. Sound is a reciprocal  phenomenon; for, even if there were systematic activity of vibrating  bodies, there could be no sound without some one to hear it.[3] Good  musicians are known for their power of keen and discriminating  hearing; and the ear,[4] as Saint-Saens says, is"]]]
