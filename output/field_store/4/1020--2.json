The caricature is truth slightly  exaggerated, and I must own that all my life I have been as fond of  animals in general and of cats in particular as any brahmin or old maid.  The great Byron always trotted a menagerie round with him, even when  travelling, and he caused to be erected, in the park of Newstead Abbey,  a monument to his faithful Newfoundland dog Boatswain, with an  inscription in verse of his own inditing. I cannot be accused of  imitation in the matter of our common liking for dogs, for that love  manifested itself in me at an age when I was yet ignorant of the  alphabet.    A clever man being at this time engaged in preparing a \"History of  Animals of Letters,\" I jot down these notes in which he may find, so far  as my own animals are concerned, trustworthy information.    The earliest remembrance of this sort that I have goes back to the time  of my arrival in Paris from Tarbes. I was then three years old, so that  it is difficult to credit the statement made by Mirecourt and Vapereau,  who affirm that I \"proved but an indifferent pupil\" in my native town.  Home-sickness of a violence that no one would credit a child with being  capable of experiencing, fell upon me. I spoke our local dialect only,  and people who talked French \"were not mine own people.\" I would wake in  the middle of the night and inquire whether we were not soon to start on  our return to our own land.    No dainty tempted me, no toy could amuse me. Drums and trumpets equally  failed to relieve my gloom. Among the objects and beings I regretted  figured a dog called Cagnotte, whom it had been found impossible to  bring with us. His absence told on me to such an extent that one  morning, having first chucked out of the window my little tin soldiers,  my German village with its painted houses, and my bright red fiddle, I  was about to take the same road to return as speedily as possible to  Tarbes, the Gascons, and Cagnotte. I was grabbed by the jacket in the  nick of time, and Josephine, my nurse, had the happy thought to tell me  that Cagnotte, tired of waiting for us, was coming that very day by the  stage-coach. Children accept the improbable with artless faith; nothing  strikes them as impossible; only, they must not be deceived, for there  is no impairing the fixity of a settled idea in their brains. I kept  asking, every fifteen minutes, whether Cagnotte had not yet come. To  quiet me, Josephine bought on the Pont-Neuf a little dog not unlike the  Tarbes specimen. I did not feel sure of its identity, but I was told  that travelling changed dogs very much. I was satisfied with the  explanation and accepted the Pont-Neuf dog as being the authentic  Cagnotte. He was very gentle, very amiable, and very well behaved. He  would lick my cheeks, and indeed his tongue was not above licking also  the slices of bread and butter cut for my afternoon tea. We lived on the  best of terms with each other.    Presently, however, the supposed Cagnotte became sad, troubled, and his  movements lost their freedom. He found it difficult to curl himself up,  lost his jolly agility, breathed hard and could not eat. One day, while  caressing him, I felt a seam that ran down his stomach, which was much  swelled and very tight. I called my nurse. She came, took a pair of  scissors cut the thread, and Cagnotte, freed of a sort of overcoat made  of curled lambskin, in which he had been tricked out by the Pont-Neuf  dealers to make him look like a poodle, appeared in all the wretched  guise and ugliness of a street cur, a worthless mongrel. He had grown  fat, and his scant garment was choking him. Once he was rid of his  carapace, he wagged his ears, stretched his limbs, and started romping  joyously round the room, caring nothing about being ugly so long as he  was comfortable. His appetite returned, and he made up by his moral  qualities for his lack of beauty. In Cagnotte's company I gradually  lost, for he was a genuine child of Paris, my remembrance of Tarbes and  of the high mountains visible from our windows; I learned French and I  also became a thorough-paced Parisian.    The reader is not to suppose that this is a story I have invented for  the sole purpose of entertaining him. It is literally true, and proves  that the dog-dealers of that day were quite as clever as horse-coupers  in the art of making up their animals and taking in purchasers.    After Cagnotte's death, my liking was rather for cats, on account of  their being more sedentary and fonder of the fireplace. I shall not  attempt to relate their history in detail. Dynasties of felines, as  numerous as the dynasties of Egyptian kings, succeeded each other in our  home. Accident, flight, or death accounted for them in turns. They were  all beloved and regretted; but life is made up of forgetfulness, and the  remembrance of cats passes away like the remembrance of men.    It is a sad thing that the life of these humble friends, of these  inferior brethren, should not be proportionate to that of their masters.    I shall do no more than mention an old gray cat that used to side with  me against my parents, and bit my mother's ankles when she scolded me or  seemed about to punish me, and come at once to Childebrand, a cat of the  Romanticist period. The name suffices to let my reader understand the  secret desire I felt to run counter to Boileau, whom I disliked then,  but with whom I have since made my peace. It will be remembered that  Nicolas says:--        \"Oh! ridiculous notion of poet ignorant      Who, of so many heroes, chooses Childebrand!\"    It seemed to me that the man was not so ignorant after all, since he had  selected a hero no one knew anything of; and, besides, Childebrand  struck me as a most long-haired, Merovingian, mediaeval, and Gothic name,  immeasurably preferable to any Greek name, such as Agamemnon, Achilles,  Idomeneus, Ulysses, or others of that sort. These were the ways of our  day, so far as the young fellows were concerned, at least: for never, to  quote the expression that occurs in the account of Kaulbach's frescoes  on the outer walls of the Pinacothek at Munich, never did the hydra of  \"wiggery\" (_perruquinisme_) erect its heads more fiercely, and no doubt  the Classicists called their cats Hector, Patrocles, or Ajax.    Childebrand was a splendid gutter-cat, short-haired, striped black and  tan, like the trunks worn by Saltabadil in \"le Roi s'amuse.\" His great  green eyes with their almond-shaped pupils, and his regular velvet  stripes, gave him a distant tigerish look that I liked. \"Cats are the  tigers of poor devils,\" I once wrote. Childebrand enjoyed the honour of  entering into some verses of mine, again because I wanted to tease  Boileau:--    \"Then shall I describe to you that picture by Rembrandt, that pleased me  so much; and my cat Childebrand, as is his habit, on my knees resting,  and anxiously up at me gazing, shall follow the motions of my finger as  in the air it sketches the story to make it clear.\"    Childebrand came in well by way of a rime to Rembrandt, for the verses  were meant for a Romanticist profession of faith addressed to a friend,  since deceased, and in those days as enthusiastic an admirer of Victor  Hugo, Sainte-Beuve, and Alfred de Musset as I was.    I am compelled to say of my cats what Don Ruy Gomez de Silva said to Don  Carlos, when the latter became impatient at the enumeration of the  former's ancestors, beginning with Don Silvius \"who thrice was Consul of  Rome,\" that is, \"I pass over a number, and of the greatest,\" and I shall  come to Madame-Theophile, a red cat with white breast, pink nose, and  blue eyes, so called because she lived with me on a footing of conjugal  intimacy. She slept on the foot of my bed, snoozed on the arm of my  chair while I was writing, came down to the garden and accompanied me  on my walks, sat at meals with me and not infrequently appropriated the  morsels on their way from my plate to my mouth.    One day a friend of mine, who was going out of town for a few days,  intrusted his parrot to me with the request that I would take care of it  during his absence. The bird, feeling strange in my house, had climbed,  helping himself with his beak, to the very top of his perch, and looking  pretty well bewildered, rolled round his eyes, that resembled the gilt  nails on arm-chairs, and wrinkled the whitish membrane that served him  for eyelids. Madame-Theophile had never seen a parrot, and she was  evidently much puzzled by the strange bird. Motionless as an Egyptian  mummy cat in its net-work of bands, she gazed upon it with an air of  profound meditation, and put together whatever she had been able to pick  up of natural history "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30775"],[0,"Elements of Chemistry, (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net                ELEMENTS    OF    CHEMISTRY,    IN A    NEW SYSTEMATIC ORDER,    CONTAINING ALL THE    MODERN DISCOVERIES.      ILLUSTRATED WITH THIRTEEN COPPERPLATES.

EDINBURGH: PRINTED FOR WILLIAM CREECH, AND SOLD IN LONDON BY G. G. AND  J. J. ROBINSONS.    MDCCXC.    ************************************************************************  Transcriber's note: Tables needed to be split to fit space  constraints.

The italic markup for single italized  letters (such as variables in equations) and weight abbreviations are  deleted for easier reading.  ************************************************************************          ADVERTISEMENT OF THE TRANSLATOR.      The very high character of Mr Lavoisier as a chemical philosopher, and  the great revolution which, in the opinion of many excellent chemists,  he has effected in the theory of chemistry, has long made it much  desired to have a connected account of his discoveries, and of the new  theory he has founded upon the modern experiments written by himself.  This is now accomplished by the publication of his Elements of  Chemistry; therefore no excuse can be at all necessary for giving the  following work to the public in an English dress; and the only  hesitation of the Translator is with regard to his own abilities for the  task. He is most ready to confess, that his knowledge of the composition  of language fit for publication is far inferior to his attachment to  the subject, and to his desire of appearing decently before the judgment  of the world.    He has earnestly endeavoured to give the meaning of the Author with the  most scrupulous fidelity, having paid infinitely greater attention to  accuracy of translation than to elegance of stile. This last indeed, had  he even, by proper labour, been capable of attaining, he has been  obliged, for very obvious reasons, to neglect, far more than accorded  with his wishes. The French copy did not reach his hands before the  middle of September; and it was judged necessary by the Publisher that  the Translation should be ready by the commencement of the University  Session at the end of October.    He at first intended to have changed all the weights and measures used  by Mr Lavoisier into their correspondent English denominations, but,  upon trial, the task was found infinitely too great for the time  allowed; and to have executed this part of the work inaccurately, must  have been both useless and misleading to the reader. All that has been  attempted in this way is adding, between brackets ( ), the degrees of  Fahrenheit's scale corresponding with those of Reaumeur's thermometer,  which is used by the Author. Rules are added, however, in the Appendix,  for converting the French weights and measures into English, by which  means the reader may at any time calculate such quantities as occur,  when desirous of comparing Mr Lavoisier's experiments with those of  British authors.    By an oversight, the first part of the translation went to press without  any distinction being preserved between charcoal and its simple  elementary part, which enters into chemical combinations, especially  with oxygen or the acidifying principle, forming carbonic acid. This  pure element, which exists in great plenty in well made charcoal, is  named by Mr Lavoisier _carbone_, and ought to have been so in the  translation; but the attentive reader can very easily rectify the  mistake. There is an error in Plate XI. which the engraver copied  strictly from the original, and which was not discovered until the plate  was worked off at press, when that part of the Elements which treats of  the apparatus there represented came to be translated. The two tubes 21.  and 24. by which the gas is conveyed into the bottles of alkaline  solution 22. 25. should have been made to dip into the liquor, while the  other tubes 23. and 26. which carry off the gas, ought to have been cut  off some way above the surface of the liquor in the bottles.    A few explanatory notes are added; and indeed, from the perspicuity of  the Author, very few were found necessary. In a very small number of  places, the liberty has been taken of throwing to the bottom of the  page, in notes, some parenthetical expressions, only relative to the  subject, which, in their original place, tended to confuse the sense.  These, and the original notes of the Author, are distinguished by the  letter A, and to the few which the Translator has ventured to add, the  letter E is subjoined.    Mr Lavoisier has added, in an Appendix, several very useful Tables for  facilitating the calculations now necessary in the advanced state of  modern chemistry, wherein the most scrupulous accuracy is required. It  is proper to give some account of these, and of the reasons for omitting  several of them.    No. I. of the French Appendix is a Table for converting ounces, gros,  and grains, into the decimal fractions of the French pound; and No. II.  for reducing these decimal fractions again into the vulgar subdivisions.  No. III. contains the number of French cubical inches and decimals which  correspond to a determinate weight of water.    The Translator would most readily have converted these Tables into  English weights and measures; but the necessary calculations must have  occupied a great deal more time than could have been spared in the  period limited for publication. They are therefore omitted, as  altogether useless, in their present state, to the British chemist.    No. IV. is a Table for converting lines or twelfth parts of the inch,  and twelfth parts of lines, into decimal fractions, chiefly for the  purpose of making the necessary corrections upon the quantities of  gasses according to their barometrical pressure. This can hardly be at  all useful or necessary, as the barometers used in Britain are graduated  in decimal fractions of the inch, but, being referred to by the Author  in the text, it has been retained, and is No. I. of the Appendix to  this Translation.    No. V. Is a Table for converting the observed heights of water within  the jars used in pneumato-chemical experiments into correspondent  heights of mercury for correcting the volume of gasses. This, in Mr  Lavoisier's Work, is expressed for the water in lines, and for the  mercury in decimals of the inch, and consequently, for the reasons given  respecting the Fourth Table, must have been of no use. The Translator  has therefore calculated a Table for this correction, in which the water  is expressed in decimals, as well as the mercury. This Table is No. II.  of the English Appendix.    No. VI. contains the number of French cubical inches and decimals  contained in the corresponding ounce-measures used in the experiments of  our celebrated countryman Dr Priestley. This Table, which forms No. III.  of the English Appendix, is retained, with the addition of a column, in  which the corresponding English cubical inches and decimals are  expressed.    No. VII. Is a Table of the weights of a cubical foot and inch, French  measure, of the different gasses expressed in French ounces, gros,  grains, and decimals. This, which forms No. VI. of the English Appendix,  has been, with considerable labour, calculated into English weight and  measure.    No. VIII. Gives the specific gravities of a great number of bodies, with  columns, containing the weights of a cubical foot and inch, French  measure, of all the substances. The specific gravities of this Table,  which is No. VII. of the English Appendix, are retained, but the  additional columns, as useless to the British philosopher, are omitted;  and to have converted these into English denominations must have  required very long and painful calculations.    Rules are subjoined, in the Appendix to this translation, for converting  all the weights and measures used by Mr Lavoisier into corresponding  English denominations; and the Translator is proud to acknowledge his  obligation to the learned Professor of Natural Philosophy in the  University of Edinburgh, who kindly supplied him with the necessary  information for this purpose. A Table is likewise added, No. IV. of the  English Appendix, for converting the degrees of Reaumeur's scale used by  Mr Lavoisier into the corresponding degrees of Fahrenheit, which is  universally employed in Britain[1].    This Translation is sent into the world with the utmost diffidence,  tempered, however, with this consolation, that, though it must fall  greatly short of the elegance, or even propriety of language, which  every writer ought to endeavour to attain, it cannot fail of advancing  the interests of true chemical science, by disseminating the accurate  mode of analysis adopted by its justly celebrated Author. Should the  public call for a second edition, every care shall be taken to correct  the forced imperfections of the present translation, and to improve the  work by valuable additional matter from other authors of reputation in  the several subjects treated of.
