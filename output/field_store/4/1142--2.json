November 30, 2010    Since 2004, The World Factbook Web site has been updated on a  bi-weekly schedule. Culminating a three-month trial effort, we are  pleased to announce that the Factbook will now be updated on a  weekly basis.        November 19, 2010    Significant updates entered under the People, Government, and  Communications categories.        November 11, 2010    In the Geography category, a new subfield, \"volcanism,\" has been  added under the \"Natural hazards\" field for countries with  historically active volcanoes. The Economy section has been updated  to reflect the most recent data for 2009 and earlier years.        November 05, 2010    In the Economy category, the \"Oil - exports,\" \"Oil - imports,\" \"Oil  - proved reserves,\" and \"Natural gas - proved reserves\" fields have  been updated with the most recent estimates available.        October 29, 2010    In the People category, significant updates have been made to the  \"School life expectancy\" and \"Education expenditures\" fields. In the  Economy category, the \"Stock of domestic credit\" field has been  updated to include data for 2009. In addition, the definition has  been expanded to include credit provided by all financial  institutions, not just banks, as had been The World Factbook  practice until now. For some countries this change significantly  broadens the coverage.        October 22, 2010    The dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles has resulted in two new  World Factbook entries: the autonomous entities of Curacao and Sint  Maarten (the remaining three islands - Bonaire, Saba, and Sint  Eustatius - have joined the Netherlands as special municipalities).  The number of entities in The World Factbook now stands at 267.        October 13, 2010    In the Economy category, the \"Stock of money\" and \"Stock of quasi  money\" fields have been updated and renamed as \"Stock of narrow  money\" and \"Stock of broad money\" in keeping with the International  Monetary Fund's new presentation of monetary data. This new format  provides greater standardization of reporting and permits more  consistent comparisons across countries. Please see \"Definitions and  Notes\" (under the References tab) for descriptions of the new fields.        October 08, 2010    In the Communications category, the \"Internet hosts\" field has been  updated with 2010 data; significant updates entered in the  Geography, Government, and Military categories.

ERNST LEITZ.            New Constructions.      Since issueing our last catalogue, a number of new apparatus and  accessories have been added. The following are the more important ones:    1. A completely =new stand \"A\"= with extra fine micrometerscrew  transmitting its movement directly to the tube. The stand is of elegant  appearance and large dimensions, making it especially well adapted for  work in photo-micrography.    2. =Stand I= is now fitted out with the new special fine adjustment (each  division {1/1000} mm).    3. =Stand II= with round centering stage.    4. =Stand IV= is replaced by a model of larger size.    5. =Photo-micrographic apparatus= for use in horizontal and vertical  position, having joint for inclination, large size bellows and  plateholder.    6. =Large projection-apparatus= for electric lamp of 30 Ampere with triple  collecting lens of 210 mm aperture.    7. =Objective 1 a= with adjustable mounting and changeable magnification.  It is an excellent objective of low power for general purposes, having a  comparatively short working distance.    8. =Objective 1 b= with changeable magnification of lowest power, as far  down as two diameters. It serves for drawing extended sections and  specimens.    9. =Saccharimeter after Mitcherlich= improved form.    10. =Trichinoscope=, projection-apparatus of strong and simple  construction.            =Preface.=      Our American Branch house in New-York under the management of Mr. Wm.  Krafft has now been established for over 10 years. This period has  witnessed a gradual development of our business in the United States,  making it necessary to establish some years ago a Western Branch in  Chicago of which Mr. R. Gibson has charge.    The cordial reception our firm received has been most gratifying and we  take this opportunity to thank our many patrons for their kind  consideration.    It is our aim to co-operate with the scientists and construct new  apparatus to meet their needs or improve others wherever this is  possible.    The foregoing list of additions and improvements made since issueing our  last catalogue is proof that we spare no time nor labor to hold pace  with the increased wants of modern times.    We have now manufactured and sold over 71000 compound microscopes and  31000 oil immersion objectives, a large number of which are used in the  laboratories of Universities, Colleges, and other Educational  Institutions of the United States.    We are prepared at New-York and Chicago to repair our instruments or  make alterations at short notice and at lowest prices. The optical part  of a microscope should invariably be sent to the maker, as he is best in  a position to repair same and has an added interest to bring a lens back  to its original quality or even improve it.    Microscopes, bacteriological apparatus and all other scientific  instruments or preparations expressly imported for use in educational  institutions are exempt from duty.    Catalogues may be had on application by addressing:      =ERNST LEITZ,=      NEW-YORK               CHICAGO    411 West 59th Street   32 Clark, Cor. Lake Street.            =Objectives and Eye-pieces.=      In the manufacture of our objectives only such glass is employed as has  been subjected to the most rigid scientific tests. By these the exact  index of refraction and the exact degree of dispersion of the glass are  determined, and with these data available it is possible to very  perfectly correct both spherical and chromatic aberrations while still  making use of wide angular apertures in the objectives.    The precise mathematical calculation, combined with accurate  systematical working and testing methods, make it possible for us to  guarantee our objectives to be all of equal and excellent quality.    Every objective before leaving our hands, is subjected to the most  careful test, and only such lenses as are of the highest grade, are sent  out.    For the past seventeen years we have used glasses manufactured by Schott  & Co. of Jena. This glass has many points to recommend it for the  construction of optical instruments, and only such kinds are employed by  us, which have for many years been thoroughly tested as to their  durability.    Our lenses are therefore absolutely permanent. Objectives of the earlier  type which have become cloudy, we shall gladly repair.    [Illustration]    The three illustrations given above afford an idea of the plan of  construction of our achromatic objectives.    The first figure represents the plan of our low power objectives, and it  will be noted that they consist of two doublets, or triplets each  carefully corrected.    The central figure shows the construction of our high power dry  objectives. A hemispherical front lens is combined with two doublets or  sometimes triplets. The front lens is the chief magnifier of the  combination, while the other lenses serve to correct the various  aberrations.    The Oil-immersion, represented by the last illustration consists of a  front lens, hemispherical, behind which is a meniscus, which is in turn  followed by a doublet and a triplet, these latter acting as the  correcting lenses of the combination.    We manufacture both =Achromatic= and =Apochromatic objectives=. They differ  in that the glasses made use of in the apochromatics and the manner in  which they are combined permit a more perfect correction of chromatic  aberration. This advantage is not gained without a certain sacrifice of  simplicity in construction; by avoiding the use of flint glass having a  high refractive index and substituting materials to take the place of  crownglass. The apochromatics as a matter of fact do resolve the fine  markings of test objects (butterfly scales and diatomes) somewhat more  clearly than the achromatics, but the difference is slight and in  ordinary stained microscope preparations is hardly detectable.    The correction of both achromatics and apochromatics is complete. The  ordinary Huyghenian eye-pieces are consequently well adapted for use  with the objectives of either construction. Only with the highest powers  is it desirable to make use of the so-called \"compensation\" eye-pieces.    The achromatics and Huyghenian eye-pieces are also well adapted to the  requirements of photomicrography, special objectives being unnecessary  for this purpose. This statement is substantiated by the excellent  results obtained with our achromatic objectives, as shown in the  photomicrographs accompanying our brochure on  Photomicrography:--\"Anleitung zur Mikrophotographie\".    In making use of the higher power objectives--from No. 5 on--it should  be remembered, that the lenses are corrected for cover glasses of 0,17  mm in thickness and for a microscope tube-length of 170 mm. When using  the oil-immersion objectives it is particularly desirable, that this  exact tube length should be employed. With a view to facilitate the  adjustment of the tube-length the draw tubes of all our larger stands  are graduated in millimeters, the scale indicating the exact length of  the microscope tube in any given position of the draw tube. In this  connection it should be remembered, that the width of the collar of the  nose-pieces is 15 millimeters, and that consequently, when a nose-piece  is attached to the tube the reading of the draw tube scale should be 155  mm instead of 170 when the adjustment is proper.    [Illustration: Figure comparative merits of the dry and immersion  systems.]    The above sketch may serve to make clear the advantages of the immersion  objectives over those of the dry series. It is intended to represent  diagrammatically a section through a cover-glass and the front lens of  an objective, one half of the figure representing the conditions present  in the case of the Oil-immersion, the other those which are present in  the dry objectives. It will be noticed that by the interposition of a  drop of "]]]
