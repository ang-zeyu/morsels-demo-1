As the twilight, often hastened by the  soft blur of falling snow, encroaches more and more upon the brief  day, we gather closely about our firesides, and there, heart to heart,  are wont to listen as at no other period of this prosaic nineteenth  century life, to tales of olden time. More than ever are we drawn  together at the season of our Saviour's birth, when the yule log glows  amain and the sweet spirit of Christmas kindles within us a warmth and  gladness that responds to the cheerful blaze upon the hearth.    Christmas day! Does it not grow dearer to us every year? The summers  come and go; we rush to and fro on our little errands of business and  pleasure; great joys dawn in our lives, dark shadows of bitter  disappointment creep over them; we are glad, sorrowful, eager, weary,  well, ill; Life's heart beats strongly, and Death is busy in its  midst; we strive for the Beautiful, the True, and the Good; we hide  our faces in helpless agony of shame and remorse; yet again comes the  dear Day of days, with its blessed associations, memories, hopes.    CHRISTMAS! Do you remember what that word meant to you when you were a  child? What a mysterious halo of light surrounded the day! How the  very sound of its name suggested the fragrance of the fir-tree and  wax-candles and marvelous toys, and the far-off tinkle of sleigh  bells, or beat of tiny reindeer hoofs upon the snowy roof! Has the  approach of Christmas but an indifferent charm in this grown-up  work-a-day world of ours? If so, let us strive and pray for those  delicate sensibilities of childhood that caught and reveled in the  fragrant atmosphere of the day; that could hear, knowing naught beyond  the bliss it brought, the voice of the Founder of Christmas blessing  little children as it blessed them in distant Palestine eighteen  centuries ago. Let us forgive our debtors this day as we would be  forgiven; let no child's cry fall unheeded on our ears; let our hearts  be open to the tenderest, purest, most sacred thoughts, and to every  ennobling influence; let us be alert and watchful, on this bright  morning-day of the year; let the sun shine into and through us,  shedding its warmth and brightness upon all about us; let us be once  more as little children, and put out our hands trustingly, to be led.    _Hope--Joy--Bethlehem--Christmas--Christ!_ How softly the words chime  together, like Christmas bells! With their sweet music comforting and  gladdening our hearts, may we gather by the fireside to-night, to  listen to these simple tales                                                AROUND THE YULE LOG.          II    THE SHADOW OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT      I    It was at precisely eight o'clock, on the evening of the twenty-fourth  of December, that Mr. Broadstreet yawned, glanced at the time-piece,  closed the book he had been reading, and stretched himself out  comfortably in his smoking-chair before the cannel fire which snapped  and rustled cosily in the broad grate. The book was \"A Christmas  Carol,\" and the reader, familiar as he was with its pages, had been  considerably affected by that portion relating to Tiny Tim, as well as  cheered by the joyful notes with which the Carol ends.    For some minutes he sat silently surveying the pattern on his  slippers, and apparently working it out again on his own brow. Now,  Mr. Broadstreet was not a man to act upon impulse. A lawyer in large  and profitable practice, and a shrewd man of business as well, he was  never known to do, say, or decide anything without deliberation.    \"Hold on a bit,\" he would say to an eager client, \"softly, softly, my  friend, you're too fast for me. Now, what did you say was done with  the property?\" and so on to the end of the story. If there was any  money in the case, Mr. Broadstreet was pretty sure to draw it out, for  the benefit of his clients, and, remotely of course, himself.    \"When I put my hand _down_,\" he was fond of remarking, with  significant gesture upon the office desk, \"I never take it up again  without something in it.\"    In the course of his long practice, aided by a series of fortunate  speculations, he had amassed such a goodly sum that his name stood  near the head of the list of \"Our Prominent Taxpayers;\" he drove a  fine span of horses, and was free enough with his money, in a general  way. That is, when some large philanthropic movement was on foot,  Alonzo M. Broadstreet, Esq., was pretty sure to be down for a round  sum. He paid his share in church and politics, and annually sent a  check to the Board of Foreign Missions. He made it a rule, however,  never to encourage pauperism by promiscuous almsgiving, and never  tried a case or gave legal advice, for love. Poor people who called at  his office for assistance always found him unaccountably busy, and  street beggars had long since learned to skip his door on their  morning basket-visits.    To-night Mr. Broadstreet had picked up the \"Carol\" in a specially  complacent mood. He had spent liberally in Christmas gifts for his  wife and children, letting himself almost defy his better judgment by  purchasing for the former an expensive pin she had seen and fancied in  a show window the week before. Just as he had completed the bargain a  rescript had come down from the Supreme Court affirming judgment in  his favor in a case which meant at least a five-thousand-dollar fee.    Notwithstanding the memory of his recent good luck, he continued, on  this particular evening, of all evenings in the year, to knit his  brows and give unmistakable evidence that some emotion or reflection,  not altogether pleasant, was stirring him powerfully.    \"Nonsense!\" said Mr. Broadstreet presently, half aloud, as if he were  addressing some one in the center of the glowing coals. \"Nonsense!\" he  repeated, looking hard at a grotesque, carved figure that supported  the mantel: \"I'm _not_ like Scrooge. I give freely and I spend freely.  That fire don't look much like the one old Scrooge warmed his gruel  over, does it now?\"    The marble figure making no answer to this appeal, but continuing his  stony gaze, Mr. Broadstreet shifted his position again uneasily.  \"Don't I give away hundreds of dollars every year to the Societies,  and haven't I left them a round ten thousand in my will? Won't  somebody mourn for _me_, eh?\"    But the carved lips replied never a word, only seeming to curl  slightly as the firelight played upon them, thereby assuming such an  unpleasantly scornful expression that Mr. Broadstreet began to feel  more uncomfortable than ever.    Rising hastily from his chair and throwing the book down upon the  table, he walked on to the window, rubbed a little place clear upon  the frosty pane, and looked out.    The night was gloomy enough to make the plainest of homes seem cheery  by contrast. Since morning the skies had been dully gray, so that  every one who went out wore arctics and carried umbrellas, and was  provoked because no storm came. At about the time when the sun might  be supposed to be setting, somewhere behind that dismal wall of  clouds, a few tiny, shivering flakes had come floating down or up, one  could hardly tell which, and had mingled with the dust that, driven by  the biting wind, had filled the air, and piled itself in little ridges  along the sidewalk, and blinded the eyes of men and beasts throughout  the dreary day. Before long the snow overcame the low-born friend with  whom it had at first treacherously allied itself, laid it prostrate on  the earth, and calling in all its forces rioted victoriously over the  field. The storm now took full possession of the city, whitening roofs  and pavements, muffling every footfall and wheel-rattle, filling the  streets up to their slaty brims with whirling mists of sleety snow,  and roaring furiously through the tree-tops and around corners. As Mr.  Broadstreet gazed through his frosty loophole, with mind full of the  story he had just finished, he almost fancied he could discern the  shadowy forms of old Marley and his fellow-ghosts moaning and wringing  their hands as they swept past in trailing white robes.    He turned away with a half-shiver and once more ensconced himself in  his warm easy chair, taking up the Carol as he did so, and turning its  leaves carelessly until he came to a picture of the Ghost of Christmas  Present. It was wonderfully well-drawn, following the text with great  care, hitting off the idea of the jovial, holly-crowned Spirit to the  very life. And then the heap of good things that lay in generous piles  about the room! Mr. Broadstreet could almost catch a whiff of  fragrance from the turkeys and geese and spicy boughs. Indeed, so  strong was the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43048"],[0,"The Piebald Hippogriff (#1)"],[1,"Piebald Hippogriff                                By KAREN ANDERSON        [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Fantastic Stories      of Imagination May 1962.

But a few more       incisive cameos of fantasy such as this, and Mr. Anderson may come       to be identified as Karen's husband._      The edge of the world is fenced off stoutly enough, but the fence isn't  made that will stop a boy. Johnny tossed his pack and coil of rope over  it and started climbing. The top three strands were barbed wire. He  caught his shirt as he went over, and had to stop for a moment to ease  himself off. Then he dropped lightly to the grass on the other side.    The pack had landed in a clump of white clover. A cloud of disturbed  bees hung above, and he snatched it away quickly lest they should notice  the honeycomb inside.    For a minute he stood still, looking out over the edge. This was  different from looking through the fence, and when he moved it was  slowly. He eased himself to the ground where a corner of rock rose clear  of the thick larkspur and lay on his belly, the stone hard and cool  under his chin, and looked down.    The granite cliff curved away out of sight, and he couldn't see if it  had a foot. He saw only endless blue, beyond, below, and on both sides.  Clouds passed slowly.    Directly beneath him there was a ledge covered with long grass where  clusters of stars bloomed on tall, slender stalks.    He uncoiled his rope and found a stout beech tree not too close to the  edge. Doubling the rope around the bole, he tied one end around his  waist, slung the pack on his back, and belayed himself down the cliff.  Pebbles clattered, saxifrage brushed his arms and tickled his ears; once  he groped for a hold with his face in a patch of rustling ferns.    The climb was hard, but not too much. Less than half an hour later he  was stretched out on the grass with stars nodding about him. They had a  sharp, gingery smell. He lay in the cool shadow of the world's edge for  a while, eating apples and honeycomb from his pack. When he was finished  he licked the honey off his fingers and threw the apple cores over,  watching them fall into the blue.    Little islands floated along, rocking gently in air eddies. Sunlight  flashed on glossy leaves of bushes growing there. When an island drifted  into the shadow of the cliff, the blossoming stars shone out. Beyond the  shadows, deep in the light-filled gulf, he saw the hippogriffs at play.           *       *       *       *       *    There were dozens of them, frisking and cavorting in the air. He gazed  at them full of wonder. They pretended to fight, stooped at one another,  soared off in long spirals to stoop and soar and stoop again. One  flashed by him, a golden palomino that shone like polished wood. The  wind whistled in its wings.    Away to the left, the cliff fell back in a wide crescent, and nearly  opposite him a river tumbled over the edge. A pool on a ledge beneath  caught most of the water, and there were hippogriffs drinking. One side  of the broad pool was notched. The overflow fell sheer in a white plume  blown sideways by the wind.    As the sun grew hotter, the hippogriffs began to settle and browse on  the islands that floated past. Not far below, he noticed, a dozen or so  stood drowsily on an island that was floating through the cliff's shadow  toward his ledge. It would pass directly below him.    With a sudden resolution, Johnny jerked his rope down from the tree  above and tied the end to a projecting knob on the cliff. Slinging on  his pack again, he slid over the edge and down the rope.    The island was already passing. The end of the rope trailed through the  grass. He slithered down and cut a piece off his line.    It was barely long enough after he had tied a noose in the end. He  looked around at the hippogriffs. They had shied away when he dropped  onto the island, but now they stood still, watching him warily.    Johnny started to take an apple out of his pack, then changed his mind  and took a piece of honeycomb. He broke off one corner and tossed it  toward them. They fluttered their wings and backed off a few steps, then  stood still again.    Johnny sat down to wait. They were mostly chestnuts and blacks, and some  had white stockings. One was piebald. That was the one which, after a  while, began edging closer to where the honeycomb had fallen. Johnny sat  very still.           *       *       *       *       *    The piebald sniffed at the honeycomb, then jerked up its head to watch  him suspiciously. He didn't move. After a moment it took the honeycomb.    When he threw another bit, the piebald hippogriff wheeled away, but  returned almost at once and ate it. Johnny tossed a third piece only a  few yards from where he was sitting.    It was bigger than the others, and the hippogriff had to bite it in two.  When the hippogriff bent its head to take the rest Johnny was on his  feet instantly, swinging his lariat. He dropped the noose over the  hippogriff's head. For a moment the animal was too startled to do  anything; then Johnny was on its back, clinging tight.    The piebald hippogriff leaped into the air, and Johnny clamped his legs  about convulsed muscles. Pinions whipped against his knees and wind  blasted his eyes. The world tilted; they were rushing downward. His  knees pressed the sockets of the enormous wings.    The distant ramparts of the world swung madly, and he seemed to fall  upward, away from the sun that suddenly glared under the hippogriff's  talons. He forced his knees under the roots of the beating wings and dug  heels into prickling hair. A sob caught his breath and he clenched his  teeth.    The universe righted itself about him for a moment and he pulled breath  into his lungs. Then they plunged again. Wind searched under his shirt.  Once he looked down. After that he kept his eyes on the flutter of the  feather-mane.           *       *       *       *       *    A jolt sent him sliding backward. He clutched the rope with slippery  fingers. The wings missed a beat and the hippogriff shook its head as  the rope momentarily checked its breath. It tried to fly straight up,  lost way, and fell stiff-winged. The long muscles stretched under him as  it arched its back, then bunched when it kicked straight out behind. The  violence loosened his knees and he trembled with fatigue, but he wound  the rope around his wrists and pressed his forehead against whitened  knuckles. Another kick, and another. Johnny dragged at the rope.    The tense wings flailed, caught air, and brought the hippogriff upright  again. The rope slackened and he heard huge gasps. Sunlight was hot on  him again and a drop of sweat crawled down his temple. It tickled. He  loosened one hand to dab at the annoyance. A new twist sent him sliding  and he grabbed the rope. The tickle continued until he nearly screamed.  He no longer dared let go. Another tickle developed beside the first. He  scrubbed his face against the coarse fibre of the rope; the relief was  like a world conquered.    Then they glided in a steady spiral that carried them upward with  scarcely a feather's motion. When the next plunge came Johnny was ready  for it and leaned back until the hippogriff arched its neck, trying to  free itself from the pressure on its windpipe. Half choked, it glided  again, and Johnny gave it breath.    They landed on one of the little islands. The hippogriff drooped its  head and wings, trembling.    He took another piece of honeycomb from his pack and tossed it to the  ground where the hippogriff could reach it easily. While it ate he  stroked it and talked to it. When he dismounted the hippogriff took  honeycomb from his hand. He stroked its neck, breathing the sweet warm  feathery smell, and laughed aloud when it snuffled the back of his neck.    Tying the rope into a sort of hackamore, he mounted again and rode the  hippogriff to the pool below the thunder and cold spray of the  waterfall. He took care that it did not drink too much. When he ate some  apples for his lunch, the hippogriff ate the cores.    Afterward he rode to one of the drifting islands and let his mount  graze. For a while he kept by its side, making much of it. With his  fingers, he combed out the soft flowing plumes of its mane, and examined  its hoofs and the sickle-like talons of the forelegs. He saw how the  smooth feathers on its forequarters became finer and finer until he  could scarcely see where the hair on the hindquarters began. Delicate  feathers covered its head.    The island glided further and further away from the cliffs, and he  watched the waterfall dwindle away to a streak and disappear. After a  while he fell asleep.           *       *       *       *       *    He woke with a start, suddenly cold: the setting sun was below his  island. The feathery odor was still on his hands. He looked around for  the hippogriff and saw it sniffing at his pack.    When it saw him move, it trotted up to him with an expectant air. He  threw his arms about the great flat-muscled neck and pressed his face  against the warm feathers, with a faint sense of embarrassment at  feeling tears in his eyes.    \"Good old Patch,\" he said, and got his pack. He shared the last piece of  honeycomb with his hippogriff and watched the sun sink still further.  The clouds were turning red.    \"Let's go see those clouds,\" Johnny said. He mounted the piebald  hippogriff and they flew off, up through the golden air to the sunset  clouds. There they stopped and Johnny dismounted on the highest cloud of  all, stood there as it turned slowly gray, and looked into dimming  depths. When he turned to look at the world, he saw only a"]]]
