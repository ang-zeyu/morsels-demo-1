It is doubtless true that a cynical attitude of suspicion and  doubt is often exhibited on the recital of a fishing exploit. I  believe the joke editors of magazines and newspapers are responsible  for the spread of the propaganda of ridicule, skepticism and distrust  of all fish yarns, regardless of their source. The same fellows have  a day of reckoning ahead, for the circulation of that ancient but  still overworked mother-in-law joke.    It is quite possible that some amateur fishermen, wishing to pose as  experts, are guilty of expanding the size or number of their catch,  upon reporting the same. But I cannot conceive of a motive sufficient  to induce one skilled in handling the rod to lie about his fish. The  truth always sounds better and in the case of a fish story, truth is  often stranger than any fish fiction.    In my own experience and observation I have found that the more  improbable a fish story sounds the more likely it is to be true. The  incredulous attitude of the average auditor, also, is discouraging,  and often reacts against himself, as thus some of the very best fish  stories are never told. To me, it seems a pity that through these  Huns of history many charming and instructive tales of adventure  should be lost to literature and to the unoffending part of the  public.    The fellows whose exploits are here set down, seldom mention their  fishing experiences. They are not boastful, and never exaggerate.  They do not speak our language. I have, therefore, undertaken to tell  their fish stories for them.      H. A.        Fish Stories  by  Henry Abbott    BIGE had the oars and was gently and without a splash dipping them  into the water, while the boat slowly glided along parallel to the  shore of the lake. We had been up around the big island and were  crossing the bay at the mouth of Bald Mountain Brook, which is the  outlet of the pond of that name, located in a bowl shaped pocket on  the shoulder of Bald Mountain three miles away. I was in the stern  seat of the boat with a rod and was casting toward the shore, hoping  to lure the wily bass from his hiding place under rocky ledge or lily  pad, when I discovered another and a rival fisherman.      [Illustration: The Osprey]    He was operating with an aeroplane directly over our heads and about  two hundred feet above the lake. Slowly sailing in circles, with an  occasional lazy flap of wings to maintain his altitude, and at  intervals uttering his sharp, piercing, hunting cry, the osprey had a  distinct advantage over us, as with his telescopic eye he could  penetrate the lake to its bottom and could distinctly see everything  animate and inanimate in the water within his hunting circle. He  could thus, accurately, locate his prey, while we could not see  deeply into the water and were always guessing. We might make a  hundred casts in as many places, where no bass had been for hours. So  I reeled in my line, laid the rod down in the boat and gave my entire  attention to watching the operations of the fish hawk.    For about ten minutes the aeroplane fisher continued to rotate  overhead; then I observed that the circles were smaller in diameter,  and were descending in corkscrew curves, until from a height of about  fifty feet the body of the bird shot straight down and struck the  water about twenty-five yards from our boat with the blow of a spile  driver's hammer, throwing a fountain of spray high into the air. For  a few seconds nothing was visible but troubled waters; then appeared  flapping wings and the floundering shining body of a big fish,  lashing the water into a foam, through which it was difficult to see  whether bird or fish was on top. Suddenly, both disappeared under  water. Bige excitedly yelled, \"He's got his hooks into a whale of a  fish! He'll never let go! He'll be drowned! Gosh!!\" Then he rowed the  boat nearer to the place of battle. A few heart beats later, and the  fight was again on the surface. Wings flapped mightily, fish wriggled  and twisted and again the water was churned into foam. We now plainly  saw the two pairs of ice-tongs-talons of the bird, firmly clamped on  the body of the pickerel, which exceeded in length (from head to  tail) about six inches, the spread of wings from tip to tip. Wings  continued to pound air and water but the big fish could not be lifted  above the surface. One more desperate pull on the pickerel's  fin-shaped oars and the bird went under water for the third time, but  with his wicked claws as firmly clamped into the quivering body as  ever. Coming to the surface more quickly the next time, the osprey  swung his head far back, and with his ugly hook shaped beak struck  the fish a mighty blow on the back of the head. The pickerel  shivered, stiffened, and lay still.    The fight was over, but the panting hawk still hung on to his victim.    Recovering his breath in a few minutes, the bird spread his wings and  with much flapping, laboriously towed the dead fish along on the  water across the lake, where he dragged it up on a sand beach. Here  he sat for a long time, resting. Then with his hooked beak he carved  up that pickerel for his strenuously acquired meal. I have many times  seen hawks catch fish, but on all other occasions they have been able  to pick up the struggling fish and fly away with it. This fellow  hooked onto a fish so big he could not lift it.        FOUR miles up the river and about five miles eastward over Bear  Mountain, brought Bige and me to \"Hotel Palmer\" on the shore of  Sargent Pond. One room and bath were available and we took both, the  latter in the pond.    We had just enough time to finish supper before dark. The dishes had  to be washed by lantern light. In the middle of the night we heard a  \"Porky\" crawling over the roof, dragging his heavy spine covered tail  over the boards. It sounded like the scraping of a stiff wire scratch  brush. We heard him sniff and knew that he was seeking the food in  our pack basket, which his sensitive nose told him was somewhere  near. We hoped he would become discouraged and go away, but he  continued his explorations over our heads a long time, interfering  with our efforts to sleep; so a lantern was lighted and we went out  and threw sticks of wood and stones at him.    The porcupine came down that roof in the same manner that he comes  down a tree trunk, tail first, but the roof boards were steep and  slippery and his toe nails would not stick as they do in the rough  bark of a tree, so he came down hurriedly, landing with a thud on a  rotten log at the back of the cabin. In the morning we discovered  that a lot of porcupine quills were sticking vertically in the log so  that a section of it resembled an inverted scrubbing brush.      [Illustration: Hotel Palmer]    Hotel Palmer was built several years ago, by George, Dave and Leslie.  When the law respecting camps on State lands became effective, it was  torn down. But on the occasion of the porcupine incident, it was open  for the reception of guests by permission.    After breakfast, we found Dave's boat hidden in the bushes in the  specified place. During the day we hunted and got several partridges  which we proposed to roast later. That evening after supper, while  Bige was cutting some firewood, I took the boat and my rod and went  out on the pond to get some trout for breakfast.    It was just as the sun was dropping below the western hills, and  there was a gorgeous golden glow in the sky. The breeze had dropped  to a gentle zephyr that hardly caused a ripple on the surface of the  water, so I allowed the boat to slowly drift while I was casting. A  tree had fallen into the pond, and sitting in its branches near the  tree top, close to the water and about fifty feet from the shore, I  discovered a coon. He, also, was fishing, and I was curious to learn  just how he operated.    I soon found that the coon was not without curiosity since he, just  as eagerly, was watching my operations. As the boat slowly approached  the treetop his sharp, beady eyes followed the movement of my flies  as the rod whipped back and forth. It occurred to me that he might be  seriously considering the advisability of adopting a fly rod for use  in his fishing business.      [Illustration: The Coon]    Just as the boat passed the treetop and but a few feet from it, a  good sized trout appeared at the surface and with a swirl and slap of  his tail grabbed one of my flies and made off with it toward the  bottom. Instantly the coon became very excited. His body appeared  tense; his ring-banded tail swished from side to side; his feet  nervously stepped up and down on the tree branch, like a crouching  cat who sees a mouse approaching, and his snapping eyes followed the  movement of my line as it sawed through the water while the fish  rushed about, up and down, under the boat and back again. And when  the trout made a jump above the surface and shook himself, the coon  seemed to fairly dance with joy. Presently, the fish, now completely  exhausted, appeared at the surface lying on his side, while I was  reeling in the line; when the coon slipped into the water, grabbed  the fish in his mouth and swam ashore. Climbing up the bank he  turned, grinned at me and went into the bushes with my trout, now his  trout, in his mouth and about three feet of leader trailing behind.        BILL stood four feet three inches in his stockings, and if Bill had  ever been on a scale, he would have tipped it at seven pounds and six  ounces. Bill's body was about the size of a white leghorn hen. He was  mostly legs and neck.    Abe Lincoln once expressed the opinion that \"a man's legs should be  long enough to reach the ground.\" Bill was a wader by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],[0,"Such Is Life (#1)"],[1,"CHAPTER I     UNEMPLOYED    CHAPTER II    Tuesday, Oct. 9--GOOLUMBULLA; TO RORY'S    CHAPTER III   Friday, Nov. 9--CHARLEY'S PADDOCK; BINNEY; CATASTROPHE    CHAPTER IV    Sunday, Dec. 9--DEAD MAN'S BEND!

According to one theory of the Universe, the momentum of Original Impress  has been tending toward this far-off, divine event ever since a scrap  of fire-mist flew from the solar centre to form our planet.  Not this event alone, of course; but every occurrence, past and present,  from the fall of captured Troy to the fall of a captured insect.  According to another theory, I hold an independent diploma  as one of the architects of our Social System, with a commission  to use my own judgment, and take my own risks, like any other unit of humanity.  This theory, unlike the first, entails frequent hitches and cross-purposes;  and to some malign operation of these I should owe my present holiday.    Orthodoxly, we are reduced to one assumption:  namely, that my indomitable  old Adversary has suddenly called to mind Dr. Watts's friendly hint  respecting the easy enlistment of idle hands.    Good.  If either of the two first hypotheses be correct,  my enforced furlough tacitly conveys the responsibility of extending  a ray of information, however narrow and feeble, across the path  of such fellow-pilgrims as have led lives more sedentary than  my own--particularly as I have enough money to frank myself in a frugal way  for some weeks, as well as to purchase the few requisites of authorship.    If, on the other hand, my supposed safeguard of drudgery has been cut off  at the meter by that amusingly short-sighted old Conspirator,  it will be only fair to notify him that his age and experience,  even his captivating habits and well-known hospitality, will be treated  with scorn, rather than respect, in the paragraphs which he virtually forces me  to write; and he is hereby invited to view his own feather on the fatal dart.    Whilst a peculiar defect--which I scarcely like to call an oversight  in mental construction--shuts me out from the flowery pathway of the romancer,  a co-ordinate requital endows me, I trust, with the more sterling,  if less ornamental qualities of the chronicler.  This fairly equitable  compensation embraces, I have been told, three distinct attributes:  an intuition which reads men like sign-boards; a limpid veracity;  and a memory which habitually stereotypes all impressions except those  relating to personal injuries.    Submitting, then, to the constitutional interdict already glanced at,  and availing myself of the implied license to utilise that homely talent  of which I am the bailee, I purpose taking certain entries from my diary,  and amplifying these to the minutest detail of occurrence or conversation.  This will afford to the observant reader a fair picture of Life,  as that engaging problem has presented itself to me.    Twenty-two consecutive editions of Lett's Pocket Diary,  with one week in each opening, lie on the table before me; all filled up,  and in a decent state of preservation.  I think I shall undertake  the annotation of a week's record.  A man might, if he were of a fearful heart,  stagger in this attempt; but I shut my eyes, and take up one  of the little volumes.  It proves to be the edition of 1883.  Again I shut my eyes while I open the book at random.  It is the week  beginning with Sunday, the 9th of September.    SUN. SEPT.  9.  Thomp.  Coop.  &c.  10-Mile Pines.  Cleo.  Duff.  Selec.    The fore part of the day was altogether devoid of interest or event.  Overhead, the sun blazing wastefully and thanklessly through  a rarefied atmosphere; underfoot the hot, black clay, thirsting  for spring rain, and bare except for inedible roley-poleys, coarse tussocks,  and the woody stubble of close-eaten salt-bush; between sky and earth,  a solitary wayfarer, wisely lapt in philosophic torpor.  Ten yards behind the grey saddle-horse follows a black pack-horse,  lightly loaded; and three yards behind the pack-horse ambles listlessly  a tall, slate-coloured kangaroo dog, furnished with the usual  poison muzzle--a light wire basket, worn after the manner of a nose-bag.    Mile after mile we go at a good walk, till the dark boundary  of the scrub country disappears northward in the glassy haze, and in front,  southward, the level black-soil plains of Riverina Proper mark  a straight sky-line, broken here and there by a monumental clump or pine-ridge.  And away beyond the horizon, southward still, the geodesic curve carries  that monotony across the zone of salt-bush, myall, and swamp box;  across the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee, and on to the Victorian border--say,  two hundred and fifty miles.    Just about mid-day, the station track I was following intersected  and joined the stock route; and against the background of a pine-ridge,  a mile ahead, I saw some wool-teams.  When I overtook them,  they had stopped for dinner among the trees.  One of the party was  an intimate friend of mine, and three others were acquaintances;  so, without any of the ceremony which prevails in more refined circles,  I hooked Fancy's rein on a pine branch, pulled the pack-saddle off Bunyip,  and sat down with the rest, to screen the tea through my teeth  and flick the diligent little operatives out of the cold mutton  with the point of my pocket-knife.    There were five bullock-teams altogether:  Thompson's twenty;  Cooper's eighteen; Dixon's eighteen; and Price's two teams of fourteen each.  Three of the wagons, in accordance with a fashion of the day,  bore names painted along the board inside the guard irons.  Thompson's was  the Wanderer; Cooper's, the Hawkesbury; and Dixon's, the Wombat.  All were platform wagons, except Cooper's, which was the Sydney-side pattern.    To avoid the vulgarity of ushering this company into the presence  of the punctilious reader without even the ceremony of a Bedouin  introduction--(This is my friend, N or M; if he steals anything,  I will be responsible for it):  a form of introduction, by the way,  too sweeping in its suretyship for prudent men to use in Riverina--I shall  describe the group, severally, with such succinctness as may be compatible  with my somewhat discursive style.    Steve Thompson was a Victorian.  He was scarcely a typical bullock driver,  since fifteen years of that occupation had not brutalised his temper,  nor ensanguined his vocabulary, nor frayed the terminal \"g\"  from his participles.  I knew him well, for we had been partners in dogflesh  and colleagues in larceny when we were, as poets feign, nearer to heaven  than in maturer life.  And, wide as Riverina is, we often encountered  fortuitously, and were always glad to fraternise.  Physically,  Thompson was tall and lazy, as bullock drivers ought to be.    Cooper was an entire stranger to me, but as he stoutly contended  that Hay and Deniliquin were in Port Phillip, I inferred him to be a citizen  of the mother colony.  Four months before, he had happened to strike  the very first consignment of goods delivered at Nyngan by rail,  for the Western country.  He had chanced seven tons of this, for Kenilworth;  had there met Thompson, delivering salt from Hay; and now the two,  freighted with Kenilworth wool, were making the trip to Hay together.  Kenilworth was on the commercial divide, having a choice of two evils--the  long, uninviting track southward to the Murrumbidgee, and the  badly watered route eastward to the Bogan.  This was Cooper's first experience  of Riverina, and he swore in no apprentice style that it would be his last.  A correlative proof of the honest fellow's Eastern extraction lay  in the fact that he was three inches taller, three stone heavier,  and thirty degrees lazier, than Thompson.    I had known Dixon for many years.  He was a magnificent specimen  of crude humanity; strong, lithe, graceful, and not too big--just such a man  as your novelist would picture as the nurse-swapped offspring  of some rotund or ricketty aristocrat.  But being, for my own part,  as I plainly stated at the outset, incapable of such romancing,  I must register Dixon as one whose ignoble blood had crept through scoundrels  since the Flood.  Though, when you come to look at it leisurely,  this wouldn't interfere with aristocratic, or even regal, descent--rather  the reverse.    Old Price had carted goods from Melbourne to Bendigo in '52; a hundred miles,  for £100 per ton.  He had had two teams at that time, and,  being a man of prudence and sagacity, had two teams still,  and was able to pay his way.  I had known him since I was about the height  of this table; he was Old Price then; he is Old Price still;  and he will probably be Old Price when my head is dredged with the white flour  of a blameless life, and I am pottering about with a stick,  hating young fellows, and making myself generally disagreeable.  Price's second team was driven by his son Mosey, a tight little fellow,  whose body was about five-and-twenty, but whose head, according to  the ancient adage, had worn out many a good pair of shoulders.    Willoughby, who was travelling loose with Thompson and Cooper, was a whaler.  Not owing to any inherent incapacity, for he had taken his B.A.  at an English university, and was, notwithstanding his rags and dirt,  a remarkably fine-looking man; bearing a striking resemblance to Dixon,  even in features.
