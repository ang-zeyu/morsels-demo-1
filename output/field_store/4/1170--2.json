COPYRIGHTED, 1903,    BY THE    HAND PRINT BOOK FOLK, BOSTON, MASS.      ALL THE ILLUSTRATIONS HERE SHOWN, INCLUDING THE TITLE PAGE, ARE  REPRODUCED FROM PEN DRAWINGS MADE EXPRESSLY FOR THIS BOOK, AT GREAT  EXPENSE, AND ALL PERSONS ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED NOT TO REPRODUCE THEM  WITHOUT PERMISSION          PUBLISHER'S PREFACE    [Illustration]      Whatever other merit may be discovered in this book, the publishers  desire to call attention to the fact that, as a whole, it is a  production altogether unique in a field of endeavor where something new  is being constantly sought, but seldom found.    The poem is entirely hand-printed in large and legible letters,  designedly kept free from ornate fancies and, therefore, particularly  easy to read. The hand-printing accords with the adjoining illustrations  as angular and machine-made type never does, giving a pleasing and  harmonious effect to the entire page, a result not to be obtained by the  ordinary art of the printer.    Attention is also called to the illustrations of the volume. Their  merely mechanical arrangement upon the page is in itself unusual, we  might almost say unknown to the reading public, while the imaginative  story that the artist has told in the illustrations that he has  contributed, is not only of the real and material world, but also of  powers behind the scenes, which offer the motives and even supply the  cues of most, if not all of the actors, who perform upon the great stage  of life. In this, too, the book is unusual, if not unique, and offers a  fertile field to the imagination of a discerning public in connection  with the delicious humor of the poem itself.    While, therefore, fully conscious of how far short the volume falls from  what might be done in the direction in which it only points the way, the  publishers offer it as one of a series now in preparation, of similar  works which, it is believed, will be found worthy of more than a few  moments of the amused attention of the reader.    THE HAND PRINT BOOK FOLK.    _Back Bay, Boston, Mass., October, 1903._    [Illustration]          Artist's Announcement    [Illustration]      If the reader will pardon an unconventional obtrusion upon his attention  for a brief moment, he may be interested to follow somewhat the train of  thought in the artist's mind prior to his beginning to illustrate this  book.    When \"The Story of an Ostrich\" was put into his hands, his first  impression was, \"Here is a merely juvenile theme, to be treated with  light, conventional and ornamental drawings, as an adornment to a fairy  tale.\"    As he read it, he gradually perceived a deeper significance concealed  beneath the laugh that must inevitably be aroused at the thought of the  ridiculous figure of the foolish ostrich pecking away at his homely  feet, under the delusion that they are not his own.    The longer he studied and pondered over it, the more was he impressed  with the conviction that underneath the simple phraseology of the poem,  the author had conveyed a lesson that humanity might well pause and  heed.... In these days of \"making many books,\" how welcome should be that  one whose story aims to raise the burden that weighs down the surcharged  heart, or seeks to still the fever coursing through the blood of men and  women struggling with the complicated problems of life!    \"The Story of an Ostrich\" is so simple in its form that children may  read it with pleasure and profit, thereby drawing the simpler moral  from the tale; while there is also suggested a possible condition of  society that shall be attuned to the perfect chord of divine law,  through the subordination of individualism in such manner as to produce  complete harmony in all human affairs.    In the pride and dominance of the head over the rest of the body, in its  scorn of the feet, equally indispensable with the head to the welfare of  the whole, the poem has struck at the discordant note of all our human  disaffection and rebellion.    When the artist had thus searched and found between the lines the real  motive of the poem, it at once became pregnant with allusions and  references that suggested artistic elaboration, or pen analysis, of the  large area of social life, which the allegory, in its semi-humorous,  satirical vein, assumes to cover.    If his pencil seems at times to wander far afield, either in elaboration  or disregard of the canon principles of art, his plea must be that the  interpretation he has given is according to his carefully studied  conception of what the author must have had in mind when writing \"The  Story of an Ostrich.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration]      _Thou sluggard in bonds to a vision of night,    Be not a king's fool, but a proud man of might:    Arise like a lord, that ye may not be slain,    No door shall imprison, no hope be in vain;    The world is for conquest, who seeks for such goal,    Will find the chain riven, the key in his soul!_          _The unknown spake out of the firmament, saying,--\"Choose ye one  instrument first, and then attune another one to it. This accomplished,  attune then a third instrument to them; after that a fourth, and so on;  and ye shall be all attuned alike.\"_    _Thereupon, the musicians set to work, but could not agree as to whose  should be the first instrument._    _A pillar of fire descended from Heaven and stood in the midst of the  musicians; and in the centre of the pillar of fire there appeared an  instrument called the All Perfect. The instrument gave forth one note  and all the musicians attuned to it. The Voice said, \"I have given the  keynote, find ye the rest!\"_    _The pillar of fire departed. The instruments thus attuned in harmony  played rapturously._    _This I perceive,--to make the man and wife one, to make the village  one, to make the state one, to make the empire one,--all in harmony as  one instrument, cannot be done without a Central Son, a Creator to  attune to. When a man is attuned to Him, and a woman is attuned to Him,  they will themselves be as one. When the family and the village are  attuned to Him, it is easy. Without Him harmony cannot be._    _He, the Creator, then, must be first in all things, first in all  places. He must be the nearest of all things, the nearest of all places.  In our rites and ceremonies, He must be the All Ideal Perfection, the  embodiment of a Perfect Person._--Book of Saphah.            The Story of an Ostrich      [Illustration]      BY    JUDD ISAACS,        FORMERLY EDITOR OF THE YANKEE BLADE,        NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE, NICKELL MAGAZINE.          [Illustration]    The Story of an Ostrich.          A robust old ostrich, with head little bigger      Than that of some creatures of far frailer figure,      With two legs complete, and a speed very fleet,      Once caught a short peep at his feet, in the street.        So far from his head did they seem to be located,      He failed to take note that upon each were notated      Scales, warts and abrasions, nails, ossification,      Which proved them a part of his own corporation.        He noticed, however, wherever he went,      They came along, too, and he asked what it meant?      Though he walked through the town, or he stalked o'er the heath      He observed they remained, always, right underneath.      He thrust out his bust and inside he just cussed,      When they strode along and kept kicking up dust;      But in vain did he feign to abstain from disdain,      As he dined with the twain in the wind and the rain;    _Copyrighted by the Hand Print Book Folk, Boston, Mass._    [Illustration]        Or stared around therein, while wearing a bear-grin,      Evincing an evident, ill-concealed chagrin.        So very ungainly were they, like a tumor,      The ostrich, at last, got in very bad humor;      And, failing to recognise them as his own,      Made a peck with his beak that went clear to the bone,      Which gave all his nerves such a terrible thrill,      He quick pecked another hard peck with his bill;      With each peck a quiver, his frame shook with shivers,      As if his limp liver were pierced with slim slivers,--      Till both his great feet with his heart's blood were red,      Oozing out on the ground, as he'd painfully tread.        It was strange that his feet, thus, he blindly maltreated,      Debased his escheat and his comfort defeated!      As a matter of fact, he never had noticed      How he'd got around; and he'd not the remotest      Idea that his own high position depended      On two ugly feet that his good taste offended.          The Undertone    [Illustration]      _I._    The thoughtful student of modern, social, and economic conditions, who  reads the accompanying rhymed satire, \"The Story of an Ostrich,\" will  discover in it much more than the mere words would ordinarily convey,  and will read into it such measure of philosophy as his own experience  and critical study of the problem of human existence may have prepared  him for.    When, ten thousand years ago, the owl sat in the light of the moon and  unknown deities spat wisdom into the philosophies of Hermes and  Zoroaster and their more or less erudite predecessors, the earliest  gods, with their bird-like heads and male bodies, were yet vehicles of  truth, elevating the frail stock of humanity over which they threw their  benign influences.    Since recorded history began, the world has had many gods, and many  books concerning them have been written, determining by much labor of  the head which should be worshiped, rather than impressing the heart  with sincere desire to travel in divinely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3754"],[0,"The Wonders of Instinct: Chapters in the Psychology of Insects (#1)"],[1,"by Al Haines.

THE GREAT CAPRICORN: THE MALE AND THE FEMALE.      EXPERIMENTS.    EXPERIMENT 1. The mole is fixed fore and aft, with a lashing of raphia,  to a light horizontal cross-bar resting on two forks. The Necrophori,  after long tiring themselves in digging under the body, end by severing  the bonds.    EXPERIMENT 2. A dead mouse is placed on the branches of a tuft of  thyme. By dint of jerking, shaking and tugging at the body, the  Burying-beetles succeed in extricating it from the twigs and bringing  it down.    EXPERIMENT 3. With a ligament of raphia, the Mole is fixed by the hind  feet to a twig planted vertically in the soil. The head and shoulders  touch the ground. By digging under these, the Necrophori at the same  time uproot the gibbet, which eventually falls, dragged over by the  weight of its burden.    EXPERIMENT 4. The stake is slanting; the Mole touches the ground, but  at a point two inches from the base of the gibbet. The Burying-beetles  begin by digging to no purpose under the body. They make no attempt to  overturn the stake. In this experiment they obtain the Mole at last by  employing the usual method, that is by gnawing the bond.

This is what I wished for, hoc erat in votis: a bit of land, oh, not so  very large, but fenced in, to avoid the drawbacks of a public way; an  abandoned, barren, sun-scorched bit of land, favoured by thistles and  by Wasps and Bees. Here, without fear of being troubled by the  passers-by, I could consult the Ammophila and the Sphex (two species of  Digger-or Hunting-wasps.--Translator's Note.) and engage in that  difficult conversation whose questions and answers have experiment for  their language; here, without distant expeditions that take up my time,  without tiring rambles that strain my nerves, I could contrive my plans  of attack, lay my ambushes and watch their effects at every hour of the  day. Hoc erat in votis. Yes, this was my wish, my dream, always  cherished, always vanishing into the mists of the future.    And it is no easy matter to acquire a laboratory in the open fields,  when harassed by a terrible anxiety about one's daily bread. For forty  years have I fought, with steadfast courage, against the paltry plagues  of life; and the long-wished-for laboratory has come at last. What it  has cost me in perseverance and relentless work I will not try to say.  It has come; and, with it--a more serious condition--perhaps a little  leisure. I say perhaps, for my leg is still hampered with a few links  of the convict's chain.    The wish is realized. It is a little late, O! my pretty insects! I  greatly fear that the peach is offered to me when I am beginning to  have no teeth wherewith to eat it. Yes, it is a little late: the wide  horizons of the outset have shrunk into a low and stifling canopy, more  and more straitened day by day. Regretting nothing in the past, save  those whom I have lost; regretting nothing, not even my first youth;  hoping nothing either, I have reached the point at which, worn out by  the experience of things, we ask ourselves if life be worth the living.    Amid the ruins that surround me, one strip of wall remains standing,  immovable upon its solid base: my passion for scientific truth. Is that  enough, O! my busy insects, to enable me to add yet a few seemly pages  to your history? Will my strength not cheat my good intentions? Why,  indeed, did I forsake you so long?    Friends have reproached me for it. Ah, tell them, tell those friends,  who are yours as well as mine, tell them that it was not forgetfulness  on my part, not weariness, nor neglect: I thought of you; I was  convinced that the Cerceris' (A species of Digger-wasp.--Translator's  Note.) cave had more fair secrets to reveal to us, that the chase of  the Sphex held fresh surprises in store. But time failed me; I was  alone, deserted, struggling against misfortune. Before philosophizing,  one had to live. Tell them that, and they will pardon me.    Others have reproached me with my style, which has not the solemnity,  nay, better, the dryness of the schools. They fear lest a page that is  read without fatigue should not always be the expression of the truth.  Were I to take their word for it, we are profound only on condition of  being obscure. Come here, one and all of you--you, the sting-bearers,  and you, the wing-cased armour-clads--take up my defence and bear  witness in my favour. Tell of the intimate terms on which I live with  you, of the patience with which I observe you, of the care with which I  record your actions. Your evidence is unanimous: yes, my pages, though  they bristle not with hollow formulas nor learned smatterings, are the  exact narrative of facts observed, neither more nor less; and whoso  cares to question you in his turn will obtain the same replies.    And then, my dear insects, if you cannot convince those good people,  because you do not carry the weight of tedium, I, in my turn, will say  to them:    \"You rip up the animal and I study it alive; you turn it into an object  of horror and pity, whereas I cause it to be loved; you labour in a  torture-chamber and dissecting-room, I make my observations under the  blue sky, to the song of the Cicadae (The Cicada Cigale, an insect akin  to the Grasshopper and found more particularly in the south of  France.--Translator's Note.); you subject cell and protoplasm to  chemical tests, I study instinct in its loftiest manifestations; you  pry into death, I pry into life. And why should I not complete my  thought: the boars have muddied the clear stream; natural history,  youth's glorious study, has, by dint of cellular improvements, become a  hateful and repulsive thing. Well, if I write for men of learning, for  philosophers, who, one day, will try to some extent to unravel the  tough problem of instinct, I write also, I write above all things, for  the young, I want to make them love the natural history which you make  them hate; and that is why, while keeping strictly to the domain of  truth, I avoid your scientific prose, which too often, alas, seems  borrowed from some Iroquois idiom!\"    But this is not my business for the moment: I want to speak of the bit  of land long cherished in my plans to form a laboratory of living  entomology, the bit of land which I have at last obtained in the  solitude of a little village. It is a \"harmas,\" the name given, in this  district (The country round Serignan, in Provence.--Translator's  Note.), to an untilled, pebbly expanse abandoned to the vegetation of  the thyme. It is too poor to repay the work of the plough; but the  Sheep passes there in spring, when it has chanced to rain and a little  grass shoots up.    My harmas, however, because of its modicum of red earth swamped by a  huge mass of stones, has received a rough first attempt at cultivation:  I am told that vines once grew here. And, in fact, when we dig the  ground before planting a few trees, we turn up, here and there, remains  of the precious stock, half carbonized by time. The three-pronged fork,  therefore, the only implement of husbandry that can penetrate such a  soil as this, has entered here; and I am sorry, for the primitive  vegetation has disappeared. No more thyme, no more lavender, no more  clumps of kermes-oak, the dwarf oak that forms forests across which we  step by lengthening our stride a little. As these plants, especially  the first two, might be of use to me by offering the Bees and Wasps a  spoil to forage, I am compelled to reinstate them in the ground whence  they were driven by the fork.    What abounds without my mediation is the invaders of any soil that is  first dug up and then left for a time to its own"]]]
