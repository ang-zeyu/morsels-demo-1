No  571 of the Munich Library. The MS. of Mr. Gayangos appears to be  part of a larger book, since its second leaf is numbered 111 (the  corner of the first is worn off), and the last is numbered 170, and  ends with the description of the Lequeos. The _Epitome de la  Biblioteca Oriental, Occidental, Nautica y Geografica_ of D. Antonio  de Leon Pinelo, Madrid, 1737, mentions, at p. 667 a work of  Magellan's under the following heading: _Fernando de Magallanes,  Efemerides, or Diary of his Navigation_, a MS. which existed in the  possession of Antonio Moreno, Cosmographer of the House of Trade,  according to Don Nicolas Antonio.

The Spanish manuscript from which this volume has been translated is  in the handwriting of the beginning of 1500, full of abbreviations,  and without punctuation or capital letters at the beginnings of  sentences or for the proper names, which adds much to the difficulty  of reading it. It contains eighty-seven leaves. The handwriting more  resembles an example of the year 1510 than those dated 1529 and  1531, given at p. 319 of the \"Escuela de Leer Letras Cursivas  Antiguas y Modernas desde la entrada de los Godos en Espana, por el  P. Andres Merino de Jesu Christo, Madrid, 1780.\" This work was  translated into Spanish from the original Portuguese in 1524, at  Vittoria, by Martin Centurion, ambassador of the community of Genoa,  with the assistance of Diego Ribero, a Portuguese, cosmographer and  hydrographer to his Majesty Charles V. There are reasons (as will be  shewn in the notes) for supposing that the Spanish translation,  probably this copy and not the Portuguese original, assisted the  compilers of the early atlases, especially that of Abraham Ortelius,  of Antwerp, 1570, other editions of which were published in  succeeding years.[1] The similarity of the orthography of this  manuscript and of that of the names in maps as late as that of  Homann, Nuremberg, 1753, shews how much geography up to a recent  period was indebted to the Portuguese and Spaniards. It may also be  observed that from their familiarity at that time with the sounds of  Arabic, the proper names are in general more correctly rendered in  European letters, than used to be the case in later times.    This MS. is in the Barcelona Library and is there catalogued \"Viage  por Malabar y costas de Africa, 1512: letra del siglo xvi.\" It was  supposed to be an original Spanish work, for the statement of its  having been translated is in the body of the MS., no part of which  can be read without more or less difficulty. This work is not a book  of travels as the title given in the catalogue, though not on the  MS., indicates; it is rather an itinerary, or description of  countries. It gives ample details of the trade, supplies, and water  of the various seaports mentioned in it. It contains many  interesting historical details, some of which, such as the account  of Diu, the taking of Ormuz, the founding of the Portuguese fort in  Calicut, their interruption of the Indian trade to Suez by capturing  the Indian ships, the rise of Shah Ismail, etc., fix pretty nearly  the exact date at which this narrative was composed as the year  1514.    Two other MS. copies of this work are preserved in the Royal Library  at Munich: the first of these, No. 570 of the catalogue of that  library, is in a handwriting very similar to that of the Barcelona  MS., and apparently of the same period. It consists of one hundred  and three leaves, and is stated to have proceeded from the episcopal  library of Passau. This MS. does not contain the appendix respecting  the prices of the precious stones. The other MS. No. 571, is of  fifty-three leaves, and is written in two handwritings, both of  which are much rounder and clearer than that of No. 570; the  catalogue states that this MS. came from the library of the Jesuits  of Augsburg. There are several verbal differences between the two  MSS., and perhaps No. 571 agrees more exactly with the Barcelona MS.  The two Munich MSS. frequently write words such as rey with a double  r, as _rrey_, which does not occur in the Barcelona MS., where,  however, words begin with a large r, which is also used for a double  r in the middle of a word.    The piracies of the Portuguese are told without any reticence,  apparently without consciousness of their criminality, for no  attempt is made to justify them, and the pretext that such and such  an independent state or city did not choose to submit itself on  being summoned to do so by the Portuguese, seems to have been  thought all sufficient for laying waste and destroying it. This  narrative shows that most of the towns on the coasts of Africa,  Arabia, and Persia were in a much more flourishing condition at that  time than they have been since the Portuguese ravaged some of them,  and interfered with the trade of all. The description of the early  introduction of the cultivation and weaving of cotton into South  Africa by the Arab traders will be read with interest; and the  progress then beginning in those regions three hundred and fifty  years ago, and the subsequent stand still to which it has been  brought by the Portuguese and by the slave-trade to America, may be  taken as supporting the views lately put forward by Captain R.  Burton and others at the Anthropological Society.    The greater part of this volume was printed in Italian by Ramusio in  1554 in his collection of travels (Venetia, nella Stamperia de'  Giunti), as the narration of Duarte Barbosa, and a large part of  this work must have been written by Barbosa; and a Portuguese  manuscript of his was printed at Lisbon in 1812 in the \"Colleccao de  noticias para a historia e geografia das nacoes ultramarinas.\" This  manuscript of Barbosa's, however, is much less full than this  Spanish MS. of Barcelona, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#1)"],[1,"AMONG THE CHICKENS      BY    P.

It sounds so weak-minded. But in the case of Love  Among the Chickens it is unavoidable. It was not so much that you  sympathised and encouraged--where you really came out strong was that  you gave me the stuff. I like people who sympathise with me. I am  grateful to those who encourage me. But the man to whom I raise the  Wodehouse hat--owing to the increased cost of living, the same old  brown one I had last year--it is being complained of on all sides, but  the public must bear it like men till the straw hat season comes  round--I say, the man to whom I raise this venerable relic is the man  who gives me the material.    Sixteen years ago, my William, when we were young and spritely lads;  when you were a tricky centre-forward and I a fast bowler; when your  head was covered with hair and my list of \"Hobbies\" in Who's Who  included Boxing; I received from you one morning about thirty  closely-written foolscap pages, giving me the details of your friend  -----'s adventures on his Devonshire chicken farm. Round these I wove  as funny a plot as I could, but the book stands or falls by the stuff  you gave me about \"Ukridge\"--the things that actually happened.    You will notice that I have practically re-written the book. There was  some pretty bad work in it, and it had \"dated.\" As an instance of the  way in which the march of modern civilisation has left the 1906 edition  behind, I may mention that on page twenty-one I was able to make  Ukridge speak of selling eggs at six for fivepence!

Mr. Ukridge.\"    \"Oh, my sainted aunt!\"    \"Sir!\"    \"Nothing, nothing.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Mrs. Medley, withdrawing from the presence.    Ukridge! Oh, hang it! I had not met him for years, and, glad as I am,  as a general thing, to see the friends of my youth when they drop in  for a chat, I doubted whether I was quite equal to Ukridge at the  moment. A stout fellow in both the physical and moral sense of the  words, he was a trifle too jumpy for a man of my cloistered and  intellectual life, especially as just now I was trying to plan out a  new novel, a tricky job demanding complete quiet and seclusion. It had  always been my experience that, when Ukridge was around, things began  to happen swiftly and violently, rendering meditation impossible.  Ukridge was the sort of man who asks you out to dinner, borrows the  money from you to pay the bill, and winds up the evening by embroiling  you in a fight with a cabman. I have gone to Covent Garden balls with  Ukridge, and found myself legging it down Henrietta Street in the grey  dawn, pursued by infuriated costermongers.    I wondered how he had got my address, and on that problem light was  immediately cast by Mrs. Medley, who returned, bearing an envelope.    \"It came by the morning post, sir, but it was left at Number Twenty by  mistake.\"    \"Oh, thank you.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Mrs. Medley.    I recognised the handwriting. The letter, which bore a Devonshire  postmark, was from an artist friend of mine, one Lickford, who was at  present on a sketching tour in the west. I had seen him off at Waterloo  a week before, and I remember that I had walked away from the station  wishing that I could summon up the energy to pack and get off to the  country somewhere. I hate London in July.    The letter was a long one, but it was the postscript which interested  me most.      \"... By the way, at Yeovil I ran into an old friend of ours, Stanley  Featherstonehaugh Ukridge, of all people. As large as life--quite six  foot two, and tremendously filled out. I thought he was abroad. The  last I heard of him was that he had started for Buenos Ayres in a  cattle ship, with a borrowed pipe by way of luggage. It seems he has  been in England for some time. I met him in the refreshment-room at  Yeovil Station. I was waiting for a down train; he had changed on his  way to town. As I opened the door, I heard a huge voice entreating the  lady behind the bar to 'put it in a pewter'; and there was S. F. U. in  a villainous old suit of grey flannels (I'll swear it was the one he  had on last time I saw him) with pince-nez tacked on to his ears with  ginger-beer wire as usual, and a couple of inches of bare neck showing  between the bottom of his collar and the top of his coat--you remember  how he could never get a stud to do its work. He also wore a  mackintosh, though it was a blazing day.    \"He greeted me with effusive shouts. Wouldn't hear of my standing the  racket. Insisted on being host. When we had finished, he fumbled in his  pockets, looked pained and surprised, and drew me aside. 'Look here,  Licky, old horse,' he said, 'you know I never borrow money. It's  against my principles. But I _must_ have a couple of bob. Can you, my  dear good fellow, oblige me with a couple of bob till next Tuesday?  I'll tell you what I'll do. (In a voice full of emotion). I'll let you  have this (producing a beastly little threepenny bit with a hole in it  which he had probably picked up in the street) until I can pay you  back. This is of more value to me than I can well express, Licky, my  boy. A very, very dear friend gave it to me when we parted, years  ago... It's a wrench... Still,--no, no... You must take it, you must  take it. Licky, old man, shake hands, old horse. Shake hands, my boy.'  He then tottered to the bar, deeply moved, and paid up out of the five  shillings which he had made it as an after-thought. He asked after you,  and said you were one of the noblest men on earth. I gave him your  address, not being able to get out of it, but if I were you I should  fly while there is yet time.\"      It seemed to me that the advice was good and should be followed. I  needed a change of air. London may have suited Doctor Johnson, but in  the summer time it is not for the ordinary man. What I wanted, to  enable me to give the public of my best (as the reviewer of a weekly  paper, dealing with my last work, had expressed a polite hope that I  would continue to do) was a little haven in the country somewhere.    I rang the bell.    \"Sir?\" said Mrs. Medley.    \"I'm going away for a bit,\" I said.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I don't know where. I'll send you the address, so that you can forward  letters.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And, if Mr. Ukridge calls again...\"    At this point a thunderous knocking on the front door interrupted me.  Something seemed to tell me who was at the end of that knocker. I heard  Mrs. Medley's footsteps pass along the hall. There was the click of the  latch. A volume of sound rushed up the stairs.    \"Is Mr. Garnet in? Where is he? Show me the old horse. Where is the man  of wrath? Exhibit the son of Belial.\"    There followed a violent crashing on the stairs, shaking the house.    \"Garnet! Where are you, laddie? Garnet!! GARNET!!!!!\"    Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge was in my midst.        CHAPTER II    MR. AND MRS. S. F. UKRIDGE    I have often thought that Who's Who, though a bulky and well-meaning  volume, omits too many of England's greatest men. It is not  comprehensive enough. I am in it, nestling among the G's:--    \"Garnet, Jeremy, o.s. of late Henry Garnet, vicar of Much Middlefold,  Salop; author. Publications: 'The Outsider,' 'The Manoeuvres of  Arthur.' Hobbies: Cricket, football, swimming, golf. Clubs: Arts.\"    But if you search among the U's for UKRIDGE, Stanley Featherstonehaugh,  details of whose tempestuous career would make really interesting  reading, you find no mention of him. It seems unfair, though I imagine  Ukridge bears it with fortitude. That much-enduring man has had a  lifetime's training in bearing things with fortitude.    He seemed in his customary jovial spirits now, as he dashed into the  room, clinging on to the pince-nez which even ginger-beer wire rarely  kept stable for two minutes together.    \"My dear old man,\" he shouted, springing at me and seizing my hand in  the grip like the bite of a horse. \"How _are_ you, old buck? This is  good. By Jove, this is fine, what?\"    He dashed to the door and looked out.    \"Come on Millie! Pick up the waukeesis. Here's old Garnet, looking just  the same as ever. Devilish handsome fellow! You'll be glad you came  when you see him. Beats the Zoo hollow!\"    There"]]]
