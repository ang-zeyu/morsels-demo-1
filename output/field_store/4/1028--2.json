[TR: Date stamp: JUN 26 1937]          MEMORIES OF UNCLE JACKSON      \"I was born in 1851, in the yard where my owner lived next door to the  City Hall. I remember when they was finishin' up the City Hall. I also  remember the foreman, Mr. James Walker, he was general manager. The  overseen (overseer) was Mr. Keen. I remember all the bricklayers; they  all was colored. The man that plastered the City Hall was named George  Price, he plastered it inside. The men that plastered the City Hall  outside and put those colum's up in the front, their names was Robert  Finey and William Finey, they both was colored. Jim Artis now was a  contractor an' builder. He done a lot of work 'round Wilmin'ton.    \"Yes'm, they was slaves, mos' all the fine work 'round Wilmin'ton was  done by slaves. They called 'em artisans. None of 'em could read, but  give 'em any plan an' they could foller it to the las' line.\"    Interviewer: \"Did the owner collect the pay for the labor, Uncle  Jackson?\"    \"No, ma'm. That they did'n. We had a lot of them artisans 'mongst our  folks. They all lived on our place with they fam'lies. They hired  theyselves where they pleased. They colle'ted they pay, an' the onliest  thing the owner took was enough to support they fam'lies. They all  lived in our yard, it was a great big place, an' they wimmen cooked  for 'em and raised the chilluns.    \"You know, they lays a heap o' stress on edication these days. But  edication is one thing an' fireside trainin' is another. We had  fireside trainin'.    \"We went to church regular. All our people marched behind our owners,  an' sat up in the galle'y of the white folks church. Now, them that  went to St. James Church behind their white folks didn' dare look at  nobody else. 'Twant allowed. They were taught they were better than  anybody else. That was called the 'silk stockin' church. Nobody else  was fitten to look at.    \"My mother was the laund'ess for the white folks. In those days ladies  wore clo'es, an' plenty of 'em. My daddy was one of the part Indian  folks. My mammy was brought here from Washin'ton City, an' when her  owner went back home he sold her to my folks. You know, round  Washin'ton an' up that way they was Ginny (Guinea) niggers, an' that's  what my mammy was. We had a lot of these malatto negroes round here,  they was called 'Shuffer Tonies', they was free issues and part Indian.  The leader of 'em was James Sampson. We child'en was told to play in  our own yard and not have nothin' to do with free issue chil'en or the  common chil'en 'cross the street, white or colored, because they was'nt  fitten to 'sociate with us. You see our owners was rich folks. Our big  house is the one where the ladies of Sokosis (Sorosis) has their Club  House, an' our yard spread all round there, an' our house servants, an'  some of the bes' artisans in Wilmin'ton lived in our yard.    \"You know, I'm not tellin' you things what have been _told_ me, but I'm  tellin' you things I _knows_.    \"I remember when the Zoabbes company came from Georgia here to  Wilmin'ton an' they had all ladies as officers.[1]    \"I remember when the Confederates captured part of the Union Army at  Fort Sumter, S.C., and they brought them here to Wilmin'ton and put  them out under Fourth Street bridge, and the white ladies of  Wilmin'ton, N.C. cooked food and carried it by baskets full to them. We  all had plenty of food. A warehouse full of everything down there by  the river nigh Red Cross Street, an' none of us ever went hungry 'till  the war was over.    \"I remember when Gen'ral Grant's Army came to the river. They mounted  guns to boombar the city. Mr. John Dawson an' Mr. Silas Martin, they  went on the corner of Second an' Nun Streets on the top of Ben Berry's  house an' run up a white sheet for a flag, an' the Yankees did'n'  boombar us. An' Mr. Martin gave his house up to the Progro Marshells,  and my mother cleaned up the house an' washed for them. Her name was  Caroline West.    \"I remember when that Provo Marshell told the colored people that any  house in Wilmin'ton they liked, that was empty, they could go take it,  an' the first one they took was the fine Bellamy Mansion on Market an'  Fifth Street.\"    \"Uncle Jackson\", asked the interviewer, \"don't you remember that house  was headquarters of the Federal Army? How could colored people occupy  it?\"    Uncle Jackson: \"I don't remember nothin' about Federal soldiers bein'  in that house, but I'm tellin' you I _knows_ a lot of common"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31221"],[0,"The Genera of Phyllomedusine Frogs (Anura: Hylidae) (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net            UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY      Volume 18, No. 1, pp. 1-10 September 24, 1968          The Genera of Phyllomedusine Frogs (Anura: Hylidae)    BY    WILLIAM E.

(BOB) SANDERS, STATE PRINTER TOPEKA, KANSAS 1968    32-3687          The Genera of Phyllomedusine Frogs (Anura: Hylidae)    BY    WILLIAM E. DUELLMAN      One of the most distinctive phyletic lines among the diverse Neotropical  hylid frogs is composed of a group of 40 species placed in the genus  _Phyllomedusa_ (Funkhouser, 1957) or in two or three different genera  (Goin, 1961; Lutz, 1966). These species differ from all other  Neotropical hylids by possessing a vertical, instead of horizontal,  pupil. The only other hylids having a vertical pupil belong to the  Papuan genus _Nyctimystes_. Goin (1961) erroneously stated that  _Nyctimantis_ and _Triprion_ have vertical pupils.    Although limited information is available on the cytotaxonomy of hylids,  the data show that phyllomedusine species have _n_=13 (2_n_=26)  chromosomes. _Acris_ has _n_=11 (2_n_=22) (Cole, 1966). Members of the  _Hyla leucophyllata_, _microcephala_, and _parviceps_ groups have _n_=15  (2_n_=30), _Gastrotheca ceratophrys_ has a haploid number of 14, the  Papuan hylid genus _Nyctimystes_ and all but one of the Australo-Papuan  _Hyla_ for which the numbers are known have a haploid number of 13, and  all other New World hylids studied have _n_=12 (2_n_=24) (Duellman and  Cole, 1965; Duellman, 1967).    Cei (1963) and Cei and Erspamer (1966) noted that phyllomedusine frogs  differ notably from other Neotropical hylids on the basis of the amines  and polypeptides in the skin. All species of phyllomedusines deposit  their eggs in a gelatinous mass on leaves or branches above water.  Although this type of egg deposition is characteristic of some  rhacophorines and apparently all centrolenids, it is known among hylids  only in the phyllomedusines and in two species of _Hyla_.    The distinctive combination of morphological, physiological,  chromosomal, and behavioral characteristics is strongly suggestive that  these frogs represent an early phyletic divergence within the Hylidae.  Guenther (1859) proposed the familial name Phyllomedusidae for  _Phyllomedusa bicolor_ (Boddaert). I suggest the recognition of the  group as a subfamily. The following classification of the  phyllomedusines is based on my own knowledge of the Middle American and  some South American species and on evidence from the literature on those  South American species with which I am not personally familiar.      Subfamily Phyllomedusinae Guenther, 1859         Phyllomedusidae Guenther 1859 [Type genus, _Phyllomedusa_ Wagler,       1830].    _Definition._--Moderately small to large hylids having vertical pupils,  _n_=13 (2_n_=26) chromosomes, skin containing large amounts of  powerful bradykinin-like and physalaemin-like polypeptides, eggs  suspended from vegetation above water, and tadpoles have a ventral  spiracle sinistral to midline.    _Range._--Low and moderate elevations in South and Middle America,  including Trinidad, from northern Argentina and northwestern Ecuador to  Veracruz and southern Sonora, Mexico.    _Content._--Three genera, one of which probably is composite.      Genus =Agalychnis= Cope, 1864.    _Agalychnis_ Cope, 1864 [Type species, _Hyla moreletii_ Dumeril, 1853,  by subsequent designation].    _Definition._--Fingers and toes at least half webbed; terminal discs  large; first toe shorter than second and not opposable to others; skin  smooth, lacking osteoderms; parotoid glands, if present, poorly  developed and diffuse; palpebral membrane reticulate (except in _A.  calcarifer_); iris red or yellow; skull shallow, depth less than 40 per  cent of length; nasals large; frontoparietal fontanelle large;  quadratojugals reduced; prevomerine teeth present.    _Range._--Central Veracruz and northern Oaxaca, Mexico, southeastward  through Central America to northwestern Ecuador; one species disjunct in  Amazonian Ecuador.    _Content._--Eight species [synonyms in brackets]: _annae_ (Duellman,  1963); _calcarifer_ Boulenger, 1902; _callidryas_ (Cope, 1862)  [_helenae_ Cope, 1885; _callidryas taylori_ (Funkhouser, 1957)];  _craspedopus_ (Funkhouser, 1957); _litodryas_ (Duellman and Trueb,  1967); _moreleti_ (Dumeril, 1853) [_holochroa_ (Salvin, 1861)];  _saltator_ Taylor, 1955; _spurrelli_ Boulenger, 1913.    _Remarks._--Savage and Heyer (1967) provided evidence that _A.  callidryas taylori_ (Funkhouser) and _A. helenae_ Cope were junior  synonyms of _A. callidryas_ (Cope).      Genus =Pachymedusa=, new genus    Type species, _Agalychnis dacnicolor_ Cope, 1864.    _Definition._--Fingers and toes having basal webs and lateral fringes;  terminal discs large; first toe shorter than second and not opposable to  others; skin smooth or shagreened, lacking osteoderms; paratoid glands  present, diffuse; palpebral membrane reticulate; iris golden yellow with  black reticulations; skull deep, depth more than 50 per cent of length;  nasals large; frontoparietal fontanelle moderately large; quadratojugal  robust; prevomerine teeth present.    _Range._--Pacific slopes and lowlands from southern Sonora to the  Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico.    _Content._--Monotypic: _dacnicolor_ Cope, 1864 [_alcorni_ Taylor, 1952].    _Remarks._--The generic name is derived from the Greek _pachy_ meaning  thick and the Greek _Medousa_ (Latin, _Medusa_) in reference to  _Phyllomedusa_; the sense implied is the heavy body of _Pachymedusa  dacnicolor_.      Genus =Phyllomedusa= Wagler, 1830    _Phyllomedusa_ Wagler, 1830 [Type species, _Rana bicolor_ Boddaert,  1772].    _Pithecopus_ Cope, 1866 [Type species, _Phyllomedusa azurea_ Cope, 1862  (=_Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis_ Daudin, 1803), by original  designation].    _Hylomantis_ Peters, 1872 [Type species _Hylomantis aspera_ Peters,  1872, by monotypy].    _Phrynomedusa_ Miranda-Ribeiro, 1923 [Type species, _Phrynomedusa  fimbriata_ Miranda-Ribeiro, 1923, by subsequent designation].    _Bradymedusa_ Miranda-Ribeiro, 1926 [Type species, _Bradymedusa  moschada_ Miranda-Ribeiro, 1926 (=_Phyllomedusa rohdei_ Mertens, 1926)  by subsequent designation].    _Definition._--Fingers and toes having greatly reduced webbing or  lacking webs; terminal discs small; first toe shorter than, equal to, or  longer than second, opposable or not; skin smooth or rugose having  osteoderms or not; parotoid glands present, in most species, usually  distinct and elevated; palpebral membrane not reticulate; iris uniformly  silvery white to orange-bronze with black reticulations; skull moderate  to deep, depth more than 38 per cent of length; nasals moderately small;  frontoparietal fontanelle present, variable in size; quadratojugal  reduced in some species; prevomerine teeth present or absent.    _Range._--Low and moderate elevations in South America east of the Andes  from the Caribbean (including Trinidad) to northern Argentina; Costa  Rica and Panama in Central America.    _Content._--Thirty-one species [synonyms in brackets]: _aspera_ (Peters,  1872); _ayeaye_ (B. Lutz, 1966); _bahiana_ A. Lutz, 1925; _bicolor_  (Boddaert, 1772) [_scleroderma_ Cope, 1868]; _blombergi_ Funkhouser,  1957; _boliviana_ Boulenger, 1902; _buckleyi_ Boulenger, 1882;  _burmeisteri burmeisteri_ Boulenger, 1882; _burmeisteri distincta_ B.  Lutz, 1950; _centralis_ Bokermann, 1965; _cochranae_ Bokermann, 1966;  _coelestis_ (Cope, 1874); _edentula_ Andersson, 1945; _feltoni_ Shreve,  1935; _fimbriata_ (Miranda-Ribeiro, 1923) [_appendiculata_ A. Lutz,  1925]; _guttata_ A. Lutz, 1925; _hypochondrialis_ (Daudin, 1803)  [_azurea_ Cope, 1862; _megacephala_ (Miranda-Ribeiro, 1926)]; _iheringi_  Boulenger, 1885; _lemur_ Boulenger, 1882; _loris_ Boulenger, 1912;  _medinae_ Funkhouser, 1962; _nicefori_ Barbour, 1926; _orcesi_  Funkhouser, 1957; _pailona_ Shreve, 1959; _perlata_ Boulenger, 1882;  _rohdei_ Mertens, 1926 [_moschada_ (Miranda-Ribeiro, 1926)]; _sauvagei_  Boulenger, 1882 [_rickettsii_ Guenther, 1897]; _tarsius_ (Cope, 1868);  _tomopterna_ (Cope, 1868) [_palliata_ Peters, 1872]; _trinitatis_  Mertens, 1926, _vaillanti_ Boulenger, 1882, _venusta_ Duellmann and  Trueb, 1967.    _Remarks._--_Phyllomedusa_ includes 1) a series of large species  (_bicolor-burmeisteri_) showing progressive specialization of the feet;  2) a series of small species having grasping feet (_ayeaye_,  _centralis_, _cochranae_, _guttata_, _hypochondrialis_, and _rohdei_);  3) a series of small, relatively unspecialized species (_lemur_,  _loris_, and _medinae_); and 4) several other species of questionable  affinities. Lutz (1966) resurrected Cope's (1866) _Pithecopus_ for 12  species (_ayeaye_, _boliviana_, _burmeisteri_, _coelestis_,  _hypochondrialis_, _nicefori_, _rohdei_, _sauvagei_, _tarsius_,  _tomopterna_, _trinitatis_, and _vaillanti_). Adequate material is not  available for detailed study of all South American species;  consequently, a firm classification cannot be established at this time.  Nevertheless, it is obvious that Lutz's arrangement is unnatural. If  subsequent investigations show, as seems likely, that the small  specialized phyllomedusines are a natural phyletic unit, the generic  name _Pithecopus_ is available. However, species such as _boliviana_,  _burmeisteri_, _nicefori_, and _trinitatis_ do not belong in  _Pithecopus_. As noted by Funkhouser (1962), the small, relatively  unspecialized species (_lemur_, _loris_, and _medinae_) form a natural  group; possibly this group should be accorded"]]]
