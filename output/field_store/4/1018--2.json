But, Lord,  you can fix 'em up if you want to. Did you ever hear about Henery, that  used to drive for old John Bull--about Henery and the elephant?\"    Alfred was chauffeur to a friend of mine who owned a very powerful car.  Alfred was part of that car. Weirdly intelligent, of poor physique, he  might have been any age from fifteen to eighty. His education had been  somewhat hurried, but there was no doubt as to his mechanical ability.  He took to a car like a young duck to water. He talked motor, thought  motor, and would have accepted--I won't say with enthusiasm, for  Alfred's motto was 'Nil admirari'--but without hesitation, an offer to  drive in the greatest race in the world. He could drive really well,  too; as for belief in himself, after six months' apprenticeship in  a garage he was prepared to vivisect a six-cylinder engine with the  confidence of a diplomaed bachelor of engineering.    Barring a tendency to flash driving, and a delight in persecuting slow  cars by driving just in front of them and letting them come up and enjoy  his dust, and then shooting away again, he was a respectable member of  society. When his boss was in the car he cloaked the natural ferocity of  his instincts; but this day, with only myself on board, and a clear run  of a hundred and twenty miles up to the station before him, he let her  loose, confident that if any trouble occurred I would be held morally  responsible.    As we flew past a somnolent bush pub, Alfred, whistling softly, leant  forward and turned on a little more oil.    \"You never heard about Henery and the elephant?\" he said. \"It was dead  funny. Henery was a bushwacker, but clean mad on motorin'. He was wood  and water joey at some squatter's place until he seen a motor-car go  past one day, the first that ever they had in the districk.    \"'That's my game,' says Henery; 'no more wood and water joey for me.'    \"So he comes to town and gets a job off Miles that had that garage at  the back of Allison's. An old cove that they called John Bull--I don't  know his right name, he was a fat old cove--he used to come there to  hire cars, and Henery used to drive him. And this old John Bull he  had lots of stuff, so at last he reckons he's going to get a car for  himself, and he promises Henery a job to drive it. A queer cove this  Henery was--half mad, I think, but the best hand with a car ever I see.\"    While he had been talking we topped a hill, and opened up a new stretch  of blue-grey granite-like road. Down at the foot of the hill was a  teamster's waggon in camp; the horses in their harness munching at their  nose-bags, while the teamster and a mate were boiling a billy a little  off to the side of the road. There was a turn in the road just below  the waggon which looked a bit sharp, so of course Alfred bore down on it  like a whirlwind. The big stupid team-horses huddled together and pushed  each other awkwardly as we passed. A dog that had been sleeping in  the shade of the waggon sprang out right in front of the car, and was  exterminated without ever knowing what struck him.    There was just room to clear the tail of the waggon and negotiate the  turn. Alfred, with the calm decision of a Napoleon, swung round the bend  to find that the teamster's hack, fast asleep, was tied to the tail of  the waggon. Nothing but a lightning-like twist of the steering-wheel  prevented our scooping the old animal up, and taking him on board as a  passenger. As it was, we carried off most of his tail as a trophy on the  brass of the lamp. The old steed, thus rudely awakened, lashed out good  and hard, but by that time we were gone, and he missed the car by a  quarter of a mile.    During this strenuous episode Alfred never relaxed his professional  stolidity, and, when we were clear, went on with his story in the tone  of a man who found life wanting in animation.    \"Well, at fust, the old man would only buy one of these little  eight-horse rubby-dubbys that go strugglin' up 'ills with a death-rattle  in its throat, and all the people in buggies passin' it. O' course that  didn't suit Henery. He used to get that spiked when a car passed him,  he'd nearly go mad. And one day he nearly got the sack for dodgin' about  up a steep 'ill in front of one o' them big twenty-four Darracqs, full  of 'owlin' toffs, and not lettin' 'em get a chance to go past till they  got to the top. But at last he persuaded old John Bull to let him go  to England and buy a car for him. He was to do a year in the shops, and  pick up all the wrinkles, and get a car for the old man. Bit better than  wood and water joeying, wasn't it?\"    Our progress here was barred by our rounding a corner right on to a  flock of sheep, that at once packed together into a solid mass in front  of us, blocking the whole road from fence to fence.    \"Silly cows o' things, ain't they?\" said Alfred, putting on his  emergency brake, and skidding up till the car came softly to rest  against the cushion-like mass--a much quicker stop than any horse-drawn  vehicle could have made. A few sheep were crushed somewhat, but it  is well known that a sheep is practically indestructible by violence.  Whatever Alfred's faults were, he certainly could drive.    \"Well,\" he went on, lighting a cigarette, unheeding the growls of the  drovers, who were trying to get the sheep to pass the car, \"well, as I  was sayin', Henery went to England, and he got a car. Do you know wot he  got?\"    \"No, I don't.\"    \"'E got a ninety,\" said Alfred slowly, giving time for the words to soak  in.    \"A ninety! What do you mean?\"    \"'E got a ninety--a ninety-horse-power racin' engine wot was made  for some American millionaire and wasn't as fast as wot some other  millionaire had, so he sold it for the price of the iron, and Henery got  it, and had a body built for it, and he comes out here and tells us all  it's a twenty mongrel--you know, one of them cars that's made part in  one place and part in another, the body here and the engine there, and  the radiator another place. There's lots of cheap cars made like that.    \"So Henery he says that this is a twenty mongrel--only a four-cylinder  engine; and nobody drops to what she is till Henery goes out one Sunday  and waits for the big Napier that Scotty used to drive--it belonged to  the same bloke wot owned that big racehorse wot won all the races. So  Henery and Scotty they have a fair go round the park while both their  bosses is at church, and Henery beat him out o' sight--fair lost  him--and so Henery was reckoned the boss of the road. No one would take  him on after that.\"    A nasty creek-crossing here required Alfred's attention. A little girl,  carrying a billy-can of water, stood by the stepping stones, and smiled  shyly as we passed. Alfred waved her a salute quite as though he were an  ordinary human being. I felt comforted. He had his moments of relaxation  evidently, and his affections like other people.    \"What happened to Henry and the ninety-horse machine?\" I asked. \"And  where does the elephant come in?\"    Alfred smiled pityingly.    \"Ain't I tellin' yer,\" he said. \"You wouldn't understand if I didn't  tell yer how he got the car and all that. So here's Henery,\" he went on,  \"with old John Bull goin' about in the fastest car in Australia, and  old John, he's a quiet old geezer, that wouldn't drive faster than the  regulations for anything, and that short-sighted he can't see to  the side of the road. So what does Henery do? He fixes up the  speed-indicator--puts a new face on it, so that when the car is doing  thirty, the indicator only shows fifteen, and twenty for forty, and so  on. So out they'd go, and if Henery knew there was a big car in front of  him, he'd let out to forty-five, and the pace would very near blow  the whiskers off old John; and every now and again he'd look at the  indicator, and it'd be showin' twenty-two and a half, and he'd say:    \"'Better be careful, Henery, you're slightly exceedin' the speed limit;  twenty miles an hour, you know, Henery, should be fast enough for  anybody, and you're doing over twenty-two.'    \"Well, one day, Henery told me, he was tryin' to catch up a big car that  just came out from France, and it had a half-hour start of him, and he  was just fairly flyin', and there was a lot of cars on the road, and he  flies past 'em so fast the old man says, 'It's very strange, Henery,'  he says, 'that all the cars that are out to-day are comin' this way,' he  says. You see he was passin' 'em so fast he thought they were all comin'  towards him.    \"And Henery sees a mate of his comin', so he lets out a notch or two,  and the two cars flew by each other like chain lightnin'. They were each  doin' about forty, and the old man, he says, 'There's a driver must be  travellin' a hundred miles an hour,' he says. 'I never see a car go by  so fast in my life,' he says. 'If I could find out who he is, I'd report  him,' he says. 'Did you know the car, Henery?' But of course Henery, he  doesn't know, so on they goes.    \"The owner of the big"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

TURNER.]      Library Edition    The Complete Works of John Ruskin    STONES OF VENICE    VOLUMES I-II                National Library Association  New York             Chicago          THE  STONES OF VENICE    VOLUME I.    THE FOUNDATIONS          PREFACE.      In the course of arranging the following essay, I put many things aside  in my thoughts to be said in the Preface, things which I shall now put  aside altogether, and pass by; for when a book has been advertised a  year and a half, it seems best to present it with as little preface as  possible.    Thus much, however, it is necessary for the reader to know, that, when I  planned the work, I had materials by me, collected at different times of  sojourn in Venice during the last seventeen years, which it seemed to me  might be arranged with little difficulty, and which I believe to be of  value as illustrating the history of Southern Gothic. Requiring,  however, some clearer assurance respecting certain points of chronology,  I went to Venice finally in the autumn of 1849, not doubting but that  the dates of the principal edifices of the ancient city were either  ascertained, or ascertainable without extraordinary research. To my  consternation, I found that the Venetian antiquaries were not agreed  within a century as to the date of the building of the facades of the  Ducal Palace, and that nothing was known of any other civil edifice of  the early city, except that at some time or other it had been fitted up  for somebody's reception, and been thereupon fresh painted. Every date  in question was determinable only by internal evidence, and it became  necessary for me to examine not only every one of the older palaces,  stone by stone, but every fragment throughout the city which afforded  any clue to the formation of its styles. This I did as well as I could,  and I believe there will be found, in the following pages, the only  existing account of the details of early Venetian architecture on which  dependence can be placed, as far as it goes. I do not care to point out  the deficiencies of other works on this subject; the reader will find,  if he examines them, either that the buildings to which I shall  specially direct his attention have been hitherto undescribed, or else  that there are great discrepancies between previous descriptions and  mine: for which discrepancies I may be permitted to give this single and  sufficient reason, that my account of every building is based on  personal examination and measurement of it, and that my taking the pains  so to examine what I had to describe, was a subject of grave surprise to  my Italian friends. The work of the Marchese Selvatico is, however, to  be distinguished with respect; it is clear in arrangement, and full of  useful, though vague, information; and I have found cause to adopt, in  great measure, its views of the chronological succession of the edifices  of Venice. I shall have cause hereafter to quarrel with it on other  grounds, but not without expression of gratitude for the assistance it  has given me. Fontana's \"Fabbriche di Venezia\" is also historically  valuable, but does not attempt to give architectural detail. Cicognara,  as is now generally known, is so inaccurate as hardly to deserve  mention.    Indeed, it is not easy to be accurate in an account of anything, however  simple. Zoologists often disagree in their descriptions of the curve of  a shell, or the plumage of a bird, though they may lay their specimen on  the table, and examine it at their leisure; how much greater becomes the  likelihood of error in the description of things which must be in many  parts observed from a distance, or under unfavorable circumstances of  light and shade; and of which many of the distinctive features have been  worn away by time. I believe few people have any idea of the cost of  truth in these things; of the expenditure of time necessary to make sure  of the simplest facts, and of the strange way in which separate  observations will sometimes falsify each other, incapable of  reconcilement, owing to some imperceptible inadvertency. I am ashamed of  the number of times in which I have had to say, in the following pages,  \"I am not sure,\" and I claim for them no authority, as if they were  thoroughly sifted from error, even in what they more confidently state.  Only, as far as my time, and strength, and mind served me, I have  endeavored down to the smallest matters, to ascertain and speak the  truth.    Nor was the subject without many and most discouraging difficulties,  peculiar to itself. As far as my inquiries have extended, there is not a  building in Venice, raised prior to the sixteenth century, which has not  sustained essential change in one or more of its most important  features. By far the greater number present examples of three or four  different styles, it may be successive, it may be accidentally  associated; and, in many instances, the restorations or additions have  gradually replaced the entire structure of the ancient fabric, of which  nothing but the name remains, together with a kind of identity,  exhibited in the anomalous association of the modernized portions: the  Will of the old building asserted through them all, stubbornly, though  vainly, expressive; superseded by codicils, and falsified by  misinterpretation; yet animating what would otherwise be a mere group of  fantastic masque, as embarrassing to the antiquary, as to the  mineralogist, the epigene crystal, formed by materials of one substance  modelled on the perished crystals of another. The church of St. Mark's  itself, harmonious as its structure may at first sight appear, is an  epitome of the changes of Venetian architecture from the tenth to the  nineteenth century. Its crypt, and the line of low arches which support  the screen, are apparently the earliest portions; the lower stories of  the main fabric are of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, with later  Gothic interpolations; the pinnacles are of the earliest fully developed  Venetian Gothic (fourteenth century); but one of them, that on the  projection at the eastern extremity of the Piazzetta de Leoni, is of far  finer, and probably earlier workmanship than all the rest. The southern  range of pinnacles is again inferior to the northern and western, and  visibly of later date. Then the screen, which most writers have  described as part of the original fabric, bears its date inscribed on  its architrave, 1394, and with it are associated a multitude of small  screens, balustrades, decorations of the interior building, and probably  the rose window of the south transept. Then come the interpolated  traceries of the front and sides; then the crocketings of the upper  arches, extravagances of the incipient Renaissance: and, finally, the  figures which carry the waterspouts on the north side--utterly barbarous  seventeenth or eighteenth century work--connect the whole with the  plastered restorations of the year 1844 and 1845. Most of the palaces in  Venice have sustained interpolations hardly less numerous; and those of  the Ducal Palace are so intricate, that a year's labor would probably be  insufficient altogether to disentangle and define them. I therefore gave  up all thoughts of obtaining a perfectly clear chronological view of the  early architecture; but the dates necessary to the main purposes of the  book the reader will find well established; and of the evidence brought  forward for those of less importance, he is himself to judge. Doubtful  estimates are never made grounds of argument; and the accuracy of the  account of the buildings themselves, for which alone I pledge myself,  is of course entirely independent of them.    In like manner, as the statements briefly made in the chapters on  construction involve questions so difficult and so general, that I  cannot hope that every expression referring to them will be found free  from error: and as the conclusions to which I have endeavored to lead  the reader are thrown into a form the validity of which depends on that  of each successive step, it might be argued, if fallacy or weakness  could be detected in one of them, that all the subsequent reasonings  were valueless. The reader may be assured, however, that it is not so;  the method of proof used in the following essay being only one out of  many which were in my choice, adopted because it seemed to me the  shortest and simplest, not as being the strongest. In many cases, the  conclusions are those which men of quick feeling would arrive at  instinctively; and I then sought to discover the reasons of what so  strongly recommended itself as truth. Though these reasons could every  one of them, from the beginning to the end of the book, be proved  insufficient, the truth of its conclusions would remain the same. I  should only regret that I had dishonored them by an ill-grounded  defence; and endeavor"]]]
