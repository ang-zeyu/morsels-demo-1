DECEMBER TERM, 1856.    DRED SCOTT    VERSUS    JOHN F.A. SANDFORD.           DRED SCOTT, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, _v._ JOHN F.A. SANDFORD.         This case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit       Court of the United States for the district of Missouri.         It was an action of trespass _vi et armis_ instituted in the       Circuit Court by Scott against Sandford.         Prior to the institution of the present suit, an action was       brought by Scott for his freedom in the Circuit Court of St.       Louis county, (State court,) where there was a verdict and       judgment in his favor. On a writ of error to the Supreme       Court of the State, the judgment below was reversed, and the       case remanded to the Circuit Court, where it was continued       to await the decision of the case now in question.         The declaration of Scott contained three counts: one, that       Sandford had assaulted the plaintiff; one, that he had       assaulted Harriet Scott, his wife; and one, that he had       assaulted Eliza Scott and Lizzie Scott, his children.         Sandford appeared, and filed the following plea:         DRED SCOTT         }       _v._               } _Plea to the jurisdiction of the Court._       JOHN F.A. SANFORD. }         APRIL TERM, 1854.         And the said John F.A. Sandford, in his own proper person,       comes and says, that this court ought not to have or take       further cognisance of the action aforesaid, because he says       that said cause of action, and each and every of them, (if       any such have accrued to the said Dred Scott,) accrued to       the said Dred Scott out of the jurisdiction of this court,       and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the courts of       the State of Missouri, for that, to wit: the said plaintiff,       Dred Scott, is not a citizen of the State of Missouri, as       alleged in his declaration, because he is a negro of African       descent; his ancestors were of pure African blood, and were       brought into this country and sold as negro slaves, and this       the said Sandford is ready to verify. Wherefore he prays       judgment, whether this court can or will take further       cognizance of the action aforesaid.         JOHN F.A. SANDFORD.         To this plea there was a demurrer in the usual form, which       was argued in April, 1854, when the court gave judgment that       the demurrer should be sustained.         In May, 1854, the defendant, in pursuance of an agreement       between counsel, and with the leave of the court, pleaded in       bar of the action:         1. Not guilty.         2. That the plaintiff was a negro slave, the lawful property       of the defendant, and, as such, the defendant gently laid       his hands upon him, and thereby had only restrained him, as       the defendant had a right to do.         3. That with respect to the wife and daughters of the       plaintiff, in the second and third counts of the declaration       mentioned, the defendant had, as to them, only acted in the       same manner, and in virtue of the same legal right.         In the first of these pleas, the plaintiff joined issue; and       to the second and third, filed replications alleging that       the defendant, of his own wrong and without the cause in his       second and third pleas alleged, committed the trespasses,       &c.         The counsel then filed the following agreed statement of       facts, viz:         In the year 1834, the plaintiff was a negro slave belonging       to Dr. Emerson, who was a surgeon in the army of the United       States. In that year, 1834, said Dr. Emerson took the       plaintiff from the State of Missouri to the military post at       Rock Island, in the State of Illinois, and held him there as       a slave until the month of April or May, 1836. At the time       last mentioned, said Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff from       said military post at Rock Island to the military post at       Fort Snelling, situate on the west bank of the Mississippi       river, in the Territory known as Upper Louisiana, acquired       by the United States of France, and situate north of the       latitude of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north, and       north of the State of Missouri. Said Dr. Emerson held the       plaintiff in slavery at Fort Snelling, from said last       mentioned date until the year 1838.         In the year 1835, Harriet, who is named in the second count       of the plaintiff's declaration, was the negro slave of Major       Taliaferro, who belonged to the army of the United States.       In that year, 1835, said Major Taliaferro took said Harriet       to said Fort Snelling, a military post, situated as herein       before stated, and kept her there as a slave until the year       1836, and then sold and delivered her as a slave at said       Fort Snelling unto the said Dr. Emerson herein before named.       Said Dr. Emerson held said Harriet in slavery at said Fort       Snelling until the year 1838.         In the year 1836, the plaintiff and said Harriet, at said       Fort Snelling, with the consent of said Dr. Emerson, who       then claimed to be their master and owner, intermarried, and       took each other for husband and wife. Eliza and Lizzie,       named in the third count of the plaintiff's declaration, are       the fruit of that marriage. Eliza is about fourteen years       old, and was born on board the steamboat Gipsey, north of       the north line of the State of Missouri, and upon the river       Mississippi. Lizzie is about seven years old, and was born       in the State of Missouri, at the military post called       Jefferson Barracks.         In the year 1838, said Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff and       said Harriet, and their said daughter Eliza, from said Fort       Snelling to the State of Missouri, where they have ever       since resided.         Before the commencement of this suit, said Dr. Emerson sold       and conveyed the plaintiff, said Harriet, Eliza, and Lizzie,       to the defendant, as slaves, and the defendant has ever       since claimed to hold them, and each of them, as slaves.         At the times mentioned in the plaintiff's declaration, the       defendant, claiming to be owner as aforesaid, laid his hands       upon said plaintiff, Harriet, Eliza, and Lizzie, and       imprisoned them, doing in this respect, however, no more       than what he might lawfully do, if they were of right his       slaves at such times.         Further proof may be given on the trial for either party.         It is agreed that Dred Scott brought suit for his freedom in       the Circuit Court of St. Louis county; that there was a       verdict and judgment in his favor; that on a writ of error       to the Supreme Court the judgment below was reversed, and       the same remanded to the Circuit Court, where it has been       continued to await the decision of this case.         In May, 1854, the cause went before a jury, who found the       following verdict, viz: \"As to the first issue joined in       this case, we of the jury find the defendant not guilty; and       as to the issue secondly above joined, we of the jury find       that, before and at the time when, &c., in the first count       mentioned, the said Dred Scott was a negro slave, the lawful       property of the defendant; and as to the issue thirdly above       joined, we, the jury, find that, before and at the time       when, &c., in the second and third counts mentioned, the       said Harriet, wife of said Dred Scott, and Eliza and Lizzie,       the daughters of the said Dred Scott, were negro slaves, the       lawful property of the defendant.\"         Whereupon, the court gave judgment for the defendant.         After an ineffectual motion for a new trial, the plaintiff       filed the following bill of exceptions.         On the trial of this cause by the jury, the plaintiff, to       maintain the issues on his part, read to the jury the       following agreed statement of facts, (see agreement above.)       No further testimony was given to the jury by either party.       Thereupon the plaintiff moved the court to give to the jury       the following instruction, viz:         \"That, upon the facts agreed to by the parties, they ought       to find for the plaintiff. The court refused to give such       instruction to the jury, and the plaintiff, to such refusal,       then and there duly excepted.\"         The court then gave the following instruction to the jury,       on motion of the defendant:         \"The jury are instructed, that upon the facts in this case,       the law is with the defendant.\" The plaintiff excepted to       this instruction.         Upon these exceptions, the case came up to this court.         It was argued at December term, 1855, and ordered to be       reargued at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],[0,"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#1)"],[1,"Writings                                    1883-1896                                        by                                 Mary Baker Eddy                   Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science                      and Author of Science and Health with                              Key to the Scriptures                                 Published by the                  Trustees under the Will of Mary Baker G.

MARY BAKER EDDY            PREFACE.      [Page ix.]    [Transcriber's Note: The original book includes line numbers throughout  the text, for easy reference to the text by page number and line number.  This transcription retains those page and line numbers; the numbers in  [square brackets] at the right ends of lines are the original book's line  numbers. The paragraphs are not adjusted as is customary for text in  e-books, nor are words split by hyphens rejoined, so that the lines shown  below have the same words as the lines in the original book.]    A certain apothegm of a Talmudical philosopher [1]  suits my sense of doing good. It reads thus: \"The  noblest charity is to prevent a man from accepting  charity; and the best alms are to show and to enable a  man to dispense with alms.\" [5]    In the early history of Christian Science, among my  thousands of students few were wealthy. Now, Christian  Scientists are not indigent; and their comfortable fortunes  are acquired by healing mankind morally, physically,  spiritually. The easel of time presents pictures--once [10]  fragmentary and faint--now rejuvenated by the touch  of God's right hand. Where joy, sorrow, hope, disap-  pointment, sigh, and smile commingled, now hope sits  dove-like.    To preserve a long course of years still and uniform, [15]  amid the uniform darkness of storm and cloud and  tempest, requires strength from above,--deep draughts  from the fount of divine Love. Truly may it be said:  There is an old age of the heart, and a youth that never  grows old; a Love that is a boy, and a Psyche who is [20]  ever a girl. The fleeting freshness of youth, however,  is not the evergreen of Soul; the coloring glory of    [Page x.]    perpetual bloom; the spiritual glow and grandeur of [1]  a consecrated life wherein dwelleth peace, sacred and  sincere in trial or in triumph.    The opportunity has at length offered itself for me to  comply with an oft-repeated request; namely, to collect [5]  my miscellaneous writings published in _The Christian_  _Science Journal_, since April, 1883, and republish them  in book form,--accessible as reference, and reliable as  old landmarks. Owing to the manifold demands on my  time in the early pioneer days, most of these articles [10]  were originally written in haste, without due preparation.  To those heretofore in print, a few articles are herein  appended. To some articles are affixed data, where these  are most requisite, to serve as mile-stones measuring the  distance,--or the difference between then and now,-- [15]  in the opinions of men and the progress of our Cause.    My signature has been slightly changed from my  Christian name, Mary Morse Baker. Timidity in early  years caused me, as an author, to assume various _noms_  _de plume_. After my first marriage, to Colonel Glover [20]  of Charleston, South Carolina, I dropped the name of  Morse to retain my maiden name,--thinking that other-  wise the name would be too long.    In 1894, I received from the Daughters of the American  Revolution a certificate of membership made out to Mary [25]  Baker Eddy, and thereafter adopted that form of signature,  except in connection with my published works.    [Page xi.]    The first edition of Science and Health having been [1]  copyrighted at the date of its issue, 1875, in my name  of Glover, caused me to retain the initial \"G\" on my  subsequent books.    These pages, although a reproduction of what has [5]  been written, are still in advance of their time; and are  richly rewarded by what they have hitherto achieved for  the race. While no offering can liquidate one's debt of  gratitude to God, the fervent heart and willing hand are  not unknown to nor unrewarded by Him. [10]    May this volume be to the reader a graphic guide-  book, pointing the path, dating the unseen, and enabling  him to walk the untrodden in the hitherto unexplored  fields of Science. At each recurring holiday the Christian  Scientist will find herein a \"canny\" crumb; and thus [15]  may time's pastimes become footsteps to joys eternal.    Realism will at length be found to surpass imagination,  and to suit and savor all literature. The shuttlecock of  religious intolerance will fall to the ground, if there"]]]
