While there are some excellent mink trappers, no one man has studied  out all the methods, for the conditions under which the trapper in  the South makes his largest catches would probably be of little value  to the trapper of the Far North, where snow covers the ground the  greater part of the year.    Conditions along the Atlantic are different than the Pacific, and as  well the methods used by thousands of trappers along the Mississippi  and its tributaries differ from the Eastern or Western Coast trapper,  for the mink's food is not the same along the fresh inland waters as  the coast or salt water.    The methods published are from all parts of the country, and many  experienced trappers tell of their best methods, so that it makes no  difference in what part of America you live, something will be found  of how to trap in your section. Most of the articles are taken from  those published in the H-T-T with slight correction.    A. R. HARDING.        MINK TRAPPING        CHAPTER I.    GENERAL INFORMATION.    Mink are found in nearly all parts of America living along creeks,  rivers, lakes and ponds. While strictly speaking they are not a water  animal, yet their traveling for food and otherwise is mainly near the  water, so that the trapper finds this the best place to set his  traps.    The mink is fond of fish, rabbit, squirrel, birds, mice, etc. In some  sections they eat muskrat, but we believe they prefer other animals,  only eating muskrat when very hungry and other game is scarce.    At certain seasons scent seems to attract them while at other times  the flesh of the rabbit, bird or fish will attract them. The trapper  who makes mink trapping a business should have various kinds of traps  and sets for them, such as steel traps, both bait and blind sets, as  well as deadfalls.    Mink, while small, are quite strong for their size and very active.  While a No. 0 Newhouse will hold them, the No. 1 is usually  considered the proper trap.    As already mentioned, mink travel a great deal near water, so that  the place to catch them is close to the water or in the water. If you  notice mink tracks near the water, in some narrow place where the  bank comes nearly to the water or a rock or log projects nearly to  the water, carefully dig a hole the size of your trap and an inch or  more deep, covering with a large leaf or a piece of paper first. Then  place a thin layer of earth removed over leaf or paper, making the  set look as natural as before. The dirt from the hole for trap as  taken out should be thrown in the water or to one side. One of the  great secrets in mink trapping, especially blind sets, is to leave  things as near as possible as they were before the set was made.    There are various shades of mink--some quite dark, others brown,  pale, and some cotton. The greater number, however, are brown. In the  Northeast, Maine, etc., mink are not large, but the color is rather  dark. In the same latitude some ten or twelve hundred miles west in  Minnesota and Manitoba, Canada mink are larger but not so dark. Still  further west on the coast of Washington mink are again smaller, being  somewhat similar in size to the Maine mink but much lighter in color.  Throughout the central section such as Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,  etc., they are larger than the Maine mink but smaller than Minnesota.  In color not near so dark as the Eastern or Maine mink.    The cotton mink is found principally in the prairie and level  sections. In general appearance it is much the same as a pale or  light brown mink, but on blowing into the fur the under portion is  white, hence cotton. Such skins are worth much less than the brown  and dark ones. In fact, for years cotton mink sold for 10 to 50  cents.    During the past years the value of mink skins has varied a great  deal. The number exported annually varies from a couple of hundred  thousand to a half million skins or more. This gives but a faint idea  of the annual catch, for large numbers are used each year by American  manufacturers.    There has been a great deal said about mink climbing trees, many  being under the impression that they could not or did not unless  leaning trees. This is a mistake however, as trappers have tracked  them in these now up straight and good sized trees. They will also  occasionally tree when close pressed by dogs.    Mink can be tamed if caught when young but are rather treacherous,  and should never be handled bare handed. A few attempts have been  made to raise them for their fur, but so far no great success has  been achieved. The raising of mink will no doubt be undertaken from  this on by many, especially if prices remain as of late, for when  skins sell for several dollars each the business looks promising. No  man should engage in the business unless he knows something of their  habits, etc.      [Illustration: A MINK TRAPPER.]    In the states bordering on Canada mink become prime usually by  November 1, while south along the Gulf of Mexico they do not \"prime  up\" until about December 1 and begin to shed by February, so that the  extreme Southern trapper has only about two months when the skins are  at their best. In the central sections such as Pennsylvania, Ohio,  Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, etc., the skins are prime by November 15  but begin to get pale in February if the winter is open.    While some fur bearing animals den up during severe weather mink do  not, and the trapper, even in the Far North, will find mink on the go  every night.    As mentioned elsewhere, the greater per cent. of the methods  published in this book are taken from the Hunter-Trader-Trapper, an  illustrated monthly magazine, of Columbus, Ohio, devoted to hunting,  trapping and raw furs. New trapping methods are constantly being  published in that magazine, as experienced trappers from all parts of  North America read and write for it.        CHAPTER II.    MINK AND THEIR HABITS.    The favorite haunts are along marshy shores of lakes, rivers, creeks  and other swampy places, and where muskrats are plenty there you are  almost sure to find mink. When hunting for mink the best place to  find them is in old muskrat holes near the point or end of an island,  and the next best place is under bridges where the approaches have  been filled in with stones or logs; there are other places not so  good, such as stone piles, heaps of fence rails, hollow logs, under  large stumps, and have even found them under snow banks where I knew  there were no holes at all.    The principal food of the mink is fish, birds and their eggs, frogs,  mice and small snails, and have had them partly eat muskrat while in  my traps. I do not know whether he can kill a muskrat or not, never  having seen him do it. No doubt there are many other things upon  which he feeds of which I do not know, but these are the principal  ones.    The mink is an animal of peculiar habits, sometimes remaining near  his burrow for weeks at a time, and then suddenly disappearing and  not returning for as much as seven or eight days, and all this time  he is roving around in search of food, running all night and lodging  in the best hole he can find when daybreak comes, and can often be  seen in early morning or in evening at dusk.      [Illustration: LOOKING FOR FOOD.]    The mink is not so hard to trap if you know his habits; when you find  he has left his burrow do not take up your trap, for he will surely  be back in a few days; when you come to a place where a mink has laid  up for the day (that is, in a temporary burrow), do not trap on the  route he has already traveled, for when he comes out he will go  straight on just as if he had just looked in and come out, but set  traps and bait; when he comes out he will be hungry and is sure to be  your mink.      [Illustration: GOOD SIGNS.]    In going from place to place mink often travel over the same route,  as between two swamps or ponds, and at times there is a well defined  runway through the grass; this habit can be studied in winter when  snow is deep, and also when swimming from the mainland to an island  or from one island to another; they will nearly always land in the  same place. Another thing, when finding a burrow look around, and if  you find his dung heap you may be sure he lives in that hole; minks'  dung can be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34094"],[0,"Journal of Entomology and Zoology, Vol. 11, No. 2, June 1919 (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net                      VOLUME ELEVEN    NUMBER TWO      JOURNAL    OF    ENTOMOLOGY    AND    ZOOLOGY      JUNE, 1919      PUBLISHED QUARTERLY BY    POMONA COLLEGE DEPARTMENT _of_ ZOOLOGY    CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA, U.

H.        (_Contribution from the Zoological Laboratory of Pomona College_)          Structure of Dolichoglossus Pusillus    ALMA EVANS      The animals were studied from serial sections cut in several planes. The  stains used were carmine, hematoxylin and eosin. The hematoxylin seemed  to show the tissues more clearly. A graphic reconstruction was  attempted, but did not prove satisfactory because of the individual  artificial foldings and contractions. The drawings were obtained by the  use of a camera lucida. The general drawings, Figs. 1-9 inclusive, are  not filled in in great detail. The special drawings are shown at greater  magnification with more of an attempt to show the actual condition.    Dolichoglossus is a soft worm-like animal with ciliated surface. It is  divided into three distinct regions: the proboscis, a long club-shaped  organ; the collar, a fold in the surface just behind the proboscis,  and the trunk, a long cylindrical portion posterior to the collar.    Dolichoglossus is a marine form living in sandy bays or sheltered  places. Mucous glands in the surface epithelium secrete a sticky fluid  which covers the body and to which tiny sand grains stick. The sand  clinging to the mucous coated surface forms a fragile temporary tube  in which the animal is usually secluded. The animals in the living  condition are bright orange or red but lose their color very soon  after preservation in alcohol or formalin.    The proboscis cavity extending the entire length of the organ is  surrounded by a network of connective tissue supported by longitudinal  bands of plain muscle. This cavity is supposed to communicate with the  exterior by a very small opening, the proboscis pore, but this did not  show in the specimens examined. The heart, proboscis gland and  notochord are located in the posterior part of the proboscis.    The collar contains the central nervous system, part of the notochord,  the dorsal blood vessel, ventral and dorsal mesenteries, mouth opening  and anterior part of the alimentary canal.    The trunk contains the alimentary canal, dorsal and ventral blood  vessels, dorsal and ventral nerves, the gill-slits, the reproductive  bodies, dorsal and ventral mesenteries and muscle bands.    The nervous system consists of three parts: the central, located in  the collar region, Fig. 5; the sub-epidermic network extending over  the entire body just under the surface epithelium, Figs. 1-7; and the  dorsal and ventral strands which are thickenings of the sub-epidermic  network extending throughout the trunk, Figs. 1 and 7. There is also  quite a decided thickening of the sub-epidermic network at the base of  the proboscis, Figs. 5, 6.    The vascular system consists of two parts, the central and the  peripheral. The central is made up of the heart, a thin-walled vesicle  at the base of the proboscis just dorsal to the notochord, and  connected with it the proboscis gland, a plexus of capillaries just  anterior to the notochord. Fig. 5. The peripheral system is composed  of a ventral and a dorsal vessel. The dorsal starts at the heart and  continues just ventral of the dorsal nerve throughout the length of  the body. Figs. 1, 5, 7. The ventral vessel extends from the posterior  border of the collar to the anal end. It is connected with the dorsal  vessel by a circular vessel in the posterior edge of the collar.    The mouth is situated ventrally at the base of the proboscis, within  the collar, and opens directly into the straight alimentary canal.  The latter is a straight tube extending from the mouth opening to the  anus. Figs. 5, 1, 7, 9.    The alimentary canal in the anterior part of the collar gives off a  diverticulum, which grows forward and supports the proboscis. Because  this diverticulum has the vacuolated appearance of the notochordal  tissue of higher animals, it has been regarded as a notochord. It is  largest at the base of the proboscis immediately anterior to the  heart. Figs. 5, 6.    The paired gill-slits occupy the region just posterior to the collar.  They are arranged in two longitudinal grooves in the dorsal wall. The  number increases throughout life, new slits appearing just behind  those already in place. I found about twenty-five to be the average  number, while particular individuals had as low as eighteen and twenty  and as high as thirty and thirty-one. The gills are formed in the  shape of a U. A skeletal rod or gill bar separates the gills from each  other. The gills are supplied with blood from the dorsal vessel. Figs.  3, 7, 8.    The sexes are distinct. The ovaries and testes are saccular organs  arranged in a row along the gill and succeeding region. The sacs in  other genera, for example Balanoglossus as described by Shipley, open  directly on to the epidermis. I have been unable to see these openings  in my preparations. Fig. 8 shows the position of the ovaries in the  female; the testes in the male are in a similar location.    The surface epithelium is modified ciliated columnar, varying slightly  in thickness, size of nuclei and size and shape of cell according to  location. Figs. 13, 14, 15.    The epithelium forming the gills and intestine is also modified  ciliated columnar. That of the gills having short narrow cells and  small nuclei, and that of the intestine having longer thicker cells  and large nuclei. Figs. 11, 10.    The connective tissue surrounding the proboscis cavity is of a  peculiar arrangement. The connective tissue itself consists of fine  strands loosely interwoven, but arranged in a definite manner. The  strands form a fine network which gives a beautiful lacy appearance.  Small round nuclei are quite numerous in connection with the strands.  Longitudinal bands of plain muscle are very conspicuous in the  connective tissue. These muscle bands are probably used in altering  the size and shape of the proboscis. Figs. 4, 20, 21.    The nervous tissue consists of many fibers thickly interwoven. There  are a few small nuclei scattered"]]]
