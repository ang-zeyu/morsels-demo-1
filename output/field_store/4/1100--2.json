These  essays, though they have no bearing upon the life of the fly, are  among the most interesting that Henri Fabre has written and will, I am  persuaded, make a special appeal to the reader. The chapter entitled The  Caddis Worm has been included as following directly upon The Pond.    Since publishing The Life of the Spider, I was much struck by a passage  in Dr. Chalmers Mitchell's stimulating work, The Childhood of Animals,  in which the secretary of the Zoological Society of London says: 'I have  attempted to avoid the use of terms familiar only to students of zoology  and to refrain from anatomical detail, but at the same time to refrain  from the irritating habit assuming that my readers have no knowledge, no  dictionaries and no other books.'    I began to wonder whether I had gone too far in simplifying the  terminology of the Fabre essays and in appending explanatory footnotes  to the inevitable number of outlandish names of insects. But my doubts  vanished when I thought upon Fabre's own words in the first chapter of  this book: 'If I write for men of learning, for philosophers...I write  above all things for the young. I want to make them love the natural  story which you make them hate; and that is why, while keeping strictly  to the domain of truth, I avoid your scientific prose, which too often,  alas, seems borrowed from some Iroquois idiom!'    And I can but apologize if I have been too lavish with my notes to this  chapter in particular, which introduces to us, as in a sort of litany,  a multitude of the insects studied by the author. For the rest, I have  continued my system of references to the earlier Fabre books, whether  translated by myself or others. Of the following essays, The Harmas has  appeared, under another title, in The Daily Mail; The Pond, Industrial  Chemistry and the two Chapters on the bluebottle in The English Review;  and The Harmas, The Pond and Industrial Chemistry in the New York  Bookman. The others are new to England and America, unless any of them  should be issued in newspapers or magazines between this date and the  publication of the book.    I wish once more to thank Miss Frances Rodwell for her assistance in the  details of my work and in the verification of the many references; and  my thanks are also due to Mr. Edward Cahen, who has been good enough to  revise the two chemistry chapters for me, and to Mr. W. S. Graff Baker,  who has performed the same kindly task towards the two chapters entitled  Mathematical Memories.--Alexander Teixeira de Mattos. Chelsea, 8 July,  1913.    [Recorder's Note: Most Translator's Footnotes have been omitted from  this text, but some of his references to localities and insect names  are included in brackets. I apologize to English readers for changes to  American spelling.]          CHAPTER I. THE HARMAS    This is what I wished for, hoc erat in votis: a bit of land, oh, not so  very large, but fenced in, to avoid the drawbacks of a public way; an  abandoned, barren, sun scorched bit of land, favored by thistles and by  wasps and bees. Here, without fear of being troubled by the passersby, I  could consult the Ammophila and the Sphex [two digger or hunting wasps]  and engage in that difficult conversation whose questions and answers  have experiment for their language; here, without distant expeditions  that take up my time, without tiring rambles that strain my nerves,  I could contrive my plans of attack, lay my ambushes and watch their  effects at every hour of the day. Hoc erat in votis. Yes, this was my  wish, my dream, always cherished, always vanishing into the mists of the  future.    And it is no easy matter to acquire a laboratory in the open fields,  when harassed by a terrible anxiety about one's daily bread. For forty  years have I fought, with steadfast courage, against the paltry plagues  of life; and the long-wished-for laboratory has come at last. What it  has cost me in perseverance and relentless work I will not try to say.  It has come; and, with it--a more serious condition--perhaps a little  leisure. I say perhaps, for my leg is still hampered with a few links of  the convict's chain.    The wish is realized. It is a little late, O my pretty insects! I  greatly fear that the peach is offered to me when I am beginning to  have no teeth wherewith to eat it. Yes, it is a little late: the wide  horizons of the outset have shrunk into a low and stifling canopy, more  and more straitened day by day. Regretting nothing in the past, save  those whom I have lost; regretting nothing, not even my first youth;  hoping nothing either, I have reached the point at which, worn out by  the experience of things, we ask ourselves if life be worth the living.    Amid the ruins that surround me, one strip of wall remains standing,  immovable upon its solid base: my passion for scientific truth. Is that  enough, O my busy insects, to enable me to add yet a few seemly pages  to your history? Will my strength not cheat my good intentions? Why,  indeed, did I forsake you so long? Friends have reproached me for it.  Ah, tell them, tell those friends, who are yours as well as mine,  tell them that it was not forgetfulness on my part, not weariness, nor  neglect: I thought of you; I was convinced that the Cerceris [a digger  wasp] cave had more fair secrets to reveal to us, that the chase of the  Sphex held fresh surprises in store. But time failed me; I was alone,  deserted, struggling against misfortune. Before philosophizing, one had  to live. Tell them that; and they will pardon me.    Others again have reproached me with my style, which has not the  solemnity, nay, better, the dryness of the schools. They fear lest a  page that is read without fatigue should not always be the expression  of the truth. Were I to take their word for it, we are profound only  on condition of being obscure. Come here, one and all of you--you, the  sting bearers, and you, the wing-cased armor-clads--take up my defense  and bear witness in my favor. Tell of the intimate terms on which I live  with you, of the patience with which I observe you, of the care with  which I record your actions. Your evidence is unanimous: yes, my pages,  though they bristle not with hollow formulas nor learned smatterings,  are the exact narrative of facts observed, neither more nor less; and  whoever cares to question you in his turn will, obtain the same replies.    And then, my dear insects, if you cannot convince those good people,  because you do not carry the weight of tedium, I, in my turn, will say  to them: 'You rip up the animal and I study it alive; you turn it into  an object of horror and pity, whereas I cause it to be loved; you labor  in a torture chamber and dissecting room, I make my observations under  the blue sky to the song of the cicadas, you subject cell and protoplasm  to chemical tests, I study instinct in its loftiest manifestations;  you pry into death, I pry into life. And why should I not complete  my thought: the boars have muddied the clear stream; natural history,  youth's glorious study, has, by dint of cellular improvements, become a  hateful and repulsive thing. Well, if I write for men of learning, for  philosophers, who, one day, will try to some extent to unravel the tough  problem of instinct, I write also, I write above all things for the  young. I want to make them love the natural history which you make them  hate; and that is why, while keeping strictly to the domain of truth, I  avoid your scientific prose, which too often, alas seems borrowed from  some Iroquois idiom.    But this is not my business for the moment: I want to speak of the  bit of land long cherished in my plans to form a laboratory of living  entomology, the bit of land which I have at last obtained in the  solitude of a little village. It is a harmas, the name given, in this  district [the country round Serignan, in Provence], to an untilled,  pebbly expanse abandoned to the vegetation of the thyme. It is too poor  to repay the work of the plow; but the sheep passes there in spring,  when it has chanced to rain and a little grass shoots up.    My harmas, however, because of its modicum of red earth swamped by a  huge mass of stones, has received a rough first attempt at cultivation:  I am told that vines once grew here. And, in fact, when we dig the  ground before planting a few trees, we turn up, here and there, remains  of the precious stock, half carbonized by time. The three pronged fork,  therefore, the only implement of husbandry that can penetrate such  a soil as this, has entered here; and I am sorry, for the primitive  vegetation has disappeared.

The convict of fiction has been hitherto shown only at the beginning or  at the end of his career. Either his exile has been the mysterious end  to his misdeeds, or he has appeared upon the scene to claim interest by  reason of an equally unintelligible love of crime acquired during his  experience in a penal settlement. Charles Reade has drawn the interior  of a house of correction in England, and Victor Hugo has shown how  a French convict fares after the fulfilment of his sentence. But  no writer--so far as I am aware--has attempted to depict the dismal  condition of a felon during his term of transportation.    I have endeavoured in \"His Natural Life\" to set forth the working and  the results of an English system of transportation carefully considered  and carried out under official supervision; and to illustrate in the  manner best calculated, as I think, to attract general attention, the  inexpediency of again allowing offenders against the law to be herded  together in places remote from the wholesome influence of public  opinion, and to be submitted to a discipline which must necessarily  depend for its just administration upon the personal character and  temper of their gaolers.    Your critical faculty will doubtless find, in the construction and  artistic working of this book, many faults. I do not think, however,  that you will discover any exaggerations. Some of the events narrated  are doubtless tragic and terrible; but I hold it needful to my purpose  to record them, for they are events which have actually occurred, and  which, if the blunders which produced them be repeated, must infallibly  occur again. It is true that the British Government have ceased to  deport the criminals of England, but the method of punishment, of which  that deportation was a part, is still in existence. Port Blair is a Port  Arthur filled with Indian-men instead of Englishmen; and, within the  last year, France has established, at New Caledonia, a penal settlement  which will, in the natural course of things, repeat in its annals the  history of Macquarie Harbour and of Norfolk Island.    With this brief preface I beg you to accept this work. I would that its  merits were equal either to your kindness or to my regard.

On the evening of May 3, 1827, the garden of a large red-brick  bow-windowed mansion called North End House, which, enclosed in spacious  grounds, stands on the eastern height of Hampstead Heath, between  Finchley Road and the Chestnut Avenue, was the scene of a domestic  tragedy.    Three persons were the actors in it. One was an old man, whose white  hair and wrinkled face gave token that he was at least sixty years  of age. He stood erect with his back to the wall, which separates the  garden from the Heath, in the attitude of one surprised into sudden  passion, and held uplifted the heavy ebony cane upon which he  was ordinarily accustomed to lean. He was confronted by a man of  two-and-twenty, unusually tall and athletic of figure, dresses in rough  seafaring clothes, and who held in his arms, protecting her, a lady  of middle age. The face of the young man wore an expression of  horror-stricken astonishment, and the slight frame of the grey-haired  woman was convulsed with sobs.    These three people were Sir Richard Devine, his wife, and his only son  Richard, who had returned from abroad that morning.    \"So, madam,\" said Sir Richard, in the high-strung accents which in  crises of great mental agony are common to the most self-restrained of  us, \"you have been for twenty years a living lie! For twenty years  you have cheated and mocked me. For twenty years--in company with  a scoundrel whose name is a byword for all that is profligate and  base--you have laughed at me for a credulous and hood-winked fool; and  now, because I dared to raise my hand to that reckless boy, you confess  your shame, and glory in the confession!\"    \"Mother, dear mother!\" cried the young man, in a paroxysm of grief, \"say  that you did not mean those words; you said them but in anger! See, I am  calm now, and he may strike me if he will.\"    Lady Devine shuddered, creeping close, as though to hide herself in the  broad bosom of her son.    The old man continued: \"I married you, Ellinor Wade, for your beauty;  you married me for my fortune. I was a plebeian, a ship's carpenter; you  were well born, your father was a man of fashion, a gambler, the friend  of rakes and prodigals. I was rich. I had been knighted. I was in favour  at Court. He wanted money, and he sold you. I paid the price he asked,  but there was nothing of your cousin, my Lord Bellasis and Wotton, in  the bond.\"    \"Spare me, sir, spare me!\" said Lady Ellinor faintly.    \"Spare you! Ay, you have spared me, have you not? Look ye,\" he cried,  in sudden fury, \"I am not to be fooled so easily. Your family are proud.  Colonel Wade has other daughters. Your lover, my Lord Bellasis, even  now, thinks to retrieve his broken fortunes by marriage. You have  confessed your shame. To-morrow your father, your sisters, all the  world, shall know the story you have told me!\"    \"By Heaven, sir, you will not do this!\" burst out the young man.    \"Silence, bastard!\" cried Sir Richard. \"Ay, bite your lips; the word is  of your precious mother's making!\"    Lady Devine slipped through her son's arms and fell on her knees at her  husband's feet.    \"Do not do this, Richard. I have been faithful to you for two-and-twenty  years. I have borne all the slights and insults you have heaped upon me.  The shameful secret of my early love broke from me when in your rage,  you threatened him. Let me go away; kill me; but do not shame me.\"    Sir Richard, who had turned to walk away, stopped suddenly, and his  great white eyebrows came together in his red face with a savage scowl.  He laughed, and in that laugh his fury seemed to congeal into a cold and  cruel hate.    \"You would preserve your good name then. You would conceal this disgrace  from the world. You shall have your wish--upon one condition.\"    \"What is it, sir?\" she asked, rising, but trembling with terror, as she  stood with drooping arms and widely opened eyes.    The old man looked at her for an instant, and then said slowly, \"That  this impostor, who so long has falsely borne my name, has wrongfully  squandered my money, and unlawfully eaten my bread, shall pack! That he  abandon for ever the name he has usurped, keep himself from my sight,  and never set foot again in house of mine.\"    \"You would not part me from my only son!\" cried the"]]]
