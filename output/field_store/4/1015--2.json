LONDON: HUMPHREY MILFORD    OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS    1919          PREFACE    In writing this book the author has aimed first to present in readable  form the main facts about the geographical environment of American  history. Many important facts have been omitted or have been touched  upon only lightly because they are generally familiar. On the other  hand, special stress has been laid on certain broad phases of geography  which are comparatively unfamiliar. One of these is the similarity of  form between the Old World and the New, and between North and South  America; another is the distribution of indigenous types of vegetation  in North America; and a third is the relation of climate to health and  energy. In addition to these subjects, the influence of geographical  conditions upon the life of the primitive Indians has been emphasized.  This factor is especially important because people without iron tools  and beasts of burden, and without any cereal crops except corn, must  respond to their environment very differently from civilized people of  today. Limits of space and the desire to make this book readable have  led to the omission of the detailed proof of some of the conclusions  here set forth. The special student will recognize such cases and  will not judge them until he has read the author's fuller statements  elsewhere. The general reader, for whom this book is designed, will be  thankful for the omission of such purely technical details.    CONTENTS    I. THE APPROACHES TO AMERICA II. THE FORM OF THE CONTINENT III. THE  GEOGRAPHIC PROVINCES OF NORTH AMERICA IV. THE GARMENT OF VEGETATION V.  THE RED MAN IN AMERICA BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE        THE RED MAN'S CONTINENT      CHAPTER I. THE APPROACHES TO AMERICA    Across the twilight lawn at Hampton Institute straggles a group of  sturdy young men with copper-hued complexions. Their day has been  devoted to farming, carpentry, blacksmithing, or some other trade. Their  evening will be given to study. Those silent dignified Indians with  straight black hair and broad, strong features are training their hands  and minds in the hope that some day they may stand beside the white man  as equals. Behind them, laughing gayly and chattering as if without a  care in the world, comes a larger group of kinky-haired, thick-lipped  youths with black skins and African features. They, too, have been  working with the hands to train the mind. Those two diverse races, red  and black, sit down together in a classroom, and to them comes another  race. The faces that were expressionless or merely mirthful a minute ago  light up with serious interest as the teacher comes into the room. She  stands there a slender, golden-haired, blue-eyed Anglo-Saxon girl  just out of college--a mere child compared with the score of swarthy,  stalwart men as old as herself who sit before her. Her mobile features  seem to mirror a hundred thoughts while their impassive faces are moved  by only one. Her quick speech almost trips in its eagerness not to waste  the short, precious hour. Only a strong effort holds her back while she  waits for the slow answers of the young men whom she drills over and  over again in simple problems of arithmetic. The class and the teacher  are an epitome of American history. They are more than that. They are an  epitome of all history.    History in its broadest aspect is a record of man's migrations from  one environment to another. America is the last great goal of these  migrations. He who would understand its history must know its mountains  and plains, its climate, its products, and its relation to the sea and  to other parts of the world. He must know more than this, however,  for he must appreciate how various environments alter man's energy and  capacity and give his character a slant in one direction or another.  He must also know the paths by which the inhabitants have reached their  present homes, for the influence of former environments upon them may be  more important than their immediate surroundings. In fact, the history  of North America has been perhaps more profoundly influenced by man's  inheritance from his past homes than by the physical features of his  present home. It is indeed of vast importance that trade can move freely  through such natural channels as New York Harbor, the Mohawk Valley, and  the Great Lakes. It is equally important that the eastern highlands of  the United States are full of the world's finest coal, while the central  plains raise some of the world's most lavish crops. Yet it is probably  even more important that because of his inheritance from a remote  ancestral environment man is energetic, inventive, and long-lived in  certain parts of the American continent, while elsewhere he has not the  strength and mental vigor to maintain even the degree of civilization to  which he seems to have risen.    Three streams of migration have mainly determined the history of  America. One was an ancient and comparatively insignificant stream from  Asia. It brought the Indian to the two great continents which the white  man has now practically wrested from him. A second and later stream was  the great tide which rolled in from Europe. It is as different from the  other as West is from East. Thus far it has not wholly obliterated the  native people, for between the southern border of the United States on  the one hand, and the northern borders of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay  on the other, the vast proportion of the blood is still Indian. The  European tide may in time dominate even this region, but for centuries  to come the poor, disinherited Indians will continue to form the bulk of  the population. The third stream flowed from Africa and was as different  from either of the others as South is from North.    The differences between one and another of these three streams of  population and the antagonisms which they have involved have greatly  colored American history. The Indian, the European, and the Negro  apparently differ not only in outward appearance but in the much more  important matter of mentality. According to Brinton * the average brain  capacity of Parisians, including adults of both sexes, is 1448 cubic  centimeters. That of the American Indian is 1376, and that of the Negro  1344 cubic centimeters. With this difference in size there appears to  be a corresponding difference in function. Thus far not enough accurate  tests have been made upon Indians to enable us to draw reliable  conclusions. The Negro, however, has been tested on an extensive  scale. The results seem to leave little doubt that there are real and  measurable differences in the mental powers of races, just as we know  to be the case among individuals. The matter is so important that we may  well dwell on it a moment before turning to the cause of the differences  in the three streams of American immigrants. If there is a measurable  difference between the inherent brain power of the white race and  the black, it is practically certain that there are also measurable  differences between the white and the red.          * D. G. Brinton. \"The American Race.\"      Numerous tests indicate that in the lower mental powers there is no  great difference between the black and the white. In physical reactions  one is as quick as the other. In the capacity of the senses and in the  power to perceive and to discriminate between different kinds of objects  there is also practical equality. When it comes to the higher faculties,  however, such as judgment, inventiveness, and the power of organization,  a difference begins to be apparent. These, as Ferguson * says, are  the traits that \"divide mankind into the able and the mediocre, the  brilliant and the dull, and they determine the progress of civilization  more directly than do the simple fundamental powers which man has in  common with the lower animals.\" On the basis of the most exhaustive  study yet made, Ferguson believes that, apart from all differences due  to home training and environment, the average intellectual power of the  colored people of this country is only about three-fourths as great as  that of white persons of the same amount of training. He believes it  probable, indeed, that this estimate is too high rather than too low. As  to the Indian, his past achievements and present condition indicate that  intellectually he stands between the white man and the Negro in about  the position that would be expected from the capacity of his brain. If  this is so, the mental differences in the three streams of migration  to America are fully as great as the outward and manifest physical  differences and far more important.          * G. O. Ferguson. \"The Psychology of the Negro,\" New York, 1916.      Why does the American Indian differ from the Negro, and the European  from both? This is a question on which we can only speculate. But we  shall find it profitable to study the paths by which these diverse races  found their way to America from man's primeval home. According to the  now almost universally accepted theory, all the races of mankind had  a common origin. But where did man make the change from a four-handed,  tree-dwelling little ape to a much larger, upright creature with two  hands and two feet? It is a mistake to suppose that because he is  hairless he must have originated in a warm climate. In fact quite the  opposite seems to be the case, for apparently he lost his hair because  he took to wearing the skins of slain beasts in order that he might have  not only his own hair but that of other animals as a protection from the  cold.    In our search for the starting-place of man's slow migration to America  our first step should be to ascertain what responses to physical  environment "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30666"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net            Transcriber's Note: A couple of unusual spellings in the \"ads\"  have been left as printed.             *       *       *       *       *            #BIRDS Volume I.#         January to June, 1897                NOW READY.
