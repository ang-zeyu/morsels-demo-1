THE LORD BALTIMORE PRESS   BALTIMORE, M.D., U.S.A.          PREFACE.      In its original form this essay was the dissertation submitted for a  doctorate in philosophy conferred by Yale University in 1908. When first  projected it was the writer's purpose to take up the subject of English  witchcraft under certain general political and social aspects. It was  not long, however, before he began to feel that preliminary to such a  treatment there was necessary a chronological survey of the witch  trials. Those strange and tragic affairs were so closely involved with  the politics, literature, and life of the seventeenth century that one  is surprised to find how few of them have received accurate or complete  record in history. It may be said, in fact, that few subjects have  gathered about themselves so large concretions of misinformation as  English witchcraft. This is largely, of course, because so little  attention has been given to it by serious students of history. The  mistakes and misunderstandings of contemporary writers and of the local  historians have been handed down from county history to county history  until many of them have crept into general works. For this reason it was  determined to attempt a chronological treatment which would give a  narrative history of the more significant trials along with some account  of the progress of opinion. This plan has been adhered to somewhat  strictly, sometimes not without regret upon the part of the writer. It  is his hope later in a series of articles to deal with some of the more  general phases of the subject, with such topics as the use of torture,  the part of the physicians, the contagious nature of the witch alarms,  the relation of Puritanism to persecution, the supposed influence of the  Royal Society, the general causes for the gradual decline of the belief,  and other like questions. It will be seen in the course of the narrative  that some of these matters have been touched upon.    This study of witchcraft has been limited to a period of about one  hundred and sixty years in English history. The year 1558 has been  chosen as the starting point because almost immediately after the  accession of Elizabeth there began the movement for a new law, a  movement which resulted in the statute of 1563. With that statute the  history of the persecution of witches gathers importance. The year 1718  has been selected as a concluding date because that year was marked by  the publication of Francis Hutchinson's notable attack upon the belief.  Hutchinson levelled a final and deadly blow at the dying superstition.  Few men of intelligence dared after that avow any belief in the reality  of witchcraft; it is probable that very few even secretly cherished such  a belief. A complete history would of course include a full account both  of the witch trials from Anglo-Saxon times to Elizabeth's accession and  of the various witch-swimming incidents of the eighteenth century. The  latter it has not seemed worth while here to consider. The former would  involve an examination of all English sources from the earliest times  and would mean a study of isolated and unrelated trials occurring at  long intervals (at least, we have record only of such) and chiefly in  church courts. The writer has not undertaken to treat this earlier  period; he must confess to but small knowledge of it. In the few pages  which he has given to it he has attempted nothing more than to sketch  from the most obvious sources an outline of what is currently known as  to English witches and witchcraft prior to the days of Elizabeth. It is  to be hoped that some student of medieval society will at some time make  a thorough investigation of the history of witchcraft in England to the  accession of the great Queen.    For the study of the period to be covered in this monograph there exists  a wealth of material. It would perhaps not be too much to say that  everything in print and manuscript in England during the last half of  the sixteenth and the entire seventeenth century should be read or at  least glanced over. The writer has limited himself to certain kinds of  material from which he could reasonably expect to glean information.  These sources fall into seven principal categories. Most important of  all are the pamphlets, or chapbooks, dealing with the history of  particular alarms and trials and usually concluding with the details of  confession and execution. Second only to them in importance are the  local or municipal records, usually court files, but sometimes merely  expense accounts. In the memoirs and diaries can be found many mentions  of trials witnessed by the diarist or described to him. The newspapers  of the time, in their eagerness to exploit the unusual, seize gloatingly  upon the stories of witchcraft. The works of local historians and  antiquarians record in their lists of striking and extraordinary events  within their counties or boroughs the several trials and hangings for  the crime. The writers, mainly theologians, who discuss the theory and  doctrine of witchcraft illustrate the principles they lay down by cases  that have fallen under their observation. Lastly, the state papers  contain occasional references to the activities of the Devil and of his  agents in the realm.    Besides these seven types of material there should be named a few others  less important. From the pamphlet accounts of the criminal dockets at  the Old Bailey and Newgate, leaflets which were published at frequent  intervals after the Restoration, are to be gleaned mentions of perhaps  half a dozen trials for witchcraft. The plays of Dekker, Heywood, and  Shadwell must be used by the student, not because they add information  omitted elsewhere, but because they offer some clue to the way in which  the witches at Edmonton and Lancaster were regarded by the public. If  the pamphlet narrative of the witch of Edmonton had been lost, it might  be possible to reconstruct from the play of Dekker, Ford, and Rowley  some of the outlines of the story. It would be at best a hazardous  undertaking. To reconstruct the trials at Lancaster from the plays of  Heywood and Brome or from that of Shadwell would be quite impossible.  The ballads present a form of evidence much like that of the plays. Like  the plays, they happen all to deal with cases about which we are already  well informed. In general, they seem to follow the narratives and  depositions faithfully.    No mention has been made of manuscript sources. Those used by the author  have all belonged to one or other of the types of material described.    It has been remarked that there is current a large body of  misinformation about English witchcraft. It would be ungrateful of the  author not to acknowledge that some very good work has been done on the  theme. The Reverend Francis Hutchinson, as already mentioned, wrote in  1718 an epoch-making history of the subject, a book which is still  useful and can never be wholly displaced. In 1851 Thomas Wright brought  out his _Narratives of Sorcery and Magic_, a work at once entertaining  and learned. Wright wrote largely from original sources and wrote with a  good deal of care. Such blunders as he made were the result of haste and  of the want of those materials which we now possess. Mrs. Lynn Linton's  _Witch Stories_, published first in 1861, is a better book than might be  supposed from a casual glance at it. It was written with no more serious  purpose than to entertain, but it is by no means to be despised. So far  as it goes, it represents careful work. It would be wrong to pass over  Lecky's brilliant essay on witchcraft in his _History of Rationalism_,  valuable of course rather as an interpretation than as an historical  account. Lecky said many things about witchcraft that needed to be said,  and said them well. It is my belief that his verdicts as to the  importance of sundry factors may have to be modified; but, however that  be, the importance of his essay must always be recognized. One must not  omit in passing James Russell Lowell's charming essay on the subject.  Both Lecky and Lowell of course touched English witchcraft but lightly.  Since Mrs. Lynn Linton's no careful treatment of English witchcraft  proper has appeared. In 1907, however, Professor Kittredge published his  _Notes on Witchcraft_, the sixty-seven pages of which with their  footnotes contain a more scrupulous sifting of the evidence as to  witchcraft in England than is to be found in any other treatment.  Professor Kittredge is chiefly interested in English witchcraft as it  relates itself to witchcraft in New England, but his work contains much  that is fresh about the belief in England. As to the role and the  importance of various actors in the drama and as to sundry minor  matters, the writer has found himself forced to divergence of view. He  recognizes nevertheless the importance of Professor Kittredge's  contribution to the study of the whole subject and acknowledges his own  indebtedness to the essay for suggestion and guidance.    The author cannot hope that the work here presented is final.  Unfortunately there is still hidden away in England an unexplored mass  of local records. Some of them no doubt contain accounts of witch  trials. I have used chiefly such printed and manuscript materials as  were accessible in London and Oxford.

DEACON AND ARTIE L. METCALF    (Contribution from The State Biological Survey, and The Department of  Zoology of The University of Kansas)      _Introduction_    The Wakarusa River rises in the eastern edge of the Flint Hills and  flows approximately 50 miles in an easterly direction and empties into  the Kansas River near Eudora; with its tributaries, the Wakarusa drains  458 square miles in parts of Wabaunsee, Shawnee, Osage, and Douglas  counties of northeastern Kansas (Fig. 1). The average gradient is 6.3  feet per mile. Turbidity is consistently more than 100 ppm in the lower  portions of the mainstream and major tributaries, but is usually lower  in the upper portions of tributaries. The channel of the mainstream is  intrenched in its own alluvium (Dufford, 1958:36) and has high, muddy  banks and mud- or sand-bottom; the upper parts of tributaries have  lower banks and bottoms of gravel, rubble, or bedrock, although a few  (such as Cole Creek) have areas of sandy bottom. A fringe forest of  deciduous trees occurs along most streams. The topography and geology  of the area have been discussed by Todd (1911), Franzen and Leonard  (1943), and Dufford (1958).    The five-year period prior to 1957 was the driest in the 70-year  history of weather-records in Kansas (Metzler _et al._, 1958). Streams  throughout the Wakarusa Basin suffered intermittency and, according to  Mr. Melvon H. Wertzberger, the local Work Unit Conservationist with the  Soil Conservation Service, many of them dried completely or contained  only a few widely-scattered, stagnant pools. The effect of the drought  on stream-flow at the mainstream gaging station 2.1 miles south of  Lawrence is presented in Table 1.    According to the Division of Sanitation, Kansas State Board of Health,  no untreated domestic sewage or industrial waste is discharged into the  Wakarusa River System at this time.    The Wakarusa Watershed Association is in the preliminary stages of  establishing a watershed control project in the basin. Objectives of  the project are the improvement of land-use practices and the  construction of several headwater retention structures. Such a program  should have a long-range effect on the physical and biological  characteristics of the streams of the basin. With this in mind we think  it important to document the nature of the present fish-fauna and to  attempt a historical resume of the fauna, based on collections made in  the past sixty years.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map of the Wakarusa River and its principal  tributaries.]      _Methods_    Sodium cyanide, a 110-volt (600-watt) A.C. electric shocker, and  seines (6, 12, and 25 feet long, 4 to 8 feet deep having 1/4-in. mesh)  were used to collect fish in 1959. All fishes were preserved and  examined in the laboratory with the exception of large, common species  that were identified in the field and returned to the stream.    TABLE 1.
