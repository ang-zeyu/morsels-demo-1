To-day there is no Sphinx to fear, yet the world is full of unguessed  riddles. No thoughtful man can go far afield but some bird or flower or  stone bars his way with a question demanding an answer; and though many  men have been diligently spelling out the answers for many years, and we  for the most part must study the answers they have proved, and must  reply in their words, yet those shrewd old riddlers, the birds and  flowers and bees, are always ready for a new victim, putting their heads  together over some new enigma to bar the road to knowledge till that,  too, shall be answered; so that other men's learning does not always  suffice. So much of a man's pleasure in life, so much of his power,  depends on his ability to silence these persistent questioners, that  this little book was written with the hope of making clearer the kind of  questions Dame Nature asks, and the way to get correct answers.    This is purposely a _little_ book, dealing only with a single group of  birds, treating particularly only some of the commoner species of that  group, taking up only a few of the problems that present themselves to  the naturalist for solution, and aiming rather to make the reader  _acquainted with_ the birds than _learned about_ them.    The woodpeckers were selected in preference to any other family because  they are patient under observation, easily identified, resident in all  parts of the country both in summer and in winter, and because more than  any other birds they leave behind them records of their work which may  be studied after the birds have flown. The book provides ample means for  identifying every species and subspecies of woodpecker known in North  America, though only five of the commonest and most interesting species  have been selected for special study. At least three of these five  should be found in almost every part of the country. The Californian  woodpecker is never seen in the East, nor the red-headed in the far  West, but the downy and the hairy are resident nearly everywhere, and  some species of the flickers and sapsuckers, if not always the ones  chosen for special notice, are visitors in most localities.    Look for the woodpeckers in orchards and along the edges of thickets,  among tangles of wild grapes and in patches of low, wild berries, upon  which they often feed, among dead trees and in the track of forest  fires. Wherever there are boring larvae, beetles, ants, grasshoppers, the  fruit of poison-ivy, dogwood, june-berry, wild cherry or wild grapes,  woodpeckers may be confidently looked for if there are any in the  neighborhood. Be patient, persistent, wide-awake, sure that you see what  you think you see, careful to remember what you have seen, studious to  compare your observations, and keen to hear the questions propounded  you. If you do this seven years and a day, you will earn the name of  Naturalist; and if you travel the road of the naturalist with curious  patience, you may some day become as famous a riddle-reader as was that  Oedipus, the king of Thebes, who slew the Sphinx.          I    HOW TO KNOW A WOODPECKER      The woodpecker is the easiest of all birds to recognize. Even if  entirely new to you, you may readily decide whether a bird is a  woodpecker or not.    The woodpecker is always striking and is often gay in color. He is  usually noisy, and his note is clear and characteristic. His shape and  habits are peculiar, so that whenever you see a bird clinging to the  side of a tree \"as if he had been thrown at it and stuck,\" you may  safely call him a woodpecker. Not that all birds which cling to the bark  of trees are woodpeckers,--for the chickadees, the crested titmice, the  nuthatches, the brown creepers, and a few others like the kinglets and  some wrens and wood-warblers more or less habitually climb up and down  the tree-trunks; but these do it with a pretty grace wholly unlike the  woodpecker's awkward, cling-fast way of holding on. As the largest of  these is smaller than the smallest woodpecker, and as none of them  (excepting only the tiny kinglets) ever shows the patch of yellow or  scarlet which always marks the head of the male woodpecker, and which  sometimes adorns his mate, there is no danger of making mistakes.    The nuthatches are the only birds likely to be confused with  woodpeckers, and these have the peculiar habit of traveling down a  tree-trunk with their heads pointing to the ground. A woodpecker never  does this; he may move down the trunk of the tree he is working on, but  he will do it by hopping backward. A still surer sign of the woodpecker  is the way he sits upon his tail, using it to brace him. No other birds  except the chimney swift and the little brown creeper ever do this. A  sure mark, also, is his feet, which have two toes turned forward and two  turned backward. We find this arrangement in no other North American  birds except the cuckoos and our one native parroquet. However, there is  one small group of woodpeckers which have but three toes, and these are  the only North American land-birds that do not have four well-developed  toes.    In coloration the woodpeckers show a strong family likeness. Except in  some young birds, the color is always brilliant and often is gaudy.  Usually it shows much clear black and white, with dashes of scarlet or  yellow about the head. Sometimes the colors are \"solid,\" as in the  red-headed woodpecker; sometimes they lie in close bars, as in the  red-bellied species; sometimes in spots and stripes, as in the downy and  hairy; but there is always a _contrast_, never any blending of hues. The  red or yellow is laid on in well-defined patches--square, oblong, or  crescentic--upon the crown, the nape, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35070"],[0,"Franz Schubert : The Story of the Boy Who Wrote Beautiful Songs (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net                                                CHILD'S OWN BOOK                            _of Great Musicians_                                  SCHUBERT                                   [Illustration]                                        _By_                               THOMAS TAPPER                                THEODORE PRESSER CO.                            1712 CHESTNUT STREET                                PHILADELPHIA                                    HOW TO USE THIS BOOK      This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF GREAT  MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of \"Pictures from the Lives  of the Great Composers for Children,\" \"Music Talks with Children,\"  \"First Studies in Music Biography,\" and others.    The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the  child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place  throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as  will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to  cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the  corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around  each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.    After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the  book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the  great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous  pages.    The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the  cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's  own book.    This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting  task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to  the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth  while.                       *       *       *       *       *    This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians includes at  present a book on each of the following:        Bach                    Grieg                   Mozart      Beethoven               Handel                  Nevin      Brahms                  Haydn                   Schubert      Chopin                  Liszt                   Schumann      Dvorak                  MacDowell               Tschaikowsky      Foster                  Mendelssohn             Verdi                                                      Wagner                              Printed in U.

One might say of Schubert that he was born with a spring of melody in  his heart and a song on his lips.    Can anyone make a melody more lovely than this?                         [Illustration: No. 2                       FROM SCHUBERT'S SONG \"TROUT.\"]    Play it or have someone play it to you.    Is it not worth remembering all one's life?    Schubert composed many kinds of music, but his songs are most loved by  everybody.    They are sung all over the world.    And just because he never let a song come from his lips that did not  first come from his heart.    Is not this a jolly one?                       [Illustration: No. 3                     FROM SCHUBERT'S SONG \"WANDERING.\"]    Schubert's full name was FRANZ PETER SCHUBERT.    He was born in Vienna, in a very simple house that looks quite  old-fashioned.    Over the doorway there is a bust of Schubert, a few inches high.    And a sign on the house says: Franz Schubert's Birthplace.                         [Illustration: No. 4                       FRANZ SCHUBERT'S BIRTHPLACE.]    Dates are easy to remember if we write them. So you must ask your  teacher when Schubert was born and put in the date in the next sentence.    Franz Schubert was born in.........    At that time the great American authors Washington Irving, James  Fenimore Cooper, and William Cullen Bryant were all boys.                              [Illustration: No. 5                            IRVING.]                              [Illustration: No. 6                            COOPER.]                              [Illustration: No. 7                            BRYANT.]    You may not know so much about them now, but some day they will be quite  as good friends as any you will ever make.    Even though these boys were a little older than Franz Schubert, let us  always think of them together.    Then, of course, we should think of Schubert together with the composers  who lived when he did.    Here are some whose names you can remember very easily.                              [Illustration: No. 8                            VON WEBER.]                              [Illustration: No. 9                            ROSSINI.]                              [Illustration: No. 10                            CZERNY.]                              [Illustration: No. 11                            DONIZETTI.]    Czerny was born in the year 1794, and wrote many studies for the piano.    How much older was he than Franz Schubert?    Von Weber wrote operas and conducted them himself. He was born eleven  years before Schubert.    Rossini was an Italian composer of operas, born in 1792, five years  before Schubert. Schubert's life was so short, however, that Rossini  lived forty years longer than the great song writer.    Donizetti was an Italian opera composer. One of his well-known operas  was Lucia di Lammermoor. He was born in 1797, just as Schubert was.    Franz's father was a schoolmaster, and so was Franz himself for three  years.    He taught the little children of Vienna their A-B-C's, and how to do  sums. Of course, he helped them to learn to read.    Sometimes we find it quite hard to take one piano lesson or violin  lesson a week.    But from the time when Franz Schubert was a very little boy he had  lessons every week for violin, voice, and piano.    A little later he began to study harmony with a very famous man who knew  Mozart. His name was ANTONIO SALIERI.                              [Illustration: No. 12                            ANTONIO SALIERI.]    With so many lessons and with school work just as we have it, Franz must  have been a very busy boy.    He was quite poor and often very hungry; but in spite of that he was  always good natured and full of fun.    At eleven years of age he became a singer in the chapel of the Emperor.  It was here that Salieri was director.    Franz sang in the choir until he was nearly seventeen. Then he became a  schoolmaster, because, of course, he had to earn his living.    Wherever he was Franz was thinking music and composing it. Once he wrote  a song called _The Serenade_ at a table outside an inn.    An artist has made a picture of this.                       [Illustration: No. 13                     SCHUBERT WRITING \"THE SERENADE.\"]    Once Schubert was seen by his boyhood friends busily writing a new song.
