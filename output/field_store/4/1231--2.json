NEW YORK:      THE INDUSTRIAL PUBLICATION COMPANY.      1877.          THE MICROSCOPE.      Microscope, the name of an instrument for enabling the eye to see  distinctly objects which are placed at a very short distance from it,  or to see magnified images of small objects, and therefore to see  smaller objects than would otherwise be visible. The name is derived  from the two Greek words, expressing this property, MIKROS, _small_,  and SKOPEO, _to see_.    So little is known of the early history of the microscope, and so  certain is it that the magnifying power of lenses must have been  discovered as soon as lenses were made, that there is no reason for  hazarding any doubtful speculations on the question of discovery. We  shall proceed therefore at once to describe the simplest forms of  microscopes, to explain their later and more important improvements,  and finally to exhibit the instrument in its present perfect state.    In doing this we shall assume that the reader is familiar with the  information contained in the articles \"Light,\" \"Lens,\" \"Achromatic,\"  \"Aberration,\" and the other sub-divisions of the science of Optics,  which are treated of in this work.    The use of the term _magnifying_ has led many into a misconception of  the nature of the effect produced by convex lenses. It is not always  understood that the so-called magnifying power of a lens applied to  the eye, as in a microscope, is derived from its enabling the eye to  approach more nearly to its object than would otherwise be compatible  with distinct vision. The common occurrence of walking across the  street to read a bill is in fact magnifying the bill by approach; and  the observer, at every step he takes, makes a change in the optical  arrangement of his eye, to adapt it to the lessening distance between  himself and the object of his inquiry. This power of spontaneous  adjustment is so unconsciously exerted, that unless the attention be  called to it by circumstances, we are totally unaware of its exercise.    In the case just mentioned the bill would be read with eyes in a very  different state of adjustment from that in which it was discovered on  the opposite side of the street, but no conviction of this fact would  be impressed upon the mind. If, however, the supposed individual  should perceive on some part of the paper a small speck, which he  suspects to be a minute insect, and if he should attempt a very close  approach of his eye for the purpose of verifying his suspicion, he  would presently find that the power of natural adjustment has a limit;  for when his eye has arrived within about ten inches, he will discover  that a further approach produces only confusion. But if, as he  continues to approach, he were to place before his eye a series of  properly arranged convex lenses, he would see the object gradually and  distinctly increase in apparent size by the mere continuance of the  operation of approaching. Yet the glasses applied to the eye during  the approach from ten inches to one inch, would have done nothing more  than had been previously done by the eye itself during the approach  from fifty feet to one foot. In both cases the magnifying is effected  really by the approach, the lenses merely rendering the latter periods  of the approach compatible with distinct vision.    A very striking proof of this statement may be obtained by the  following simple and instructive experiment. Take any minute object, a  very small insect for instance, held on a pin or gummed to a slip of  glass; then present it to a strong light, and look at it through the  finest needle-hole in a blackened card placed about an inch before it.  The insect will appear quite distinct, and about ten times larger than  its usual size. Then suddenly withdraw the card without disturbing the  object, which will instantly become indistinct and nearly invisible.  The reason is, that the naked eye cannot see at so small a distance as  one inch. But the card with the hole having enabled the eye to  approach within an inch, and to see distinctly at that distance, is  thus proved to be as decidedly a magnifying instrument as any lens or  combination of lenses.    This description of magnifying power does not apply to such  instruments as the solar or gas microscope, by which we look not at  the object itself, but at its shadow or picture on the wall; and the  description will require some modification in treating of the compound  microscope, where, as in the telescope, an image or picture is formed  by one lens, that image or picture being viewed as an original object  by another lens.    It is nevertheless so important to obtain a clear notion of the real  nature of the effect produced by a lens applied to the eye, that we  will adduce the instance of spectacles to render the point more  familiar. If the person who has been supposed to cross the street for  the purpose of reading a bill had been aged, the limit to the power of  adjustment would have been discovered at a greater distance, and  without so severe a test as the supposed insect. The eyes of the very  aged generally lose the power of adjustment at a distance of thirty or  forty inches instead of ten, and the spectacles worn in consequence  are as much magnifying glasses to them as the lenses employed by  younger eyes to examine the most minute objects. Spectacles are  magnifying glasses to the aged because they enable such persons to see  as closely to their objects as the young, and therefore to see the  objects larger than they could themselves otherwise see them, but not  larger than they are seen by the unassisted younger eye.    In saying that an object appears larger at one time, or to one person,  than another, it is necessary to guard against misconception. By the  apparent size of an object we mean the angle it subtends at the eye,  or the angle formed by two lines drawn from the centre of the eye to  the extremities of the object. In Fig. 1, the lines A E and B E drawn  from the arrow to the eye form the angle A E B, which, when the angle  is small, is nearly twice as great as the angle C E D, formed by lines  drawn from a similar arrow at twice the distance. The arrow A B will  therefore appear nearly twice as long as C D, being seen under twice  the angle, and in the same proportion for any greater or lesser  difference in distance. The angle in question is called the angle of  vision, or the visual angle.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    The angle of vision must, however, not be confounded with the angle of  the pencil of light by which an object is seen, and which is explained  in Fig. 2. Here we have drawn two arrows placed in relation to the eye  as before, and from the centre of each have drawn lines exhibiting the  quantity of light which each point will send into the eye at the  respective distances.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    Now if E F represent the diameter of the pupil, the angle E A F shows  the size of the cone or pencil of light which enters the eye from the  point A, and in like manner the angle E B F is that of the pencil  emanating from B, and entering the eye. Then, since E A F is double E  B F, it is evident that A is seen by four times the quantity of light  which could be received from an equally illuminated point at B; so  that the nearer body would appear brighter if it did not appear  larger; but as its apparent area is increased four times as well as  its light, no difference in this respect is discovered. But if we  could find means to send into the eye a larger pencil of light, as for  instance that shown by the lines G A H, without increasing the  apparent size in the same proportion, it is evident that we should  obtain a benefit totally distinct from that of increased magnitude,  and one which is in some cases of even more importance than size in  developing the structure of what we wish to examine. This, it will be  hereafter shown, is sometimes done; for the present, we wish merely to  explain clearly the distinction between apparent magnitude, or the  angle under which the object is seen, and apparent brightness, or the  angle of the pencil of light by which each of its points is seen, and  with these explanations we shall continue to employ the common  expressions magnifying glass and magnifying power.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    The magnifying power of a single lens depends upon its focal length,  the object being in fact placed nearly in its principal focus, or so  that the light which diverges from each point may, after refraction by  the lens, proceed in parallel lines to the eye, or as nearly so as is  requisite for distinct vision. In Fig. 3, A B is a double convex lens,  near which is a small arrow to represent the object under examination,  and the cones drawn from its extremities are portions of the rays of  light diverging from those points and falling upon the lens. These  rays, if suffered to fall at once upon the pupil, would be too  divergent to permit their being brought to a focus upon the retina by  the optical arrangements of the eye. But being first passed through  the lens, they are bent into nearly parallel lines, or into lines  diverging from some points within the limits of distinct vision, as  from C and D. Thus altered, the eye receives them precisely as if they  emanated from a larger arrow placed at C D, which we may suppose to be  ten inches from the eye, and then the difference between the real and  the imaginary arrow is called the magnifying power of the lens in  question.    From what has been said it will be evident that two persons whose eyes  differed as to the distance at which they obtained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by The  Internet Archive)                    Transcriber's note: Corrected obvious punctuation errors (e.g. \" for ')  Accented letters replaced with ['x] for acute accent, [`x] for grave  accent, [^x] for circumflex, [~x] for tilde.

LONDON  LONGMANS, GREEN, AND CO.  AND NEW YORK  1895      [_All rights reserved_]          PREFACE      The \"Cid Campeador\" has been for centuries the great popular hero of  Spain. He takes the same place in that country as King Arthur does in  England, Roland, or Rolando, in France, and William Tell in Switzerland;  and, like them, his life and exploits are, to a great extent, founded on  popular traditions. In English-speaking countries there is very little  known respecting him, and the translator ventures to place before the  public a work which is considered by Spaniards to be one of the best  historical romances in their literature. It is founded on a large number  of ballads and other poetical pieces, extant in Spain for centuries, and  on a very old work named \"The Chronicle of the Cid.\"    The Author writes in his Introduction: \"The Cid is the most popular of  the Castilian heroes, and not without reason, for in him are personified  all the virtues of the citizen and of the soldier. A good son, he  avenges the insults offered to his father by bravely fighting with the  Count of Gormaz: a good cavalier and faithful lover, he gives his hand  and heart to the daughter of the man whom he had slain in fair combat: a  good monarchist, he risks the anger of King Alfonzo by compelling him to  take an oath that he was not guilty of a crime which would stain the  throne of Fernando the Great: a good soldier and a good vassal, he  conquers, with his invincible sword, hostile realms and Moorish kings,  and lays at the feet of his sovereign, who had unjustly banished him,  the spoils which he had won and the countries of which he had made  himself master: a good patrician, loving the glory and the preponderance  of his native land, he proceeds to Rome, enters the Church of St. Peter,  and seeing in the place of honour the seat of the representative of  France, he breaks it in pieces, filled with indignation, and puts in its  place that of the representative of Spain: and finally, a good  Christian, a good husband, and a good father; before entering into the  combats, when calling upon God, he also uses the names of his wife and  children, over whom he had wept when parting from them,--he who, in  battle, showed a heart more hard than the armour which covered it.\"          CONTENTS          CHAP.

Don Fernando I., King of Castile and Leon, had  journeyed to Najera to visit his brother Don Garcia, King of Navarre,  who was sojourning, in bad health, in that town; but, having learned  that Don Garcia desired to take him prisoner, on account of certain  matters which were pending between them, regarding the partition of  their late father's kingdom, he quickly withdrew to a place of safety.  Don Garcia having gone, in his turn, to visit his brother, was  incarcerated in the Castle of Cea. However, having succeeded in escaping  from it, he summoned the Moors to his aid, and entered Castile,  determined on revenge, and committed horrible atrocities. Don Fernando  sallied forth to meet him, engaged with him at Atapuerca, not far from  Burgos, and the invading army was completely routed. Don Garcia was  killed by a lance-wound inflicted on him by a soldier named Sancho  Fortun, who had gone over to the service of Don Fernando.    This, then, was the occasion of the festivities to which we have  alluded, festivities which had attracted to the Court great numbers of  ladies and cavaliers, not alone from Castile and Leon, but also from the  other"]]]
