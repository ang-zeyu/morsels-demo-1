Two States, a Federal agency, a university,  and two private conservation groups pooled their resources to make the  project possible. This effort exemplifies the type of cooperation the  Department of the Interior believes is imperative in beginning the  gigantic task of trying to save and restore the threatened and  endangered animals in this country today.    Our pride is bittersweet, however. The experiment was a complete success  in providing the information sought: What might happen when a pack of  wolves is transplanted to a new area where the native population has  been all but exterminated by Man? It was the answer to this question  that was disappointing. Nevertheless, experiments are for learning, no  matter what the answers may be. We are convinced that the answers  provided by this project will ultimately be most helpful in future  attempts to restore endangered animals to parts of their native ranges  where they can begin again on the road to recovery.

Their movements were  monitored by aerial radio-telemetry.    The wolves separated into a group of three and a single animal after  release. The single, a young female, remained in the release region in  an area of 346 square miles (896 km^{2}). The pack of three moved  generally westward for 13 days and then explored a 1,631 square-mile  (4,224 km^{2}) region but settled after 2 months in a 246 square-mile  (637 km^{2}) area about 55 miles (88 km) southwest of the release site.  The adult female, which mated while captive prior to release, failed to  whelp.    In early July, one male was killed by an automobile, and the other was  shot. The remaining female from the pack then began to move over a much  larger area again. On September 20th she was trapped by a coyote (_Canis  latrans_) trapper and shot. Two months later the single female was  killed by a deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) hunter.    These results indicated that wolves can be transplanted to a new region,  although they may not settle in the release area itself. The  displacement of the translocated wolves in this experiment apparently  caused an initial increase in their daily movements, and probably  increased their vulnerability, at least during the first 2 months after  release. The two females examined post-mortem were in good physical  condition indicating that food supplies were adequate in Michigan.    Human-caused mortality was responsible for the failure of the wolves to  establish themselves. Therefore recommendations for a more successful  re-establishment effort include a stronger public-education campaign,  removal of the coyote bounty, and release of a greater number of  wolves.                                        INTRODUCTION      The eastern timber wolf (_Canis lupus lycaon_) originally occurred  throughout the eastern United States and Canada but is now extinct in  most of the United States. The only substantial population left inhabits  northern Minnesota (Fig. 1). The estimated wolf population in the  Superior National Forest of northeastern Minnesota in winter 1972-73 was  about 390 (Mech 1973), and a tentative population estimate for the  entire state is 500 to 1,000 (Mech and Rausch 1975). A well known  population of about 15 to 30 wolves is also found in Isle Royale  National Park, Lake Superior, Michigan (Mech 1966; Wolfe and Allen 1973;  Peterson 1974).    [Illustration: _Fig. 1.--Original and present range of the Eastern  Timber Wolf_]    In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Hendrickson et al. (1975) estimated  the wolf population in 1973 at 6 to 10 animals, existing in three  scattered areas: Iron County, Northern Marquette County, and Chippewa  and Mackinac Counties (Fig. 2). Lone wolves made up 90 per cent of  verified wolf observations there in recent years, and no more than two  animals have been found together in at least the past 13 years.    Hendrickson et al. (1975) postulated that the current low wolf  population is maintained through possible sporadic breeding and  immigration from Ontario and Minnesota (via Wisconsin), but is  suppressed by illegal shooting and losses incidental to coyote (_Canis  latrans_) bounty trapping.    The eastern timber wolf was classed as an endangered species in the  conterminous United States in 1967 under the Endangered Species Act of  1966. There then followed widespread national and international concern  and support for preserving natural wolf populations. Substantial  scientific and ethical arguments exist for preventing the extinction of  a species or subspecies of any plant or animal. In addition, the  presence of the wolf adds immeasurably to a wilderness experience; its  esthetic value is incalculable.    Thus in 1970, D. W. Douglass, Chief of the Wildlife Division, Michigan  Department of Natural Resources, suggested that restoration of a viable  population of wolves in Michigan would be desirable, especially if such  efforts could be supported by private organizations. In 1973 the Huron  Mountain Wildlife Foundation and the National Audubon Society offered  financial support, and we undertook this pilot project to obtain  information necessary for a full-scale restoration effort.    The objectives of the research project were to determine whether (1)  wild wolves could be moved to a new location, (2) such translocated  wolves could remain in the new area, (3) they could learn to find and  procure enough food in the new area, (4) they could tolerate and survive  human activities, and (5) they would breed and help to re-establish a  new population in Upper Michigan.    As background we had the results of three previous attempts to  transplant wolves to new areas. In 1952, one male and three female zoo  wolves were released on Isle Royale (Mech 1966). They were attracted to  humans, became nuisances, and had to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35013"],[0,"Chopin : The Story of the Boy Who Made Beautiful Melodies (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                                                CHILD'S OWN BOOK                            _of Great Musicians_                                   CHOPIN                                 [Illustration]                                      _By_                               THOMAS TAPPER                              THEODORE PRESSER CO.                            1712 CHESTNUT STREET                               .PHILADELPHIA.

PRESSER CO., Pub's., Phila., Pa.=                                    HOW TO USE THIS BOOK      This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF GREAT  MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of \"Pictures from the Lives  of the Great Composers for Children,\" \"Music Talks with Children,\"  \"First Studies in Music Biography,\" and others.    The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the  child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place  throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as  will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to  cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the  corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around  each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.    After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the  book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the  great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous  pages.    The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the  cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's  own book.    This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting  task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to  the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth  while.                       *       *       *       *       *    This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians includes at  present a book on each of the following:        Bach                    Grieg                   Mozart      Beethoven               Handel                  Nevin      Brahms                  Haydn                   Schubert      Chopin                  Liszt                   Schumann      Dvorak                  MacDowell               Tschaikowsky      Foster                  Mendelssohn             Verdi                                                      Wagner                                     [Illustration: No. 4]                               [Illustration: No. 11]                               [Illustration: No. 2]                               [Illustration: No. 15]                               [Illustration: No. 16]                               [Illustration: No. 17]                               [Illustration: No. 18]                               [Illustration: No. 19]                               [Illustration: No. 1]                               [Illustration: No. 3]                               [Illustration: No. 10]                               [Illustration: No. 13]                               [Illustration: No. 14]                               [Illustration: No. 9]                               [Illustration: No. 12]                               [Illustration: No. 5]                               [Illustration: No. 6]                               [Illustration: No. 7]                               [Illustration: No. 8]                                  Frederic Francois Chopin                            The Story of the Boy Who                          Made Beautiful Melodies                               This Book was made by                             _____________________                                    Philadelphia                            Theodore Presser Co.                             1712 Chestnut Str.

The Story of the Boy who Made Beautiful Melodies    As long as we live and keep in touch with the works of the great  composers we shall love more and more the music of Frederic Francois  Chopin.    It will be pleasant to learn from time to time something about him. We  should like, for example, to know:    In what country he was born.    In what places he lived.    What kinds of music he composed.    Perhaps we may begin by learning that he was born in a little village in  Poland not far from the City of Warsaw, beside which flows the famous  river Vistula. Here is a picture of the house in which Chopin was born.                     [Illustration 2: CHOPIN'S BIRTHPLACE]    Chopin's father, a Frenchman by birth, was a schoolmaster. (So was the  father of Franz Schubert, you remember.) The boy's mother was a native  of Poland. From the time when he was a little boy, the future great  composer loved his mother's country and the people just as much as he  loved the dear mother herself.    The father knew that his little son was musical, so he took the greatest  care to have him taught by the best teachers. He watched over him quite  as Leopold Mozart watched the progress of Wolferl; and as Mendelssohn's  mother guided Felix and Fanny in their first music lessons.    Mendelssohn and Chopin were indeed very nearly the same age. Mendelssohn  was born in February, 1809, and Chopin was born the first of March in  the same year. Let us keep their names together in our memory for the  future.    Mendelssohn died two years before the death of Chopin. Both of these  great composers kept busily at their work until the last year of their  lives although neither of them was very strong.                        [Illustration 3: F. MENDELSSOHN]    Here is a picture of little Chopin playing for a group of boyhood  friends.            [Illustration 4: LITTLE CHOPIN PLAYING FOR HIS FRIENDS]    Chopin was only nine years old when he first played in public. It is  said that he created quite a sensation. But like all those who know that  talent is something to be worked for, he did not stop studying just  because his playing was pleasing to other people. In fact, it was just  on that account that he began to work all the harder.    Then there came a great change. He left his home and went to Paris,  where he lived for the rest of his life. Even though he was but a youth  of twenty-one, he had already composed two concertos for the piano.  These he had played in public to the great delight of all who heard him,  but especially of his countrymen.    You see, Chopin's going to Paris was a strange journey. The boy was  leaving his mother's country and going to the land of his father. Like  Joseph Haydn, who went away at the age of six, Chopin never lived at  home again.    But he did not reach Paris a stranger. The world of music had heard of  him and some of its great ones welcomed his coming.    Let us always think of these men who knew each other well as a family.                            [Illustration 5: LISZT]                           [Illustration 6: BERLIOZ]                          [Illustration 7: MEYERBEER]                            [Illustration 8: HEINE]                            [Illustration 9: CHOPIN]    Liszt was a great pianist.    Berlioz was a famous composer for the orchestra.    Meyerbeer was best known as an operatic composer.    Heine was a great poet whose verses were set to music by many song  composers.    Berlioz was the only one of the group who was born in France.    During his boyhood Chopin played much in public, journeying to some of  the great cities of Europe, among them Vienna, Berlin, and Munich.    Therefore, when he played in Paris it was as an artist. Here, as at  home, he charmed everyone by the beauty of his music and the loveliness  of his touch.    He possessed the true piano hand. It was somewhat narrow. The fingers  were long and tapering. It seemed at once strong and vigorous, yet  delicate and sensitive.                        [Illustration 10: CHOPIN'S HAND]    Indeed, Chopin's music is of just these qualities. It is strong in its  nobility, delicate in its sentiment.    One would think that to arrive in Paris and to be welcomed by the great  ones would make everything easy.    But it was not so for Chopin. Only a few people were present at his  first concert and for quite a while he had no pupils.    Indeed, it was all so discouraging that he made up his mind to return to  his beloved Poland.    His friend, Franz Liszt, begged him not to go. Others, too, urged him to  stay in Paris. One friend, who met him in the street as he was about to  leave, advised him as did the others to stay in Paris.    But no, he was going home.    \"But,\" said this friend, \"first come with me to visit a true lover of  music.\"    So Chopin went with him to the house of Baron Rothschild. Here he  played, so charming"]]]
