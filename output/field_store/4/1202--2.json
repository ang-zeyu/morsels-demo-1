PREFACE      The letters of which these volumes are composed embrace the second  half of journeys in the East extending over a period of two years.[1]  They attempt to be a faithful record of facts and impressions, but  were necessarily written in haste at the conclusion of fatiguing  marches, and often in circumstances of great discomfort and  difficulty, and I relied for their correction in the event of  publication on notes made with much care. Unfortunately I was robbed  of nearly the whole of these, partly on my last journey in Persia and  partly on the Turkish frontier,--a serious loss, which must be my  apology to the reader for errors which, without this misfortune, would  not have occurred.    The bibliography of Persia is a very extensive one, and it may well be  that I have little that is new to communicate, except on a part of  Luristan previously untraversed by Europeans; but each traveller  receives a different impression from those made upon his predecessors,  and I hope that my book may be accepted as an honest attempt to make a  popular contribution to the sum of knowledge of a country and people  with which we are likely to be brought into closer relations.    As these volumes are simply travels in Persia and Eastern Asia Minor,  and are _not a book on either country_, the references to such  subjects as were not within the sphere of my observation are brief and  incidental. The administration of government, the religious and legal  systems, the tenure of land, and the mode of taxation are dismissed in  a few lines, and social customs are only described when I came in  contact with them. The Ilyats, or nomadic tribes, form a very  remarkable element of the population of Persia, but I have only  noticed two of their divisions--the Bakhtiari and Feili Lurs. The  antiquities of Persia are also passed over with hardly a remark, as  well as many other subjects, which have been \"threshed out\" by  previous writers with more or less of accuracy.    I make these omissions with all the more satisfaction, because most  that is \"knowable\" concerning Persia will be accessible on the  publication of a work now in the Press, _Persia and the Persian  Question_, by the Hon. George N. Curzon, M.P., who has not only  travelled extensively in the country, but has bestowed such enormous  labour and research upon it, and has had such exceptional  opportunities of acquiring the latest and best official information,  that his volumes may fairly be described as \"exhaustive.\"    It is always a pleasant duty to acknowledge kindness, and I am deeply  grateful to several friends for the help which they have given me in  many ways, and for the trouble which some of them have taken to  recover facts which were lost with my notes, as well as for the  careful revision of a portion of my letters in MS. I am indebted to  the Indian authorities for the materials for a sketch map, for  photographs from which many of the illustrations are taken, and for  the use of a valuable geographical report, and to Mr. Thistleton Dyer,  Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, for the identification  of a few of my botanical specimens.    In justice to the many kind friends who received me into their homes,  I am anxious to disclaim having either echoed or divulged their views  on Persian or Turkish subjects, and to claim and accept the fullest  responsibility for the opinions expressed in these pages, which,  whether right or wrong, are wholly my own. It is from those who know  Persia and Kurdistan the best that I am sure of receiving the most  kindly allowance wherever, in spite of an honest desire to be  accurate, I have fallen into mistakes.    The retention, not only of the form, but of the reality of diary  letters, is not altogether satisfactory either to author or reader,  for the author sacrifices the literary and artistic arrangement of his  materials, and however ruthlessly omissions are made, the reader is  apt to find himself involved in a multiplicity of minor details,  treated in a fashion which he is inclined to term \"slipshod,\" and to  resent the egotism which persistently clings to familiar  correspondence. Still, even with all the disadvantages of this form of  narrative, I think that letters are the best mode of placing the  reader in the position of the traveller, and of enabling him to share,  not only first impressions in their original vividness, and the  interests and enjoyments of travelling, but the hardships,  difficulties, and tedium which are their frequent accompaniments!    For the lack of vivacity which, to my thinking, pervades the following  letters, I ask the reader's indulgence. They were originally written,  and have since been edited, under the heavy and abiding shadow, not  only of the loss of the beloved and only sister who was the  inspiration of my former books of travel, and to whose completely  sympathetic interest they owed whatever of brightness they possessed,  but of my beloved husband, whose able and careful revision  accompanied my last volume through the Press.    Believing that these letters faithfully reflect what I saw of the  regions of which they treat, I venture to ask for them the same kindly  and lenient criticism with which my travels in the Far East and  elsewhere were received in bygone years, and to express the hope that  they may help to lead towards that goal to which all increase of  knowledge of races and beliefs tends--a truer and kindlier recognition  of the brotherhood of man, as seen in the light of the Fatherhood of  God.

BISHOP.         _November 12, 1891._    FOOTNOTE:    [1] I left England with a definite object in view, to which others  were subservient, but it is not necessary to obtrude it on the reader.

Two days before we left Chigakhor fierce heat set in, with a blue heat  haze. Since then the mercury has reached 98 deg. in the shade. The call to  \"Boot and Saddle\" is at 3.45. Black flies, sand-flies, mosquitos,  scorpions, and venomous spiders abound. There is no hope of change or  clouds or showers until the autumn. Greenery is fast scorching up.  \"The heaven above is as brass, and the earth beneath is as iron.\" The  sky is a merciless steely blue. The earth radiates heat far on into  the night. \"Man goeth forth to his work,\" not \"till the evening,\" but  in the evening. The Ilyats, with their great brown flocks, march all  night. The pools are dry, and the lesser streams have disappeared. The  wheat on the rain-lands is scorched before the ears are full, and when  the stalks are only six inches long. This is a normal Persian summer  in Lat. 32 deg. N. The only way of fighting this heat is never to yield to  it, to plod on persistently, and never have an idle moment, but I do  often long for an Edinburgh east wind, for drifting clouds and rain,  and even for a chilly London fog! This same country is said to be  buried under seven or eight feet of snow in winter.    On leaving Chigakhor we crossed a low hill into the Seligun valley, so  fair and solitary a month ago, now brown and dusty, and swarming with  Ilyats and their flocks, and Lake Albolaki has shrunk into something  little better than a swamp. A path at a great elevation above a stream  and a short rocky ascent brought us to the top of the pass above  Naghun, a wall of rock, with an altitude of 7320 feet, and a very  stiff zigzag descent upon Isfandyar Khan's garden, where the heat made  a long halt necessary. The view from the Naghun Pass of the great  Ardal valley is a striking one, though not so striking as one would  suppose from the altitude of the mountains, which, however, do not  nearly reach the limit of perpetual snow, though the Kuh-i-Kaller, the  Kuh-i-Sabz, the great mass of the Kuh-i-Gerra, the range of the  Kuh-i-Dinar, and the Kuh-i-Zirreh are all from 11,000 to 13,000 feet  in height. Even on the north side the range which we crossed by the  Gardan-i-Zirreh exceeds 9000 feet. The Karun, especially where it  escapes from the Ardal valley by the great Tang-i-Ardal, is a grand  feature of the landscape from the Naghun Pass.    On leaving Naghun we were joined by Aziz Khan, a petty chief, a  retainer of Isfandyar Khan, who has been deputed to attend on the  Agha, and who may be useful in various ways.    Between Naghun and Ardal, in an elevated ravine, a species of  _aristolochia_, which might well be mistaken for a pitcher-plant, was  growing abundantly, and on the Ardal plain the \"sweet sultan\" and the  _Ferula glauca_ have taken the place of the _Centaurea alata_, which  is all cut and stacked.    A hot and tedious march over the Ardal plateau, no longer green, and  eaten up by the passage of Ilyat flocks, brought us to the village of  Ardal, now deserted and melancholy, the great ibex horns which  decorate the roof of the Ilkhani's barrack giving it a spectral look  in its loneliness. The night was hot, and the perpetual passing of  Ilyats, with much braying and bleating, and a stampede of mules  breaking my tent ropes, forbade sleep. It was hot when we started the  next morning, still following up the Ardal valley and the Karun to  Kaj, a village on bare hummocks of gravel alongside of the Karun, a  most unpromising-looking place, but higher up in a lateral valley  there was a spring and a walled orchard, full of luxuriant greenery,  where we camped under difficulties, for the only entrance was by a  little stream, leading to a low hole with a door of stone, such as the  Afghans use for security, and through which the baggage could not be  carried. The tents had to be thrown over the wall. There was little  peace, for numbers of the Kaj men sat in rows steadily staring, and  there were crowds of people for medicine, ushered in by the  _ketchuda_.    Four miles above Ardal is a most picturesque scene, which, though I  had ridden to it before, I appreciated far more on a second visit.  This is the magnificent gorge of the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash, a  gigantic gash or rift in the great range which bounds the Ardal and  Kaj valleys on the north, and through which the river, on whose  lawn-like margin the camps were pitched at Shamsabad, find its way to  the Karun. A stone bridge of a single arch of wide span is thrown  across the stream at its exit from the mountains. Above the bridge are  great masses of naked rock, rising into tremendous precipices above  the compressed water, with roses and vines hanging out of their  clefts.    Below, the river suddenly expands, and there is a small village, now  deserted, with orchards and wheatfields in the depression in which the  Darkash Warkash finds its way across the Kaj valley, a region so  sheltered from the fierce sweep of the east wind, and so desirable in  other respects, that it bears the name of Bihishtabad, the _Mansion of  Heaven_.    Geographically this _tang_ has a great interest, for the water passing  under the bridge is the united volume of the water system to which  three out of the four districts known as the Chahar Mahals owe their  fertility, and represents the drainage of 2500 square miles. It will  be remembered that we entered the Chahar Mahals by the Kahva Rukh  Pass, and crossed that portion of them lying between Kahva Rukh and  the Zirreh Pass, which is politically, not geographically, a portion  of the Bakhtiari country, and is partially Christian.    I started at five the next morning to follow the left bank of the  Karun for nearly a whole march, sometimes riding close beside it among  barley-fields, then rising to a considerable height above it. It is  occasionally much compressed between walls of conglomerate, and boils  along furiously, but even where it is stillest and broadest, it is  always deep, full, and unfordable, bridged over, however, at a place  where there are several mills. An ascent from it leads to the village  of Rustam-i, where the people were very courteous and put me on the  road to Ali-kuh, a village not far from the river, at the foot of a  high range very much gashed by its affluents, one of which is very  salt.    Ali-kuh is quite deserted, and every hovel door is open. There is  nothing to tempt cupidity. The people, when they migrate to the high  pastures, take all their goods with them. There was not a creature  left behind who could tell me of a spring, and it was a tiresome  search before I came, high upon the hillside, on a stream tumbling  down under willows over red rock, in a maze of campanulas and roses.  The first essential of a camping-ground is that there should be space  to camp, and this is lacking; my servants sleep in the open, and my  bed and chair are propped up by stones on the steep slope. Scorpions,  \"processional\" caterpillars, earwigs, and flies abound. It is very  pretty, but very uncomfortable. The stream is noisy, and a rude flour  mill above has the power, which it has exercised, of turning it into  another channel for irrigation purposes. There are some large Ilyat  camps above, and from these and from Rustam-i the people have been  crowding in.    The wild flowers about Ali-kuh are in great profusion just now, the  most showy being hollyhocks--white, pink, and mauve, which affect the  cultivated lands. Three parasitic plants are also abundant, one of  them being the familiar dodder."]]]
