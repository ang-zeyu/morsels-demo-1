KIMBALL,    AN APOSTLE;    THE FATHER AND FOUNDER OF THE BRITISH MISSION.    ----    BY ORSON F. WHITNEY.    ----    It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy  in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who, in the  midst of the crowd, keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of  his character.--_Emerson_.    ----    PUBLISHED BY THE KIMBALL FAMILY,    SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.      PRINTED AT THE JUVENILE INSTRUCTOR OFFICE.    1888.            TO THE MEMORY OF    My GRANDFATHER;    AND TO THE GREAT    Cause of Truth,    _For which he lived and died; and to all who love that    Memory and that Cause,    This Volume is reverently Dedicated by_    THE AUTHOR.          PREFACE.      In presenting this work to the public, I not only fulfill the desires  of my own heart and those of my kindred who have undertaken to publish  what is here written and compiled, but likewise, I am persuaded, the  wish of our departed ancestor. Laying the foundation for such a work  while living (as the copious selections from his own writings will  testify), he left its bringing forth as a sacred legacy to his  posterity.    For many years this duty, unenjoined in words, but accepted by all in  the light of a behest, was permitted to lie dormant. The death of  President Kimball, on the 22nd of June, 1868, was a calamity so sudden  and heavy in its effect upon his family, as to almost paralyze thought  and effort. Though trained to independence and self-reliance, under  his wise government, and never pampered in ease and luxury, they had  ever looked to him for guidance and support, and had never known the  weight of responsibility resting upon him as their parent and  provider, only as from time to time he had taken certain ones into his  confidence and permitted them to share his burdens.    In his absence they were as sheep that had lost their shepherd. \"Who  will provide for us now, and what shall we do to earn a livelihood?\"  Such were the thoughts presented to their minds, and the questions  asked of their secret souls, as they looked around upon their temporal  situation. The division of the parental estate had left them  comfortable, though far from rich, None of his sons had trades, but  all had been brought up to work. Realizing that a city life was no  longer their lot, they resolved to separate, and, following the  example of their ancestors for generations, go forth and colonize new  regions. Some moved north, and others south, but few remaining in the  city of their birth, and at the expiration of fifteen years, many had  become almost as strangers to each other.    About the year 1883 a spirit of inquiry commenced to manifest itself  among the members of the Kimball family, causing them to \"feel after\"  and evince more interest in each other's welfare. This sentiment  increasing, some of the elder members at length opened a  correspondence on the subject of a family reunion. By many this was  deemed impracticable, owing to their scattered condition; some living  in Idaho, some in southern Arizona, and others in California; and  nearly all in circumstances which, it was thought, would hardly  justify the necessary outlay. But the desire to meet and mingle with  each other finally grew so urgent and so general among them--as though  some unseen power were at work in their midst, with this object in  view--that it was determined to hold the reunion, no matter what  sacrifice it entailed.    During the summer of 1886, a number of the family met and appointed a  Committee on Reunion, selecting for the day, June 14th, 1887, (the  eighty-sixth anniversary of their father's birth) and as the place of  meeting, Fuller's Hill Gardens, Salt Lake City. There came together on  that memorable occasion, fully three hundred members and relatives of  the Kimball family, with others who had been invited to take part in  the celebration. A programme, previously arranged, consisting of  speeches, recitations, readings, vocal and instrumental music, etc.,  was carried out to the satisfaction and enjoyment of all, and the  remainder of the time spent in amusement, festivity and recreation. A  spirit of peace and union, powerful and indescribable, pervaded the  assembly and permeated the whole occasion, causing every heart to  swell with love, and many an eye to glisten with tears of gratitude  and joy. As though, indeed, the spirits of the departed were there,  bringing with them the sweet influences of the celestial world, to  weld anew, as links of a broken chain, the souls of those so long  separated. It was, in truth, a day never to be forgotten.    There were present, of the family of President Kimball, nineteen sons,  six daughters, and several of his widows, besides grand-children, and  many other relatives, near and remote.    One of the features of the programme was a sketch of the life of Heber  C. Kimball, written for the occasion and read by his grandson, the  author of this work. This incident determined and united the family on  a project mooted by its members and partly executed several years  before. It was the publication of the life of Heber C. Kimball. On the  evening of the day of reunion the male members of the family met and  appointed a committee of five on publication. Several thousand dollars  of undivided property, still in the estate, was devoted to the  purpose, and the author hereof solicited, and by unanimous voice  chosen and engaged to write the history.    Such, in brief, were the immediate causes of the coming forth of this  volume.    In the execution of my task, I have felt strongly moved upon by the  spirit of my grandsire, and verily believe that his presence, though  unseen, has hovered near me.    This book is written from the standpoint of a Latter-day Saint. It  makes no apology for the honest expression of views, which, however  false or fanatical they may seem to others, are in the opinion of the  author only such as ought to be entertained by every sincere believer  and defender of the faith. It is issued with the humble and earnest  hope that it may go forth as a messenger of Truth to help prepare the  way for greater things that shall glorify God and redeem Zion. The  life of a man like Heber C. Kimball, with its lessons of faith and  humility, of virtue, courage and devotion, cannot fail, if prayerfully  read, to do something in this direction.    Wherever possible, I have allowed the subject to speak for himself. In  lieu of converting facts found of record in his Journal into \"original  matter,\" I have presented them mostly in all their freshness and  simplicity; as flowers of the field, with the dew and fragrance of  their native meadow yet clinging to them. This has been done, not only  out of deference to the wishes of his relatives, who desired that much  of what their father had written should be incorporated in the book of  his life, but because I have deemed it best to thus project upon the  reader's mental vision, by means of the most superior process, the  portrait of the man and his mission as painted by himself.    I cannot close this introductory without expressing my deep sense of  indebtedness to the kind friends who have aided and encouraged me in  the bringing forth of this, my first book. Their name is legion, but  limited space will only permit the mention of a few. To President  Wilford Woodruff and others of the Apostles I am indebted for kind  words and encouragement, and for the appointment of a committee, at my  request, to read the manuscript and pass upon it critically, as to  doctrinal and historical points, before placing it in the hands of the  printer; to Elder George Reynolds, for his intelligent advice and  labors as one of said committee; and to Edward W. Tullidge Esq., the  veteran author, for a collection of facts relating to my subject,  gathered during his extensive experience as historian and biographer.  Last, but not least, in this limited reference, I am under obligations  of gratitude to my uncle, Solomon F. Kimball, the chief promoter of  this work, who first approached me on the subject of writing his  father's life, and who, in all the toils incident to such an  undertaking, has proved my staunch and faithful friend.    My labor, I need hardly say, in conclusion, has been one of love and  duty. I have fulfilled, imperfectly I know, conscientiously I am as  certain, what I considered a sacred trust; the result of which I now  lay at the feet of an indulgent public.

The Author embarked in the fleet which sailed to found the establishment at  Botany Bay. He shortly after published a Narrative of the Proceedings and  State of the Colony, brought up to the beginning of July, 1788, which  was well received, and passed through three editions. This could not  but inspire both confidence and gratitude; but gratitude, would be badly  manifested were he on the presumption of former favour to lay claim  to present indulgence. He resumes the subject in the humble hope of  communicating information, and increasing knowledge, of the country, which  he describes.    He resided at Port Jackson nearly four years: from the 20th of January,  1788, until the 18th of December, 1791. To an active and contemplative  mind, a new country is an inexhaustible source of curiosity and  speculation. It was the author's custom not only to note daily occurrences,  and to inspect and record the progression of improvement; but also, when  not prevented by military duties, to penetrate the surrounding country in  different directions, in order to examine its nature, and ascertain its  relative geographical situations.    The greatest part of the work is inevitably composed of those materials  which a journal supplies; but wherever reflections could be introduced  without fastidiousness and parade, he has not scrupled to indulge them, in  common with every other deviation which the strictness of narrative would  allow.    When this publication was nearly ready for the press; and when many of  the opinions which it records had been declared, fresh accounts from Port  Jackson were received. To the state of a country, where so many anxious  trying hours of his life have passed, the author cannot feel indifferent.  If by any sudden revolution of the laws of nature; or by any fortunate  discovery of those on the spot, it has really become that fertile and  prosperous land, which some represent it to be, he begs permission to add  his voice to the general congratulation. He rejoices at its success: but  it is only justice to himself and those with whom he acted to declare, that  they feel no cause of reproach that so complete and happy an alteration did  not take place at an earlier period.            CHAPTER I.        A Retrospect of the State of the Colony of Port Jackson, on the Date of my  former Narrative, in July, 1788.      Previous to commencing any farther account of the subject, which I am about  to treat, such a retrospection of the circumstances and situation of the  settlement, at the conclusion of my former Narrative, as shall lay its  state before the reader, seems necessary, in order to connect the present  with the past.    The departure of the first fleet of ships for Europe, on the 14th of July,  1788, had been long impatiently expected; and had filled us with anxiety,  to communicate to our friends an account of our situation; describing the  progress of improvement, and the probability of success, or failure, in  our enterprise. That men should judge very oppositely on so doubtful and  precarious an event, will hardly surprise.    Such relations could contain little besides the sanguineness of hope, and  the enumeration of hardships and difficulties, which former accounts had  not led us to expect. Since our disembarkation in the preceding January,  the efforts of every one had been unremittingly exerted, to deposit the  public stores in a state of shelter and security, and to erect habitations  for ourselves. We were eager to escape from tents, where a fold of canvas,  only, interposed to check the vertic beams of the sun in summer, and the  chilling blasts of the south in winter. A markee pitched, in our finest  season, on an English lawn; or a transient view of those gay camps, near  the metropolis, which so many remember, naturally draws forth careless and  unmeaning exclamations of rapture, which attach ideas of pleasure only, to  this part of a soldier's life. But an encampment amidst the rocks and wilds  of a new country, aggravated by the miseries of bad diet, and incessant  toil, will find few admirers.    Nor were our exertions less unsuccessful than they were laborious. Under  wretched covers of thatch lay our provisions and stores, exposed to  destruction from every flash of lightning, and every spark of fire. A few  of the convicts had got into huts; but almost all the officers, and the  whole of the soldiery, were still in tents.    In such a situation, where knowledge of the mechanic arts afforded the  surest recommendation to notice, it may be easily conceived, that attention  to the parade duty of the troops, gradually diminished. Now were to be  seen officers and soldiers not \"trailing the puissant pike\" but felling the  ponderous gum-tree, or breaking the stubborn clod. And though \"the broad  falchion did not in a ploughshare end\" the possession of a spade, a  wheelbarrow, or a dunghill, was more coveted than the most refulgent arms  in which heroism ever dazzled. Those hours, which in other countries are  devoted to martial acquirements, were here consumed in the labours of the  sawpit, the forge and the quarry*.      [* \"The Swedish prisoners, taken at the battle of Pultowa, were transported  by the Czar Peter to the most remote parts of Siberia, with a view to  civilize the natives of the country, and teach them the arts the Swedes  possessed. In this hopeless situation, all traces of discipline and  subordination, between the different ranks, were quickly obliterated. The  soldiers, who were husbandmen and artificers, found out their superiority,  and assumed it: the officers became their servants.\" VOLTAIRE.]      Of the two ships of war, the 'Sirius' and 'Supply', the latter was  incessantly employed in transporting troops, convicts, and stores, to  Norfolk Island; and the 'Sirius' in preparing for a voyage to some port,  where provisions for our use might be purchased, the expected supply from  England not having arrived. It is but justice to the officers and men of  both these ships to add, that, on all occasions, they fully shared every  hardship and fatigue with those on shore.    On the convicts the burden fell yet heavier: necessity compelled us to  allot to them the most slavish and laborious employments. Those operations,  which in other countries are performed by the brute creation, were here  effected by the exertions of men: but this ought not to be considered  a grievance; because they had always been taught to expect it, as the  inevitable consequence of their offences against society. Severity was  rarely exercised on them; and justice was administered without partiality  or discrimination. Their ration of provisions, except in being debarred  from an allowance of spirits, was equal to that which the marines received.  Under these circumstances I record with pleasure, that they behaved better  than had been predicted of them--to have expected sudden and complete  reformation of conduct, were romantic and chimerical.    Our cultivation of the land was yet in its infancy. We had hitherto tried  only the country contiguous to Sydney. Here the governor had established  a government-farm; at the head of which a competent person of his own  household was placed, with convicts to work under him. Almost the whole of  the officers likewise accepted of small tracts of ground, for the purpose  of raising grain and vegetables: but experience proved to us, that the soil  would produce neither without manure; and as this was not to be procured,  our vigour soon slackened; and most of the farms (among which was the one  belonging to government) were successively abandoned.    With the natives we were very little more acquainted than on our arrival  in the country. Our intercourse with them was neither frequent or cordial.  They seemed studiously to avoid us, either from fear, jealousy, or hatred.  When they met with unarmed stragglers, they sometimes killed, and sometimes  wounded them. I confess that, in common with many others, I was inclined  to attribute this conduct, to a spirit of malignant levity. But a farther  acquaintance with them, founded on several instances of their humanity and  generosity, which shall be noticed in their proper places, has entirely  reversed my opinion; and led me to conclude, that the unprovoked outrages  committed upon them, by unprincipled individuals among us, caused the  evils we had experienced. To prevent them from being plundered of their  fishing-tackle and weapons of war, a proclamation was issued, forbidding  their sale among us; but it was not attended with the good effect which was  hoped for from it.    During this period, notwithstanding the want of fresh provisions and  vegetables, and almost constant exposure to the vicissitudes of a variable  climate, disease rarely attacked us; and the number of deaths, was too  inconsiderable to deserve mention.    Norfolk Island had been taken possession of, by a party detached for that  purpose, early after our arrival. Few accounts of it had yet reached us.  And here I beg leave to observe, that as I can speak of this island only  from the relations of others, never having myself been there, I shall in  every part of this work mention it as sparingly as possible. And this more  especially, as it seems probable, that some of those gentlemen, who from  accurate knowledge, and long residence on it, are qualified to write its  history, will oblige the world with such a publication.
