Since the inception of this project by the U. S. Army Corps of  Engineers much argument has arisen as to the values of the dam and  reservoir as opposed to the values of farmland and cultural  establishments to be inundated (Schoewe, 1953; Monfort, 1956; and Van  Orman, 1956). Also, there has been some concern about the possible  effects of impoundment on the fish-resources of the area, which  supports \"a catfish fishery that is notable throughout most of the  State of Kansas and in some neighboring states (U. S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, 1953:9).\" The objectives of my study, conducted from  March 30, 1957, to August 9, 1958, were to record the species of fish  present and their relative abundance in the stream system, and to  obtain a measure of angler success prior to closure of the dam. These  data may be used as a basis for future studies on the fish and fishing  in the Big Blue River Basin, Kansas.          ACKNOWLEDGMENTS      I thank Messrs. J. E. Deacon, D. A. Distler, Wallace Ferrel, D. L.  Hoyt, F. E. Maendele, C. O. Minckley, B. C. Nelson, and J. C. Tash for  assistance in the field and for valuable suggestions. Dr. J. B. Elder,  Kansas State College, arranged for loan of specimens, and Mr. B. C.  Nelson supplied data on _Notropis deliciosus_ (Girard) in Kansas, and  on specimens in the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology.    I thank the many landowners who allowed me access to streams in the  Big Blue River Basin. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City  District, also allowed access in the reservoir area, and furnished  information and some photographs. Mr. J. C. Tash did chemical  determinations on my water samples.    Dr. Frank B. Cross guided me in this study and in preparation of this  report. Drs. E. Raymond Hall and K. B. Armitage offered valuable  suggestions on the manuscript. Equipment and funds for my study were  furnished by the State Biological Survey of Kansas, and the Kansas  Forestry, Fish and Game Commission granted necessary permits.          TUTTLE CREEK DAM AND RESERVOIR      The data on Tuttle Creek Dam and Reservoir that follow were furnished  by Mr. Donald D. Poole, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City  District. The dam, an earth-fill structure, will be 7,500 feet in  length, with a maximum height of 157 feet above the valley floor.  Release of water will be from beneath the west end of the dam, through  two tunnels 20 feet in diameter that have a capacity of 45,000 cubic  feet per second; however, releases exceeding 25,000 c. f. s. are not  planned. The gated spillway is located at the east end of the dam.  Freeboard will be 23 feet at the top of flood-control pool.    The reservoir will have a maximum pool of 2,280,000 acre-feet  capacity, a 53,500-acre surface area, and 368 miles of shoreline. The  present operational plan provides for a conservation pool having a  surface area of 15,700 acres, a shoreline of 112 miles, and a length  of 20 miles.          BIG BLUE RIVER BASIN      Big Blue River and its tributaries, a sub-basin of the Kansas River  System, drain approximately 9,600 square miles, of which 2,484 miles  are in Kansas (Colby, _et al._, 1956:44). The headwaters of the Big  Blue River are in central Hamilton County, Nebraska, near the Platte  River (Fig. 1). The stream flows generally south and east for 283  miles to its confluence with the Kansas River near Manhattan, Kansas.  Little Blue River, the largest tributary to the Big Blue, rises in  eastern Kearney and western Adams counties, Nebraska, and flows  southeast for 208 miles to join the Big Blue near Blue Rapids, Kansas  (Nebraska State Planning Board, 1936:628). The Big Blue River Basin  varies in width from 129 miles in the northwest, to approximately ten  miles near the mouth (Colby, _et al._, 1956:44).          GEOLOGY OF THE BASIN      In Kansas, outcrops of Pennsylvanian and Cretaceous age occur along  the extreme eastern and western sides of the Big Blue River Basin,  respectively, whereas Permian beds (overlain by Pleistocene deposits)  occur throughout most of the remainder of the watershed (see Moore and  Landes, 1937). The Big Blue and Little Blue rivers and their  tributaries have deeply incised the Permian beds of the Flint Hills in  Kansas, exposing limestones and shales of the Admire, Council Grove,  Chase, and Sumner groups (Wolfcampian and Leonardian series) (Walters,  1954:41-44). Pleistocene deposits in the Big Blue Basin in Kansas  consist of alluvium, glacial till, and glacial outwash from the Kansan  glacial stage, overlain by loess deposits of Wisconsin and Recent  stages (Frye and Leonard, 1952: pl. 1).       [Illustration: FIG. 1. Big Blue River Basin, Kansas and Nebraska.]    The Big Blue River was formed \"in part on the till plain surface and  in part by integration of spillway channels,\" in the latter portion of  the Kansan glaciation (Frye and Leonard, 1952:192). This stream, and  the Republican River to the west, carried waters from the areas that  are now the Platte, Niobrara, and upper Missouri River basins (Lugn,  1935:153). Drainage was southward, through Oklahoma, until  establishment of the east-flowing Kansas River (Frye and Leonard,  1952:189-190). As Kansan ice receded the Blue and Republican rivers  retained what is now the Platte River Basin. The lower Platte River  developed and the surface drainage became distinct in the Iowan  (Tazwellian) portion of the Wisconsin glacial stage (Lugn,  1935:152-153). However, according to Lugn (1935:203) the Platte River  Basin contributes about 300,000 acre-feet of water per year to the Big  Blue and Republican rivers by percolation through sands and gravels  underlying the uplands that now separate the basins.          CLIMATE, POPULATION, AND LAND-USE      Climate of the Big Blue River Basin is of the subhumid continental  type, with an average annual precipitation of 22 inches in the  northwest and 30 inches in the southeast. The mean annual evaporation  from water surfaces exceeds annual precipitation by approximately 30  inches (Colby, _et al._, 1956:32-33).    The average annual temperature for the basin is 53 deg. F. (Flora,  1948:148). According to Kincer (1941:704-705) the average temperature  in July, the warmest month, is 78 deg. F., and the coolest month, January,  averages 28 deg. F. Periods of extreme cold and heat are sometimes of long  duration. Length of the growing season varies from less than 160 days  in the northwest to 180 days in the southeast (Kincer, _loc. cit._).    The human population of the Big Blue Basin varies from about 90  persons per square mile in one Nebraska county in the northwest and  one Kansas county in the southeast, to as few as six persons per  square mile in some northeastern counties. The population is most  dense along the eastern border of the basin, decreasing toward the  west. This decrease in population is correlated with the decrease in  average annual precipitation from east to west (Colby, _et al._,  1956:80).    The principal land-use in the Big Blue Watershed is tilled crops, with  wheat, sorghums, and corn being most important. Beef cattle are  important in some portions of the basin. Colby, _et al._ (1956:24)  reported that in 1954 as much as 55 per cent of the land in some  counties near the mouth of the Big Blue River was in pasture. Only one  Nebraska county had less than 15 per cent in pastureland.          PHYSICAL FEATURES OF STREAMS      Streams of the Big Blue River Basin are of three kinds: turbid,  sandy-bottomed streams, usually 150 to 300 feet in width; relatively  clear, mud-bottomed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3775"],[0,"Napoleon Bonaparte (#1)"],[1,"BONAPARTE    BY JOHN S.C. ABBOTT.          Napoleon, finding his proffers of peace rejected by England with  contumely and scorn, and declined by Austria, now prepared, with  his wonted energy, to repel the assaults of the allies. As he sat  in his cabinet at the Tuileries, the thunders of their unrelenting  onset came rolling in upon his ear from all the frontiers of  France. The hostile fleets of England swept the channel, utterly  annihilating the commerce of the Republic, landing regiments  of armed emigrants upon her coast, furnishing money and munitions  of war to rouse the partisans of the Bourbons to civil conflict,  and throwing balls and shells into every unprotected town. On the  northern frontier, Marshal Kray, came thundering down, through the  black Forest, to the banks of the Rhine, with a mighty host of  150,000 men, like locust legions, to pour into all the northern  provinces of France. Artillery of the heaviest calibre and a  magnificent array of cavalry accompanied this apparently invincible  army. In Italy, Melas, another Austrian marshal, with 140,000 men,  aided by the whole force of the British navy, was rushing upon the  eastern and southern borders of the Republic. The French troops,  disheartened by defeat, had fled before their foes over the Alps,  or were eating their horses and their boots in the cities where  they were besieged. From almost every promontory on the coast of  the Republic, washed by the Channel, or the Mediterranean, the eye  could discern English frigates, black and threatening, holding all  France in a state of blockade.    One always finds a certain pleasure in doing that which he can do  well. Napoleon was fully conscious of his military genius. He had,  in behalf of bleeding humanity, implored peace in vain. He now,  with alacrity and with joy, roused himself to inflict blows that  should be felt upon his multitudinous enemies. With such tremendous  energy did he do this, that he received from his antagonists the  most complimentary sobriquet of the one hundred thousand men .  Wherever Napoleon made his appearance in the field, his presence  alone was considered equivalent to that force.    The following proclamation rang like a trumpet charge over the  hills and valleys of France. \"Frenchmen! You have been anxious for  peace. Your government has desired it with still greater ardor.  Its first efforts, its most constant wishes, have been for its  attainment. The English ministry has exposed the secret of its  iniquitous policy. It wishes to dismember France, to destroy its  commerce, and either to erase it from the map of Europe, or to  degrade it to a secondary power. England is willing to embroil all  the nations of the Continent in hostility with each other, that she  may enrich herself with their spoils, and gain possession of the  trade of the world. For the attainment of this object she scatters  her gold, becomes prodigal of her promises, and multiplies her  intrigues.\"    At this call all the martial spirit of France rushed to arms.  Napoleon, supremely devoted to the welfare of the State, seemed to  forget even his own glory in the intensity of his desire to make  France victorious over her foes. With the most magnanimous superiority  to all feelings of jealousy, he raised an army of 150,000 men,  the very elite of the troops of France, the veterans of a hundred  battles, and placed them in the hands of Moreau, the only man in  France who could be called his rival. Napoleon also presented to  Moreau the plan of a campaign in accordance with his own energy,  boldness, and genius. Its accomplishment would have added surpassing  brilliance to the reputation of Moreau. But the cautious general  was afraid to adopt it, and presented another, perhaps as safe, but  one which would produce no dazzling impression upon the imaginations  of men. \"Your plan,\" said one, a friend of Moreau, to the First  Consul, \"is grander, more decisive, even more sure. But it is not  adapted to the slow and cautious genius of the man who is to execute  it. You have your method of making war, which is superior to all  others. Moreau has his own, inferior certainly, but still excellent.  Leave him to himself. If you impose your ideas upon him, you will  wound his self-love, and disconcert him.\"    Napoleon, profoundly versed in the knowledge of the human heart,  promptly replied. \"You are right, Moreau is not capable of grasping  the plan which I have conceived. Let him follow his own course. The  plan which he does not understand and dare not execute, I myself  will carry out, on another part of the theatre of war. What he fears  to attempt on the Rhine, I will accomplish on the Alps. The day may  come when he will regret the glory which he yields to me.\" These  were proud and prophetic words. Moreau, was moderately victorious  upon the Rhine, driving back the invaders. The sun of Napoleon soon  rose, over the field of Marengo, in a blaze of effulgence, which  paled Moreau's twinkling star into utter obscurity. But we know  not where, upon the page of history, to find an act of more lofty  generosity than this surrender of the noblest army of the Republic  to one, who considered himself, and who was deemed by others,  a rival--and thus to throw open to him the theatre of war where  apparently the richest laurels were to be won. And he know where  to look for a deed more proudly expressive of self-confidence.  \"I will give Moreau,\" said he by this act, \"one hundred and fifty  thousand of the most brave and disciplined soldiers of France, the  victors of a hundred battles. I myself will take sixty thousand  men, new recruits and the fragments of regiments which remain, and  with them I will march to encounter an equally powerful enemy on  a more difficult field of warfare.\"    Marshal Melas had spread his vast host of one hundred and forty  thousand Austrians through all the strongholds of Italy, and was  pressing, with tremendous energy and self-confidence upon the frontiers  of France. Napoleon, instead of marching with his inexperienced  troops, two-thirds of whom had never seen a shot fired in earnest,  to meet the heads of the triumphant columns of Melas, resolved  to climb the rugged and apparently inaccessible fastnesses of the  Alps, and, descending from the clouds over path-less precipices,  to fall with the sweep of the avalanche, upon their rear. It was  necessary to assemble this army at some favorable point;--to gather  in vast magazines its munitions of war. It was necessary that  this should be done in secret, lest the Austrians, climbing to the  summits of the Alps, and defending the gorges through which the  troops of Napoleon would be compelled to wind their difficult and  tortuous way, might render the passage utterly impossible. English  and Austrian spies were prompt to communicate to the hostile powers  every movement of the First Consul. Napoleon fixed upon Dijon and  its vicinity as the rendezvous of his troops. He, however, adroitly  and completely deceived his foes by ostentatiously announcing the  very plan he intended to carry into operation.    Of course, the allies thought that this was a foolish attempt  to draw their attention from the real point of attack. The more  they ridiculed the imaginary army at Dijon, the more loudly did  Napoleon reiterate his commands for battalions and magazines to be  collected there. The spies who visited Dijon, reported that but a  few regiments were assembled in that place, and that the announcement  was clearly a very weak pretense to deceive. The print shops of  London and Vienna were filled with caricatures of the army of the  First Consul of Dijon. The English especially made themselves very  merry with Napolcon's grand army to scale the Alps. It was believed  that the energies the Republic were utterly exhausted in raising the  force which was given to Moreau. One of the caricatures represented  the army as consisting of a boy, dressed in his father's clothes,  shouldering a musket, which he could with difficulty lift, and  eating a piece of gingerbread, and an old man with one arm and a  wooden leg. The artillery consisted of a rusty blunderbuss. This  derision was just what Napoleon desired. Though dwelling in the  shadow of that mysterious melancholy, which ever enveloped his  spirit, he must have enjoyed in the deep recesses of his soul, the  majestic movements of his plans.    On the eastern frontiers of France there surge up, from luxuriant  meadows and vine-clad fields and hill sides, the majestic ranges of  the Alps, piercing the clouds and soaring with glittering pinnacles,  into the region of perpetual ice and snow. Vast spurs of the mountains  extend on each side, opening gloomy gorges and frightful detiles,  through which foaming torrents rush impetuously, walled in by  almost precipitous cliffs, whose summits, crowned with melancholy  firs, are inaccessible to the foot of man. The principal pass over  this enormous ridge was that of the Great St. Bernard. The traveler,  accompanied by a guide, and mounted on a mule, slowly and painfully  ascended a steep and rugged path, now crossing a narrow bridge,  spanning a fathomless abyss, again creeping along the edge of a  precipice, where the eagle soared and screamed over the fir tops  in the abyss below, and where a perpendicular wall rose to giddy  heights in the clouds above. The path at times was so narrow,  that it seemed that the mountain goat could with difficulty find a  foothold for its slender hoof. A false step, or a slip upon the icy  rocks would precipitate the traveler, a mangled corpse, a thousand  feet upon the fragments of granite in the gulf beneath. As higher  and higher he climbed these wild and rugged and cloud-enveloped  paths, borne by the unerring instinct of the faithful mule, his  steps were often arrested by the roar of the avalanche and he gazed  appalled upon its resistless rush, as rocks, and trees, and earth,  and"]]]
