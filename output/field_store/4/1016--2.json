Somehow Spot grew up  faster than Johnnie. He had stopped being a puppy by the time his young  master learned to walk. And when Johnnie was big enough to play around  the farm buildings his parents felt sure that he was safe so long as  \"old Spot,\" as they called the dog, was with him.    Spot thought himself years older than the small boy; or at least he  always acted so. If a goose hissed at little, toddling Johnnie Green,  old Spot would drive the goose away, barking in a loud voice, \"Don't you  frighten this child!\" If Johnnie went into the stable and wandered  within reach of the horses' heels Spot would take hold of his clothes  and draw him gently back out of danger. And if Johnnie strayed to the  duck pond the old dog wouldn't leave him even to chase the cat, but  stayed right there by the pond, ready to pull his young charge out of  the water in case he happened to fall in.    Spot seemed to enjoy his task of taking care of Johnnie Green. It wasn't  all work. A great deal of pleasure went with his duties, for Johnnie  Green never wanted to do anything but play. And Spot wasn't so grown up  that he couldn't enjoy a lively romp. For that matter, he never did get  over his liking for boisterous fun.    Still, there were some kinds of sport that he didn't care for. He wasn't  fond of having such things as tin cans tied to his tail. He disliked to  be harnessed to a toy wagon. He hated to have his ears pulled. Yet there  was only one offense that ever made him growl. When Johnnie Green took a  bone away from him Spot couldn't help warning him, with a deep, rumbling  grumbling, that he was going too far, even between friends. But he never  snapped at Johnnie. That growling was only Spot's way of teaching  Johnnie Green manners.    Fond as he was of his young master, Spot did not care to spend all his  time playing childish games. There were grown-up things that he liked  to do--things in which a toddler like Johnnie Green couldn't take part.  Around the farmhouse there were always the cat to be teased and  squirrels to be chased into trees. In the pasture there were woodchucks  to be hunted; and even if he couldn't catch them it was fun to see those  fat fellows tumble into their holes.    Then there were the cows. Spot loved to help Farmer Green drive them  home late in the afternoon. He acted very important when he went for the  cows, always pretending that it was hard work, though he really thought  it great sport.    Sometimes when Johnnie Green wanted to play with Spot the old dog  couldn't be found anywhere. He might be over the hill, visiting a  neighbor's dog. He might be in the woods, looking for birds. He might  even have followed a wagon to the village.    As Johnnie Green grew older he roamed through the woods with Spot. And  when Johnnie's father at last let him own a gun, old Spot was as pleased  as Johnnie was.    \"I've been waiting for this event for several years,\" Spot told the  Muley Cow.    She did not share his delight.    \"For pity's sake, keep that boy and his gun out of the pasture!\" she  bellowed. \"It frightens me to have him come near me with his  blunderbuss.\"    Old Spot gave her a pitying look.    \"It's plain,\" he said, \"that you don't come from a sporting family, as I  do, or you'd never speak in that fashion of a nice new shotgun. You know  I'm a sporting dog. I'm a pointer. I point out the game for the  hunters.\"    The Muley Cow gave a sort of snort and tossed her head.    \"It's lucky for Johnnie Green,\" she sniffed, \"that I'm not a sporting  cow, or he might not have any butter on his bread.\"          II    TEASING THE CAT      When Miss Kitty Cat came to the farmhouse to live she soon showed old  dog Spot that she could fight like a vixen. The first time he cornered  her she put some scratches on his nose that he never forgot. And after  that he always took great pains to keep out of reach of Miss Kitty's  claws.    So long as Miss Kitty Cat ran away from him Spot would follow her,  yelping madly. But when she stopped, he stopped too, digging his own  claws into the dirt in order to leave a safe distance between Miss Kitty  and his nose.    He quickly discovered that there were ways in which he could tease Miss  Kitty Cat that annoyed her greatly, while keeping his nose out of harm's  way. Growling always made her tail grow big. Barking made her spit at  him. But there was something else that angered her still more. When Spot  stood stock still one day, with his tail stuck straight out behind him,  and pointed at her with his nose, he made her almost frantic.    \"What are you pointing at with that long nose of yours?\" Miss Kitty Cat  snarled.    Spot didn't say a word. For the moment he didn't move any more than the  iron dog did, that stood in a yard on the outskirts of the village and  never so much as wagged his tail from one year's end to another.    Somehow Spot's queer behavior gave Miss Kitty Cat an odd, creepy  feeling along her back. Her fur rose on end. She glared at Spot and spat  at him in a most unladylike fashion.    Spot found it very hard to stand still and never let out a single yelp.  Once he almost whined. But he managed to stifle the sound.    \"If she swells up much more she's likely to burst,\" he thought.    \"Go away!\" Miss Kitty scolded. \"Don't you know better than to stare at a  lady?\"    Never an answer did old Spot make.    It was a little more than Miss Kitty Cat could endure. With a yowl that  had in it something of anger and something of fear, too, she jumped off  the doorstep where she had been sitting and whisked around the corner of  the house.    With Miss Kitty's first leap Spot came suddenly to life. He barked  joyfully and followed her. Miss Kitty Cat ran up a tree in the yard and  stayed there until Spot went off chuckling.    \"I'm glad I played that trick on her,\" he said to himself. \"It seems to  bother her more than anything else I've ever tried.\"    Thereafter Spot often pointed at Miss Kitty when he met her, either  inside the house or about the yard. And she never failed to fly into a  passion.    \"Such manners I never saw!\" she spluttered when she talked one day with  a cat from the nearest farmhouse.    \"I'd soon cure the old dog of that unpleasant trick if he tried it on  me,\" her neighbor remarked.    \"What would you do?\" Miss Kitty Cat wanted to know.    \"I'd chase him.\"    \"He can run faster than I can,\" said Miss Kitty.    \"When he's pointing at you, jump at him before he can turn around. If  you drag your claws across his nose just once he'll be careful after  that to look the other way when he sees you.\"    \"Your plan sounds as if it might be worth trying,\" said Miss Kitty  thoughtfully.          III    A WILD DOG      Old dog Spot felt greatly pleased with himself. He had told everybody  that would listen to him how he could make Miss Kitty Cat angry just by  standing still and pointing at her.    \"You'd better leave that cat alone,\" the old horse Ebenezer advised him.  \"Don't you remember how she clawed you when you cornered her in this  barn one day?\"    \"I remember--yes!\" Spot admitted, as he looked cross-eyed at his nose,  which still bore the marks of Miss Kitty's claws. \"I'm careful not to  stand too near her,\" he explained. \"I don't try to grab her. I just  stare at her. And she gets wild.\"    \"A wild cat,\" old Ebenezer warned him, \"is a dangerous creature.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said Spot. \"She always sneaks away after I've pointed at her  for a few minutes. It's the funniest sight! If you could see it once  you'd know she was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30677"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's Note: Title page added.             *       *       *       *       *           BIRDS     A MONTHLY SERIAL     ILLUSTRATED BY COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY     DESIGNED TO PROMOTE     KNOWLEDGE OF BIRD-LIFE       VOLUME II.

John James Audubon has always been a favorite with the writer, for the  invincibleness of his love of Nature and of birds is only equalled by  the spontaneous freshness of his style, springing from an affectionate  and joyous nature. Recently there was found by accident, in an old  calf-skin bound volume, an autobiography of the naturalist. It is  entitled \"Audubon's Story of his Youth,\" and would make a very pretty  book. As introductory to the diaries and ornithological biographies of  the birds, it would be very useful.    Two or three incidents in the life of this fascinating character are  interesting as showing the influence of the accidental in ultimate  achievement.    \"One incident,\" he says, \"which is as perfect in my memory as if it had  occurred this very day, I have thought thousands of times since, and  will now put on paper as one of the curious things which perhaps did  lead me in after times to love birds, and to finally study them with  pleasure infinite. My mother had several beautiful parrots, and some  monkeys; one of the latter was a full-grown male of a very large  species. One morning, while the servants were engaged in arranging  the room I was in, 'Pretty Polly' asking for her breakfast as usual,  '_Du pain au lait pour le perroquet Mignonne_,' (bread and milk for  the parrot Mignonne,) the man of the woods probably thought the bird  presuming upon his rights in the scale of nature; be this as it may, he  certainly showed his supremacy in strength over the denizen of the air,  for, walking deliberately and uprightly toward the poor bird, he at once  killed it, with unnatural composure. The sensations of my infant heart  at this cruel sight were agony to me. I prayed the servant to beat the  monkey, but he, who for some reason, preferred the monkey to the parrot,  refused. I uttered long and piercing cries, my mother rushed into the  room; I was tranquilized; the monkey was forever afterward chained, and  Mignonne buried with all the pomp of a cherished lost one. This made, as  I have said, a very deep impression on my youthful mind.\"    In consequence of the long absences of his father, who was an admiral in  the French navy, the young naturalist's education was neglected, his  mother suffering him to do much as he pleased, and it was not to be  wondered at, as he says, that instead of applying closely to his  studies, he preferred associating with boys of his own age and  disposition, who were more fond of going in search of bird's nests,  fishing, or shooting, than of better studies. Thus almost every day,  instead of going to school, he usually made for the fields where he  spent the day, returning with his little basket filled with what he  called curiosities, such as birds' nests, birds' eggs, curious lichens,  flowers of all sorts, and even pebbles gathered along the shore of some  rivulet. Nevertheless, he did study drawing and music, for which he had  some talent. His subsequent study of drawing under the celebrated David,  richly equipped him for a work which he did not know was ever to be his,  and enabled him to commence a series of drawings of birds of France,  which he continued until he had upwards of two hundred completed. \"All  bad enough,\" he says, \"yet they were representations of birds, and I  felt pleased with them.\" Before sailing for France, he had begun a  series of drawings of the birds of America, and had also begun a study  of their habits. His efforts were commended by one of his friends, who  assured him the time might come when he should be a great American  naturalist, which had such weight with him that he felt a certain degree  of pride in the words, even then, when he was about eighteen years of  age.    \"The store at Louisville went on prosperously, when I attended to it;  but birds were birds then as now, and my thoughts were ever and anon  turning toward them as the objects of my greatest delight. I shot, I  drew, I looked on nature only; my days were happy beyond human  conception, and beyond this I really cared not.\" [How like Agassiz, who  said he had not time to make money.] As he could not bear to give the  attention required by his business, his business abandoned him. \"Indeed,  I never thought of business beyond the ever-engaging journeys which I  was in the habit of taking to Philadelphia or New York, to purchase  goods; those journeys I greatly enjoyed, as they afforded me ample means  to study birds and their habits as I traveled through the beautiful, the  darling forests of Ohio, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania.\" Poor fellow, how  many ups and downs he had! He lost everything and became burdened with  debt. But he did not despair for had he not a talent for drawing? He at  once undertook to take portraits of the human head divine in black  chalk, and thanks to his master, David, succeeded admirably. He  established a large drawing school at Cincinnati, and formed an  engagement to stuff birds for the museum there at a large salary.    \"One of the most extraordinary things among all these adverse  circumstances\" he adds, \"was, that I never for a day give up listening  to the songs of our birds, or watching their peculiar habits, or  delineating them in the best way I could; nay, during my deepest  troubles, I frequently would wrench myself from the persons around me  and retire to some secluded part of our noble forests; and many a time,  at the sound of the wood-thrushes' melodies, have I fallen on my knees  and there prayed earnestly to our God. This never failed to bring me  the most valuable of thoughts, and always comfort, and it was often  necessary for me to exert my will and compel myself to return to my  fellow-beings.\"    Do you not fancy that Audubon was himself a _rara avis_ and worthy of  admiration and study?    Such a man, in the language of a contemporary, should have a monument in  the old Creole country in which he was born, and whose birds inspired  his childish visions. It should be the most beautiful work possible to  the sculptor's art, portraying Audubon in the garb he wore when he was  proud and happy to be called the \"American Woodman,\" and at his feet  should stand the Eagle which he named the \"Bird of Washington,\" and near  should perch the Mocking Bird, as once, in his description, it flew and  fluttered and sang to the mind's eye and ear from the pages of the old  reading book.

Co., 1897, Chicago.]    THE SUMMER TANAGER.      The tanagers are birds of such uncommon beauty that when we have taken  the pictures of the entire family the group will be a notable one and  will add attractiveness to the portfolio. [See Vol. I, pp. 31 and 216.]  This specimen is also called the Summer Red-bird or Rose Tanager, and is  found pretty generally distributed over the United States during the  summer months, wintering in Cuba, Central America, and northern South  America. As will be seen, the adult male is a plain vermilion red. The  plumage of the female is less attractive. In habits this species  resembles the Scarlet Tanager, perhaps the most brilliant of the group,  but is not so retiring, frequenting open groves and often visiting towns  and cities.    The nesting season of this charming bird extends to the latter part of  July, but varies with the latitude and season. Bark strips and leaves  interwoven with various vegetable substances compose the nest, which is  usually built on a horizontal or drooping branch, near its extremity and  situated at the edge of a grove near the roadside. Davie says: \"All the  nests of this species which I have seen collected in Ohio are very thin  and frail structures; so thin that the eggs may often be seen from  beneath. A nest sent me from Lee county, Texas, is compactly built of  a cottony weed, a few stems of Spanish moss, and lined with fine grass  stems.\" Mr. L. O. Pindar states that nests found in Kentucky are  compactly built, but not very thickly lined. The eggs are beautiful,  being a bright, light emerald green, spotted, dotted, and blotched with  various shades of lilac, brownish-purple, and dark brown.    Chapman says the Summer Tanager may be easily identified, not alone by  its color but by its unique call-note, a clearly enunciated _chicky,  tucky, tuck_. Its song bears a general resemblance to that of the  Scarlet, but to some ears is much sweeter, better sustained, and more  musical. It equals in strength, according to one authority, that of the  Robin, but is uttered more hurriedly, is more \"wiry,\" and much more  continued.    The Summer Tanager is to a greater or less extent known to farmers as  the Red Bee-Bird. Its food consists largely of hornets, wasps, and bees.    The male of this species requires several years to attain the full  plumage. Immature individuals, it is said, show a mixture of red and  yellow in relative proportions according to age. The female has more red  than the male, but the tint is peculiar, a dull Chinese orange, instead  of a pure rosy vermilion, as in the male.    An interesting study for many of our readers during the summer months  when the Tanagers are gay in their full plumage, would be to seek out,  with BIRDS in hand, the most attractive denizens of the groves,  identifying"]]]
