McClurg & Co.                                   1901.                TO MY READERS.      Thirty years ago Central Africa was what people who are fond of airing  their learning would call a terra incognita. To-day its general  characteristics are pretty well known. Then, as now, the little  island of Zanzibar, situated just south of the equator, on the east  coast, was the starting place of all expeditions into the interior,  and Unguja (pronounced Oon-goo'jah), the big town of that island, the  place where the preparations for plunging into the unknown were made.    At that period these expeditions consisted, almost without exception,  of caravans loaded with beads and cotton cloth, which were exchanged  among the inland tribes for elephants' tusks and slaves--for Unguja  boasted the only, and the last, open slave-market in the world then.    The few exceptions were a would-be discoverer now and then, or a  party of rich white men going to hunt \"big game;\" that is, travelling  hundreds--aye, thousands--of miles, and enduring many hardships,  for the momentary pleasure of holding a gun in such a position that  when they pulled the trigger the bullet hit such a prominent mark as  an elephant or a lion, which was living in its natural surroundings  and interfering with no one.    Between you and me, I don't mind remarking that many of their  expeditions ended, on their return to Unguja, in the purchase of a  few elephants' tusks and wild animal skins in the bazaars of that  thriving city, after the method pursued by unsuccessful anglers in  civilized countries.    But even the most successful of these hunters, by reason of having  followed the few beaten paths known to their guides, never came  within miles of such wonderful animals as those described by the  tribesmen from the very center of the dark continent. If you have  read any accounts of adventure in Africa, you will know that travelers  never mention animals of any kind that are gifted with the faculty of  speech, or gazelles that are overseers for native princes, or hares  that eat flesh. No, indeed; only the native-born know of these; and,  judging by the immense and rapid strides civilization is making in  those parts, it will not be long before such wonderful specimens of  zoology will be as extinct as the ichthyosaurus, dinornis, and other  poor creatures who never dreamed of the awful names that would be  applied to them when they were too long dead to show their resentment.    As to the truth of these tales, I can only say that they were told  to me, in Zanzibar, by negroes whose ancestors told them to them,  who had received them from their ancestors, and so back; so that the  praise for their accuracy, or the blame for their falsity, lies with  the first ancestor who set them going.    You may think uncivilized negroes are pretty ignorant people, but the  white man who is supposed to have first told the story of \"The House  that Jack Built\" was a mighty poor genius compared with the unknown  originator of \"Goso, the Teacher,\" who found even inanimate things  that were endowed with speech, which the pupils readily understood and  were not astonished to hear; while \"Puss in Boots\" was not one-half  so clever as the gazelle that ran things for Haamdaanee. It would be a  severe task to rattle off \"Goso\" as you do \"The House that Jack Built.\"    Don't stumble over the names in these tales; they are very easy. Every  one is pronounced exactly as it is spelled, and the accent is always on  the last syllable but one; as, Poon'dah, the donkey; Haam-daa'nee, etc.    Finally, if the perusal of these tales interests you as much as  their narration and translation interested me, everything will be  satisfactory.

I.    THE MONKEY, THE SHARK, AND THE WASHERMAN'S DONKEY.      Once upon a time Kee'ma, the monkey, and Pa'pa, the shark, became  great friends.    The monkey lived in an immense mkooyoo tree which grew by the margin  of the sea--half of its branches being over the water and half over  the land.    Every morning, when the monkey was breakfasting on the kooyoo nuts,  the shark would put in an appearance under the tree and call out,  \"Throw me some food, my friend;\" with which request the monkey complied  most willingly.    This continued for many months, until one day Papa said, \"Keema,  you have done me many kindnesses: I would like you to go with me to  my home, that I may repay you.\"    \"How can I go?\" said the monkey; \"we land beasts can not go about in  the water.\"    \"Don't trouble yourself about that,\" replied the shark; \"I will carry  you. Not a drop of water shall get to you.\"    \"Oh, all right, then,\" said Mr. Keema; \"let's go.\"    When they had gone about half-way the shark stopped, and said:  \"You are my friend. I will tell you the truth.\"    \"Why, what is there to tell?\" asked the monkey, with surprise.    \"Well, you see, the fact is that our sultan is very sick, and we  have been told that the only medicine that will do him any good is  a monkey's heart.\"    \"Well,\" exclaimed Keema, \"you were very foolish not to tell me that  before we started!\"    \"How so?\" asked Papa.    But the monkey was busy thinking up some means of saving himself,  and made no reply.    \"Well?\" said the shark, anxiously; \"why don't you speak?\"    \"Oh, I've nothing to say now. It's too late. But if you had told me  this before we started, I might have brought my heart with me.\"    \"What? haven't you your heart here?\"    \"Huh!\" ejaculated Keema; \"don't you know about us? When we go out we  leave our hearts in the trees, and go about with only our bodies. But  I see you don't believe me. You think I'm scared. Come on; let's go  to your home, where you can kill me and search for my heart in vain.\"    The shark did believe him, though, and exclaimed, \"Oh, no; let's go  back and get your heart.\"    \"Indeed, no,\" protested Keema; \"let us go on to your home.\"    But the shark insisted that they should go back, get the heart,  and start afresh.    At last, with great apparent reluctance, the monkey consented,  grumbling sulkily at the unnecessary trouble he was being put to.    When they got back to the tree, he climbed up in a great hurry,  calling out, \"Wait there, Papa, my friend, while I get my heart,  and we'll start off properly next time.\"    When he had got well up among the branches, he sat down and kept  quite still.    After waiting what he considered a reasonable length of time, the  shark called, \"Come along, Keema!\" But Keema just kept still and  said nothing.    In a little while he called again: \"Oh, Keema! let's be going.\"    At this the monkey poked his head out from among the upper branches  and asked, in great surprise, \"Going? Where?\"    \"To my home, of course.\"    \"Are you mad?\" queried Keema.    \"Mad? Why, what do you mean?\" cried Papa.    \"What's the matter with you?\" said the monkey. \"Do you take me for  a washerman's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/375"],[0,"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (#1)"],[1,"OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE      by    Ambrose Bierce    THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION, 1988        A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down  into the swift water twenty feet below.  The man's hands were behind  his back, the wrists bound with a cord.  A rope closely encircled his  neck.  It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the  slack fell to the level of his knees.  Some loose boards laid upon the  ties supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him  and his executioners--two private soldiers of the Federal army,  directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy  sheriff.  At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an  officer in the uniform of his rank, armed.  He was a captain.  A  sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the  position known as \"support,\" that is to say, vertical in front of the  left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight  across the chest--a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect  carriage of the body.  It did not appear to be the duty of these two  men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they  merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it.    Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran  straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was  lost to view.  Doubtless there was an outpost farther along.  The  other bank of the stream was open ground--a gentle slope topped with  a stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a  single embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon  commanding the bridge.  Midway up the slope between the bridge and  fort were the spectators--a single company of infantry in line, at  \"parade rest,\" the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels  inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands  crossed upon the stock. A lieutenant stood at the right of the line,  the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his  right.  Excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a  man moved.  The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless.  The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues  to adorn the bridge.  The captain stood with folded arms, silent,  observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign. Death is a  dignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal  manifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him.  In  the code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of  deference.    The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about  thirty-five years of age.  He was a civilian, if one might judge from  his habit, which was that of a planter.  His features were good--a  straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark  hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar  of his well fitting frock coat.  He wore a moustache and pointed  beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a  kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose  neck was in the hemp.  Evidently this was no vulgar assassin.  The  liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of  persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.    The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped  aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing.  The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself  immediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace.  These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on  the two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties  of the bridge.  The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not  quite, reached a fourth.  This plank had been held in place by the  weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant.  At a  signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would  tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties.  The arrangement  commended itself to his judgement as simple and effective.  His face  had not been covered nor his eyes bandaged.  He looked a moment at his  \"unsteadfast footing,\" then let his gaze wander to the swirling water  of the stream racing madly beneath his feet. A piece of dancing  driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the  current.  How slowly it appeared to move!  What a sluggish stream!    He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and  children.  The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding  mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the  soldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him.  And now he  became conscious of a new disturbance.  Striking through the thought  of his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor  understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of  a blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality.  He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by--  it seemed both.  Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the  tolling of a death knell.  He awaited each new stroke with impatience  and--he knew not why--apprehension.  The intervals of silence grew  progressively longer; the delays became maddening.  With their greater  infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness.  They hurt  his ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared he would shriek.  What he  heard was the ticking of his watch.    He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him.  \"If I could  free my hands,\" he thought, \"I might throw off the noose and spring  into the stream.  By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming  vigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home.  My  home, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little  ones are still beyond the invader's farthest advance.\"    As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were  flashed into the doomed man's brain rather than evolved from it the  captain nodded to the sergeant.  The sergeant stepped aside.    II    Peyton Farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly  respected Alabama family.  Being a slave owner and like other slave  owners a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and  ardently devoted to the Southern cause.  Circumstances of an imperious  nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from  taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous  campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the  inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the  larger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction.  That  opportunity, he felt, would come, as it comes to all in wartime.  Meanwhile he did what he could.  No service was too humble for him to  perform in the aid of the South, no adventure too perilous for him to  undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at  heart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much  qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous  dictum that all is fair in love and war.    One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench  near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the  gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy  to serve him with her own white hands.  While she was fetching the  water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly  for news from the front.    \"The Yanks are repairing the railroads,\" said the man, \"and are  getting ready for another advance.  They have reached the Owl Creek  bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank.  The  commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring  that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges,  tunnels, or trains will be summarily hanged.  I saw the order.\"    \"How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?\" Farquhar asked.    \"About thirty miles.\"    \"Is there no force on this side of the creek?\"    \"Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single  sentinel at this end of the bridge.\"    \"Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the  picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,\" said  Farquhar, smiling, \"what could he accomplish?\"    The soldier reflected.  \"I was there a month ago,\" he replied.  \"I  observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of  driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge.  It is  now dry and would burn like tinder.\"    The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He  thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.  An  hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going  northward in the direction from which he had come.  He was a Federal  scout.    III    As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost  consciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was  awakened--ages later, it seemed to him--by the pain of a sharp  pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation.  Keen,  poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every  fiber of his body and limbs.  These pains appeared to flash along well  defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid  periodicity.  They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him  to an intolerable temperature.  As to his head, he was conscious of  nothing but a feeling of fullness--of congestion.  These sensations  were unaccompanied by thought.  The intellectual part of his nature  was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was  torment.  He was conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud,  of which he was"]]]
