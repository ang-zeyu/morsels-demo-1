The present work, however, is the outcome of  the need of a text-book of very simple outline, in which causes  and their consequences should be knit together as closely as  possible,--a need long felt by the author in his teaching, and  perhaps by other teachers also. The author has ventured,  therefore, to depart from the common usage which subdivides  geology into a number of departments,--dynamical, structural,  physiographic, and historical,--and to treat in immediate  connection with each geological process the land forms and the  rock structures which it has produced.    It is hoped that the facts of geology and the inferences drawn  from them have been so presented as to afford an efficient  discipline in inductive reasoning. Typical examples have been used  to introduce many topics, and it has been the author's aim to give  due proportion to both the wide generalizations of our science and  to the concrete facts on which they rest.    There have been added a number of practical exercises such as the  author has used for several years in the class room. These are not  made so numerous as to displace the problems which no doubt many  teachers prefer to have their pupils solve impromptu during the  recitation, but may, it is hoped, suggest their use.    In historical geology a broad view is given of the development of  the North American continent and the evolution of life upon the  planet. Only the leading types of plants and animals are  mentioned, and special attention is given to those which mark the  lines of descent of forms now living.    By omitting much technical detail of a mineralogical and  paleontological nature, and by confining the field of view almost  wholly to our own continent, space has been obtained to give to  what are deemed for beginners the essentials of the science a  fuller treatment than perhaps is common.    It is assumed that field work will be introduced with the  commencement of the study. The common rocks are therefore briefly  described in the opening chapters. The drift also receives early  mention, and teachers in the northern states who begin geology in  the fall may prefer to take up the chapter on the Pleistocene  immediately after the chapter on glaciers.    Simple diagrams have been used freely, not only because they are  often clearer than any verbal statement, but also because they  readily lend themselves to reproduction on the blackboard by the  pupil. The text will suggest others which the pupil may invent. It  is hoped that the photographic views may also be used for  exercises in the class room.    The generous aid of many friends is recognized with special  pleasure. To Professor W. M. Davis of Harvard University there is  owing a large obligation for the broad conceptions and luminous  statements of geologic facts and principles with which he has  enriched the literature of our science, and for his stimulating  influence in education. It is hoped that both in subject-matter  and in method the book itself makes evident this debt. But besides  a general obligation shared by geologists everywhere, and in  varying degrees by perhaps all authors of recent American text-  books in earth science, there is owing a debt direct and personal.  The plan of the book, with its use of problems and treatment of  land forms and rock structures in immediate connection with the  processes which produce them, was submitted to Professor Davis,  and, receiving his approval, was carried into effect, although  without the sanction of precedent at the time. Professor Davis  also kindly consented to read the manuscript throughout, and his  many helpful criticisms and suggestions are acknowledged with  sincere gratitude.    Parts of the manuscript have been reviewed by Dr. Samuel Calvin  and Dr. Frank M. Wilder of the State University of Iowa; Dr. S. W.  Beyer of the Iowa College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Dr. U.  S. Grant of Northwestern University; Professor J. A. Udden of  Augustana College, Illinois; Dr. C. H. Gordon of the New Mexico  State School of Mines; Principal Maurice Ricker of the High  School, Burlington, Iowa; and the following former students of the  author who are engaged in the earth sciences: Dr. W. C. Alden of  the United States Geological Survey and the University of Chicago;  Mr. Joseph Sniffen, instructor in the Academy of the University of  Chicago, Morgan Park; Professor Martin Iorns, Fort Worth  University, Texas; Professor A. M. Jayne, Dakota University;  Professor G. H. Bretnall, Monmouth College, Illinois; Professor  Howard E. Simpson, Colby College, Maine; Mr. E. J. Cable,  instructor in the Iowa State Normal College; Principal C. C. Gray  of the High School, Fargo, North Dakota; and Mr. Charles Persons  of the High School, Hannibal, Missouri. A large number of the  diagrams of the book were drawn by Mr. W. W. White of the Art  School of Cornell College. To all these friends, and to the many  who have kindly supplied the illustrations of the text, whose  names are mentioned in an appended list, the writer returns his  heartfelt thanks.    WILLIAM HARMON NORTON    CORNELL COLLEGE, MOUNT VERNON, IOWA    JULY, 1905            INTRODUCTORY NOTE    During the preparation of this book Professor Norton has  frequently discussed its plan with me by correspondence, and we  have considered together the matters of scope, arrangement, and  presentation.    As to scope, the needs of the young student and not of the expert  have been our guide; the book is therefore a text-book, not a  reference volume.    In arrangement, the twofold division of the subject was chosen  because of its simplicity and effectiveness. The principles of  physical geology come first; the several chapters are arranged in  what is believed to be a natural order, appropriate to the  greatest part of our country, so that from a simple beginning a  logical sequence of topics leads through the whole subject. The  historical view of the science comes second, with many specific  illustrations of the physical processes previously studied, but  now set forth as part of the story of the earth, with its many  changes of aspect and its succession of inhabitants. Special  attention is here given to North America, and care is taken to  avoid overloading with details.    With respect to method of presentation, it must not be forgotten  that the text-book is only one factor in good teaching, and that  in geology, as in other sciences, the teacher, the laboratory, and  the local field are other factors, each of which should play an  appropriate part. The text suggests observational methods, but it  cannot replace observation in field or laboratory; it offers  certain exercises, but space cannot be taken to make it a  laboratory manual as well as a book for study; it explains many  problems, but its statements are necessarily more terse than the  illustrative descriptions that a good and experienced teacher  should supply. Frequent use is made of induction and inference in  order that the student may come to see how reasonable a science is  geology, and that he may avoid the too common error of thinking  that the opinions of \"authorities\" are reached by a private road  that is closed to him. The further extension of this method of  presentation is urged upon the teacher, so that the young  geologist may always learn the evidence that leads to a  conclusion, and not only the conclusion itself.

It learns from  their composition and structure how the rocks were made and how  they have been modified. It ascertains how they have been brought  to their present places and wrought to their various topographic  forms, such as hills and valleys, plains and mountains. It studies  the vestiges which the rocks preserve of ancient organisms which  once inhabited our planet. Geology is the history of the earth and  its inhabitants, as read in the rocks of the earth's crust.    To obtain a general idea of the nature and method of our science  before beginning its study in detail, we may visit some valley,  such as that illustrated in the frontispiece, on whose sides are  rocky ledges. Here the rocks lie in horizontal layers. Although  only their edges are exposed, we may infer that these layers run  into the upland on either side and underlie the entire district;  they are part of the foundation of solid rock which everywhere is  found beneath the loose materials of the surface.    The ledges of the valley of our illustration are of sandstone.  Looking closely at the rock we see that it is composed of myriads  of grains of sand cemented together.

STEVENSON        PREFACE TO THE BIOGRAPHICAL EDITION    While my husband and Mr. Henley were engaged in writing plays in  Bournemouth they made a number of titles, hoping to use them in the  future. Dramatic composition was not what my husband preferred, but  the torrent of Mr. Henley's enthusiasm swept him off his feet. However,  after several plays had been finished, and his health seriously impaired  by his endeavours to keep up with Mr. Henley, play writing was abandoned  forever, and my husband returned to his legitimate vocation. Having  added one of the titles, The Hanging Judge, to the list of projected  plays, now thrown aside, and emboldened by my husband's offer to give me  any help needed, I concluded to try and write it myself.    As I wanted a trial scene in the Old Bailey, I chose the period of 1700  for my purpose; but being shamefully ignorant of my subject, and my  husband confessing to little more knowledge than I possessed, a London  bookseller was commissioned to send us everything he could procure  bearing on Old Bailey trials. A great package came in response to our  order, and very soon we were both absorbed, not so much in the trials  as in following the brilliant career of a Mr. Garrow, who appeared as  counsel in many of the cases. We sent for more books, and yet more,  still intent on Mr. Garrow, whose subtle cross-examination of witnesses  and masterly, if sometimes startling, methods of arriving at the truth  seemed more thrilling to us than any novel.    Occasionally other trials than those of the Old Bailey would be included  in the package of books we received from London; among these my husband  found and read with avidity:--         THE       TRIAL       OF       JAMES STEWART       in Aucharn in Duror of Appin       FOR THE       Murder of COLIN CAMPBELL of Glenure, Efq;       Factor for His Majefty on the forfeited       Estate of Ardfhiel.    My husband was always interested in this period of his country's  history, and had already the intention of writing a story that should  turn on the Appin murder. The tale was to be of a boy, David Balfour,  supposed to belong to my husband's own family, who should travel in  Scotland as though it were a foreign country, meeting with various  adventures and misadventures by the way. From the trial of James Stewart  my husband gleaned much valuable material for his novel, the most  important being the character of Alan Breck. Aside from having described  him as \"smallish in stature,\" my husband seems to have taken Alan  Breck's personal appearance, even to his clothing, from the book.    A letter from James Stewart to Mr. John Macfarlane, introduced as  evidence in the trial, says: \"There is one Alan Stewart, a distant  friend of the late Ardshiel's, who is in the French service, and came  over in March last, as he said to some, in order to settle at home; to  others, that he was to go soon back; and was, as I hear, the day that  the murder was committed, seen not far from the place where it happened,  and is not now to be seen; by which it is believed he was the actor. He  is a desperate foolish fellow; and if he is guilty, came to the country  for that very purpose. He is a tall, pock-pitted lad, very black hair,  and wore a blue coat and metal buttons, an old red vest, and breeches of  the same colour.\" A second witness testified to having seen him wearing  \"a blue coat with silver buttons, a red waistcoat, black shag breeches,  tartan hose, and a feathered hat, with a big coat, dun coloured,\" a  costume referred to by one of the counsel as \"French cloathes which were  remarkable.\"    There are many incidents given in the trial that point to Alan's fiery  spirit and Highland quickness to take offence. One witness \"declared  also That the said Alan Breck threatened that he would challenge  Ballieveolan and his sons to fight because of his removing the  declarant last year from Glenduror.\" On another page: \"Duncan Campbell,  change-keeper at Annat, aged thirty-five years, married, witness cited,  sworn, purged and examined ut supra, depones, That, in the month of  April last, the deponent met with Alan Breck Stewart, with whom he was  not acquainted, and John Stewart, in Auchnacoan, in the house of the  walk miller of Auchofragan, and went on with them to the house: Alan  Breck Stewart said, that he hated all the name of Campbell; and the  deponent said, he had no reason for doing so: But Alan said, he had very  good reason for it: that thereafter they left that house; and, after  drinking a dram at another house, came to the deponent's house, where  they went in, and drunk some drams, and Alan Breck renewed the former  Conversation; and the deponent, making the same answer, Alan said, that,  if the deponent had any respect for his friends, he would tell them,  that if they offered to turn out the possessors of Ardshiel's estate, he  would make black cocks of them, before they entered into possession by  which the deponent understood shooting them, it being a common phrase in  the country.\"    Some time after the publication of Kidnapped we stopped for a short  while in the Appin country, where we were surprised and interested to  discover that the feeling concerning the murder of Glenure (the \"Red  Fox,\" also called \"Colin Roy\") was almost as keen as though the tragedy  had taken place the day before. For several years my husband received  letters of expostulation or commendation from members of the Campbell  and Stewart clans. I have in my possession a paper, yellow with age,  that was sent soon after the novel appeared, containing \"The Pedigree of  the Family of Appine,\" wherein it is said that \"Alan 3rd Baron of Appine  was not killed at Flowdoun, tho there, but lived to a great old age. He  married Cameron Daughter to Ewen Cameron of Lochiel.\" Following this  is a paragraph stating that \"John Stewart 1st of Ardsheall of his  descendants Alan Breck had better be omitted. Duncan Baan Stewart in  Achindarroch his father was a Bastard.\"    One day, while my husband was busily at work, I sat beside him reading  an old cookery book called The Compleat Housewife: or Accomplish'd  Gentlewoman's Companion. In the midst of receipts for \"Rabbits, and  Chickens mumbled, Pickled Samphire, Skirret Pye, Baked Tansy,\" and  other forgotten delicacies, there were directions for the preparation  of several lotions for the preservation of beauty. One of these was so  charming that I interrupted my husband to read it aloud. \"Just what  I wanted!\" he exclaimed; and the receipt for the \"Lily of the Valley  Water\" was instantly incorporated into Kidnapped.    F. V. DE G. S.          DEDICATION    MY DEAR CHARLES BAXTER:      If you ever read this tale, you will likely ask yourself more questions  than I should care to answer: as for instance how the Appin murder has  come to fall in the year 1751, how the Torran rocks have crept so near  to Earraid, or why the printed trial is silent as to all that touches  David Balfour. These are nuts beyond my ability to crack. But if you  tried me on the point of Alan's guilt or innocence, I think I could  defend the reading of the text. To this day you will find the tradition  of Appin clear in Alan's favour. If you inquire, you may even hear that  the descendants of \"the other man\" who fired the shot are in the country  to this day. But that other man's name, inquire as you please, you shall  not hear; for the Highlander values a secret for itself and for the  congenial exercise of keeping it. I might go on for long to justify one  point and own another indefensible; it is more honest to confess at once  how little I am touched by the desire of accuracy. This is no furniture  for the scholar's library, but a book for the winter evening school-room  when the tasks are over and the hour for bed draws near; and honest  Alan, who was a grim old fire-eater in his day has in this new avatar  no more desperate purpose than to steal some young gentleman's attention  from his Ovid, carry him awhile into the Highlands and the last century,  and pack him to bed with some engaging images to mingle with his dreams.    As for you, my dear Charles, I do not even ask you to like this tale.  But perhaps when he is older, your son will; he may then be pleased to  find his father's name on the fly-leaf; and in the meanwhile it pleases  me to set it there, in memory of many days that were happy and some (now  perhaps as pleasant to remember) that were sad. If it is strange for  me to look back from a distance both in time and space on these bygone  adventures of our youth, it must be stranger for you who tread the same  streets--who may to-morrow open the door of the old Speculative,  where we begin to rank with Scott and Robert Emmet and the beloved and  inglorious Macbean--or may pass the corner of the close where that great  society, the L. J. R., held its meetings and drank its beer, sitting in  the seats of Burns and his companions. I think I see you, moving there  by plain daylight, beholding with your natural eyes those places that  have now become for your companion a part of the scenery of dreams. How,  in the intervals of present business, the past must echo in your memory!  Let it not echo often without some kind thoughts of your friend,    R.L.S. SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH.
