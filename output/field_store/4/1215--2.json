INFORMATION ABOUT THIS E-TEXT EDITION    The following is the text of \"Mozart: The Man and the Artist, as  Revealed in his own Words,\" compiled and annotated by Friedrich  Kerst and translated into english, and edited, with new  introduction and additional notes, by Henry Edward Krehbiel.  Each page was cut out of the original book with an X-acto  knife and fed into an Automatic Document Feeder Scanner to  make this e-text, so the original book was disbinded in order  to save it.    Some adaptations from the original text were made while  formatting it for an e-text. Italics in the original book were  ignored in making this e-text, unless they referred to proper  nouns, in which case they are put in quotes in the e-text.  Italics are problematic because they are not easily rendered in  ASCII text.

He defined in his music a system  of musical thought and an entire state of mind that were unlike  any previously experienced. A true child prodigy, he began  composing at age 5 and rapidly developed his unmistakable style;  by 18 he was composing works capable of altering the mind-states  of entire civilizations. Indeed, he and his predecessor Bach  accomplished the Olympian feat of adding to the human concepts of  civility and civilization. So these two were not just musical  geniuses, but geniuses of the humanities.    Mozart's music IS civilization. It encompasses all that is humane  about an idealized civilization. And it probably was Mozart's  main purpose to create and propagate a concept of a great  civilization through his music. He wanted to show his fellow  Europeans, with their garbage-polluted citystreets, their violent  mono-maniacal leaders and their stifling, non-humane bureaucracies,  new ideas on how to run their civilizations properly. He wanted  them to hear and feel a sense of civilized movement, of the  musical expressions of man moving as he would if upholding the  highest values of idealized societies. One need only listen to  the revolutionary opening bars of his famous Eine Kleine  Nachtmusik to see this.    He was an extremely sophisticated and complex man. His letters  reveal him as remarkably creative, fascinated by the arts,  principled, religious and devoted to his father. He had an  energetic personality that was almost completely devoid of any  cynicism, pessimism or discouragement from creating music. While  rumors suggest that he was a lascivious individual, there is no  evidence of this at all in his letters. Quite the contrary, the  evidence seems overwhelmingly to suggest the opposite, and that  Mozart may not have had any relations with women except with his  own wife.    He was not as shrewd as he was civilized, however. He was  peculiarly lax about profiting from his history-changing music.  His promoters constantly short-changed him.    He died nearly penniless and in debt, and at his death at age 35  an apathetic public took little notice of this man who had done  so much in service to civilization. He was buried in an unmarked  pauper's grave with few mourners. After his death, the bones of  this great paragon of self-sacrifice for the sake of improving  civilization were dug up and disposed of. His grave was then  re-used, and to this day no one knows where his bones lie. Perhaps  they are in a catacomb somewhere, in a huge bone-pile containing  thousands of anonymous cadavers.    But the sounds he heard in his head live on, stimulating millions  in elevators, doctors' offices, train terminals, concert halls  and myriad other places to be more civilized, assuming that they  pay attention to the music.        EDITOR'S NOTE        The purpose and scope of this little book will be obvious to the  reader from even a cursory glance at its contents. It is, in a  way, an autobiography of Mozart written without conscious  purpose, and for that reason peculiarly winning, illuminating and  convincing. The outward things in Mozart's life are all but  ignored in it, but there is a frank and full disclosure of the  great musician's artistic, intellectual and moral character, made  in his own words.    The Editor has not only taken the trouble to revise the work of  the German author and compiler, but, for reasons which seemed to  him imperative, has also made a new translation of all the  excerpts. Most of the translations of Mozart's letters which have  found their way into the books betray want of familiarity with  the idioms and colloquialisms employed by Mozart, as well as  understanding of his careless, contradictory and sprawling  epistolary style. Some of the intimacy of that style the new  translation seeks to preserve, but the purpose has chiefly been  to make the meaning plain.      H.E.K.      New York, June 7, 1905        THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MOZART        Mozart! What a radiance streams from the name! Bright and pure as  the light of the sun, Mozart's music greets us. We pronounce his  name and behold! the youthful artist is before us,--the merry,  light-hearted smile upon his features, which belongs only to true  and naive genius. It is impossible to imagine an aged Mozart,--an  embittered and saddened Mozart,--glowering gloomily at a wicked  world which is doing its best to make his lot still more  burdensome;--a Mozart whose music should reflect such painful  moods.    Mozart was a Child of the Sun. Filled with a humor truly divine,  he strolled unconstrainedly through a multitude of cares like  Prince Tamino through his fantastic trials. Music was his  talisman, his magic flute with which he could exorcise all the  petty terrors that beset him. Has such a man and artist--one who  was completely resolved in his works, and therefore still stands  bodily before us with all his glorious qualities after the lapse  of a century--has Mozart still something to say to us who have  just stepped timidly into a new century separated by another from  that of the composer? Much; very much. Many prophets have arisen  since Mozart's death; two of them have moved us profoundly with  their evangel. One of them knew all the mysteries, and Nature  took away his hearing lest he proclaim too much. We followed him  into all the depths of the world of feeling. The other shook us  awake and placed us in the hurly-burly of national life and  striving; pointing to his own achievements, he said: \"If you wish  it, you have now a German art!\" The one was Beethoven,--the other  Wagner. Because their music demands of us that we share with it  its experiences and struggles, they are the guiding spirits of a  generation which has grown up in combat and is expecting an  unknown world of combat beyond the morning mist of the new  century.    But we are in the case of the man in the fairy tale who could not  forget the merry tune of the forest bird which he had heard as a  boy. We gladly permit ourselves to be led, occasionally, out of  the rude realities that surround us, into a beautiful world that  knows no care but lies forever bathed in the sunshine of  cloudless happiness,--a world in which every loveliness of which  fancy has dreamed has taken life and form. It is because of this  that we make pilgrimages to the masterpieces of the plastic arts,  that we give heed to the speech of Schiller, listen to the music  of Mozart. When wearied by the stress of life we gladly hie to  Mozart that he may tell us stories of that land of beauty, and  convince us that there are other and better occupations than the  worries and combats of the fleeting hour. This is what Mozart has  to tell us today. In spite of Wagner he has an individual mission  to fulfill which will keep him immortal. \"That of which Lessing  convinces us only with expenditure of many words sounds clear and  irresistible in 'The Magic Flute':--the longing for light and  day. Therefore there is something like the glory of daybreak in  the tones of Mozart's opera; it is wafted towards us like the  morning breeze which dispels the shadows and invokes the sun.\"    Mozart remains ever young; one reason is because death laid hold  of him in the middle of his career. While all the world was still  gazing expectantly upon him, he vanished from the earth and left  no hope deceived. His was the enviable fate of a Raphael,  Schiller and Korner. As the German ('tis Schumann's utterance)  thinks of Beethoven when he speaks the word symphony, so the name  of Mozart in his mind is associated with the conception of things  youthful, bright and sunny. Schumann was fully conscious of a  purpose when he called out, \"Do not put Beethoven in the hands of  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4060"],[0,"The Renaissance: studies in art and poetry (#1)"],[1,"and proofed by Alfred J.

NOTES BY THE E-TEXT EDITOR:    Notes: The 1910 Library Edition employs footnotes, a  style inconvenient in an electronic edition.  I have therefore  placed an asterisk immediately after each of Pater's footnotes  and a + sign after my own notes, and have listed each chapter's  notes at that chapter's end.    Pagination and Paragraphing: To avoid an unwieldy electronic copy,  I have transferred original pagination to brackets.  A bracketed  numeral such as [22] indicates that the material immediately  following the number marks the beginning of the relevant page.  I  have preserved paragraph structure except for first-line indentation.    Hyphenation: I have not preserved original hyphenation since an  e-text does not require line-end or page-end hyphenation.    Greek typeface: For this full-text edition, I have transliterated  Pater's Greek quotations.  If there is a need for the original Greek, it  can be viewed at my site, http://www.ajdrake.com/etexts, a Victorianist  archive that contains the complete works of Walter Pater and many other  nineteenth-century texts, mostly in first editions.

The value of these  attempts has most often been in the suggestive and penetrating  things said by the way.  Such discussions help us very little to  enjoy what has been well done in art or poetry, to discriminate  between what is more and what is less excellent in them, or to use  words like beauty, excellence, art, poetry, with a more precise  meaning than they would otherwise have.  Beauty, like all other  qualities presented to human experience, is relative; and the  definition of it becomes unmeaning and useless in proportion to  its abstractness.  To define beauty, not in the most abstract but in  the most concrete terms possible, to find not its universal  formula, but the formula which expresses most adequately this or  that [viii] special manifestation of it, is the aim of the true student  of aesthetics.    \"To see the object as in itself it really is,\" has been justly said to  be the aim of all true criticism whatever, and in aesthetic  criticism the first step towards seeing one's object as it really is,  is to know one's own impression as it really is, to discriminate it,  to realise it distinctly.  The objects with which aesthetic criticism  deals--music, poetry, artistic and accomplished forms of human  life--are indeed receptacles of so many powers or forces: they  possess, like the products of nature, so many virtues or qualities.  What is this song or picture, this engaging personality presented  in life or in a book, to me?  What effect does it really produce on  me?  Does it give me pleasure?  and if so, what sort or degree of  pleasure?  How is my nature modified by its presence, and under  its influence?  The answers to these questions are the original  facts with which the aesthetic critic has to do; and, as in the study  of light, of morals, of number, one must realise such primary data  for one's self, or not at all.  And he who experiences these  impressions strongly, and drives directly at the discrimination  and analysis of them, has no need to trouble himself with the  abstract question what beauty is in itself, or what its exact  relation to truth or [ix] experience--metaphysical questions, as  unprofitable as metaphysical questions elsewhere.  He may pass  them all by as being, answerable or not, of no interest to him.    The aesthetic critic, then, regards all the objects with which he  has to do, all works of art, and the fairer forms of nature and  human life, as powers or forces producing pleasurable sensations,  each of a more or less peculiar or unique kind.  This influence he  feels, and wishes to explain, by analysing and reducing it to its  elements.  To him, the picture, the landscape, the engaging  personality in life or in a book, La Gioconda, the hills of Carrara,  Pico of Mirandola, are valuable for their virtues, as we say, in  speaking of a herb, a wine, a gem; for the property each has of  affecting one with a special, a unique, impression of pleasure.  Our education becomes complete in proportion as our  susceptibility to these impressions increases in depth and variety.  And the function of the aesthetic critic is to distinguish, to  analyse, and separate from its adjuncts, the virtue by which a  picture, a landscape, a fair personality in life or in a book,  produces this special impression of beauty or pleasure, to indicate  what the source of that impression is, and under what conditions  it is experienced.  His end is reached when he has disengaged that  [x] virtue, and noted it, as a chemist notes some natural element,  for himself and others; and the rule for those who would reach  this end is stated with great exactness in the words of a recent  critic of Sainte-Beuve:--De se borner à connaître de près les  belles choses, et à s'en nourrir en exquis amateurs, en  humanistes accomplis.    What is important, then, is not that the critic should possess a  correct abstract definition of beauty for the intellect, but a certain  kind of temperament, the power of being deeply moved by the  presence of beautiful objects.  He will remember always that  beauty exists in many forms.  To him all periods, types, schools  of taste, are in themselves equal.  In all ages there have been  some excellent workmen, and some excellent work done.  The  question he asks is always:--In whom did the stir, the genius, the  sentiment of the period find itself?  where was the receptacle of  its refinement, its elevation, its taste?  \"The ages are all equal,\"  says William Blake, \"but genius is always above its age.\"    Often it will require great nicety to disengage this virtue from the  commoner elements with which it may be found in combination.  Few artists, not Goethe or Byron even, work quite cleanly,  casting off all débris, and leaving us only what the heat of their  imagination has wholly [xi] fused and transformed.  Take, for  instance, the writings of Wordsworth.  The heat of his genius,  entering into the substance of his work, has crystallised a part,  but only a part, of it; and in that great mass of verse there is much  which might well be forgotten.  But scattered up and down it,  sometimes fusing and transforming entire compositions, like the  Stanzas on Resolution and Independence, or the Ode on the  Recollections of Childhood, sometimes, as if at random,  depositing a fine crystal here or there, in a matter it does not  wholly search through and transmute, we trace the action of his  unique, incommunicable faculty, that strange, mystical sense of a  life in natural things, and of man's life as a part of nature,  drawing strength and colour and character from local influences,  from the hills and streams, and from natural sights and sounds.  Well!  that is the virtue, the active principle in Wordsworth's  poetry; and then the function of the critic of Wordsworth is to  follow up that active principle, to disengage it, to mark the degree  in which it penetrates his verse.    The subjects of the following studies are taken from the history  of the Renaissance, and touch what I think the chief points in that  complex, many-sided movement.  I have explained in the first of  them what I understand by the word, [xii] giving it a much wider  scope than was intended by those who originally used it to denote  that revival of classical antiquity in the fifteenth century which  was only one of many results of a general excitement and  enlightening of the human mind, but of which the great aim and  achievements of what, as Christian art, is often falsely opposed to  the Renaissance, were another result.  This outbreak of the human  spirit may be traced far into the middle age itself, with its motives  already clearly pronounced, the care for physical beauty, the  worship of the body, the breaking down of those limits which the  religious system of the middle age imposed on the heart and the  imagination.  I have taken as an example of this movement, this  earlier Renaissance within the middle age itself, and as an  expression of its qualities, two little compositions in early  French; not because they constitute the best possible expression  of them, but because they help the unity of my series, inasmuch  as the Renaissance ends also in France, in French poetry, in a  phase of which the writings of Joachim du Bellay are in many  ways the most perfect illustration.  The Renaissance, in truth, put  forth in France an aftermath, a wonderful later growth, the  products of which have to the full that subtle and delicate  sweetness which belongs to a refined and comely [xiii]  decadence, just as its earliest phases have the freshness which  belongs to all periods of growth in art, the charm of ascêsis, of  the austere and serious girding of the loins in youth.    But it is in Italy, in the fifteenth century, that the interest of the  Renaissance mainly lies,--in that solemn fifteenth century which  can hardly be studied too much, not merely for its positive results  in the things of the intellect and the imagination, its concrete  works of art, its special and prominent"]]]
