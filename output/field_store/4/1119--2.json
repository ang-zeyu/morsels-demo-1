APPLETON AND COMPANY          PREFACE      The present work is not a compendium of astronomy or an outline course  of popular reading in that science. It has been prepared as a text-book,  and the author has purposely omitted from it much matter interesting as  well as important to a complete view of the science, and has endeavored  to concentrate attention upon those parts of the subject that possess  special educational value. From this point of view matter which permits  of experimental treatment with simple apparatus is of peculiar value and  is given a prominence in the text beyond its just due in a well-balanced  exposition of the elements of astronomy, while topics, such as the  results of spectrum analysis, which depend upon elaborate apparatus, are  in the experimental part of the work accorded much less space than their  intrinsic importance would justify.    Teacher and student are alike urged to magnify the observational side of  the subject and to strive to obtain in their work the maximum degree of  precision of which their apparatus is capable. The instruments required  are few and easily obtained. With exception of a watch and a protractor,  all of the apparatus needed may be built by any one of fair mechanical  talent who will follow the illustrations and descriptions of the text.  In order that proper opportunity for observations may be had, the study  should be pursued during the milder portion of the year, between April  and November in northern latitudes, using clear weather for a direct  study of the sky and cloudy days for book work.    The illustrations contained in the present work are worthy of as careful  study as is the text, and many of them are intended as an aid to  experimental work and accurate measurement, e. g., the star maps, the  diagrams of the planetary orbits, pictures of the moon, sun, etc. If the  school possesses a projection lantern, a set of astronomical slides to  be used in connection with it may be made of great advantage, if the  pictures are studied as an auxiliary to Nature. Mere display and scenic  effect are of little value.    A brief bibliography of popular literature upon astronomy may be found  at the end of this book, and it will be well if at least a part of these  works can be placed in the school library and systematically used for  supplementary reading. An added interest may be given to the study if  one or more of the popular periodicals which deal with astronomy are  taken regularly by the school and kept within easy reach of the  students. From time to time the teacher may well assign topics treated  in these periodicals to be read by individual students and presented to  the class in the form of an essay.    The author is under obligations to many of his professional friends who  have contributed illustrative matter for his text, and his thanks are in  an especial manner due to the editors of the Astrophysical Journal,  Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Popular Astronomy for permission to  reproduce here plates which have appeared in those periodicals, and to  Dr. Charles Boynton, who has kindly read and criticised the proofs.

ACCURATE MEASUREMENT.--Accurate measurement is the foundation of  exact science, and at the very beginning of his study in astronomy the  student should learn something of the astronomer's kind of measurement.  He should practice measuring the stars with all possible care, and  should seek to attain the most accurate results of which his instruments  and apparatus are capable. The ordinary affairs of life furnish abundant  illustration of some of these"]]]
