PREFACE.    As a rule the minor wars in which this country has been from time to  time engaged, have been remarkable both for the admirable way in which  they were conducted and for the success that attended them.  The two  campaigns in South Africa, however, that followed each other with but a  brief interval, were notable exceptions.  In the Zulu War the blunder,  made by the General in command, of dividing his army and marching away  with the greater portion without troubling himself to keep up  communication with the force left behind, brought about a serious  disaster at Isandula.  In the Boer War we also suffered two defeats,--  one at Laing's Neck, the other at Majuba Hill,--and when at last a  British force was assembled capable of retrieving these misfortunes, the  English government decided not to fight, but to leave the Boers in  possession of the Transvaal.  This unfortunate surrender has, assuredly,  brought about the troubled state of things now existing in South Africa.    After having written upwards of fifty records of almost unbroken success  to the British arms in almost all parts of the world, I have found it  painful to describe these two campaigns in which we suffered defeat.  I  trust, however, that this story will prove of great interest to the  reader because of the characteristic English pluck and daring of its  hero.    G.A.  Henty.    CHAPTER ONE.    A SNOW-DRIFT.    The country round Castleton, in Derbyshire, is greatly admired by summer  tourists, for it lies in the wildest part of that county; but in winter  the wind whistles sharply over the bleak hills--where there are no trees  to break its violence,--the sheep huddle under the shelter of the  roughly-built stone walls, and even lovers of the picturesque would at  that season prefer a more level and wooded country.  The farm of Mr  Humphreys was situated about a mile from Castleton.  It consisted of 100  acres or so of good land in the bottom, and of five or six times as much  upland grazing on the hills.  Mr Humphreys owned as well as farmed his  land, and so might have claimed, had he chosen, the title of  gentleman-farmer; but he himself would have scoffed at such an idea.  He  was a hard-working, practical farmer, about over his ground from morning  to night, save when the hounds met within easy distance in winter; then  he would mount \"Robin,\" who served alike as hunter, or hack, or to drive  in the neat dog-cart to Buxton market; and, although there were many  handsomer horses in the field, Mr Humphreys was seldom far off when the  fox was killed.    His family consisted of his wife and two sons, the eldest, Richard, was  about fourteen years old.  His brother, John, was three years younger.  Both went to school at Castleton.  The younger boy was fond of his  books; he had always been weak and delicate, and, being unable to spend  his time in active exercise out of doors, he was generally to be found  reading by the fire in winter, or lying on the ground in summer under a  tree in the orchard, with his chin on his hand, and the book before him.  Richard had no literary taste; he managed to scrape through his work  and keep a moderate place in his class, somewhere about half-way down;  but he threw his whole heart into outdoor exercise, and was one of the  best bats in the school, although there were many there older by years.  He knew every foot of the hills, could tell every bird by its note, and  knew all about their nests and eggs.  Except in school, or perhaps  during the long winter evenings, it was rare indeed to find Dick with a  book in his hand.    \"You will never set the Thames on fire, Dick,\" his father would say to  him.    \"I shall never want to, father,\" he would reply.  \"I do not see that  learning will ever be much good to me.\"    \"That is a foolish idea, Dick.  A great deal of the learning that boys  get at school is of no actual value in pounds, shillings, and pence.  It  is not the fact of knowing Latin, and Greek, and mathematics which  benefits a man; but it is the learning of them.  It is the discipline to  the mind, which is of benefit.  The mind is like the body.  There is no  use in cricket, or in boating, or in hunting, but these things  strengthen the body and make it active and healthy, and able to do  better everything which it undertakes, and it is exactly the same thing  with the mind; besides, the days are coming when farmers must farm their  land with science and intelligence, or they will be left behind in the  race.  We are being rivalled by the farmers of America.  Not only do we  have to pay rent, but by the tithes and rates and taxes they put upon us  government makes the English farmer pay a heavy tax upon every bushel of  corn he produces, while they allow the American corn to come into the  market tax-free.  This may be all right, but it does not appear fair to  me.  However, there it is, and we have got to meet it, and if we are to  keep our heads above water, it can only be by farming up to the very  best lights of the day.\"    \"Well, father,\" Dick said, \"then it seems to me that when we grow up,  John and I must farm together.  He shall be the scientific partner; I  will do the work.\"    \"That is all right enough, Dick, but you must have some science too,  else you and he will never get on.  You would want to go on in the  old-fashioned groove, and would call his ideas newfangled.  No, I intend  you, when you get old enough, to go to Cirencester College, where you  will learn the theory and science of farming thoroughly.  You will get  the practical part at home.  As to John, he is a child yet, and, I  trust, will grow up strong and active; but if his tastes remain as they  now are, I do not think it likely he will take to farming, and we must  find some other career for him.\"    One afternoon in the beginning of December two of Dick's school-fellows  said to him--    \"We are going over the hills to our uncle's farm, Dick.  Will you go  with us?\"    When there was nothing better to do, Dick was always ready for a walk,  and he at once agreed to accompany the Jacksons.  The elder boy was  about his own age, the younger two years his junior.    The Jacksons called for him directly he had finished his dinner, and  they started away together for a farm which was about four miles  distant.  They struck right across the hills, as it would have been two  miles longer by the nearest road.    \"I should not be surprised,\" Dick said, \"if it were to snow to-night; it  is bitterly cold, and the clouds look very heavy.\"    \"I hope it won't snow until we get back,\" James, the younger of the  brothers, remarked.    \"I don't know,\" Dick answered, looking at the clouds.  \"I should not be  surprised if it began at any moment.\"    The wind was blowing strongly.  The hills were high and steep, and,  although the boys made their best speed, it was considerably over an  hour before they reached the farm.  They had started at two, and it was  now a quarter past three.  Mr Jackson was out.  The boys delivered the  message with which they had been charged to their aunt.    \"Now,\" she said, \"I will cut you each a hunch of cake, and when you have  eaten that and had a glass of fresh milk you had best start at once.  It  is bitterly cold, and we are going to have snow: The sooner you are  home, the better.\"    The boys now ate their cake.  Mrs Jackson came to the door with them.  Then she said, as the first flake of snow fell--    \"I am not sure, boys, that you had not better stay here all night.\"    The boys laughed.    \"Why, what would they say at home?  They would just be in a way about  us.\"    \"Well, at any rate, you had better go by the road.\"    \"Oh, that is two miles farther at least.  We should not get home until  long after dark.  We shan't be an hour by the hills.  We know every foot  of the way.\"    \"Well, good-bye, then.  Make as much haste as you can.\"    For half a mile their way led along the road, then they scrambled over a  wall and began to ascend the barren hill-side.  The snow was falling  fast now.  Thicker and thicker it came down, and when, hot and panting,  they reached the top of the hill, the wind blew the flakes so fiercely  into their faces that they were half-blinded, and were obliged to turn  their backs to the gale while they got breath.  For half an hour they  struggled on.  They could scarcely see ten paces before them through the  driving snow, and in every sheltered spot white patches rapidly began to  form.    \"How different things look in a snow-storm!\"  Dick said, as they stopped  for breath and shelter under the lee of a wall.  \"I don't know, Tom, but  I am not quite sure that we are going straight; I do not know what wall  this is.\"    \"No more do I,\" Tom Jackson replied.  \"I felt quite sure that we were  going right at first, but somehow I don't think so now.\"    \"I wish the snow would stop for a minute,\" Dick said, \"just to let us  have a look round.  If I could see a hundred yards I am sure I should  know where we are.  What is the matter with you, James; what are you  blubbering about?\"    \"My feet are so cold; they hurt dreadfully.\"    \"Oh, never mind,\" Dick said.  \"Come, boys, push along, and we shall soon  be home.\"    Again they started with heads bent to face the storm.    \"It is getting dark awfully fast,\" Tom Jackson said.    \"It is, and no mistake.  Come, let us have a trot.  Come on, young one.\"    But, although Dick spoke hopefully, he was not as confident as he  appeared.  He was sure now that they had lost the way.

[Illustration]           ON     SNAKE-POISON.     ITS ACTION     AND     ITS ANTIDOTE.           BY     A. MUELLER, M.D.           SYDNEY:     L. BRUCK, MEDICAL PUBLISHER,   13 CASTLEREAGH STREET.   1893.           SYDNEY:   WEBDALE, SHOOSMITH & CO., PRINTERS,   117 CLARENCE STREET.     1893.          PREFACE.      Since the method of treating snakebite-poisoning by hypodermic  injections of strychnine, discovered by the writer and published but a  few years ago, has already been adopted by the medical profession  throughout the Australian colonies, and practised even by laymen in  cases of urgency with much success, it has been repeatedly suggested to  him that the subject calls for further elucidation at his hands; that  the morbid processes engendered by the snake venom and the _modus  operandi_ of the antidote should be explained by him in a manner  satisfying the demands of science, and at the same time within the grasp  of the intelligent, moderately educated layman. When the latter, in a  case of pressing emergency and in the absence of medical aid, is called  upon to administer a potent drug in heroic doses, the aggregate of which  would be attended by serious consequences in the absence of the deadly  ophidian virus, an intelligent insight alone into the process he is  about to initiate will give him that decision and promptitude of action,  on the full exercise of which on his part it may depend whether, within  a few hours, a valuable and to him probably dear life will be saved or  lost.    The foregoing applies, not to Australia only, but to all other countries  infested by venomous snakes. The introduction of the writer's method in  every one of these countries is merely a question of time, for  snake-poison acts everywhere according to one uniform principle, however  different the symptoms it produces may appear to the superficial  observer. The antidote, therefore, that cures snakebite in Australia  will as surely cure it elsewhere if properly and efficiently applied.    To his Australian confreres, more especially to those who adopted his  method but had to practise it more or less empirically, the writer also  owes a more elaborate explanation of his theory of the action of  snake-poison in all its bearings on the various nerve centres than is to  be found in the scattered writings he has from time to time published in  our periodical literature. His warmest thanks are due to them for the  records of cases they have furnished to the _Australasian Medical  Gazette_, and to the Hon. J. M. Creed, its able editor, for the ample  space he has invariably allotted to the subject, and the valuable  support he has given him throughout. By our united efforts we have  reared in a dark and hitherto barren field of research a column of solid  knowledge, and on this column Australia now occupies the highest and  will ever occupy the most prominent place.    Not the least pleasing feature in the history of this discovery is the  fact that it has been made without an elaborate series of experiments on  animals, that it is a peaceful conquest not attained by means of  doubtful justification, and which have hitherto invariably failed in  their object. This object--the discovery of the coveted  antidote--instead of being brought nearer, was, in fact, further removed  by every succeeding series of experiments. However fruitful in results  this mode of research has been in other domains, in this particular one  it has not only been a failure but an actual bar to progress. Nature  invariably refused to yield her secret when thus interrogated. The  tortured animals, like the victims of Torquemada, either did not answer  at all or they answered with a lie, and the baffled experimenter  abandoned his task in despair.    Still, these negative results notwithstanding, the writer is confronted  by a certain class of would-be rigorous scientists, who tell him that  his theory of the action of snake-poison, though it explains all the  phenomena, cannot be accepted as correct until it has been proven so by  strict test experiments on animals, and that the successful  administration of the antidote is proof only of the fact of neither  antidote nor snake-poison having killed the patients, who, probably,  might have recovered if left to themselves. This may be strict logic,  but common sense replies to it that if recovery takes place after proper  administration of the antidote in cases which, according to all our  previous experience, would have ended fatally, it is not illogical to  assume that antidote and recovery stand in the relation of cause and  effect. This sceptical attitude of the scientific mind can justly be  maintained only with regard to cases limited in number and in which the  symptoms left room for doubt as to their final result, but in view of  the formidable and constantly increasing records of cures from snakebite  during the last three years, it is, to say the least of it,  unreasonable.    The demand for experiments on animals, in proof of the correctness of  his theory, the writer does not feel called upon to satisfy, for, apart  from the theory proving itself by explaining all the symptoms the  snake-poison produces, it has also stood the test of practical  application. It is proven to be correct by the success of the antidote  to which it led, and which is the logical outcome of it. After finally  attaining a goal one has striven for, it is quite unnecessary to retrace  one's steps with a view of ascertaining whether the road that has led up  to it is the right and proper one.    By a fortuitous concurrence of circumstances, however, even this demand  for experiments shall be satisfied in these pages. The writer published  his theory of the action of snake-poison in May, 1888, after having  practised the strychnine treatment for some years and thoroughly  satisfied himself of its efficacy. In the latter part of 1888 accounts  of Feoktistow's researches reached this country. His final conclusions  to the effect that snake-poison is solely a nerve poison, that it does  not destroy protoplasm, and has no effect whatever on the blood to which  its destructive potency on animal life can be ascribed, were in  complete harmony with the writer's views, in fact, a re-statement of his  theory. It was a strange coincidence, or whatever it may be called,  that, independent of each other, at almost opposite parts of the globe,  and by opposite methods, we had arrived at almost identical conclusions.  Those of Feoktistow were drawn from 400 elaborate experiments on  animals, both vertebrates and invertebrates, made in the laboratory of  Professor Kobert at the University of Dorpat and in that of Professor  Owsjannikow at the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg. The  writer's conclusions, on the other hand, resulted entirely from a  careful and happy analysis of the symptoms observed at the bedside of  his patients suffering from snakebite. On one point only, but the most  important one, he differs from Feoktistow. The latter shared the fate of  all previous experimenters on animals. Though his experiments with  snake-poison led him to the correct theory of its action, and even to  the correct antidote, his experiments with strychnine and snake-poison  were a failure. The animals experimented on died, and, falling into the  error of his predecessors, mistaking the functional analogy that exists  between the nerve centres of the lower animals and those of man for  absolute identity, which does not exist, especially not when they are  under the influence of the two poisons, he concluded his researches with  the confession that a physiological antidote for snake-poison cannot  even be thought of at the present state of science. Although,  therefore, Feoktistow's labors would have led to no practical result,  they are, nevertheless, a most valuable contribution to science as being  the first to demonstrate the action of snake-poison on a strictly  scientific, experimental basis. For this reason, and with so high an  authority as Professor Kobert vouching for the correctness of the  experiments, they will be frequently quoted hereafter.    [Illustration]          HISTORICAL REVIEW.      Snakebite and its cure have always been the despair of medical science.  On no other subject has our knowledge remained for centuries so  unsatisfactory, fragmentary and empirical. The history of the subject,  in fact, may be summed up briefly as a series of vain and spasmodic  attempts to solve the problem of snakebite-poisoning and wring from  nature the coveted antidote.    Various and contradictory theories of the action of snake-poison have  been propounded, some absolutely erroneous, others containing a modicum  of truth mixed with a large proportion of error, but none but one  fulfilling the indispensable condition of accounting for all the  phenomena observable during the poisoning process and of reducing the  formidable array of conflicting symptoms to order by finding the law  that governs them all. We have the advocates of the blood-poison theory  ascribing the palpable nerve-symptoms to imaginary blood changes  produced by the subtle poison, and alleged to have been discovered by  the willing, but frequently deceiving microscope. Even bacteriology has  been laid under service and innocent leucocytes have been converted  under the microscope into deadly germs, introduced by the reptile,  multiplying with marvellous rapidity in the blood of its victims,  appropriating to themselves all the available oxygen and producing  carbonic acid, as the saccharomyces does in alcoholic fermentation.  Others again, and among them those supposed to be the highest  authorities on the subject now living, divide the honors between nerve  and blood.
