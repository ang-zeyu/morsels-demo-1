When the following Work was first published in America, in 1837, it  was but little known, and seemed to meet with little or no  encouragement. Months passed away, and very few copies were sold or  read. But, to the astonishment of the author, it worked itself into  notice more and more, by the blessing of God, and by virtue of its own  real merits; till, in two years, the first edition, consisting of  three thousand copies, was all sold, and many more were called for. A  new edition was published in 1839, consisting of two thousand five  hundred copies; these were also disposed of. Other three editions have  since been published, making in all thirteen thousand copies now  disposed of, and the demand is still increasing both in America and  Europe.    It has already found its way into most of the American States, and  into the provinces of the Canadas, as well as many parts of England,  Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. It has visited the cottages of the  humble, and the parlors of the great; and from the best information we  have on the subject, very few have risen from its perusal without a  deep and settled conviction of the truth of its principles.    The author has now in his possession the testimony of hundreds of  people, from different states and nations, all bearing witness that  this Work has been a means, in the hands of God, of saving them from  infidelity, from sectarian error and delusion, and of guiding them  into the light of TRUTH.    All these considerations, and an intense desire to impart the truth to  mankind as widely as possible, have induced the author to send forth  this new edition; which he greatly desires may prove a blessing to  thousands who are yet grovelling in darkness and superstition, and  lead them to the true fold of God.    If there be anything to admire, or anything praiseworthy in this Work,  the author has no claim to the honor or the praise; it is justly due  to Him who is the Source and Fountain of all TRUTH. The author was a  husbandman, inured to the plow--unpolished by education, untaught in  the schools of modern Sectarianism, (falsely called \"Divinity\")--  reared in the wilds of America, with a mind independent, untrammelled  and free. He drank of the pure fountain of Truth, unsullied and  unmixed, as it unfolded in majesty of light and splendor from the  opening heavens in all the simplicity of its nature. As such it has  flowed from his pen in the following volume; not veiled in mystery;  not dressed in the pomp of high-sounding names, and titles, and  learned terms; not adorned in the gay attire of eloquence flowing from  the imagination and the passions; but standing forth in the undress of  its own native modesty, as if conscious of the purity and innocence of  its nature.    He is indebted not only to the _Spirit_ of Truth for the principles  contained in this Work, but also to several men, who have been made  the instruments in the hands of God, to reveal the knowledge of God to  this generation, and to be the founders and leaders of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    Among the foremost of these, he would make honorable mention of  President Joseph Smith, by whose instrumentality most of these  glorious truths (so well known to the ancients) have been restored to  the knowledge of the world--and whose zeal, labors, sufferings, and  subsequent murder, will stand forth as a bright memorial to all  succeeding ages, and be celebrated by happy millions yet unborn.    With an assurance that the principles of this Work will yet prevail  over the whole earth, this new edition of the VOICE OF WARNING is now  sent forth; and should the author be called to sacrifice his life for  the cause of Truth, he will have the consolation that it will be said  of him, as it was said of Abel, viz: \"HE, BEING DEAD, YET SPEAKETH.\"                                                   PARLEY P. PRATT.    Manchester, England,      Dec. 4, 1846.          PREFACE    TO THE FIRST AMERICAN EDITION.    During the last nine years, the public mind has been constantly  agitated, more or less, through all parts of our country, with the cry  of \"Mormonism, Mormonism, Delusion, Imposture, Fanaticism,\" etc.,  chiefly through the instrumentality of the press. Many of the  newspapers of the day have been constantly teeming with  misrepresentations and slanders of the foulest kind, in order to  destroy the influence and character of an innocent society in its very  infancy; a society of whose real principles many of them know nothing  at all. Every species of wickedness has been resorted to, and all  manner of evil has been spoken against them falsely; insomuch, that in  many places, houses and ears are closed against them, without the  possibility of being heard for a moment.    Were this the only evil, we might have less cause of complaint; but in  consequence of this we have been assaulted by mobs, some of our houses  have been torn down or burned, our goods destroyed, and fields of  grain laid waste. Yea, more--some of us have been stoned, whipped, and  shot; our blood has been caused to flow, and still smokes to heaven,  because of our religious principles, in this our native land, the  boasted land of liberty and equal law! while we have sought in vain  for redress. Officers of state have been deaf to the voice of  Innocence, imploring at their feet for justice and protection in the  enjoyment of rights as American citizens.    Under these circumstances, what could be done? How were we to correct  the public mind? We were few in number, and our means of giving  information very limited; the columns of most of the papers were  closed against us, their popularity being at stake the moment our  principles were admitted. It is true we published a monthly paper, in  which our principles were clearly set forth; but its circulation was  limited to a few thousands. Under these circumstances, had we the  tongue of angels, and the zeal of Apostles, with our hearts expanded  wide as eternity, with the intelligence of heaven, and the love of God  burning in our bosoms; and commissioned to bear as joyful tidings as  ever were borne by Michael, the Archangel, from the regions of glory;  yet, it would have been as impossible for us to have communicated the  same to the public, as it was for Paul, when he stood in the midst of  Ephesus, to declare the glad tidings of a crucified and risen  Redeemer, when his voice was lost amid the universal cry of \"Great is  Diana of the Ephesians!\"    Go, lift your voice to the tumultuous waves of the ocean, or try to  reason amid the roar of cannon while the tumult of war is gathering  thick around, or speak to the howling tempest while it pours a deluge  over the plains; let your voice be heard amid the roar of chariots  rushing suddenly over the pavements; or, what is still less useful,  converse with a man who is lost in slumbers, or reason with a drunkard  while he reels to and fro under the influence of the intoxicating  poison, and those will convince you of the impossibility of  communicating truth to that soul who is willing to make up his  judgment upon popular rumor, or to be wafted gently down the current  of public opinion, without stopping for a moment to listen, to weigh,  to hear both sides of the question, and judge for himself.    One of the greatest obstacles in the way of the spread of truth, in  every age, is the tide of public opinion. Let one ray of light burst  upon the world in any age, and it is sure to come in contact with the  traditions and long-established usages of men, and their opinions; or  with some religious craft, so that, like the Ephesians, they counsel  together what shall be done; their great goddess will be spoken  against, her magnificence despised, her temple deserted; or, what is  still worse, their craft is in danger, for by this they have their  wealth. Call to mind the Apostles in contact with the Jewish Rabbis,  or with Gentile superstitions; in short, at war with every religious  establishment on the earth. Witness the popular clamor: \"If we let  them thus alone, all men will believe on them, and the Romans will  come and take away our place and nation.\" \"These men that turn the  world upside down have come hither also.\" \"What new doctrine is this,  for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears?\" \"These men do  exceedingly trouble our city, and teach customs which are not lawful  for us to receive, being Romans.\" \"What will this babbler say, he  seems to be a setter forth of strange gods?\" And many other such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35596"],[0,"Robt.

The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut apart by the  child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its proper place  throughout the book, pasted in the space containing the same number as  will be found under each picture on the sheet. It is not necessary to  cover the entire back of a picture with paste. Put it only on the  corners and place neatly within the lines you will find printed around  each space. Use photographic paste, if possible.    After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the  book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the  great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous  pages.    The book is then to be sewed by the child through the center with the  cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book thus becomes the child's  own book.    This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting  task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to  the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth  while.                       *       *       *       *       *    This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians includes at  present a book on each of the following:            Bach                  Grieg                 Mozart          Beethoven             Handel                Nevin          Brahms                Haydn                 Schubert          Chopin                Liszt                 Schumann          Dvorak                MacDowell             Tschaikowsky          Foster                Mendelssohn           Verdi                                                      Wagner                             [Illustration: Transcriber's note:         First page of illustrations: 1, 14, 15, 12, 11, 10, 13, 6]                             [Illustration: Transcriber's note:           Second page of illustrations: 7, 8, 16, 9, 5, 3, 4, 2]                                       Robt.

When Robert Schumann was a boy he used to amuse his friends by playing  their pictures on the piano. He could make the music imitate the person.    One day he said to them: This is the way the farmer walks when he comes  home singing from his work.                              [Illustration: No. 2                             THE HAPPY FARMER.]    Some day you will be able to play a lot of pieces by Schumann that  picture the pleasantest things so clearly that you can see them very  plainly indeed. In one of his books there is a music picture of a boy  riding a rocking horse.    Another of a little girl falling asleep.    _A March for Little Soldiers._ (That is, make-believes.)    And then there are _Sitting by the Fireside_, _What they Sing in  Church_, and a piece the first four notes of which spell the name of a  composer who was a good friend of Schumann's.    This composer came from Denmark.                              [Illustration: No. 3                                NIELS GADE.]    This is a picture of the house in Zwickau, Germany, where Robert  Schumann was born.                              [Illustration: No. 4                          SCHUMANN'S BIRTHPLACE.]    Schumann was a strong healthy youth who had many friends and loved life.                              [Illustration: No. 5                            SCHUMANN AS A YOUTH.]    What do you think the Father and Mother of Robert Schumann wanted him to  be when he was grown up?    A lawyer!    Robert was the youngest of five children, full of fun and up to all  kinds of games. He went to school and became especially fond of reading  plays.    He also loved to write little plays and to act them out on the stage  that his Father had built for him in his room. So he and his companions  could give their plays in their own theatre.    All the while Robert was taking piano lessons.    Just before he entered the High School he heard a pianist who played so  beautifully that he made up his mind that he would become a musician.    The pianist whose playing gave him this thought is one whose name you  will know better and better as you get older.                              [Illustration: No. 6                             IGNACE MOSCHELES.]    There was lots of music making in the Schumann home, for Robert and all  his companions played and sang. And besides that, he composed music for  them.    It must have been a pleasant picture to see all these German boys coming  together to make music. If we could gather together some American boys  who were alive at that same time, here are some we could have found:    Nathaniel Hawthorne, who wrote for children, _Tanglewood Tales_ and the  _Wonder Book_.                              [Illustration: No. 7                                HAWTHORNE.]    Then there was Longfellow, who was born in Portland, Maine. How many of  his poems do you know besides _Hiawatha_?                              [Illustration: No. 8                                LONGFELLOW.]    And then we must not forget Whittier, who wrote many lovely poems. One  was about a little girl who spelled the word that her companion missed  in school and so she went above him in the class.                              [Illustration: No. 9                                 WHITTIER.]    And still there was another little boy only a year older than Robert  Schumann. He was born in a cabin.                             [Illustration: No. 10                           LINCOLN'S BIRTHPLACE.]    This boy's name, as you can guess, was Abraham Lincoln.                             [Illustration: No. 11                             ABRAHAM LINCOLN.]    So when you think of Robert Schumann, let us also think of Hawthorne,  Longfellow, Whittier, and Lincoln.    They were all doing their best, even as boys, to be useful.    Well, after all, Robert Schumann did not become a lawyer. He studied  music very hard. His teacher was Frederick Wieck. His teacher's  daughter, Clara Wieck, played the piano very beautifully.                             [Illustration: No. 12                               CLARA WIECK.]    Papa Wieck, as he was called, was not very kind to Robert Schumann when  the young man confessed that he and Clara loved one another and wished  to marry.                             [Illustration: No. 13                             FRIEDRICH WIECK.]    But after a while it all turned out happily and they were married. So  Clara Wieck became Clara Schumann.    Here is a picture of them seated together.                             [Illustration: No. 14                        ROBERT AND CLARA SCHUMANN.]    In the sixteen years that Robert Schumann lived after he and Clara Wieck  were married he composed lots of music for the piano, besides songs,  symphonies, and other kinds of compositions.    He was a teacher in the Leipzig Conservatory. Among his friends were  Mendelssohn, Chopin, Brahms, and many others.    Schumann is best known as a composer of music, although he was also a  teacher, a conductor, and a writer upon musical subjects. For many years  he was the head of a musical newspaper, which is remembered to this day  because of the"]]]
