OUR KNOWLEDGE OF    THE EXTERNAL WORLD    AS A FIELD FOR SCIENTIFIC METHOD    IN PHILOSOPHY      BY    BERTRAND RUSSELL, F.R.S      LONDON: GEORGE ALLEN & UNWIN LTD    RUSKIN HOUSE, 40 MUSEUM STREET, W.C. 1        First published in 1914 by    The Open Court Publishing Company      Reissued by George Allen & Unwin Ltd.    1922          PREFACE      The following lectures[1] are an attempt to show, by means of examples,  the nature, capacity, and limitations of the logical-analytic method in  philosophy. This method, of which the first complete example is to be  found in the writings of Frege, has gradually, in the course of actual  research, increasingly forced itself upon me as something perfectly  definite, capable of embodiment in maxims, and adequate, in all branches  of philosophy, to yield whatever objective scientific knowledge it is  possible to obtain. Most of the methods hitherto practised have  professed to lead to more ambitious results than any that logical  analysis can claim to reach, but unfortunately these results have always  been such as many competent philosophers considered inadmissible.  Regarded merely as hypotheses and as aids to imagination, the great  systems of the past serve a very useful purpose, and are abundantly  worthy of study. But something different is required if philosophy is to  become a science, and to aim at results independent of the tastes and  temperament of the philosopher who advocates them. In what follows, I  have endeavoured to show, however imperfectly, the way by which I  believe that this _desideratum_ is to be found.      [1] Delivered as Lowell Lectures in Boston, in March and April 1914.    The central problem by which I have sought to illustrate method is the  problem of the relation between the crude data of sense and the space,  time, and matter of mathematical physics. I have been made aware of the  importance of this problem by my friend and collaborator Dr Whitehead,  to whom are due almost all the differences between the views advocated  here and those suggested in _The Problems of Philosophy_.[2] I owe to  him the definition of points, the suggestion for the treatment of  instants and \"things,\" and the whole conception of the world of physics  as a _construction_ rather than an _inference_. What is said on these  topics here is, in fact, a rough preliminary account of the more precise  results which he is giving in the fourth volume of our _Principia  Mathematica_.[3] It will be seen that if his way of dealing with these  topics is capable of being successfully carried through, a wholly new  light is thrown on the time-honoured controversies of realists and  idealists, and a method is obtained of solving all that is soluble in  their problem.      [2] London and New York, 1912 (\"Home University Library\").      [3] The first volume was published at Cambridge in 1910, the second in    1912, and the third in 1913.    The speculations of the past as to the reality or unreality of the world  of physics were baffled, at the outset, by the absence of any  satisfactory theory of the mathematical infinite. This difficulty has  been removed by the work of Georg Cantor. But the positive and detailed  solution of the problem by means of mathematical constructions based  upon sensible objects as data has only been rendered possible by the  growth of mathematical logic, without which it is practically impossible  to manipulate ideas of the requisite abstractness and complexity. This  aspect, which is somewhat obscured in a merely popular outline such as  is contained in the following lectures, will become plain as soon as Dr  Whitehead's work is published. In pure logic, which, however, will be  very briefly discussed in these lectures, I have had the benefit of  vitally important discoveries, not yet published, by my friend Mr Ludwig  Wittgenstein.    Since my purpose was to illustrate method, I have included much that is  tentative and incomplete, for it is not by the study of finished  structures alone that the manner of construction can be learnt. Except  in regard to such matters as Cantor's theory of infinity, no finality is  claimed for the theories suggested; but I believe that where they are  found to require modification, this will be discovered by substantially  the same method as that which at present makes them appear probable, and  it is on this ground that I ask the reader to be tolerant of their  incompleteness.

Ever since  Thales said that all is water, philosophers have been ready with glib  assertions about the sum-total of things; and equally glib denials have  come from other philosophers ever since Thales was contradicted by  Anaximander. I believe that the time has now arrived when this  unsatisfactory state of things can be brought to an end. In the  following course of lectures I shall try, chiefly by taking certain  special problems as examples, to indicate wherein the claims of  philosophers have been excessive, and why their achievements have not  been greater. The problems and the method of philosophy have, I believe,  been misconceived by all schools, many of its traditional problems being  insoluble with our means of knowledge, while other more neglected but  not less important problems can, by a more patient and more adequate  method, be solved with all the precision and certainty to which the most  advanced sciences have attained.    Among present-day philosophies, we may distinguish three principal  types, often combined in varying proportions by a single philosopher,  but in essence and tendency distinct. The first of these, which I shall  call the classical tradition, descends in the main from Kant and Hegel;  it represents the attempt to adapt to present needs the methods and  results of the great constructive philosophers from Plato downwards. The  second type, which may be called evolutionism, derived its predominance  from Darwin, and must be reckoned as having had Herbert Spencer for its  first philosophical representative; but in recent times it has become,  chiefly through William James and M. Bergson, far bolder and far more  searching in its innovations than it was in the hands of Herbert  Spencer. The third type, which may be called \"logical atomism\" for want  of a better name, has gradually crept into philosophy through the  critical scrutiny of mathematics. This type of philosophy, which is the  one that I wish to advocate, has not as yet many whole-hearted  adherents, but the \"new realism\" which owes its inception to Harvard is  very largely impregnated with its spirit. It represents, I believe, the  same kind of advance as was introduced into physics by Galileo: the  substitution of piecemeal, detailed, and verifiable results for large  untested generalities recommended only by a certain appeal to  imagination. But before we can understand the changes advocated by this  new philosophy, we must briefly examine and criticise the other two  types with which it has to contend.      A. The Classical Tradition    Twenty years ago, the classical tradition, having vanquished the  opposing tradition of the English empiricists, held almost unquestioned  sway in all Anglo-Saxon universities. At the present day, though it is  losing ground, many of the most prominent teachers still adhere to it.  In academic France, in spite of M. Bergson, it is far stronger than all  its opponents combined; and in Germany it has many vigorous advocates.  Nevertheless, it represents on the whole a decaying force, and it has  failed to adapt itself to the temper of the age. Its advocates are, in  the main, those whose extra-philosophical knowledge is literary, rather  than those who have felt the inspiration of science. There are, apart  from reasoned arguments, certain general intellectual forces against  it--the same general forces which are breaking down the other great  syntheses of the past, and making our age one of bewildered groping  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37101"],[0,"Humpback Whales in Glacier Bay National Monument, Alaska (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net                     U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE   National Technical Information Service     PB80-141559     HUMPBACK WHALES IN GLACIER BAY NATIONAL MONUMENT, ALASKA     MARINE MAMMAL COMMISSION   WASHINGTON, D.C.

In 1978, the whales entered the Bay  as usual, but left sooner than expected. The scientists conducting the  whale studies believed that the early departure of the whales was  precipitated by increased boat traffic in the Bay and, in 1979, the  Park Service, in consultation with the cruise ship industry, developed  and implemented operational guidelines for vessel course and speed in  designated areas, where it was felt that vessel interactions with  incoming whales could cause the most disturbance.    Researchers spent many hours looking for whales in the Bay during the  early part of the 1979 summer season, but few whales were seen.  Several interactions between vessels and those whales present in the  Bay were observed and, on one occasion, a whale known to have had an  interaction with a vessel left the Bay. Monument personnel discussed  the problem with the area office of the National Park Service. A  number of options, including emergency closure of the Bay were  considered. It was decided to provide funds for a more thorough  analysis of the available information on whale/vessel interactions,  and to consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service pursuant to  Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.    The NMFS was advised of the situation and, on 10 August 1979, NPS and  NMFS representatives met in Seattle, Washington to review available  information"]]]
