THE TREATY OF PEACE    \"The United States of America\"! It was in the Declaration of  Independence that this name was first and formally proclaimed to the  world, and to maintain its verity the war of the Revolution was fought.  Americans like to think that they were then assuming \"among the Powers  of the Earth the equal and independent Station to which the Laws  of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them\"; and, in view of their  subsequent marvelous development, they are inclined to add that it must  have been before an expectant world.    In these days of prosperity and national greatness it is hard to realize  that the achievement of independence did not place the United States on  a footing of equality with other countries and that, in fact, the new  state was more or less an unwelcome member of the world family. It is  nevertheless true that the latest comer into the family of nations  did not for a long time command the respect of the world. This lack  of respect was partly due to the character of the American population.  Along with the many estimable and excellent people who had come to  British North America inspired by the best of motives, there had come  others who were not regarded favorably by the governing classes of  Europe. Discontent is frequently a healthful sign and a forerunner of  progress, but it makes one an uncomfortable neighbor in a satisfied and  conservative community; and discontent was the underlying factor in  the migration from the Old World to the New. In any composite immigrant  population such as that of the United States there was bound to be a  large element of undesirables. Among those who came \"for conscience's  sake\" were the best type of religious protestants, but there were also  religious cranks from many countries, of almost every conceivable sect  and of no sect at all. Many of the newcomers were poor. It was common,  too, to regard colonies as inferior places of residence to which  objectionable persons might be encouraged to go and where the average  of the population was lowered by the influx of convicts and thousands of  slaves.    \"The great number of emigrants from Europe\"--wrote Thieriot, Saxon  Commissioner of Commerce to America, from Philadelphia in 1784--\"has  filled this place with worthless persons to such a degree that scarcely  a day passes without theft, robbery, or even assassination.\"* It would  perhaps be too much to say that the people of the United States were  looked upon by the rest of the world as only half civilized, but  certainly they were regarded as of lower social standing and of inferior  quality, and many of them were known to be rough, uncultured, and  ignorant. Great Britain and Germany maintained American missionary  societies, not, as might perhaps be expected, for the benefit of the  Indian or negro, but for the poor, benighted colonists themselves; and  Great Britain refused to commission a minister to her former colonies  for nearly ten years after their independence had been recognized.         * Quoted by W. E. Lingelbach, \"History Teacher's Magazine,\"       March, 1913.      It is usually thought that the dregs of humiliation have been reached  when the rights of foreigners are not considered safe in a particular  country, so that another state insists upon establishing therein its own  tribunal for the trial of its citizens or subjects. Yet that is what the  French insisted upon in the United States, and they were supposed to be  especially friendly. They had had their own experience in America.  First the native Indian had appealed to their imagination. Then, at  an appropriate moment, they seemed to see in the Americans a living  embodiment of the philosophical theories of the time: they thought that  they had at last found \"the natural man\" of Rousseau and Voltaire;  they believed that they saw the social contract theory being worked  out before their very eyes. Nevertheless, in spite of this interest in  Americans, the French looked upon them as an inferior people over whom  they would have liked to exercise a sort of protectorate. To them the  Americans seemed to lack a proper knowledge of the amenities of life.  Commissioner Thieriot, describing the administration of justice in the  new republic, noticed that: \"A Frenchman, with the prejudices of his  country and accustomed to court sessions in which the officers have  imposing robes and a uniform that makes it impossible to recognize  them, smiles at seeing in the court room men dressed in street clothes,  simple, often quite common. He is astonished to see the public enter and  leave the court room freely, those who prefer even keeping their hats  on.\" Later he adds: \"It appears that the court of France wished to set  up a jurisdiction of its own on this continent for all matters involving  French subjects.\" France failed in this; but at the very time that  peace was under discussion Congress authorized Franklin to negotiate a  consular convention, ratified a few years later, according to which the  citizens of the United States and the subjects of the French King in  the country of the other should be tried by their respective consuls or  vice-consuls. Though this agreement was made reciprocal in its terms and  so saved appearances for the honor of the new nation, nevertheless  in submitting it to Congress John Jay clearly pointed out that it was  reciprocal in name rather than in substance, as there were few or no  Americans in France but an increasing number of Frenchmen in the United  States.    Such was the status of the new republic in the family of nations when  the time approached for the negotiation of a treaty of peace with the  mother country. The war really ended with the surrender of Cornwallis  at Yorktown in 1781. Yet even then the British were unwilling to concede  the independence of the revolted colonies. This refusal of recognition  was not merely a matter of pride; a division and a consequent weakening  of the empire was involved; to avoid this Great Britain seems to have  been willing to make any other concessions that were necessary. The  mother country sought to avoid disruption at all costs. But the time had  passed when any such adjustment might have been possible. The Americans  now flatly refused to treat of peace upon any footing except that of  independent equality. The British, being in no position to continue the  struggle, were obliged to yield and to declare in the first article of  the treaty of peace that \"His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the said  United States... to be free, sovereign, and independent states.\"    With France the relationship of the United States was clear and friendly  enough at the time. The American War of Independence had been brought  to a successful issue with the aid of France. In the treaty of alliance  which had been signed in 1781 had been agreed that neither France nor  the United States should, without the consent of the other, make peace  with Great Britain. More than that, in 1781, partly out of gratitude but  largely as a result of clever manipulation of factions in Congress by  the French Minister in Philadelphia, the Chevalier de la Luzerne, the  American peace commissioners had been instructed \"to make the most  candid and confidential communications upon all subjects to the  ministers of our generous ally, the King of France; to undertake nothing  in the negotiations for peace or truce without their knowledge and  concurrence; and ultimately to govern yourselves by their advice and  opinion.\"* If France had been actuated only by unselfish motives in  supporting the colonies in their revolt against Great Britain, these  instructions might have been acceptable and even advisable. But such was  not the case. France was working not so much with philanthropic purposes  or for sentimental reasons as for the restoration to her former position  of supremacy in Europe. Revenge upon England was only a part of a larger  plan of national aggrandizement.           * \"Secret Journals of Congress.\" June 15, 1781.      The treaty with France in 1778 had declared that war should be continued  until the independence of the United States had been established, and it  appeared as if that were the main purpose of the alliance. For her  own good reasons France had dragged Spain into the struggle. Spain,  of course, fought to cripple Great Britain and not to help the United  States. In return for this support France was pledged to assist Spain  in obtaining certain additions to her territory. In so far as these  additions related to North America, the interests of Spain and those  of the United States were far from being identical; in fact, they were  frequently in direct opposition. Spain was already in possession of  Louisiana and, by prompt action on her entry into the war in 1780, she  had succeeded in getting control of eastern Louisiana and of practically  all the Floridas except St. Augustine. To consolidate these holdings  and round out her American empire, Spain would have liked to obtain  the title to all the land between the Alleghany Mountains and the  Mississippi. Failing this, however, she seemed to prefer that"]]]
