BOOK III.                     BOLOGNESE SCHOOL.      During the progress of the present work, it has been observed that the fame  of the art, in common with that of letters and of arms, has been  transferred from place to place; and that wherever it fixed its seat, its  influence tended to the perfection of some branch of painting, which by  preceding artists had been less studied, or less understood. Towards the  close of the sixteenth century, indeed, there seemed not to be left in  nature, any kind of beauty, in its outward forms or aspect, that had not  been admired and represented by some great master; insomuch that the  artist, however ambitious, was compelled, as an imitator of nature, to  become, likewise, an imitator of the best masters; while the discovery of  new styles depended upon a more or less skilful combination of the old.  Thus the sole career that remained open for the display of human genius was  that of imitation; as it appeared impossible to design figures more  masterly than those of Bonarruoti or Da Vinci, to express them with more  grace than Raffaello, with more animated colours than those of Titian, with  more lively motions than those of Tintoretto, or to give them a richer  drapery and ornaments than Paul Veronese; to present them to the eye at  every degree of distance, and in perspective, with more art, more fulness,  and more enchanting power than fell to the genius of Coreggio. Accordingly  the path of imitation was at that time pursued by every school, though with  very little method. Each of these was almost wholly subservient to its  prototype; nor was it distinguished in any other portion of the art than  that by which its master had surpassed all competitors. Even in this  portion, the distinction of these followers consisted only in copying the  same figures, and executing them in a more hasty and capricious manner, or  at all events, in adapting them out of place. Those devoted to Raffaello  were sure to exaggerate the ideal in every picture: the same in regard to  anatomy in those of Michelangiolo: while misplaced vivacity and  foreshortening were repeated in the most judicious historic pieces of the  Venetians and the Lombards.    A few, indeed, there were, as we have noticed, in every place, who rose  conspicuous above those popular prejudices and that ignorance which  obscured Italy, and whose aim was to select from the masters of different  states the chief merit of each; a method of which the Campi of Cremona more  especially furnished commendable examples. Yet these artists being unequal  in point of genius and learning, broken into different schools, separated  by private interests, accustomed to direct their pupils only in the exact  path they themselves trod, and always confined within the limits of their  native province, failed to instruct Italy, or at least to propagate the  method of correct and laudable imitation. This honour was reserved for  Bologna, whose destiny was declared to be the art of teaching, as governing  was said to be that of Rome; and it was not the work of an academy, but of  a single house. Gifted with genius, intent upon attaining the secrets more  than the stipends of their art, and unanimous in their resolves, the family  of the Caracci discovered the true style of imitation. First, they  inculcated it through the neighbouring state of Romagna, whence it was  communicated to the rest of Italy; so that in a little while nearly the  whole country was filled with its reputation. The result of their learning  went to shew that the artist ought to divide his studies between nature and  art, and that he should alternately keep each in view, selecting only,  according to his natural talents and disposition, what was most enviable in  both. By such means, that school, which appeared last in the series that  flourished, became the first to instruct the age; and what it had acquired  from each it afterwards taught to all: a school which, until that period,  had assumed no form or character to distinguish it from others, but which  subsequently produced almost as many new manners, as the individuals of the  family and their pupils. The mind, like the pen, would gladly arrive at  that fortunate epoch; aiming at the most compendious ways to reach it, and  studiously avoiding whatever may impede or divert its course. Let Malvasia  exclaim against Vasari as much as he pleases: let him vent his indignation  upon his prints, in which Bagnacavallo appears with a goat's physiognomy,  when he was entitled to that of a gentleman: let him farther vituperate his  writings, in which Bolognese professors are either omitted, dismissed with  faint praise, or blamed, until one Mastro Amico and one Mastro Biagio fall  under his lash:--to attempt to reconcile or to aggravate such feuds will  form little part of my task. Concerning this author I have sufficiently  treated in other places; though I shall not scruple to correct, or to  supply his information in case oaf need, on the authority of several modern  writers.[1] Nor shall I fail to point out in Malvasia occasional errors in  sound criticism, which seem to have escaped him in the effervescence of  that bitter controversy. The reader will become aware of them even in the  first epoch; in treating which, agreeably to my own method, I shall  describe the origin and early progress of this eminent school. Together  with the Bolognese, I shall also give an account of many professors of  Romagna, reserving a few, however, for a place in the Ferrarese School, in  which they shone either as disciples or as masters.         Footnote 1: No Italian school has been described by abler       pens. The Co. Canon. Malvasia was a real man of letters; and       his life has been written by Crespi. His two volumes,       entitled _Felsina Pittrice_, will continue to supply an       abundance of valuable information, collected by the pupils       of the Caracci, to whom he was known, and by whom he was       assisted in this work; charged, however, with a degree of       patriotic zeal at times too fervid.         Crespi and Zanotti were his continuators, whose merits are       considered in the last epoch. To these volumes is added the       work entitled, \"Pitture, Sculture, e Architetture di       Bologna,\" of which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#1)"],[1,"EPICOENE; OR, THE SILENT WOMAN      By Ben Jonson            INTRODUCTION    THE greatest of English dramatists except Shakespeare, the first  literary dictator and poet-laureate, a writer of verse, prose,  satire, and criticism who most potently of all the men of his time  affected the subsequent course of English letters: such was Ben  Jonson, and as such his strong personality assumes an interest to  us almost unparalleled, at least in his age.    Ben Jonson came of the stock that was centuries after to give to  the world Thomas Carlyle; for Jonson's grandfather was of  Annandale, over the Solway, whence he migrated to England.  Jonson's father lost his estate under Queen Mary, \"having been cast  into prison and forfeited.\"  He entered the church, but died a  month before his illustrious son was born, leaving his widow and  child in poverty.  Jonson's birthplace was Westminster, and the  time of his birth early in 1573.  He was thus nearly ten years  Shakespeare's junior, and less well off, if a trifle better born.  But Jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage.  His  mother married beneath her, a wright or bricklayer, and Jonson was  for a time apprenticed to the trade.  As a youth he attracted the  attention of the famous antiquary, William Camden, then usher at  Westminster School, and there the poet laid the solid foundations  of his classical learning.  Jonson always held Camden in  veneration, acknowledging that to him he owed,    \"All that I am in arts, all that I know;\"    and dedicating his first dramatic success, \"Every Man in His  Humour,\" to him.  It is doubtful whether Jonson ever went to either  university, though Fuller says that he was \"statutably admitted  into St. John's College, Cambridge.\"  He tells us that he took no  degree, but was later \"Master of Arts in both the universities, by  their favour, not his study.\"  When a mere youth Jonson enlisted as  a soldier, trailing his pike in Flanders in the protracted wars of  William the Silent against the Spanish.  Jonson was a large and  raw-boned lad; he became by his own account in time exceedingly  bulky.  In chat with his friend William Drummond of Hawthornden,  Jonson told how \"in his service in the Low Countries he had, in the  face of both the camps, killed an enemy, and taken opima spolia  from him;\" and how \"since his coming to England, being appealed to  the fields, he had killed his adversary which had hurt him in the  arm and whose sword was ten inches longer than his.\"  Jonson's  reach may have made up for the lack of his sword; certainly his  prowess lost nothing in the telling.  Obviously Jonson was brave,  combative, and not averse to talking of himself and his doings.    In 1592, Jonson returned from abroad penniless.  Soon after he  married, almost as early and quite as imprudently as Shakespeare.  He told Drummond curtly that \"his wife was a shrew, yet honest\";  for some years he lived apart from her in the household of Lord  Albany.  Yet two touching epitaphs among Jonson's \"Epigrams,\" \"On  my first daughter,\" and \"On my first son,\" attest the warmth of the  poet's family affections.  The daughter died in infancy, the son of  the plague; another son grew up to manhood little credit to his  father whom he survived.  We know nothing beyond this of Jonson's  domestic life.    How soon Jonson drifted into what we now call grandly \"the  theatrical profession\" we do not know.  In 1593, Marlowe made his  tragic exit from life, and Greene, Shakespeare's other rival on the  popular stage, had preceded Marlowe in an equally miserable death  the year before.  Shakespeare already had the running to himself.  Jonson appears first in the employment of Philip Henslowe, the  exploiter of several troupes of players, manager, and father-in-law  of the famous actor, Edward Alleyn.  From entries in \"Henslowe's  Diary,\" a species of theatrical account book which has been handed  down to us, we know that Jonson was connected with the Admiral's  men; for he borrowed 4 pounds of Henslowe, July 28, 1597, paying  back 3s. 9d. on the same day on account of his \"share\" (in what is  not altogether clear); while later, on December 3, of the same  year, Henslowe advanced 20s. to him \"upon a book which he showed  the plot unto the company which he promised to deliver unto the  company at Christmas next.\"  In the next August Jonson was in  collaboration with Chettle and Porter in a play called \"Hot Anger  Soon Cold.\"  All this points to an association with Henslowe of  some duration, as no mere tyro would be thus paid in advance upon  mere promise.  From allusions in Dekker's play, \"Satiromastix,\" it  appears that Jonson, like Shakespeare, began life as an actor, and  that he \"ambled in a leather pitch by a play-wagon\" taking at one  time the part of Hieronimo in Kyd's famous play, \"The Spanish  Tragedy.\"  By the beginning of 1598, Jonson, though still in needy  circumstances, had begun to receive recognition.  Francis Meres --  well known for his \"Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with  the Greek, Latin, and Italian Poets,\" printed in 1598, and for his  mention therein of a dozen plays of Shakespeare by title -- accords  to Ben Jonson a place as one of \"our best in tragedy,\" a matter of  some surprise, as no known tragedy of Jonson from so early a date  has come down to us.  That Jonson was at work on tragedy, however,  is proved by the entries in Henslowe of at least three tragedies,  now lost, in which he had a hand.  These are \"Page of Plymouth,\"  \"King Robert II. of Scotland,\" and \"Richard Crookback.\"  But all of  these came later, on his return to Henslowe, and range from August  1599 to June 1602.    Returning to the autumn of 1598, an event now happened to sever for  a time Jonson's relations with Henslowe.  In a letter to Alleyn,  dated September 26 of that year, Henslowe writes: \"I have lost one  of my company that hurteth me greatly; that is Gabriel [Spencer],  for he is slain in Hogsden fields by the hands of Benjamin Jonson,  bricklayer.\"  The last word is perhaps Henslowe's thrust at Jonson  in his displeasure rather than a designation of his actual  continuance at his trade up to this time.  It is fair to Jonson to  remark however, that his adversary appears to have been a notorious  fire-eater who had shortly before killed one Feeke in a similar  squabble.  Duelling was a frequent occurrence of the time among  gentlemen and the nobility; it was an impudent breach of the peace  on the part of a player.  This duel is the one which Jonson  described years after to Drummond, and for it Jonson was duly  arraigned at Old Bailey, tried, and convicted.  He was sent to  prison and such goods and chattels as he had \"were forfeited.\"  It  is a thought to give one pause that, but for the ancient law  permitting convicted felons to plead, as it was called, the benefit  of clergy, Jonson might have been hanged for this deed.  The  circumstance that the poet could read and write saved him; and he  received only a brand of the letter \"T,\" for Tyburn, on his left  thumb.  While in jail Jonson became a Roman Catholic; but he  returned to the faith of the Church of England a dozen years later.    On his release, in disgrace with Henslowe and his former  associates, Jonson offered his services as a playwright to  Henslowe's rivals, the Lord Chamberlain's company, in which  Shakespeare was a prominent shareholder.  A tradition of long  standing, though not susceptible of proof in a court of law,  narrates that Jonson had submitted the manuscript of \"Every Man in  His Humour\" to the Chamberlain's men and had received from the  company a refusal; that Shakespeare called him back, read the play  himself, and at once accepted it.  Whether this story is true or  not, certain it is that \"Every Man in His Humour\" was accepted by  Shakespeare's company and acted for the first time in 1598, with  Shakespeare taking a part.  The evidence of this is contained in  the list of actors prefixed to the comedy in the folio of Jonson's  works, 1616.  But it is a mistake to infer, because Shakespeare's  name stands first in the list of actors and the elder Kno'well  first in the dramatis personae, that Shakespeare took that  particular part.  The order of a list of Elizabethan players was  generally that of their importance or priority as shareholders in  the company and seldom if ever corresponded to the list of  characters.    \"Every Man in His Humour\" was an immediate success, and with it  Jonson's reputation as one of the leading dramatists of his time  was established once and for all.  This could have been by no means  Jonson's earliest comedy, and we have just learned that he was  already reputed one of \"our best in tragedy.\"  Indeed, one of  Jonson's extant comedies, \"The Case is Altered,\" but one never  claimed by him or published as his, must certainly have preceded  \"Every Man in His Humour\" on the stage.  The former play may be  described as a comedy modelled on the Latin plays of Plautus.  (It  combines, in fact, situations derived from the \"Captivi\" and the  \"Aulularia\" of that dramatist).  But the pretty story of the  beggar-maiden, Rachel, and her suitors, Jonson found, not among the  classics, but in the ideals of romantic love which Shakespeare had  already popularised on the stage.  Jonson never again produced so  fresh and lovable a feminine personage as Rachel, although in other  respects \"The Case is Altered\" is not a conspicuous play, and, save  for the satirising of Antony Munday in the person of Antonio  Balladino and Gabriel Harvey as well, is perhaps the least  characteristic of the comedies of Jonson.    \"Every Man in His Humour,\" probably first acted late in the summer  of 1598 and at the Curtain, is commonly regarded as an epoch-making  play; and this view is not unjustified.  As to plot, it tells  little more than how an intercepted letter enabled a father to  follow his supposedly studious son to London, and there observe his "]]]
