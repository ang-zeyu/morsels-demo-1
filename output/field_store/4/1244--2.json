Each page  was cut out of the original book with an X-acto knife and fed into an  Automatic Document Feeder Scanner to make this e-text, so the original  book was disbinded in order to save it.    Some adaptations from the original text were made while formatting it  for an e-text. Italics in the original book are capitalized in  this e-text. The original spellings of words are preserved, such as  \"connexion\" for \"connection,\" \"labour\" for \"labor,\" etc. Original  footnotes are put in brackets \"[]\" at the points where they are cited in  the text.

But not finding it  successful, he was sensible of his error in going to the press too  early, and he cast the whole anew in the following pieces, where some  negligences in his former reasoning and more in the expression, are,  he hopes, corrected. Yet several writers who have honoured the Author's  Philosophy with answers, have taken care to direct all their batteries  against that juvenile work, which the author never acknowledged, and  have affected to triumph in any advantages, which, they imagined, they  had obtained over it: A practice very contrary to all rules of candour  and fair-dealing, and a strong instance of those polemical artifices  which a bigotted zeal thinks itself authorized to employ. Henceforth,  the Author desires, that the following Pieces may alone be regarded as  containing his philosophical sentiments and principles.          CONTENTS PAGE          I.

Of Some Verbal Disputes            AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE PRINCIPLES OF MORALS          SECTION I. OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MORALS.        DISPUTES with men, pertinaciously obstinate in their principles, are,  of all others, the most irksome; except, perhaps, those with persons,  entirely disingenuous, who really do not believe the opinions they  defend, but engage in the controversy, from affectation, from a spirit  of opposition, or from a desire of showing wit and ingenuity, superior  to the rest of mankind. The same blind adherence to their own arguments  is to be expected in both; the same contempt of their antagonists; and  the same passionate vehemence, in inforcing sophistry and falsehood.  And as reasoning is not the source, whence either disputant derives his  tenets; it is in vain to expect, that any logic, which speaks not to the  affections, will ever engage him to embrace sounder principles.    Those who have denied the reality of moral distinctions, may be ranked  among the disingenuous disputants; nor is it conceivable, that any human  creature could ever seriously believe, that all characters and actions  were alike entitled to the affection and regard of everyone. The  difference, which nature has placed between one man and another, is  so wide, and this difference is still so much farther widened, by  education, example, and habit, that, where the opposite extremes come at  once under our apprehension, there is no scepticism so scrupulous,  and scarce any assurance so determined, as absolutely to deny all  distinction between them. Let a man's insensibility be ever so great,  he must often be touched with the images of Right and Wrong; and let  his prejudices be ever so obstinate, he must observe, that others are  susceptible of like impressions. The only way, therefore, of converting  an antagonist of this kind, is to leave him to himself. For, finding  that nobody keeps up the controversy with him, it is probable he will,  at last, of himself, from mere weariness, come over to the side of  common sense and reason.    There has been a controversy started of late, much better worth  examination, concerning the general foundation of Morals; whether  they be derived from Reason, or from Sentiment; whether we attain  the knowledge of them by a chain of argument and induction, or by an  immediate feeling and finer internal sense; whether, like all sound  judgement of truth and falsehood, they should be the same to every  rational intelligent being; or whether, like the perception of beauty  and deformity, they be founded entirely on the particular fabric and  constitution of the human species.    The ancient philosophers, though they often affirm, that virtue is  nothing but conformity to reason, yet, in general, seem to consider  morals as deriving their existence from taste and sentiment. On the  other hand, our modern enquirers, though they also talk much of the  beauty of virtue, and deformity of vice, yet have commonly endeavoured  to account for these distinctions by metaphysical reasonings, and by  deductions from the most abstract principles of the understanding. Such  confusion reigned in these subjects, that an opposition of the greatest  consequence could prevail between one system and another, and even in  the parts of almost each individual system; and yet nobody, till very  lately, was ever sensible of it. The elegant Lord Shaftesbury, who first  gave occasion to remark this distinction, and who, in general, adhered  to the principles of the ancients, is not, himself, entirely free from  the same confusion.    It must be acknowledged, that both sides of the question are susceptible  of specious arguments. Moral distinctions, it may be said, are  discernible by pure reason: else, whence the many disputes that reign in  common life, as well as in philosophy, with regard to this subject: the  long chain of proofs often produced on both sides; the examples cited,  the authorities appealed to, the analogies employed, the fallacies  detected, the inferences drawn, and the several conclusions adjusted to  their proper principles. Truth is disputable; not taste: what exists  in the nature of things is the standard of our judgement; what each  man feels within himself is the standard of sentiment. Propositions in  geometry may be proved, systems in physics may be controverted; but the  harmony of verse, the tenderness of passion, the brilliancy of wit, must  give immediate pleasure. No man reasons concerning another's beauty; but  frequently concerning the justice or injustice of his actions. In every  criminal trial the first object of the prisoner is to disprove the facts  alleged, and deny the actions imputed to him: the second to prove, that,  even if these actions were real, they might be justified, as innocent  and lawful. It is confessedly by deductions of the understanding, that  the first point is ascertained: how can we suppose that a different  faculty of the mind is employed in fixing the other? On the other hand,  those who would resolve all moral determinations into sentiment,  may endeavour to show, that it is impossible for reason ever to draw  conclusions of this nature. To virtue, say they, it belongs to be  amiable, and vice odious. This forms their very nature or essence. But  can reason or argumentation distribute these different epithets to any  subjects, and pronounce beforehand, that this must produce love,  and that hatred? Or what other reason can we ever assign for these  affections, but the original fabric and formation of the human mind,  which is naturally adapted to receive them?    The end of all moral speculations is to teach us our duty; and, by  proper representations of the deformity of vice and beauty of virtue,  beget correspondent habits, and engage us to avoid the one, and  embrace the other. But is this ever to be expected from inferences and  conclusions of the understanding, which of themselves have no hold of  the affections or set in motion the active powers of men? They discover  truths: but where the truths which they discover are indifferent, and  beget no desire or aversion, they can have no influence on conduct and  behaviour. What is honourable, what is fair, what is becoming, what is  noble, what is generous, takes possession of the heart, and animates us  to embrace and maintain it. What is intelligible, what is evident,  what is probable, what is true, procures only the cool assent of the  understanding; and gratifying a speculative curiosity, puts an end to  our researches.    Extinguish all the warm feelings and prepossessions in favour of virtue,  and all disgust or aversion to vice: render men totally indifferent  towards these distinctions; and morality is no longer a practical study,  nor has any tendency to regulate our lives and actions.    These arguments on each side (and many more might be produced) are so  plausible, that I am apt to suspect, they may, the one as well as the  other, be solid and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43282"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.No. 6.

Our engraving, which represents a portion of the park at the Paris  Exhibition grounds, needs little mention beyond that it is one of those  delightful retreats so refreshing to the weary visitor, who, tired out  with tramping about the buildings and grounds, is only too pleased to  refresh his eyes with some of that exquisite miniature water scenery  which is scattered about the grounds. We take our illustration from the  London _Graphic_.           *       *       *       *       *                           =Improvements in Silk Worm Breeding.=    _Galignani_ states that a very curious discovery has just been made,  which, if found as practicable in application as it seems to promise,  may create a very considerable change in the production of silk. It is  nothing more nor less than the possibility of obtaining two yields in  the year of the raw material instead of one, as at present. The moth  lays its eggs in May or June, and these do not hatch before the spring  of the following year. But sometimes they are observed to hatch  spontaneously ten or twelve days after they are laid. It was such a  circumstance as this coming to the attention of M. Ducloux, Professor of  the Faculty of Sciences at Lyons, that led him to undertake a series of  experiments on the subject, by means of which he has found that this  premature hatching can be produced at will. The means for effecting the  object are very simple--rubbing the eggs with a hair brush, subjecting  them to the action of electricity, or more surely still by dipping them  for half a minute in concentrated sulphuric acid. M. Bolle, who has also  turned his attention to the same subject, states that the same effect is  produced by hydrochloric, nitric, or even acetic and tartaric acid.  Finally, a submersion of a few seconds in water heated to 50 deg. Cent.  (122 deg. Fah.) is equally efficacious. However, M. Ducloux states that the  operation must be performed while the eggs are quite young, the second  or third day at the outside. When this new hatching is accomplished the  mulberry tree is in its full vigor, and the weather so favorable that  the rearing of the worm is liable to much less risk than during the  early days of spring, when the sudden atmospheric changes are very  detrimental, and frequently fatal to the growing caterpillars.           *       *       *       *       *                             =The Natural History of the Eel.=    According to the reports of shad fishermen, the chief enemy of the shad  is the eel, which not only follows that fish up the streams and devours  the spawn, but often attacks the shad after they are caught in the nets.  Entering the shad at the gill openings the eels suck out the spawn and  entrails, and leave the fish perfectly clean. The finest and fattest  shad are the ones selected. It is a curious circumstance that of a fish  so well known as the eel so many of its life habits should be in  dispute. An animated discussion has been going on in Germany quite  recently with regard to the natural history of this fish, and in a late  number of a scientific journal the following points are set down as  pretty well substantiated. Though a fresh water fish which passes the  greater part of its life in rivers, the eel spawns in the sea. That it  is viviparous is extremely improbable. The eel found in the upper waters  of rivers is almost always female. At the age of four years it goes down  to the sea to spawn and never returns to fresh water. The spawning  process is somehow dangerous to the eel, thousands being found dead near  the mouths of rivers, with their ovaries empty. The descent of the fish  to the sea does not appear to take place at any definite period, but is  probably dependent on the season for spawning. The male is always much  smaller than the female, and never exceeds half a yard in length. The  males never ascend to the head waters of rivers, but keep continually in  the sea or in the lower reaches of the river. Nothing is definitely  known about the spawning season, though it is probable that the eggs are  deposited in the sea not far from the mouths of rivers.           *       *       *       *       *          [Illustration: THE PARIS EXHIBITION.--A SKETCH IN THE PARK.]           *       *       *       *       *          [Illustration: \"Scientific American.\" In Gothic script]                               Established 1845.
