DURRANT, M. RAYMOND LEE, AND  RICHARD M. HANSEN      UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS  LAWRENCE  1955          Additional Records and Extensions of  Known Ranges of Mammals From Utah    BY    STEPHEN D. DURRANT, M. RAYMOND LEE,  AND RICHARD M. HANSEN      The Museum of Zoology, University of Utah, contains approximately 5000  specimens in addition to those available to Durrant (1952) when he  prepared his account of the \"Mammals of Utah, _Taxonomy and  Distribution_.\" Study of this material discloses two kinds of mammals  not heretofore known to occur in Utah, and extends the known limits of  occurrence of many others as is set forth below in what may be thought  of as a supplement to the aforementioned report of 1952.    Our study was financed in part by a grant from the National Science  Foundation.    _=Sorex vagrans obscurus=_ Merriam. Dusky Shrew.--Twelve specimens are  available from the Abajo Mountains and Elk Ridge, San Juan County,  Utah, as follows: North Creek, 6 mi. W Monticello, 8300 ft.; 1 mi. S  Twin Peaks, 9500 ft.; Kigalia R. S., 8000 ft.; and Gooseberry R. S.,  8250 ft. Previously, the only known specimens from east of the Colorado  River in Utah were from the La Sal Mountains in extreme eastern Grand  County and extreme northern San Juan County. These twelve specimens  extend the known area of occurrence of the species in Utah  approximately 80 miles to the south, and indicate that this shrew  occurs throughout the state in favorable habitats.    _=Sorex palustris navigator=_ (Baird). Water Shrew.--An individual was  observed by M. Raymond Lee at North Creek, seven miles west of  Monticello, Abajo Mountains, 8000 feet, San Juan County, on July 10,  1954. Usually we are extremely reluctant to record sight records, but  do so in this instance because the water shrew is so distinctive that  it can be readily recognized and because the occurrence extends the  known range approximately 80 miles southward in Utah. This individual  was observed at close range while swimming and foraging in North Creek,  and there can be no doubt of its identity.    _=Myotis yumanensis yumanensis=_ (H. Allen). Yuma Myotis.--Durrant  (1952:43) reported this subspecies from Utah on the authority of Hardy  (1941:289) who had specimens from two localities in extreme  southwestern Utah. Durrant (1952:41) referred specimen Number 6784,  from Willow Creek, 25 miles south of Ouray, Uintah County, to _Myotis  lucifugus carissima_. Restudy of this specimen reveals that it is  _Myotis yumanensis yumanensis_. This identification has been  corroborated by Dr. Philip H. Krutzsch, University of Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, and extends the known range of the subspecies _M. y.  yumanensis_ approximately 300 miles northeastward in Utah. See also  Krutzsch and Heppenstall (1955:126) who record specimens from 2 mi. SW  Jensen.    _=Myotis subulatus melanorhinus=_ (Merriam). Small-footed Myotis.--This  bat previously was known from only seven localities in Utah, which  indicated that it occurred in only the western and southern areas of  the state. Four additional records are now available from the following  localities: Logan Canyon Cave, 15 miles north of Logan, Cache County;  Weber College Campus, Ogden, Weber County; University of Utah Campus,  Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County; Six Mile Canyon, 3-1/2 miles east of  Sterling, Sanpete County. These occurrences extend the known range to  the eastward in Utah, and indicate a state-wide distribution. Specimens  of the subspecies _Myotis s. melanorhinus_ are recorded also from as  far north as Double Springs, Custer County, Idaho (Davis, 1939:117).    _=Pipestrellus hesperus hesperus=_ (H. Allen). Western  Pipistrelle.--Heretofore, the northernmost known specimens of this bat  from Utah were from Old Lincoln Highway, 18 miles southwest of Orr's  Ranch, Tooele County. Specimen Number 7531 is now available from cliffs  NE [3 mi.] Ogden, Weber County, and extends the known range of this  species in Utah approximately 100 miles northeastward. This pipistrelle  probably inhabits all of northern and northwestern Utah in suitable  habitats. This probability is supported by Davis' (1939:120) report of  a specimen from Salmon Creek, eight miles west of Rogerson, Twin Falls  County, Idaho. See also Krutzsch and Heppenstall (1955:127) who record  a specimen from, eastern Utah as far north as, Desert Springs which is  10 mi. SW Ouray, Uintah County.    _=Corynorhinus rafinesquii pallescens=_ Miller. Long-eared  Bat.--Formerly, the northernmost record of the long-eared bat in Utah  was from east of Springville, Utah County. Specimens are now available  from Goldhill, Tooele County, and from South Fork, Ogden River, Weber  County. Professor J. S. Stanford, Department of Zoology, Utah State  Agricultural College, informed us (by letter) that this bat is the  common cave bat in Logan Canyon, Cache County. This northern extension  of known area of occurrence of approximately 100 miles indicates that  it probably is state-wide in distribution in suitable habitats. It can  be inferred from Hall (1946:161) that the range of _C. r. intermedius_  in Nevada extended northeastward into northwestern Utah, and Davis  (1939:124) reported specimens from Bingham and Bannock counties, Idaho,  that he referred to the above mentioned subspecies. This led Stanford  to comment (_in litt._) that bats of this species from northern Utah in  Cache County might be _C. r. intermedius_. Insofar as we are aware, _C.  r. pallescens_ differs from _C. r. intermedius_ only in being slightly  paler. Our specimens from Goldhill and South Fork of the Ogden River  are not beyond the range of color of specimens from elsewhere in the  state that are referable to _C. r. pallescens_. Inasmuch as specimens  are not available from Logan Canyon, we deem it best pending the  acquisition of specimens from that locality to refer all members of  this species from Utah to the subspecies _C. r. pallescens_.    _=Marmota flaviventer nosophora=_ Howell. Yellow-bellied  Marmot.--Durrant (1952:101) did not indicate that any species of the  genus _Marmota_ occurred on the mountains within the basin of  Pleistocene Lake Bonneville. Furthermore, he commented (_op. cit._:502)  upon the dearth of sciurids within this basin. One specimen, No.  10,905, of the subspecies _M. f. nosophora_ has been taken from South  Willow Canyon, 10,000 feet, base of Deseret Peak, Stansbury Mountains,  Tooele County. This specimen is noteworthy not only in that it extends  the known range of this kind of mammal 50 miles to the west in Utah,  but in that it is well within the basin of the ancient lake. The marmot  is common in the Wasatch Mountains on the eastern mainland of Lake  Bonneville, but to date has not been found on the Oquirrh Mountains  immediately to the west. The Oquirrh Mountains are interposed between  the Stansbury and Wasatch mountains. The presence of the marmot on the  Stansbury Mountains indicates that it probably occurs also on the  Oquirrh Mountains.    _=Citellus beldingi crebrus=_ Hall. Belding Ground Squirrel.--Durrant  (1952:113) had only two specimens of this ground squirrel from  Standrod, Boxelder County. Additional specimens have been obtained from  the following localities in northwestern Boxelder County: Grouse Creek,  Park Valley, Grouse Creek Mountains, 12 miles northwest of Grouse  Creek, and Goose Creek. _C. b. crebrus_ now is known to inhabit all the  major drainages of the Raft River, Goose Creek, and Grouse Creek  mountains. In addition to extending the known area of occurrence of  this animal in Utah, these specimens prove also that this species is  not restricted to the Snake River Drainage as Durrant (1952:113)  supposed, but occurs also in the Great Basin Drainage.    _=Citellus richardsonii elegans=_ (Kennicott). Richardson Ground  Squirrel.--Recently, Hansen (1953:132) reported on specimens of this  species from Rich and Summit counties. Additional specimens are now  available from Highway 165 [2 mi. E Summit--Daggett Co. Line], 2 miles  south of Utah-Wyoming State Line; 5 miles west of Manila, and one mile  northeast of Manila (Carnegie Museum). These localities are in Daggett  County. The occurrence of these ground squirrels in Rich, Summit and  Daggett counties suggests that they occur along the entire northern  piedmont of the Uinta Mountains.    _=Citellus lateralis trepidus=_ (Taylor). Golden-mantled Ground  Squirrel.--Durrant (1952:126) estimated that practically all of the  area in Utah that is within the Great Basin might be included in the  range of this subspecies. Actually, he had specimens from only the Raft  River Mountains in northwestern Boxelder County. He included sight  records from the Deep Creek Mountains and from the Oquirrh Mountains.  Subsequently two specimens, numbers 7469A and 7470A, were obtained from  the Deep Creek Mountains. To date neither specimens nor subsequent  sight records have been obtained from the Oquirrh Mountains, and we are  of the opinion that Durrant erred, and that the golden-mantled ground  squirrel does not inhabit these mountains. Therefore, it seems at this  writing that this subspecies, in Utah, occurs only in the extreme  western and northwestern parts of the state in the Deep Creek and Raft  River mountains, and not within the basin of Pleistocene Lake  Bonneville as formerly supposed.    _=Eutamias umbrinus umbrinus=_ (J. A. Allen). Uinta Chipmunk.--Two  specimens, numbers 10,236 and 10,237, from the junction of Argyle and  Minnie Maud creeks, Carbon County, prove that members of this  subspecies occur on the West Tavaputs Plateau, which is outside the  range ascribed to this subspecies by White (1953"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31469"],[0,"The Shunned House (#1)"],[1,"Shunned House                            By H. P. LOVECRAFT       _A posthumous story of immense power, written by a master of weird     fiction--a tale of a revolting horror in the cellar of an old                         house in New England_          Howard Phillips Lovecraft died last March, at the height of his      career. Though only forty-six years of age, he had built up an      international reputation by the artistry and impeccable literary      craftsmanship of his weird tales; and he was regarded on both sides      of the Atlantic as probably the greatest contemporary master of      weird fiction. His ability to create and sustain a mood of brooding      dread and unnamable horror is nowhere better shown than in the      posthumous tale presented here: \"The Shunned House.\"      From even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent. Sometimes it  enters directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes it  relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places. The  latter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the ancient city of  Providence, where in the late forties Edgar Allan Poe used to sojourn  often during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted poetess, Mrs.  Whitman. Poe generally stopped at the Mansion House in Benefit  Street--the renamed Golden Ball Inn whose roof has sheltered Washington,  Jefferson, and Lafayette--and his favorite walk led northward along the  same street to Mrs. Whitman's home and the neighboring hillside  churchyard of St. John's, whose hidden expanse of Eighteenth Century  gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination.    Now the irony is this. In this walk, so many times repeated, the world's  greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass a  particular house on the eastern side of the street; a dingy, antiquated  structure perched on the abruptly rising side hill, with a great unkempt  yard dating from a time when the region was partly open country. It does  not appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it, nor is there any evidence  that he even noticed it. And yet that house, to the two persons in  possession of certain information, equals or outranks in horror the  wildest fantasy of the genius who so often passed it unknowingly, and  stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideous.    The house was--and for that matter still is--of a kind to attract the  attention of the curious. Originally a farm or semi-farm building, it  followed the average New England colonial lines of the middle Eighteenth  Century--the prosperous peaked-roof sort, with two stories and  dormerless attic, and with the Georgian doorway and interior panelling  dictated by the progress of taste at that time. It faced south, with one  gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill, and  the other exposed to the foundations toward the street. Its  construction, over a century and a half ago, had followed the grading  and straightening of the road in that especial vicinity; for Benefit  Street--at first called Back Street--was laid out as a lane winding  amongst the graveyards of the first settlers, and straightened only when  the removal of the bodies to the North Burial Ground made it decently  possible to cut through the old family plots.    At the start, the western wall had lain some twenty feet up a  precipitous lawn from the roadway; but a widening of the street at about  the time of the Revolution sheared off most of the intervening space,  exposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be made,  giving the deep cellar a street frontage with door and one window above  ground, close to the new line of public travel. When the sidewalk was  laid out a century ago the last of the intervening space was removed;  and Poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of dull gray  brick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of ten feet by  the antique shingled bulk of the house proper.    [Illustration: \"That awful door in Benefit Street which I had left  ajar.\"]    The farm-like ground extended back very deeply up the hill, almost to  Wheaton Street. The space south of the house, abutting on Benefit  Street, was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level, forming  a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp, mossy stone pierced by a  steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between canyon-like  surfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn, rheumy brick walks, and  neglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns, rusted kettles fallen  from tripods of knotty sticks, and similar paraphernalia set off the  weather-beaten front door with its broken fanlight, rotting Ionic  pilasters, and wormy triangular pediment.           *       *       *       *       *    What I heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that people  died there in alarmingly great numbers. That, I was told, was why the  original owners had moved out some twenty years after building the  place. It was plainly unhealthy, perhaps because of the dampness and  fungous growths in the cellar, the general sickish smell, the drafts of  the hallways, or the quality of the well and pump water. These things  were bad enough, and these were all that gained belief among the persons  whom I knew. Only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle, Doctor Elihu  Whipple, revealed to me at length the darker, vaguer surmises which  formed an undercurrent of folklore among old-time servants and humble  folk; surmises which never travelled far, and which were largely  forgotten when Providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting modern  population.    The general fact is, that the house was never regarded by the solid part  of the community as in any real sense \"haunted.\" There were no  widespread tales of rattling chains, cold currents of air, extinguished  lights, or faces at the window. Extremists sometimes said the house was  \"unlucky,\" but that is as far as even they went. What was really beyond  dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there; or more  accurately, _had_ died there, since after some peculiar happenings over  sixty years ago the building had become deserted through the sheer  impossibility of renting it. These persons were not all cut off suddenly  by any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously  sapped, so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to  weakness he may have naturally had. And those who did not die displayed  in varying degree a type of anemia or consumption, and sometimes a  decline of the mental faculties, which spoke ill for the salubriousness  of the building. Neighboring houses, it must be added, seemed entirely  free from the noxious quality.    This much I knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to show me  the notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous investigation.  In my childhood the shunned house was vacant, with barren, gnarled and  terrible old trees, long, queerly pale grass and nightmarishly misshapen  weeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered. We boys used  to overrun the place, and I can still recall my youthful terror not only  at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation, but at the  eldritch atmosphere and odor of the dilapidated house, whose unlocked  front door was often entered in quest of shudders. The small-paned  windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round  the precarious panelling, shaky interior shutters, peeling wall-paper,  falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered  furniture as still remained. The dust and cobwebs added their touch of  the fearful; and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascend  the ladder to the attic, a vast raftered length lighted only by small  blinking windows in the gable ends, and filled with a massed wreckage  of chests, chairs, and spinning-wheels which infinite years of deposit  had shrouded and festooned into monstrous and hellish shapes.    But after all, the attic was not the most terrible part of the house. It  was the dank, humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest repulsion  on us, even though it was wholly above ground on the street side, with  only a thin door and window-pierced brick wall to separate it from the  busy sidewalk. We scarcely knew whether to haunt it in spectral  fascination, or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our sanity. For  one thing, the bad odor of the house was strongest there; and for  another thing, we did not like the white fungous growths which  occasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earth  floor. Those fungi, grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard outside,  were truly horrible in their outlines; detestable parodies of toadstools  and Indian-pipes, whose like we had never seen in any other situation.  They rotted quickly, and at one stage became slightly phosphorescent; so  that nocturnal passers-by sometimes spoke of witch-fires glowing behind  the broken panes of the fetor-spreading windows.    We never--even in our wildest Halloween moods--visited this cellar  by night, but in some of our daytime visits could detect the  phosphorescence, especially when the day was dark and wet. There was  also a subtler thing we often thought we detected--a very strange thing  which was, however, merely suggestive at most. I refer to a sort of  cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor--a vague, shifting deposit of  mold or niter which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst the  sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen.  Once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny resemblance  to a doubled-up human figure, though generally no such kinship existed,  and often there was no whitish deposit whatever.    On a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally  strong, and when, in addition, I had fancied "]]]
