From its home among filth it visits dwellings and storerooms to pollute  and destroy human food.    It carries bubonic plague and many other diseases fatal to man and has  been responsible for more untimely deaths among human beings than all  the wars of history.    In the United States rats and mice each year destroy crops and other  property valued at over $200,000,000.    This destruction is equivalent to the gross earnings of an army of over  200,000 men.    On many a farm, if the grain eaten and wasted by rats and mice could be  sold, the proceeds would more than pay all the farmer's taxes.    The common brown rat breeds 6 to 10 times a year and produces an average  of 10 young at a litter. Young females breed when only three or four  months old.    At this rate a pair of rats, breeding uninterruptedly and without  deaths, would at the end of three years (18 generations) be increased to  359,709,482 individuals.    For centuries the world has been fighting rats without organization and  at the same time has been feeding them and building for them fortresses  for concealment. If we are to fight them on equal terms we must deny  them food and hiding places. We must organize and unite to rid  communities of these pests. The time to begin is now.

Losses from depredations of house rats amount to many millions of  dollars yearly--to more, in fact, than those from all other injurious  mammals combined. The common house mouse[1] and the brown rat[2] (fig.  1), too familiar to need description, are pests in nearly all parts of  the country; while two other kinds of house rats, known as the black  rat[3] and the roof rat,[4] are found within our borders.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Brown rat.]    Of these four introduced species--for none is native to America--the  brown rat is the most destructive, and, except the mouse, the most  numerous and most widely distributed. Brought to America just before  the Revolution, it has supplanted and nearly exterminated its less  robust relative the black rat; and in spite of the constant warfare of  man has extended its range and steadily increased in numbers. Its  dominance is due to its great fecundity and its ability to adapt itself  to all sorts of surroundings. It breeds (in the middle part of the  United States) six or more times a year and produces from 6 to 20 young  (average 10) in a litter. Females breed when only 3 or 4 months old.  Thus a pair, breeding uninterruptedly and without deaths, could in three  years (18 generations) produce a posterity of 359,709,480 individuals.  Mice and the black and roof rats produce smaller litters, but the period  of gestation, about 21 days, and the number of litters are the same for  all.    Rats and mice are practically omnivorous, feeding upon all kinds of  animal and vegetable matter. The brown rat makes its home in the open  field, the hedge row, and the river bank, as well as in stone walls,  piers, and all kinds of buildings. It destroys grains when newly  planted, while growing, and in the shock, stack, mow, crib, granary,  mill, elevator, or ship's hold, and also in the bin and feed trough. It  invades store and warehouse and destroys furs, laces, silks, carpets,  leather goods, and groceries. It attacks fruits, vegetables, and meats  in the markets, and destroys by pollution ten times as much as it  actually eats. It destroys eggs and young poultry, and eats the eggs and  young of song and game birds. It carries disease germs from house to  house and bubonic plague from city to city. It causes disastrous  conflagrations; floods houses by gnawing lead water pipes; ruins  artificial ponds and embankments by burrowing; and damages foundations,  floors, doors, and furnishings of dwellings.    Unlike the brown rat the black rat rarely migrates to the fields. It has  disappeared from most parts of the Northern States, but is occasionally  found in remote villages or farms. At our seaports it frequently arrives  on ships from abroad, but seldom becomes very numerous. The roof rat is  common in many parts of the South, where it is a persistent pest in cane  and rice fields. It maintains itself against the brown rat partly  because of its habit of living in trees. The common house mouse by no  means confines its activities to the inside of buildings, but is often  found in open fields, where its depredations in shock and stack are well  known.    Not only are mice and rats, especially the brown rat, a cause of  destruction and damage to property, but they are also a constant menace  to the health of man. It has been proved that they are the chief means  of perpetuating and transmitting bubonic plague and that they play  important roles in conveying other diseases to human beings. They are  parasites, without redeeming characteristics, and should everywhere be  routed and destroyed.          PROTECTION OF FOOD AND OTHER STORES FROM RATS AND MICE.      Past attempts to exterminate rats and mice have failed, not so much  because of lack of effective means as because of the neglect of  necessary precautions and the absence of concerted endeavors. We have  rendered our work abortive by continuing to provide subsistence and  hiding places for the animals. If these advantages are denied,  persistent and general use of the usual methods of destruction will  prove far more successful.      RAT-PROOF BUILDING.    First in importance, as a measure of rat repression, is the exclusion of  the animals from places where they find food and safe retreats for  rearing their young.    The best way to keep rats from buildings, whether in city or in country,  is to use cement in construction. As the advantages of this material are  coming to be generally understood, its use is rapidly extending to all  kinds of buildings. The processes of mixing and laying this material  require little skill or special knowledge, and workmen of ordinary  intelligence can successfully follow the plain directions contained in  handbooks of cement construction.[5]    Many modern public buildings are so constructed that rats can find no  lodgment in the walls or foundations, and yet in a few years, through  negligence, such buildings often become infested with the pests.  Sometimes drain pipes are left uncovered for hours at a time. Often  outer doors, especially those opening on alleys, are left ajar. A common  mistake is failure to screen basement windows which must be opened for  ventilation. However the intruders are admitted, when once inside they  intrench themselves behind furniture or stores, and are difficult to  dislodge. The addition of inner doors to vestibules is an important  precaution against rats. The lower edge of outer doors to public  buildings, especially markets, should be reinforced with light metal  plates to prevent the animals from gnawing through. Any opening left  around water, steam, or gas pipes, where they go through walls, should  be closed carefully with concrete to the full depth of the wall.    =Dwellings.=--In constructing dwelling houses the additional cost of  making the foundations rat-proof is slight compared with the advantages.  The cellar walls should have concrete footings, and the walls themselves  should be laid in cement mortar. The cellar floor should be of medium  rather than lean concrete. Even old cellars may be made rat-proof at  comparatively small expense. Rat holes may be permanently closed with a  mixture of cement, sand, and broken glass, or sharp bits of crockery or  stone.    On a foundation like the one described above, the walls of a wooden  dwelling also may be made rat-proof. The space between the sheathing and  lath, to the height of about a foot, should be filled with concrete.  Rats can not then gain access to the walls, and can enter the dwelling  only through doors or windows. Screening all basement and cellar windows  with wire netting is a most necessary precaution.    =Old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Canada Team at  http://www.pgdpcanada.net                      SANDERS OF THE RIVER      BY      EDGAR WALLACE      Author of \"Four Just Men,\" \"The Council of Justice,\" \"The Duke in the    Suburbs,\" etc.      WARD, LOCK & CO., LIMITED    LONDON AND MELBOURNE            POPULAR NOVELS    BY    EDGAR WALLACE      Published by    Ward, Lock & Co., Limited.      _In Various Editions._        SANDERS OF THE RIVER    BONES    BOSAMBO OF THE RIVER    BONES IN LONDON    THE KEEPERS OF THE KING'S PEACE    THE COUNCIL OF JUSTICE    THE DUKE IN THE SUBURBS    THE PEOPLE OF THE RIVER    DOWN UNDER DONOVAN    PRIVATE SELBY    THE ADMIRABLE CARFEW    THE MAN WHO BOUGHT LONDON    THE JUST MEN OF CORDOVA    THE SECRET HOUSE    KATE, PLUS TEN    LIEUTENANT BONES    THE ADVENTURES OF HEINE    JACK O' JUDGMENT    THE DAFFODIL MYSTERY    THE NINE BEARS    THE BOOK OF ALL POWER    MR.

CHAPTER I.      THE EDUCATION OF THE KING.      Mr. Commissioner Sanders had graduated to West Central Africa by such  easy stages that he did not realise when his acquaintance with the back  lands began. Long before he was called upon by the British Government to  keep a watchful eye upon some quarter of a million cannibal folk, who  ten years before had regarded white men as we regard the unicorn; he had  met the Basuto, the Zulu, the Fingo, the Pondo, Matabele, Mashona,  Barotse, Hottentot, and Bechuana. Then curiosity and interest took him  westward and northward, and he met the Angola folk, then northward to  the Congo, westward to the Masai, and finally, by way of the Pigmy  people, he came to his own land.    Now, there is a subtle difference between all these races, a difference  that only such men as Sanders know.    It is not necessarily a variety of colour, though some are brown and  some yellow, and some--a very few--jet black. The difference is in  character. By Sanders' code you trusted all natives up to the same  point, as you trust children, with a few notable exceptions. The Zulu  were men, the Basuto were men, yet childlike in their grave faith. The  black men who wore the fez were subtle, but trustworthy; but the browny  men of the Gold Coast, who talked English, wore European clothing, and  called one another \"Mr.,\" were Sanders' pet abomination.    Living so long with children of a larger growth, it follows that he  absorbed many of their childlike qualities. Once, on furlough in London,  a confidence trick was played on him, and only his natural honesty  pulled him out of a ridiculous scrape. For, when the gold-brick man  produced his dull metal ingot, all Sanders' moral nerves stood endways,  and he ran the confiding \"bunco steerer\" to the nearest station,  charging him, to the astonishment of a sorely-puzzled policeman, with  \"I.G.B.,\" which means illicit gold buying. Sanders did not doubt that  the ingot was gold, but he was equally certain that the gold was not  honestly come by. His surprise when he found that the \"gold\" was  gold-leaf imposed upon the lead of commerce was pathetic.    You may say of Sanders that he was a statesman, which means that he had  no exaggerated opinion of the value of individual human life. When he  saw a dead leaf on the plant of civilisation, he plucked it off, or a  weed growing with his \"flowers\" he pulled it up, not stopping to  consider the weed's equal right to life. When a man, whether he was  _capita_ or slave, by his bad example endangered the peace of his  country, Sanders fell upon him. In their unregenerate days, the Isisi  called him \"Ogani Isisi,\" which means \"The Little Butcher Bird,\" and  certainly in that time Sanders was prompt to hang. He governed a people  three hundred miles beyond the fringe of civilisation. Hesitation to  act, delay in awarding punishment, either of these two things would have  been mistaken for weakness amongst a people who had neither power to  reason, nor will to excuse, nor any large charity.    In the land which curves along the borders of Togo the people understand  punishment to mean pain and death, and nothing else counts. There was a  foolish Commissioner who was a great humanitarian, and he went up to  Akasava--which is the name of this land--and tried moral suasion.    It was a raiding palaver. Some of the people of Akasava had crossed the  river to Ochori and stolen women and goats, and I believe there was a  man or two killed, but that is unimportant. The goats and the women were  alive, and cried aloud for vengeance. They cried so loud that down at  headquarters they were heard and Mr. Commissioner Niceman--that was not  his name, but it will serve--went up to see what all the noise was  about. He found the Ochori people very angry, but more frightened.    \"If,\" said their spokesman, \"they will return our goats, they may keep  the women, because the goats are very valuable.\"    So Mr. Commissioner Niceman had a long, long palaver that lasted days  and days, with the chief of the Akasava people and his councillors, and  in the end moral suasion triumphed, and the people promised on a certain  day, at a certain hour, when the moon was in such a quarter and the tide  at such a height, the women should be returned and the goats also.    So Mr. Niceman returned to headquarters, swelling with admiration for  himself and wrote a long report about his genius and his administrative  abilities, and his knowledge of the native, which was afterwards  published in Blue Book (Africa) 7943-96.    It so happened that Mr. Niceman immediately afterwards went home to  England on furlough, so that he did not hear the laments and woeful  wailings of the Ochori folk when they did not get their women or their  goats.    Sanders, working round the Isisi River, with ten Houssas and an attack  of malaria, got a helio message:        \"Go Akasava and settle that infernal woman      palaver.--Administration.\"    So Sanders girded up his loins, took 25 grains of quinine, and leaving  his good work--he was searching for M'Beli, the witch-doctor, who had  poisoned a friend--trekked across country for the Akasava.    In the course of time he came to the city and was met by the chief.    \"What about these women?\" he asked.    \"We will have a palaver,\" said the chief. \"I will summon my headmen and  my councillors.\"    \"Summon nothing,\" said Sanders shortly. \"Send back the women and the  goats you stole from the Ochori.\"    \"Master,\" said the chief, \"at full moon, which is our custom, when the  tide is so, and all signs of gods and devils are propitious, I will do  as you bid.\"    \"Chief,\" said Sanders, tapping the ebony chest of the other with the thin  end of his walking-stick, \"moon and river, gods or devils, those women  and the goats go back to the Ochori folk by sunset, or I tie you to a  tree and flog you till you bleed.\"    \"Master,\" said the chief, \"the women shall be returned.\"    \"And the goats,\" said Sanders.    \"As to the goats,\" said the chief airily, \"they are dead, having been  killed for a feast.\"    \"You will bring them back to life,\" said Sanders.    \"Master, do you think I am a magician?\" asked the chief of the Akasava.    \"I think you are a liar,\" said Sanders impartially, and there the  palaver finished.    That night goats and women returned to the Ochori, and Sanders prepared  to depart.    He took aside the chief, not desiring to put shame upon him or to weaken  his authority.    \"Chief,\" he said, \"it is a long journey to Akasava, and I am a man  fulfilling many tasks. I desire that you do not cause me any further  journey to this territory.\"    \"Master,\" said the chief truthfully, \"I never wish to see you again.\"    Sanders smiled aside, collected his ten Houssas, and went back to the  Isisi River to continue his search for M'Beli.    It was not a nice search for many causes, and there was every reason to  believe, too, that the king of Isisi himself was the murderer's  protector. Confirmation of this view came one morning when Sanders,  encamped by the Big River, was taking a breakfast of tinned milk and  toast. There arrived hurriedly Sato-Koto, the brother of the king, in  great distress of mind, for he was a fugitive from the king's wrath. He  babbled forth all manner of news, in much of which Sanders took no  interest whatever. But what he said of the witch-doctor who lived in the  king's shadow was very interesting indeed, and Sanders sent a messenger  to headquarters, and, as it transpired, headquarters despatched in the  course of time Mr. Niceman--who by this time had returned from  furlough--to morally \"suade\" the king of the Isisi.    From such evidence as we have been able to collect it is evident that  the king was not in a melting mood. It is an indisputable fact that poor  Niceman's head, stuck on a pole before the king's hut, proclaimed the  king's high"]]]
