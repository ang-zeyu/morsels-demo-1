Some Little Things to See     114          PART I    THROUGH A MICROSCOPE    BY SAMUEL WELLS          THROUGH A MICROSCOPE      I    An object one hundredth of an inch in diameter, or of which it would  take one hundred placed side by side to make an inch, is about the  smallest thing that can be easily seen by the unassisted eye. Take a  piece of card and punch a little hole through it with the point of a  small needle, hold it towards a lamp or a window, and you will see the  light through it.      [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    This hole will be about the size just mentioned, and you will find that  you can see it best and most distinctly when you hold it at a certain  distance from your eye; and this distance will not be far from ten  inches, unless you are near-sighted. Now bring it towards your eye and  you will find it becomes blurred and indistinct. You will see by this  experiment that you cannot see things distinctly when held too close to  your eye, or in other words, that you cannot bring your eye nearer to an  object than eight or ten inches and see it well at the same time.    You could see things much smaller than one hundredth of an inch if you  could get your eye close enough to them. How can that be done? By a  microscope? yes, but what is that? This name comes from two Greek words  that mean \"to see small things;\" and a microscope is an instrument by  which your eye can get very close to what you want to see.    To understand this, take out one of your eyes and look at it with the  other one. You see that it is a little round camera; most boys have seen  a camera and some boys can make one. The simplest way to do that is to  take a box, say a cigar box (empty, of course); pull off the cover and  fasten in the place of it a piece of ground glass if you have one: if  not a piece of white letter paper, oiled, will do; bore a hole in the  middle of the bottom with a small gimlet and your camera is done. Point  the bottom with the hole in it out of the window, and throw a piece of  cloth over your head and over the box, as the photographers do, to shut  out the side light, but mind and not cover up the hole; look at the  ground glass (or oiled paper) and you will see things upside down. (Fig.  1.) But what has it to do with my eye? you say. Why, your eye is just  like it, only round, as in fig. 2. And if you hold a doll or anything  else about ten inches in front of the eye you have taken out and look at  the inside of it (the eye, not the doll) just as you look at the ground  glass of your box camera, you will see the doll upside down on the back  of the eye.    But how, do you say, can I see things right side up when they are upside  down in my eye? This is a very good conundrum and it will keep a long  time, till you are about seventy years old and have spare time to sit  down and think about it.    Now you see how your eye is a camera; the pupil is the hole and the  back of the eye, called the retina, is the ground glass.    But you will find that the camera you have just made does not show  things distinctly and beautifully as the photographer's camera does; how  can they be distinct in the eye then?    Because in the photographer's camera, in the hole is a lens, which is a  piece of glass, shaped like a sun glass; and so in your eye just behind  the pupil is a lens, not made of glass, but still almost as transparent  as if it were. In order to see what effect this lens has, take your box  camera, make the hole larger and put a lens in it; one of your magic  lantern lenses will do; and if the lens has the right focus you will see  the images sharp and distinct on your ground glass. The focus probably  will not be just right, so make a paper tube, into which fasten your  lens and slide the tube in and out of the hole until you find the right  focus.    When you have got that right so that you see a boy on the sidewalk  upside down and see his teeth when he laughs, put some small object, the  little doll will do, about three feet in front of your lens, and you  will find the image of it is blurred and indistinct, and that you must  pull your tube out to get the focus on the doll; or if you had another  lens of just the right shape to hold in front of your camera, you would  with that get the focus on the doll.      [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    Thus you can see how it is with your eye, and why you cannot see things  distinctly held close to it. The lens in the eye can change its shape a  little, so that it will focus objects a mile off, or ten inches off, but  it cannot be pushed in and out like the tube in your camera. You can do  this, however, if you take another lens and hold it outside your eye and  let the light go through that first before it comes to the lens in your  eye, and in this way you can get a focus in your retina, and the outside  lens thus forms a part of that optical instrument called your eye. Does  your grandma know that her spectacles are a part of the cameras that she  calls her eyes?    How is it that a lens bends (refracts is the big word for it) the rays  of light? You will learn by and by. You can see that it does so by a few  experiments with your sun glass or any such lens. Hold it between the  sun and a piece of white paper until the white spot in the centre is as  small as you can make it. You will see that the rest of the lens casts a  shadow although it is all glass; this is because the rays of sunlight  that fall on the lens are all bent towards the centre, and so you have a  small white spot on which is concentrated the light and the heat, and  before you have found out how it is all done, your paper takes fire and  the experiment ends in smoke.    Take another piece of paper, and when the white spot is at its smallest,  measure the distance between the lens and the paper, and you will have  the focal distance of the lens.    You have now found out how to get your eye close to an object and see  something that is very small; this is usually called magnifying it,  because it seems to make it look large. Suppose you have a lens that  will let you see a flea through it held just one inch from it, this lens  is now an addition to your eye, as we measure from the lens. If you had  another flea held ten inches off, so big that it would just be hidden by  the little flea, the one farthest off would be ten times as large as the  near one. (Fig. 3.) In this case it is said that the lens having a focal  length of one inch magnifies ten times, or has a power of ten.      [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    The shortest usual distance of objects seen distinctly being taken as  ten inches, microscopists have agreed to consider that as the standard  of measurement, and objects seen through a lens are considered magnified  to the size they would have if projected ten inches off, like our little  flea.      II.--THE OUTFIT.    Now that we have got hold of the idea that the eye is an optical  instrument, and that to increase its capacity for seeing small things we  add to it other optical contrivances, making with it one instrument  composed of several parts, let us look at such additions more  particularly.      [Illustration: FIG. 1.]      [Illustration: FIG. 2.]      [Illustration: FIG. 3.--OPEN AND CLOSED.]    One pleasant September afternoon, three gentlemen were strolling along  the banks of the Wissahickon, in Philadelphia's beautiful park, and  stopping now and then to examine some little flower or insect with  pocket lenses, when they discovered that some little boys out for a  holiday were watching their proceedings with a curious and mystified  interest. One of the gentlemen had a pocket microscope with three lenses  of different sizes, as in Fig. 1. Calling the boys up to him he showed  them a little flower magnified. They had never dreamed of such a sight,  and their wonder and amazement were as great as if they suddenly beheld  a new world. You will be as surprised as they were when you take your  first peep, but you must learn to see such things _by yourselves_. The  first thing you need is a simple microscope, that is, one with a single  lens, small enough to be carried in the pocket. There are different  forms and sizes of such microscopes, varying in quality and price. Those  like the one just mentioned are made with from one to four lenses each,  and are perhaps the most generally useful. Then there is the Coddington  lens (Fig. 2) which is still more compact; and it is sometimes made in  the form of Fig. 3. It has a very short focus, and is not, therefore,  very easy to use. Achromatic doublets and triplets are made of two or  more lenses cemented together and mounted in the same style as the  Coddington lens; they are very much better than the Coddington, but are  more expensive.

Before World War II the isthmus could be reached  readily only by railroad or by ocean vessel to Salina Cruz or  Coatzacoalcos. With the advent of roads, principally the Trans-isthmian  Highway, vast areas of the interior of the isthmus became accessible to  biologists. Nevertheless, long before roads were built in the isthmian  region collectors and biologists visited it, especially the town of  Tehuantepec, from which collections date back to the 1870's. Therefore,  it is rather surprising that no attempt has been made to present a  faunal list of the amphibians or reptiles of the isthmus. Ruthven  (1912) summarized his collections from the vicinity of Cuatotolapam,  Veracruz, and Hartweg and Oliver (1940) presented an annotated list of  the species collected by them in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. In recent  years there have been only a few papers reporting species from the  isthmus (Fugler and Webb, 1957; Langebartel and Smith, 1959). The  zoogeographic significance of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is exemplified  by the works of Burt (1931), Duellman (1958), Gloyd (1940), Oliver  (1948), and Stuart (1941), who in their discussions of evolution and  dispersal of various genera of reptiles, pointed out that the Isthmus  of Tehuantepec was a region of zoogeographic importance.    Originally I intended to study the entire herpetofauna of the isthmus.  But I have not had opportunity to study all of the reptiles, and I have  not had the inclination to solve certain taxonomic problems concerning  them. The amphibians that I collected, together with all other known  specimens in museums, have been studied. Therefore, the present report  is concerned only with the amphibians. Only the amphibians of the  lowlands of the isthmus have been sampled adequately. Although I have  commented on the highland species in the discussion of distribution,  they are not included in the systematic section, which deals solely  with the 36 species definitely known to occur in the lowlands of the  isthmus.    Among the species of amphibians that I would expect to occur in the  isthmus, the only one not yet found there is _Hyla phaeota_. Sufficient  specimens of most of the species are available to show their variation  in the isthmus. Consequently, the systematics of these amphibians is on  a fairly substantial basis. Probably certain species in the isthmian  region will be found to be conspecific with others to the south, for  example _Hyla ebraccata_ with _Hyla leucophyllata_ and _Hyla  robertmertensi_ with _Hyla underwoodi_. Nevertheless, such taxonomic  changes will not affect the distributional picture presented here. Our  greatest lack of knowledge concerning the amphibians is about their  life histories, as may be illustrated by the following questions, all  of which now are without definite answers. Where do many of the small  frogs conceal themselves during the dry season? What amount of, if any,  interspecific competition exists among several species of tree frogs,  all of which breed in the same ponds? What factors in the environment  permit certain amphibians, but not others, to live in the humid  rainforests, as well as in the arid tropical scrub forest? The answers  to these questions and many others must await additional field studies.    The purpose of this paper is to make known the species of amphibians  living in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, to describe the environments in  which they live, and to discuss their distribution in the isthmus. With  respect to the distribution of animals in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec I  will attempt to explain the present patterns of distribution with  special reference to climatic fluctuation in the Pleistocene.      _Acknowledgments_    My extensive field work in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec was made possible  by grants from the Penrose Fund of the American Philosophical Society  (1956) and the Bache Fund of the National Academy of Sciences (1958).  Furthermore, my field work received the hearty support of the Museum of  Zoology at the University of Michigan; for their cooperation I am  indebted to Norman Hartweg, T. H. Hubbell, and Henry van der Schalie.  In the course of my studies I received helpful suggestions from Norman  Hartweg, L. C. Stuart, and Charles F. Walker, to whom I am grateful.  For permission to examine specimens in their care I thank Doris M.  Cochran, Hobart M. Smith, and Richard G. Zweifel. I am deeply indebted  to Thomas MacDougall for many suggestions and for aid in preparing the  gazetteer. I am most grateful for the efforts of my field companions,  Richard E. Etheridge, Jerome B. Tulecke, John Wellman, and especially  my wife, Ann S. Duellman, who spent many long days and nights gathering  much of the data on which this report is based. Our work in the isthmus  was furthered by the generous help and hospitality of many residents,  especially the late Wilbur Barker of Tehuantepec, Fortunado Delgado of  Rancho Las Hojitas near Acayucan, Cesar Farjas of Donaji, and Juan  Mayol of San Andres Tuxtla. Profesor Jordi Julia Z. of the Laboratorio  de Entomologia, Comision del Papaloapan, Ciudad Aleman, Veracruz,  helped make possible my field work in 1959; for this he has my sincere  thanks. In conclusion I express my gratitude to Ing. Juan Lozano  Franco, Secretaria de Agricultura y Ganaderia, for providing me with  the necessary permits.      _Field Studies in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec_    I first visited the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and collected on the Pacific  lowlands of the isthmus in July, 1955. At that time heavy rains and  impassable roads restricted travelling. In February and March of 1956  my wife and I concentrated our efforts in the central region between  the Rio Jaltepec and Matias Romero, but also made several trips across  the isthmus to gather ecological data in the dry season. In July of the  same year, accompanied by Richard E. Etheridge, we again crossed the  isthmus several times in order to gather ecological data in the wet  season, and studied especially hylid frogs, most of which had not been  seen in the dry season. Accompanied by Jerome B. Tulecke and John  Wellman, I collected again in the isthmus in July, 1958, between Salina  Cruz and Tehuantepec, and between Coatzacoalcos and Cosoleacaque. In  March and April, 1959, I collected at Ciudad Aleman. Nearly 1200  specimens of 30 species of amphibians were thus collected in the  Isthmus of Tehuantepec; all specimens are now in the Museum of Zoology  at the University of Michigan. Of other species known from the isthmus,  I have had field experience with all but one (_Bolitoglossa  veracrucis_) in other parts of Mexico.      _Sources of Material_    There are in museum collections nearly 3000 specimens of amphibians  with reliable data from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Among the first  herpetological specimens collected in the isthmian region are those  assembled by Francis Sumichrast in the 1870's from the vicinity of  Santa Efigenia and Tapanatepec, Oaxaca. These specimens were sent to  the United States National Museum and the Museum"]]]
