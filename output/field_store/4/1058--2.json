FOOD IN WAR TIME    I    A BALANCED DIET      There is no doubt that under the conditions existing before the war the  American people lived in a higher degree of comfort than that enjoyed in  Europe. Hard times in America have always been better times than the  best times in Europe. As a student in Munich in 1890 I remember paying  three dollars a month for my room, five cents daily for my breakfast,  consisting of coffee and a roll without butter, and thirty-five cents  for a four-course dinner at a fashionable restaurant. This does not  sound extravagant, but it represents luxury when compared with the diet  of the poorest Italian peasants of southern Italy. Two Italian  scientists describe how this class of people live mainly on cornmeal,  olive oil, and green stuffs and have done so for generations. There is  no milk, cheese, or eggs in their dietary. Meat in the form of fat pork  is taken three or four times a year. Cornmeal is taken as \"polenta,\" or  is mixed with beans and oil, or is made into corn bread. Cabbage or the  leaves of beets are boiled in water and then eaten with oil flavored  with garlic or Spanish pepper. One of the families investigated  consisted of eight individuals, of whom two were children. The annual  income was 424 francs, or $84. Of this, three cents per day per adult  was spent for food and the remaining three-fifths of a cent was spent  for other purposes. Little wonder that such people have migrated to  America, but it may strike some as astonishing that a race so nourished  should have become the man power in the construction of our railways,  our subways, and our great buildings.    Dr. McCollum will tell you that the secret of it all lies in the green  leaves. The quality of the protein in corn is poor, but the protein in  the leaves supplements that of corn, so that a good result is obtained.  Olive oil when taken alone is a poor fat in a nutritive sense, but when  taken with green leaves, these furnish that one of the peculiar  accessory substances, commonly known as vitamines, which is present most  abundantly in butter-fat, and gives to butter-fat and to the fat in  whole milk its dominant nutritive value. The green leaves likewise  furnish another accessory substance, also present in milk, a substance  which is soluble in water and which is necessary for normal life.  Furthermore, the green leaves contain mineral matter in considerable  quantity and in about the same proportions as they exist in milk.    Here then is the message of economy in diet, corn the cheapest of all  the cereals, a vegetable oil cheaper by far than animal fat, which two  materials taken together would bring disaster upon the human race, but  if taken with the addition of cabbage or beet-tops they become capable  of maintaining mankind from generation to generation. One can safely  refer to such a diet as a balanced diet. Just as in the case of the  modern experimental biological analysis of a balanced ration in which  such a ration is given to rats and its efficiency as a diet is tested by  its capacity to support normal growth and reproduction of the species,  so here the experimental evidence is presented that corn and olive oil  may become a sustaining diet when green leaves are a supplementary  factor.    This preliminary sketch shows several important fundamentals of food and  nutrition. If one gives an animal a mixture of purified food-stuffs,  pure protein, pure starch, purified fat, and a mixture of salts like the  salts of milk, the animal will surely die. But if one substitutes  butter-fat for purified fat, and adds a water solution of the natural  salts of milk, the animal lives and thrives.    Again, the illustration shows how corn may be so supplemented with  other food-stuffs as to become extremely valuable in nutrition. It is  especially valuable at the present time because corn is comparatively  cheap and plentiful. But one asks how about pellagra? It must be here  definitely stated that the use of cornmeal is not the cause of pellagra,  provided the right kind of other foods be taken with it. Pellagra occurs  in the \"corn belt\" of the United States, and especially among the poorer  classes in the south. The disease has developed since the introduction  in 1880 of highly perfected milling machinery which furnishes corn and  wheat completely freed from their outer coverings. In Italy, where the  milling of corn is still primitive, pellagra is not so severe as with  us, because the corn offal is not completely removed and this contains  the accessory food substances or vitamines which are essential to life.  Pellagra is generally believed to be produced by a too exclusive use of  highly milled corn and wheat flour in association with salt meats and  canned goods, all of which are deficient in vitamines. The administration  of fresh milk is naturally indicated. Goldberger states that after the  addition of milk to the diet of a pellagrin, the typical clinical  picture of pellagra no longer persists. The poor in the mill towns of  the South lived too exclusively upon a corn diet without admixture of  milk or fresh animal food or even of cabbage, and pellagra has been the  consequence.    The Food Administrator asks us to eat corn bread and save the wheat for  export. It is a very small sacrifice to eat corn bread at one meal or  more a day. Indian corn saved our New England ancestors from starvation,  and we can in part substitute it for our wheat and send the latter  abroad to spare others from starvation. The simplest elements of  patriotism demand that we do this. Therefore let us cry, \"Eat corn bread  and save the wheat for France, the home of Lafayette!\"    The United States Department of Agriculture has estimated that only 6.6  per cent. of our corn crop is used for human food, and of this, 3.4 per  cent. is consumed by the farmers and their families.    The substitution of foods is no new thing. We find that an English  contemporary author thus described the food habits of the English people  during the \"golden days of Good Queen Bess,\" three hundred and fifty  years ago:       \"The gentilitie commonly provide themselves sufficiently of     wheat for their own tables, whylest their household and poore     neighbours in some shires are forced to content themselves     with rye or barleie; yea and in time of dearth many with bread     made eyther of beanes, peason[1] or otes, or of altogether and     some acornes among.\"    [1] An obsolete plural of pease.    A difference between those days and ours is that the \"gentilitie\" and  the \"poore neighbours\" are now asked to unite in reducing the  consumption of wheat and to do this for the safety and welfare of all  mankind.    Another point in war economy is the use of whole milk in greater  quantity, and the diminution of the use of butter and cream. Cream is  bought only by the wealthy, but in sufficient volume to largely reduce  the amount of whole milk available. In Germany before the war 15 per  cent. of the milk supply of that country was used for the production of  cream. The consequent restriction of the milk supply was distinctly to  the detriment of the health of the peasant farmers of Bavaria. Regarding  the use of butter, a Swiss professor, himself an expert in nutrition,  complains that whereas in his youth children were never given butter on  their bread for breakfast, not even when there was no jam in the house,  yet to-day absence of butter from the table is held to be indicative of  direst poverty.    If one takes a pint of whole milk daily, or even, as we have seen,  cabbage or beet-tops in its stead, one may take fat in the forms of  olive oil or cottonseed oil, corn oil, cocoanut oil, peanut butter, or  in other vegetable oils, without possible prejudice to health.    Osborne and Mendel, and more recently Halliburton, have pointed out that  oleomargarine as prepared from beef-fat contains the fat-soluble  growth-promoting accessory substance or vitamine which is present in  butter-fat, but which is not contained in vegetable oils or in lard.

Representatives of  the group occur from lowland Mexico to Argentina; the greatest  diversity is reached in the lowlands of southeastern Brazil (Cochran,  1955). The group apparently originated in South America; the endemic  Central American species evolved from stocks that invaded Middle  America after the closure of the Colombian Portal in the late Pliocene.    Dunn (1933) partially defined the _rubra_ group as it occurs in Central  America. Cope (1865, 1876, 1887), Brocchi (1881), Boulenger (1882),  Guenther (1901), Noble (1918), Kellogg (1932), Dunn and Emlen (1932),  Stuart (1935), and Gaige (1936) dealt with the Middle American species  now considered to make up the _rubra_ group. More recently, Taylor  (1952, 1958), Fouquette (1958), Starrett (1960), and Duellman (1960,  1963, 1966a) studied aspects of the taxonomy and biology of the species  of this group. The five species of the _rubra_ group in Central America  have received ten different names. One species, _Hyla staufferi_, has  received five names (two subspecies are recognized herein). _Hyla  boulengeri_ was named in the genus _Scytopis_, but the type species of  _Scytopis_ is a member of the genus _Phrynohyas_ Fitzinger, 1843  (Duellman, 1956.)    Little has been published concerning the ecology, life history,  osteology, and mating calls of the Middle American species of this  group. The purpose of the present report is to describe the species  occurring in Middle America and to comment on their distributions,  ecology, cranial osteology, and mating calls, and in so doing provide  evidence for the evolutionary history of the species inhabiting Middle  America.

For the loan of tape-recordings of mating calls I  thank Drs. W. Frank Blair, University of Texas, and Richard G. Zweifel,  American Museum of Natural History.    I am indebted to the Ford Foundation-Universidad de Oriente (Venezuela)  Science Project for a scholarship which enabled me to study for two  years at The University of Kansas, foster institution of the project. I  have benefited by being able to work in the Museum of Natural History  at The University of Kansas and I am grateful to Dr. E. Raymond Hall,  Director, for providing space and equipment.    I gratefully acknowledge the assistance and advice of Dr. William E.  Duellman, who suggested and directed this work, made available  specimens under his care and gave much of his time in reading the  manuscript and suggesting improvements. I am grateful to Dr. Frank B.  Cross who critically read the manuscript and made many editorial  suggestions. I am indebted to Linda Trueb for assistance with the  osteological aspects of this study; she helped to clarify many  confusing points. I am grateful to Charles W. Myers for making  available his field notes on these frogs in Panama, to Arthur C.  Echternacht for reading part of the manuscript, and to John D. Lynch  for many suggestions and helpful criticisms. The illustrations were  executed by David M. Dennis.      Materials and Methods    For the purposes of the present study I examined 1383 preserved  specimens, 50 skeletons, and 9 lots of tadpoles. External  characteristics used in the analysis of variation are those currently  employed in the study of anuran systematics. Twelve measurements  and six proportions were taken in the manner described by Duellman  (1956). Only the most important references are given in the synonymies,  except those of the two subspecies of _Hyla staufferi,_ which are  more nearly complete. The taxonomic history of each frog is discussed  under _Remarks_ in each account. The cranial osteology was studied  by using skeletons and cleared and stained specimens of all species.  Developmental stages of tadpoles were determined from Gosner's (1960)  table. Personal field work in Central America in the summer of 1966  provided an opportunity to make observations on the ecology, calling  sites, and color in life; these data were supplemented by field notes  from, and discussions with, Dr. William E. Duellman and Charles W.  Myers.    The mating calls of the frogs were recorded in the field on Magnemite  and Uher Tape Recorders by Dr. Duellman in the course of his work on  the hylid frogs of Middle America--supported by grants from the  National Science Foundation (G-9827 and GB-1441). These recordings,  plus those borrowed from other institutions, provided 50 tapes for  analysis of the mating calls. The calls were analyzed on a Vibralyzer  (Kay Electric Company).          THE HYLA RUBRA GROUP      _Definition._--The species forming the group are small to moderate-sized  tree frogs (maximum snout-vent length of males of various species 20-49  mm.), distinguished from other groups in the genus _Hyla_ as follows:  Brown, grayish brown, or yellowish tan above; thighs plain, marbled  with dark brown, or having vertical bands; vocal sac single, median,  subgular; snout flat, protruding, rounded or pointed; webbing between  fingers reduced or absent; web between first and second toes reduced to  fringe on second toe, rest of toes about half webbed; tarsal fold  reduced or absent; shanks robust; inner metatarsal tubercle larger than  outer; prevomerine teeth on transverse ridges between small to large  sized choanae; skull generally longer than wide; nasals large (length  more than 40 per cent total length of skull) and having pointed  maxillary processes; maxillary bearing small ventromedial palatine  process; quadratojugal slender, always joined to maxillary by bony  suture; auditory region of prooetic slender and short; delicate  spatulate columella ventral to crista parotica, broad basally,  compressed anterolaterally, slightly rounded distally; anterior arm of  squamosal extending about half distance to maxillary; sphenethmoid  wider than long; frontoparietal fontanelle present or absent;  prevomerine, premaxillary, and maxillary teeth present; prevomer with  two lateral processes forming incomplete bony margin to internal nares;  tadpoles having pointed xiphicercal tail, snout short, rounded; 2/3  tooth rows; dorsal fin deeper than ventral fin; sinistral spiracle;  short dextral anal tube not reaching edge of ventral fin; mating calls  consisting of single long note or series of short notes.    _Composition._--This group contains about 24 currently recognized  species, most of which occur in Brazil. Only five species--_boulengeri,_  _elaeochroa_, _foliamorta_, _rubra_, and _staufferi_ with two  subspecies--occur in Central America. _Hyla boulengeri_ and _rubra_ are  widespread in South America, and _foliamorta_ occurs in Colombia,  whereas the other species are known only from Middle America.    _Distribution._--The species of the _Hyla rubra_ group range from the  lowlands of northern Argentina and Bolivia to southern Tamaulipas and  Guerrero, Mexico.    _Comments._--In Central America two subgroups of species can be  recognized. _Hyla boulengeri_ and _H. foliamorta_ are distinctive in  the large size of adults (snout-vent lengths 41-49 mm.); both have  prominent bars on the thighs, a well-defined interorbital triangular  mark, blotches or spots dorsally, and large choanae. _Hyla elaeochroa,_  _H. rubra,_ and _H. staufferi_ are smaller (snout-vent lengths 29-40  mm.); they have the thighs weakly barred or vermiculate anteriorly and  posteriorly or unmarked, an ill-defined interorbital "]]]
