It is in the possession of Mr. Leadbeater, of Brewer  Street, by whom it was received from New Zealand; and who gave me the  opportunity of now publishing the accompanying figure and description.    The two extreme points of difference in the Linnaean kingfishers, are seen  in the _Alcedo Ispida_, and _A. gigantea_; the last of which has been made  into the genus _Dacelo_. It will, nevertheless, be found, that from among  the birds left in the old genus, there are a great number, (of which,  indeed, this bird is a striking example,) which are much nearer allied to  _Dacelo_ than to _Alcedo_, where they now stand. It will appear, therefore,  more natural to consider _Halcyon_ and _Dacelo_ as one genus--which may be  called by either name, but which must be distinguished by the characters  herein given to _Halcyon_, inasmuch as the generic definition of _Dacelo_  (founded on one bird) will be found too restricted to comprehend all.    Total length ten inches; bill two and a half from the gape, and one and a  half from the nostrils; the tip of the upper mandible with a slight  inclination downwards, and with an appearance of a notch; the whole head,  neck, and under plumage, of a delicate fawn colour; under wing covers the  same; the remaining upper plumage, with the wings and tail, changeable blue  green; ears sea green and dusky, united to a narrow black nuchal collar;  wings four inches long, and the tail, which is even, three and a quarter;  the hind head is slightly crested, and the feet pale brown.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 68    [Illustration]    POGONIAS rubrifrons,    _Red-fronted Toothbill._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum mediocre, crassum, validum, basi latiore quam altiore,      vibrissis longis incumbentibus tecta, lateribus ultra basin compressis,      culmine arcuato, subcarinato; mandibulae superioris margine dentibus 1      vel 2 armato, mandibulae inferioris marginem obtegente.

The  first of these (which are still retained under the old genus,) are natives  of Asia; the next in affinity were first characterized by Illiger under the  name of _Pogonias_, and are distributed on the African continent; while the  prototype genus in America is _Tamatia_ (Cuvier), in which continent not  any of the two preceding have been found: thus each quarter of the globe  lying within the tropics have their corresponding groups of a family,  possessing a general, but at the same time an individuality of character.    I am obliged to Mr. Leadbeater for the opportunity of figuring this new and  rare species, which he believes to have come from Sierra Leone. Its total  length was six inches; the under-covers of the wings white; the tail two  inches long, the feathers broad and even.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 69    [Illustration]    THECLA Galathea,    _Red-bordered Hair-streak._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Antennae clavo elongato, compresso, obtuso terminatae.

They are an obvious and very natural family, though the  species are as yet but little understood, and not one half of them  described. I have observed a singular peculiarity in a great many of these  insects, which is, that when they are at rest in the sun, the lower wings  are constantly in a quick vibrating motion up and down, as if the insect  was rubbing them together, more particularly where the two lobes (or obtuse  tails) of the under wings meet, though what purpose this is intended to  accomplish remains unknown.    The upper surface of the wings in the greatest number of the _Hair streaks_  (as they are aptly called by English collectors) are of various shades of  vivid blue, so that the species can only be ascertained from the under  markings, which are usually very striking and delicate: they are all of a  small size.    This is an African species, and both sexes are in the cabinet of my friend  Mr. Haworth.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 70    [Illustration]    CONUS terebra,    _Screw Cone._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 65.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _C. cylindraceo-elongatus, albidus, striis transversis elevatis,      fasciisque binis flavescentibus, spira crassa obtusa._ Lam.

BY OUR TAMMANY SACHEM.        There's a wonderful land far out in the West,      Well worthy a visit, my friend;    There, Puritans thought, as the sun went to rest,      Creation itself had an end.    'T is a wild, weird spot on the continent's face,      A wound which is ghastly and red,    Where the savages write the deeds of their race      In blood that they constantly shed.    The graves of the dead the fair prairies deface,      And stamp it the kingdom of dread.      The emigrant trail is a skeleton path;      You measure its miles by the bones;    There savages struck, in their merciless wrath,      And now, after sunset, the moans,    When tempests are out, fill the shuddering air,      And ghosts flit the wagons beside,    And point to the skulls lying grinning and bare      And beg of the teamsters a ride;    Sometimes 't is a father with snow on his hair,      Again, 't is a youth and his bride.      What visions of horror each valley could tell,      If Providence gave it a tongue!    How often its Eden was changed to a hell,      In which a whole train had been flung;    How death cry and battle-shout frightened the birds,      And prayers were as thick as the leaves,    And no one to catch the poor dying one's words      But Death, as he gathered his sheaves:    You see the bones bleaching among the wild herds,      In shrouds that the field spider weaves.      That era is passing--another one comes,      The era of steam and the plow,    With clangor of commerce and factory hums,      Where only the wigwam is now.    Like mist of the morning before the bright sun,      The cloud from the land disappears;    The Spirit of Murder his circle has run      And fled from the march of the years;    The click of machine drowns the click of the gun,      And day hides the night time of tears.          PREFACE.      The purpose of this work is to make the reader better acquainted with  that wild land which he has known from childhood, as the home of the  Indian and the buffalo. The Rocky Mountain chain, distorted and rugged,  has been aptly called the colossal vertebrae of our continent's broad  back, and from thence, as a line, the plains, weird and wonderful,  stretch eastward through Colorado, and embrace the entire western half  of Kansas.    Fortune, not long since, threw in my way an invitation, which I gladly  accepted, to join a semi-scientific party, since somewhat known to fame  through various articles in the newspaper press, in a sojourn of several  months on the great plains. At a meeting held with due solemnity on the  eve of starting, the Professor (to whom the reader will be introduced in  the proper connection) was chosen leader of the expedition, while to my  lot fell the office of editor of the future record, or rather Grand  Scribe of what we were pleased to call our \"Log Book.\" The latter now  lies before me, in all its glory of shabby covers and dirty pages. Its  soiled face is as honorable as that of the laborer who comes from his  task in a well harvested field. Out of the sheaves gathered during our  journey, I shall try and take such portions as may best supply the  mental cravings of the countless thousands who hunger for the life and  the lore of the far West.    I have given the mistakes as well as triumphs of our expedition, and the  members of the party will readily recognize their familiar camp names.  The disguise will probably be pleasant, as few like to see their  failures on public parade, preferring rather to leave these in barracks,  and let their successes only appear at review.    The plains have a face, a people, and a brute creation, peculiarly their  own, and to these our party devoted earnest study. The expedition  presented a rare opportunity of becoming acquainted with the game of the  country; and, in writing the present volume, my aim has been to make it  so far a text-book for amateur hunters that they may become at once  conversant with the habits of the game, and the best manner of killing  it. The time is not far distant, when the plains and the Rocky  Mountains will be sought by thousands annually, as a favorite field for  sport and recreation.    Another and still larger class, it is hoped, will find much of interest  and value in the following pages. From every state in the Union, people  are constantly passing westward. We found emigrant wagons on spots from  which the Indians had just removed their wigwams. Multitudes more are  now on the way, with the earnest purpose of founding homes and, if  possible, of finding fortunes. In order to aid this class, as well as  the sportsman, I have gathered in an appendix such additional  information as may be useful to both.    The scientific details of our trip will probably be published in proper  form and time, by the savans interested. In regard to these, my object  has been simply to chronicle such matters as made an impression upon my  own mind, being content with what cream might be gathered by an  amateur's skimming, while the more bulky milk should be saved in  capacious scientific buckets.    Professor Cope, the well known naturalist, of the Academy of Sciences,  Philadelphia, received for examination and classification the most  valuable fossils we obtained, and to him I am indebted for a large  amount of most interesting and valuable scientific matter, which will  be found embodied in chapters twenty-third and twenty-fourth.    The illustrations of men and brutes in this work are studies from life.  Whenever it was possible, we had photographs taken.    The plains, it must be said, are a tract with which Romance has had much  more to do than History. Red men, brave and chivalrous, and unnatural  buffalo, with the habits of lions, exist only in imagination. In these  pages, my earnest endeavor, when dealing with actualities, has been to  \"hold the mirror up to Nature,\" and to describe men, manners, and things  as they are in real life upon the frontiers, and beyond, to-day.
