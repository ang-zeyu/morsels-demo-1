As if hunting for profit, night hunting for either pleasure or gain  and professional hunting generally had no importance, writers of  books have contented themselves with dwelling on the study and  presentation of matters relating solely to the men who hunt for sport  only. Even then the Fox Chase and Bird Hunting has been the burden of  the greater percent of such books.    It remained for the A. R. Harding Publishing Co. (publishers of the  Hunter-Trader-Trapper magazine and a number of helpful and practical  books on hunting topics), to appreciate the demand for books and  reading matter adapted especially to the tens of thousands of hunters  who make, or partially make, their livelihood from hunting and  trapping, as well as a million casual hunters and farmers of the  United States and Canada.    The keynote of success was struck in this direction by obtaining  articles and letters from these very men themselves, written and  printed in their own language, depending for favor on their  explicitness and practical value, borne of actual experience, rather  than flowing language, high sounding conventionalities and impressive  technicalities so dear to the hearts of the Bench Show enthusiasts.    The title of this book quotes its object. To tell something of night  hunting, and especially to suggest how the ever necessary dog can  best be selected, trained, maintained and utilized, is the  consideration of first importance. To round out the subject all forms  of hunting will receive some notice, and the various breeds of dogs  will be so far dealt with, that their value and usefulness in their  given fields may be determined. Best of all, the contents of this  volume are based on the opinions and declarations of men who have had  years of experience in the matters on which they presume to write.  The Compiler does not assume authorship, the matter herein being very  largely from articles which have appeared in Hunter-Trader-Trapper  and elsewhere. Credit is hereby extended and our thanks offered to  all writers whose efforts contribute to the sum total of this volume.    If this book contributes to the success in handling of dogs or opens  new avenues of recreation, sport and profit for any of its readers,  we shall consider its mission has been fulfilled.      Oliver Hartley.      [Illustration: The Fruits of Night Hunting.]        HUNTING DOGS.        CHAPTER I.    NIGHT HUNTING.    Night hunting is a favorite form of hunting sport the continent over.  Prime factor of the joyous, though strenuous night quest is the  'coon, the court jester and wit of the nocturnal tribe of small fur  bearers.    Owing to the scarcity of other game and general distribution of  raccoon the country over, 'coon hunting is gaining in popular favor,  winning over many of the wealthy, city-dwelling red-bloods who  formerly were content with more or less pleasant and successful  sallies to the fields in the day-time.    Consequently there is an increased demand for properly bred and  trained dogs to afford the maximum of success and pleasure in this  pursuit. With the ownership of dogs go the care, maintenance and  proper methods of handling these willing helpers. Surprising is the  meagerness of the information available to the average hunter, though  night hunting is an institution as old as the settlement of  Jamestown.    The craft of developing dogs and using them to the best advantage in  this connection, has been by precept and example handed down from  generation to generation. Much has been lost in this way and not so  much accomplished as might have been attained by aid of the printed  and pictured methods of today. Most certainly more attention will  hereafter be paid to night hunting, and more painstaking records made  and kept for the up-growing practical sportsmen, in which direction  the present volume is a long and definite step.      [Illustration: The Court Jester of the Nocturnal Tribe.]    Our task is to offer guidance and advice as to the dogs. Yet to do  this clearly, the reader must know something of the nature and habits  of the animals to be hunted and the effort involved.    A southern gentleman of experience and training has the following to  say about 'coon hunting:    The 'coon is a wily little animal, and his habits are very  interesting to note. He is a veritable trickster, compared with which  the proverbial cunning fox must take a back seat. One of the 'coon's  most common tricks employed to fool the hound is known among hunters  as \"tapping the tree,\" and which he accomplishes in this way: When he  hears the hound's first note baying on trail, he climbs up a large  tree, runs to the furthest extremity of one of the largest branches  and doubling himself up into a ball, leaps as far as possible out  from the tree. This he repeats several times on different trees, then  makes a long run, only to go thru the same performances in another  place. Onward comes the hound, till he reaches the first tree the  'coon went up, and if it is a young and inexperienced hound, he will  give the \"tree bark\" until the hunters reach the tree, fell it, and  find the game not there.      [Illustration: A Pure and A Cross Bred Coon Dog.]    All this time Mr. 'Coon is quietly fishing and laughing in his  sleeve, perhaps a mile away. But not so with the wise old coon hound.  The old, experienced cooner, with seemingly human intelligence, no  sooner reaches the tree Mr. 'Coon has \"tapped\" than he begins  circling around the tree, never opening his mouth--circling wider and  wider until he strikes the trail again. This he repeats every time  the 'coon takes a tree, until finally, when he has to take a tree to  keep from being caught on the ground, the hound circles as before  and, finding no trail leading away, he goes back to the tree, and  with a triumphant cry proclaims the fact that he is victorious. He is  not the least bit doubtful. He knows the coon went up the tree and he  knows he has never come down so he reasons (?) that the coon is  there, and with every breath he calls his master to come and bag his  game. When the tree is felled the fun begins. The 'coon is game to  death. He dies fighting--and such a magnificent fight it is! The  uninformed might suppose there would not be much of a fight between a  50-pound 'coon hound and a 20-pound 'coon. Well, there is not, if the  'coon hound is experienced and knows his business. Of course, the  'coon will put up a masterly fight, and some time is required to put  him out of business; but the old 'coon dog  will finally kill any  'coon. But if the fight is between a young or inexperienced dog and a  full grown 'coon the chances are that you will suffer the  mortification of seeing your dog tuck his tail between his legs and  make for home at a very rapid and unbecoming rate of speed.    To prove this, get a good 'coon hound and let him tree a 'coon; have  along your Bull-dogs, Bull Terriers, Pointers, Setters, Collies, or  any other breed you believe can kill a 'coon; tie your 'coon hound,  cut the tree, and let your fighters on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3426"],[0,"On Books and the Housing of Them (#1)"],[1,"BOOKS AND THE HOUSING OF THEM      By William Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898)      In the old age of his intellect (which at this point seemed to taste  a little of decrepitude), Strauss declared [1] that the doctrine of  immortality has recently lost the assistance of a passable argument,  inasmuch as it has been discovered that the stars are inhabited; for  where, he asks, could room now be found for such a multitude of souls?  Again, in view of the current estimates of prospective population for  this earth, some people have begun to entertain alarm for the probable  condition of England (if not Great Britain) when she gets (say) seventy  millions that are allotted to her against six or eight hundred millions  for the United States. We have heard in some systems of the pressure of  population upon food; but the idea of any pressure from any quarter upon  space is hardly yet familiar. Still, I suppose that many a reader must  have been struck with the naive simplicity of the hyperbole of St. John,  [2] perhaps a solitary unit of its kind in the New Testament: \"the  which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world  itself could not contain the books that should be written.\"    A book, even Audubon (I believe the biggest known), is smaller than a  man; but, in relation to space, I entertain more proximate apprehension  of pressure upon available space from the book population than from  the numbers of mankind. We ought to recollect, with more of a realized  conception than we commonly attain to, that a book consists, like a  man, from whom it draws its lineage, of a body and a soul. They are not  always proportionate to each other. Nay, even the different members  of the book-body do not sing, but clash, when bindings of a profuse  costliness are imposed, as too often happens in the case of Bibles and  books of devotion, upon letter-press which is respectable journeyman's  work and nothing more. The men of the Renascence had a truer sense  of adaptation; the age of jewelled bindings was also the age of  illumination and of the beautiful miniatura, which at an earlier  stage meant side or margin art,[3] and then, on account of the small  portraitures included in it, gradually slid into the modern sense of  miniature. There is a caution which we ought to carry with us more and  more as we get in view of the coming period of open book trade, and of  demand practically boundless. Noble works ought not to be printed  in mean and worthless forms, and cheapness ought to be limited by an  instinctive sense and law of fitness. The binding of a book is the dress  with which it walks out into the world. The paper, type and ink are the  body, in which its soul is domiciled. And these three, soul, body, and  habilament, are a triad which ought to be adjusted to one another by the  laws of harmony and good sense.    Already the increase of books is passing into geometrical progression.  And this is not a little remarkable when we bear in mind that in Great  Britain, of which I speak, while there is a vast supply of cheap works,  what are termed \"new publications\" issue from the press, for the most  part, at prices fabulously high, so that the class of real purchasers  has been extirpated, leaving behind as buyers only a few individuals who  might almost be counted on the fingers, while the effective circulation  depends upon middle-men through the engine of circulating libraries.  These are not so much owners as distributers of books, and they mitigate  the difficulty of dearness by subdividing the cost, and then selling  such copies as are still in decent condition at a large reduction. It  is this state of things, due, in my opinion, principally to the present  form of the law of copyright, which perhaps may have helped to make  way for the satirical (and sometimes untrue) remark that in times of  distress or pressure men make their first economies on their charities,  and their second on their books.    The annual arrivals at the Bodleian Library are, I believe, some twenty  thousand; at the British Museum, forty thousand, sheets of all kinds  included. Supposing three-fourths of these to be volumes, of one size  or another, and to require on the average an inch of shelf space, the  result will be that in every two years nearly a mile of new shelving  will be required to meet the wants of a single library. But, whatever  may be the present rate of growth, it is small in comparison with what  it is likely to become. The key of the question lies in the hands of the  United Kingdom and the United States jointly. In this matter there rests  upon these two Powers no small responsibility. They, with their vast  range of inhabited territory, and their unity of tongue, are masters  of the world, which will have to do as they do. When the Britains and  America are fused into one book market; when it is recognized that  letters, which as to their material and their aim are a high-soaring  profession, as to their mere remuneration are a trade; when artificial  fetters are relaxed, and printers, publishers, and authors obtain the  reward which well-regulated commerce would afford them, then let floors  beware lest they crack, and walls lest they bulge and burst, from the  weight of books they will have to carry and to confine.    It is plain, for one thing, that under the new state of things  specialism, in the future, must more and more abound. But specialism  means subdivision of labor; and with subdivision labor ought to be  more completely, more exactly, performed. Let us bow our heads to  the inevitable; the day of encyclopaedic learning has gone by. It may  perhaps be said that that sun set with Leibnitz. But as little learning  is only dangerous when it forgets that it is little, so specialism is  only dangerous when it forgets that it is special. When it encroaches  on its betters, when it claims exceptional certainty or honor, it is  impertinent, and should be rebuked; but it has its own honor in its  own province, and is, in any case, to be preferred to pretentious and  flaunting sciolism.    A vast, even a bewildering prospect is before us, for evil or for good;  but for good, unless it be our own fault, far more than for evil. Books  require no eulogy from me; none could be permitted me, when they already  draw their testimonials from Cicero[4] and Macaulay.[5] But books are  the voices of the dead. They are a main instrument of communion with  the vast human procession of the other world. They are the allies of the  thought of man. They are in a certain sense at enmity with the world.  Their work is, at least, in the two higher compartments of our threefold  life. In a room well filled with them, no one has felt or can feel  solitary. Second to none, as friends to the individual, they are first  and foremost among the compages, the bonds and rivets of the race,  onward from that time when they were first written on the tablets of  Babylonia and Assyria, the rocks of Asia minor, and the monuments of  Egypt, down to the diamond editions of Mr. Pickering and Mr. Frowde.[6]    It is in truth difficult to assign dimensions for the libraries of the  future. And it is also a little touching to look back upon those of the  past. As the history of bodies cannot, in the long run, be separated  from the history of souls, I make no apology for saying a few words on  the libraries which once were, but which have passed away.    The time may be approaching when we shall be able to estimate the  quantity of book knowledge stored in the repositories of those empires  which we call prehistoric. For the present, no clear estimate even of  the great Alexandrian Libraries has been brought within the circle  of popular knowledge; but it seems pretty clear that the books they  contained were reckoned, at least in the aggregate, by hundreds of  thousands.[7] The form of the book, however, has gone through many  variations; and we moderns have a great advantage in the shape which the  exterior has now taken. It speaks to us symbolically by the title on its  back, as the roll of parchment could hardly do. It is established that  in Roman times the bad institution of slavery ministered to a system  under which books were multiplied by simultaneous copying in a room  where a single person read aloud in the hearing of many the volume to  be reproduced, and that so produced they were relatively cheap. Had they  not been so, they would hardly have been, as Horace represents them,  among the habitual spoils of the grocer.[8] It is sad, and is suggestive  of many inquiries, that this abundance was followed, at least in the  West, by a famine of more than a thousand years. And it is hard, even  after all allowances, to conceive that of all the many manuscripts  of Homer which Italy must have possessed we do not know that a single  parchment or papyrus was ever read by a single individual, even in a  convent, or even by a giant such as Dante, or as Thomas Acquinas, the  first of them unquestionably master of all the knowledge that was within  the compass of his age. There were, however, libraries even in the West,  formed by Charlemagne and by others after him. We are told that Alcuin,  in writing to the great monarch, spoke with longing of the relative  wealth of England in these precious estates. Mr. Edwards, whom I have  already quoted, mentions Charles the Fifth of France, in 1365, as a  collector of manuscripts. But some ten years back the Director of the  Bibliotheque Nationale informed me that the French King John collected  twelve hundred manuscripts, at that time an enormous library, out of  which several scores were among the treasures in his care. Mary of  Medicis appears to have amassed in the sixteenth century, probably with  far less effort, 5,800 volumes.[9] Oxford had before that time received  noble gifts for her University Library. And we have to recollect with  shame and indignation that that institution was"]]]
