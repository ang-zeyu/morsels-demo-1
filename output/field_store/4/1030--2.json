(BOB) SANDERS, STATE PRINTER  TOPEKA, KANSAS  1966    31-5378          Systematic Status of a South American Frog,  Allophryne ruthveni Gaige    BY    JOHN D. LYNCH AND HOWARD L. FREEMAN      Gaige (1926) described _Allophryne ruthveni_ as a new genus and species  of diminutive bufonid from British Guiana. Noble (1931) considered _A.  ruthveni_ to be a toothless relative of _Centrolenella_ and placed the  genus in the Hylidae. Gallardo (1965) suggested that _Allophryne_ is a  leptodactylid of uncertain affinities. Other references to the  monotypic genus have consisted only of a listing of the name or of its  inclusion in a key. To date the holotype and one paratype (both  females) have been reported (Gaige, 1926), and the family position of  the genus remains unsettled.    A male of _Allophryne ruthveni_ is among the amphibians and reptiles  collected in southern British Guiana by William A. Bentley in January,  1962, and deposited in the Museum of Natural History at The University  of Kansas (KU). Four additional specimens (females) are in the American  Museum of Natural History; only one of the latter has definite locality  data.         _Acknowledgments._--We are grateful to Dr. Ernest E.       Williams, Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) and Dr.       Richard G. Zweifel, American Museum of Natural History       (AMNH) for the loan of specimens. We are further indebted to       Dr. Zweifel for permission to clear and stain one specimen.       Dr. William E. Duellman and Linda Trueb offered many       constructive criticisms. Miss Trueb executed the drawings of       the skull and finger bones. Mr. Martin Wiley provided x-ray       photographs of _Allophryne_.      METHODS AND MATERIALS         Six of the seven known specimens were available for study.       Measurements were taken in the manner described by Duellman       (1956). One specimen was cleared and stained, using the       technique of Davis and Gore (1936), in order to study the       skeleton. X-ray photographs were made of another specimen       for comparison.         _Specimens examined._--Six, as follows: BRITISH GUIANA,       _Dist. Demarara_: Marudi Creek, AMNH 44749; _Dist. Equibo_:       Tumatumari, MCZ 11790 (paratype); _Dist. Rupununi_       (_Berbice_): Wai Wai Country, N of Acarahy Mountains, west       of New River (2 deg.N, 58 deg.W), KU 69890. Also, 3 specimens from       \"probably British Guiana,\" AMNH 70108-10 (70110 cleared and       stained).      SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT    The availability of additional material and the new information  pertaining to osteology permit an amplification of Gaige's (1926)  description.

N.       Clarke.         _Diagnosis._--Fingers free; toes two-thirds webbed; no       supernumerary tubercles on soles or palms; no tarsal fold;       elongate anal sheath, anal opening on lower surface of       thighs; head broad, interorbital space 2.5 times width of       upper eyelid; snout subacuminate in dorsal profile, strongly       sloping in lateral profile; tympanum visible in males,       concealed in females; venter areolate.         _External Morphology._--(Fig. 1) _Additional features not       mentioned in diagnoses_: Head wider than long, about as wide       as body; supratympanic fold present; canthus rostralis       rounded, loreal region slightly concave, nearly vertical;       nostril at tip of snout; pupil horizontal; no teeth on       maxillary, premaxillary, or vomer; tongue small, round,       thick, not notched behind, free posteriorly for one-sixth of       length; choanae large, only partly visible from directly       below; males having darkened subgular vocal sac; vocal slits       present in male.         Axillary membrane lacking or but slightly developed; no       tubercles or ridge under forearm; two palmar tubercles;       subarticular tubercles small, simple, round, flattened; tips       of fingers slightly expanded, T-shaped, with prominent       transverse groove; first finger shorter than second (stated       as longer than second in diagnosis by Gaige, 1926:2); folds       extending laterally from anus for a short distance, then       downward to venter of thighs; no appendage on heel, no inner       or outer tarsal folds or tubercles; inner metatarsal       tubercle oval, about twice as long as wide; outer metatarsal       tubercle nearly absent; no supernumerary tubercle on sole;       subarticular tubercles on foot small, round, simple, and       diffuse; toes T-shaped, slightly wider than digit; toes       about two-thirds webbed (Fig. 1d).         Skin of venter coarsely areolate; skin of flanks, throat,       chest, undersurfaces of arms, tibia, tarsi, dorsal surfaces       of thighs, tarsi, hands, and feet smooth; skin of dorsal       surfaces of tibia, forearm, back, and top and sides of head       having large horny pustules (sharply spinous in male).    [Illustration: FIG. 1. _Allophryne ruthveni_, male (KU 69890);  (_a_) Dorsum. (_b_) Thenar view of right hand. (_c_) Lateral profile of  head. (_d_) Plantar view of right foot. x 3.5.]         _Color._--Dorsum gray with irregular network of black lines       and elongate blotches; flanks and labial region black with       large white ocelli; dorsal surfaces of limbs gray, marked as       follows: two large, elongate white spots on each thigh,       concealed white spot on base of upper arm, black-edged gray       transverse bars on forearms and shanks, white spot on each       knee and elbow; ventral surfaces pale gray; black-edged       white spot on ventral surface of thigh on each side of anal       opening; chin and throat dark gray with white spots; vocal       sac in male black (Fig. 1a and c).         Gaige (1926) briefly described the color, which conforms to       the above in all particulars. The paratype (MCZ 11790) has       lost the gray color after 40 years in preservation; now       (1966) the ground-color is cream-brown, and the dorsal       spotting, noted by Gaige as being black, is now brown.         The spots on the feet, tarsi, knees, thighs, flanks and       upper arm are white in preservative, but in life possibly       were red or yellow. These colors usually fade to white in       preservative. Red or yellow spots are common aposematic       colors in frogs.         _Variation._--Eight measurements were taken on each specimen       and four ratios were computed; these are summarized in Table       1. Gaige's illustration of the holotype shows that it has a       greatly reduced pattern, whereas the paratype and three of       the other five known specimens have relatively large and       numerous spots. The male (KU 69890) and one female (AMNH       70108) have a reduced pattern intermediate between that of       the holotype and the four other specimens.

DUELLMAN      Field studies on hylid frogs in southern Mexico and northern Central  America have resulted in the collection of numerous specimens of  _Ptychohyla_, a genus of hylid frogs heretofore poorly represented in  museum collections. Experience with the living frogs in their natural  habitats has been helpful in defining the species and in formulating  ideas concerning their relationships.    Taylor (1944) proposed the generic name _Ptychohyla_ for a new species  of frog, _Ptychohyla adipoventris_ [= _Ptychohyla leonhard-schultzei_  (Ahl)--_fide_ Duellman, 1960] from Agua del Obispo, Guerrero. Taylor  defined the genus as having large ventrolateral glands and horny  nuptial spines in males. Stuart (1954:169) discussed the generic  characters and pointed out that both the ventrolateral glands and horny  nuptial spines were seasonal in their development, being found only in  breeding males. Stuart then went on to describe _Ptychohyla  schmidtorum_, a species characterized by the absence of horny nuptial  spines in breeding males. My investigations of these frogs have  revealed the presence of two groups of species. In both groups breeding  males have large ventrolateral glands, but the two groups are easily  separated by four characters. The first group contains, among others,  _Ptychohyla leonhard-schultzei_, _euthysanota_, _spinipollex_, and  another species in the Mesa Central of Chiapas to which I tentatively  apply the name _Ptychohyla macrotympanum_ (Tanner), 1957. This group of  species is characterized by horny nuptial spines in breeding males,  presence of a tarsal fold, a call consisting of a single long note, and  tadpoles having lips not greatly expanded. The second group, as  recognized here, is characterized by the absence of horny nuptial  spines in breeding males, lack of a tarsal fold, a call consisting of a  series of short notes, and tadpoles having greatly expanded lips. In  this group belong _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ and the two species  described below.    Only the descriptions of the new species are given in this paper;  detailed comparisons, descriptions of osteological features, analyses  of calls, and discussions of relationships are reserved for a  forthcoming review of the entire genus.    In the spring of 1959, collections of amphibians and reptiles were made  in the cloud forests on the northern slopes of the Sierra Madre  Oriental in northern Oaxaca. Among the hylids found, two specimens of a  heretofore unnamed species of _Ptychohyla_ have brilliant red  flash-colors on the groin and thighs; in allusion to these fiery colors  I propose that this species be named:    ~_Ptychohyla ignicolor_~ new species    (Plate 25, Fig. 1)         _Holotype._--University of Michigan Museum of Zoology No.       119603, from a stream 6 kilometers south of Vista Hermosa,       Oaxaca, Mexico (1865 meters); obtained on March 31, 1959, by       Thomas E. Moore. Original Number WED 14159.         _Paratype._--UMMZ 119602 from Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca (1500       meters); obtained on March 30, 1959, by William E. Duellman.         _Diagnosis._--A species of the _schmidtorum_-group of       _Ptychohyla_ differing from other known members of the group       in having the diameter of the tympanum less than one-half       the diameter of the eye, no white spot below the eye, no       lateral light stripe, bright green dorsum in life and red       flash-colors on groin and thighs.         _Description of Holotype._--Adult male having a snout-vent       length of 30.0 mm.; tibia length, 14.6 mm.; tibia       length/snout-vent length, 48.7 per cent; foot length       (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to       tip of longest toe), 12.3 mm.; head length, 9.2 mm.; head       length/snout-vent length, 32.3 per cent; head width, 9.3       mm.; head width/snout-vent length, 31.0 per cent; diameter       of eye, 3.2 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 1.3 mm.;       tympanum/eye, 40.6 per cent. Snout in lateral profile       square, in dorsal profile obtusely rounded; canthus       pronounced; loreal region slightly concave; lips moderately       flaring; top of head flat; nostrils protuberant; internarial       distance, 2.8 mm.; interorbital distance, 3.3 mm., much       broader than width of eyelid, 2.8 mm. A heavy dermal fold       from posterior corner of eye above tympanum to insertion of       forelimb, covering upper edge of tympanum; tympanum       elliptical, its greatest diameter equal to its distance from       eye. Forearm robust with a distinct fold on wrist; pollex       moderately enlarged without nuptial spines; second and       fourth fingers equal in length; subarticular tubercles       round; none is bifid; disc of third finger slightly larger       than tympanum; no web between first and second fingers;       vestige of web between other fingers. Heels overlap when       hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extends to       anterior corner of eye; no tarsal fold; inner metatarsal       tubercle large, flat, and elliptical; outer metatarsal       tubercle near inner one and triangular; subarticular       tubercles round; length of digits from shortest to longest       1-2-5-3-4; toes about one-half webbed; discs smaller on toes       than on fingers. Anal opening directed posteriorly at upper       level of thighs; no anal flap; pair of large tubercles below       anal opening; small tubercles ventral and lateral to these.       Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of limbs smooth, that of       throat and belly granular. Ventrolateral glands noticeably       thickened, extending from axilla nearly to groin and only       narrowly separated medially on chest. Skin of anterior part       of chin thickened and glandular. Tongue cordiform, shallowly       notched behind and only slightly free posteriorly; vomerine       teeth 0-3, situated on rounded elevations between somewhat       larger, round inner nares; openings to vocal sac large, one       situated along posterior margin of each mandibular ramus.    PLATE 25    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Paratype of _Ptychohyla ignicolor_  (UMMZ 119602). x 3.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Holotype of _Ptychohyla chamulae_  (KU 58063). x 3.]         Color (in alcohol) dull brown above with irregular dark       brown blotches; dorsal surfaces of limbs brown with narrow       darker brown transverse bars; posterior surfaces of thighs       cream-color with brown spots and mottling; groin and dorsal       surfaces of first and second toes white; belly       cream-colored; glandular areas orange-brown; chest and chin       having black spots. Ventral surfaces of hind limbs and first       toes cream-colored; undersides of other toes and soles of       feet brown.         Color (in life) uniform bright green above; venter pale       creamy yellow; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs,       ventral surfaces of shanks, anterior surfaces of tarsi and       upper proximal surfaces of first three toes red; iris pale       golden color.         The paratype is an adult male, having a snout-vent length of       26.3 mm., and agrees with the holotype in proportions. The       ventrolateral glands are less extensive and the chin less       spotted than in the holotype.         _Comparisons_: Both _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ and the species       described below differ from _P. ignicolor_ in lacking red       flash-colors and in having a white spot below the eye.       _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ also differs in having a small       tympanum. As stated above, these species can be       distinguished from the rest of the genus by the absence of a       tarsal fold and absence of horny nuptial spines in breeding       males.         _Remarks_: The holotype was found on a moss-covered log over       a stream in dense cloud forest by day. The paratype was       calling at night from a low herb at the edge of a small       stream in the cloud forest. Nearby a _Ptychohyla       leonhard-schultzei_ was calling.    Along two cascading mountain streams in cloud forest on the northern  slopes of the Mesa Central in central Chiapas numerous specimens of a  distinctive species of _Ptychohyla_ were found in association with two  species of _Hyla_ and two of _Plectrohyla_. The first specimen of this  new species of _Ptychohyla_ was discovered by Dale L. Hoyt, who found  the frog on a rock at midday. At night on August 5, 1960, numerous  individuals were found calling from leaves of plants growing on the  slopes of the ravine by the streams. None was more than two meters  above the ground. Tadpoles were found in the fast-flowing stream, where  they were holding onto rocks with their mouths. Little is known of the  herpetofauna of these mountains that are the home of the Chamula  Indians. Since the little frog described here comes from the land of  the Chamulas, I propose that it be named:    ~_Ptychohyla chamulae_~ new species    (Plate 25, Fig. 2)         _Holotype._--University of Kansas Museum of Natural History       No. 58063, from a stream above (6.2 kilometers by road       south) Rayon Mescalapa, Chiapas, Mexico (1690 meters); one   "]]]
