FOREWORD      The closing paragraphs of this book were written in the late summer of  1914, when the armies of every great power in Europe were being  mobilised for savage, unsparing, barbarous warfare--against one another,  against small and unaggressive nations, against helpless women and  children, against civilisation itself. How mild, by comparison with the  despatches in the daily newspapers, will seem this chronicle of women's  militant struggle against political and social injustice in one small  corner of Europe. Yet let it stand as it was written, with  peace--so-called, and civilisation, and orderly government as the  background for heroism such as the world has seldom witnessed. The  militancy of men, through all the centuries, has drenched the world with  blood, and for these deeds of horror and destruction men have been  rewarded with monuments, with great songs and epics. The militancy of  women has harmed no human life save the lives of those who fought the  battle of righteousness. Time alone will reveal what reward will be  allotted to the women.    This we know, that in the black hour that has just struck in Europe, the  men are turning to their women and calling on them to take up the work  of keeping civilisation alive. Through all the harvest fields, in  orchards and vineyards, women are garnering food for the men who fight,  as well as for the children left fatherless by war. In the cities the  women are keeping open the shops, they are driving trucks and trams, and  are altogether attending to a multitude of business.    When the remnants of the armies return, when the commerce of Europe is  resumed by men, will they forget the part the women so nobly played?  Will they forget in England how women in all ranks of life put aside  their own interests and organised, not only to nurse the wounded, care  for the destitute, comfort the sick and lonely, but actually to maintain  the existence of the nation? Thus far, it must be admitted, there are  few indications that the English Government are mindful of the unselfish  devotion manifested by the women. Thus far all Government schemes for  overcoming unemployment have been directed towards the unemployment of  men. The work of women, making garments, etc., has in some cases been  taken away.    At the first alarm of war the militants proclaimed a truce, which was  answered half-heartedly by the announcement that the Government would  release all suffrage prisoners who would give an undertaking \"not to  commit further crimes or outrages.\" Since the truce had already been  proclaimed, no suffrage prisoner deigned to reply to the Home  Secretary's provision. A few days later, no doubt influenced by  representations made to the Government by men and women of every  political faith--many of them never having been supporters of  revolutionary tactics--Mr. McKenna announced in the House of Commons  that it was the intention of the Government, within a few days, to  release unconditionally, all suffrage prisoners. So ends, for the  present, the war of women against men. As of old, the women become the  nurturing mothers of men, their sisters and uncomplaining helpmates. The  future lies far ahead, but let this preface and this volume close with  the assurance that the struggle for the full enfranchisement of women  has not been abandoned; it has simply, for the moment, been placed in  abeyance. When the clash of arms ceases, when normal, peaceful, rational  society resumes its functions, the demand will again be made. If it is  not quickly granted, then once more the women will take up the arms they  to-day generously lay down. There can be no real peace in the world  until woman, the mother half of the human family, is given liberty in  the councils of the world.          BOOK I    THE MAKING OF A MILITANT      Mrs. Pankhurst's Own Story          CHAPTER I      Those men and women are fortunate who are born at a time when a great  struggle for human freedom is in progress. It is an added good fortune  to have parents who take a personal part in the great movements of their  time. I am glad and thankful that this was my case.    One of my earliest recollections is of a great bazaar which was held in  my native city of Manchester, the object of the bazaar being to raise  money to relieve the poverty of the newly emancipated negro slaves in  the United States. My mother took an active part in this effort, and I,  as a small child, was entrusted with a lucky bag by means of which I  helped to collect money.    Young as I was--I could not have been older than five years--I knew  perfectly well the meaning of the words slavery and emancipation. From  infancy I had been accustomed to hear pro and con discussions of slavery  and the American Civil War. Although the British government finally  decided not to recognise the Confederacy, public opinion in England was  sharply divided on the questions both of slavery and of secession.  Broadly speaking, the propertied classes were pro-slavery, but there  were many exceptions to the rule. Most of those who formed the circle  of our family friends were opposed to slavery, and my father, Robert  Goulden, was always a most ardent abolitionist. He was prominent enough  in the movement to be appointed on a committee to meet and welcome Henry  Ward Beecher when he arrived in England for a lecture tour. Mrs. Harriet  Beecher Stowe's novel, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" was so great a favourite  with my mother that she used it continually as a source of bedtime  stories for our fascinated ears. Those stories, told almost fifty years  ago, are as fresh in my mind to-day as events detailed in the morning's  papers. Indeed they are more vivid, because they made a much deeper  impression on my consciousness. I can still definitely recall the thrill  I experienced every time my mother related the tale of Eliza's race for  freedom over the broken ice of the Ohio River, the agonizing pursuit,  and the final rescue at the hands of the determined old Quaker. Another  thrilling tale was the story of a negro boy's flight from the plantation  of his cruel master. The boy had never seen a railroad train, and when,  staggering along the unfamiliar railroad track, he heard the roar of an  approaching train, the clattering car-wheels seemed to his strained  imagination to be repeating over and over again the awful words, \"Catch  a nigger--catch a nigger--catch a nigger--\" This was a terrible story,  and throughout my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901"],[0,"On Liberty (#1)"],[1,"Liberty.

I.    John Stuart Mill was born on 20th May 1806. He was a delicate child, and  the extraordinary education designed by his father was not calculated to  develop and improve his physical powers. \"I never was a boy,\" he says;  \"never played cricket.\" His exercise was taken in the form of walks with  his father, during which the elder Mill lectured his son and examined  him on his work. It is idle to speculate on the possible results of a  different treatment. Mill remained delicate throughout his life, but was  endowed with that intense mental energy which is so often combined with  physical weakness. His youth was sacrificed to an idea; he was designed  by his father to carry on his work; the individuality of the boy was  unimportant. A visit to the south of France at the age of fourteen, in  company with the family of General Sir Samuel Bentham, was not without  its influence. It was a glimpse of another atmosphere, though the  studious habits of his home life were maintained. Moreover, he derived  from it his interest in foreign politics, which remained one of his  characteristics to the end of his life. In 1823 he was appointed junior  clerk in the Examiners' Office at the India House.    Mill's first essays were written in the _Traveller_ about a year before  he entered the India House. From that time forward his literary work was  uninterrupted save by attacks of illness. His industry was stupendous.  He wrote articles on an infinite variety of subjects, political,  metaphysical, philosophic, religious, poetical. He discovered Tennyson  for his generation, he influenced the writing of Carlyle's _French  Revolution_ as well as its success. And all the while he was engaged in  studying and preparing for his more ambitious works, while he rose step  by step at the India Office. His _Essays on Unsettled Questions in  Political Economy_ were written in 1831, although they did not appear  until thirteen years later. His _System of Logic_, the design of which  was even then fashioning itself in his brain, took thirteen years to  complete, and was actually published before the _Political Economy_. In  1844 appeared the article on Michelet, which its author anticipated  would cause some discussion, but which did not create the sensation he  expected. Next year there were the \"Claims of Labour\" and \"Guizot,\" and  in 1847 his articles on Irish affairs in the _Morning Chronicle_. These  years were very much influenced by his friendship and correspondence  with Comte, a curious comradeship between men of such different  temperament. In 1848 Mill published his _Political Economy_, to which he  had given his serious study since the completion of his _Logic_. His  articles and reviews, though they involved a good deal of work--as, for  instance, the re-perusal of the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ in the  original before reviewing Grote's _Greece_--were recreation to the  student. The year 1856 saw him head of the Examiners' Office in the  India House, and another two years brought the end of his official work,  owing to the transfer of India to the Crown. In the same year his wife  died. _Liberty_ was published shortly after, as well as the _Thoughts on  Parliamentary Reform_, and no year passed without Mill making important  contributions on the political, philosophical, and ethical questions of  the day.    Seven years after the death of his wife, Mill was invited to contest  Westminster. His feeling on the conduct of elections made him refuse to  take any personal action in the matter, and he gave the frankest  expression to his political views, but nevertheless he was elected by a  large majority. He was not a conventional success in the House; as a  speaker he lacked magnetism. But his influence was widely felt. \"For the  sake of the House of Commons at large,\" said Mr. Gladstone, \"I rejoiced  in his advent and deplored his disappearance. He did us all good.\" After  only three years in Parliament, he was defeated at the next General  Election by Mr. W. H. Smith. He retired to Avignon, to the pleasant  little house where the happiest years of his life had been spent in the  companionship of his wife, and continued his disinterested labours. He  completed his edition of his father's _Analysis of the Mind_, and also  produced, in addition to less important work, _The Subjection of Women_,  in which he had the active co-operation of his step-daughter. A book on  Socialism was under consideration, but, like an earlier study of  Sociology, it never was written. He died in 1873, his last years being  spent peacefully in the pleasant society of his step-daughter, from  whose tender care and earnest intellectual sympathy he caught maybe a  far-off reflection of the light which had irradiated his spiritual life.      II.    The circumstances under which John Stuart Mill wrote his _Liberty_ are  largely connected with the influence which Mrs. Taylor wielded over his  career. The dedication is well known. It contains the most extraordinary  panegyric on a woman that any philosopher has ever penned. \"Were I but  capable of interpreting to the world one-half the great thoughts and  noble feelings which are buried in her grave, I should be the medium of  a greater benefit to it than is ever likely to arise from anything that  I can write, unprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivalled  wisdom.\" It is easy for the ordinary worldly cynicism to curl a  sceptical lip over sentences like these. There may be exaggeration of  sentiment, the necessary and inevitable reaction of a man who was  trained according to the \"dry light\" of so unimpressionable a man as  James Mill, the father; but the passage quoted is not the only one in  which John Stuart Mill proclaims his unhesitating belief in the  intellectual influence of his wife. The treatise on _Liberty_ was  written especially under her authority and encouragement, but there are  many earlier references to the power which she exercised over his mind.  Mill was introduced to her as early as 1831, at a dinner-party at Mr.  Taylor's house, where were present, amongst others, Roebuck, W. J. Fox,  and Miss Harriet Martineau. The acquaintance rapidly ripened into  intimacy and the intimacy into friendship, and Mill was never weary of  expatiating on all the advantages of so singular a relationship. In some  of the presentation copies of his work on _Political Economy_, he wrote  the following dedication:--\"To Mrs. John Taylor, who, of all persons  known to the author, is the most highly qualified either to originate or  to appreciate speculation on social advancement, this work is with the  highest respect and esteem dedicated.\" An article on the enfranchisement  of women was made the occasion for another encomium. We shall hardly be  wrong in attributing a much later book, _The Subjection of Women_,  published in 1869, to the influence wielded by Mrs. Taylor. Finally, the  pages of the _Autobiography_ ring with the dithyrambic praise of his  \"almost infallible counsellor.\"    The facts of this remarkable intimacy can easily be stated. The  deductions are more difficult. There is no question that Mill's  infatuation was the cause of considerable trouble to his acquaintances  and friends. His father openly taxed him with being in love with another  man's wife. Roebuck, Mrs. Grote, Mrs. Austin, Miss Harriet Martineau  were amongst those who suffered because they made some allusion to a  forbidden subject. Mrs. Taylor lived with her daughter in a lodging in  the country; but in 1851 her husband died, and then Mill made her his  wife. Opinions were widely divergent as to her merits; but every one  agreed that up to the time of her death, in 1858, Mill was wholly lost  to his friends. George Mill, one of Mill's younger brothers, gave it as  his opinion that she was a clever and remarkable woman, but \"nothing  like what John took her to be.\" Carlyle, in his reminiscences, described  her with ambiguous epithets. She was \"vivid,\" \"iridescent,\" \"pale and  passionate and sad-looking, a living-romance heroine of the royalist  volition and questionable destiny.\" It is not possible to make much of a  judgment like this, but we get on more certain ground when we discover  that Mrs. Carlyle said on one occasion that \"she is thought to be  dangerous,\" and that Carlyle added that she was worse than dangerous,  she was patronising. The occasion when Mill and his wife were brought  into close contact with the Carlyles is well known. The manuscript of  the first volume of the _French Revolution_ had been lent to Mill, and  was accidentally burnt by Mrs. Mill's servant. Mill and his wife drove  up to Carlyle's door, the wife speechless, the husband so full of  conversation that he detained Carlyle with desperate attempts at  loquacity for two hours. But Dr. Garnett tells us, in his _Life of"]]]
