Henty          PREFACE.      MY DEAR LADS,    This time only a few words are needed, for the story speaks for  itself. My object has been rather to tell you a tale of interest  than to impart historical knowledge, for the facts of the dreadful  time when \"the terror\" reigned supreme in France are well known to  all educated lads. I need only say that such historical allusions as  are necessary for the sequence of the story will be found correct,  except that the Noyades at Nantes did not take place until a somewhat  later period than is here assigned to them.

Yes, I am certainly thinking of it, though I  haven't at all made up my mind. There are advantages and disadvantages.\"    \"Oh, but it is such a long way, and to live among those French people,  who have been doing such dreadful things, attacking the Bastille,  and, as I have heard you say, passing all sorts of revolutionary  laws, and holding their king and queen almost as prisoners in  Paris!\"    \"Well, they won't eat him, my dear. The French Assembly, or the  National Assembly, or whatever it ought to be called, has certainly  been passing laws limiting the power of the king and abolishing  many of the rights and privileges of the nobility and clergy; but  you must remember that the condition of the vast body of the French  nation has been terrible. We have long conquered our liberties,  and, indeed, never even in the height of the feudal system were the  mass of the English people more enslaved as have been the peasants  of France.    \"We must not be surprised, therefore, if in their newly-recovered  freedom they push matters to an excess at first; but all this will  right itself, and no doubt a constitutional form of government,  somewhat similar to our own, will be established. But all this is  no reason against Harry's going out there. You don't suppose that  the French people are going to fly at the throats of the nobility.  Why, even in the heat of the civil war here there was no instance  of any personal wrong being done to the families of  those engaged  in the struggle, and in only two or three cases, after repeated  risings, were any even of the leaders executed.    \"No; Harry will be just as safe there as he would be here. As to  the distance, it's nothing like so far as if he went to India, for  example.  I don't see any great chance of his setting the Thames  on fire at home.  His school report is always the same--'Conduct  fair; progress in study moderate'--which means, as I take it, that  he just scrapes along. That's it, isn't it, Harry?\"    \"Yes, father, I think so. You see every one cannot be at the top  of the form.\"    \"That's a very true observation, my boy. It is clear that if there  are twenty boys in a class, nineteen fathers have to be disappointed.  Still, of course, one would like to be the father who is not  disappointed.\"    \"I stick to my work,\" the boy said; \"but there are always fellows  who seem to know just the right words without taking any trouble  about it. It comes to them, I suppose.\"    \"What do you say to this idea yourself, Harry?\"    \"I don't know, sir,\" the boy said doubtfully.    \"And I don't know,\" his father agreed. \"At anyrate we will sleep  upon it. I am clear that the offer is not to be lightly rejected.\"    Dr. Sandwith was a doctor in Chelsea. Chelsea in the year 1790  was a very different place to Chelsea of the present day. It was a  pretty suburban hamlet, and was indeed a very fashionable quarter.  Here many of the nobility and personages connected with the court  had their houses, and broad country fields and lanes separated it  from the stir and din of London. Dr. Sandwith had a good practice,  but he had also a large family. Harry was at Westminster, going  backwards and forwards across the fields to school. So far he had  evinced no predilection for any special career. He was a sturdy,  well-built lad of some sixteen years old. He was, as his father  said, not likely to set the Thames on fire in any way. He was as  undistinguished in the various sports popular among boys in those  days as he was in his lessons. He was as good as the average, but  no better; had fought some tough fights with boys of his own age,  and had shown endurance rather than brilliancy.    In the ordinary course of things he would probably in three or four  years' time have chosen some profession; and, indeed, his father  had already settled in his mind that as Harry was not likely to  make any great figure in life in the way of intellectual capacity,  the best thing would be to obtain for him a commission in his  Majesty's service, as to which, with the doctor's connection among  people of influence, there would not be any difficulty. He had,  however, said nothing as yet to the boy on the subject.    The fact that Harry had three younger brothers and four sisters,  and that Dr. Sandwith, who was obliged to keep up a good position,  sometimes found it difficult to meet his various expenses, made  him perhaps more inclined to view favourably the offer he had  that morning received than would otherwise have been the case. Two  years before he had attended professionally a young French nobleman  attached to the embassy. It was from him that the letter which  had been the subject of conversation had been received. It ran as  follows:      \"Dear Doctor Sandwith,--Since my return from Paris  I have frequently spoken to my brother, the Marquis of St. Caux,  respecting the difference of education between your English boys  and our own.  Nothing struck me more when I was in London than your  great schools. With us the children of good families are almost  always brought up at home. They learn to dance and to fence, but  have no other exercise for their limbs, and they lack the air of  manly independence which struck me in English boys. They are more  gentil--I do not know the word in your language which expresses  it--they carry themselves better; they are not so rough; they are  more polite. There are advantages in both systems, but for myself I  like yours much the best. My brother is, to some extent, a convert  to my view. There are no such schools to which he could send his sons  in France, for what large schools we have are under the management  of the fathers, and the boys have none of that freedom which is  the distinguishing point of the English system of education. Even  if there were such schools, I am sure that madame my sister-in-law  would never hear of her sons being sent there.    \"Since this is so, the marquis has concluded that the best thing  would be to have an English boy of good family as their companion.  He would, of course, study with them under their masters. He would  play and ride with them, and would be treated as one of themselves.  They would learn something of English from him, which would  be useful if they adopt the diplomatic profession. He would learn  French, which might also be useful to him; but of course the great  point which my brother desires is that his sons should acquire  something of the manly independence of thought and action which  distinguishes English boys.    \"Having arranged this much, I thought of you. I know that you have  several sons. If you have one of from fourteen to sixteen years,  and you would like him to take such a position for two or three  years, I should be glad indeed to secure such a companion for my  nephews. If not, would you do me the favour of looking round among  your acquaintances and find us a lad such as we need. He must be  a gentleman and a fair type of the boy we are speaking of. I may  say that my brother authorizes me to offer in his name, in addition  to all expenses, two thousand francs a year to the young gentleman  who will thus benefit his sons. I do not think that the political  excitement which is agitating Paris need be taken into consideration.  Now that great concessions have been made to the representatives  of the nation, it is not at all probable that there will be any  recurrence of such popular tumults as that which brought about the  capture of the Bastille. But in any case this need not weigh in  the decision, as my brother resides for the greater part of the  year in his chateau near Dijon in Burgundy, far removed from the  troubles in the capital.\"      The more Dr. Sandwith thought over the matter the more he liked it.  There were comparatively few Englishmen in those days who spoke the  French language. It was, indeed, considered part of the education  of a young man of good family to make what was called the grand  tour of Europe under the charge of a tutor, after leaving the  university. But these formed a very small proportion of society,  and, indeed, the frequent wars which had, since the Stuarts lost the  throne of England, occurred between the two countries had greatly  interfered with continental travel.    Even now the subjects of France and England were engaged in a  desperate struggle in India, although there was peace between the  courts of Versailles and St. James's. A knowledge of the French  language then would be likely to be of great utility to Harry if  he entered the army; his expenses at Westminster would be saved,  and the two hundred and forty pounds which he would acquire during  his three years' stay in France would "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net                    =By Charles Bradford=          =The Determined Angler=        \"Most sensible volume of its kind.\"--Grover      Cleveland. 12º. illustrated.

How delightful in the  early spring, after the dull and tedious time of winter, when the  frosts disappear and the sunshine warms the earth and waters, to  wander forth by some clear stream, to see the leaf bursting from the  purple bud, to scent the odors of the bank perfumed by the violet, and  enameled, as it were, with the primrose and the daisy; to wander upon  the fresh turf below the shade of trees, whose bright blossoms are  filled with the music of the bee; and on the surface of the waters to  view the gaudy flies sparkling like animated gems in the sunbeams,  whilst the bright and beautiful trout is watching them from below; to  hear the twittering of the water-birds, who, alarmed at your approach,  rapidly hide themselves beneath the flowers and leaves of the  water-lily; and as the season advances, to find all these objects  changed for others of the same kind, but better and brighter, till the  swallow and the trout contend as it were for the gaudy May fly, and  till in pursuing your amusement in the calm and balmy evening, you are  serenaded by the songs of the cheerful thrush ... performing the  offices of paternal love, in thickets ornamented with the rose and  woodbine.\"--_Days of Fly Fishing, 1828._    \"Gentlemen, let not prejudice prepossess you. I confess my discourse  is like to prove suitable to my recreation, calm and quiet.... And so  much for the prologue of what I mean to say-\"        Izaak Walton    [Illustration]          PREFACE    \"Don't give up if you don't catch fish; the unsuccessful trip should  whet your appetite to try again.\"--GROVER CLEVELAND.      A preface is either an excuse or an explanation, or both. The Brook  Trout needs no excuse, and it is fully explained in the general text  of this volume. Nor does the Angler, be he Determined or otherwise,  need any excuse, because \"our Saviour chose simple fishermen ... St.  Peter, St. John, St. Andrew, and St. James, whom he inspired, and He  never reproved these for their employment or calling\" (Izaak Walton,  _The Compleat Angler_, 1653). And the Angler--the man--needs no  explanation, though it seems ever necessary to define the word.    Webster, himself a profound Angler, must have been unconscious of his  gentle bearing, for his definition of \"angle\" is simply: \"to fish,\"  and every Angler knows that merely to fish--to go forth indifferent of  correct (humane) tackle, the legal season, and ethical methods in the  pursuit--is not the way of the Angler.    I like the explanation of the word by Genio C. Scott: \"Angling, a  special kind of fishing.\"    The inspired landscape genius and the kalsominer who shellacs the  artist's studio are both painters; so, the gentle Angler with perfect  tackle and the mere hand-line fish taker are both fishermen.    The Angler is the highest order of fisherman, and while all Anglers  are fishermen there are many fishermen who are not Anglers.    \"Anglo-Saxon,\" writing in the New York _Press_. October 14, 1915, uses  the term \"gentleman Anglers.\" He should have said \"gentleman  fishermen\" (Anglers), because all Anglers are gentlemen, regardless of  their business calling, appearance, personality, companionship, etc.  When a man, fisherman or no fisherman, develops into an Angler he must  first become gentle in order to be of the gentle art. \"Angling is the  gentle art\" (Walton). \"The gentle art of angling\" (Cotton).    \"If true Anglers,\" says Genio C. Scott, \"you are sure to be gentle.\"    Peter Flint (New York _Press_, Oct. 15, 1915): \"Our most successful  Anglers, amateurs as well as professionals.\"    All Anglers are amateurs, brother Peter. There are no professional  Anglers, though there are both amateur and professional fishermen, and  those fishermen who are amateurs are Anglers. The word \"amateur\" seems  to be adrift upon the same bewildering tideway as the words \"angler\"  and \"angling.\" \"Amateur\" hasn't the definition commonly attributed to  it--it doesn't signify inefficiency, inexperience, unpracticality,  etc., as do the words \"beginner,\" \"neophyte,\" \"tyro,\" etc. An amateur  in fishing, or farming, or any other pastime or pursuit, may be far  more practical, more experienced, more proficient, and better equipped  in tools and paraphernalia than a professional, and he usually is so;  he is certainly always so in angling.    Watch your word.    \"It is the belief of Acker that hand-line fishing is as good [as], if  not better than, the rod and reel kind.\" (Wandering Angler, New York  _Press_, Aug. 17, 1915.)    Hand-line fishing, as fishing,--though the Tuna Angling Club, of Santa  Catalina Island, California, is bound to the use of light rods and  fine reels and tells us hand-lines are unsportsmanlike and detrimental  to the public interest,--is good (Christ and His disciples sanctioned  it), but to say it is as good as or better than rod and reel angling  is not convincing. The indifferent fisher can't condemn angling in  praising common fishing with any more reason than he might proclaim  against cricket playing in favoring carpentry, or _vice versa_. One  might as correctly say hand-line fishing is as good as riding, or  driving, or golf, or baseball, or canoeing (of course it is), for  fishing without rod and reel and fishing with proper tackle are  pursuits as distinct in character as riding a plain horse bareback  with a rough halter, and straddling a gallant charger with neat bridle  and saddle; or as mere boating upon a refuse creek, and skimming the  green billows in a trim yacht.    That the fisher's hand-line and the fisherman's net will take _more_  fish than the Angler's tackle is not of moment, because a stick of  dynamite or a cannon filled with leaden pellets or a boy with a market  basket will take still more fish than the net and hand-line. Quantity  makes fishing \"good\" with the fisherman; quality delights the Angler.  There is no objection to the mere fish-getter filling his boat with  fishes with or without tackle, but as the jockey is separated from the  sportsman rider and the sailor from the yachtsman so should the  quantity fisher and the quality Angler be considered in contrasting  spheres. \"What a man brings home in his heart after fishing is of  more account than what he brings in his basket,\" says W. J. Long.  \"Anglers encourage the adoption of angling methods,\" says Dr. Van  Dyke, \"which make the wholesale slaughter of fishes impossible and  increase the sport of taking a fair number in a fair way.\"    As chivalric single-missile bow-and-arrow exercise dignifies archery  above bunch-arrow work in war, so the gentle use of refined tackle  dignifies angling above mere fish getting. Trap shooting is  delightful, and more birds are killed than the gunner would bag in  marsh and meadow, but is trap shooting therefore more \"good\" than  game-shooting in the glorious fields and forests? No, sir; and though  the hand-line fisherman may honestly take half the ocean's yield,  still his pursuit and his catch cannot equal and cannot be  legitimately compared to the code and the creel of the competent"]]]
