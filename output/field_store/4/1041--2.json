SMITH                                   Illustrated by DILLON    [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction  March 1958. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the  U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]          [Sidenote: _All the world's a stage, so there was room even for this bad  actor ... only he intended to direct it!_]      As Paul Lambrequin was clambering up the stairs of his rooming house, he  met a man whose face was all wrong. \"Good evening,\" Paul said politely  and was about to continue on his way when the man stopped him.    \"You are the first person I have encountered in this place who has not  shuttered at the sight of me,\" he said in a toneless voice with an  accent that was outside the standard repertoire.    \"Am I?\" Paul asked, bringing himself back from one of the roseate dreams  with which he kept himself insulated from a not-too-kind reality. \"I  daresay that's because I'm a bit near-sighted.\" He peered vaguely at  the stranger. Then he recoiled.    \"What is incorrect about me, then?\" the stranger demanded. \"Do I not  have two eyes, one nose and one mouth, the identical as other people?\"    Paul studied the other man. \"Yes, but somehow they seem to be put  together all wrong. Not that you can help it, of course,\" he added  apologetically, for, when he thought of it, he hated to hurt people's  feelings.    \"Yes, I can, for, of a truth, 'twas I who put myself together. What did  I do amiss?\"    Paul looked consideringly at him. \"I can't quite put my finger on it,  but there are certain subtle nuances you just don't seem to have caught.  If you want my professional advice, you'll model yourself directly on  some real person until you've got the knack of improvisation.\"    \"Like unto this?\" The stranger's outline shimmered and blurred into an  amorphous cloud, which then coalesced into the shape of a tall,  beautiful young man with the face of an ingenuous demon. \"Behold, is  that superior?\"    \"Oh, far superior!\" Paul reached up to adjust a stray lock of hair, then  realized he was not looking into a mirror. \"Trouble is--well, I'd rather  you chose someone else to model yourself on. You see, in my profession,  it's important to look as unique as possible; helps people remember you.  I'm an actor, you know. Currently I happen to be at liberty, but the  year before last--\"    \"Well, whom should I appear like? Should I perhaps pick some fine  upstanding figure from your public prints to emulate? Like your  President, perhaply?\"    \"I--hardly think so. It wouldn't do to model yourself on someone well  known--or even someone obscure whom you might just happen to run into  someday.\" Being a kind-hearted young man, Paul added, \"Come up to my  room. I have some British film magazines and there are lots of  relatively obscure English actors who are very decent-looking chaps.\"           *       *       *       *       *    So they climbed up to Paul's hot little room under the eaves and, after  leafing through several magazines, Paul chose one Ivo Darcy as a likely  candidate. Whereupon the stranger deliquesced and reformed into the  personable simulacrum of young Mr. Darcy.    \"That's quite a trick,\" Paul observed as it finally got through to him  what the other had done. \"It would come in handy in the profession--for  character parts, you know.\"    \"I fear you would never be able to acquisition it,\" the stranger said,  surveying his new self in the mirror complacently. \"It is not a trick  but a racial ableness. You see, I feel I can trust you--\"    \"--Of course I'm not really a character actor; I'm a leading man, but I  believe one should be versatile, because there are times when a really  good character part comes along--\"    \"--I am not a human being. I am a native of the fifth planet circulating  around the star you call Sirius, and we Sirians have the ableness to  change ourselves into the apparition of any other livid form--\"    \"I thought that might be a near-Eastern accent!\" Paul exclaimed,  diverted. \"Is Lebanese anything like it? Because I understand there's a  really juicy part coming up in--\"    \"I said _Sirian_, not _Syrian_; I do not come from Minor Asia but from  outer space, from an other-where solar system. I am an outworlder, an  extraterrestrial.\"    \"I hope you had a nice trip,\" Paul said politely. \"From Sirius, did you  say? What's the state of the theater there?\"    \"In its infanticide,\" the stranger told him, \"but--\"    \"Let's face it,\" Paul muttered bitterly, \"it's in its infancy here, too.  No over-all planning. No appreciation of the fact that all the  components that go to make up a production should be a continuing  totality, instead of a tenuous coalition of separate forces which  disintegrate--\"    \"You, I comprehend, are disemployed at current. I should--\"    \"You won't find that situation in Russia!\" Paul went on, pleased to  discover a sympathetic audience in this intelligent foreigner. \"Mind  you,\" he added quickly, \"I disapprove entirely of their politics. In  fact, I disapprove of all politics. But when it comes to the theater, in  many respects the Russians--\"    \"--Like to make a proposal to our mutual advanceage--\"    \"--You wouldn't find an actor there playing a lead role one season and  then not be able to get any parts except summer stock and odd bits for  the next two years. All right, so the show I had the lead in folded  after two weeks, but the critics all raved about my performance. It was  the play that stank!\"    \"Will you terminate the monologue and hearken unto me!\" the alien  shouted.    Paul stopped talking. His feelings were hurt. He had thought Ivo liked  him; now he saw all the outworlder wanted to do was talk about his own  problems.    \"I desire to extend to you a position,\" said Ivo.    \"I can't take a regular job,\" Paul said sulkily. \"I have to be available  for interviews. Fellow I knew took a job in a store and, when he was  called to read for a part, he couldn't get away. The fellow who did get  that part became a big star, and maybe the other fellow could have been  a star, too, but now all he is is a lousy chairman of the board of some  department store chain--\"    \"This work can be undergone at your convention between readings and  interviews, whenever you have the timing. I shall pay you beautifully,  being abundant with U.S.A. currency. I want you to teach me how to act.\"    \"Teach you how to act,\" Paul repeated, rather intrigued. \"Well, I'm not  a dramatic coach, you know; however, I do happen to have some ideas on  the subject. I feel that most acting teachers nowadays fail to give  their students a really thorough grounding in all aspects of the  dramatic art. All they talk about is method, method, method. But what  about technique?\"    \"I have observed your species with great diligence and I thought I had  acquisitioned your habits and speakings to perfectness. But I fear that,  like my initial face, I have got them awry. I want you to teach me to  act like a human being, to talk like a human being, to think like a  human being.\"    Paul's attention was really caught. \"Well, that _is_ a challenge! I  don't suppose Stanislavsky ever had to teach an extraterrestrial, or  even Strasberg--\"    \"Then we are in accordance,\" Ivo said. \"You will instruction me?\" He  essayed a smile.    Paul shuddered. \"Very well,\" he said. \"We'll start now. And I think the  first thing we'd better start with is lessons in smiling.\"    Ivo proved to be a quick study. He not only learned to smile, but to  frown and to express surprise, pleasure, horror--whatever the occasion  demanded. He learned the knack of counterfeiting humanity with such  skill that, Paul was moved to remark one afternoon when they were  leaving Brooks Brothers after a fitting, \"Sometimes you seem even more  human than I do, Ivo. I wish you'd watch out for that tendency to rant,  though. You're supposed to speak, not make speeches.\"    \"I try not to,\" Ivo said, \"but I keep getting carried away by  enthusiasm.\"    \"Apparently I have a real flair for teaching,\" Paul went on as, expertly  camouflaged by Brooks, the two young men melted into the dense  charcoal-gray underbrush of Madison Avenue. \"I seem to be even more  versatile than I thought. Perhaps I have been--well, not wasting but  limiting my talents.\"    \"That may be because your talents have not been sufficiently  appreciated,\" his star pupil suggested, \"or given enough scope.\"    Ivo was so perceptive! \"As a matter of fact,\" Paul agreed, \"it has often  seemed to me that if some really gifted individual, equally adept at  acting, directing, producing, playwriting, teaching, et al., were to  undertake a thorough synthesis of the theater--ah, but that would cost  money,\" he interrupted himself, \"and who would underwrite such a  project? Certainly not the government of the United States.\" He gave a  bitter laugh.    \"Perhaps, under a new regime, conditions might be more favorable for the  artist--\"    \"Shhh!\" Paul looked nervously over his shoulder. \"There are Senators  everywhere. Besides, I never said things were _good_ in Russia, just  _better_--for the actor, that is. Of course the plays are atrocious  propaganda--\"    \"I was not referring to another human regime. The human being is, at  best, save for certain choice spirits, unsympathetic to the arts. We  outworlders have a far greater respect for things of the mind.\"    Paul opened his mouth; Ivo continued without giving him a chance to  speak, \"No doubt you have often wondered just what I am doing here on  Earth?\"    The question had never crossed Paul's mind. Feeling vaguely guilty, he  murmured, \"Some people have funny ideas of where to go for a vacation.\"    \"I am here on business,\" Ivo told him. \"The situation on Sirius is  serious.\"    \"You know, that's catchy! 'The situation on Sirius is serious',\" Paul  repeated, tapping his foot. \"I've often"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],[0,"Rashi (#1)"],[1,"NOTES:   <I> ... </I> bracket italics in the original             <H> ... </H> bracket English transliterations of Hebrew               terms which appeared in this location in the               original text.

On that occasion those whose knowledge authorizes them to speak  gave eloquent accounts of his life and work.  Science and  devotion availed themselves of every possible medium-lectures and  books, journals and reviews-to set forth all we owe to the  illustrious Rabbi.  The writer ventures to express the hope that  in the present volume he has made at least a slight contribution  toward discharging the common debt of the Jewish nation-that it  is not utterly unworthy of him whose name it bears.    This volume, however, is not a product of circumstances; it was  not written on the occasion of the centenary celebration.  It was  designed to form one of the series of the biographies of Jewish  Worthies planned by the JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY OF AMERICA,  the first issue of which was devoted to Maimonides.  The  biography of Rashi is the second of the series.  It is not for the  author to endorse the order adopted, but he hazards the opinion  that the readers will find the portrait of Rashi no unfitting  companion-piece even to that of the author of the <I>Moreh.</I>    Jewish history may include minds more brilliant and works more  original than Rashi's.  But it is incontestable that he is one of  those historical personages who afford a double interest; his own  personality is striking and at the same time he is the  representative of a civilization and of a period.  He has this  double interest for us to an eminent degree.  His physiognomy has  well-marked, individual features, and yet he is the best exponent  of French Judaism in the middle ages.  He is somebody, and he  represents something.  Through this double claim, he forms an  integral part of Jewish history and literature.  There are great  men who despite their distinguished attributes stand apart from  the general intellectual movements.  They can be estimated  without reference to an historical background.  Rashi forms, so to  say, an organic part of Jewish history.  A whole department of  Jewish literature would be enigmatical without him.  Like a star  which leaves a track of light in its passage across the skies,  Rashi aroused the enthusiasm of his contemporaries, but no less  was he admired and venerated by posterity, and to-day, after the  lapse of eight centuries, he is, as the poet says, \"still young  in glory and immortality.\"    His name is most prominently connected with Rabbinical  literature.  Whether large questions are dealt with, or the  minutest details are considered, it is always Rashi who is  referred to-he has a share in all its destinies, and he seems  inseparable from it forever.    It is this circumstance that makes the writing of his biography  as awkward a task for the writer as reading it may be for the  public.  To write it one must be a scholar, to read it a  specialist.  To know Rashi well is as difficult as it is  necessary.  Singularly enough, popular as he was, he was  essentially a Talmudist, and at no time have connoisseurs of the  Talmud formed a majority.  This is the reason why historians like  Graetz, though they dilate upon the unparalleled qualities of  Rashi's genius, can devote only a disproportionately small number  of pages to him and his works.    Though the writer has throughout been aware of the difficulties  inherent in his task, yet he is also conscious that he has  sometimes succeeded in removing them only by eluding them.  In  parts, when the matter to be treated was unyielding, it became  necessary to dwell on side issues, or fill up gaps and replace  obscurities by legends and hypotheses.  The object in view being  a book popular in character and accessible to all, technical  discussions had to be eschewed.  Many knotty points had to be  brushed aside lightly, and the most debatable points passed over  in silence.  These are the sacrifices to which one must resign  himself, though it requires self-restraint to do it consistently.  The reader may, therefore, not expect to find new data in these  pages, new facts and texts not published before.  If the book has  any merit, it is that it presents the actual state of knowledge  on the subject, and the author anticipates the charge of  plagiarism by disclaiming any intention of producing an original  work.  Recondite sources have not always been referred to, in  order not to overload a text which at best is apt to tax the  reader's powers of attention.  Such references and special remarks  as were deemed necessary have been incorporated either in Notes  placed at the end of the book, or in an Appendix containing a  bibliography.  There the works are mentioned to which the author  is chiefly indebted, and which his readers may profitably consult  if they desire to pursue the subject further.    The author"]]]
