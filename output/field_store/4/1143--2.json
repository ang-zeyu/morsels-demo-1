CHAPTER I    THE QUESTION STATED      The first thought that men had concerning the heavenly bodies was an  obvious one: they were lights. There was a greater light to rule the day;  a lesser light to rule the night; and there were the stars also.    In those days there seemed an immense difference between the earth upon  which men stood, and the bright objects that shone down upon it from the  heavens above. The earth seemed to be vast, dark, and motionless; the  celestial lights seemed to be small, and moved, and shone. The earth was  then regarded as the fixed centre of the universe, but the Copernican  theory has since deprived it of this pride of place. Yet from another  point of view the new conception of its position involves a promotion,  since the earth itself is now regarded as a heavenly body of the same  order as some of those which shine down upon us. It is amongst them, and  it too moves and shines--shines, as some of them do, by reflecting the  light of the sun. Could we transport ourselves to a neighbouring world,  the earth would seem a star, not distinguishable in kind from the rest.    But as men realized this, they began to ask: \"Since this world from a  distant standpoint must appear as a star, would not a star, if we could  get near enough to it, show itself also as a world? This world teems with  life; above all, it is the home of human life. Men and women, gifted with  feeling, intelligence, and character, look upward from its surface and  watch the shining members of the heavenly host. Are none of these the home  of beings gifted with like powers, who watch in their turn the movements  of that shining point which is our world?\"    This is the meaning of the controversy on the Plurality of Worlds which  excited so much interest some sixty years ago, and has been with us more  or less ever since. It is the desire to recognize the presence in the orbs  around us of beings like ourselves, possessed of personality and  intelligence, lodged in an organic body.    This is what is meant when we speak of a world being \"inhabited.\" It would  not, for example, at all content us if we could ascertain that Jupiter was  covered by a shoreless ocean, rich in every variety of fish; or that the  hard rocks of the Moon were delicately veiled by lichens. Just as no  richness of vegetation and no fulness and complexity of animal life would  justify an explorer in describing some land that he had discovered as  being \"inhabited\" if no men were there, so we cannot rightly speak of any  other world as being \"inhabited\" if it is not the home of intelligent  life. If the life did not rise above the level of algae or oysters, the  globe on which they flourish would be uninhabited in our estimation, and  its chief interest would lie in the possibility that in the course of ages  life might change its forms and develop hereafter into manifestations with  which we could claim a nearer kinship.    On the other hand, of necessity we are precluded from extending our  enquiry to the case of disembodied intelligences, if such be conceived  possible. All created existences must be conditioned, but if we have no  knowledge of what those conditions may be, or means for attaining such  knowledge, we cannot discuss them. Nothing can be affirmed, nothing  denied, concerning the possibility of intelligences existing on the Moon  or even in the Sun if we are unable to ascertain under what limitations  those particular intelligences subsist. Gnomes, sylphs, elves, and  fairies, and all similar conceptions, escape the possibility of discussion  by our ignorance of their properties. As nothing can be asserted of them  they remain beyond investigation, as they are beyond sight and touch.    The only beings, then, the presence of which would justify us in regarding  another world as \"inhabited\" are such as would justify us in applying that  term to a part of our own world. They must possess intelligence and  consciousness on the one hand; on the other, they must likewise have  corporeal form. True, the form might be imagined as different from that we  possess; but, as with ourselves, the intelligent spirit must be lodged in  and expressed by a living material body. Our enquiry is thus rendered a  physical one; it is the necessities of the living body that must guide us  in it; a world unsuited for living organisms is not, in the sense of this  enquiry, a \"habitable\" world.    The discussion, as it was carried on sixty years ago by Dr. Whewell and  Sir David Brewster, was essentially a metaphysical, almost a theological  one, and it was chiefly considered in its supposed relationship to certain  religious conceptions. It was urged that it was derogatory to the wisdom  and goodness of the Creator to suppose that He would have created so many  great and glorious orbs without having a definite purpose in so doing, and  that the only purpose for which a world could be made was that it might be  inhabited. So, again, when Dr. A. R. Wallace revived the discussion in  1903, he clearly had a theological purpose in his opening paper, though he  was taking the opposite view from that held by Brewster half a century  earlier.    For myself, if there be any theological significance attaching to the  solving of this problem, I do not know what it is. If we decide that there  are very many inhabited worlds, or that there are few, or that there is  but one--our own--I fail to see how it should modify our religious  beliefs. For example: explorers have made their way across the Antarctic  continent to the South Pole but have found no \"inhabitant\" there. Has this  fact any theological bearing? or if, on the contrary, a race of men had  been discovered there, what change would it have made in the theological  position of anyone? And if this be so with regard to a new continent on  this earth, why should it be different with regard to the continents of  another planet?    The problem therefore seems not to be theological or metaphysical, but  purely physical. We have simply to ask with regard to each heavenly body  which we pass in review: \"Are its physical conditions, so far as we can  ascertain them, such as would render the maintenance of life possible upon  it?\" The question is not at all as to how life is generated on a world,  but as to whether, if once in action on a particular world, its activities  could be carried on.          CHAPTER II    THE LIVING ORGANISM      A world for habitation, then, is a world whereon living organisms can  exist that are comparable in intelligence with men. But \"men\" presuppose  the existence of living organisms of inferior grades. Therefore a world  for habitation must first of all be one upon which it is possible for  living organisms, as such, to exist.    It does not concern us in the present connection how life first came into  existence on this planet. It is sufficient that we know from experience  that life does exist here; and in whatsoever way it was first generated  here, in that same way we may consider that it could have been generated  on another planet.    Nor need any question trouble us as to the precise line of demarkation to  be drawn between inorganic and organic substances, or amongst the latter,  between plants and animals. These are important subjects for discussion,  but they do not affect us here, for we are essentially concerned with the  highest form of organism, the one furthest from these two dividing lines.    It suffices that living organisms do exist here, and exist under  well-defined conditions. Wanting these conditions, they perish. We can, to  a varying degree, determine the physical conditions prevailing upon the  heavenly bodies, and we can ascertain whether these physical conditions  would be favourable, unfavourable, or fatal to the living organism.    What is a living organism? A living organism is such that, though it is  continually changing its substance, its identity, as a whole, remains  essentially the same. This definition is incomplete, but it gives us a  first essential approximation, it indicates the continuance of the whole,  with the unceasing change of the details. Were this definition complete, a  river would furnish us with a perfect example of a living organism,  because, while the river remains, the individual drops of water are  continually changing. There is then something more in the living organism  than the continuity of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35993"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote de la Mancha (#1)"],[1,"note: The single occurence in the original of the letter e  with macron above has been represented in the text below as [=e]          THE HISTORY    OF    DON QUIXOTE DE LA MANCHA.
