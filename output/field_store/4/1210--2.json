INTRODUCTION.      When the author of this book has been absorbed in the elegant narratives  of Washington Irving, reading and musing over _Astoria_ and  _Bonneville_, in the cozy quiet of a New York study, no prescient motion  of the mind ever gave prophetic indication of that personal acquaintance  which has since been formed with the scenes, and even with some of the  characters which figure in the works just referred to. Yet so have  events shaped themselves that to me Astoria is familiar ground; Forts  Vancouver and Walla-Walla pictured forever in my memory; while such  journeys as I have been enabled to make into the country east of the  last named fort, have given me a fair insight into the characteristic  features of its mountains and its plains.    To-day, a railroad traverses the level stretch between the Missouri  River and the Rocky Mountains, along which, thirty years ago, the  fur-traders had worn a trail by their annual excursions with men,  pack-horses, and sometimes wagons, destined to the Rocky Mountains.  Then, they had to guard against the attacks of the Savages; and in this  respect civilization is behind the railroad, for now, as then, it is not  safe to travel without a sufficient escort. To-day, also, we have new  Territories called by several names cut out of the identical  hunting-grounds of the fur-traders of thirty years ago; and steamboats  plying the rivers where the mountain-men came to set their traps for  beaver; or cities growing up like mushrooms from a soil made quick by  gold, where the hardy mountain-hunter pursued the buffalo herds in  search of his winter's supply of food.    The wonderful romance which once gave enchantment to stories of hardship  and of daring deeds, suffered and done in these then distant wilds, is  fast being dissipated by the rapid settlement of the new Territories,  and by the familiarity of the public mind with tales of stirring  adventure encountered in the search for glittering ores. It was, then,  not without an emotion of pleased surprise that I first encountered in  the fertile plains of Western Oregon the subject of this biography, a  man fifty-eight years of age, of fine appearance and buoyant temper,  full of anecdote, and with a memory well stored with personal  recollections of all the men of note who have formerly visited the old  Oregon Territory, when it comprised the whole country west of the Rocky  Mountains lying north of California and south of the forty-ninth  parallel. This man is _Joseph L. Meek_, to whose stories of  mountain-life I have listened for days together; and who, after having  figured conspicuously, and not without considerable fame, in the early  history of Oregon, still prides himself most of all on having been a  \"mountain-man.\"    It has frequently been suggested to Mr. Meek, who has now come to be  known by the familiar title of \"Uncle Joe\" to all Oregon, that a history  of his varied adventures would make a readable book, and some of his  neighbors have even undertaken to become his historian, yet with so  little well-directed efforts that the task after all has fallen to a  comparative stranger. I confess to having taken hold of it with some  doubts as to my claims to the office; and the best recommendation I can  give my work is the interest I myself felt in the subject of it; and the  only apology I can offer for anything incredible in the narrative which  it may contain, is that I \"tell the tale as 'twas told to me,\" and that  I have no occasion to doubt the truth of it.    Seeing that the incidents I had to record embraced a period of a score  and a half of years, and that they extended over those years most  interesting in Oregon history, as well as of the history of the Fur  Trade in the West, I have concluded to preface Mr. Meek's adventures  with a sketch of the latter, believing that the information thus  conveyed to the reader will give an additional degree of interest to  their narration. The impression made upon my own mind as I gained a  knowledge of the facts which I shall record in this book relating to the  early occupation of Oregon, was that they were not only profoundly  romantic, but decidedly unique.    Mr. Meek was born in Washington Co., Virginia, in 1810, one year before  the settlement of _Astoria_, and at a period when Congress was much  interested in the question of our Western possessions and their  boundary. \"Manifest destiny\" seemed to have raised him up, together with  many others, bold, hardy, and fearless men, to become sentinels on the  outposts of civilization, securing to the United States with comparative  ease a vast extent of territory, for which, without them, a long  struggle with England would have taken place, delaying the settlement of  the Pacific Coast for many years, if not losing it to us altogether. It  is not without a feeling of genuine self-congratulation, that I am able  to bear testimony to the services, hitherto hardly recognized, of the  \"mountain-men\" who have settled in Oregon. Whenever there shall arise a  studious and faithful historian, their names shall not be excluded from  honorable mention, nor least illustrious will appear that of Joseph L.  Meek, the Rocky Mountain Hunter and Trapper.          CONTENTS.      PREFATORY CHAPTER.

In commencing a work of this nature, we have had two principal objects in  view: the diffusion of original observations, which, while they might  further the ends of science, would also be interesting to the general  reader; and that of discouraging the publication of distorted figures  copied from old authors, by accustoming the public eye to original designs  and correct representations of natural objects. How far we may have  succeeded in this latter object, remains to be judged by others; we are  however satisfied with having made the attempt, and we hope that abler  pencils than our own, may engage in the prosecution of this most desirable  object; for it is only by the publication of original matter, that a check  can be given to the increasing number of compilations and multiplied copies  of \"ill-shaped\" figures, by which error is perpetuated, and science  retarded.    The only original work that has appeared in this country similar to our  own, is the Zoological Miscellany by Dr. Leach, which, as it was  discontinued after the third volume, it may be presumed was unsuccessful:  although little can be said of many of the figures in the early volumes,  those in the latter are much to be praised, and the whole are original; the  descriptions also abound with details highly interesting to the scientific  world, for which indeed the learned author principally intended it;  nevertheless it is a question, whether science in the end would not have  been equally, and perhaps more advanced, had this work been more adapted to  general readers. Instruction in these days of refinement must be made easy,  palatable, and enticing; the eye must be pleased, while the understanding  is improved, and Wisdom in her simple dignified garb will often be deserted  for Ignorance, decked out in the glittering trappings of Folly.    The _Naturalist's Miscellany_ conducted by Dr. Shaw, in its miscellaneous  nature also resembled the present work, and reached to the extent of  twenty-four volumes. What an invaluable fund of information these might  have contained had their contents been original! Unfortunately, however,  the exceptions are so few, that the whole may be termed a loose  compilation, the descriptions being mostly given in as few words as  possible, and the figures not only copied from wretched representations  found in old authors, but often coloured from their descriptions only! It  is indeed lamentable that the Author, whose talents and abilities were  unquestionable, should have exerted them so little, and thus have descended  to the rank of a voluminous compiler, for little better can be said of the  General Zoology, begun and continued under his name: little original matter  can there be found, excepting in the latter volumes, yet even in these no  notice whatever is taken of the immense number of new species discovered in  Africa by Le Vaillant, and long ago published in the _Oiseaux d'Afrique_:  the engravings also are in like manner copied from old prints, enlarged or  diminished as occasion offers, without even a regard to the selection of  the best. It may be as well to observe in this place, that a great number  of generic distinctions have been made in the two last volumes; which, as  they have not been followed by any of the great and acknowledged Zoologists  on the Continent, and appear to us in many instances trivial and  unnecessary, will not be adopted in this work.    It will be unnecessary to point out with regard to the scientific  arrangement, that we have avowedly adopted the principles of the modern  classification; which the strict followers of Linnaeus (in this country  alone) have so long, but so ineffectually opposed. The first has been  designated as the natural, and the other the artificial system; and,  without entering into a critical disquisition on these definitions, it will  be sufficient to observe, that by the Artificial System we bend nature to  conform to certain arbitrary principles, which we lay down and to which we  insist all her productions known and unknown will conform; while in the  Natural method, we endeavour by tracing her modifications, to adapt our  system to that which appears to regulate her operations. In the one we give  laws, in the other receive them; by the first we are taught to believe that  the highest attainment of the science, is that of ascertaining the name of  an object in our Museum, or of giving a new one; we record it in our  favourite system as a grammarian enters a new word in his dictionary, and  there the matter terminates. Where the artificial system ends, the natural  begins; for we then proceed to the investigation of affinities founded on  anatomical construction, economy, and geographic distribution; our  attention ceases to be confined to individuals, and extends to large  groups; general facts enable us to draw general conclusions, till the mind  begins faintly to discern a vast and mighty plan, by which the zones of the  earth are peopled by their own respective races of animate beings; blending  their confines unto each other with divine harmony, beauty, and usefulness.    That these inquiries and results have had a most wonderful effect on the  natural sciences of late years, is abundantly evident. Geology, a subject  hardly thought of in this country a few years ago, is now found to be a  science of the first importance; with this, however, Conchology is so  intimately connected, that without a certain knowledge of it, the geologist  is frequently unable to prosecute inquiries of the most interesting nature;  and there is little doubt but that Botany has been raised to the rank it  now so justly holds, solely because its natural system has been more  generally studied and advocated in this country, than that of any other  branch of Natural History. In this science at least, we possess a  superiority which our continental neighbours cannot dispute; and the name  of Brown will be enrolled in the brightest page of our philosophic  inquirers.    That the prejudiced adherence to the strict Linnaean system, has been the  primary cause why Zoology has been more neglected with us than on the  Continent, will admit of little doubt; for by shutting the door to all  further improvement, it has impressed the generality of our countrymen with  an idea, that the highest object of the Naturalist was to label the  contents of a museum, and to arrange stuffed animals, like quaint patterns  of old china, in glass cases: to thinking minds no less than to the vulgar,  this idea has produced a feeling of contempt and ridicule, and very few of  those qualified by nature for accurate investigation and philosophic  reasoning, have been induced to make the science a study; and thus from  such an unfortunate prejudice, to use the words of a powerful writer of the  present day, \"some future historian of the progress of human knowledge,  will have to state that England, till within the few last years, stood  still at the bottom of the steps where Linnaeus had left her; while her  neighbours were advancing rapidly towards the entrance of the temple[1].\"    Finally--Linnaeus to a comprehensive genius united indefatigable industry;  yet he could not see and study those innumerable productions that have been  discovered since his death: in proportion as our knowledge of objects  increases, so must our systems change, until the natural one is fully  developed; and the question simply comes to this, Whether the Linnaean  method should be upheld as a solitary exception to the mutability of human  wisdom.    The sun of truth must however finally prevail, and there is every reason to  think it has already broke, and will gradually disperse these mists of  prejudice. It is however much to be regretted, that our public institutions  are wholly inadequate to facilitate not only the advancement of students,  but the researches of those who are already engaged in prosecuting their  inquiries: in Scotland alone are founded any Professorships of Natural  History, and the establishment of our National Museum (in this branch only)  is confessedly difficult: materials for study are more necessary in this  science than any other; yet the public Institutions and libraries of the  metropolis, \"rich and rare\" in every other department of knowledge, in most  instances are deficient in this of the most elementary books; setting aside  those of illustration, which, from being unavoidably expensive and within  the reach of few purchasers, are more particularly adapted for such general"]]]
