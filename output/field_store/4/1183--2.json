C. FOWLER,    PRINTER,    MOORFIELDS, LONDON.          [Illustration: Tiger Hunting]    PREFACE.      Illustrations are like windows to the house of knowledge. They let light  in upon the understanding, and they facilitate the outlook upon truth  and beauty. To illustrate is to help one sense by the use of another, to  reason by analogy, and to teach the unknown by the known. When  definition fails, illustration often carries conviction, and the most  successful teachers are those who make the best use of sound and telling  illustrations. How many lessons would have been wholly forgotten by us,  but for the illustrations which made their meanings clear, and left  their truths for ever in our minds?    The book of nature is full of illustrations which help the understanding  of the book of life, and no illustrations are more valuable and  fascinating, whether as revelations of the order and habits of Nature  herself, or as parallels and parables, full of suggestive application to  the social and moral life of humanity, than those afforded by the study  of Natural History.    To gather into a convenient volume Illustrative Anecdotes of Natural  History, which shall throw light upon the study of Animal Life, for  those pursuing it for its own sake, and help to the understanding of  Nature herself is the primary object of this work, while it is hoped  that it may serve a secondary purpose of no small utility, in  suggesting social and moral parallels.    With a view to its first purpose the illustrations are classified in  order as those of Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fishes, etc., etc., and as  much knowledge of Natural History as can be conveyed in anecdote form  has been attempted. The book will thus, it is hoped, be a valuable aid  to the teacher of Natural History, as a manual of illustrations for his  lessons, as well as full of interest to the general reader, who may not  wish to devote the time necessary to more exhaustive scientific study.

HYDE GOES TO HIS OWN PLACE AND SUSAN TAKES A HONEYMOON      XXXV  \"RILLA-MY-RILLA!\"        CHAPTER I    GLEN \"NOTES\" AND OTHER MATTERS    It was a warm, golden-cloudy, lovable afternoon. In the big living-room  at Ingleside Susan Baker sat down with a certain grim satisfaction  hovering about her like an aura; it was four o'clock and Susan, who had  been working incessantly since six that morning, felt that she had  fairly earned an hour of repose and gossip. Susan just then was  perfectly happy; everything had gone almost uncannily well in the  kitchen that day. Dr. Jekyll had not been Mr. Hyde and so had not  grated on her nerves; from where she sat she could see the pride of her  heart--the bed of peonies of her own planting and culture, blooming as  no other peony plot in Glen St. Mary ever did or could bloom, with  peonies crimson, peonies silvery pink, peonies white as drifts of  winter snow.    Susan had on a new black silk blouse, quite as elaborate as anything  Mrs. Marshall Elliott ever wore, and a white starched apron, trimmed  with complicated crocheted lace fully five inches wide, not to mention  insertion to match. Therefore Susan had all the comfortable  consciousness of a well-dressed woman as she opened her copy of the  Daily Enterprise and prepared to read the Glen \"Notes\" which, as Miss  Cornelia had just informed her, filled half a column of it and  mentioned almost everybody at Ingleside. There was a big, black  headline on the front page of the Enterprise, stating that some  Archduke Ferdinand or other had been assassinated at a place bearing  the weird name of Sarajevo, but Susan tarried not over uninteresting,  immaterial stuff like that; she was in quest of something really vital.  Oh, here it was--\"Jottings from Glen St. Mary.\" Susan settled down  keenly, reading each one over aloud to extract all possible  gratification from it.    Mrs. Blythe and her visitor, Miss Cornelia--alias Mrs. Marshall  Elliott--were chatting together near the open door that led to the  veranda, through which a cool, delicious breeze was blowing, bringing  whiffs of phantom perfume from the garden, and charming gay echoes from  the vine-hung corner where Rilla and Miss Oliver and Walter were  laughing and talking. Wherever Rilla Blythe was, there was laughter.    There was another occupant of the living-room, curled up on a couch,  who must not be overlooked, since he was a creature of marked  individuality, and, moreover, had the distinction of being the only  living thing whom Susan really hated.    All cats are mysterious but Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde--\"Doc\" for  short--was trebly so. He was a cat of double personality--or else, as  Susan vowed, he was possessed by the devil. To begin with, there had  been something uncanny about the very dawn of his existence. Four years  previously Rilla Blythe had had a treasured darling of a kitten, white  as snow, with a saucy black tip to its tail, which she called Jack  Frost. Susan disliked Jack Frost, though she could not or would not  give any valid reason therefor.    \"Take my word for it, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" she was wont to say ominously,  \"that cat will come to no good.\"    \"But why do you think so?\" Mrs. Blythe would ask.    \"I do not think--I know,\" was all the answer Susan would vouchsafe.    With the rest of the Ingleside folk Jack Frost was a favourite; he was  so very clean and well groomed, and never allowed a spot or stain to be  seen on his beautiful white suit; he had endearing ways of purring and  snuggling; he was scrupulously honest.    And then a domestic tragedy took place at Ingleside. Jack Frost had  kittens!    It would be vain to try to picture Susan's triumph. Had she not always  insisted that that cat would turn out to be a delusion and a snare? Now  they could see for themselves!    Rilla kept one of the kittens, a very pretty one, with peculiarly sleek  glossy fur of a dark yellow crossed by orange stripes, and large,  satiny, golden ears. She called it Goldie and the name seemed  appropriate enough to the little frolicsome creature which, during its  kittenhood, gave no indication of the sinister nature it really  possessed. Susan, of course, warned the family that no good could be  expected from any offspring of that diabolical Jack Frost; but Susan's  Cassandra-like croakings were unheeded.    The Blythes had been so accustomed to regard Jack Frost as a member of  the male sex that they could not get out of the habit. So they  continually used the masculine pronoun, although the result was  ludicrous. Visitors used to be quite electrified when Rilla referred  casually to \"Jack and his kitten,\" or told Goldie sternly, \"Go to your  mother and get him to wash your fur.\"    \"It is not decent, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" poor Susan would say bitterly. She  herself compromised by always referring to Jack as \"it\" or \"the white  beast,\" and one heart at least did not ache when \"it\" was accidentally  poisoned the following winter.    In a year's time \"Goldie\" became so manifestly an inadequate name for  the orange kitten that Walter, who was just then reading Stevenson's  story, changed it to Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde. In his Dr. Jekyll mood  the cat was a drowsy, affectionate, domestic, cushion-loving puss, who  liked petting and gloried in being nursed and patted. Especially did he  love to lie on his back and have his sleek, cream-coloured throat  stroked gently while he purred in somnolent satisfaction. He was a  notable purrer; never had there been an Ingleside cat who purred so  constantly and so ecstatically.    \"The only thing I envy a cat is its purr,\" remarked Dr. Blythe once,  listening to Doc's resonant melody. \"It is the most contented sound in  the world.\"    Doc was very handsome; his every movement was grace; his poses  magnificent. When he folded his long, dusky-ringed tail about his feet  and sat him down on the veranda to gaze steadily into space for long  intervals the Blythes felt that an Egyptian sphinx could not have made  a more fitting Deity of the Portal.    When the Mr. Hyde mood came upon him--which it invariably did before  rain, or wind--he was a wild thing with changed eyes. The  transformation always came suddenly. He would spring fiercely from a  reverie with a savage snarl and bite at any restraining or caressing  hand. His fur seemed to grow darker and his eyes gleamed with a  diabolical light. There was really an unearthly beauty about him. If  the change happened in the twilight all the Ingleside folk felt a  certain terror of him. At such times he was a fearsome beast and only  Rilla defended him, asserting that he was \"such a nice prowly cat.\"  Certainly he prowled.    Dr. Jekyll loved new milk; Mr. Hyde would not touch milk and growled  over his meat. Dr. Jekyll came down the stairs so silently that no one  could hear him. Mr. Hyde made his tread as heavy as a man's. Several  evenings, when Susan was alone in the house, he \"scared her stiff,\" as  she declared, by doing this. He would sit in the middle of the kitchen  floor, with his terrible eyes fixed unwinkingly upon hers for an hour  at a time. This played havoc with her nerves, but poor Susan really  held him in too much awe to try to drive him out. Once she had dared to  throw a stick at him and he had promptly made a savage leap towards  her. Susan rushed out of doors and never attempted to meddle with Mr.  Hyde again--though she visited his misdeeds upon the innocent Dr.  Jekyll, chasing him ignominiously out of her domain whenever he dared  to poke his nose in and denying him certain savoury tidbits for which  he yearned.    \"'The many friends of Miss Faith Meredith, Gerald Meredith and James  Blythe,'\" read Susan, rolling the names like sweet morsels under her  tongue, \"'were very much pleased to welcome them home a few weeks ago  from Redmond College. James Blythe, who was graduated in Arts in 1913,  had just completed his first year in medicine.'\"    \"Faith Meredith has really got to be the most handsomest creature I  ever saw,\" commented Miss Cornelia above her filet crochet. \"It's  amazing how those children came on after Rosemary West went to the  manse. People have almost forgotten what imps of mischief they were  once. Anne, dearie, will you ever forget the way they used to carry on?  It's really surprising how well Rosemary got on with them. She's more  like a chum than a step-mother. They all love her and Una adores her.  As for that little Bruce, Una just makes a perfect slave of herself to  him. Of course, he is a darling. But did you ever see any child look as  much like an aunt as he looks like his Aunt Ellen? He's just as dark  and just as emphatic. I can't see a feature of Rosemary in him. Norman  Douglas always vows at the top of his voice that the stork meant Bruce  for him and Ellen and took him to the manse by"]]]
