We were actuated by no desire to make a \"record\" in bicycle travel,  although we covered 15,044 miles on the wheel, the longest continuous land  journey ever made around the world.    The day after we were graduated at Washington University, St. Louis, Mo.,  we left for New York. Thence we sailed for Liverpool on June 23, 1890.  Just three years afterward, lacking twenty days, we rolled into New York  on our wheels, having \"put a girdle round the earth.\"    Our bicycling experience began at Liverpool. After following many of the  beaten lines of travel in the British Isles we arrived in London, where we  formed our plans for traveling across Europe, Asia, and America. The most  dangerous regions to be traversed in such a journey, we were told, were  western China, the Desert of Gobi, and central China. Never since the days  of Marco Polo had a European traveler succeeded in crossing the Chinese  empire from the west to Peking.    Crossing the Channel, we rode through Normandy to Paris, across the  lowlands of western France to Bordeaux, eastward over the Lesser Alps to  Marseilles, and along the Riviera into Italy. After visiting every  important city on the peninsula, we left Italy at Brindisi on the last day  of 1890 for Corfu, in Greece. Thence we traveled to Patras, proceeding  along the Corinthian Gulf to Athens, where we passed the winter. We went  to Constantinople by vessel in the spring, crossed the Bosporus in April,  and began the long journey described in the following pages. When we had  finally completed our travels in the Flowery Kingdom, we sailed from  Shanghai for Japan. Thence we voyaged to San Francisco, where we arrived  on Christmas night, 1892. Three weeks later we resumed our bicycles and  wheeled by way of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas to New York.    During all of this journey we never employed the services of guides or  interpreters. We were compelled, therefore, to learn a little of the  language of every country through which we passed. Our independence in  this regard increased, perhaps, the hardships of the journey, but  certainly contributed much toward the object we sought--a close  acquaintance with strange peoples.    During our travels we took more than two thousand five hundred  photographs, selections from which are reproduced in the illustrations of  this volume.

RUSSELL      In the course of my taxonomic study of the genus _Cratogeomys_, a high  degree of variation was found between several populations of these  gophers in central Jalisco. Two species, _C. gymnurus_ and _C.  zinseri_, occur in this part of the state. Previously _C. gymnurus_ was  known only from southern Jalisco and _C. zinseri_ only from extreme  eastern Jalisco, but through the efforts of J. R. Alcorn specimens were  obtained of both species in the central part of the state. These large  gophers are difficult to collect, and I am grateful to him for securing  this significant material. Costs of the field work were defrayed by the  National Science Foundation and the Kansas University Endowment  Association. Thanks are due also to those in charge of the United  States Biological Surveys Collection for the loan of comparative  material. Study of the recently acquired specimens taken in central  Jalisco reveals two undescribed subspecies each of _C. gymnurus_ and  _C. zinseri_. These may be known and described as      =Cratogeomys gymnurus tellus= new subspecies         _Type._--Female, adult, skull and skin, No. 33454 Mus. Nat.       Hist., Univ. Kansas; from 3 mi. W Tala, 4300 ft., Jalisco,       Mexico; obtained on June 2, 1949, by J. R. Alcorn, original       No. 9376.         _Range._--North-central Jalisco; known from several       localities in the vicinity of Tala.         _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); tail long,       naked; hind foot small; color pale for species, upper parts       Kaiser Brown (capitalized terms are of Ridgway, Color       Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912),       bases of individual hairs Plumbeous, tips Hazel, underparts       creamy-white, bases of hairs Plumbeous; skull large,       relatively narrow, rugose; zygomatic breadth narrower       posteriorly than anteriorly; rostrum shallow, relatively       broad in males, narrower in females; interorbital region       broad; braincase narrow and flattened; basioccipital       relatively wide, especially anteriorly; mastoid processes of       squamosal large, knoblike; paroccipital processes long,       extending laterally over more than half the width of mastoid       bullae; upper incisors projecting anteriorly; maxillary       teeth relatively large.         _Comparisons._--From topotypes of _C. g. gymnurus_ from       Zapotlan, Jalisco, the most closely related subspecies, _C.       g. tellus_ differs in: Body smaller (total length averaging       338 instead of 341 in females and 356 instead of 369 in       males); hind foot smaller (averaging 45 instead of 50 in       females and 47 instead of 51 in males); color more brownish       above, creamy-white rather than buffy below; skull smaller,       especially in females (basilar length averaging 55.3 instead       of 57.5 in females and 57.7 instead of 60.5 in males),       narrower, and more rugose; zygomatic breadth less in females       (averaging 42.5 compared with 46.2), greater in males (48.0       compared with 46.7); zygomata more nearly parallel; auditory       bullae relatively smaller; mastoid processes of squamosal       larger, knoblike; paroccipital processes longer, extending       farther laterally; rostrum less massive; upper incisors       projecting anteriorly, instead of being strongly recurved;       maxillary teeth relatively larger.         From near-topotypes of _C. g. inclarus_ from the Sierra       Nevada de Colima, Jalisco, _C. g. tellus_ differs in: Hind       foot smaller; color paler brownish above in contrast to       glossy black, creamy-white below rather than buffy, feet       clothed with whitish instead of brownish hairs; skull larger       (basilar length averaging 55.3 in females compared with       53.2, no males available for comparisons); zygomatic breadth       less; nasals longer, extending posterior to front edge of       anterior roots of zygomata rather than ending even with, or       slightly behind, them; rostrum more massive; mastoid       processes of squamosal larger; paroccipital processes       extending farther laterally; upper incisors projecting       anteriorly, rather than recurved; maxillary teeth larger       (length of maxillary tooth-row averaging 14.6 compared with       13.3).         Close comparison with _C. g. imparilis_ from Patzcuaro,       Michoacan, is not needed, _but C. g. tellus_ differs       especially in: Color of underparts and hairs of feet whitish       rather than brownish; skull smaller; zygomatic breadth       greater; interorbital constriction broader; nasals longer;       maxillary tooth-row longer.         _Measurements._--Averages of three adult females, including       type, and the measurements of an adult male (in parentheses)       from the type locality are: Total length, 338 (356); length       of tail, 92 (87); length of hind foot, 45 (47);       occipitonasal length of skull, 64.1 (68.7); basilar length,       55.3 (61.4); zygomatic breadth, 42.7 (48.0); interorbital       breadth, 9.6 (11.4); greatest height of cranium, taken from       palate perpendicular to line touching two highest points on       top of skull, 23.9 (25.3); least depth of rostrum, 10.6       (11.7); breadth of rostrum, 14.7 (16.5); length of nasals,       23.6 (25.2); width across mastoid processes of squamosal,       43.8 (49.7); height of occiput, 18.1 (19.9); length of       maxillary tooth-row, 14.6 (15.2).         _Remarks._--The distribution of _C. gymnurus_ is spotty; its       occurrence seemingly depends on edaphic conditions. The       isolation of soils with textures suitable to this animal has       resulted in the isolation of gopher populations. The       distribution is similar to that of species occurring on       islands. In this instance, however, the populations of       gophers are separated by soils of heavy texture which render       burrowing difficult or impossible for gophers. Such       conditions have led to a high degree of subspeciation in a       relatively short distance. For example, four subspecies of       _C. gymnurus_ occur in Jalisco, and, all are within an area       scarcely fifty miles in diameter.         _Cratogeomys gymnurus tellus_ is the northernmost subspecies       of _C. gymnurus_. It is known from only the vicinity of       Tala, west of Guadalajara, and its range probably is not       much more extensive than this because of the localized       distribution of suitable soils.         _Specimens examined._--Total number ten, as follows: 3 mi. W       Tala, type locality, 5; 1 mi. NE Tala, 3; 1 mi. S El       Refugio, 2.      =Cratogeomys gymnurus atratus= new subspecies         _Type._--Female, adult, skull and skin, No. 31880 Mus. Nat.       Hist., Univ. Kansas; from Top of Cerro Viejo de Cuyutlan,       9700 ft., 19 mi. S and 9 mi. W Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico;       obtained on February 17, 1949, by J. R. Alcorn, original No.       7902.         _Range._--Known only from the type locality on the Cerro       Viejo.         _Diagnosis._--Size small (see measurements); tail long; hind       foot small; color dark, upper parts glossy Blackish Brown,       bases of hairs Plumbeous, sides Chestnut Brown, underparts       Pale Ochraceous-Buff or Warm Buff mixed with Plumbeous of       the hair bases; skull small, lightly constructed, relatively       deep; zygomata relatively weak; zygomatic breadth wider       posteriorly than anteriorly; rostrum relatively wide,       especially in males; nasals relatively long, truncate       posteriorly; interorbital constriction narrow; braincase       inflated; mastoid processes of squamosal only slightly wider       than zygomatic breadth; auditory bullae relatively large;       paroccipital processes weakly constructed, but extend       laterally over half the width of mastoid bullae; upper       incisors projecting anteriorly, rather than being strongly       recurved; maxillary teeth small.         _Comparisons._--From topotypes of _C. g. gymnurus_ from       Zapotlan, Jalisco, _C. g. atratus_ differs in: Body smaller       (total length averaging 300 in females compared with 341, a       male measured 315 compared with an average of 363); tail       shorter, hind foot smaller; color of upper parts darker,       glossy Blackish-Brown rather than reddish brown, underparts       paler; skull smaller (basilar length averaging 48.6 compared       with 57.5, a male measured 50.0 compared with an average of       59.0); zygomata more weakly constructed; zygomatic breadth       less, and wider posteriorly than anteriorly; braincase more       inflated; nasals shorter; rostrum relatively narrower and       shallower; width across mastoid processes of squamosals       less; paroccipital processes less strongly constructed,       extending farther laterally; upper incisors projecting       anteriorly rather than being strongly recurved; maxillary       teeth smaller (length of maxillary tooth-row averaging 11.2       compared with 14.9).         From _C. g. tellus_, that occurs to the northwest, _C. g.       atratus_ differs in: Body smaller; hind foot slightly       smaller; upper parts darker; underparts Pale Ochraceous-Buff "]]]
