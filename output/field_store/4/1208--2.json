Mammals that are strictly marine in habit are not included. The state  is crossed in its middle by the Tropic of Cancer. Elevations vary from  sea level on the Golfo de Mexico to more than 2700 meters in the Sierra  Madre Oriental; most of the state is below 300 meters in elevation. Its  area is 79,602 square kilometers (30,732 square miles).    Tamaulipas, meaning \"lugar en que hay montes altos\" (place of high  mountains), was explored in 1516 by the Spaniard Francisco Fernandez de  Cordoba, but it was not until the 18th century that Jose de Escandon  established several villages in the new province of Nueva Santender  from which, in the time of Iturbide's Empire, Tamaulipas was separated  as a distinct political entity, with about the same boundaries that it  now has.    My first contact with the state of Tamaulipas, as a mammalogist, was in  1957, when in company with Dr. Bernardo Villa R. I visited the Cueva  del Abra in the southern part of the state. On several occasions since  then I have been in the state, especially when employed by the  Direccion General de Caza of the Mexican Government. In 1960-1962 I had  the opportunity of studying the mammalian fauna of Tamaulipas at the  Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas. The  approximately 2000 specimens there represent many critical localities,  but are not sufficient to make this report as complete as could be  desired. Consequently the following account should be considered as a  contribution to the knowledge of the mammals of Mexico and is offered  in the hope that it will stimulate future studies of the Mexican fauna,  especially that of the eastern region.          PHYSIOGRAPHY      Tamaulipas can be divided into three physiographic regions, which from  east to west are Gulf Coastal Plain, Sierra Madre Oriental, and Central  Plateau or Mexican Plateau (Fig. 1).      Gulf Coastal Plain    This physiographic region covers most of the state and extends  northward into Texas and a short distance southward into Veracruz.    According to Tamayo (1949) and Vivo (1953), the Gulf Coastal Plain is  formed by sedimentary rocks from Mesozoic to"]]]
