He was a man mighty in war, and men held him in high honour.    Now one day to the court of Eric there came Bjarni the son of  Heriulf.  This Bjarni was a far traveler.  He had sailed many times  upon the seas, and when he came home he had ever some fresh tale  of marvel and adventure to tell.  But this time he had a tale to  tell more marvelous than any before.  For he told how far away across  the sea of Greenland, where no man had sailed before, he had found  a new, strange land.    But when the people asked news of this unknown land Bjarni could  tell them little, for he had not set foot upon those far shores.  Therefore the people scorned him.    \"Truly you have little hardihood,\" they said, \"else you had gone  ashore, and seen for yourself, and had given us good account of  this land.\"    But although Bjarni could tell nought of the new strange land, save  that he had seen it, the people thought much about it, and there  was great talk about voyages and discoveries, and many longed to  sail forth and find again the land which Bjarni the Traveler had  seen.  But more than any other in that kingdom, Leif the son of Eric  the Red, longed to find that land.  So Leif went to Eric and said:    \"Oh my father, I fain would seek the land which Bjarni the Traveler  has seen.  Give me gold that I may buy his ship and sail away upon  the seas to find it.\"    Then Eric the Red gave his son gold in great plenty. \"Go, my son,\"  he said, \"buy the ship of Bjarni the Traveler, and sail to the land  of which he tells.\"    Then Leif, quickly taking the gold, went to Bjarni and bought his  ship.    Leif was a tall man, of great strength and noble bearing.  He was  also a man of wisdom, and just in all things, so that men loved  and were ready to obey him.    Now therefore many men came to him offering to be his companions  in adventure, until soon they were a company of thirty-five men.  They were all men tall and of great strength, with fair golden hair  and eyes blue as the sea upon which they loved to sail, save only  Tyrker the German.    Long time this German had lived with Eric the Red and was much  beloved by him.  Tyrker also loved Leif dearly, for he had known  him since he was a child, and was indeed his foster father.  So he  was eager to go with Leif upon this adventurous voyage.  Tyrker was  very little and plain.  His forehead was high and his eyes small and  restless.  He wore shabby clothes, and to the blue-eyed, fair-haired  giants of the North he seemed indeed a sorry-looking little fellow.  But all that mattered little, for he was a clever craftsman, and  Leif and his companions were glad to have him go with them.    Then, all things being ready, Leif went to his father and, bending  his knee to him, prayed him to be their leader.    But Eric the Red shook his head. \"Nay, my son,\" he said, \" I am old  and stricken in years, and no more able to endure the hardships of  the sea.\"    \"Yet come, my father,\" pleaded Leif, \"for of a certainty if you  do, good luck will go with us.\"    Then Eric looked longingly at the sea.  His heart bade him go out  upon it once again ere he died.  So he yielded to the prayers of  his son and, mounting upon his horse, he rode towards the ship.    When the sea-farers saw him come they set up a shout of welcome.  But when Eric was not far from the ship the horse upon which he  was riding stumbled, and he was thrown to the ground.  He tried to  rise but could not, for his foot was sorely wounded.    Seeing that he cried out sadly, \"It is not for me to discover new  lands; go ye without me.\"    So Eric the Red returned to his home, and Leif went on his way to  his ship with his companions.    Now they busied themselves and set their dragon-headed vessel  in order.  And when all was ready they spread their gaily-coloured  sails, and sailed out into the unknown sea.    Westward and ever westward they sailed towards the setting of the  sun.  For many days they sailed yet they saw no land: nought was  about them but the restless, tossing waves.  But at length one day  to their watching eyes there appeared a faint grey line far on the  horizon.  Then their hearts bounded for joy.  They had not sailed in  vain, for land was near.    \"Surely,\" said Leif, as they drew close to it, \"this is the land  which Bjarni saw.  Let it not be said of us that we passed it by as  he did.\"    So, casting anchor, Leif and his companions launched a boat and  went ashore.  But it was no fair land to which they had come.  Far  inland great snow-covered mountains rose, and between them and the  sea lay flat and barren rock, where no grass or green thing grew.  It seemed to Leif and his companions that there was no good thing  in this land.    \"I will call it Helluland or Stone Land,\" said Leif.    Then he and his companions went back to the ship and put out to  sea once more.  They came to land again after some time, and again  they cast anchor and launched a boat and went ashore.  This land  was flat.

Notes on the Behavior of the Social Wasp Polistes    HORACE GUNTHORP    Washburn College, Topeka, Kans.      One day last September the writer picked up a nest of the common social  wasp, _Polistes_, which had been detached from its support, and placed  it upon his desk. A short time later he was attracted by a scratching  sound, and discovered that one of the wasps was just beginning to cut  the cap from its cell preparatory to emerging. During the next few days  a series of observations were made and notes taken covering the  behavior of the wasps which emerged from their cells during that  period. Miss Enteman[A] has made a careful study of the instincts of  the social wasps, and while the observations recorded in the present  paper are largely corroborative of her work, some interesting details  are here added.    The cutting of the cap of the cell occupied some time, and extended  around four-fifths of its circumference, the remaining one-fifth being  gnawed and partially chewed through so that it was flexible enough to  act as a hinge for the cap. After the cap was sufficiently cut away,  the wasp started to slowly work itself out, pushing up the top of the  cell like a trap door as progress was made. A good deal of effort was  required to get the body out until the front legs were freed. Then the  wasp had more purchase and progress was somewhat faster until the  second pair of legs came out. After this slight effort seemed to be  necessary for the completion of the operation.    For the next thirty minutes careful observations were made of the  movements of this wasp in order to ascertain its first reactions. It is  evident that they would be somewhat modified from what they are here  recorded if the colony had contained the queen and other workers, as  this specimen had the run of the entire nest, and none of its movements  were effected by those of other individuals. It is equally evident that  all stimuli came from within, or from contact with the nest, and not  from suggestions received from other individuals or from contact with  them. The following is the record made at one minute intervals,  beginning with the time the specimen left its cell:         8:06. Specimen emerged from its cell.         8:07. Cleaned its front legs in its mouth and its antennae             with its front legs.         8:08. Moved around some. Rubbed its wings with its hind legs             and spread them out twice.         8:09. Cleaned antennae and front legs.         8:10. Swung abdomen back and forth, and brushed its wings.             Moved around the nest rapidly and waved the antennae,             but all movements were jerky.         8:11. Explored nest, occasionally rubbing abdomen with legs.         8:12. Explored nest.         8:13. Explored nest. Movements unsteady. Cleaned antennae and             front legs.         8:14. Explored nest, in the course of which it went over the             edge on to the back side, but immediately returned to             the under side. Cleaned the front legs and antennae,             and then the hind legs.         8:15. Spread out the wings. Cleaned the antennae.         8:16. Cleaned abdomen.         8:17. Crawled on top or back side of nest again and stayed             there. Cleaned wings and abdomen.         8:18. Explored top. Cleaned front legs and antennae.         8:19. Stood still. Occasional movement of head, antennae or             abdomen.         8:20. Same as 8:19.         8:21. Began to explore again, becoming quite lively. Antennae             constantly waving.         8:22. Same as 8:21, but extended its travels to the under             (cell) side of the nest.         8:23. Left the nest entirely and began to walk around the             surface of the desk.         8:24. Started to climb a bottle that was some six inches             from the nest. Antennae still waving.         8:25. On the neck of the bottle, two inches above the             surface of the desk. Cleaned front legs and antennae.         8:26. Quiet except that it spread its wings once.         8:27. Still on neck of bottle. Moved its head and antennae             back and forth.         8:28. Slight change in position. Antennae were still waving.             Rubbed its wings, spread them, and then rubbed them             again.         8:29. Rubbed its hind legs together vigorously.         8:30. Spread wings once, then rubbed them and the abdomen             with the hind legs. Rubbed the hind legs together, and             finally rubbed the right wings vigorously.         8:31. Moved around some, occasionally stopping to rub the             right wings.         8:32. Explored the neck of the bottle.         8:33. Same as 8:32. Cleaned antennae.         8:34. Same as 8:33.         8:35. Stood still but continued to clean antennae and front             legs.         8:36. Climbed up and explored the cork of the bottle.         8:37-8:40. Stood still on the cork, occasionally moving its             jaws.    At 8:40 the nest was placed against the cork and the wasp immediately  crawled onto it, but seemed restless. As the nest has a faint, but  distinct, odor of honey, it was probably attracted to it through the  sense of smell.    The next morning the specimen was nowhere in sight, but forty-eight  hours later it fell out of a loose-leaf binder that had been lying on  the desk. It seemed to be as active as when seen two days before. Some  time during the second night after the appearance of the first  specimen, that is, when it was some thirty hours old, a second  individual emerged. This one was discovered on a pile of books two feet  from the nest where it had evidently crawled soon after emerging.    As soon as the first specimen was rediscovered, that is, when it was  sixty hours old, the second wasp then being thirty hours old, the two  were placed on the nest, and this in turn was placed on a book. They  both started on tours of observation, and every time they came in  contact with each other they made sudden starts and jumps to avoid an  evidently startling new object, meanwhile violently waving their  antennae and often cleaning these organs after such contact. Dr. Enteman  says, \"All wasps possess the instinct of fear. This ... is readily  overcome by the frequent appearance of the awe-inspiring object.\" This  is true, because they were evidently on familiar terms with each other  in half an hour, and paid very little attention to the frequent  meetings which before had apparently distressed them. They wandered  freely over their nest and the top surface of the book on which it was  placed, but did not attempt to climb off the latter.    At 12 o'clock, four hours later, a third wasp had appeared, and none of  the specimens seemed to be disturbed by the presence of the others.  When the nest was first picked up, one cell containing a well formed  pupa was uncapped. This specimen was then alive, but it may have been  dead at the time of this observation. In either case, it had been  dragged out of its cell, decapitated, and the front legs torn off. No  trace of the head was found, but the body and legs were on the"]]]
