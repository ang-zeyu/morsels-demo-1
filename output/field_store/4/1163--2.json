In presenting the second volume, a  number of sketches are included written by members who have hunted big  game in other lands. The contributions of those whose names are so well  known in connection with explorations in China and Tibet, and in Africa,  have an exceptional interest for men whose use of the rifle has been  confined entirely to the North American continent.    During the two years that have elapsed since the appearance of its last  volume, the Boone and Crockett Club has not been idle. The activity of  its members was largely instrumental in securing at last the passage by  Congress of an act to protect the Yellowstone National Park, and to  punish crimes and offenses within its borders, though it may be  questioned whether even their efforts would have had any result had not  the public interest been aroused, and the Congressional conscience  pricked, by the wholesale slaughter of buffalo which took place in the  Park in March, 1894, as elsewhere detailed by Capt. Anderson and the  editors. Besides this, the Club has secured the passage, by the New York  Legislature, of an act incorporating the New York Zoological Society,  and a considerable representation of the Club is found in the list of  its officers and managers. Other efforts, made by Boone and Crockett  members in behalf of game and forest protection, have been less  successful, and there is still a wide field for the Club's activities.    Public sentiment should be aroused on the general question of forest  preservation, and especially in the matter of securing legislation which  will adequately protect the game and the forests of the various forest  reservations already established. Special attention was called to this  point in the earlier volume published by the Club, from which we quote:         If it was worth while to establish these reservations, it is worth       while to protect them. A general law, providing for the adequate       guarding of all such national possessions, should be enacted by       Congress, and wherever it may be necessary such Federal laws should       be supplemented by laws of the States in which the reservations       lie. The timber and the game ought to be made the absolute property       of the Government, and it should be constituted a punishable       offense to appropriate such property within the limits of the       reservation. The game and timber on a reservation should be       regarded as Government property, just as are the mules and the       cordwood at an army post. If it is a crime to take the latter, it       should be a crime to plunder a forest reservation.         In these reservations is to be found to-day every species of large       game known to the United States, and the proper protection of the       reservations means the perpetuating in full supply of all the       indigenous mammals. If this care is provided, no species of       American large game need ever become absolutely extinct; and       intelligent effort for game protection may well be directed toward       securing through national legislation the policing of forest       preserves by timber and game wardens.    A really remarkable phenomenon in American animal life, described in the  paper on the Yellowstone Park Protection Act, is the attitude now  assumed toward mankind by the bears, both grizzly and black, in the  Yellowstone National Park. The preservation of the game in the Park has  unexpectedly resulted in turning a great many of the bears into  scavengers for the hotels within the Park limits. Their tameness and  familiarity are astonishing; they act much more like hogs than beasts of  prey. Naturalists now have a chance of studying their character from an  entirely new standpoint, and under entirely new conditions. It would be  well worth the while of any student of nature to devote an entire  season in the Park simply to study of bear life; never before has such  an opportunity been afforded.    The incident mentioned on page 421 was witnessed by Mr. W. Hallett  Phillipps and Col. John Hay. Since this incident occurred, one bear has  made a practice of going into the kitchen of the Geyser Hotel, where he  is fed on pies. If given a chance, the bears will eat the pigs that are  kept in pens near the hotels; but they have not shown any tendency to  molest the horses, or to interfere in any way with the human beings  around the hotels.    These incidents, and the confidence which the elk, deer and other  animals in the Park have come to feel in man, are interesting, for they  show how readily wild creatures may be taught to look upon human beings  as friends.

PREFACE.      \"This is the forest primeval.\" \"It is my home.\" So spoke the moose. Suffice  it is to say, that a prize trophy over one's fireplace is an object to be  admired by one and all. It brings you back to a last hunting trip, and well  do you remember, as you gaze thereon, what a chase it had led you in life,  through bog and alder swamp, until at last an opportunity presented itself  whereby the deadly missile from your rifle sends him to his death. As the  blue rings of smoke from your brier pipe float up and away, you are carried  in thought to the North Woods wherein he roamed. There he lived, a monarch  of all he surveyed. The excitement of the chase, while it is on, knows no  bounds, but at the death it subsides, and you return to civilization to  recall the event only when the time arrives that another pilgrimage to the  happy hunting grounds is in order. On the other hand, you find him as a  subject for your camera. An excellent one, too. Exiled in his domain for a  few weeks and a wealth of enjoyment is yours, as, during the long winter  evenings, you may open your album and see him before you as he was in  life. The smoke from the same pipe will float up and away, and you can for  a moment realize what a happy pastime you have enjoyed while a guest of  Dame Nature in the Haunts of the Moose.          TO HIS LORDSHIP.          \"Deep in the silent forest, where oft I've chanced to roam,      The monarch moose inhabits, it is his woodland home;      By silent lake at morning, by logan, calm at night,      Majestic stands his lordship, stands motionless in sight.      The north wind to him is music, the tall pines are his friends,      The rivers madly rushing, o'er the rocks and round the bends,      Seems to him a heavenly blessing, seems to him the work above      Of a kind and thoughtful Father, and His beings He doth love.\"    [Illustration: BULL MOOSE IN BLACK POND.    (West Branch Waters.)    Photographed from Life.]          CHAPTER I.         HABITS AND HAUNTS. SECTIONS WHERE FOUND. STILL HUNTING.       CALLING. POSSIBLE EXTERMINATION.      Throughout the vast depths of the northern forests, bordered by the virgin  growth of a trackless wilderness, often with an imperial fringe of  timber-crowned hills, lives the moose. He is the largest, as well as the  most highly prized, live game animal extant to-day on the American  continent. Formerly, this species was very abundant throughout the region  of country extending from the wilds of Northern Maine westward through the  wilderness bordering on the Great Lakes and far beyond; but great havoc has  been wrought, especially during the past twenty-five years, in the supply  of this variety of game.    Comparatively few are killed annually in the United States, and those  mostly within the limits of Northern Maine and the States of the far  Northwest, where the pernicious activity of the professional hunters and  self-styled sportsmen, who kill the large beasts during the prevalance of  deep snows, will, if not checked, bring the moose into the list of extinct  species of American game before the close of another decade.    No animal is so persistently hunted, and when killed, none considered so  grand a trophy as his lordship. Owing to the comparatively small section of  this country that he inhabits they are few in number, the Maine and  Canadian wildernesses sheltering by far more moose than any other section.  What few specimens found in far-off Alaska are world beaters in regard to  size of body and spread of antlers, one having been shot in that territory  whose horns measured over eight feet from tip to tip.    The best breeding and feeding grounds are along the Canadian border, while  favorite localities for the sportsmen are in the vicinity of lakes, ponds,  and dead waters throughout the aforementioned sections.    In appearance the moose is large and awkward; its huge head and broad  nose, combined with its short, thick neck, giving it a rather grotesque  appearance. In color, he is brown, while his legs and belly are grayish.  His mane is almost black, and at any approaching danger rises upward,  making him a most formidable foe to look upon.    The moose travels over the ground in a swinging trot, exhibiting remarkable  speed. This style of locomotion is adopted only when the animal is suddenly  started. If the presence of man is detected, while the hunter is yet some  distance away, the moose moves off with considerable caution, often  selecting a course which the follower can pursue only with the greatest  difficulty.    [Illustration: COW MOOSE ON BLACK POND.    (West Branch Waters.)    Photographed from Life.]    The endurance of the animal is such that only the hardiest of hunters can  hope to overtake him in a stern chase when he has once become alarmed. The  broad, palmate antlers are a distinguishing feature, and happy is the  hunter who can boast the possession of a head as a trophy taken from an  animal killed by himself. While few are successful in this respect the  greater majority must be content with perhaps a view of his lordship at a  distance.    Still hunting, or stalking the moose in his native wilds, is a branch of  sport successfully followed by none except the skilled woodsmen and hardy  hunter. The fatigue and countless obstacles to be met with are such that  comparatively few amateur sportsmen attempt it. More frequently the animal  is driven to the water by the guides and woodsmen, or attracted to such  localities by calling.    In Northern Maine and in the Canadian Provinces, the moose is often hunted  during early winter by pursuing him on snow-shoes. Jacking is often  effectively followed in mid-summer, along the lakes and rivers. This method  is considered unsportsmanlike by those who possess the requisite skill and  endurance to adopt the style of still hunting.    In size and weight he exceeds that of the horse, specimens having been shot  that weighed over twelve hundred pounds and stood seven and one-half feet  to the shoulder.    [Illustration: COW MOOSE IN HARRINGTON LAKE.    (West Branch Waters.)    Photographed from Life.]    In the summer he is to be seen feeding in and near the streams on the lily  roots, of which he is exceedingly fond. This is the time of year that he is  easily approached from a canoe as he stands, with head submerged, eating  that dainty morsel. The black flies, at this season, are also to a great  extent responsible for his taking to the water, as any of my readers who  have had a few of these insects on them at one time usually feel disposed  to follow his example in their endeavor to rid themselves of this pest.    As winter approaches he leaves the lakes and streams, forming a yard or  runway by passing to and fro, beating a track, and keeping the snow packed  down hard. These runways are always located where there is good feed to be  had from young hardwood trees, such as the moosewood (a species of ash),  also poplar, birch, and mosses near at hand. He does not feed from the  ground, and, owing to the great height of his forelegs, he can reach from  eight to ten feet to secure his food. Nor are all these twigs tender, for  his lordship makes short work of biting off a sapling an inch through if it  is to his liking.    Moose bring forth their young in May. Two calves are born, as a rule,  though sometimes not more than one. The calf stays with the mother at least  a year, and often two. While the cow moose is a timid animal, she is brave  in defending her young. A story told by a trustworthy Indian guide  illustrates this point.    While paddling on Chesuncook Lake, one day, the guide saw a cow moose and  a calf come down the bank and enter the water. He watched them until they  had waded some distance from shore, when his attention was arrested by  another animal coming out of the woods near them. It was a black bear. The  bear was not seen by the cow. He slipped easily into the water and waded  towards the cow and calf. Presently he got beyond his depth, his legs being  much shorter than even a calf moose's, and therefore had to swim. He swam  directly for the calf, and was rapidly nearing it when the cow saw him. The  ungainly beast turned with remarkable quickness towards the bear, whom she  attacked with her fore feet. Three or four sharp jabs with her pointed  hoofs was enough to insure the protection of her offspring, with whom she  soon left the water. The bear appeared to be _hors de combat_, and the  guide paddled up to him, to find that his back had been broken by the  powerful blows of the cow. The Indian dispatched the"]]]
