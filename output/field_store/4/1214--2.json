Only it grieves me when I understand          What precious time in vanity Ive spent-          The wind it beareth mans frail thoughts away.       Yet, since remorse avails not, Im content,          As erst I came, WELCOME to go one day,          Here in the Flower of this fair Tuscan land.    Introductory Note    AMONG the vast number of men who have thought fit to write down the  history of their own lives, three or four have achieved masterpieces  which stand out preeminently: Saint Augustine in his Confessions,  Samuel Pepys in his Diary, Rousseau in his Confessions. It is among  these extraordinary documents, and unsurpassed by any of them, that the  autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini takes its place.    The Life of himself which Cellini wrote was due to other motives than  those which produced its chief competitors for first place in its class.  St. Augustines aim was religious and didactic, Pepys noted down in his  diary the daily events of his life for his sole satisfaction and with no  intention that any one should read the cipher in which they were  recorded. But Cellini wrote that the world might know, after he was  dead, what a fellow he had been; what great things he had attempted, and  against what odds he had carried them through. All men, he held,  whatever be their condition, who have done anything of merit, or which  verily has a semblance of merit, if so be they are men of truth and good  repute, should write the tale of their life with their own hand. That  he had done many things of merit, he had no manner of doubt. His repute  was great in his day, and perhaps good in the sense in which he meant  goodness; as to whether he was a man of truth, there is still dispute  among scholars. Of some misrepresentations, some suppressions of  damaging facts, there seems to be evidence only too good-a man with  Cellinis passion for proving himself in the right could hardly have  avoided being guilty of such-; but of the general trustworthiness of his  record, of the kind of man he was and the kind of life he led, there is  no reasonable doubt.    The period covered by the autobiography is from Cellinis birth in 1500  to 1562; the scene is mainly in Italy and France. Of the great events of  the time, the time of the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, of  the strife of Pope and Emperor and King, we get only glimpses. The  leaders in these events appear in the foreground of the picture only  when they come into personal relations with the hero; and then not  mainly as statesmen or warriors, but as connoisseurs and patrons of art.  Such an event as the Sack of Rome is described because Benvenuto himself  fought in it.    Much more complete is the view he gives of the artistic life of the  time. It was the age of Michelangelo, and in the throng of great artists  which then filled the Italian cities, Cellini was no inconsiderable  figure. Michelangelo himself he knew and adored. Nowhere can we gain a  better idea than in this book of the passionate enthusiasm for the  creation of beauty which has bestowed upon the Italy of the Renaissance  its greatest glory.    Very vivid, too, is the impression we receive of the social life of the  sixteenth century; of its violence and licentiousness, of its zeal for  fine craftsmanship, of its abounding vitality, its versatility and its  idealism. For Cellini himself is an epitome of that century. This man  who tells here the story of his life was a murderer and a braggart,  insolent, sensual, inordinately proud and passionate; but he was also a  worker in gold and silver, rejoicing in delicate chasing and subtle  modelling of precious surfaces; a sculptor and a musician; and, as all  who read his book must testify, a great master of narrative. Keen as was  Benvenutos interest in himself, and much as he loved to dwell on the  splendor of his exploits and achievements, he had little idea that  centuries after his death he would live again, less by his Perseus and  his goldsmiths work than by the book which he dictated casually to a  lad of fourteen, while he went about his work.    The autobiography was composed between 1558 and 1566, but it brings the  record down only to 1562. The remainder of Cellinis life seems to have  been somewhat more peaceful. In 1565 he married Piera de Salvadore  Parigi, a servant who had nursed him when he was sick; and in the care  of his children, as earlier of his sister and nieces, he showed more  tenderness than might have been expected from a man of his boisterous  nature. He died at Florence, May 13, 1571, and was buried in The Church  of the Annunziata in that city.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------    Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini    I    ALL men of whatsoever quality they be, who have done anything of  excellence, or which may properly resemble excellence, ought, if they  are persons of truth and honesty, to describe their life with their own  hand; but they ought not to attempt so fine an enterprise till they have  passed the age of forty. This duty occurs to my own mind now that I am  travelling beyond the term of fifty-eight years, and am in Florence, the  city of my birth. Many untoward things can I remember, such as happen to  all who live upon our earth; and from those adversities I am now more  free than at any previous period of my career-nay, it seems to me that I  enjoy greater content of soul and health of body than ever I did in  bygone years. I can also bring to mind some pleasant goods and some  inestimable evils, which, when I turn my thoughts backward, strike  terror in me, and astonishment that I should have reached this age of  fifty-eight, wherein, thanks be to God, I am still travelling  prosperously forward.    II    IT is true that men who have laboured with some show of excellence, have  already given knowledge of themselves to the world; and this alone ought  to suffice them; I mean the fact that they have proved their manhood and  achieved renown. Yet one must needs live like others; and so in a work  like this there will always be found occasion for natural bragging,  which is of divers kinds, and the first is that a man should let others  know he draws his lineage from persons of worth and most ancient origin.    I am called Benvenuto Cellini, son of Maestro Giovanni, son of Andrea,  son of Cristofano Cellini; my mother was Madonna Elisabetta, daughter to  Stefano Granacci; both parents citizens of Florence. It is found written  in chronicles made by our ancestors of Florence, men of old time and of  credibility, even as Giovanni Villani writes, that the city of Florence  was evidently built in imitation of the fair city of Rome; and certain  remnants of the Colosseum and the Baths can yet be traced. These things  are near Santa Croce. The Capitol was where is now the Old Market. The  Rotonda is entire, which was made for the temple of Mars, and is now  dedicated to our Saint John. That thus is was, can very well be seen,  and cannot be denied, but the said buildings are much smaller than those  of Rome. He who caused them to built, they say, was Julius Cæsar, in  concert with some noble Romans, who, when Fiesole had been stormed and  taken, raised a city in this place, and each of them took in hand to  erect one of these notable edifices.    Julius Cæsar had among his captains a man of highest rank and valour,  who was called Fiorino of Cellino, which is a village about two miles  distant from Monte Fiascone. Now this Fiorino took up his quarters under  the hill of Fiesole, on the ground where Florence now stands, in order  to be near the river Arno, and for the convenience of the troops. All  those soldiers and others who had to do with the said captain, used then  to say: Let us go to Fiorenze; as well because the said captain was  called Fiorino, as also because the place he had chosen for his quarters  was by nature very rich in flowers. Upon the foundation of the city,  therefore, since this name struck Julius Cæsar as being fair and apt,  and given by circumstance, and seeing furthermore that flowers  themselves bring good augury, he appointed the name of Florence for the  town. He wished besides to pay his valiant captain this compliment; and  he loved him all the more for having drawn him from a very humble place,  and for the reason that so excellent a man was a creature of his own.  The name that learned inventors and investigators of such etymologies  adduce, as that Florence is flowing at the Arno, cannot hold; seeing  that Rome is flowing at the Tiber, Ferrara is flowing at the Po, Lyons  is flowing at the Saone, Paris is flowing at the Seine, and yet the  names of all these towns are different, and have come to them by other  ways. [1]    Thus then we find; and thus we believe that we are descended from a man  of worth. Furthermore, we find that there are Cellinis of our stock in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#1)"],[1,"STUDIES: A SERIES OF ESSAYS    By WALTER HORATIO PATER    E-text Editor: Alfred J.

It is not intended as a substitute  for the printed original but rather as a searchable supplement.  My  e-texts may prove convenient substitutes for hard-to-get works in a  course where both instructor and students accept the possibility of  some imperfections in the text, but if you are writing a scholarly  article, dissertation, or book, you should use the standard hard-copy  editions of any works you cite.    Pagination and Paragraphing: To avoid an unwieldy electronic copy, I  have transferred original pagination to brackets.  A bracketed  numeral such as [22] indicates that the material immediately  following the number marks the beginning of the relevant page.  I  have preserved paragraph structure except for first-line indentation.    Hyphenation: I have not preserved original hyphenation since an e-  text does not require line-end or page-end hyphenation.

SHADWELL    [1] THE present volume consists of a collection of essays by the  late Mr. Pater, all of which have already been given to the public in  various Magazines; and it is owing to the kindness of the several  proprietors of those Magazines that they can now be brought together  in a collected shape.  It will, it is believed, be felt, that their  value is considerably enhanced by their appearance in a single  volume, where they can throw light upon one another, and exhibit by  their connexion a more complete view of the scope and purpose of Mr.  Pater in dealing with the art and literature of the ancient world.    The essays fall into two distinct groups, one dealing with the  subjects of Greek mythology and Greek poetry, the other with the  history of Greek sculpture and Greek architecture.  But these two  groups are not wholly distinct; they mutually illustrate one another,  and serve to enforce Mr. Pater's conception of the essential [2]  unity, in all its many-sidedness, of the Greek character.  The god  understood as the \"spiritual form\" of the things of nature is not  only the key-note of the \"Study of Dionysus\"* and \"The Myth of  Demeter and Persephone,\"* but reappears as contributing to the  interpretation of the growth of Greek sculpture.*  Thus, though in  the bibliography of his writings, the two groups are separated by a  considerable interval, there is no change of view; he had already  reached the centre of the problem, and, the secret once gained, his  mode of treatment of the different aspects of Greek life and thought  is permanent and consistent.    The essay on \"The Myth of Demeter and Persephone\" was originally  prepared as two lectures, for delivery, in 1875, at the Birmingham  and Midland Institute.  These lectures were published in the  Fortnightly Review, in Jan. and Feb. 1876.  The \"Study of Dionysus\"  appeared in the same Review in Dec. 1876.  \"The Bacchanals of  Euripides\" must have been written about the same time, as a sequel to  the \"Study of Dionysus\"; for, in 1878, Mr. Pater revised the four  essays, with the intention, apparently, of publishing them  collectively in a volume, an intention afterwards abandoned. [3] The  text now printed has, except that of \"The Bacchanals,\" been taken  from proofs then set up, further corrected in manuscript.  \"The  Bacchanals,\" written long before, was not published until 1889, when  it appeared in Macmillan's Magazine for May.  It was reprinted,  without alteration, prefixed to Dr. Tyrrell's edition of the Bacchae.  \"Hippolytus Veiled\" first appeared in August 1889, in Macmillan's  Magazine.  It was afterwards rewritten, but with only a few  substantial alterations, in Mr. Pater's own hand, with a view,  probably, of republishing it with other essays.  This last revise has  been followed in the text now printed.    The papers on Greek sculpture* are all that remain of a series which,  if Mr. Pater had lived, would, probably, have grown into a still more  important work.  Such a work would have included one or more essays  on Phidias and the Parthenon, of which only a fragment, though an  important fragment, can be found amongst his papers; and it was to  have been prefaced by an Introduction to Greek Studies, only a page  or two of which was ever written.    [4] This is not the place to speak of Mr. Pater's private virtues,  the personal charm of his character, the brightness of his talk, the  warmth of his friendship, the devotion of his family life.  But a few  words may be permitted on the value of the work by which he will be  known to those who never saw him.    Persons only superficially acquainted, or by hearsay, with his  writings, are apt to sum up his merits as a writer by saying that he  was a master, or a consummate master of style; but those who have  really studied what he wrote do not need to be told that his  distinction does not lie in his literary grace alone, his fastidious  choice of language, his power of word-painting, but in the depth and  seriousness of his studies.  That the amount he has produced, in a  literary life of thirty years, is not greater, is one proof among  many of the spirit in which he worked.  His genius was \"an infinite  capacity for taking pains.\"  That delicacy of insight, that gift of  penetrating into the heart of things, that subtleness of  interpretation, which with him seems an instinct, is the outcome of  hard, patient, conscientious study.  If he had chosen, he might,  without difficulty, have produced a far greater body of work of less  value; and from a worldly point of view, he would have been wise.  Such was not his understanding [5] of the use of his talents.  Cui  multum datum est, multum quaeretur ab eo.  Those who wish to  understand the spirit in which he worked, will find it in this  volume.  C.L.S.    Oct. 1894.

A STUDY OF DIONYSUS:  THE SPIRITUAL FORM OF FIRE AND DEW    [9] WRITERS on mythology speak habitually of the religion of the  Greeks.  In thus speaking, they are really using a misleading  expression, and should speak rather of religions; each race and class  of Greeks--the Dorians, the people of the coast, the fishers--having  had a religion of its own, conceived of the objects that came nearest  to it and were most in its thoughts, and the resulting usages and  ideas never having come to have a precisely harmonised system, after  the analogy of some other religions.  The religion of Dionysus is the  religion of people who pass their lives among the vines.  As the  religion of Demeter carries us back to the cornfields and farmsteads  of Greece, and places us, in fancy, among a primitive race, in the  furrow and beside the granary; so the religion of Dionysus carries us  back to its vineyards, and is a monument of the ways and thoughts of  people whose days go by beside the winepress, and [10] under the  green and purple shadows, and whose material happiness depends on the  crop of grapes.  For them the thought of Dionysus and his circle, a  little Olympus outside the greater, covered the whole of life, and  was a complete religion, a sacred representation or interpretation of  the whole human experience, modified by the special limitations, the  special"]]]
