NEW YORK    TAIT, SONS & COMPANY    Union Square      Copyright, 1891.    BY HERBERT D. WARD.          A REPUBLIC WITHOUT A PRESIDENT.          PART I.          On the morning of the eighth of June, 1893, at about ten o'clock, crowds  were seen clustered in front of the daily newspaper bulletins in New  York, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Boston. The excitement  rivalled that occasioned by the assassination of Garfield, and by night  the country was as bewildered and aghast as when the news came that  Lincoln was murdered. This was the announcement as it appeared in  blood-red, gigantic capitals by the door of the New York _Tribune_  building:        UNPRECEDENTED CALAMITY!        AWFUL MYSTERY!        THE PRESIDENT AND HIS WIFE SPIRITED AWAY FROM      THE WHITE HOUSE!        TWO SERVANTS FOUND GAGGED!        NOT A TRACE OF THE DISTINGUISHED COUPLE!        THE COUNTRY AGHAST AT THE DREADFUL POSSIBILITIES      OF THIS DISAPPEARANCE!    Extras found enormous sales, but they contained no more news than this.  Business was brought to a standstill and stocks fell in half an hour  from five to twenty per cent. The land was convulsed. It was true that  there were those who thought the whole thing a colossal hoax perpetrated  by the defeated party. But as time went on the startling and incredible  news was confirmed. The evening edition of the New York _Sun_ had these  ominous headers.        THE PRESIDENT AND HIS WIFE HAVE ACTUALLY DISAPPEARED.        THE GAGGED SERVANTS OF THE WHITE HOUSE TELL      THEIR STORY.        THEY ARE IN PRISON ON GRAVE SUSPICION OF CONSPIRACY.        THE CARD OF AN EMINENT POLITICIAN FOUND IN THE      VESTIBULE OF THE EXECUTIVE MANSION.        IS A DARK POLITICAL PLOT ABOUT TO BE UNEARTHED?    The next day found the situation unchanged. Rumors of every description  ran wild. Telegrams of condolence from all the sovereigns of the world  were received at Washington by the dazed Department of State. These were  fully given to the omnivorous press. By order of the Vice-President, all  other news was for the present rigorously withheld from publication. To  this censorship the press submitted cordially. Mystery was brooding over  the land, and despair laughed detectives in the face. Men met each other  and asked only this question:    \"Have they been found?\"    A sad shake of the head always followed.    \"No wonder,\" the Governor of Massachusetts was heard to say, \"with  thousands of assassins coming over here every year. Even our President  was not safe. God help our country!\"    At the end of a few days the full news, as far as it went, was  published, and the nation then drew its second breath. The facts about  this stupendous abduction, as given to the public by the end of the  week, were briefly these: This is the affidavit of the night sentry, who  was stationed in the vestibule of the White House.    \"My name is George Henry. I am thirty-four years old. I was born in this  country. My father was a slave. It was about one-thirty last night when  I was aroused by a double rap at the main entrance. I was not asleep,  but I may have been a little sleepy. I asked who was there, and a voice  answered that the Secretary of State wished to see the President on  business of the greatest importance. I answered that the President was  in bed. He said that he must see the President immediately. Then I  thought I recognized the voice of Mr. Secretary. I opened the door and,  sure enough, Mr. Secretary entered. He had on a silk hat and the gray  overcoat he usually wears. He gave me his card, and told me to take it  right up to the President. The door was left open and I noticed it was  raining. The carriage of the Secretary was standing under the portico. I  did not see the coachman. When I bowed and turned to go upstairs there  was a strange smell in the air, and I remember nothing more.\"    The cross-examination brought out from the prisoner, who seemed to  answer honestly and intelligently, that he was sure it was the Secretary  of State, but his voice seemed changed by a cold. He felt positive about  the carriage, for he recognized the team, a gray and a black. He heard  no voices outside. When chloroform was produced, he said that was the  same smell, but there was something more that was considerably tarter.  He persisted in the same story, and repeated it over and over without  variation. It looked dubious for his excellency the Secretary of State.    The next witness was the night sentry on the second floor. He was badly  frightened, was a little confused, but told a straight story. His  deposition was as follows:    \"Yes, sah, my name is Frank Steven. I have alluz been a colored man. I  was bahn in Ohio when I was twelve years old.\" [At this juncture a glass  of ice water restored the equilibrium of the witness.] \"I moved to Ohio  when I was twelve years old. I was born in Mississipy. I'm forty-two  now, I think. It might have been half after one or two when I heard a  step a-coming up the stairs. I went to the landing and saw Mr. Secretary  of State a-coming up with his hat on; and how he got there the Lawd only  knows. He told me to show him to Mr. President's room. He spoke mighty  sharp, and I thought it was all right, so I led the way. When I was  a-going to knock at Mr. President's door, he told me to stop and have a  cigar first. He never offered me one before, and I was mighty surprised.  There was a strange smell, like an apothecary store and I don't know  anything more about it. That is all I know, sir.\"    Subsequent examination brought out no new fact, except that the prisoner  remembered that the Secretary coughed behind a handkerchief as he spoke,  and that one hand was concealed under his gray overcoat; this was pulled  over his ears. The thing that struck him most was that the Secretary  kept his hat on during the whole interview. The watchman had never known  him to keep his hat on in the house before. Like the first witness, he  recognized the odor of chloroform, and thought there was something else  besides. He was surprised to find himself gagged and bound when he came  to.    As the two witnesses corroborated each other, and as neither had any  communication with the other, they were substantially believed. The fact  that this testimony was indisputably damaging to the Secretary of State,  and the further circumstantial evidence of his card having been  recovered from the floor of the lower vestibule, caused the  investigating committee, of which Inspector Byrnes was the chairman,  rigorously to exclude all reporters, lest the evidence might make it, to  say the least, uncomfortable for the suspected dignitary. It was natural  that, by ten o'clock on the morning of the drama, a secret guard should  be placed over the head of the Department of State, though no movement  was made as yet toward his arrest.    The next witness of importance was the President's valet, who swore that  the President retired unusually early that night and dismissed him with  the special injunction that the house should be kept quiet, as the  President had a headache and wished perfect rest.    It may be well to state here that the new incumbent of the presidential  chair shared with his wife the traditions of Jeffersonian simplicity of  living, and that they departed so little from their original home habits  that house detectives were abolished, and the distinguished pair lived,  entertained, and slept with as scant formality as the sovereign people  allowed. The doors communicating with their sleeping apartments were  rarely locked. Full dependence for safety was placed upon the two  trusted watchmen whose deposition has been given.    The children and their attendants, who slept in adjacent rooms, heard no  noise during the night. In short, none but the two under strict arrest  were aware of the entrance of any person or persons after twelve  o'clock. In the meanwhile, detectives were stationed unostentatiously  throughout the White House, watching with professional acuteness the  movements of everyone within its doors.    At eleven o'clock precisely on the morning of the ninth of June,  Inspector Byrnes and the chief of the Washington police drove up in a  hack to the door of the Secretary's mansion, and requested a private  interview. Within was feverish commotion. Senators and Representatives,  public officials and men of eminence were sending in their cards and  excitedly discussing the dreadful news. Telegrams were beginning to pour  in. The first impression was confirmed that a political coup or revenge  was at the bottom of the shocking affair, and whispers were mysteriously  exchanged between sombre and stately heads.    When the Secretary saw the cards he immediately withdrew, with an aside  to the Secretary of War: \"This visit may clear up some of the mystery.\"  These words were not calculated to soothe the impatience of the inner  circle.    When the three were alone in the private office, the chief of the  Washington police force tersely opened the subject. He was a blunt  official of adamantine integrity, a veteran of the war.    \"Mr. Secretary,\" he began, \"this is the saddest day the country has  known for many a year. You must pardon me if I ask you a few leading  questions.\"    Inspector Byrnes sat with his back to the light; for, with an inimitable  fashion of his own, he had, upon entering, made a debouch between two  chairs and a table, forcing the Secretary to sit with his face to the  glare of the window.
