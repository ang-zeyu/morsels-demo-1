WITH ILLUSTRATIONS FROM PHOTOGRAPHS  BY THE AUTHOR      NEW YORK  CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS  1908          TO  MY OLD FRIEND  SEYMOUR LUCAS, R.A., F.S.A.  THIS BOOK  IS AFFECTIONATELY  INSCRIBED          A recent glance over some old Ordnance Maps, the companions of many a  ramble in the corners of Old England, has suggested the idea of jotting  down a few fragmentary notes, which we trust may be of interest.    Upon a former occasion we wandered with pencil and camera haphazard off  the beaten track mainly in the counties surrounding the great  Metropolis; and though there are several tempting \"Nooks\" still near at  hand, we have now extended our range of exploration.    We only trust the reader will derive a little of the pleasure we have  found in compiling this little volume.      A. F.

Prologue    The First Book of Adam and Eve details the life and times of Adam and  Eve after they were expelled from the garden to the time that Cain  kills his brother Abel.  It tells of Adam and Eve's first dwelling--the  Cave of Treasures; their trials and temptations; Satan's many  apparitions to them; the birth of Cain, Abel, and their twin sisters;  and Cain's love for his beautiful twin sister, Luluwa, whom Adam and  Eve wished to join to Abel.    This book is considered by many scholars to be part of the  \"Pseudepigrapha\" (soo-duh-pig-ruh-fuh).  The \"Pseudepigrapha\" is a  collection of historical biblical works that are considered to be  fiction.  Because of that stigma, this book was not included in the  compilation of the Holy Bible.  This book is a written history of what  happened in the days of Adam and Eve after they were cast out of the  garden. Although considered to be pseudepigraphic by some, it carries  significant meaning and insight into events of that time.  It is  doubtful that these writings could have survived all the many centuries  if there were no substance to them.    This book is simply a version of an account handed down by word of  mouth, from generation to generation, linking the time that the first  human life was created to the time when somebody finally decided to  write it down.  This particular version is the work of unknown  Egyptians.  The lack of historical allusion makes it difficult to  precisely date the writing, however, using other pseudepigraphical  works as a reference, it was probably written a few hundred years  before the birth of Christ.  Parts of this version are found in the  Jewish Talmud, and the Islamic Koran, showing what a vital role it  played in the original literature of human wisdom.  The Egyptian author  wrote in Arabic, but later translations were found written in Ethiopic.  The present English translation was translated in the late 1800's by  Dr. S. C. Malan and Dr. E. Trumpp.  They translated into King James  English from both the Arabic version and the Ethiopic version which was  then published in The Forgotten Books of Eden in 1927 by The World  Publishing Company.  In 1995, the text was extracted from a copy of  The Forgotten Books of Eden and converted to electronic form by Dennis  Hawkins.  It was then translated into more modern English by simply  exchanging 'Thou' s for 'You's, 'Art's for 'Are's, and so forth.  The  text was then carefully re-read to ensure its integrity.          Chapter I - The crystal sea, God commands Adam, expelled from Eden, to  live in the Cave of Treasures.      1 On the third day, God planted the garden in the east of the earth, on  the border of the world eastward, beyond which, towards the sun-rising,  one finds nothing but water, that encompasses the whole world, and  reaches to the borders of heaven.    2 And to the north of the garden there is a sea of water, clear and  pure to the taste, unlike anything else; so that, through the clearness  thereof, one may look into the depths of the earth.    3 And when a man washes himself in it, he becomes clean of the  cleanness thereof, and white of its whiteness--even if he were dark.    4 And God created that sea of his own good pleasure, for He knew what  would come of the man He would make; so that after he had left the  garden, on account of his transgression, men should be born in the  earth.  Among them are righteous ones who will die, whose souls God  would raise at the last day; when all of them will return to their  flesh, bathe in the water of that sea, and repent of their sins.    5 But when God made Adam go out of the garden, He did not place him on  the border of it northward.  This was so that he and Eve would not be  able to go near to the sea of water where they could wash themselves in  it, be cleansed from their sins, erase the transgression they had  committed, and be no longer reminded of it in the thought of their  punishment.    6 As to the southern side of the garden, God did not want Adam to live  there either; because, when the wind blew from the north, it would  bring him, on that southern side, the delicious smell of the trees of  the garden.    7 Wherefore God did not put Adam there.  This was so that he would not  be able to smell the sweet smell of those"]]]
