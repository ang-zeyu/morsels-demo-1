The Nubian desert--The bitter well--Change of plans--An irascible  dragoman--Pools of the Atbara--One secret of the Nile--At Cassala.    In March, 1861, I commenced an expedition to discover the sources of the  Nile, with the hope of meeting the East African expedition of Captains  Speke and Grant, that had been sent by the English Government from the  South via Zanzibar, for the same object. I had not the presumption to  publish my intention, as the sources of the Nile had hitherto defied all  explorers, but I had inwardly determined to accomplish this difficult  task or to die in the attempt. From my youth I had been inured to  hardships and endurance in wild sports in tropical climates, and when I  gazed upon the map of Africa I had a wild hope, mingled with humility,  that, even as the insignificant worm bores through the hardest oak, I  might by perseverance reach the heart of Africa.    I could not conceive that anything in this world has power to resist a  determined will, so long as health and life remain. The failure of every  former attempt to reach the Nile source did not astonish me, as the  expeditions had consisted of parties, which, when difficulties occur,  generally end in difference of opinion and in retreat; I therefore  determined to proceed alone, trusting in the guidance of a Divine  Providence and the good fortune that sometimes attends a tenacity of  purpose. I weighed carefully the chances of the undertaking. Before me,  untrodden Africa; against me, the obstacles that had defeated the world  since its creation; on my side, a somewhat tough constitution, perfect  independence, a long experience in savage life, and both time and means,  which I intended to devote to the object without limit.    England had never sent an expedition to the Nile sources previous to  that under the command of Speke and Grant. Bruce, ninety years before,  had succeeded in tracing the source of the Blue or Lesser Nile; thus the  honor of that discovery belonged to Great Britain. Speke was on his road  from the South, and I felt confident that my gallant friend would leave  his bones upon the path rather than submit to failure. I trusted that  England would not be beaten, and although I hardly dared to hope that  I could succeed where others greater than I had failed, I determined to  sacrifice all in the attempt.    Had I been alone, it would have been no hard lot to die upon the  untrodden path before me; but there was one who, although my greatest  comfort, was also my greatest care, one whose life yet dawned at so  early an age that womanhood was still a future. I shuddered at the  prospect for her, should she be left alone in savage lands at my death;  and gladly would I have left her in the luxuries of home instead of  exposing her to the miseries of Africa. It was in vain that I implored  her to remain, and that I painted the difficulties and perils still  blacker than I supposed they really would be. She was resolved, with  woman's constancy and devotion, to share all dangers and to follow me  through each rough footstep of the wild life before me. \"And Ruth said,  Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee;  for whither thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge;  thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou diest will  I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also,  if aught but death part thee and me.\"    Thus accompanied by my wife, on the 15th of April, 1861, I sailed up the  Nile from Cairo. The wind blew fair and strong from the north, and we  flew toward the south against the stream, watching those mysterious  waters with a firm resolve to track them to their distant fountain.    I had a firman from the Viceroy, a cook, and a dragoman. Thus my  impedimenta were not numerous. The firman was an order to all Egyptian  officials for assistance; the cook was dirty and incapable; and the  interpreter was nearly ignorant of English, although a professed  polyglot. With this small beginning, Africa was before me, and thus I  commenced the search for the sources of the Nile.    On arrival at Korosko, twenty-six days from Cairo, we started across the  Nubian Desert. During the cool months, from November until February, the  desert journey is not disagreeable; but the vast area of glowing sand  exposed to the scorching sun of summer, in addition to the withering  breath of the simoom, renders the forced march of two hundred and thirty  miles in seven days, at two and a half miles per hour, one of the most  fatiguing journeys that can be endured.    We entered a dead level plain of orange-colored sand, surrounded by  pyramidical hills. The surface was strewn with objects resembling cannon  shot and grape of all sizes from a 32-pounder downward, and looked like  the old battle-field of some infernal region--rocks glowing with heat,  not a vestige of vegetation, barren, withering desolation. The slow  rocking step of the camels was most irksome, and, despite the heat, I  dismounted to examine the Satanic bombs and cannon shot. Many of  them were as perfectly round as though cast in a mould, others were  egg-shaped, and all were hollow. With some difficulty I broke them, and  found them to contain a bright red sand. They were, in fact, volcanic  bombs that had been formed by the ejection of molten lava to a great  height from active volcanoes; these had become globular in falling, and,  having cooled before they reached the earth, they retained their forms  as hard spherical bodies, precisely resembling cannon shot. The exterior  was brown, and appeared to be rich in iron. The smaller specimens  were the more perfect spheres, as they cooled quickly; but many of  the heavier masses had evidently reached the earth when only half  solidified, and had collapsed upon falling. The sandy plain was covered  with such vestiges of volcanic action, and the infernal bombs lay as  imperishable relics of a hailstorm such as may have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32376"],[0,"Notes on Stable Management in India and the Colonies (#1)"],[1,"https://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images  generously made available by The Internet Archive/American  Libraries.)

NUNN, F.R.C.V.S., C.I.E., D.S.O.,      ARMY VETERINARY DEPARTMENT,    LATE PRINCIPAL LAHORE VETERINARY COLLEGE.        SECOND EDITION, REVISED AND ENLARGED,    WITH A GLOSSARY.        LONDON:    W. THACKER & CO., 2, CREED LANE.    CALCUTTA: THACKER, SPINK & CO.    1897.      [_All rights reserved._]          LONDON:    PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED,    STAMFORD STREET AND CHARING CROSS.          PREFACE.      The first edition of these notes, which was written in India, having been  sold out in a much shorter space of time than I ever anticipated when I  wrote it, I am induced to offer this to the public. The scope of the  original pamphlet has been adhered to, and all that is aimed at is to give  the new arrival in the East some idea as to the management of his horses,  especially those who are setting up a stable for the first time. The first  edition was written in India for Anglo-Indians, who are familiar with  native terms; but to this, being published in England, I have added a  glossary of the more ordinary Hindustani words likely to be of use. The  spelling of these will be probably found fault with by the Oriental  scholar; but I have endeavoured to bring it as near the sound as possible,  as it is only intended for persons in absolute ignorance of the  vernacular. There appearing to be a demand for the book in the colonies,  at the suggestion of the publishers I have added a few remarks on  Australia and South Africa. The entire work has been rewritten, and the  matter contained is the result of my own personal observations during  eighteen years' service in India and the colonies at both military and  civil duties.    JOSHUA A. NUNN.      LONDON,      _March_, 1897.          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.      The following notes on Stable Management were originally delivered in a  lecture to the Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Troopers of the  Punjab Light Horse, and as they were considered by the members of the  corps to be useful, at their request I have put them on paper. There is no  attempt at anything beyond the most elementary rudiments of horse-keeping  in India, and all they are intended for is to give volunteers of mounted  corps, who have not previously owned horses, some slight idea as to what  should be done for the care of their chargers, and not leave them entirely  in the hands of native syces and horse-keepers.
