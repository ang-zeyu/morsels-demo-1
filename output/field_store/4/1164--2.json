AS FAR AS PALERMO.      Comes over one an absolute necessity to move. And what is more, to move  in some particular direction. A double necessity then: to get on the  move, and to know whither.    Why can't one sit still? Here in Sicily it is so pleasant: the sunny  Ionian sea, the changing jewel of Calabria, like a fire-opal moved in  the light; Italy and the panorama of Christmas clouds, night with the  dog-star laying a long, luminous gleam across the sea, as if baying at  us, Orion marching above; how the dog-star Sirius looks at one, looks at  one! he is the hound of heaven, green, glamorous and fierce!--and then  oh regal evening star, hung westward flaring over the jagged dark  precipices of tall Sicily: then Etna, that wicked witch, resting her  thick white snow under heaven, and slowly, slowly rolling her  orange-coloured smoke. They called her the Pillar of Heaven, the  Greeks. It seems wrong at first, for she trails up in a long, magical,  flexible line from the sea's edge to her blunt cone, and does not seem  tall. She seems rather low, under heaven. But as one knows her better,  oh awe and wizardy! Remote under heaven, aloof, so near, yet never with  us. The painters try to paint her, and the photographers to photograph  her, in vain. Because why? Because the near ridges, with their olives  and white houses, these are with us. Because the river-bed, and Naxos  under the lemon groves, Greek Naxos deep under dark-leaved, many-fruited  lemon groves, Etna's skirts and skirt-bottoms, these still are our  world, our own world. Even the high villages among the oaks, on Etna.  But Etna herself, Etna of the snow and secret changing winds, she is  beyond a crystal wall. When I look at her, low, white, witch-like under  heaven, slowly rolling her orange smoke and giving sometimes a breath of  rose-red flame, then I must look away from earth, into the ether, into  the low empyrean. And there, in that remote region, Etna is alone. If  you would see her, you must slowly take off your eyes from the world and  go a naked seer to the strange chamber of the empyrean. Pedestal of  heaven! The Greeks had a sense of the magic truth of things. Thank  goodness one still knows enough about them to find one's kinship at  last. There are so many photographs, there are so infinitely many  water-colour drawings and oil paintings which purport to render Etna.  But pedestal of heaven! You must cross the invisible border. Between the  foreground, which is our own, and Etna, pivot of winds in lower heaven,  there is a dividing line. You must change your state of mind. A  metempsychosis. It is no use thinking you can see and behold Etna and  the foreground both at once. Never. One or the other. Foreground and a  transcribed Etna. Or Etna, pedestal of heaven.    Why, then, must one go? Why not stay? Ah, what a mistress, this Etna!  with her strange winds prowling round her like Circe's panthers, some  black, some white. With her strange, remote communications and her  terrible dynamic exhalations. She makes men mad. Such terrible  vibrations of wicked and beautiful electricity she throws about her,  like a deadly net! Nay, sometimes, verily, one can feel a new current of  her demon magnetism seize one's living tissue and change the peaceful  life of one's active cells. She makes a storm in the living plasm and a  new adjustment. And sometimes it is like a madness.    This timeless Grecian Etna, in her lower-heaven loveliness, so lovely,  so lovely, what a torturer! Not many men can really stand her, without  losing their souls. She is like Circe. Unless a man is very strong, she  takes his soul away from him and leaves him not a beast, but an  elemental creature, intelligent and soulless. Intelligent, almost  inspired, and soulless, like the Etna Sicilians. Intelligent daimons,  and humanly, according to us, the most stupid people on earth. Ach,  horror! How many men, how many races, has Etna put to flight? It was she  who broke the quick of the Greek soul. And after the Greeks, she gave  the Romans, the Normans, the Arabs, the Spaniards, the French, the  Italians, even the English, she gave them all their inspired hour and  broke their souls.    Perhaps it is she one must flee from. At any rate, one must go: and at  once. After having come back only at the end of October, already one  must dash away. And it is only the third of January. And one cannot  afford to move. Yet there you are: at the Etna bidding one goes.           *       *       *       *       *    Where does one go? There is Girgenti by the south. There is Tunis at  hand. Girgenti, and the sulphur spirit and the Greek guarding temples,  to make one madder? Never. Neither Syracuse and the madness of its great  quarries. Tunis? Africa? Not yet, not yet. Not the Arabs, not yet.  Naples, Rome, Florence? No good at all. Where then?    Where then? Spain or Sardinia. Spain or Sardinia. Sardinia, which is  like nowhere. Sardinia, which has no history, no date, no race, no  offering. Let it be Sardinia. They say neither Romans nor Phoenicians,  Greeks nor Arabs ever subdued Sardinia. It lies outside; outside the  circuit of civilisation. Like the Basque lands. Sure enough, it is  Italian now, with its railways and its motor-omnibuses. But there is an  uncaptured Sardinia still. It lies within the net of this European  civilisation, but it isn't landed yet. And the net is getting old and  tattered. A good many fish are slipping through the net of the old  European civilisation. Like that great whale of Russia. And probably  even Sardinia. Sardinia then. Let it be Sardinia.           *       *       *       *       *    There is a fortnightly boat sailing from Palermo--next Wednesday, three  days ahead. Let us go, then. Away from abhorred Etna, and the Ionian  sea, and these great stars in the water, and the almond trees in bud,  and the orange trees heavy with red fruit, and these maddening,  exasperating, impossible Sicilians, who never knew what truth was and  have long lost all notion of what a human being is. A sort of  sulphureous demons. _Andiamo!_    But let me confess, in parenthesis, that I am not at all sure whether I  don't really prefer these demons to our sanctified humanity.    Why does one create such discomfort for oneself! To have to get up in  the middle of the night--half past one--to go and look at the clock. Of  course this fraud of an American watch has stopped, with its impudent  phosphorescent face. Half past one! Half past one, and a dark January  night. Ah, well! Half past one! And an uneasy sleep till at last it is  five o'clock. Then light a candle and get up.    The dreary black morning, the candle-light, the house looking  night-dismal. Ah, well, one does all these things for one's pleasure. So  light the charcoal fire and put the kettle on. The queen bee shivering  round half dressed, fluttering her unhappy candle.    \"It's fun,\" she says, shuddering.    \"Great,\" say I, grim as death.    First fill the thermos with hot tea. Then fry bacon--good English bacon  from Malta, a god-send, indeed--and make bacon sandwiches. Make also  sandwiches of scrambled eggs. Make also bread and butter. Also a little  toast for breakfast--and more tea. But ugh, who wants to eat at this  unearthly hour, especially when one is escaping from bewitched Sicily.    Fill the little bag we call the kitchenino. Methylated spirit, a small  aluminium saucepan, a spirit-lamp, two spoons, two forks, a knife, two  aluminium plates, salt, sugar, tea--what else? The thermos flask, the  various sandwiches, four apples, and a little tin of butter. So much for  the kitchenino, for myself and the queen bee. Then my knapsack and the  q-b's handbag.    Under the lid of the half-cloudy night sky, far away at the rim of the  Ionian sea, the first light, like metal fusing. So swallow the cup of  tea and the bit of toast. Hastily wash up, so that we can find the house  decent when we come back. Shut the door-windows of the upper terrace and  go down. Lock the door: the upper half of the house made fast.    The sky and sea are parting like an oyster shell, with a low red gape.  Looking across from the veranda at it, one shivers. Not that it is cold.  The morning is not at all cold. But the ominousness of it: that long red  slit between a dark sky and a dark Ionian sea, terrible old bivalve  which has held life between its lips so long. And here, at this house,  we are ledged so awfully above the dawn, naked to it.    Fasten the door-windows of the lower veranda. One won't fasten at all.

The springs of American civilization, unlike those of the elder world,  lie revealed in the clear light of History. In appearance they are  feeble; in reality, copious and full of force. Acting at the sources of  life, instruments otherwise weak become mighty for good and evil, and  men, lost elsewhere in the crowd, stand forth as agents of Destiny. In  their toils, their sufferings, their conflicts, momentous questions  were at stake, and issues vital to the future world,--the prevalence  of races, the triumph of principles, health or disease, a blessing or  a curse. On the obscure strife where men died by tens or by scores hung  questions of as deep import for posterity as on those mighty contests of  national adolescence where carnage is reckoned by thousands.    The subject to which the proposed series will be devoted is that of  \"France in the New World,\"--the attempt of Feudalism, Monarchy, and Rome  to master a continent where, at this hour, half a million of bayonets  are vindicating the ascendency of a regulated freedom;--Feudalism  still strong in life, though enveloped and overborne by new-born  Centralization; Monarchy in the flush of triumphant power; Rome, nerved  by disaster, springing with renewed vitality from ashes and corruption,  and ranging the earth to reconquer abroad what she had lost at home.  These banded powers, pushing into the wilderness their indomitable  soldiers and devoted priests, unveiled the secrets of the barbarous  continent, pierced the forests, traced and mapped out the streams,  planted their emblems, built their forts, and claimed all as their own.  New France was all head. Under king, noble, and Jesuit, the lank, lean  body would not thrive. Even commerce wore the sword, decked itself with  badges of nobility, aspired to forest seigniories and hordes of savage  retainers.    Along the borders of the sea an adverse power was strengthening and  widening, with slow but steadfast growth, full of blood and muscle,--a  body without a head. Each had its strength, each its weakness, each its  own modes of vigorous life: but the one was fruitful, the other barren;  the one instinct with hope, the other darkening with shadows of despair.    By name, local position, and character, one of these communities of  freemen stands forth as the most conspicuous representative of this  antagonism,--Liberty and Absolutism, New England and New France. The one  was the offspring of a triumphant government; the other, of an oppressed  and fugitive people: the one, an unflinching champion of the Roman  Catholic reaction; the other, a vanguard of the Reform. Each followed  its natural laws of growth, and each came to its natural result.  Vitalized by the principles of its foundation, the Puritan commonwealth  grew apace. New England was preeminently the land of material progress.  Here the prize was within every man's reach: patient industry need never  doubt its reward; nay, in defiance of the four Gospels, assiduity in  pursuit of gain was promoted to the rank of a duty, and thrift and  godliness were linked in equivocal wedlock. Politically she was free;  socially she suffered from that subtle and searching oppression which  the dominant opinion of a free community may exercise over the members  who compose it. As a whole, she grew upon the gaze of the world, a  signal example of expansive energy; but she has not been fruitful  in those salient and striking forms of character which often give a  dramatic life to the annals of nations far less prosperous.    We turn to New France, and all is reversed. Here was a bold attempt to  crush under the exactions of a grasping hierarchy, to stifle under  the curbs and trappings of a feudal monarchy, a people compassed by  influences of the wildest freedom,--whose schools were the forest and  the sea, whose trade was an armed barter with savages, and whose daily  life a lesson of lawless independence. But this fierce spirit had its  vent. The story of New France is from the first a story of war: of  war--for so her founders believed--with the adversary of mankind  himself; war with savage tribes and potent forest commonwealths;  war with the encroaching powers of Heresy and of England. Her brave,  unthinking people were stamped with the soldier's virtues and the  soldier's faults; and in their leaders were displayed, on a grand and  novel stage, the energies, aspirations, and passions which belong to  hopes vast and vague, ill-restricted powers, and stations of command.    The growth of New England was a result of the aggregate efforts of a  busy multitude, each in his narrow circle toiling for himself, to gather  competence or wealth. The expansion of New France was the achievement  of a gigantic ambition striving to grasp a continent. It was a vain  attempt. Long and valiantly her chiefs upheld their cause, leading to  battle a vassal population, warlike as themselves. Borne down by numbers  from without, wasted by corruption from within, New France fell at last;  and out of her fall grew revolutions whose influence to this hour is  felt through every nation of the civilized world.    The French dominion is a memory of the past; and when we evoke its  departed shades, they rise upon us from their graves in strange,  romantic guise. Again their ghostly camp-fires seem to burn, and the  fitful light is cast around on lord and vassal and black-robed priest,  mingled with wild forms of savage warriors, knit in close fellowship  on the same stern errand. A boundless vision grows upon us; an untamed  continent; vast wastes of forest verdure; mountains silent in primeval  sleep; river, lake, and glimmering pool; wilderness oceans mingling with  the sky. Such was the domain which France conquered for Civilization.  Plumed helmets gleamed in the shade of its forests, priestly vestments  in its dens and fastnesses of ancient barbarism. Men steeped in antique  learning, pale with the close breath of the cloister, here spent the  noon and evening of their lives, ruled savage hordes with a mild,  parental sway, and stood serene before the direst shapes of death. Men  of courtly nurture, heirs to the polish of a far-reaching ancestry,  here, with their dauntless hardihood, put to shame the boldest sons of  toil.    This memorable but half-forgotten chapter in the book of human life  can be rightly read only by lights numerous and widely scattered. The  earlier period of New France was prolific in a class of publications  which are often of much historic value, but of which many are  exceedingly rare. The writer, however, has at length gained access to  them all. Of the unpublished records of the colonies, the archives of  France are of course the grand deposit; but many documents of important  bearing on the subject are to be found scattered in public and private  libraries, chiefly in France and Canada. The task of collection has  proved abundantly irksome and laborious. It has, however, been greatly  lightened by the action of the governments of New York, Massachusetts,  and Canada, in collecting from Europe copies of documents having more or  less relation to their own history. It has been greatly lightened, too,  by a most kind co-operation, for which the writer owes obligations too  many for recognition at present, but of which he trusts to make fitting  acknowledgment hereafter. Yet he cannot forbear to mention the name of  Mr. John Gilmary Shea of New York, to whose labors this department of  American history has been so deeply indebted, and that of the Hon. Henry  Black of Quebec. Nor can he refrain from expressing his obligation to  the skilful and friendly criticism of Mr. Charles Folsom.    In this, and still more must it be the case in succeeding volumes, the  amount of reading applied to their composition is far greater than the  citations represent, much of it being of a collateral and illustrative  nature. This was essential to a plan whose aim it was, while  scrupulously and rigorously adhering to the truth of facts, to animate  them with the life of the past, and, so far as might be, clothe the  skeleton with flesh. If, at times, it may seem that range has been  allowed to fancy, it is so in appearance only; since the minutest  details of narrative or description rest on authentic documents or on  personal observation.    Faithfulness to the truth of history involves far more than a research,  however patient and scrupulous, into special facts. Such facts may be  detailed with the most minute exactness, and yet the narrative, taken  as a whole, may be unmeaning or untrue. The narrator must seek to imbue  himself with the life and spirit of the time. He must study events in  their bearings near and remote; in the character, habits, and manners of  those who took part in them, he must himself be, as it were, a sharer or  a spectator of the action he describes.    With respect to that special research which, if inadequate, is still in  the most emphatic sense indispensable, it has been the writer's aim to  exhaust the existing material of every subject treated. While it would  be folly to claim success in such an attempt, he has reason to hope  that, so far at least as relates to the present volume, nothing of much  importance has escaped him. With respect to the general preparation just  alluded to, he has long been too fond of his theme to neglect any means  within his reach of making his conception of it distinct and true.    To those who have aided him with information and documents, the  extreme slowness in the progress of the work will naturally have caused  surprise. This slowness was unavoidable. During the past eighteen years,  the state of his health has exacted throughout an extreme caution in  regard to mental application, reducing it at best within narrow and  precarious limits, and often precluding"]]]
