FOX      Information about osteological changes in the groups of reptiles that  gave rise to mammals is preserved in the fossil record, but the  musculature of these reptiles has been lost forever. Nevertheless, a  reasonably accurate picture of the morphology and the spatial  relationships of the muscles of many of these extinct vertebrates can  be inferred by studying the scars or other marks delimiting the origins  and insertions of muscles on the skeletons of the fossils and by  studying the anatomy of Recent genera. A reconstruction built by these  methods is largely speculative, especially when the fossil groups are  far removed in time, kinship and morphology from Recent kinds, and when  distortion, crushing, fragmentation and overzealous preparation have  damaged the surfaces associated with the attachment of muscles. The  frequent inadequacy of such direct evidence can be partially offset by  considering the mechanical demands that groups of muscles must meet to  perform a particular movement of a skeletal member.    Both direct anatomical evidence and inferred functional relations were  used to satisfy the purposes of the study here reported on. The  following account reports the results of my efforts to: 1, reconstruct  the adductor muscles of the mandible in _Captorhinus_ and _Dimetrodon_;  2, reconstruct the external adductors of the mandible in the cynodont  _Thrinaxodon_; and 3, learn the causes of the appearance and continued  expansion of the temporal fenestrae among the reptilian ancestors of  mammals.    The osteology of these three genera is comparatively well-known.  Although each of the genera is somewhat specialized, none seems to have  departed radically from its relatives that comprised the line leading  to mammals.    I thank Prof. Theodore H. Eaton, Jr., for suggesting the study here  reported on, for his perceptive criticisms regarding it, and for his  continued patience throughout my investigation. Financial assistance  was furnished by his National Science Foundation Grant (NSF-G8624) for  which I am also appreciative. I thank Dr. Rainer Zangerl, Chief Curator  of Geology, Chicago Museum of Natural History, for permission to  examine the specimens of _Captorhinus_ and _Dimetrodon_ in that  institution. I am grateful to Mr. Robert F. Clarke, Assistant Professor  of Biology, The Kansas State Teachers College, Emporia, Kansas, for the  opportunity to study his specimens of _Captorhinus_ from Richard's  Spur, Oklahoma. Special acknowledgment is due Mr. Merton C. Bowman for  his able preparation of the illustrations.      Captorhinus    The outlines of the skulls of _Captorhinus_ differ considerably from  those of the skulls of the primitive captorhinomorph _Protorothyris_.  Watson (1954:335, Fig. 9) has shown that in the morphological sequence,  _Protorothyris--Romeria--Captorhinus_, there has been flattening and  rounding of the skull-roof and loss of the primitive \"square-cut\"  appearance in transverse section. The quadrates in _Captorhinus_ are  farther from the midline than in _Protorothyris_, and the adductor  chambers in _Captorhinus_ are considerably wider than they were  primitively. Additionally, the postorbital region of _Captorhinus_ is  relatively longer than that of _Protorothyris_, a specialization that  has increased the length of the chambers within.    In contrast with these dimensional changes there has been little shift  in the pattern of the dermal bones that roof the adductor chambers. The  most conspicuous modification in _Captorhinus_ is the absence of the  tabular. This element in _Protorothyris_ was limited to the occiput and  rested without sutural attachment upon the squamosal (Watson,  1954:338); later loss of the tabular could have had no effect upon the  origins of muscles from inside the skull roof. Changes in pattern that  may have modified the origin of the adductors in _Captorhinus_ were  correlated with the increase in length of the parietals and the  reduction of the supratemporals. Other changes that were related to the  departure from the primitive romeriid condition of the adductors  included the development of a coronoid process, the flattening of the  quadrate-articular joint, and the development of the peculiar dentition  of _Captorhinus_.    The adductor chambers of _Captorhinus_ are large. They are covered  dorsally and laterally by the parietal, squamosal, postfrontal,  postorbital, quadratojugal and jugal bones. The chamber extends  medially to the braincase, but is not limited anteriorly by a bony  wall. The occiput provides the posterior limit. The greater part of the  adductor chambers lies mediad of the mandibles and thus of the  Meckelian fossae; consequently the muscles that arise from the dermal  roof pass downward and outward to their insertion on the mandibular  rami.      _Mandible_    The mandibular rami of _Captorhinus_ are strongly constructed. Each  ramus is slightly convex in lateral outline. Approximately the anterior  half of each ramus lies beneath the tooth-row. This half is roughly  wedge-shaped in its lateral aspect, reaching its greatest height  beneath the short posterior teeth.    The posterior half of each ramus is not directly involved in supporting  the teeth, but is associated with the adductor musculature and the  articulation of the ramus with the quadrate. The ventral margin of this  part of the ramus curves dorsally in a gentle arc that terminates  posteriorly at the base of the retroarticular process. The dorsal  margin in contrast sweeps sharply upward behind the teeth and continues  posteriorly in a long, low, truncated coronoid process.    A prominent coronoid process is not found among the more primitive  members of the suborder, such as _Limnoscelis_, although the mandible  commonly curves upward behind the tooth-row in that genus. This area in  _Limnoscelis_ is overlapped by the cheek when the jaw is fully adducted  (Romer, 1956:494, Fig. 213), thereby foreshadowing the more extreme  condition in _Captorhinus_.    The coronoid process in _Captorhinus_ is not oriented vertically, but  slopes inward toward the midline at approximately 45 degrees,  effectively roofing the Meckelian fossa and limiting its opening to the  median surface of each ramus. When the jaw was adducted, the coronoid  process moved upward and inside the cheek. A space persisted between  the process and the cheek because the process sloped obliquely away  from the cheek and toward the midline of the skull. The external  surface of the process presented an area of attachment for muscles  arising from the apposing internal surface of the cheek.      _Palate_    The palate of _Captorhinus_ is of the generalized rhynchocephalian type  (Romer, 1956:71). In _Captorhinus_ the pterygoids and palatines are  markedly arched and the relatively large pterygoid flange lies almost  entirely below the lower border of the cheek. The lateral edge of the  flange passes obliquely across the anterior lip of the Meckelian fossa  and abuts against the bottom lip of the fossa when the jaw is closed.    The palatines articulate laterally with the maxillary bones by means of  a groove that fits over a maxillary ridge. This presumably allowed the  halves of the palate to move up and down rather freely. The greatest  amplitude of movement was at the midline. Anteroposterior sliding of  the palate seems impossible in view of the firm palatoquadrate and  quadrate-quadratojugal articulations.    The subtemporal fossa is essentially triangular, and its broad end is  bounded anteriorly by the pterygoid flange. The fossa is lateral to  much of the adductor chamber; consequently muscles arising from the  parietals passed ventrolaterally, parallel to the oblique quadrate  ramus of the pterygoid, to their attachment on the mandible.      _Musculature_    These osteological features indicate that the adductor muscles of the  jaw in _Captorhinus_ consisted of two primary masses (Figs. 1, 2, 3).  The first of these, the capitimandibularis, arose from the internal  surface of the cheek and roof of the skull and inserted on the bones of  the lower jaw that form the Meckelian canal and the coronoid process.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. _Captorhinus._ Internal aspect of skull, showing  masseter, medial adductor, and temporal muscles. Unnumbered specimen,  coll. of Robert F. Clarke. Richard's Spur, Oklahoma. x 2.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2. _Captorhinus._ Internal aspect of skull, showing  anterior and posterior pterygoid muscles. Same specimen shown in Fig.  1. x 2.]    The muscle was probably divided into a major medial mass, the temporal,  and a lesser, sheetlike lateral mass, the masseter. The temporal was  the largest of the adductors and arose from the lateral parts of the  parietal, the dorsal parts of the postorbital, the most posterior  extent of the postfrontal, and the upper parts of the squamosal. The  muscle may have been further subdivided, but evidence for subordinate  slips is lacking. The fibers of this mass were nearly vertically  oriented in lateral aspect since the parts of the ramus that are  available for their insertion lie within the anteroposterior extent of  the adductor chamber.

INTRODUCTION    The Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln marks the beginning  of the end of a long chapter in human history. Among the earliest  forms of private property was the ownership of slaves. Slavery as an  institution had persisted throughout the ages, always under protest,  always provoking opposition, insurrection, social and civil war, and  ever bearing within itself the seeds of its own destruction. Among the  historic powers of the world the United States was the last to uphold  slavery, and when, a few years after Lincoln's proclamation, Brazil  emancipated her slaves, property in man as a legally recognized  institution came to an end in all civilized countries.    Emancipation in the United States marked the conclusion of a century of  continuous debate, in which the entire history of western civilization  was traversed. The literature of American slavery is, indeed, a summary  of the literature of the world on the subject. The Bible was made a  standard text-book both for and against slavery. Hebrew and Christian  experiences were exploited in the interest of the contending parties  in this crucial controversy. Churches of the same name and order  were divided among themselves and became half pro-slavery and half  anti-slavery.    Greek experience and Greek literature were likewise drawn into the  controversy. The Greeks themselves had set the example of arguing both  for and against slavery. Their practice and their prevailing teaching,  however, gave support to this institution. They clearly enunciated the  doctrine that there is a natural division among human beings; that some  are born to command and others to obey; that it is natural to some men  to be masters and to others to be slaves; that each of these classes  should fulfill the destiny which nature assigns. The Greeks also  recognized a difference between races and held that some were by  nature fitted to serve as slaves, and others to command as masters. The  defenders of American slavery therefore found among the writings of the  Greeks their chief arguments already stated in classic form.    Though the Romans added little to the theory of the fundamental problem  involved, their history proved rich in practical experience. There were  times, in parts of the Roman Empire, when personal slavery either  did not exist or was limited and insignificant in extent. But the  institution grew with Roman wars and conquests. In rural districts,  slave labor displaced free labor, and in the cities servants multiplied  with the concentration of wealth. The size and character of the  slave population eventually became a perpetual menace to the State.  Insurrections proved formidable, and every slave came to be looked upon  as an enemy to the public. It is generally conceded that the extension  of slavery was a primary cause of the decline and fall of Rome. In  the American controversy, therefore, the lesson to be drawn from Roman  experience was utilized to support the cause of free labor.    After the Middle Ages, in which slavery under the modified form of  feudalism ran its course, there was a reversion to the ancient classical  controversy. The issue became clearly defined in the hands of the  English and French philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries. In place of the time-honored doctrine that the masses of  mankind are by nature subject to the few who are born to rule, the  contradictory dogma that all men are by nature free and equal was  clearly enunciated. According to this later view, it is of the very  nature of spirit, or personality, to be free. All men are endowed with  personal qualities of will and choice and a conscious sense of right and  wrong. To subject these native faculties to an alien force is to make  war upon human nature. Slavery and despotism are, therefore, in their  nature but a species of warfare. They involve the forcing of men to act  in violation of their true selves. The older doctrine makes government  a matter of force. The strong command the weak, or the rich exercise  lordship over the poor. The new doctrine makes of government an  achievement of adult citizens who agree among themselves as to what  is fit and proper for the good of the State and who freely observe the  rules adopted and apply force only to the abnormal, the delinquent, and  the defective.    Between the upholders of these contradictory views of human nature  there always has been and there always must be perpetual warfare. Their  difference is such as to admit of no compromise; no middle ground is  possible. The conflict is indeed irresistible. The chief interest in  the American crusade against slavery arises from its relation to this  general world conflict between liberty and despotism.    The Athenians could be democrats and at the same time could uphold and  defend the institution of slavery. They were committed to the doctrine  that the masses of the people were slaves by nature. By definition,  they made slaves creatures void of will and personality, and they  conveniently ignored them in matters of state. But Americans living in  States founded in the era of the Declaration of Independence could not  be good democrats and at the same time uphold and defend the institution  of slavery, for the Declaration gives the lie to all such assumptions  of human inequality by accepting the cardinal axiom that all men are  created equal and are endowed with certain inalienable rights, among  which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The doctrine  of equality had been developed in Europe without special reference to  questions of distinct race or color. But the terms, which are universal  and as broad as humanity in their denotation, came to be applied to  black men as well as to white men. Massachusetts embodied in her state  constitution in 1780 the words, \"All men are born free and equal,\" and  the courts ruled that these words in the state constitution had the  effect of liberating the slaves and of giving to them the same rights as  other citizens. This is a perfectly logical application of the doctrine  of the Revolution.    The African slave-trade, however, developed earlier than the doctrine  of the Declaration of Independence. Negro slavery had long been an  established institution in all the American colonies. Opposition to the  slave-trade and to slavery was an integral part of the evolution of  the doctrine of equal rights. As the colonists contended for their own  freedom, they became anti-slavery in sentiment. A standard complaint  against British rule was the continued imposition of the slave-trade  upon the colonists against their oft-repeated protest.    In the original draft of the Declaration of Independence, there appeared  the following charges against the King of Great Britain:    \"He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most  sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of distant people  who never offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery in  another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation  thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is  the warfare of the Christian King of Great Britain. Determined to keep  open a market where men should be bought and sold, he has prostituted  his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to  restrain this execrable commerce.\"    Though this clause was omitted from the document as finally adopted,  the evidence is abundant that the language expressed the prevailing  sentiment of the country. To the believer in liberty and equality,  slavery and the slave-trade are instances of war against human nature.  No one attempted to justify slavery or to reconcile it with the  principles of free government. Slavery was accepted as an inheritance  for which others were to blame. Colonists at first blamed Great Britain;  later apologists for slavery blamed New England for her share in the  continuance of the slave-trade.    The fact should be clearly comprehended that the sentiments which led to  the American Revolution, and later to the French Revolution in Europe,  were as broad in their application as the human race itself--that there  were no limitations nor exceptions. These new principles involved  a complete revolution in the previously recognized principles of  government. The French sought to make a master-stroke at immediate  achievement and they incurred counterrevolutions and delays. The  Americans moved in a more moderate and tentative manner towards the  great achievement, but with them also a counter-revolution finally  appeared in the rise of an influential class who, by openly defending  slavery, repudiated the principles upon which the government was  founded.    At first the impression was general, in the South as well as in  the North, that slavery was a temporary institution. The cause of  emancipation was already advocated by the Society of Friends and some  other sects. A majority of the States adopted measures for the gradual  abolition of slavery, but in"]]]
