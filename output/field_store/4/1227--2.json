Well, if you lived in Europe in 1490, and someone told you the earth was  round and moved around the sun--that would have been an \"astounding\"  story.    Or if you lived in 1840, and were told that some day men a thousand  miles apart would be able to talk to each other through a little  wire--or without any wire at all--that would have been another.    Or if, in 1900, they predicted ocean-crossing airplanes and submarines,  world-girdling Zeppelins, sixty-story buildings, radio, metal that can  be made to resist gravity and float in the air--these would have been  other \"astounding\" stories.    To-day, time has gone by, and all these things are commonplace. That is  the only real difference between the astounding and the  commonplace--Time.    To-morrow, more astounding things are going to happen. Your children--or  their children--are going to take a trip to the moon. They will be able  to render themselves invisible--a problem that has already been partly  solved. They will be able to disintegrate their bodies in New York and  reintegrate them in China--and in a matter of seconds.    Astounding? Indeed, yes.    Impossible? Well--television would have been impossible, almost  unthinkable, ten years ago.    Now you will see the kind of magazine that it is our pleasure to offer  you beginning with this, the first number of ASTOUNDING STORIES.    It is a magazine whose stories will anticipate the super-scientific  achievements of To-morrow--whose stories will not only be strictly  accurate in their science but will be vividly, dramatically and  thrillingly told.    Already we have secured stories by some of the finest writers of fantasy  in the world--men such as Ray Cummings, Murray Leinster, Captain S. P.  Meek, Harl Vincent, R. F. Starzl and Victor Rousseau.

It came out of the south, and yet, a hundred miles further back along  the course on which it flew, it could not have proceeded in any  direction except northward. For a hundred miles south lay the south  pole, the goal toward which the Travers Expeditions had been pressing  for the better part of that year.    Not that they could not have reached it sooner. As a matter of fact,  the pole had been crossed and re-crossed, according to the estimate of  Tommy Travers, aviator, and nephew of the old millionaire who stood  fairy uncle to the expedition. But one of the things that was being  sought was the exact site of the pole. Not within a couple of miles or  so, but within the fraction of an inch.    It had something to do with Einstein, and something to do with  terrestrial magnetism, and the variations of the south magnetic pole,  and the reason therefore, and something to do with parallaxes and the  precession of the equinoxes and other things, this search for the pole's  exact location. But all that was principally the affair of the  astronomer of the party. Tommy Travers, who was now evidently on his way  back, didn't give a whoop for Einstein, or any of the rest of the stuff.  He had been enjoying himself after his fashion during a year of  frostbites and hard rations, and he was beginning to anticipate the  delights of the return to Broadway.    Captain Storm, in charge of the expedition, together with the five  others of the advance camp, watched the plane maneuver up to the tents.  She came down neatly on the smooth snow, skidded on her runners like an  expert skater, and came to a stop almost immediately in front of the  marquee.    Tommy Travers leaped out of the enclosed cockpit, which, shut off by  glass from the cabin, was something like the front seat of a limousine.    \"Well, Captain, we followed that break for a hundred miles, and there's  no ground cleft, as you expected,\" he said. \"But Jim Dodd and I picked  up something, and Jim seems to have gone crazy.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Through the windows of the cabin, Jim Dodd, the young archaeologist of  the party, could be seen apparently wrestling with something that looked  like a suit of armor. By the time Captain Storm, Jimmy, and the other  members of the party had reached the cabin door, Dodd had got it open  and flung himself out backward, still hugging what he had found, and  maneuvering so that he managed to fall on his back and sustain its  weight.    \"Say, what the--what--what's that?\" gasped Storm.    Even the least scientific minded of the party gasped in amazement at  what Dodd had. It resembled nothing so much as an enormous beetle. As a  matter of fact, it was an insect, for it had the three sections that  characterize this class, but it was merely the shell of one. Between  four and five feet in height, when Dodd stood it on end, it could now be  seen to consist of the hard exterior substance of some huge, unknown  coleopter.    This substance, which was fully three inches thick over the thorax,  looked as hard as plate armor.    \"What is it?\" gasped Storm again.           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy Travers made answer, for James Dodd was evidently incapable of  speech, more from emotion than from the force with which he had landed  backward in the snow.    \"We found it at the pole, Captain,\" he said. \"At least, pretty near  where the pole ought to be. We ran into a current of warm air or  something. The snow had melted in places, and there were patches of bare  rock. This thing was lying in a hollow among them.\"    \"If I didn't see it before my eyes, I'd think you crazy, Tommy,\" said  Storm with some asperity. \"What is it, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41533"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 6 (of 6) (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                                                       THE                            HISTORY OF PAINTING                                     IN                                   ITALY.
