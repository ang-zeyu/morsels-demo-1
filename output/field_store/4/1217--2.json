CONCLUSION          CHAPTER I    JIMMY MAKES A BET      The main smoking-room of the Strollers' Club had been filling for  the last half-hour, and was now nearly full. In many ways, the  Strollers', though not the most magnificent, is the pleasantest club  in New York. Its ideals are comfort without pomp; and it is given  over after eleven o'clock at night mainly to the Stage. Everybody is  young, clean-shaven, and full of conversation: and the conversation  strikes a purely professional note.    Everybody in the room on this July night had come from the theater.  Most of those present had been acting, but a certain number had been  to the opening performance of the latest better-than-Raffles play.  There had been something of a boom that season in dramas whose  heroes appealed to the public more pleasantly across the footlights  than they might have done in real life. In the play that had opened  to-night, Arthur Mifflin, an exemplary young man off the stage, had  been warmly applauded for a series of actions which, performed  anywhere except in the theater, would certainly have debarred him  from remaining a member of the Strollers' or any other club. In  faultless evening dress, with a debonair smile on his face, he had  broken open a safe, stolen bonds and jewelry to a large amount, and  escaped without a blush of shame via the window. He had foiled a  detective through four acts, and held up a band of pursuers with a  revolver. A large audience had intimated complete approval  throughout.    \"It's a hit all right,\" said somebody through the smoke.    \"These near-'Raffles' plays always are,\" grumbled Willett, who  played bluff fathers in musical comedy. \"A few years ago, they would  have been scared to death of putting on a show with a crook as hero.  Now, it seems to me the public doesn't want anything else. Not that  they know what they DO want,\" he concluded, mournfully.    \"The Belle of Boulogne,\" in which Willett sustained the role of  Cyrus K. Higgs, a Chicago millionaire, was slowly fading away on a  diet of paper, and this possibly prejudiced him.    Raikes, the character actor, changed the subject. If Willett once  got started on the wrongs of the ill-fated \"Belle,\" general  conversation would become impossible. Willett, denouncing the  stupidity of the public, as purely a monologue artiste.    \"I saw Jimmy Pitt at the show,\" said Raikes. Everybody displayed  interest.    \"Jimmy Pitt? When did he come back? I thought he was in Italy.\"    \"He came on the Lusitania, I suppose. She docked this morning.\"    \"Jimmy Pitt?\" said Sutton, of the Majestic Theater. \"How long has he  been away? Last I saw of him was at the opening of 'The Outsider' at  the Astor. That's a couple of months ago.\"    \"He's been traveling in Europe, I believe,\" said Raikes. \"Lucky  beggar to be able to. I wish I could.\"    Sutton knocked the ash off his cigar.    \"I envy Jimmy,\" he said. \"I don't know anyone I'd rather be. He's  got much more money than any man except a professional 'plute' has  any right to. He's as strong as an ox. I shouldn't say he'd ever had  anything worse than measles in his life. He's got no relations. And  he isn't married.\"    Sutton, who had been married three times, spoke with some feeling.    \"He's a good chap, Jimmy,\" said Raikes.    \"Yes,\" said Arthur Mifflin, \"yes, Jimmy is a good chap. I've known  him for years. I was at college with him. He hasn't got my  brilliance of intellect; but he has some wonderfully fine qualities.  For one thing, I should say he had put more deadbeats on their legs  again than half the men in New York put together.\"    \"Well,\" growled Willett, whom the misfortunes of the Belle had  soured, \"what's there in that? It's mighty easy to do the  philanthropist act when you're next door to a millionaire.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mifflin warmly, \"but it's not so easy when you're  getting thirty dollars a week on a newspaper. When Jimmy was a  reporter on the News, there used to be a whole crowd of fellows just  living on him. Not borrowing an occasional dollar, mind you, but  living on him--sleeping on his sofa, and staying to breakfast. It  made me mad. I used to ask him why he stood for it. He said there  was nowhere else for them to go, and he thought he could see them  through all right--which he did, though I don't see how he managed  it on thirty a week.\"    \"If a man's fool enough to be an easy mark--\" began Willett.    \"Oh, cut it out!\" said Raikes. \"We don't want anybody knocking Jimmy  here.\"    \"All the same,\" said Sutton, \"it seems to me that it was mighty  lucky that he came into that money. You can't keep open house for  ever on thirty a week. By the way, Arthur, how was that? I heard it  was his uncle.\"    \"It wasn't his uncle,\" said Mifflin. \"It was by way of being a  romance of sorts, I believe. Fellow who had been in love with  Jimmy's mother years ago went West, made a pile, and left it to Mrs.  Pitt or her children. She had been dead some time when that  happened. Jimmy, of course, hadn't a notion of what was coming to  him, when suddenly he got a solicitor's letter asking him to call.  He rolled round, and found that there was about five hundred  thousand dollars just waiting for him to spend it.\"    Jimmy Pitt had now definitely ousted \"Love, the Cracksman\" as a  topic of conversation. Everybody present knew him. Most of them had  known him in his newspaper days; and, though every man there would  have perished rather than admit it, they were grateful to Jimmy for  being exactly the same to them now that he could sign a check for  half a million as he had been on the old thirty-a-week basis.  Inherited wealth, of course, does not make a young man nobler or  more admirable; but the young man does not always know this.    \"Jimmy's had a queer life,\" said Mifflin. \"He's been pretty much  everything in his time. Did you know he was on the stage before he  took up newspaper-work? Only on the road, I believe. He got tired of  it, and cut it out. That's always been his trouble. He wouldn't  settle down to anything. He studied law at Yale, but he never kept  it up. After he left the stage, he moved all over the States,  without a cent, picking up any odd job he could get. He was a waiter  once for a couple of days, but they fired him for breaking plates.  Then, he got a job in a jeweler's shop. I believe he's a bit of an  expert on jewels. And, another time, he made a hundred dollars by  staying three rounds against Kid Brady when the Kid was touring the  country after he got the championship away from Jimmy Garwin. The  Kid was offering a hundred to anyone who could last three rounds  with him. Jimmy did it on his head. He was the best amateur of his  weight I ever saw. The Kid wanted him to take up scrapping  seriously. But Jimmy wouldn't have stuck to anything long enough in  those days. He's one of the gypsies of the world. He was never  really happy unless he was on the move, and he doesn't seem to have  altered since he came into his money.\"    \"Well, he can afford to keep on the move now,\" said Raikes. \"I wish  I--\"    \"Did you ever hear about Jimmy and--\" Mifflin was beginning, when  the Odyssey of Jimmy Pitt was interrupted by the opening of the door  and the entrance of Ulysses in person.    Jimmy Pitt was a young man of medium height, whose great breadth and  depth of chest made him look shorter than he really was. His jaw was  square, and protruded slightly; and this, combined with a certain  athletic jauntiness of carriage and a pair of piercing brown eyes  very much like those of a bull-terrier, gave him an air of  aggressiveness, which belied his character. He was not aggressive.  He had the good-nature as well as the eyes of a bull-terrier. Also,  he possessed, when stirred, all the bull-terrier's dogged  determination.    There were shouts of welcome.    \"Hullo, Jimmy!\"    \"When did you get back?\"    \"Come and sit down. Plenty of room over here.\"    \"Where is my wandering boy tonight?\"    \"Waiter! What's yours, Jimmy?\"    Jimmy dropped into a seat, and yawned.    \"Well,\" he said, \"how goes it? Hullo, Raikes! Weren't you at 'Love,  the Cracksman'? I thought I saw you. Hullo, Arthur! Congratulate  you. You spoke your piece nicely.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Mifflin. \"We were just talking about you, Jimmy. You  came on the Lusitania, I suppose?\"    \"She didn't break the record this time,\" said Sutton.    A somewhat pensive look came into Jimmy's eyes.    \"She came much too quick for me,\" he said. \"I don't see why they  want to rip along at that pace,\" he went on, hurriedly. \"I like to  have a chance of enjoying the sea-air.\"    \"I know that sea-air,\" murmured Mifflin.    Jimmy looked up quickly.    \"What are you babbling about, Arthur?\"    \"I said nothing,\" replied Mifflin, suavely.    \"What did you think of the show tonight, Jimmy?\" asked Raikes.    \"I liked it. Arthur was fine. I can't make out, though, why all this  incense is being burned at the feet of the cracksman. To judge by  some of the plays they produce now, you'd think"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40780"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#1)"],[1,"(C) 2004, 2012 by S.

Its  purpose is also to look at history through its laws, which do not lend  themselves to interpretation, and thus points of view, as does  conventional history; one cannot argue with the black letter of the  law. Attorneys will be interested in reading about the historical  context in which the legal doctrines they learned in law school  developed. This book includes the complete law codes of King Alfred and  of King Aethelbert, the law code of King Canute, paraphrased, excerpts  from the law code of Henry I, the entire Magna Carta, and the statutes  of England relevant to English life, but excluding such topics as  Scottish affairs and wars with Ireland. It also includes the inception  of the common law system, which was praised because it made law which  was not handed down by an absolutist king; the origin of the jury  system; the meaning of the Magna Carta provisions in their historical  context; and the emergence of attorneys.          This book is a primer. One may read it without prior knowledge  of history or law, although it will be more meaningful to attorneys  than to others. It can serve as an introduction on which to base  further reading in English legal history. It defines terms unique to  English legal history. However, the meaning of some terms in King  Aethelbert's code in Chapter 1 are unknown or inexact.          In the Table of Contents, the title of each chapter denotes an  important legal development in the given time period for that chapter.  Each chapter is divided into three sections: The Times, The Law, and  Judicial Procedure.          The Times section sets a background and context in which to  better understand the law of that period. The usual subject matter of  history such as battles, wars, royal intrigues, periods of corruption,  and international relations are omitted as not helping to understand  the process of civilization and development of the law. Standard  practices are described, but there are often variations with locality.  Also, change did not come abruptly, but with vacillations, e.g. the  change from pagan to Christian belief and the change to allowance of  loans for interest. The scientific revolution was accepted only slowly.  There were often many attempts made for change before it actually  occurred, e.g. gaining Parliamentary power over the king's privileges,  such as taxation.          The Law section describes the law governing the behavior and  conduct of the populace. It includes law of that time which is the  same, similar, or a building block to the law of today. In earlier  times this is both statutory law and the common law of the courts. The  Magna Carta, which is quoted in Chapter 7, is the first statute of  England and is listed first in the \"Statutes of the Realm\" and the  \"Statutes at Large\". The law sections of Chapters 7 - 18 mainly quote  or paraphrase almost all of these statutes. Excluded are statutes which  do not help us understand the development of our law, such as statutes  governing Wales after its conquest and statutes on succession rights to  the throne.          The Judicial Procedure section describes the process of  applying the law and trying cases, and jurisdictions. It also contains  some examples of cases.          Money is expressed in pounds, shillings, pence, scaetts, or  marks, which is a Danish denomination. There are twenty shillings in a  pound. A mark in silver is two-thirds of a pound. Shillings are  abbreviated: \"s.\" The pre-Norman English shilling was divided into 4  pence or pennies. In Henry I's time, the shilling was divided into 5  pence. The Norman shilling was introduced by Henry II and was divided  into 12 pennies. This penny was literally one pennyweight of silver, so  a pound sterling thus weighed 240 pennyweights. Pence are abbreviated  \"d.\", for the Roman denarius. For example, six shillings and two pence  is denoted 6s.2d. A scaett was a coin of silver and copper of lesser  denomination; there were 20 scaetts to one shilling. There were no  coins of the denomination of shilling during pre-Norman times.                 Dedication and Acknowledgements            A Vassar College faculty member once dedicated her book to her  students, but for whom it would have been written much earlier.

The settlement of England goes back thousands of years. At  first, people hunted and gathered their food. They wore animal skins  over their bodies for warmth and around their feet for protection when  walking. These skins were sewn together with bone needles and threads  made from animal sinews. They carried small items by hooking them onto  their belts. They used bone and stone tools, e.g. for preparing skins.  Their uncombed hair was held by thistlethorns, animal spines, or  straight bone hair pins. They wore conical hats of bound rush and lived  in rush shelters.            Early clans, headed by kings, lived in huts on top of hills or  other high places and fortified by circular or contour earth ditches  and banks behind which they could gather for protection. They were  probably dug with antler picks and wood spades. The people lived in  rectangular huts with four wood posts supporting a roof. The walls were  made of saplings, and a mixture of mud and straw. Cooking was in a clay  oven inside or over an open fire on the outside. Water was carried in  animal skins or leather pouches from springs lower on the hill up to  the settlement. Forests abounded with wolves, bears, deer, wild boars,  and wild cattle. They could more easily be seen from the hill tops.  Pathways extended through this camp of huts and for many miles beyond.            For wives, men married women of their clan or bought or  captured other women, perhaps with the help of a best man. They carried  their unwilling wives over the thresholds of their huts, which were  sometimes in places kept secret from her family. The first month of  marriage was called the honeymoon because the couple was given mead, a  drink with fermented honey and herbs, for the first month of their  marriage. A wife wore a gold wedding band on the ring finger of her  left hand to show that she was married.            Women usually stayed at home caring for children, preparing  meals, and making baskets. They also made wool felt and spun and wove  wool into a coarse cloth. Flax was grown and woven into a coarse linen  cloth. Spinning the strands into one continuous thread was done on a  stick, which the woman could carry about and spin at anytime when her  hands were free. The weaving was done on an upright or warp-weighted  loom. People of means draped the cloth around their bodies and fastened  it with a metal brooch inlayed with gold, gems, and shell, which were  glued on with glue that was obtained from melting animal hooves. People  drank from hollowed- out animal horns, which they could carry from  belts. They could tie things with rawhide strips or rope braids they  made. Kings drank from animal horns decorated with gold or from cups of  amber, shale, or pure gold. Men and women wore pendants and necklaces  of colorful stones, shells, amber beads, bones, and deer teeth. They  skinned and cut animals with hand-axes and knives made of flint dug up  from pits and formed by hitting flakes off. The speared fish with  barbed bone prongs or wrapped bait around a flint, bone, or shell fish  hook. On the coast, they made bone harpoons for deep-sea fish. The  flint ax was used to shape wood and bone and was just strong enough to  fell a tree, although the process was very slow.            The king, who was tall and strong, led his men in hunting"]]]
