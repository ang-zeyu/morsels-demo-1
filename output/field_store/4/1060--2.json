It is a story      which will make the heart of many readers leap with joy._        _We have rarely printed a story in this magazine that for scientific      interest, as well as suspense, could hold its own with this      particular story. We prophesy that this story will become more      valuable as the years go by. It certainly holds a number of      interesting prophecies, of which no doubt, many will come true. For      wealth of science, it will be hard to beat for some time to come. It      is one of those rare stories that will bear reading and re-reading      many times._        _This story has impressed us so favorably, that we hope the author      may be induced to write a sequel to it soon._          Foreword      Elsewhere I have set down, for whatever interest they have in this, the  25th Century, my personal recollections of the 20th Century.    Now it occurs to me that my memoirs of the 25th Century may have an  equal interest 500 years from now--particularly in view of that unique  perspective from which I have seen the 25th Century, entering it as I  did, in one leap across a gap of 492 years.    This statement requires elucidation. There are still many in the world  who are not familiar with my unique experience. Five centuries from now  there may be many more, especially if civilization is fated to endure  any worse convulsions than those which have occurred between 1975 A.D.  and the present time.    I should state therefore, that I, Anthony Rogers, am, so far as I know,  the only man alive whose normal span of eighty-one years of life has  been spread over a period of 573 years. To be precise, I lived the first  twenty-nine years of my life between 1898 and 1927; the other fifty-two  since 2419. The gap between these two, a period of nearly five hundred  years, I spent in a state of suspended animation, free from the ravages  of katabolic processes, and without any apparent effect on my physical  or mental faculties.    When I began my long sleep, man had just begun his real conquest of the  air in a sudden series of transoceanic flights in airplanes driven by  internal combustion motors. He had barely begun to speculate on the  possibilities of harnessing sub-atomic forces, and had made no further  practical penetration into the field of ethereal pulsations than the  primitive radio and television of that day. The United States of America  was the most powerful nation in the world, its political, financial,  industrial and scientific influence being supreme; and in the arts also  it was rapidly climbing into leadership.    I awoke to find the America I knew a total wreck--to find Americans a  hunted race in their own land, hiding in the dense forests that covered  the shattered and leveled ruins of their once magnificent cities,  desperately preserving, and struggling to develop in their secret  retreats, the remnants of their culture and science--and the undying  flame of their sturdy independence.    World domination was in the hands of Mongolians and the center of world  power lay in inland China, with Americans one of the few races of  mankind unsubdued--and it must be admitted in fairness to the truth, not  worth the trouble of subduing in the eyes of the Han Airlords who ruled  North America as titular tributaries of the Most Magnificent.    For they needed not the forests in which the Americans lived, nor the  resources of the vast territories these forests covered. With the  perfection to which they had reduced the synthetic production of  necessities and luxuries, their remarkable development of scientific  processes and mechanical accomplishment of work, they had no economic  need for the forests, and no economic desire for the enslaved labor of  an unruly race.    They had all they needed for their magnificently luxurious and degraded  scheme of civilization, within the walls of the fifteen cities of  sparkling glass they had flung skyward on the sites of ancient American  centers, into the bowels of the earth underneath them, and with  relatively small surrounding areas of agriculture.    Complete domination of the air rendered communication between these  centers a matter of ease and safety. Occasional destructive raids on the  waste lands were considered all that was necessary to keep the \"wild\"  Americans on the run within the shelter of their forests, and prevent  their becoming a menace to the Han civilization.    But nearly three hundred years of easily maintained security, the last  century of which had been nearly sterile in scientific, social and  economic progress, had softened and devitalized the Hans.    It had likewise developed, beneath the protecting foliage of the forest,  the growth of a vigorous new American civilization, remarkable in the  mobility and flexibility of its organization, in its conquest of almost  insuperable obstacles, in the development and guarding of its industrial  and scientific resources, all in anticipation of that \"Day of Hope\" to  which it had been looking forward for generations, when it would be  strong enough to burst from the green chrysalis of the forests, soar  into the upper air lanes and destroy the yellow incubus.    At the time I awoke, the \"Day of Hope\" was almost at hand. I shall not  attempt to set forth a detailed history of the Second War of  Independence, for that has been recorded already by better historians  than I am. Instead I shall confine myself largely to the part I was  fortunate enough to play in this struggle and in the events leading up  to it.    [Illustration: Seen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as  though it were being fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day, while  the explosions of the rockets appeared as flashes of extra brilliance.]    It all resulted from my interest in radioactive gases. During the latter  part of 1927 my company, the American Radioactive Gas Corporation, had  been keeping me busy investigating reports of unusual phenomena observed  in certain abandoned coal mines near the Wyoming Valley, in  Pennsylvania.    With two assistants and a complete equipment of scientific instruments,  I began the exploration of a deserted working in a mountainous district,  where several weeks before, a number of mining engineers had reported  traces of carnotite[1] and what they believed to be radioactive gases.  Their report was not without foundation, it was apparent from the  outset, for in our examination of the upper levels of the mine, our  instruments indicated a vigorous radioactivity.        [1] A hydrovanadate of uranium, and other metals; used as a source      of radium compounds.    On the morning of December 15th, we descended to one of the lowest  levels. To our surprise, we found no water there. Obviously it had  drained off through some break in the strata. We noticed too that the  rock in the side walls of the shaft was soft, evidently due to the  radioactivity, and pieces crumbled under foot rather easily. We made our  way cautiously down the shaft, when suddenly the rotted timbers above us  gave way.    I jumped ahead, barely escaping the avalanche of coal and soft rock, but  my companions, who were several paces behind me, were buried under it,  and undoubtedly met instant death.    I was trapped. Return was impossible. With my electric torch I explored  the shaft to its end, but could find no other way out. The air became  increasingly difficult to breathe, probably from the rapid accumulation  of the radioactive gas. In a little while my senses reeled and I lost  consciousness.    When I awoke, there was a cool and refreshing circulation of air in the  shaft. I had no thought that I had been unconscious more than a few  hours, although it seems that the radioactive gas had kept me in a state  of suspended animation for something like 500 years. My awakening, I  figured out later, had been due to some shifting of the strata which  reopened the shaft and cleared the atmosphere in the working. This must  have been the case, for I was able to struggle back up the shaft over a  pile of debris, and stagger up the long incline to the mouth of the  mine, where an entirely different world, overgrown with a vast forest  and no visible sign of human habitation, met my eyes.    I shall pass over the days of mental agony that followed in my attempt  to grasp the meaning of it all. There were times when I felt that I was  on the verge of insanity. I roamed the unfamiliar forest like a lost  soul. Had it not been for the necessity of improvising traps and crude  clubs with which to slay my food, I believe I should have gone mad.    Suffice it to say, however, that I survived this psychic crisis. I shall  begin my narrative proper with my first contact with Americans of the  year 2419 A.D.          CHAPTER I    Floating Men      My first glimpse of a human being of the 25th Century was obtained  through a portion of woodland where the trees were thinly scattered,  with a dense forest beyond.    I had been wandering along aimlessly, and hopelessly, musing over my  strange fate, when I noticed a figure that cautiously backed out of the  dense growth across the glade. I was about to call out joyfully, but  there was something furtive about the figure that prevented me. The  boy's attention (for it seemed to be a lad of fifteen or sixteen) was  centered tensely on the heavy growth of trees from which he had just  emerged.    He was clad in rather tight-fitting garments entirely of green, and wore  a helmet-like cap of the same color. High around his waist he wore a  broad, thick belt, which bulked up in the back across the shoulders,  into something of the proportions of a knapsack.    As I was taking in these details, there came a vivid flash and heavy  detonation, like that of a hand grenade, not far to the left of him. He  threw up an arm and staggered a bit "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#1)"],[1,"from the 1908 Longmans, Green, and Co. edition by David  Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org            NEWS FROM NOWHERE  OR  AN EPOCH OF REST  BEING SOME CHAPTERS FROM  A UTOPIAN ROMANCE      BY  WILLIAM MORRIS,  AUTHOR OF 'THE EARTHLY PARADISE.'    _TENTH IMPRESSION_    LONGMANS, GREEN, AND CO.  39 PATERNOSTER ROW, LONDON  NEW YORK, BOMBAY, AND CALCUTTA  1908    _All rights reserved_    _First printed serially in the_ Commonweal, 1890.    _Thence reprinted at Boston_, _Mass._, 1890.    _First English Edition_, _revised_, _Reeves & Turner_, 1891.    _Reprinted April_, _June_ 1891; _March_ 1892.    _Kelmscott Press Edition_, 1892.    _Since reprinted March_ 1895; _January_ 1897; _November_ 1899; _August_  1902; _July_ 1905; _January_ 1907; _and January_ 1908.          CHAPTER I: DISCUSSION AND BED      Up at the League, says a friend, there had been one night a brisk  conversational discussion, as to what would happen on the Morrow of the  Revolution, finally shading off into a vigorous statement by various  friends of their views on the future of the fully-developed new society.    Says our friend: Considering the subject, the discussion was  good-tempered; for those present being used to public meetings and after-  lecture debates, if they did not listen to each others' opinions (which  could scarcely be expected of them), at all events did not always attempt  to speak all together, as is the custom of people in ordinary polite  society when conversing on a subject which interests them.  For the rest,  there were six persons present, and consequently six sections of the  party were represented, four of which had strong but divergent Anarchist  opinions.  One of the sections, says our friend, a man whom he knows very  well indeed, sat almost silent at the beginning of the discussion, but at  last got drawn into it, and finished by roaring out very loud, and  damning all the rest for fools; after which befel a period of noise, and  then a lull, during which the aforesaid section, having said good-night  very amicably, took his way home by himself to a western suburb, using  the means of travelling which civilisation has forced upon us like a  habit.  As he sat in that vapour-bath of hurried and discontented  humanity, a carriage of the underground railway, he, like others, stewed  discontentedly, while in self-reproachful mood he turned over the many  excellent and conclusive arguments which, though they lay at his fingers'  ends, he had forgotten in the just past discussion.  But this frame of  mind he was so used to, that it didn't last him long, and after a brief  discomfort, caused by disgust with himself for having lost his temper  (which he was also well used to), he found himself musing on the subject-  matter of discussion, but still discontentedly and unhappily.  \"If I  could but see a day of it,\" he said to himself; \"if I could but see it!\"    As he formed the words, the train stopped at his station, five minutes'  walk from his own house, which stood on the banks of the Thames, a little  way above an ugly suspension bridge.  He went out of the station, still  discontented and unhappy, muttering \"If I could but see it! if I could  but see it!\" but had not gone many steps towards the river before (says  our friend who tells the story) all that discontent and trouble seemed to  slip off him.    It was a beautiful night of early winter, the air just sharp enough to be  refreshing after the hot room and the stinking railway carriage.  The  wind, which had lately turned a point or two north of west, had blown the  sky clear of all cloud save a light fleck or two which went swiftly down  the heavens.  There was a young moon halfway up the sky, and as the home-  farer caught sight of it, tangled in the branches of a tall old elm, he  could scarce bring to his mind the shabby London suburb where he was, and  he felt as if he were in a pleasant country place--pleasanter, indeed,  than the deep country was as he had known it.    He came right down to the river-side, and lingered a little, looking over  the low wall to note the moonlit river, near upon high water, go swirling  and glittering up to Chiswick Eyot: as for the ugly bridge below, he did  not notice it or think of it, except when for a moment (says our friend)  it struck him that he missed the row of lights down stream.  Then he  turned to his house door and let himself in; and even as he shut the door  to, disappeared all remembrance of that brilliant logic and foresight  which had so illuminated the recent discussion; and of the discussion  itself there remained no trace, save a vague hope, that was now become a  pleasure, for days of peace and rest, and cleanness and smiling goodwill.    In this mood he tumbled into bed, and fell asleep after his wont, in two  minutes' time; but (contrary to his wont) woke up again not long after in  that curiously wide-awake condition which sometimes surprises even good  sleepers; a condition under which we feel all our wits preternaturally  sharpened, while all the miserable muddles we have ever got into, all the  disgraces and losses of our lives, will insist on thrusting themselves  forward for the consideration of those sharpened wits.    In this state he lay (says our friend) till he had almost begun to enjoy  it: till the tale of his stupidities amused him, and the entanglements  before him, which he saw so clearly, began to shape themselves into an  amusing story for him.    He heard one o'clock strike, then two and then three; after which he fell  asleep again.  Our friend says that from that sleep he awoke once more,  and afterwards went through such surprising adventures that he thinks  that they should be told to our comrades, and indeed the public in  general, and therefore proposes to tell them now.  But, says he, I think  it would be better if I told them in the first person, as if it were  myself who had gone through them; which, indeed, will be the easier and  more natural to me, since I understand the feelings and desires of the  comrade of whom I am telling better than any one else in the world does.          CHAPTER II: A MORNING BATH      Well, I awoke, and found that I had kicked my bedclothes off; and no  wonder, for it was hot and the sun shining brightly.  I jumped up and  washed and hurried on my clothes, but in a hazy and half-awake condition,  as if I had slept for a long, long while, and could not shake off the  weight of slumber.  In fact, I rather took it for granted that I was at  home in my own room than saw that it was so.    When I was dressed, I felt the place so hot that I made haste to get out  of the room and out of the house; and my first feeling was a delicious  relief caused by the fresh air and pleasant breeze; my second, as I began  to gather my wits together, mere measureless wonder: for it was winter  when I went to bed the last night, and now, by witness of the river-side  trees, it was summer, a beautiful bright morning seemingly of early June.  However, there was still the Thames sparkling under the sun, and near  high water, as last night I had seen it gleaming under the moon.    I had by no means shaken off the feeling of oppression, and wherever I  might have been should scarce have been quite conscious of the place; so  it was no wonder that I felt rather puzzled in despite of the familiar  face of the Thames.  Withal I felt dizzy and queer; and remembering that  people often got a boat and had a swim in mid-stream, I thought I would  do no less.  It seems very early, quoth I to myself, but I daresay I  shall find someone at Biffin's to take me.  However, I didn't get as far  as Biffin's, or even turn to my left thitherward, because just then I  began to see that there was a landing-stage right before me in front of  my house: in fact, on the place where my next-door neighbour had rigged  one up, though somehow it didn't look like that either.  Down I went on  to it, and sure enough among the empty boats moored to it lay a man on  his sculls in a solid-looking tub of a boat clearly meant for bathers.  He  nodded to me, and bade me good-morning as if he expected me, so I jumped  in without any words, and he paddled away quietly as I peeled for my  swim.  As we went, I looked down on the water, and couldn't help saying--    \"How clear the water is this morning!\"    \"Is it?\" said he; \"I didn't notice it.  You know the flood-tide always  thickens it a bit.\"    \"H'm,\" said I, \"I have seen it pretty muddy even at half-ebb.\"    He said nothing in answer, but seemed rather astonished; and as he now  lay just stemming the tide, and I had my clothes off, I jumped in without  more ado.  Of course when I had my head above water again I turned  towards the tide, and my eyes naturally sought for the bridge, and so  utterly astonished was I by what I saw, that I forgot to strike out, and  went spluttering under water again, and when I came up made straight for  the boat; for I felt that I must ask some questions of my waterman, so  bewildering had been the half-sight I had seen from the face of the river  with the water hardly out of my eyes; though by this time I was quit of  the slumbrous and dizzy feeling, and was wide-awake and clear-headed.    As I got in up the steps which he had lowered, and he held out his hand  to help me, we went drifting speedily up towards Chiswick; but now he  caught up the sculls and brought her head round again, and said--\"A short  swim, neighbour; but perhaps you find the water cold this morning, after  your journey.  Shall I put you ashore at once, or would you like to go  down to Putney before breakfast?\"    He spoke in a way so unlike what I should have expected from a  Hammersmith waterman, that I stared at him, as I answered, \"Please to  hold her a little; I want to look about me a bit.\"    \"All right,\" he said; \"it's no less pretty in its way here than it is off  Barn Elms; it's jolly everywhere this time in the morning.
