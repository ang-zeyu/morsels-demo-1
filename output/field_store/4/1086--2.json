A slice of roast meat was his only dish. Wine he did not  even touch; the bottle remained unopened before him. He must keep  himself calm. He drank two cups of thick, black coffee, and lighted an  enormous cigar, sitting with his elbows on the table and his chin in his  hands, looking with dreamy eyes at the guests who one by one filled the  dining-room.    It was a number of years ago, not long after he had been given \"the  alternative\" in the bull-ring of Madrid, that he came to lodge at a  certain hotel on Alcala Street where his hosts treated him as if he were  one of the family, and the dining-room servants, porters, scullions, and  old waiters adored him as the glory of the establishment. There, too, he  had spent many days wrapped in bandages, in a dense atmosphere heavy  with the smell of iodoform, in consequence of two gorings, but the  unhappy recollection did not weigh upon him.    In his Southern superstitious mind, exposed to continual danger, he  regarded this hotel as a charmed shelter, and thought that nothing ill  would happen to him while living in it; accidents common to the  profession, rents in his clothing, scratches in his flesh perhaps, but  no last and final fall after the manner of other comrades, the  recollection of whom haunted even his happier hours.    On the days of the great bull-fights, after the early breakfast, he  enjoyed sitting in the dining-room contemplating the movement of  travellers. They were foreigners, or people from distant provinces, who  passed near with indifferent countenances, and without looking at him;  and then became curious on learning from the servants that the fine  youth with shaven face and black eyes, dressed like a young gentleman,  was Juan Gallardo, by all familiarly called Gallardo, the famous  bull-fighter. Thus were whiled away the long and painful hours before  going to the plaza.    These moments of uncertainty, in which vague fears emerged from the  depths of his soul, making him doubt himself, were the bitterest in his  professional experience. He would not go out on the street thinking of  the strain of the contest, and of the need of keeping himself rested and  agile; and he could not entertain himself at the table on account of the  necessity of eating a light meal, in order to reach the ring without  disturbance of his digestion.    He remained at the head of the table, his face between his hands and a  cloud of perfumed smoke before his eyes, turning his gaze from time to  time with a certain fatuousness to look at some ladies who were  contemplating the famous bull-fighter with interest.    His pride as the idol of the masses made him feel that he could divine  eulogy and flattery in these looks. They thought him smart and elegant.  And, with the instinct of all men accustomed to pose before the public,  forgetting his preoccupation, he sat erect, knocked off with his finger  nails the cigar ashes fallen on his sleeves, and arranged his ring,  which covered the whole joint of one of his fingers with an enormous  diamond surrounded by a nimbus of colors as if its clear liquid depths  burned with magic fire.    His eyes roved with satisfaction over his person, admiring the suit of  elegant cut, the cap which he wore around the hotel lying on a nearby  chair, the fine gold chain that crossed the upper part of his vest from  pocket to pocket, the pearl in his cravat that seemed to illuminate the  brown tone of his countenance with milky light, and the shoes of Russia  leather showing between their tops and the edge of the rolled-up  trousers socks of open-work silk embroidered like the stockings of a  cocotte.    An atmosphere of English perfumes, mild and vague, but used with  profusion, arose from his clothing and from his black and brilliant  hair. This he brushed carefully down over his temples, adopting a style  certain to attract feminine curiosity. For a bull-fighter the ensemble  was not bad; he felt satisfied with his appearance. Where was there  another more distinguished, or one who had a better way with women?    But suddenly his preoccupation returned, the brilliancy of his eyes  clouded, and he rested his chin in his hands again, puffing at his cigar  tenaciously, his gaze lost in the cloud of smoke. He thought wistfully  of the hour of nightfall, wishing it already here; of the return from  the bull-ring, sweaty and tired, but with the joy of danger conquered,  the appetites awakened, a mad desire for sport, and the certainty of a  few days of safety and rest.    If God would protect him as heretofore he was going to feast with the  appetite of his days of poverty and starvation, get a little drunk, and  go in search of a certain girl who sang in a music-hall, whom he had  seen on his last trip without having a chance to cultivate her  acquaintance. Leading this life of continual change from one end of the  Peninsula to the other he did not have time for much in the way of  pleasure.    Enthusiastic friends who wished to see the swordsman before going to  breakfast at their homes began entering the dining-room. They were old  admirers anxious to figure in a _banderia_ and to have an idol; they had  made the young Gallardo the _matador_ of their choice, and they gave him  sage counsel, frequently recalling their old-time adoration for  Lagartijo or Frascuelo.    In addressing Gallardo they called him _thou_, with gracious  familiarity, while he put _don_ before their names with the traditional  class distinction that still exists between the bull-fighter risen from  the social subsoil and his admirers. These men linked their enthusiasm  with memories of the past to make the young _matador_ feel their  superiority of years and experience. They talked of the old plaza of  Madrid where only bulls that _were_ bulls and bull-fighters that _were_  bull-fighters were recognized. Coming down to the present, they trembled  with emotion on mentioning the Negro, Frascuelo.    \"If thou hadst seen him! But thou and those of thy time were at the  breast then, or were not even born.\"    Other enthusiasts began entering the dining-room, poorly clad and  hungry-looking; obscure newspaper reporters; and men of problematical  profession who appeared as soon as the news of Gallardo's arrival was  circulated, besieging him with praises and petitions for tickets. Common  enthusiasm jostled them against great merchants or public functionaries,  who discussed bull-fighting affairs with them warmly, regardless of  their beggarly aspect.    All, on seeing the swordsman, embraced him or shook his hand with an  accompaniment of questions and exclamations.    \"Juanillo--how goes it with Carmen?\"    \"Well, thanks.\"    \"And how is your mother, Senora Angustias?\"    \"Fine, thanks. She's at La Rincona'.\"    \"And your sister and your little nephews?\"    \"As usual, thanks.\"    \"And that good-for-nothing brother-in-law of yours, how is he?\"    \"He's all right--as much of a gabbler as ever.\"    \"Are there any additions to the family? Any expectations?\"    \"No--not even that.\"    He made a fingernail crackle between his teeth with a strong negative  expression and then began returning the questions to the new arrivals,  of whose life he knew nothing beyond their inclination for the art of  bull-fighting.    \"And how is your family--all right? Well, glad to hear it. Sit down and  have something.\"    Then he inquired about the condition of the bulls that were to be fought  within a few hours, for all these friends had come from the plaza and  from seeing the separation and penning in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net.

R. Harding.]]          INTRODUCTION.      Ever since Columbus discovered America, furs have been an important  article of commerce, but at the rate of the catch during recent years,  the supply drawn from the natural sources--forest, field and  stream--will soon prove inadequate if not entirely depleted in some  species.    Less than 30 years ago, there were countless thousands of Buffalo upon  the Western Plains. Where are they today? In the 70's and early 80's  they were slain by tens of thousands by hide and robe hunters. Does or  does not such a condition face some of the American fur bearing animals  at the present time? Many hunters and trappers must think that the  supply will not long be equal to the demand, judging from the hundreds  of letters written the Editor of HUNTER-TRADER-TRAPPER, asking  information about raising fur bearing animals.    This work has been hastily gotten out to meet this demand, yet the  sources of information from which the work has been gathered, are  authentic. Much of the habits, nature, etc., of the various animals has  been furnished by Mr. E. Kreps, a trapper of wide experience. Facts have  also been furnished by those that have to a certain extent followed \"Fur  Farming\" and as well some information has been added from the United  States Government Bulletins.    A. R. HARDING.    Columbus, Ohio, April 1, 1909.          FUR FARMING.          CHAPTER 1.    SUPPLY AND DEMAND.      For years there has been a belief that the supply of fur-bearing animals  would soon be inadequate to the demand. This belief is well founded and  is apparent when the fact is known that the natural haunts and homes of  the fur-producing animals are becoming less each year. The draining of  swamps and marshes is destroying the homes and breeding places of  muskrat and to a certain extent coon and mink. The saw mill and clearing  of the land is rapidly lessening the natural resorts of coon, bear, wild  cat and opossum in the South and Central States, while in the North,  marten, fisher and lynx are being deprived of their natural homes.    Beaver and otter do not like civilization and leave on signs of man and  his works. This is especially true of beaver; otter linger in waters  fringed with timber longer even if settled.    Some animals, it is true, do well in fairly thickly-settled sections.  Among animals of this kind are red fox, skunk, mink and muskrat. Yet no  fur bearer can hold its numbers against the ever-increasing number of  trappers and the persistency with which they now seek the fur producers.    North America furnishes a large per cent. of the furs of the  world--foxes, mink, otter, beaver, skunk, marten, lynx, coon, opossum,  muskrat, wolves, etc. Considerable quantities of fine furs are still  secured in parts of Russia, in Europe and Siberia in Asia; Australia  furnishes great quantities of opossum, while from parts of South  America, the trade in chinchilla is large. Yet North America has been  for centuries, the great fur-producing continent and now that trapping  is being pressed harder than ever and the natural haunts of the animals  are becoming less each year, the question is,--where will the future  supply come from?    In this connection the following article on The Fur Markets is  reproduced from the April issue of _The Hunter-Trader-Trapper_:    The Spring or March London Sales began March 22 and ended April 2.  During that time American Raw Furs were offered by Hudson's Bay Company;  C. M. Lampson & Co., and A. & W. Nesbitt. In face of the fact that  prices on some articles have advanced so materially that American  manufacturers have bought sparingly, the outcome of the sales was  awaited with much interest by the trade.    A year ago in giving the quantity of goods offered by the Hudson's Bay  Company, this magazine said: \"The quantity seems to be decreasing as the  offering this year is less than 1907, and 1907 less than 1906.\" The  offerings this year are still less than 1908, and for ready comparison  the Hudson's Bay Company offerings at the March Sales for three years  are given:                              1909    1908   1907      Otter                  5,341   4,968   6,933    Fisher                 2,671   3,224   3,228    Cross Fox              1,445   2,678   4,490    Red Fox                2,987   6,598  10,200    Silver Fox               344     526     896    Blue Fox                  14      63      88    White Fox              2,058   6,703  11,409    Marten                21,577  29,808  43,798    Mink                  10,966  13,091  32,817    Ermine                15,314  14,280  20,737    Lynx                   8,856  31,892  56,611    Wolf                   3,756   4,207   2,771    Wolverine                718     865     734    Skunk                  1,478   5,023  11,430    Bear, Black            3,943   3,740   4,042    Bear, Brown              387     353     432    Bear, Grey               108     123      94    Bear, White               89      59     137    Badger                   125     169     322    Raccoon                  140     243     600    The combined offerings of C.
