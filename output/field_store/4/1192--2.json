They occur from Nicaragua in Central America into the  southwestern United States. The principal part of the geographic range  of the pygmy mice lies in the Republic of Mexico. They are notably  common in central Mexico, but are only locally common to the north and  to the south, and then only in certain seasons.    Pygmy mice were first brought to the attention of biologists in 1887  when Oldfield Thomas described a diminutive species of cricetine rodent,  _Hesperomys_ (_Vesperimus_) _taylori_. The description was based on a  specimen obtained by William Taylor from San Diego, Duval County, Texas.  C. Hart Merriam (1892:70) described _Sitomys musculus_ on the basis of  specimens from Colima [City of], Colima, Mexico. Merriam (_loc. cit._)  mentioned that the two kinds of mice, _Hesperomys taylori_ and _Sitomys  musculus_, \"in general appearance look almost precisely like the common  house mouse (_Mus musculus_) but are still smaller and have shorter  tails.\" He placed the two species in the genus _Sitomys_. Frederick W.  True in 1894 regarded them as composing a distinct subgenus of _Sitomys,  Baiomys_. According to True (1894:758), _S. taylori_ and _S. musculus_  possessed a different combination of characters (ascending ramus of  mandible short and erect, condyle terminal, coronoid process  well-developed, uncinate, and near the condyle, size small, tail short,  plantar tubercles six, soles hairy) than either _Vesperimus_, or  _Onychomys_ (which had been considered as a subgenus of _Hesperomys_  until 1889). In 1907, E. A. Mearns accorded _Baiomys_ generic rank.  Osgood (1909:252) treated _Baiomys_ us a subgenus of _Peromyscus_,  whereas, Miller, in 1912, regarded _Baiomys_ as a distinct genus. Most  recent students of North American mammals have followed Miller, but  usually with reservations. Ellerman (1941:402) emphasized that the  taxonomic position of the genus was uncertain, and wrote that _Baiomys_  \"... seems to be considerably distinct from _Peromyscus_, and may  perhaps be a northern representative of _Hesperomys_ or one of the small  South American genera.\"    Only two comprehensive analyses of geographic variation and  interspecific taxonomic relationships have been made; the first was by  Osgood (1909) who had fewer than a fourth of the specimens of _Baiomys_  available to me; the second was by Hooper (1952a:90-97) who contributed  importantly to understanding the relationships of the two living species  in central Mexico. No attempts heretofore have been made to correlate  and understand the relationships of the five fossil species to one  another and to the living species assigned to the genus.    Six objectives of the following report are to: (1) list characters  taxonomically useful in recognizing species and subspecies; (2) record  amount of variation within and between populations; (3) correlate  observed variations with known biological principles; (4) show  geographic ranges of the two living species; (5) indicate relationships  between fossil and living species of the genus; and (6) clarify the  systematic position of the genus.          MATERIALS, METHODS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS      This report is based on the study of approximately 3,520 museum study  skins, skulls, complete skeletons, and entire animals preserved in  liquid. Most specimens examined were accompanied by an attached label  bearing data on locality and date of capture, name of collector,  external measurements, and sex. In addition, 49 fossil specimens  referable to _Baiomys_ were studied. Nearly two-thirds of the specimens  were assembled at the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History;  the remainder were examined in other institutions.    Specimens studied were grouped by geographic origin, sex, age, and  season of capture. Individual variation was then measured in several of  the larger samples of each living species and in measurable fossil  material. External measurements used were those recorded by the  collectors on the labels attached to the skins. Twenty cranial  measurements employed in the past in the study of _Baiomys_ and closely  related cricetine rodents were statistically analyzed. The coefficient  of variation was calculated for each of the 20 measurements in order to  determine which varied least. In general, measurements having the least  coefficient of variation were used in comparing samples from different  geographic areas. Figure 1 shows the points between which measurements  were taken.    _Occipitonasal length._--From anteriormost projection of nasal bones to  posteriormost projection of supraoccipital bone. _A_ to _A'_    _Zygomatic breadth._--Greatest distance across zygomatic arches of  cranium at right angles to long axis of skull. _B_ to _B'_    _Postpalatal length._--From posterior margin of hard palate to anterior  margin of foramen magnum. _C_ to _C'_    _Least interorbital breadth._--Least distance across top of skull  between orbits. _D_ to _D'_    _Length of incisive foramina._--From anteriormost point to posteriormost  point of incisive foramina. _E_ to _E'_    _Length of rostrum._--The distance in a straight line from the notch  that lies lateral to the lacrimal to the tip of the nasal on the same  side. _F_ to _F'_"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38308"],[0,"Natural History of Cottonmouth Moccasin, Agkistrodon piscovorus (Reptilia) (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's Note.

Twenty-five live cottonmouths were kept in the laboratory for the  purpose of studying behavior and fang shedding and for comparison of  measurements with those of preserved specimens. Live snakes were  obtained in Brazoria and Nacogdoches counties, Texas, from Hermann Park  Zoo, Houston, Texas, and from the late Paul Anderson of Independence,  Missouri. Preserved western cottonmouths were examined for the purpose  of determining variation, distribution, food habits, body proportions,  embryonic development, and reproductive cycles. The cottonmouths  examined include: 221 from Texas; 33 from Arkansas; 22 from Louisiana; 2  from Illinois; and 1 each from Kansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma.    In the preparation of this report I have examined all available  literature pertaining to the cottonmouth and have drawn from these  sources for comparative or additional material. Some of the more  noteworthy contributions to knowledge of the cottonmouth are the general  accounts of the life history by Allen and Swindell (1948), Barbour  (1956), and Wright and Wright (1957); the publications by Gloyd and  Conant (1943) concerning taxonomy; Klimstra (1959) concerning food  habits; and Allen (1937), Parrish and Pollard (1959), Swanson (1946),  and Wolff and Githens (1939b) concerning the venom. Numerous other  publications, although brief, contain worthwhile contributions. Also of  special interest as a source of material for comparison of cottonmouths  with other crotalids are the works of Fitch (1960) on the copperhead and  of Klauber (1956) on the rattlesnakes.    The cottonmouth has been well known for nearly 200 years. Wright and  Wright (1957) listed the following vernacular names that are applied to  the cottonmouth: black moccasin, black snake, blunt-tail moccasin,  congo, copperhead, cottonmouth water moccasin, cotton-mouthed snake,  gapper, highland moccasin, lowland moccasin, mangrove rattler, moccasin,  North American cottonmouth snake, North American water moccasin, North  American water viper, pilot, rusty moccasin, salt-water rattler,  stubtail, stump (-tail) moccasin, stump-tail viper, swamp lion, Texas  Moccasin, trapjaw, Troost's moccasin, true horn snake, true water  moccasin, viper, water mokeson, water pilot, water rattlesnake, and  water viper.    Some of the names listed above are based upon superstition and folklore  prevailing in pioneer times, and others are based upon the behavior or  appearance of the snake at various ages. Names like \"stump-tail  moccasin\" are derived from the appearance of females which have short  tails or snakes that have lost part of the tail. Names like \"gapper\" and  \"trapjaw\" came to be applied because of the habit of the snake's lying  with its mouth open when approached. The name \"cottonmouth\" also was  derived from this behavior, although the lining of the mouth is whitish  in most other snakes. The term \"rattlesnake\" may have come from the fact  that the cottonmouth vibrates its tail vigorously when nervous as do  many other snakes, or it may have been confused with rattlesnakes.  Because of the general public's fear of snakes and their reluctance to  learn to discriminate between the poisonous and harmless species,  numerous kinds of snakes seen in or near water have been called  moccasins. The general appearance, pugnacious behavior, and whitish  mouth of water-snakes (_Natrix_) have earned them a bad reputation. In  fact, a great majority of the \"cottonmouths\" reported in many areas are  found to be water-snakes.    The cottonmouth is economically important mainly because of the  injurious or fatal effects of its bite and the psychological effect that  its actual or suspected presence has upon many persons. The species eats  a wide variety of prey items and helps to prevent overabundance of  certain kinds of organisms. The venom has been used in the therapeutic  treatment of blood clots owing to its anticoagulant properties  (Didisheim and Lewis, 1956). It also is employed in the treatment of  haemorrhagic conditions and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as in the  production of antivenin (Allen and Swindell, _op cit._:13). None of  these uses of venom has become widely accepted, and its value is  questionable.
