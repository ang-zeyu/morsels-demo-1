Most ornithologists agree that  some of the passerine families of current classifications are  artificial groups. These artificial groupings are the result of early  work which gave chief attention to readily adaptive external  structures. The size and shape of the bill, for example, have been  over-emphasized in the past as taxonomic characters. It is now  recognized that the bill is a highly adaptive structure and that it  frequently shows convergence and parallelism.    Since studies of external morphology have failed in some cases to  provide a clear understanding of the relationships of passerine birds,  it seems appropriate that attention be given to other morphological  features, to physiological features, and to life history studies in an  attempt to find other clues to relationships at the family and  subfamily levels.    This paper reports the results of a study of the relationships of some  birds of the Family Fringillidae and is based on the comparative  myology of the pelvic appendage and on the comparative serology of  saline-soluble proteins. Where necessary for comparative purposes,  birds from other families have been included in these investigations.    It has long been recognized that the Fringillidae include dissimilar  groups. Recent work by Beecher (1951b, 1953) on the musculature of the  jaw and by Tordoff (1954) primarily on the structure of the bony  palate has emphasized the artificial nature of the assemblage although  these authors disagree regarding major divisions within it (see  below).    The Fringillidae have been distinguished from other families of  nine-primaried oscines by only one character--a heavy and conical bill  (for crushing seeds). Bills of this form have been developed  independently in several other, unrelated, groups; as Tordoff (1954:7)  has pointed out, _Molothrus_ of the Family Icteridae, _Psittorostra_  of the Family Drepaniidae, and most members of the Family Ploceidae  have bills as heavy and conical as those of the fringillids. The  ploceids are distinguished from the fringillids by a single external  character: a fairly well-developed tenth primary whereas in  fringillids the tenth primary is absent or vestigial. Tordoff  (1954:20) points out, however, that this distinction is of limited  value since in other passerine families the tenth primary may be  present in some species of a genus and absent in others. The Genus  _Vireo_ is an example. Furthermore, at least one ploceid  (_Philetairus_) has a small, vestigial tenth primary, whereas some  fringillids (_Emberizoides_, for example) possess a tenth primary  which is rather large and ventrally placed (Chapin, 1917:253-254).  Thus, it is obvious that studies based on other features are necessary  in order to attain a better understanding of the relationships of the  birds involved.    Sushkin's studies (1924, 1925) of the structure of the bony and horny  palates have served as a basis for the division of the Fringillidae  into as many as five subfamilies (Hellmayr, 1938:v): Richmondeninae,  Geospizinae, Fringillinae, Carduelinae, and Emberizinae.    Beecher (1951b:280) points out that \"the richmondenine finches arise  so uninterruptedly out of the tanagers that ornithologists have had  to draw the dividing line between the two groups arbitrarily.\" His  study of pattern of jaw-musculature substantiates this. He states  further that the cardueline finches arise without disjunction  from the tanagers. He suggests, therefore, that the two groups of  \"tanager-finches\" be made subfamilies of the Thraupidae and that a  third subfamily be maintained for the more typical tanagers. He states  that the emberizine finches are of different origin, arising from the  wood warblers (1953:307). Beecher (1951a:431; 1953:309) includes the  Dickcissel, _Spiza americana_, in the Family Icteridae, chiefly on the  basis of jaw muscle-pattern and the horny palate.    Tordoff (1954:10-11) presents evidence that the occurrence of  palato-maxillary bones in nine-primaried birds indicates relationship  among the forms possessing them. He points out that all fringillids  except the Carduelinae possess palato-maxillaries that are either free  or more or less fused to the prepalatine bar. He points out also that  in all carduelines, the prepalatine bar is flared at its juncture with  the premaxilla, and that the mediopalatine processes are fused across  the midline; noncardueline fringillids lack these characteristics. In  addition to the above he cites differences between the carduelines and  the \"other\" fringillids in the appendicular skeletons, in geographic  distribution, in patterns of migration, and in habits. Tordoff  concludes, therefore, that the carduelines are not fringillids but  ploceids, their closest affinities being with the ploceid Subfamily  Estrildinae. On the basis of palatal structure, the Fringillinae and  Geospizinae are combined with the Emberizinae, the name Fringillinae  being maintained for the subfamily. The tanagers merge with the  Richmondeninae on the one hand and with the Fringillinae on the other.  On this basis, Tordoff (1954:32) suggests that the Family Fringillidae  be divided into subfamilies as follows: Richmondeninae, Thraupinae,  and Fringillinae. The carduelines are placed as the Subfamily  Carduelinae in the Family Ploceidae.    From the foregoing, it is apparent that the two most recent lines of  research have given rise to conflicting theories regarding  relationships within the Family Fringillidae. The purpose of my  investigation, therefore, has been to gather information, from other  fields, which might clarify the relationships of these birds.    Since the muscle pattern of the leg in the Order Passeriformes is  thought to be one of long standing and slow change, any variation  which consistently distinguishes one group of species from another  could be significant. With the hope that such variation might be  found, a study of the comparative myology of the legs was undertaken.    The usefulness of comparative serology as a means of determining  relationship has been demonstrated in many investigations. Its use in  this instance was undertaken for several reasons: comparative serology  has its basis in biochemical systems which seem to evolve slowly; its  methods are objective; and its use has, heretofore, resulted in the  accumulation of data which seem compatible, in most instances, with  data obtained from other sources.    I acknowledge with pleasure the guidance received in this study from  Prof. Harrison B. Tordoff of the University of Kansas. I am indebted  also to Prof. Charles A. Leone without whose direction and assistance  the serological investigations would not have been possible; to  Professors E. Raymond Hall and A. Byron Leonard whose suggestions and  criticisms have been most helpful in the preparation of this paper;  and to T. D. Burleigh of the U. S.

BAKER          INTRODUCTION      Mammals from along the Alaska Highway were obtained for the University  of Kansas Museum of Natural History in the summers of 1947 and 1948 by  Mr. J. R. Alcorn, field representative of the Museum. He and his  family visited Alberta, British Columbia, the Yukon Territory and  Alaska in an automobile and trailer from June 9, 1947, to September 6,  1947, and again from June 8, 1948, to August 24, 1948. In 1947,  considerable time was spent by Alcorn in Alaska; trips were made on  the Steese Highway to Circle and on the Glenn Highway to Anchorage. In  1948, most of the collecting was done in British Columbia and in the  Yukon Territory but a side trip was taken to Haines, Alaska. The  collecting stations are shown in figure 1. Alcorn's 1,252 specimens  include several large series from areas where few or no mammals had  been taken previously. Time spent at each collecting station was of  short duration (usually less than three days) and although 56 species  and subspecies of mammals are represented in the collections, it is  recognized that not all of the kinds of mammals at any one locality  were taken.    For the loan of comparative mammalian material, grateful  acknowledgment is made to officials of the following institutions:  California Academy of Sciences; Biological Surveys collection of the  U. S. National Museum; Provincial Museum, Victoria, B. C.; National  Museum of Canada. The promptness of officials of the game commissions  of the provinces and territories concerned, in providing permits for  collecting also is acknowledged. A part of the funds for field work  was made available by a grant from the Kansas University Endowment  Association. Elevations above sea level are given in feet.

These animals show definite  evidence of intergradation with the larger subspecies, _S. c.  streatori_, but are referable to _S. c. cinereus_. The pallor of some  shrews from east-central Alaska (Chatanika River and Salcha River)  suggests intergradation with the pale _S. c. hollisteri_.    Alcorn found the cinereous shrew at most of his trapping stations. It  was captured in mouse traps baited with \"chewed\" rolled oats; one was  taken in a trap baited with a grasshopper. Rand (1944:35) and Alcorn  each found this shrew to be one of the commoner mammals along the  Alaska Highway, but Alcorn did not find it to be so abundant as some  of the rodents in areas in which he trapped. The cinereous shrew was  taken principally in moist woodlands, grassy areas, and adjacent to  water. One female taken on July 18 was lactating.

S Haines, 5 ft.,  9.    _Remarks._--Average and extreme external measurements of the nine  adult specimens from 1 mile south of Haines are as follows: Total  length, 103 (98-105); tail, 45 (43-46); and condylobasal length, 16.2  (16.0-16.4). Corresponding measurements of an adult specimen (No.  1676, UKMNH) from Sitka, Alaska, are 108, 47, and 16.5. Measurements  of ten adult specimens from the Chilkat River, 9 miles west and 4  miles north of Haines, are 100 (91-106), 44 (40-50), 16.0 (15.5-16.5).  The slightly smaller average size of the latter specimens indicates a  trend toward the smaller _S. c. cinereus_, which occurs farther  inland. Skulls of some of the specimens from the Chilkat River have a  more slender rostrum than those of the specimens from 1 mile south of  Haines, and more nearly resemble _S. c. cinereus_ in this respect.  Evidently, as indicated by Jackson (1928:54), _S. c. streatori_  occupies only an extremely narrow strip of mainland in the vicinity of  Haines."]]]
