A NEW NATION         BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE          THE AMERICAN SPIRIT IN LITERATURE        CHAPTER I. THE PIONEERS    The United States of America has been from the beginning in a perpetual  change. The physical and mental restlessness of the American and the  temporary nature of many of his arrangements are largely due to the  experimental character of the exploration and development of this  continent. The new energies released by the settlement of the colonies  were indeed guided by stern determination, wise forethought, and  inventive skill; but no one has ever really known the outcome of the  experiment. It is a story of faith, of       Effort, and expectation, and desire,     And something evermore about to be.    An Alexander Hamilton may urge with passionate force the adoption of the  Constitution, without any firm conviction as to its permanence. The most  clear-sighted American of the Civil War period recognized this element  of uncertainty in our American adventure when he declared: \"We are  now testing whether this nation, or any nation so conceived and so  dedicated, can long endure.\" More than fifty years have passed since  that war rearmed the binding force of the Constitution and apparently  sealed the perpetuity of the Union. Yet the gigantic economic and social  changes now in progress are serving to show that the United States has  its full share of the anxieties which beset all human institutions in  this daily altering world.    \"We are but strangers in an inn, but passengers in a ship,\" said Roger  Williams. This sense of the transiency of human effort, the perishable  nature of human institutions, was quick in the consciousness of the  gentleman adventurers and sober Puritan citizens who emigrated from  England to the New World. It had been a familiar note in the poetry of  that Elizabethan period which had followed with such breathless interest  the exploration of America. It was a conception which could be shared  alike by a saint like John Cotton or a soldier of fortune like John  Smith. Men are tent-dwellers. Today they settle here, and tomorrow they  have struck camp and are gone. We are strangers and sojourners, as all  our fathers were.    This instinct of the camper has stamped itself upon American life and  thought. Venturesomeness, physical and moral daring, resourcefulness  in emergencies, indifference to negligible details, wastefulness  of materials, boundless hope and confidence in the morrow, are  characteristics of the American. It is scarcely an exaggeration to  say that the \"good American\" has been he who has most resembled a good  camper. He has had robust health--unless or until he has abused it,--a  tolerant disposition, and an ability to apply his fingers or his brain  to many unrelated and unexpected tasks. He is disposed to blaze his own  trail. He has a touch of prodigality, and, withal, a knack of keeping  his tent or his affairs in better order than they seem. Above all, he  has been ever ready to break camp when he feels the impulse to wander.  He likes to be \"foot-loose.\" If he does not build his roads as solidly  as the Roman roads were built, nor his houses like the English houses,  it is because he feels that he is here today and gone tomorrow. If he  has squandered the physical resources of his neighborhood, cutting the  forests recklessly, exhausting the soil, surrendering water power and  minerals into a few far-clutching fingers, he has done it because he  expects, like Voltaire's Signor Pococurante, \"to have a new garden  tomorrow, built on a nobler plan.\" When New York State grew too crowded  for Cooper's Leather-Stocking, he shouldered his pack, whistled to his  dog, glanced at the sun, and struck a bee-line for the Mississippi.  Nothing could be more typical of the first three hundred years of  American history.    The traits of the pioneer have thus been the characteristic traits of  the American in action. The memories of successive generations have  tended to stress these qualities to the neglect of others. Everyone  who has enjoyed the free life of the woods will confess that his own  judgment upon his casual summer associates turns, quite naturally and  almost exclusively, upon their characteristics as woodsmen. Out of the  woods, these gentlemen may be more or less admirable divines, pedants,  men of affairs; but the verdict of their companions in the forest is  based chiefly upon the single question of their adaptability to the  environment of the camp. Are they quick of eye and foot, skillful with  rod and gun, cheerful on rainy days, ready to do a little more than  their share of drudgery? If so, memory holds them.    Some such unconscious selection as this has been at work in the  classification of our representative men. The building of the nation and  the literary expression of its purpose and ideals are tasks which have  called forth the strength of a great variety of individuals. Some of  these men have proved to be peculiarly fitted for a specific service,  irrespective of the question of their general intellectual powers, or  their rank as judged by the standard of European performance in the same  field. Thus the battle of New Orleans, in European eyes a mere bit of  frontier fighting, made Andrew Jackson a \"hero\" as indubitably as if he  had defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. It gave him the Presidency.    The analogy holds in literature. Certain expressions of American  sentiment or conviction have served to summarize or to clarify the  spirit of the nation. The authors of these productions have frequently  won the recognition and affection of their contemporaries by means of  prose and verse quite unsuited to sustain the test of severe critical  standards. Neither Longfellow's \"Excelsior\" nor Poe's \"Bells\" nor  Whittier's \"Maud Muller\" is among the best poems of the three writers  in question, yet there was something in each of these productions which  caught the fancy of a whole American generation. It expressed one phase  of the national mind in a given historical period.    The historian of literature is bound to take account of this question of  literary vogue, as it is highly significant of the temper of successive  generations in any country. But it is of peculiar interest to the  student of the literature produced in the United States. Is this  literature \"American,\" or is it \"English literature in America,\" as  Professor Wendell and other scholars have preferred to call it? I should  be one of the last to minimize the enormous influence of England upon  the mind and the writing of all the English-speaking countries of  the globe. Yet it will be one of the purposes of the present book to  indicate the existence here, even in colonial times, of a point of  view differing from that of the mother country, and destined to differ  increasingly with the lapse of time. Since the formation of our Federal  Union, in particular, the books produced in the United States have  tended to exhibit certain characteristics which differentiate them from  the books produced in other English speaking countries. We must beware,  of course, of what the late Charles Francis Adams once called the  \"filiopietistic\" fallacy. The \"American\" qualities of our literature  must be judged in connection with its conformity to universal standards  of excellence. Tested by any universal standard, \"The Scarlet Letter\"  is a notable romance. It has won a secure place among the literature  written by men of English blood and speech. Yet to overlook the  peculiarly local or provincial characteristics of this remarkable story  is to miss the secret of its inspiration. It could have been written  only by a New Englander, in the atmosphere of a certain epoch.    Our task, then, in this rapid review of the chief interpreters of  the American spirit in literature, is a twofold one. We are primarily  concerned with a procession of men, each of whom is interesting as an  individual and as a writer. But we cannot watch the individuals long  without perceiving the general direction of their march, the ideas that  animate them, the common hopes and loyalties that make up the life  of their spirit. To become aware of these general tendencies is to  understand the \"American\" note in our national writing.    Our historians have taught us that the history of the United States  is an evolution towards political unity. The separatist, particularist  movements are gradually thrust to one side. In literary history,  likewise, we best remember those authors who fall into line with what  we now perceive to have been the course of our literary development.  The erratic men and women, the \"sports\" of the great experiment,  are ultimately neglected by the critics, unless, like the leaders of  political insurrections, those writing men and women have raised a  notable standard of revolt. No doubt the apparently unique literary  specimens, if clearly understood in their origins and surroundings,  would be found rooted in the general laws of literary evolution. But  these laws are not easy to codify and we must avoid the temptation to  discover, in any particular period, more of unity than there actually  was. And we must always remember that there will be beautiful prose and  verse unrelated to the main national tendencies save as \"the literature  of escape.\" We owe this lesson to the genius of Edgar Allan Poe.    Let us test these principles by applying them to the earliest colonists.

By ALE[vS] HRDLI[vC]KA.      The first to describe a case of division of the parietal bone in apes  was Johannes Ranke, in 1899.[1] The skull in question is that of an  adolescent female orang, one of 245 orang crania in the Selenka  collection in the Munich Anthropological Institute. The abnormal  suture divides the right parietal into an upper larger and a lower  smaller portion. \"The suture runs nearly parallel with the sagittal  suture,\" but, as the illustration shows (Fig. 1), it descends in its  posterior extremity towards the temporo-parietal suture, and  terminates in this a few millimetres in front of the lambdoid suture.  The abnormal suture shows but little serration, and the articulation  of the two divisions of the parietal bone is squamous in character,  the lower portion overlapping the upper. Below the junction of the  abnormal with the coronal suture, the latter takes a pronounced bend  forward. A similar bend in the coronal suture is present in the same  specimen on the left side. This is common among the other orang skulls  in the collection. The portions of the coronal suture below and above  the bend differ somewhat in character.    Besides the above-mentioned complete division, Ranke found among the  245 orang skulls 13 with incomplete division of the parietal bone. The  division consisted invariably of a longer or shorter remnant of a  horizontal \"parietal suture,\" ending in the coronal suture at the top  of the bend above referred to. A similar anterior remnant of an  abnormal parietal suture was found by Ranke in a young chimpanzee  skull; but the author questions the word \"chimpanzee,\" which evidently  means that the identity of the skull is somewhat doubtful.    In consequence of his finds, Ranke believes both complete and  incomplete divisions in the parietal bone to be much more frequent in  the orang than in man.[2] He also thinks that the bend usually present  in the coronal suture in the orang signifies that, \"even where there  are no traces of a parietal suture, such a suture has actually existed  in an earlier stage of development.\" This implies the development of  the adult parietal bone in the orang from two original segments, one  above the other.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Division of the Right Parietal in an Orang  (Ranke, Abh. d. k. bayer. Akad. d. Wiss., II cl., XX Bd., ii Abth.).]    The divisions which I am about to describe occur, one in each  parietal, in the skull of a nine-year-old male chimpanzee, which was  captured, when young, in West Africa. Later on he was one of the  attractions of the Barnum and Bailey Circus, and was familiarly known  as Chico. The chimpanzee died in 1894, since when his skin and bones  have been preserved in the American Museum of Natural History, New  York City. Prof. J. A. Allen, the curator of the Zoological Department  of the Museum, has kindly given me permission to describe the skeletal  parts for publication.[3]    The most interesting part of Chico is unquestionably the skull. The  divisions of the parietal bones which the specimen presents are not  only the first complete divisions of the parietal observed in a  chimpanzee, but are also unique in character, no divisions of the same  nature having been observed before, either in man, in apes, or in  monkeys. The position and extent of the divisions in this skull will  throw considerable light on the question of the aberrant, complete  divisions of the parietal bone, by which term may be designated  divisions differing from the typical horizontal ones.    The skull under consideration shows in general a good development and  an almost perfect symmetry. The capacity of the brain cavity, measured  according to Flower's method, is 390 c.c.    The masculine features of this skull, and particularly the temporal  ridges, are not quite as marked as those of another skull of an  adolescent male chimpanzee in the Museum. The temporal ridges are  slightly prominent, and in their middle third, over part of the frontal  and the parietal bones, not more pronounced than in some human crania.  They are, however, situated very high. Their upper lines or boundaries  touch each other over a part of the sagittal suture, a little back of  the bregma; while the lower lines approach to within 6 mm. of the  sagittal suture. The supraorbital ridges are not very massive, although  prominent to such a degree that, when the skull rests on the occipital  condyles and on the teeth, the plane of the orbits is almost vertical.  The sagittal crest is insignificant; the occipital crest is high, but  not very massive. The zygomatic arches are less strong than they are in  an average white male; and the mastoids are small, even smaller than in  an average adult white female.    The second dentition is incomplete; the third molars have not reached  the level of the opening of their sockets. The condition of the  sutures, so far as their patency is concerned, does not bear the same  relation to the stage of dentition as it does in man: all the sutures  of this skull are more or less obliterated. There are no signs on any  part of the skull that point to the closure of any of the sutures as  premature. In detail, the condition of the sutures is as follows: The  spheno-maxillary articulation is completely closed, but still plainly  traceable. Of the various facial sutures, only remnants are open; the  suture in the zygomatic arch, however, is almost fully patent on both  sides. The spheno-frontal articulation is completely obliterated on  the left, but traces of it remain on the right side. The left  temporo-sphenoidal and squamo-frontal sutures (the squama of the  temporal articulates with the frontal bone) are, with the exception of  the basal part of the former, which remains open, quite obliterated,  but on the right side both are open. The temporo-parietal sutures,  with the exception of 8 mm. of the anterior end of the suture on the  right side, are both entirely closed and hardly traceable. The coronal  suture is partly open on the left, and wholly open on the right, up to  a point a little below the middle of the anterior border of the  parietal bone. At this point on each side, the lower portion of the  coronal suture bends backward and continues as the anomalous suture;  the upper portion of the coronal, particularly on the right, is  completely obliterated, though still traceable. There are no signs  left of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures, and only the basal portions  of the temporo-occipital articulation remain. The palatine sutures,  also, are entirely obliterated.    The skull shows no important anomalies besides the division of the  parietals.    The divisions of the parietal bones begin on the left 32 mm., on the  right 28 mm. (measured with a tape), above the point of junction of  the coronal and temporo-parietal sutures. From the point where the  anomalous sutures leave the coronal suture, to the bregma, the  distance on the left is 44 mm., on the right 42 mm. The excess of size  of the left over the right parietal bone along the coronal suture (6  mm.) compensates the greater height of that portion of the right  temporal squama which articulates with the frontal bone. Measured  across their middle from the temporo-parietal suture, the two  parietals appear to be almost of equal size (left 82 mm., right 80  mm.). In an antero-posterior direction, from the beginning of the  division to the middle of the parietal portion of the occipital crest,  both bones measure the same, namely 75 mm.    The division in the left parietal begins at a V-shaped cleft, which is  filled with a process of the frontal bone. There are slightly distinct  markings on the bone and a number of insular ossicles, which make it  probable that the cleft had been originally much greater and was  largely filled by a Wormian or, rather, a fontanel bone, the lower  border of which has subsequently united with the parietal.    For 30 mm. from its beginning the abnormal suture proceeds directly  backward, and to this extent shows but little obliteration. The original  cleft has, it seems, extended up to this point. From here the suture  takes a slight bend upwards, and proceeds almost directly upwards and  backwards, becoming gradually obliterated, until it disappears at the  temporal ridge, 16 mm. from the median line. Originally the suture must  have terminated on the posterior border of the parietal bone, not far  from the lambda. The whole suture shows fairly good serration. The  coronal suture on this side, below the division, shows serration about  equal to that of the abnormal suture; the obliterated portion above this  was, so far as can be seen, more simple.    [Illustration: Figs. 2-4. Skull of an Adolescent Male Chimpanzee.]    On the right side the division of the parietal may also have begun with  a cleft in the anterior border of the bone, but, owing to the advanced  state of obliteration of the upper portion of the coronal suture on this  side, the existence of the cleft cannot be fully ascertained. Here also  the abnormal suture, at first wholly open, runs for the first 26 mm.  directly backwards; at this point the suture, still quite patent, takes  a turn somewhat sharper than that on the left, and proceeds for 16 mm.  backwards and upwards; here it takes a second turn, and proceeds almost  directly upwards towards"]]]
