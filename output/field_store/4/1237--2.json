Shove the spark lever  over, and turn on more gasolene! We'll make a record this trip.\"    Two lads in the tonneau of a touring car, that was whirling along a  country road, leaned forward to speak to the one at the steering  wheel. The latter was a red-haired youth, with somewhat squinty  eyes, and not a very pleasant face, but his companions seemed to  regard him with much favor. Perhaps it was because they were riding  in his automobile.    \"Whoop her up, Andy!\" added the lad on the seat beside the driver.  \"This is immense!\"    \"I rather thought you'd like it,\" remarked Andy Foger, as he turned  the car to avoid a stone in the road. \"I'll make things hum around  Shopton!\"    \"You have made them hum already, Andy,\" commented the lad beside  him. \"My ears are ringing. Wow! There goes my cap!\"    As the boy spoke, the breeze, created by the speed at which the car  was traveling, lifted off his cap, and sent it whirling to the rear.    Andy Foger turned for an instant's glance behind. Then he opened the  throttle still wider, and exclaimed:    \"Let it go, Sam. We can get another. I want to see what time I can  make to Mansburg! I want to break a record, if I can.\"    \"Look out, or you'll break something else!\" cried a lad on the rear  seat. \"There's a fellow on a bicycle just ahead of us. Take care,  Andy!\"    \"Let him look out for himself,\" retorted Foger, as he bent lower  over the steering wheel, for the car was now going at a terrific  rate. The youth on the bicycle was riding slowly along, and did not  see the approaching automobile until it was nearly upon him. Then,  with a mean grin, Andy Foger pressed the rubber bulb of the horn  with sudden energy, sending out a series of alarming blasts.    \"It's Tom Swift!\" cried Sam Snedecker. \"Look out, or you'll run him  down!\"    \"Let him keep out of my way,\" retorted Andy savagely.    The youth on the wheel, with a sudden spurt of speed, tried to cross  the highway. He did manage to do it, but by such a narrow margin  that in very terror Andy Foger shut off the power, jammed down the  brakes and steered to one side. So suddenly was he obliged to swerve  over that the ponderous machine skidded and went into the ditch at  the side of the road, where it brought up, tilting to one side.    Tom Swift, his face rather pale from his narrow escape, leaped from  his bicycle, and stood regarding the automobile. As for the  occupants of that machine, from Andy Foger, the owner, to the three  cronies who were riding with him, they all looked very much  astonished.    \"Are we--is it damaged any, Andy?\" asked Sam Snedecker.    \"I hope not,\" growled Andy. \"If my car's hurt it's Tom Swift's  fault!\"    He leaped from his seat and made a hurried inspection of the  machine. He found nothing the matter, though it was more from good  luck than good management. Then Andy turned and looked savagely at  Tom Swift. The latter, standing his wheel up against the fence,  walked forward.    \"What do you mean by getting in the way like that?\" demanded Andy  with a scowl. \"Don't you see that you nearly upset me?\"    \"Well, I like your nerve, Andy Foger!\" cried Tom. \"What do you mean  by nearly running me down? Why didn't you sound your horn? You  automobilists take too much for granted! You were going faster than  the legal rate, anyhow!\"    \"I was, eh?\" sneered Andy.    \"Yes, you were, and you know it. I'm the one to make a kick, not  you. You came pretty near hitting me. Me getting in your way! I  guess I've got some rights on the road!\"    \"Aw, go on!\" growled Andy, for he could think of nothing else to  say. \"Bicycles are a back number, anyhow.\"    \"It isn't so very long ago that you had one,\" retorted Tom. \"First  you fellows know, you'll be pulled in for speeding.\"    \"I guess we had better go slower, Andy,\" advised Sam in a low voice.  \"I don't want to be arrested.\"    \"Leave this to me,\" retorted Andy. \"I'm running this tour. The next  time you get in my way I'll run you down!\" he threatened Tom. \"Come  on, fellows, we're late now, and can't make a record run, all on  account of him,\" and Andy got back into the car, followed by his  cronies, who had hurriedly alighted after their thrilling stop.    \"If you try anything like this again you'll wish you hadn't,\"  declared Tom, and he watched the automobile party ride off.    \"Oh, forget it!\" snapped back Andy, and he laughed, his companions  joining.    Tom Swift said nothing in reply. Slowly he remounted his wheel and  rode off, but his thoughts toward Andy Foger were not very pleasant  ones. Andy was the son of a wealthy man of the town, and his good  fortune in the matter of money seemed to have spoiled him, for he  was a bully and a coward. Several times he and Tom Swift had  clashed, for Andy was overbearing. But this was the first time Andy  had shown such a vindictive spirit.    \"He thinks he can run over everything since he got his new auto,\"  commented Tom aloud as he rode on. \"He'll have a smash-up some day,  if he isn't careful. He's too fond of speeding. I wonder where he  and his crowd are going?\"    Musing over his narrow escape Tom rode on, and was soon at his home,  where he lived with his widowed father, Barton Swift, a wealthy  inventor, and the latter's housekeeper, Mrs. Baggert. Approaching a  machine shop, one of several built near his house by Mr. Swift, in  which he conducted experiments and constructed apparatus. Tom was  met by his parent.    \"What's the matter, Tom?\" asked Mr. Swift. \"You look as if something  had happened.\"    \"Something very nearly did,\" answered the youth, and related his  experience on the road.    \"Humph,\" remarked the inventor; \"your little pleasure-jaunt might  have ended disastrously. I suppose Andy and his chums are off on  their trip. I remember Mr. Foger speaking to me about it the other  day. He said Andy and some companions were going on a tour, to be  gone a week or more. Well, I'm glad it was no worse. But have you  anything special to do, Tom?\"    \"No; I was just riding for pleasure, and if you want me to do  anything, I'm ready.\"    \"Then I wish you'd take this letter to Mansburg for me. I want it  registered, and I don't wish to mail it in the Shopton post-office.  It's too important, for it's about a valuable invention.\"    \"The new turbine motor, dad?\"    \"That's it. And on your way I wish you'd stop in Merton's machine  shop and get some bolts he's making for me.\"    \"I will. Is that the letter?\" and Tom extended his hand for a  missive his father held.    \"Yes. Please be careful of it. It's to my lawyers in Washington  regarding the final steps in getting a patent for the turbine.  That's why I'm so particular about not wanting it mailed here.  Several times before I have posted letters here, only to have the  information contained in them leak out before my attorneys received  them. I do not want that to happen in this case. Another thing;  don't speak about my new invention in Merton's shop when you stop  for the bolts.\"    \"Why, do you think he gave out information concerning your work?\"    \"Well, not exactly. He might not mean to, but he told me the other  day that some strangers were making inquiries of him, about whether  he ever did any work for me.\"    \"What did he tell them?\"    \"He said that he occasionally did, but that most of my inventive  work was done in my own shops, here. He wanted to know why the men  were asking such questions, and one of them said they expected to  open a machine shop soon, and wanted to ascertain if they might  figure on getting any of my trade. But I don't believe that was  their object.\"    \"What do you think it was?\"    \"I don't know, exactly, but I was somewhat alarmed when I heard this  from Merton. So I am going to take no risks. That's why I send this  letter to Mansburg. Don't lose it, and don't forget about the bolts.  Here is a blue-print of them, so you can see if they come up to the  specifications.\"    Tom rode off on his wheel, and was soon spinning down the road.    \"I wonder if I'll meet Andy Foger and his cronies again?\" he  thought. \"Not very likely to, I guess, if they're off on a tour.  Well, I'm just as well satisfied. He and I always seem to get into  trouble when we meet.\" Tom was not destined to meet Andy again that  day, but the time was to come when the red-haired bully was to cause  Tom Swift no little trouble, and get him into danger besides. So Tom  rode along, thinking over what his father had said to him about the  letter he carried.    Mr. Barton Swift was a natural inventor. From a boy he had been  interested in things mechanical, and one of his first efforts had  been to arrange a system of pulleys, belts and gears so that the  windmill would operate the churn in the old farmhouse where he was  born. The fact that the mill went so fast that it broke the churn  all to pieces did not discourage him, and he at once set to work,  changing the gears. His father had to buy a new churn, but the young  inventor made his plan work on the second trial, and thereafter his  mother found butter-making easy.    From then on Barton Swift lived in a world of inventions."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#1)"],[1,"FRANKENSTEIN:                                      OR,                             THE MODERN PROMETHEUS.

LONDON:      HENRY COLBURN AND RICHARD BENTLEY,      NEW BURLINGTON STREET:      BELL AND BRADFUTE, EDINBURGH;      AND CUMMING, DUBLIN.      1831.          INTRODUCTION.      The Publishers of the Standard Novels, in selecting \"Frankenstein\" for  one of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish them with  some account of the origin of the story. I am the more willing to  comply, because I shall thus give a general answer to the question, so  very frequently asked me--\"How I, when a young girl, came to think of,  and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?\" It is true that I am very  averse to bringing myself forward in print; but as my account will only  appear as an appendage to a former production, and as it will be  confined to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I  can scarcely accuse myself of a personal intrusion.    It is not singular that, as the daughter of two persons of distinguished  literary celebrity, I should very early in life have thought of writing.  As a child I scribbled; and my favourite pastime, during the hours given  me for recreation, was to \"write stories.\" Still I had a dearer pleasure  than this, which was the formation of castles in the air--the indulging  in waking dreams--the following up trains of thought, which had for  their subject the formation of a succession of imaginary incidents. My  dreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings. In  the latter I was a close imitator--rather doing as others had done,  than putting down the suggestions of my own mind. What I wrote was  intended at least for one other eye--my childhood's companion and  friend; but my dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody;  they were my refuge when annoyed--my dearest pleasure when free.    I lived principally in the country as a girl, and passed a considerable  time in Scotland. I made occasional visits to the more picturesque  parts; but my habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern  shores of the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on retrospection I call  them; they were not so to me then. They were the eyry of freedom, and  the pleasant region where unheeded I could commune with the creatures of  my fancy. I wrote then--but in a most common-place style. It was beneath  the trees of the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides  of the woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy  flights of my imagination, were born and fostered. I did not make myself  the heroine of my tales. Life appeared to me too common-place an affair  as regarded myself. I could not figure to myself that romantic woes or  wonderful events would ever be my lot; but I was not confined to my own  identity, and I could people the hours with creations far more  interesting to me at that age, than my own sensations.    After this my life became busier, and reality stood in place of fiction.  My husband, however, was from the first, very anxious that I should  prove myself worthy of my parentage, and enrol myself on the page of  fame. He was for ever inciting me to obtain literary reputation, which  even on my own part I cared for then, though since I have become  infinitely indifferent to it. At this time he desired that I should  write, not so much with the idea that I could produce any thing worthy  of notice, but that he might himself judge how far I possessed the  promise of better things hereafter. Still I did nothing. Travelling, and  the cares of a family, occupied my time; and study, in the way of  reading, or improving my ideas in communication with his far more  cultivated mind, was all of literary employment that engaged my  attention.    In the summer of 1816, we visited Switzerland, and became the neighbours  of Lord Byron. At first we spent our pleasant hours on the lake, or  wandering on its shores; and Lord Byron, who was writing the third canto  of Childe Harold, was the only one among us who put his thoughts upon  paper. These, as he brought them successively to us, clothed in all the  light and harmony of poetry, seemed to stamp as divine the glories of  heaven and earth, whose influences we partook with him.    But it proved a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain often confined  us for days to the house. Some volumes of ghost stories, translated from  the German into French, fell into our hands. There was the History of  the Inconstant Lover, who, when he thought to clasp the bride to whom he  had pledged his vows, found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of her  whom he had deserted. There was the tale of the sinful founder of his  race, whose miserable doom it was to bestow the kiss of death on all the  younger sons of his fated house, just when they reached the age of  promise. His gigantic, shadowy form, clothed like the ghost in Hamlet,  in complete armour, but with the beaver up, was seen at midnight, by  the moon's fitful beams, to advance slowly along the gloomy avenue. The  shape was lost beneath the shadow of the castle walls; but soon a gate  swung back, a step was heard, the door of the chamber opened, and he  advanced to the couch of the blooming youths, cradled in healthy sleep.  Eternal sorrow sat upon his face as he bent down and kissed the forehead  of the boys, who from that hour withered like flowers snapt upon the  stalk. I have not seen these stories since then; but their incidents are  as fresh in my mind as if I had read them yesterday.    \"We will each write a ghost story,\" said Lord Byron; and his proposition  was acceded to. There were four of us. The noble author began a tale, a  fragment of which he printed at the end of his poem of Mazeppa. Shelley,  more apt to embody ideas and sentiments in the radiance of brilliant  imagery, and in the music of the most melodious verse that adorns our  language, than to invent the machinery of a story, commenced one founded  on the experiences of his early life. Poor Polidori had some terrible  idea about a skull-headed lady, who was so punished for peeping through  a key-hole--what to see I forget--something very shocking and wrong of  course; but when she was reduced to a worse condition than the renowned  Tom of Coventry, he did not know what to do with her, and was obliged to  despatch her to the tomb of the Capulets, the only place for which she  was fitted. The illustrious poets also, annoyed by the platitude of  prose, speedily relinquished their uncongenial task.    I busied myself _to think of a story_,--a story to rival those which had  excited us to this task. One which would speak to the mysterious fears  of our nature, and awaken thrilling horror--one to make the reader dread  to look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the  heart. If I did not accomplish these things, my ghost story would be  unworthy of its name. I thought and pondered--vainly. I felt that blank  incapability of invention which is the greatest misery of authorship,  when dull Nothing replies to our anxious invocations. _Have you thought  of a story?_ I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to  reply with a mortifying negative.    Every thing must have a beginning, to speak in Sanchean phrase; and that  beginning must be linked to something that went before. The Hindoos give  the world an elephant to support it, but they make the elephant stand  upon a tortoise. Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist  in creating out of void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the  first place, be afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless  substances, but cannot bring into being the substance itself. In all  matters of discovery and invention, even of those that appertain to the  imagination, we are continually reminded of the story of Columbus and  his egg. Invention consists in the capacity of seizing on the  capabilities of a subject, and in the power of moulding and fashioning  ideas suggested to it.    Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to  which I was a devout but nearly silent listener. During one of these,  various philosophical doctrines were discussed, and among others the  nature of the principle of life, and whether there was any probability  of its ever being discovered and communicated. They talked of the  experiments of Dr. Darwin, (I speak not of what the Doctor really did,  or said that he did, but, as more to my purpose, of what was then spoken  of as having been done by him,) who preserved a piece of vermicelli in a  glass case, till by some extraordinary means it began to move with  voluntary motion. Not thus, after all, would life be given. Perhaps a  corpse would be re-animated; galvanism had given token of such things:  perhaps the component parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought  together, and endued with vital warmth.    Night waned upon this talk, and even the witching hour had gone by,  before we retired to rest. When I placed my head on my pillow, I did not  sleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden, possessed  and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with  a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I saw--with shut  eyes, but acute mental vision,--I saw the pale student of unhallowed  arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous  phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some  powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital  motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the  effect of"]]]
