SECTION I.--THE COW AND THE BULL IN THE VEDIC HYMNS.    SUMMARY.        Prelude.--The vault of Heaven as a luminous cow.--The gods and      goddesses, sons and daughters of this cow.--The vault of Heaven as a      spotted cow.--The sons and daughters of this cow, _i.e._ the winds,      Marutas, and the clouds, Pricnayas.--The wind-bulls subdue the      cloud-cows.--Indras, the rain-sending, thundering, lightening,      radiant sun, who makes the rain fall and the light return, called      the bull of bulls.--The bull Indras drinks the water of      strength.--Hunger and thirst of the heroes of mythology.--The      cloud-barrel.--The horns of the bull and of the cow are      sharpened.--The thunderbolt-horns.--The cloud as a cow, and even as      a stable or hiding-place for cows.--Cavern where the cows are shut      up, of which cavern the bull Indras and the bulls Marutas remove the      stone, and force the entrance, to reconquer the cows, delivering      them from the monster; the male Indras finds himself again with his      wife.--The cloud-fortress, which Indras destroys and Agnis sets on      fire.--The cloud-forest, which the gods destroy.--The cloud-cow; the      cow-bow; the bird-thunderbolts; the birds come out of the cow.--The      monstrous cloud-cow, the wife of the monster.--Some phenomena of      the cloudy sky are analogous to those of the gloomy sky of night and      of winter.--The moment most fit for an epic poem is the meeting of      such phenomena in a nocturnal tempest.--The stars, cows put to      flight by the sun.--The moon, a milk-yielding cow.--The ambrosial      moon fished up in the fountain, gives nourishment to Indras.--The      moon as a male, or bull, discomfits, with the bull Indras, the      monster.--The two bulls, or the two stallions, the two horsemen, the      twins.--The bull chases the wolf from the waters.--The cow      tied.--The aurora, or ambrosial cow, formed out of the skin of      another cow by the Ribhavas.--The Ribhavas, bulls and wise      birds.--The three Ribhavas reproduce the triple Indras and the      triple Vishnus; their three relationships; the three brothers,      eldest, middle, youngest; the three brother workmen; the youngest      brother is the most intelligent, although at first thought stupid;      the reason why.--The three brothers guests of a king.--The third of      the Ribhavas, the third and youngest son becomes Tritas the third,      in the heroic form of Indras, who kills the monster; Tritas, the      third brother, after having accomplished the great heroic      undertaking, is abandoned by his envious brothers in the well; the      second brother is the son of the cow.--Indras a cowherd, parent of      the sun and the aurora, the cow of abundance, milk-yielding and      luminous.--The cow Sita.--Relationship of the sun to the      aurora.--The aurora as cow-nurse of the sun, mother of the cows; the      aurora cowherd; the sun hostler and cowherd.--The riddle of the      wonderful cowherd; the sun solves the riddle proposed by the      aurora.--The aurora wins the race, being the first to arrive at the      barrier, without making use of her feet.--The chariot of the      aurora.--She who has no feet, who leaves no footsteps; she who is      without footsteps of the measure of the feet; she who has no slipper      (which is the measure of the foot).--The sun who never puts his foot      down, the sun without feet, the sun lame, who, during the night,      becomes blind; the blind and the lame who help each other, whom      Indra helps, whom the ambrosia of the aurora enables to walk and to      see.--The aurora of evening, witch who blinds the sun; the sun      Indras, in the morning, chases the aurora away; Indras subdues and      destroys the witch aurora.--The brother sun follows, as a seducer,      the aurora his sister, and wishes to burn her.--The sun follows his      daughter the aurora.--The aurora, a beautiful young girl, deliverer      of the sun, rich in treasure, awakener of the sleepers, saviour of      mankind, foreseeing; from small becomes large, from dark becomes      brilliant, from infirm, whole, from blind, seeing and protectress of      sight.--Night and aurora, now mother and daughter, now      sisters.--The luminous night a good sister; the gloomy night gives      place to the aurora, her elder or better sister, working, purifying,      cleansing.--The aurora shines only when near the sun her husband,      before whom she dances splendidly dressed; the aurora Urvaci.--The      wife of the sun followed by the monster.--The husband of the aurora      subject to the same persecution.    We are on the vast table-land of Central Asia; gigantic mountains send  forth on every side their thousand rivers; immense pasture-lands and  forests cover it; migratory tribes of pastoral nations traverse it;  the _gopatis_, the shepherd or lord of the cows, is the king; the  gopatis who has most herds is the most powerful. The story begins with  a graceful pastoral idyll.    To increase the number of the cows, to render them fruitful in milk  and prolific in calves, to have them well looked after, is the dream,  the ideal of the ancient Aryan. The bull, the _foecundator_, is the  type of every male perfection, and the symbol of regal strength.    Hence, it is only natural that the two most prominent animal figures  in the mythical heaven should be the cow and the bull.    The cow is the ready, loving, faithful, fruitful Providence of the  shepherd.    The worst enemy of the Aryan, therefore, is he who carries off the  cow; the best, the most illustrious, of his friends, he who is able to  recover it from the hands of the robber.    The same idea is hence transferred to heaven; in heaven there is a  beneficent, fruitful power, which is called the cow, and a beneficent  _foecundator_ of this same power, which is called the bull.    The dewy moon, the dewy aurora, the watery cloud, the entire vault of  heaven, that giver of the quickening and benignant rain, that  benefactress of mankind,--are each, with special predilection,  represented as the beneficent cow of abundance. The lord of this  multiform cow of heaven, he who makes it pregnant and fruitful and  milk-yielding, the spring or morning sun, the rain-giving sun (or  moon) is often represented as a bull.    Now, to apprehend all this clearly, we ought to go back, as nearly as  possible, to that epoch in which such conceptions would arise  spontaneously; but as the imagination so indulged is apt to betray us  into mere fantastical conceits, into an _a priori_ system, we shall  begin by excluding it entirely from these preliminary researches, as  being hazardous and misleading, and content ourselves with the humbler  office of collecting the testimonies of the poets themselves who  assisted in the creation of the mythology in question.    I do not mean to say anything of the Vedic myths that is not taken  from one or other of the hymns contained in the greatest of the Vedas,  but only to arrange and connect together the links of the chain as  they certainly existed in the imagination of the ancient Aryan people,  and which the _Rigvedas_, the work of a hundred poets and of several  centuries, presents to us as a whole, continuous and artistic. I shall  indeed suppose myself in the valley of Kacmira, or on the banks of the  Sindhus, under that sky, at the foot of these mountains, among these  rivers; but I shall search in the sky for that which I find in the  hymns, and not in the hymns for that which I may imagine I see in the  sky. I shall begin my voyage with a trusty chart, and shall consult it  with all the diligence in my power, in order not to lose any of the  advantages that a voyage so full of surprises has to offer. Hence the  notes will all, or nearly all, consist of quotations from my guide, in  order that the learned reader may be able to verify for himself every  separate assertion. And as to the frequent stoppages we shall have to  make by the way, let me ask the reader not to ascribe these to  anything arbitrary on my part, but rather to the necessities of a  voyage, made, as it is, step by step, in a region but little known,  and by the help of a guide, where nearly everything indeed is to be  found, but where, as in a rich inventory, it is easier to lose one's  way than to find it again.    The immense vault of heaven which over-arches the earth, as the eternal  storehouse of light and rain, as the power which causes the grass to  grow, and therefore the animals which pasture upon it, assumes in the  Vedic literature the name of Aditis, or the infinite, the inexhaustible,  the fountain of ambrosia (_amritasya nabhis_). Thus far, however, we  have no personification, as yet we have no myth. The _amritas_ is simply  the immortal, and only poetically represents the rain, the dew, the  luminous wave. But the inexhaustible soon comes to mean that which can  be milked without end--and hence also, a celestial cow, an inoffensive  cow, which we must not offend, which must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38750"],[0,"Current History: A Monthly Magazine of the New York Times, May 1918 (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: PRESIDENT WILSON  The first portrait of President Wilson since America entered the war,  taken at the White House March 19, 1918  ((C) _Sun Printing and Publishing Association_)]          [Illustration: FERDINAND FOCH  Generalissimo of the allied armies on the western front]          CURRENT HISTORY    _A Monthly Magazine of_ =The New York Times=    Published by The New York Times Company, Times Square, New York, N.

The most  desperate and sanguinary battle in history, begun with the great German  offensive in France March 21, 1918, was at its most furious phase when  these pages were printed. No less than 4,000,000 men were engaged in  deadly combat on a front of 150 miles.    General Foch, by agreement of the Allies, was made Commander in Chief of  the allied armies in France, March 28. This decision, long regarded as  of supreme importance, was hastened by the new emergency. The United  States on April 16 officially approved the appointment. The result of  the change was to co-ordinate all the allied forces in France into one  army. Early fruits of this new unity were apparent in the news of April  19, when it was announced that heavy French reinforcements had come that  day to the relief of the hard-pressed and weary British troops in  Flanders, and had halted the Germans; the same day the French  counterattacked in the Amiens region and thrust the Germans back, thus  giving a brighter aspect to the entire situation in France. The story of  the battle of Picardy up to April 18 is told elsewhere in detail.    The separation of Russian provinces from the old Russian Empire  continued during the month; the resistance of the Bolsheviki in Finland,  the Ukraine, Lithuania, the Caucasus, and other provinces that had been  alienated either by secession or by German acquisition grew feebler as  the weeks elapsed, and the stability of the new republics under German  suzerainty was correspondingly strengthened.    The chief political events were the exposure by France of Austria's  duplicity in seeking a separate peace, which caused the downfall of the  Austrian Premier, and the application of conscription to Ireland, to be  followed by home rule. On April 18 Lord Derby was appointed British  Ambassador to France, succeeding Lord Bertie, and was succeeded as  Secretary of State for War by Viscount Milner. Austen Chamberlain, son  of the late Joseph Chamberlain, was made a member of the War Cabinet.    Secretary of War Baker, who had left for England, France, and Italy  early in March, returned on April 17 and spoke in enthusiastic terms of  the American forces abroad. He expressed firm confidence in the ultimate  defeat of Germany.    General Pershing offered all his available forces to General Foch when  the storm of the German offensive broke, and many American units were at  once brigaded with British and French forces. The appeals of France and  Great Britain for man power met with instant response on this side of  the Atlantic, and every ton of available shipping was employed in the  transport of American troops. Developments in this regard gave promise  of fulfilling the War Department's expressed intention of having an  American Army of 1,500,000 in France by the end of 1918.    All American war preparations were visibly speeded up as the situation  grew more serious for the Allies, and the spirit of the nation became  one of widespread determination to win, even though it should require  years of warfare and the entire physical and financial resources of the  United States.      EXECUTION OF BOLO PACHA    Bolo Pacha, who was convicted by a French court-martial of treason, was  executed at Vincennes April 17 by a firing squad. The chaplain, after  the execution, found lying over Bolo's heart two embroidered  handkerchiefs, which had been pierced by the bullets. One was given to  Bolo's brother and the other to his widow.    A few days before the execution the condemned man sent for the public  prosecutor, and, it is stated, made important revelations regarding  former Premier Caillaux and Senator Humbert, against whom similar  charges are pending.    It was proved that Bolo Pacha, whose real name was Paul Bolo, was a poor  man before the war, a pensioner of his brother, Mgr. Bolo, a prominent  French prelate. The testimony revealed that $1,683,000 had been  transferred by the Deutsche Bank at Berlin on the recommendation of  Ambassador Bernstorff to Bolo's credit in New York for the purchase of  Senator Humbert's newspaper, the Paris Journal; Bolo made an offer of  $400,000 for Le Figaro, bought 1,500 shares in Le Rappel for $34,000,  and even approached Clemenceau's Homme Enchaine. Papers he got control  over included Paris-Midi, Le Cri de Paris, a satirical weekly, and La  Revue, of which Jean Finot is editor. The curious thing about the method  employed to make these newspapers serve German interests was that under  Bolo's control they became exponents of \"defeatism\" carried to the  extreme of ultra-French"]]]
