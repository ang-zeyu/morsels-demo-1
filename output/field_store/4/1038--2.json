WEBB      Examination of softshell turtles allied to _Trionyx muticus_ from the  southeastern United States discloses the presence of an undescribed  subspecies inhabiting river systems of the Gulf Coast.    The author is indebted to Mr. Roger Conant for constructive criticism  of the manuscript. I am grateful also to many fellow students for  assistance in field work or for other courtesies, especially William E.  Brode, Franklin Sogandares-Bernal, Ernest A. Liner, Donald W. Tinkle,  Paul K. Anderson, and John K. Greer. The photographs were provided  through the cooperation of Roger and Isabelle Hunt Conant and John M.  Legler.    Collections from which specimens were obtained are as follows: TU  (Tulane University), USNM (United States National Museum), MCZ (Museum  of Comparative Zoology, Harvard College), CNHM (Chicago Natural History  Museum), KU (Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas), UI  (Museum of Natural History, University of Illinois).    Measurements (in millimeters) were made with a Vernier caliper and a  metal tape; those of the holotype were made to the nearest one-tenth  millimeter. Plastral length was measured from the posterior edge of the  plastron to the anteriormost edge of the ventral surface; other  measurements were maximal. Depth of shell was taken only on hatchlings  and an immature female. Hatchlings were arbitrarily designated as  specimens having plastrons shorter than 44 mm; sex of all specimens  except adult males was determined by dissection unless otherwise noted.      =Trionyx muticus calvatus= new subspecies    Gulf Coast Smooth Softshell         _Amyda mutica_ (in part), Stejneger, Bull.

(Occhialini and Powell,  1947)]          A BRIEF HISTORY OF ELEMENT DISCOVERY, SYNTHESIS, AND ANALYSIS      It is well known that the number of elements has grown from four in the  days of the Greeks to 103 at present, but the change in methods needed  for their discovery is not so well known. Up until 1939, only 88  naturally occurring elements had been discovered. It took a dramatic  modern technique (based on Ernest O. Lawrence's Nobel-prize-winning atom  smasher, the cyclotron) to synthesize the most recently discovered  elements. Most of these recent discoveries are directly attributed to  scientists working under the Atomic Energy Commission at the University  of California's Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley.    But it is apparent that our present knowledge of the elements stretches  back into history: back to England's Ernest Rutherford, who in 1919  proved that, occasionally, when an alpha particle from radium strikes a  nitrogen atom, either a proton or a hydrogen nucleus is ejected; to the  Dane Niels Bohr and his 1913 idea of electron orbits; to a once unknown  Swiss patent clerk, Albert Einstein, and his now famous theories; to  Poland's Marie Curie who, in 1898, with her French husband Pierre  laboriously isolated polonium and radium; back to the French scientist  H. A. Becquerel, who first discovered something he called a \"spontaneous  emission of penetrating rays from certain salts of uranium\"; to the  German physicist W. K. Roentgen and his discovery of x rays in 1895; and  back still further.    During this passage of scientific history, the very idea of \"element\"  has undergone several great changes.    The early Greeks suggested earth, air, fire, and water as being the  essential material from which all others were made. Aristotle considered  these as being combinations of four properties: hot, cold, dry, and  moist (see Fig. 1).    [Illustration: Fig. 1. The elements as proposed by the early Greeks.]    Later, a fifth \"essence,\" ether, the building material of the heavenly  bodies was added.    Paracelsus (1493-1541) introduced the three alchemical symbols salt,  sulfur, and mercury. Sulfur was the principle of combustability, salt  the fixed part left after burning (calcination), and mercury the  essential part of all metals. For example, gold and silver were  supposedly different combinations of sulfur and mercury.    Robert Boyle in his \"Sceptical Chymist\" (1661) first defined the word  element in the sense which it retained until the discovery of  radioactivity (1896), namely, a form of matter that could not be split  into simpler forms.    The first discovery of a true element in historical time was that of  phosphorus by Dr. Brand of Hamburg, in 1669. Brand kept his process  secret, but, as in modern times, knowledge of the element's existence  was sufficient to let others, like Kunkel and Boyle in England, succeed  independently in isolating it shortly afterward.    As in our atomic age, a delicate balance was made between the  \"light-giving\" (desirable) and \"heat-giving\" (feared) powers of a  discovery. An early experimenter was at first \"delighted with the white,  waxy substance that glowed so charmingly in the dark of his laboratory,\"  but later wrote, \"I am not making it any more for much harm may come of  it.\"    Robert Boyle wrote in 1680 of phosphorus, \"It shone so briskly and lookt  so oddly that the sight was extreamly pleasing, having in it a mixture  of strangeness, beauty and frightfulness.\"    These words describe almost exactly the impressions of eye witnesses of  the first atom bomb test at Alamagordo, New Mexico, July 16, 1945.    For the next two and three-quarters centuries the chemists had much fun  and some fame discovering new elements. Frequently there was a long  interval between discovery and recognition. Thus Scheele made chlorine  in 1774 by the action of \"black manganese\" (manganese dioxide) on  concentrated muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid), but it was not  recognized as an element till the work of Davy in 1810.    Occasionally the development of a new technique would lead to the \"easy\"  discovery of a whole group of new elements. Thus Davy, starting in 1807,  applied the method of electrolysis, using a development of Volta's pile  as a source of current; in a short time he discovered aluminum, barium,  boron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and strontium.    The invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff in 1859  provided a new tool which could establish the purity of substances  already known and lead to the discovery of others. Thus, helium was  discovered in the sun's spectrum by Jansen and isolated from uranite by  Ramsay in 1895.    The discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel in 1896 (touched off by  Roentgen's discovery of x rays the year before) gave an even more  sensitive method of detecting the presence or absence of certain kinds  of matter. It is well known that Pierre and Marie Curie used this  new-found radioactivity to identify the new elements polonium and  radium. Compounds of these new elements were obtained by patient  fractional recrystallization of their salts.    The \"explanation\" of radioactivity led to the discovery of isotopes by  Rutherford and Soddy in 1914, and with this discovery a revision of our  idea of elements became necessary. Since Boyle, it had been assumed that  all atoms of the individual elements were identical and unlike any  others, and could not be changed into anything simpler. Now it became  evident that the atoms of radioactive elements were constantly changing  into other elements, thereby releasing very large amounts of energy, and  that many different forms of the same element (lead was the first  studied) were possible. We now think of an element as a form of matter  in which all atoms have the same nuclear charge.    The human mind has always sought order and simplification of the  external world; in chemistry the fruitful classifications were  Dobereiner's Triads (1829), Newland's law of octaves (1865), and  Mendeleev's periodic law (1869). The chart expressing this periodic law  seemed to indicate the maximum extent of the elements and gave good  hints \"where to look for\" and \"the probable properties of\" the remaining  ones (see Fig. 2).    By 1925, all but four of the slots in the 92-place file had been filled.  The vacancies were at 43, 61, 85, and 87.    [Illustration: Fig. 2. Periodic chart of the elements (1963)]    Workers using traditional analytical techniques continued to search for  these elements, but their efforts were foredoomed to failure. None of  the nuclei of the isotopes of elements 43, 61, 85, and 87 are stable;  hence weighable quantities of them do not exist in nature, and new  techniques had to be developed before we could really say we had  \"discovered\" them.    In 1919, Rutherford accomplished scientifically what medieval alchemists  had failed to do with \"magic\" experiments and other less sophisticated  techniques. It wasn't gold (the goal of the alchemists) he found but  something more valuable with even greater potential for good and evil: a  method of transmuting one element into another. By bombarding nitrogen  nuclei with alpha particles from radium, he found that nitrogen was  changed into oxygen.    The process for radioactive transmutation is somewhat like a common  chemical reaction. An alpha particle, which has the same charge (+2) and  atomic mass (4) as a helium nucleus, penetrates the repulsive forces of  the nitrogen nucleus and deposits one proton and one neutron; this  changes the nitrogen atom into an oxygen atom. The reaction is written        {7}N<14> + {2}He<4> --> {1}H<1> + {8}O<17>.    The number at the lower left of each element symbol in the above  reaction is the proton number. This number determines the basic chemical  identity of an atom, and it is this number scientists must change before  one element can be transformed into another. The common way to  accomplish this artificially is by bombarding nuclei with nuclear  projectiles.    Rutherford used naturally occurring alpha particles from radium as his  projectiles because they were the most effective he could then find. But  these natural alpha particles have several drawbacks: they are  positively charged, like the nucleus itself, and are therefore more or  less repulsed depending on the proton number of the element being  bombarded; they do not move fast enough to penetrate the nuclei of  heavier elements (those with many protons); and, for various other  reasons (some of them unexplained), are inefficient in breaking up the  nucleus. It is estimated that only 1 out of 300,000 of these alpha  particles will react with nitrogen.    Physicists immediately began the search for"]]]
