And perhaps no other  is more worthy of being cherished and safeguarded in its natural haunts  for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations.    The original valid designation, in technical nomenclature, of the Barren  Ground Caribou of the Mackenzie-Keewatin region dates back to 1829, when  Sir John Richardson described it in the _Fauna Boreali-Americana_ as  _Cervus tarandus_ var. _arctica_. The type locality is Fort Enterprise  (about lat. 64° 30´ N., long. 113° W.), on Winter Lake, an expansion of  Snare River, Mackenzie. Since the typical subspecies appears to lack a  distinguishing common name, it would seem fitting to associate with it  the name of its worthy describer; thus, Richardson's Barren Ground  Caribou. The author's intimate acquaintance with the animal should have  enabled him to draw up a somewhat fuller and more adequate description  than he did. Previous travelers in the Barren Grounds, among whom Samuel  Hearne (1795) was particularly notable, had contributed accounts of the  species, without differentiating it from the Lapland Reindeer (_Rangifer  tarandus_) or without giving it a distinctive technical name.    Since Richardson's time the mainland form of western Canada has been  discussed by many zoologists and explorers. The most comprehensive  account of its life history hitherto published is that by Seton (1929,  +3+: 95-135),[1] whose personal experience was gained in the region of  Artillery, Clinton-Colden, and Aylmer lakes. Dearth of adequate material  (particularly from the type locality or adjacent areas) makes it all but  impossible to determine whether there is any significant geographical  variation between the herds of central Mackenzie and those of Keewatin.        [Footnote 1: This statement, written long before the appearance      of Banfield's work of 1954, no longer applies.]    The foremost objective of an expedition I made in 1947 to Nueltin Lake,  in southwestern Keewatin, was a study of the Barren Ground Caribou. The  expedition was supported by the Arctic Institute of North America, with  funds supplied by the Office of Naval Research. My headquarters were at  the little Windy River trading post, at the northwestern extremity of  Nueltin Lake (map 1). There, for a period of six months, I enjoyed the  fine hospitality of Charles Schweder and Fred Schweder, Jr. They had  lived on intimate terms with the Caribou during most of their youthful  lives, and they freely shared with me the knowledge they had thus gained  concerning the ways of life of these wonderful creatures. They secured  nearly all the specimens that went into my collection. The three other  residents of the post also deserve my gratitude for their general  helpfulness and friendliness; they were 10-year-old Mike Schweder  (brother of Charles and Fred), 15-year-old Anoteelik (an Eskimo boy),  and the latter's sister, 5-year-old Rita.

Copyright, 1911, by Swift & Company      _Keep this book in your kitchen for ready reference_          The Truth about Oleomargarine      Swift's Premium Oleomargarine is a sweet, pure, clean, food product made  from rich cream and edible fats. It contains _every element of  nutrition_ found in the best creamery butter.    The process of manufacture is primitive in its simplicity, but modern in  its cleanliness and purity.    The butter fat in Swift's Premium Oleomargarine is microscopically and  chemically _the same_ as in the best butter; the only difference is _in  the way_ it is secured from the cow.    Butter fat in butter is all obtained by churning. In Swift's Premium  Oleomargarine from 1/3 to 1/2 obtained in that way, the remainder is  pressed from the choicest fat of Government inspected animals. This  pressed fat is called \"Oleo\" hence the name \"Oleomargarine.\"    Rich cream, fancy creamery butter, 'oleo' 'neutral,' vegetable oil and  dairy salt are the _only_ ingredients of Premium Oleomargarine.  'Neutral' is pressed from leaf fat. It is odorless and tasteless.    There is _no coloring matter_ added to Premium Oleomargarine, yet it is  a tempting rich cream color.    Each week day during the year 1911 there has been an average of more  than 400 visitors through our Chicago Oleomargarine Factory.    In addition to this daily inspection by the visiting public our  factories are in complete charge of Government Inspectors.    These men test the quality and character of materials, they see that the  contents of every tierce of 'oleo' and 'neutral' received from the  Refinery is from animals that have passed the rigid Government  inspection. They see that everything about the factories is kept  absolutely clean and sanitary.    Read what a Government expert said about Oleomargarine:    The late Prof. W. O. Atwater, director of the United States Government  Agricultural Experiment Station at Washington:    \"It contains essentially the same ingredients as natural butter from  cow's milk. It is perfectly wholesome and healthy and has a high  nutritious value.\"    Order a carton of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine today to try it. You  will find that it is a delicious, wholesome food product that you can  use in your home and effect a great saving, still maintaining your  standard of good living.    We particularly invite you to visit our factories and see for yourself  the cleanliness surrounding this interesting industry.    {Footer: Did you know that Swift's Premium Oleomargarine contains  essentially the same ingredients as natural butter from cows milk?}          Recipes        You can make exactly as good cakes, pies, cookies, and candies by        substituting for the butter named in your recipes 3/4 the        quantity of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine. On this and the        following pages are a few recipes in which this substitution has        been made. Try them. You will find them good and more economical        than when made with butter.      You may have some favorite recipes that are too expensive on account        of the large amount of butter required. You can reduce their cost        by using Swift's Premium Oleomargarine.      Loaf Fig Cake    Light Part      1/2 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine    1/2 cupful sweet milk    1-1/2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder    1 cupful sugar    1-1/2 cupfuls flour    1 teaspoonful vanilla    Whites of 4 eggs      Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the milk, with which the        vanilla has been mixed. Sift the baking-powder with the flour and        add gradually. Add the whites, well beaten, last.    Dark Part      1/2 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine    3/4 cupful milk    1-1/2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder    Yolks of 4 eggs    1/2 pound of raisins    1-1/2 cupfuls sugar    3 cupfuls flour    1 dessertspoonful each of cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg    1 pound of figs      Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the egg-yolks, well beaten,        then the milk. Sift the baking-powder and spices with the flour        and add gradually. The raisins should be seeded and dredged with        flour, and the figs should be cut in small pieces and dredged        with flour and added to the batter the last thing. Put in the pan        alternate layers of each part and bake in a loaf.    {Footer: The Italian uses olive oil; the Swiss, butter from goat's milk;  and the thrifty American housewife, Swift's Premium Oleomargarine.}      Sugar Cookies      1 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine    1 cupful sour milk    1 teaspoonful soda    2 cupfuls sugar    3 eggs, well beaten    Flavoring to taste    Flour enough to roll out thin      Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the eggs, whites and yolks        beaten together. Dissolve the soda in the sour milk. Add this and        then the flour. Roll out thin.

Lemon Pie      1 cupful sugar    2 tablespoonfuls flour    Yolks of three eggs    1 cupful water    Juice and grated rind of 1 lemon    A lump of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine the size of an egg      Put all together in an oatmeal cooker and cook over hot water until        thick. Take from the fire and cool a little. Line a deep        pie-plate with crust, pour in the lemon mixture, and bake in a        moderate oven until the crust is done. Remove from the oven and        have ready the whites of the three eggs, beaten up stiff, with        three level tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; spread this        meringue smoothly over the pie, return to the oven, and bake a        light brown.      Cornbread      1/4 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine    1 cupful sweet milk    1 cupful cornmeal    1/4 cupful sugar    1 cupful flour    2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder    2 eggs      Sift together meal, flour, baking-powder, and sugar. To this add in        order the milk, the egg-yolks well beaten, the oleomargarine        melted and lastly the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in a        hot oven for thirty to thirty-five minutes. This is particularly        delicious if just before it is done half a cupful of cream is        poured over the top.    {Footer: Have you tasted Swift's Premium Oleomargarine?}      Oatmeal Crackers      3/4 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine    2 cupfuls rolled oats    1/2 cupful milk    1/2 teaspoonful soda    1-1/2 cupfuls raisins chopped fine    2 cupfuls flour    1 cupful sugar    1 teaspoonful cinnamon    3 eggs    A pinch of salt      Cream oleomargarine and sugar.
