In our teaching of plastic anatomy, especially at the Ecole des  Beaux-Arts--where, for the past nine years, we have had the very great  honour of supplementing the teaching of our distinguished master,  Mathias Duval, after having been prosector for his course of lectures  since 1881--it is our practice to give, as a complement to the study of  human anatomy, a certain number of lessons on the anatomy of those  animals which artists might be called on to represent.    Now, we were given to understand that the subject treated in our  lectures interested our hearers, so much so that we were not surprised  to learn that a certain number repeatedly expressed a desire to see  these lectures united in book form.    To us this idea was not new; for many years the work in question had  been in course of preparation, and we had collected materials for it,  with the object of filling up a void of which the existence was to be  regretted. But our many engagements prevented us from executing our  project as early as we would have wished. It is this work which we  publish to-day.    [Illustration: FIG. I.--REPRODUCTION OF A SKETCH BY BARYE (COLLECTIONS  OF THE ANATOMICAL MUSEUM OF THE ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS--HUGUIER MUSEUM).]    Putting aside for a moment the wish expressed by our hearers, we feel  ourselves in duty bound to inquire whether the utility of this  publication is self-evident. Let it be clearly understood that we wish  to express here our opinion on this subject, while putting aside every  personal sentiment of an author.    No one now disputes the value of anatomical studies made in view of  carrying out the artistic representation of man. Nevertheless--for we  must provide against all contingencies--the conviction on this subject  may be more or less absolute; and yet it must possess this character in  an intense degree in order that these studies may be profitable, and  permit the attainment of the goal which is proposed in undertaking them.  It is in this way that we ever strive to train the students whose  studies we direct; not only to admit the value of these studies, but to  be materially and deeply convinced of the fact without any restriction.  Such is the sentiment which we endeavour to create and vigorously  encourage. And we may be permitted to add that we have often been  successful in this direction.    Therefore it is that, at the beginning of our lectures, and in  anticipation of possible objections, we are accustomed to take up the  question of the utility of plastic anatomy. And in so doing, it is in  order to combat at the outset the idea--as mischievous as it is  false--which is sometimes imprudently enunciated, that the possession of  scientific knowledge is likely to tarnish the purity and freshness of  the impressions received by the artist, and to place shackles on the  emotional sincerity of their representation.    [Illustration: FIG. II.--REPRODUCTION OF A SKETCH OF BARYE (COLLECTIONS  OF THE ANATOMICAL MUSEUM OF THE ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS--HUGUIER MUSEUM).]    It is chiefly by employment of examples that we approach the subject.  These strike the imagination of the student more forcibly, and the  presentation of models of a certain choice, although rough in execution,  is, in our opinion, preferable to considerations of an order possibly  more exalted, but of a character less clearly practical. Let us, then,  ask the question: Those artists whose eminence nobody would dare to  question, did they study anatomy? If the answer be in the affirmative,  we surely cannot permit ourselves to believe that we can dispense with a  similar course. And, as proof of the studies of this class which the  masters have made, we may cite Raphael, Michelangelo, and, above all,  Leonardo da Vinci; and, of the moderns, Gericault. And we may more  clearly define these proofs by an examination of the reproductions of  their anatomical works, chosen from certain of their special  writings.[1]      [1] Mathias Duval and A. Bical, 'L'anatomie des Maitres.' Thirty        plates reproduced from the originals of Leonardo da Vinci,        Michelangelo, Raphael, Gericault, etc., with letterpress and a        history of plastic anatomy, Paris, 1890.

Accordingly, there is no scope for serious discussion, and it only  remains for us to enunciate the opinion that it is necessary that we  should imitate those masters, and, with a sense of respectful  discipline, follow their example.    Here, with regard to the anatomy of animals, we pursue the same method,  and the example chosen shall be that of Barye. His talent is too far  above all criticism to allow that this example should be refused. The  admiration which the works of this great artist elicit is too  wide-spread for us to remain uninfluenced by the lessons furnished by  his studies. It is sufficient to see the sketches relating to these  studies, and his admirable casts from nature which form part of the  anatomical museum of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, to be convinced that the  artistic temperament, of which Barye was one of the most brilliant  examples, has nothing to lose by its association with researches the  precision of which might seem likely to check its complete expansion.    [Illustration: FIG. III.--REPRODUCTION OF A SKETCH OF BARYE (COLLECTIONS  OF THE ANATOMICAL MUSEUM OF THE ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS--HUGUIER MUSEUM).]    In those sketches we find proofs of observation so scrupulous that we  cannot restrain our admiration for the man whose ardent imagination  was voluntarily subjected to the toil of study so profound.    If the example of Barye, with whom we associate the names of other great  modern painters of animals, can determine the conviction which we seek  to produce, we shall be sincerely glad. To contribute to the propagation  of useful ideas, and to see them accepted, gives a feeling of  satisfaction far too legitimate for us to hesitate to say what we should  feel if our hope be realized in this instance.

At all events, I know that no attempt has been made  previously, as far as the folklore of the Noongahburrahs is concerned.  Therefore, on the authority of Professor Max Muller, that folk-lore of  any country is worth collecting, I am emboldened to offer my small  attempt, at a collection, to the public. There are probably many who,  knowing these legends, would not think them worth recording; but, on  the other hand, I hope there are many who think, as I do, that we  should try, while there is yet time, to gather all the information  possible of a race fast dying out, and the origin of which is so  obscure. I cannot affect to think that these little legends will do  much to remove that obscurity, but undoubtedly a scientific and patient  study of the folk-lore throughout Australia would greatly assist  thereto. I, alas! am but an amateur, moved to my work by interest in  the subject, and in the blacks, of whom I have had some experience.    The time is coming when it will be impossible to make even such a  collection as this, for the old blacks are quickly dying out, and the  young ones will probably think it beneath the dignity of their  so-called civilisation even to remember such old-women's stories. Those  who have themselves attempted the study of an unknown folk-lore will be  able to appreciate the difficulties a student has to surmount before he  can even induce those to talk who have the knowledge he desires. In  this, as in so much else, those who are ready to be garrulous know  little.    I have confined this little book to the legends of the Narran tribe,  known among themselves as Noongahburrahs. It is astonishing to find,  within comparatively short distances, a diversity of language and  custom. You may even find the same word in different tribes bearing a  totally different meaning. Many words, too, have been introduced which  the blacks think are English, and the English think are native. Such,  for example, as piccaninny, and, as far as these outside blacks are  concerned, boomerang is regarded as English, their local word being  burren; yet nine out of ten people whom you meet think both are local  native words.    Though I have written my little book in the interests of folk-lore, I  hope it will gain the attention of, and have some interest for,  children--of Australian children, because they will find stories of old  friends among the Bush birds; and of English children, because I hope  that they will be glad to make new friends, and so establish a free  trade between the Australian and English nurseries--wingless, and  laughing birds, in exchange for fairy godmothers, and princes in  disguise.    I must also acknowledge my great indebtedness to the blacks, who, when  once they understood what I wanted to know, were most ready to repeat  to me the legends repeating with the utmost patience, time after time,  not only the legends, but the names, that I might manage to spell them  so as to be understood when repeated. In particular I should like to  mention my indebtedness to Peter Hippi, king of the Noongahburrahs; and  to Hippitha, Matah, Barahgurrie, and Beemunny.    I have dedicated my booklet to Peter Hippi, in grateful recognition of  his long and faithful service to myself and my husband, which has  extended, with few intervals, over a period of twenty years. He, too,  is probably the last king of the Noongabburrahs, who are fast dying  out--, and soon their weapons, bartered by them for tobacco or whisky,  alone will prove that they ever existed. It seemed to me a pity that  some attempt should not be made to collect the folk-lore of the quickly  disappearing tribe--a folk-lore embodying, probably, the thoughts,  fancies, and beliefs of the genuine aboriginal race, and which, as  such, deserves to be, indeed, as Max Muller says, \"might be and ought  to be, collected in every part of the world.\"    The legends were told to me by the blacks themselves, some of whom  remember the coming of Mitchellan, as they call Major Mitchell, the  explorer of these back creeks. The old blacks laugh now when they tell  you how frightened their mothers were of the first wheel tracks they  saw. They would not let the children tread on them, but carefully  lifted them over, lest their feet should break out in sores, as they  were supposed to do if they trod on a snake's track. But with all their  fear, little did they realise that the coming of Mitchellan was the  beginning of their end, or that fifty years afterwards, from the  remnant of their once numerous tribe, would be collected the legends  they told in those days to their piccaninnies round their camp-fires,  and those legends used to make a Christmas booklet for the children of  their white supplanters.    I can only hope that the white children will be as ready to listen to  these stories as were, and indeed are, the little piccaninnies, and  thus the sale of this booklet be such as to enable me to add frocks and  tobacco when I give their Christmas dinner, as is my yearly custom, to  the remnant of the Noongahburrahs.    K. LANGLOH PARKER,    BANGATE, NARRAN RIVER, NEW SOUTH WALES,      June 24th, 1895.          INTRODUCTION      Australia makes an appeal to the fancy which is all its own. When  Cortes entered Mexico, in the most romantic moment of history, it was  as if men had found their way to a new planet, so strange, so long  hidden from Europe was all that they beheld. Still they found kings,  nobles, peasants, palaces, temples, a great organised society, fauna  and flora not so very different from what they had left behind in  Spain. In Australia all was novel, and, while seeming fresh, was  inestimably old. The vegetation differs from ours; the monotonous grey  gum-trees did not resemble our varied forests, but were antique,  melancholy, featureless, like their own continent of rare hills,  infrequent streams and interminable deserts, concealing nothing within  their wastes, yet promising a secret. The birds and beasts--kangaroo,  platypus, emu--are ancient types, rough grotesques of Nature, sketching  as a child draws. The natives were a race without a history, far more  antique than Egypt, nearer the beginnings than any other people. Their  weapons are the most primitive: those of the extinct Tasmanians were  actually palaeolithic. The soil holds no pottery, the cave walls no  pictures drawn by men more advanced; the sea hides no ruined palaces;  no cities are buried in the plains; there is not a trace of  inscriptions or of agriculture. The burying places contain relics of  men perhaps even lower than the existing tribes; nothing attests the  presence in any age of men more cultivated. Perhaps myriads of years  have gone by since the Delta, or the lands beside Euphrates and Tigris  were as blank of human modification as was the whole Australian  continent.    The manners and rites of the natives were far the most archaic of all  with which we are acquainted. Temples they had none: no images of gods,  no altars of sacrifice; scarce any memorials of the dead. Their worship  at best was offered in hymns to some vague, half-forgotten deity or  First Maker of things, a god decrepit from age or all but careless of  his children. Spirits were known and feared, but scarcely defined or  described. Sympathetic magic, and perhaps a little hypnotism, were all  their science. Kings and nations they knew not; they were wanderers,  houseless and homeless. Custom was king; yet custom was tenacious,  irresistible, and as complex in minute details as the etiquette of  Spanish kings, or the ritual of the Flamens of Rome. The archaic  intricacies and taboos of the customs and regulations of marriage might  puzzle a mathematician, and may, when unravelled, explain the less  complicated prohibitions of a totemism less antique. The people  themselves in their struggle for existence had "]]]
