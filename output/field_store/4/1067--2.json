I  realize that this sort of free advertisement is eminently unjust to  other worthy houses handling the same lines of goods, but the case is  one of self-defense. In _The Forest_ I rashly offered to send to  inquirers the name of the firm making a certain kind of tent. At this  writing I have received and answered _over eleven hundred_ inquiries.  Since the publication of these papers in _The Outing Magazine_, I have  received hundreds of requests for information as to where this, that, or  the other thing may be had. I have tried to answer them all, but to do  so has been a tax on time I would not care to repeat. Therefore I shall  try in the following pages to give the reader all the practical  information I possess, even though, as stated, I may seem unduly to  advertise the certain few business houses with which I have had  satisfactory dealings. It is needless to remark that I am interested in  none of these firms, and have received no especial favors from them.

Always I have  replied unhesitatingly; for no matter how useful or desirable such  attributes as patience, courage, strength, endurance, good nature, and  ingenuity, may prove to be, undoubtedly a man with them but without the  sense of direction, is practically helpless in the wilds.    [Sidenote: The Sense of Direction]    A sense of direction, therefore, I should name as the prime requisite  for him who would become a true woodsman, depending on himself rather  than on guides. The faculty is largely developed, of course, by much  practice; but it must be inborn. Some men possess it; others do  not--just as some men have a mathematical bent while to others figures  are always a despair. It is a sort of extra, having nothing to do with  criterions of intelligence or mental development, like the repeater  movement in a watch. A highly educated or cultured man may lack it; the  roughest possess it. Some who have never been in the woods or mountains  acquire in the space of a vacation a fair facility at picking a way; and  I have met a few who have spent their lives on the prospect trail, and  who were still, and always would be, as helpless as the newest city  dweller. It is a gift, a talent. If you have its germ, you can become a  traveler of the wide and lonely places. If you have it not, you may as  well resign yourself to guides.    [Sidenote: The Sense of Direction]    The sense of direction in its simplest and most elementary phase, of  course, leads a man back to camp, or over a half-forgotten trail. The  tenderfoot finds his way by little landmarks, and an attempt to remember  details. A woodsman adds to this the general \"lay\" of the country, the  direction its streams ought to flow, the course the hills must take,  the dip of strata, the growth of trees. So if the tenderfoot forgets  whether he turns to right or left at a certain half-remembered burnt  stub, he is lost. But if at the same point the woodsman's memory fails  him, he turns unhesitatingly to the left, because he knows by all the  logic of nature's signboards that the way must be to the left. A good  mountaineer follows the half-obliterated trails as much by his knowledge  of where a trail _must_ go, as by the sparse indications that men have  passed that way. I have traveled all day in the Sierras over apparently  virgin country. Yet every few hours we would come on the traces of an  old trail. We were running in and out of it all day; and at night we  camped by it.    That is, as I have said, elementary. It has to do with a country over  which your woodsman has already traveled, or about which he knows  something. In the last analysis, however, it means something more.    The sense of direction will take a man through a country of which he  knows nothing whatever. He travels by the _feel_ of it, he will tell  you. This means that his experience subconsciously arranges certain  factors from which the sixth sense we are discussing draws certain  deductions. A mountaineer, for example, recognizes the altitude by the  vegetation. Knowing the altitude he knows also the country formation,  and so he can tell at once whether the canyon before him will narrow to  an impassable gorge, or remain open enough to admit of passage. This in  turn determines whether he shall choose the ravines or ridges in  crossing a certain divide, and exactly how he can descend on the other  side. The example is one of the simpler. A good man thus noses his way  through a difficult country with considerable accuracy where a  tenderfoot would become speedily lost.    [Sidenote: Thoroughness]    [Sidenote: Be Sure You Are Right]    But if a sense of direction is the prime requisite, thoroughness presses  it close. It is sometimes very difficult to command the necessary  patience. At the end of a hard day, with the almost moral certainty that  the objective point is just ahead, it is easy, fatally easy, when the  next dim blaze does not immediately appear, to say to oneself--\"Oh, it's  near enough\"--and to plunge ahead. And then, nine times out of ten, you  are in trouble. \"I guess this is all right\" has lost many a man; and the  haste too great to be sure--and then again sure--has had many fatal  results. If it is a trail, then be certain you see indications before  proceeding. Should they fail, then go back to the last indication and  start over again. If it is new country, then pick up every consideration  in your power, and balance them carefully before making the smallest  decision. And all the time keep figuring. Once having decided on a  route, do not let the matter there rest. As you proceed keep your eyes  and mind busy, weighing each bit of evidence. And if you become  suspicious that you are on the wrong tack, turn back unhesitatingly, no  matter how time presses.    A recent expedition with a fatal termination illustrates this point  completely. At first sight it may seem invidious to call attention to  the mistakes of a man who has laid down his life in payment for them.  But it seems to me that the chief value of such sad accidents--beyond  the lessons of courage, endurance, comradeship, devotion, and beautiful  faith--lies in the lesson and warning to those likely to fall into the  same blunders. I knew Hubbard, both at college and later, and admire and  like him. I am sure he would be the first to warn others from repeating  his error.    [Sidenote: Fatal Result of not Being Sure]    The expedition of which I speak started out with the purpose of  exploring Labrador. As the season is short some haste was necessary. The  party proceeded to the head of a certain lake into which they had been  told they would find a river flowing. They found a river, ascended it,  were conquered by the extreme difficulties of the stream, one of the  party perished, and the others came near to it.    As for the facts so far: The first thought to occur to a man entirely  accustomed to wilderness travel would be, is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32958"],[0,"Edge Hill: The Battle and Battlefield; With Notes on Banbury & Thereabout (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net.                    [Illustration: THE TOWER, EDGE HILL.]            EDGE HILL:    THE BATTLE AND BATTLEFIELD.      WITH    Notes on Banbury & Thereabout.        BY    EDWIN A.

Preface to Edition, 1904.      For the present edition the available material of the last eighteen years  has been consulted, but the plans of battle are similar to two of those of  my book of 1886. They were then the first series of diagrammatic  representations of the fight published, but in no case has this been  acknowledged in the many plans of like kind subsequently published. Some  new facts and inferences the author hopes may increase the value of the  account.    The letters of Captain Nathaniel Fiennes and Captain Kightley, now added,  may serve to make the tale a more living one. They are reproduced, by the  kind courtesy of the authorities of the Radcliffe Library, Oxford, and the  Birmingham Reference Library.    New pages of Notes on Banbury, and an extended bibliography are also  given.    EDWIN A. WALFORD.    _Banbury,    March, 1904._          Preface to First Edition.      In the following pages an endeavour has been made to give a concise  account of the physical features of the Edge Hill district, as well as to  describe the events of the first great battle of the Civil War, with which  it is so intimately associated. The intention is to provide a handbook for  the guidance of the visitor rather than to attempt any elaborate  historical or scientific work. Though Nugent's \"Memorials of John Hampden\"  has supplied the basis of the information, Clarendon's \"History of the  Great Rebellion,\" the various pamphlets of the time, and Beesley's  \"History of Banbury,\" have also been freely used. In order to avoid  burdening the pages with foot notes, a catalogue of works upon the subject  is printed as an appendix, and the letters and numbers throughout the text  refer thereto. The catalogue, it is hoped, may be of use to the future  student. The plans of the battle, based upon Nugent's account, must be  looked upon as merely diagrammatic, the scale being unavoidably distorted  for the purpose of showing the conjectured positions of the troops. In the  plans it may be worth note that the troops then known as \"dragooners\" are  classed with the infantry.    The \"Notes on Banbury and Thereabouts\" are in part reproduced from a small  pamphlet published in 1879. Much of the detail relating to the older  buildings has been derived from Skelton's \"Antiquities of Oxfordshire\" and  Parker's descriptions in Beesley's History.    To Mr. W. L. Whitehorn my thanks are due for aid in the revision of \"Edge  Hill,\" and in the compilation of the \"Notes.\"    EDWIN A. WALFORD.    _Banbury,    July 7th, 1886._          EDGE HILL: THE BATTLE AND BATTLEFIELD.      I.    To Edge Hill from Banbury a good road trends gradually up hill nearly the  whole way. It rises from the 300 foot level of the Cherwell Vale to 720 at  the highest ground of the ridge of the hill. At a distance of eight miles  to the North-West is the edge or escarpment of high ground bounded on the  East side by the vale of a tributary of the Cherwell, and on the North and  West by the plain drained by the tributaries of the Avon. From Warmington,  six miles from Banbury, North-Westwards to the point marked on the  Ordnance Map as Knowle End, and thence South-Westwards to the Sun Rising,  once the site of a hostelry on the Banbury and Stratford-on-Avon coach  road, the edge makes a right angle with the apex at Knowle End. The  nearest point of the hill range is at Warmington, where a fine fourteenth  century Church stands high above the rock of the roadway. There is the  first record of the battle--a simple headstone to the right of the path to  the South porch telling how one Captain Alexander Gourdin had died on  October 24th, 1642, the day after the fight. From the church-yard long  flights of steps lead to the roadway and village below, where the house  tops show through the foliage of the apple orchards in which they are  partly hidden. Across the vale, three miles to the North, is the range of  the Burton Dassett Hills, an outlier of the Edge Hill range. The Windmill  Hill, the most distant, bears the Beacon House; the square tower of Burton  Dassett Church may be seen amongst the elms on the lower slopes of Church  Hill; Bitham Hill appears in the foreground of the range with the pretty  spire and village of Avon Dassett close at hand.    Westward of Warmington Church runs Camp Lane. It winds along the ridge,  and commands wide views of the plain lands. A beautiful field path springs  from the South side of the lane leading through the village of Ratley to  the Round House and Ratley Grange. Facing Southwards, one looks upon an  equally pleasant though more circumscribed view--the vale of Hornton. The  Arlescot Woods clothe the Northern slopes, and the Manor House rests  amongst the fine trees below. The terraced fields of Adsum Hollow are  three miles down vale Southward, and Nadbury Camp, supposedly a  Romano-british remain, is but a remnant of similar _natural_ terracing on  the South side of the Camp Lane above Arlescot.    At Knowle End, where the road to Kineton plunges steeply down hill, is the  first point of the battle ground and the commencement, strictly speaking,  of Edge Hill. A short distance down the Kineton Road, a pathway on the  right leads under overspreading beech and oak trees for some distance  along the crest of the Knoll, whence a good side view of the hill may be  got. The gate on the opposite side of the Kineton Road opens to a path  through the Radway Woods, and from it, where the foliage is less dense a  prospect opens of many wide leagues of fair midland country--a veritable  patchwork of field and hedgerow. The furze below covers in part Bullet  Hill, the last stand of the Royalists on the battle ground. The road from  Kineton as well as the footway through the woods leads to Edge Hill Tower,  or Round House. Covering the steep hill sides are beech, elm, chestnut  and lime trees of exceptionally fine growth and a wealth of common wild  flowers. The Tower or Round House is an inn, which, with a  _modern-antique_ ruin, makes as it were a landscape gardening adjunct to  Radway Grange lying in the park below. From its upper room is obtained a  fine view of the country. It is an octagonal tower, and was erected with  artificial ruins in 1750 to mark the spot where the King's Standard was  displayed before the Royalist army descended into the plain to give  battle. The village of Radway rests amongst the elms near the foot of the  hill, the church spire being one of the prominent objects of the  foreground. Kineton lies about four miles directly to the North, beyond  which Warwick Castle may be sometimes descried, or the yet more distant  spires of Coventry. Some distance from the Burton hills the smoke of the  Harbury lime works drifts across the landscape. The farms Battledon and  Thistledon, about midway between Radway and Kineton, marked by the  coppices which almost hide the homesteads, are noted from the fact of so  much of the fight having revolved round them.    The footway to the Sun Rising, 1-1/2 miles S.W. of the Round House,  follows the hill side, and though still pleasantly wooded, soon gets  clear of that heavy growth of foliage which has hitherto shut out so much  of the view. The eye ranges over the flat Warwickshire plain in front, to  the hills of Gloucestershire and Worcestershire on the West and the  North-West. The North-Eastern outliers of the Cotteswolds, the hills of  Ebrington and Ilmington, are the nearest in prominence Westwards, beyond  which a clear day will allow even the distant slopes of the Malverns to be  seen. The Bromsgrove, Clent and Clee hills fringe the North-West horizon,  and sometimes the Wrekin is said to appear \"like a thin cloud\" far away.    At the point where the pathway enters the Stratford-on-Avon road stands  Edge Hill House (the Sun Rising) wherein years ago were some curious  relics of the fight: breast-plates, swords, matchlocks, and a sword  supposed on the evidence of emblems in its decoration to have belonged to  the Earl Lindsay, who commanded the royalists forces prior to the battle,  and who received his death wound in the fight.    In a fir coppice about 200 or 300 yards to the South of the house, the  figure of a red horse roughly cut in the turf of the hill side might  formerly be seen. Dugdale[h] gives the following account of it: \"Within  the Precinct of that Manour in Tysoe, now belonging to the E. of  Northampton (but antiently to the Family of Stafford, as I have shewed)  there is cut upon the side of Edg-Hill the Proportion of a Horse, in a  very large Forme; which by Reason of the ruddy Colour of the Earth, is  called THE RED HORSE, and gives Denomination to that fruitfull and  pleasant Countrey thereabouts, commonly called The Vale of Red Horse. The  Trenches of which Ground, where the Shape of the said Horse is so cut out,  being yearly scoured by a Freeholder in this Lordship, who holds certain  Lands there by that service.\" There is a tradition quoted by Beesley[b] of  its having been cut to commemorate the slaughter of a chieftain's horse at  the battle of Towton, in 1461, the chieftain preferring to share the  perils of the fight with his followers.      II.    The reign of King Charles I. showed a widening of the difference between  the ecclesiastic and puritan elements of the English community--elements  which were the centres of the subsequently enlarged sections, royalist and  parliamentarian. In the later dissentions between the King and the Commons  it was early apparent how widespread had been the alienation of the  people from the King's cause--an"]]]
