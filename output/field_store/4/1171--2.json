Intensive  field studies were made of free-living, marked populations in two  small areas of Douglas County, Kansas, in the period 1954 to 1956.  Laboratory studies were made, whenever possible, of phenomena  difficult to observe in the field, or to clarify or substantiate field  observations. Certain phases of the work (for example, studies of  populations and movements) were based almost entirely on field  observation whereas other phases (for example, growth and gametogenic  cycles) were carried out almost entirely within the laboratory on  specimens obtained from eastern Kansas and other localities.    A taxonomic revision of the genus _Terrapene_ was begun in 1956 as an  outgrowth of the present study. The systematic status of _T. ornata_  and other species is here discussed only briefly.    Objectives of the study here reported on were: 1) to learn as much as  possible concerning the habits, adaptations, and life history of _T.  o. ornata_; 2) to compare the information thus acquired with  corresponding information on other emyid and testudinid chelonians,  and especially with that on other species and subspecies of  _Terrapene_; 3) to determine what factors limit the geographic  distribution of ornate box turtles; and, 4) to determine the role of  ornate box turtles in an ecological community.      Acknowledgments    The aid given by a number of persons has contributed substantially to  the present study. I am grateful to my wife, Avis J. Legler, who, more  than any single person, has unselfishly contributed her time to this  project; in addition to making all the histological preparations and  typing the entire manuscript, she has assisted and encouraged me in  every phase of the study. Dr. Henry S. Fitch has been most helpful in  offering counsel and encouragement. Thanks are due Professor E.  Raymond Hall for critically reading the manuscript.    Special thanks are due also to the following persons: Professor A. B.  Leonard for helpful suggestions dealing with photography and for  advice on several parts of the manuscript; Professor William C. Young  for the use of facilities at the Endocrine Laboratory, University of  Kansas; Professor Edward H. Taylor for permission to study specimens  in his care; Dr. Richard B. Loomis for identifying chigger mites and  offering helpful suggestions on the discussion of ectoparasites; Mr.  Irwin Ungar for identification of plants; and, Mr. William R.  Brecheisen for allowing me to examine his field notes and for  assistance with field work. Identifications of animal remains in  stomachs were made by Professor A. B. Leonard (mollusks, crustaceans),  Dr. George W. Byers (arthropods), and Dr. Sydney Anderson (mammals).    Miss Sophia Damm generously permitted the use of her property as a  study area and Mr. Walter W. Wulfkuhle made available two saddle  horses that greatly facilitated field work. The drawings (with the  exception of Fig. 21) are by Miss Lucy Jean Remple. All photographs  are by the author.    I am grateful also to the Kansas Academy of Science for three research  grants (totaling $175.00) that supported part of the work. The brief  discussion of taxonomic relationships and distribution results partly  from studies made by means of two research grants (totaling $150.00),  from the Graduate School, University of Kansas, for which I thank Dean  John H. Nelson.      Systematic Relationships and Distribution    Turtles of the genus _Terrapene_ belong to the Emyidae, a family  comprising chiefly aquatic and semiaquatic species. _Terrapene_,  nevertheless, is adapted for terrestrial existence and differs from  all other North American emyids in having a hinged and movable  plastron and a down-turned (although often notched) maxillary beak.  _Emydoidea blandingi_, the only other North American emyid with a  hinged plastron, lacks a down-turned beak. The adaptations of box  turtles to terrestrial existence (reduction of webbing between toes,  reduction in number of phalanges, reduction of zygomatic arch, and  heightening of shell) occur in far greater degree in true land  tortoises of the family Testudinidae. Four genera of emyid turtles in  the eastern hemisphere (_Cuora_, _Cyclemys_, _Emys_, and _Notochelys_)  possess terrestrial adaptations paralleling those of _Terrapene_ but  (with the possible exception of _Cuora_) the adaptations are less  pronounced than in _Terrapene_. A movable plastron has occurred  independently in two groups of emyids in the New World and in at least  three groups in the Old World.    The genus _Terrapene_, in my view, contains seven species, comprising  11 named kinds. Of these species, five are poorly known and occur only "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37595"],[0,"Ecological Studies of the Timber Wolf in Northeastern Minnesota (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net                        USDA FOREST SERVICE  RESEARCH PAPER NC-52  1971    [Illustration]    Ecological  Studies of the  TIMBER  WOLF  in  Northeastern  Minnesota      NORTH CENTRAL FOREST EXPERIMENT STATION  FOREST SERVICE  U.

Many of these wolves  inhabit the Superior National Forest, so protecting the habitat of this  endangered species is largely a Forest Service responsibility.    As the \"Age of Ecology\" broadens into the 1970's, wolves and wolf  habitat will become a subject of concerted research. Forest land  managers will have to know more about how the timber wolf fits into a  forest system. Building on nearly 50 years of research in northern  forests, we at the North Central Station intend to expand our studies  of wildlife habitat.

David Mech, L. D. Frenzel, Jr.,  Robert R. Ream, and John W. Winship      The largest population of wolves (_Canis lupus_) remaining today in the  continental United States outside of Alaska is in northern Minnesota.  As of mid-1970 this population was not legally protected, and the  species, which once ranged over almost all of North America, is now  considered by the U.S. Department of the Interior to be in danger of  extinction in the contiguous 48 States. Until the present research, the  only field studies of Minnesota wolves were those of Olson (1938 a, b)  and Stenlund (1955). Those investigations provided much useful general  information about Minnesota wolves and gave the present authors an  excellent background with which to begin more detailed investigations.    This paper reports on the basic aspects of a series of studies that  began in 1964, and concentrates primarily on wolf movements and  activity, social behavior, hunting behavior, and population  organization. Most of the data were collected during January, February,  and March 1967; February, November, and December 1968; and January  through August 1969. A total of 192 days was spent in the field.    According to a distribution map of wolf subspecies (Goldman 1944), the  race of wolves in our study area is _Canis lupus lycaon_. However,  evidence presented by Mech and Frenzel (see page 60) suggests that  there may be strong influence by _C. l. nubilus_, a more western race  of wolf formerly thought to be extinct (Goldman 1944).    Between 1965 and the present, wolves in the study area were neither  protected nor bountied, and the influence of trapping and hunting is  thought to have been negligible.      THE STUDY AREA    This study was conducted in the Superior National Forest (fig. 1) in  northern St. Louis, Lake, and Cook Counties of northeastern Minnesota  (92 deg. west longitude, 48 deg. north latitude), an area well described by  Stenlund (1955). Most of the data were collected from within and  immediately south of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, a special  wilderness region in which travel by motorized vehicles is restricted.  The total study area encompasses approximately 1.5 million acres, and  numerous lakes and rivers comprise about 15 percent of this area (fig.  2). The topography varies from large stretches of swamps to rocky  ridges, with altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,300 feet above sea level  (fig. 3). Winter temperatures lower than -30 deg. F. are not unusual, and  snow depths generally range from 20 to 30 inches on the level. However,  an important exception occurred in early 1969 when depths of 45 inches  and more accumulated in much of the area. Further details on snow  conditions in the study area during the period of this investigation  are given by Mech _et al._ (see page 51). Conifers predominate in the  forest overstory, with the following species present: jack pine (_Pinus  banksiana_ Lamb.), white pine (_P. strobus_ L.), red pine (_P.  resinosa_ Ait.), black spruce (_Picea_ mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), white  spruce (_P. glauca_ (Moench) Voss), balsam fir (_Abies balsamea_ (L.)  Mill.), white cedar (_Thuja occidentalis_ L.), and tamarack (_Larix  laricina_ (DuRoi) K. Koch). However, as a result of extensive cutting  and fires much of the conifer cover is interspersed with large stands  of white birch (_Betula papyrifera_ Marsh.) and aspen (_Populus  tremuloides_ Michx.). Detailed descriptions of the forest vegetation  were presented by Ohmann and Ream (1969).

Mech.)_]      METHODS    The observations discussed in this paper were all made from aircraft,  the method of flying being that reported by Burkholder (1959) and Mech  (1966a). The following aircraft were used (in order of size): Aeronca  Champ,[1] Supercub, Cessna 172, Cessna 180, and Cessna 206. The smaller  aircraft were excellent for holding in tight circles during  observations but had the disadvantage of being slow and cold; the  larger planes could cover the study area much more quickly and were  more comfortable, but were not as maneuverable during observations. For  radiotracking, to be discussed below, the best compromise seemed to be  a Cessna 172.    To make observations of wolves, we flew over frozen waterways until  tracks were found, and then followed the tracks until we lost them or  saw the wolves (fig. 4). Several times we located wolves directly just  by scanning the lakes. However, because there seemed to be a number of  packs in the area, and because most wolves were the same color (with  the exception of a few black or white individuals) (see Mech and  Frenzel, page 60), it usually was not possible to follow packs from one  day to the next and be certain of identification. Moreover, it was  impossible to locate any pack at will because most wolves also spent  much time inland.    [Illustration: _Figure 4.--An important technique used in the study  involved aerial tracking and observing of wolf packs. (Photo courtesy  of L. D. Frenzel.)_]    Therefore, to facilitate our observations and to obtain data on wolf  movements and extent of range, we began a radiotracking program in  1968-69. A professional trapper, Robert Himes, was employed to capture  the wolves. Using Newhouse No. 4 and 14 steel traps at scent-post sets,  he caught two wolves, and captured another with a live-snare similar to  that used by Nellis (1968); the senior author trapped two additional  wolves (fig. 5).    [Illustration: _Figure 5.--A wolf caught in a trap. (Photo courtesy of  D. L. Breneman.)_]    The four wolves held in steel traps were restrained by a choker (fig.  6), and then anesthetized by intramuscular injections (fig. 7A, B) of a  combination of 30 mg. of phencyclidine hydrochloride (Sernylan,  Parke-Davis Co.) and 25 mg. promazine hydrochloride (Sparine, Wyeth  Laboratories) as prescribed by Seal and Erickson (1969); these drugs  proved most satisfactory.
