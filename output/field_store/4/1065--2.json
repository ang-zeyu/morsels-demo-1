I believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals; but I'll  admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption. \"Really, Holmes,\"  said I severely, \"you are a little trying at times.\"    He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate  answer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted  breakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had  just drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it  up to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and the  flap.    \"It is Porlock's writing,\" said he thoughtfully. \"I can hardly doubt  that it is Porlock's writing, though I have seen it only twice before.  The Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. But if it is  Porlock, then it must be something of the very first importance.\"    He was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation  disappeared in the interest which the words awakened.    \"Who then is Porlock?\" I asked.    \"Porlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere identification mark; but  behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. In a former letter he  frankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me ever  to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city. Porlock is  important, not for himself, but for the great man with whom he is in  touch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark, the jackal  with the lion--anything that is insignificant in companionship with what  is formidable: not only formidable, Watson, but sinister--in the highest  degree sinister. That is where he comes within my purview. You have  heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?\"    \"The famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as--\"    \"My blushes, Watson!\" Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice.    \"I was about to say, as he is unknown to the public.\"    \"A touch! A distinct touch!\" cried Holmes. \"You are developing a certain  unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must learn to  guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel  in the eyes of the law--and there lie the glory and the wonder of it!  The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every deviltry, the  controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made or  marred the destiny of nations--that's the man! But so aloof is he  from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in his  management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have  uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year's pension  as a solatium for his wounded character. Is he not the celebrated author  of The Dynamics of an Asteroid, a book which ascends to such rarefied  heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the  scientific press capable of criticizing it? Is this a man to traduce?  Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor--such would be your  respective roles! That's genius, Watson. But if I am spared by lesser  men, our day will surely come.\"    \"May I be there to see!\" I exclaimed devoutly. \"But you were speaking of  this man Porlock.\"    \"Ah, yes--the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little way  from its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound link--between  ourselves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I have been able  to test it.\"    \"But no chain is stronger than its weakest link.\"    \"Exactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme importance of Porlock. Led  on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right, and encouraged by the  judicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to him by  devious methods, he has once or twice given me advance information which  has been of value--that highest value which anticipates and prevents  rather than avenges crime. I cannot doubt that, if we had the cipher, we  should find that this communication is of the nature that I indicate.\"    Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. I rose and,  leaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which ran as  follows:    534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41 DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE 26  BIRLSTONE 9 47 171    \"What do you make of it, Holmes?\"    \"It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information.\"    \"But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?\"    \"In this instance, none at all.\"    \"Why do you say 'in this instance'?\"    \"Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do the  apocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the intelligence  without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is clearly a reference  to the words in a page of some book. Until I am told which page and  which book I am powerless.\"    \"But why 'Douglas' and 'Birlstone'?\"    \"Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in  question.\"    \"Then why has he not indicated the book?\"    \"Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is  the delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing  cipher and message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are  undone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it.  Our second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it does  not bring us either a further letter of explanation, or, as is more  probable, the very volume to which these figures refer.\"    Holmes's calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the  appearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were  expecting.    \"The same writing,\" remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, \"and  actually signed,\" he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the  epistle. \"Come, we are getting on, Watson.\" His brow clouded, however,  as he glanced over the contents.    \"Dear me, this is very disappointing! I fear, Watson, that all our  expectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come to  no harm.    \"DEAR MR. HOLMES [he says]:    \"I will go no further in this matter. It is too dangerous--he suspects  me. I can see that he suspects me. He came to me quite unexpectedly  after I had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of  sending you the key to the cipher. I was able to cover it up. If he had  seen it, it would have gone hard with me. But I read suspicion in his  eyes. Please burn the cipher message, which can now be of no use to you.    \"FRED PORLOCK.\"    Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his  fingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire.    \"After all,\" he said at last, \"there may be nothing in it. It may be  only his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may have  read the accusation in the other's eyes.\"    \"The other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty.\"    \"No less! When any of that party talk about 'He' you know whom they  mean. There is one predominant 'He' for all of them.\"    \"But what can he do?\"    \"Hum! That's a large question. When you have one of the first brains of  Europe up against you, and all the powers of darkness at his back, there  are infinite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock is evidently scared  out of his senses--kindly compare the writing in the note to that upon  its envelope; which was done, he tells us, before this ill-omened visit.  The one is clear and firm. The other hardly legible.\"    \"Why did he write at all? Why did he not simply drop it?\"    \"Because he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case, and  possibly bring trouble on him.\"    \"No doubt,\" said I. \"Of course.\" I had picked up the original cipher  message and was bending my brows over it. \"It's pretty maddening to  think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper, and  that it is beyond human power to penetrate it.\"    Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the  unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations. \"I  wonder!\" said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. \"Perhaps  there are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. Let us  consider the problem in the light of pure reason. This man's reference  is to a book. That is our point of departure.\"    \"A somewhat vague one.\"    \"Let us see then if we can narrow it down. As I focus my mind upon it,  it seems rather less impenetrable. What indications have we as to this  book?\"    \"None.\"    \"Well, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. The cipher message  begins with a large 534, does it not? We may take it as a working  hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers.  So our book has already become a LARGE book, which is surely something  gained. What other indications have we as to the nature of this large  book? The next sign is C2. What do you make of that, Watson?\"    \"Chapter the second, no doubt.\"    \"Hardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure, agree with me that if the  page be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if  page 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first  one must have been really intolerable.\"    \"Column!\" I cried.    \"Brilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this morning. If it is not  column, then I am very much deceived. So now, you see, we begin to  visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a  considerable length, since one of the words is numbered in the document  as the two hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the limits of what  reason can supply?\"    \"I fear that we have.\"    \"Surely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear  Watson--yet another brain-wave! Had the volume been an unusual one, he  would have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before his  plans were nipped, to send me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#1)"],[1,"University, and Alev Akman              JOHN MARSHALL AND THE CONSTITUTION,    A CHRONICLE OF THE SUPREME COURT      By Edward S.

EPILOGUE         BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE          JOHN MARSHALL AND THE CONSTITUTION        CHAPTER I. The Establishment Of The National Judiciary    The monarch of ancient times mingled the functions of priest and judge.  It is therefore not altogether surprising that even today a judicial  system should be stamped with a certain resemblance to an ecclesiastical  hierarchy. If the Church of the Middle Ages was \"an army encamped on the  soil of Christendom, with its outposts everywhere, subject to the most  efficient discipline, animated with a common purpose, every soldier  panoplied with inviolability and armed with the tremendous weapons which  slew the soul,\" the same words, slightly varied, may be applied to the  Federal Judiciary created by the American Constitution. The Judiciary of  the United States, though numerically not a large body, reaches through  its process every part of the nation; its ascendancy is primarily  a moral one; it is kept in conformity with final authority by the  machinery of appeal; it is \"animated with a common purpose\"; its members  are \"panoplied\" with what is practically a life tenure of their posts;  and it is \"armed with the tremendous weapons\" which slay legislation.  And if the voice of the Church was the voice of God, so the voice of  the Court is the voice of the American people as this is recorded in the  Constitution.    The Hildebrand of American constitutionalism is John Marshall. The  contest carried on by the greatest of the Chief Justices for the  principles today associated with his name is very like that waged by the  greatest of the Popes for the supremacy of the Papacy. Both fought  with intellectual weapons. Both addressed their appeal to the minds and  hearts of men. Both died before the triumph of their respective causes  and amid circumstances of great discouragement. Both worked through and  for great institutions which preceded them and which have survived them.  And, as the achievements of Hildebrand cannot be justly appreciated  without some knowledge of the ecclesiastical system which he did so  much to develop, neither can the career of John Marshall be understood  without some knowledge of the organization of the tribunal through which  he wrought and whose power he did so much to exalt. The first chapter in  the history of John Marshall and his influence upon the laws of the land  must therefore inevitably deal with the historical conditions underlying  the judicial system of which it is the capstone.    The vital defect of the system of government provided by the soon  obsolete Articles of Confederation lay in the fact that it operated not  upon the individual citizens of the United States but upon the States  in their corporate capacities. As a consequence the prescribed duties  of any law passed by Congress in pursuance of powers derived from the  Articles of Confederation could not be enforced. Theoretically, perhaps,  Congress had the right to coerce the States to perform their duties; at  any rate, a Congressional Committee headed by Madison so decided at  the very moment (1781) when the Articles were going into effect. But  practically such a course of coercion, requiring in the end the exercise  of military power, was out of the question. Whence were to come the  forces for military operations against recalcitrant States? From sister  States which had themselves neglected their constitutional duties on  various occasions? The history of the German Empire has demonstrated  that the principle of state coercion is entirely feasible when a  single powerful State dominates the rest of the confederation. But the  Confederation of 1781 possessed no such giant member; it approximated a  union of equals, and in theory it was entirely such. *         * By the Articles of Confederation Congress itself was made       \"the last resort of all disputes and differences...between       two or more States concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any       other cause whatever.\" It was also authorized to appoint       \"courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed on       the high seas\" and \"for receiving and determining finally       appeals in all cases of capture.\" But even before the       Articles had gone into operation, Congress had, as early as       1779, established a tribunal for such appeals, the old Court       of Appeals in Cases of Capture. Thus at the very outset, and       at a time when the doctrine of state sovereignty was       dominant, the practice of appeals from state courts to a       supreme national tribunal was employed, albeit within a       restricted sphere. Yet it is less easy to admit that the       Court of Appeals was, as has been contended by one       distinguished authority, \"not simply the predecessor but one       of the origins of the Supreme Court of the United States.\"       The Supreme Court is the creation of the Constitution       itself; it is the final interpreter of the law in every       field of national power; and its decrees are carried into       effect by the force and authority of the Government of which       it is one of the three coordinate branches. That earlier       tribunal, the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture, was, on       the other hand, a purely legislative creation; its       jurisdiction was confined to a single field, and that of       importance only in time of war; and the enforcement of its       decisions rested with the state governments.      In the Federal Convention of 1787 the idea of state coercion required  little discussion; for the members were soon convinced that it involved  an impracticable, illogical, and unjust principle. The prevailing  view was voiced by Oliver Ellsworth before the Connecticut ratifying  convention: \"We see how necessary for Union is a coercive principle.  No man pretends to the contrary.... The only question is, shall it be  a coercion of law or a coercion of arms? There is no other possible  alternative. Where will those who oppose a coercion of law come out?...  A necessary consequence of their principles is a war of the States one  against the other. I am for coercion by law, that coercion which acts  only upon delinquent individuals.\" If anything, these words somewhat  exaggerate the immunity of the States from direct control by the  National Government, for, as James Madison pointed out in the  \"Federalist,\" \"in several cases... they [the States] must be viewed and  proceeded against in their collective capacities.\" Yet Ellsworth stated  correctly the controlling principle of the new government: it was to  operate upon individuals through laws interpreted and enforced by its  own courts.    A Federal Judiciary was provided for in every Plan offered on the floor  of the Federal Convention. There was also a fairly general agreement  among the members on the question of \"judicial independence.\" Indeed,  most of the state constitutions already made the tenure of the principal  judges dependent upon their good behavior, though in some cases judges  were removable, as in England, upon the joint address of the two  Houses of the Legislature. That the Federal judges should be similarly  removable by the President upon the application of the Senate and House  of Representatives was proposed late in the Convention by Dickinson of  Delaware, but the suggestion received the vote of only one State. In the  end it was all but unanimously agreed that the Federal judges should be  removable only upon conviction following impeachment.    But, while the Convention was in accord on this matter, another  question, that of the organization of the new judiciary, evoked the  sharpest disagreement among its members. All believed that there must  be a national Supreme Court to impress upon the national statutes a  construction that should be uniformly binding throughout the country;  but they disagreed upon the question whether there should be inferior  national courts. Rutledge of South Carolina wanted the state courts to  be used as national courts of the first instance and argued that a right  of appeal to the supreme national tribunal would be quite sufficient  \"to secure the national rights and uniformity of judgment.\" But  Madison pointed out that such an arrangement would cause appeals to be  multiplied most oppressively and that, furthermore, it would provide  no remedy for improper verdicts resulting from local prejudices. A  compromise was reached by leaving the question to the discretion  of Congress. The champions of local liberties, however, both at  Philadelphia and in the state conventions continued to the end to urge  that Congress should utilize the state courts as national tribunals of  the first instance. The significance of this plea should be emphasized  because the time was to come when the same interest would argue that for  the Supreme Court to take appeals from the state courts on any account  was a humiliation to the latter and an utter disparagement of State  Rights.    Even more important than the relation of the Supreme Court to the  judicial systems of the States was the question of its relation to the  Constitution as a governing instrument. Though the idea that courts were  entitled to pronounce on the constitutionality of legislative acts had  received countenance in a few dicta in some of the States and perhaps in  one or two decisions, this idea was still at best in 1787 but the germ  of a possible institution. It is not surprising,"]]]
