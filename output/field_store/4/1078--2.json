Fitch and Dennis G. Rainey      _Introduction_    The eastern woodrat exerts important effects on its community associates  by its use of the vegetation for food, by providing shelter in its stick  houses for many other small animals, and by providing a food supply for  certain flesh-eaters. In the course of our observations on this rodent  on the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation, extending over  an eight-year period, from February, 1948, to February, 1956, these  effects have changed greatly as the population of woodrats has  constantly changed in density, and in extent of the area occupied.    This report is concerned with the population of woodrats on the  Reservation, the changes that the species has undergone, and the factors  that have affected it. Our two sets of field data, used as a basis for  this report, supplement each other and overlap little, either in time or  space. Fitch's field work which covered approximately the western half  of the Reservation, was begun in September, 1948, and was pursued most  intensively in the autumn of 1948 and in 1949, with relatively small  amounts of data obtained in 1950 and 1951 because of the great reduction  in numbers of rats. Rainey's field work began in the spring of 1951 and  was continued through 1954, concentrating on a colony in the extreme  northwestern corner of the Reservation and on adjacent privately owned  land. In actual numbers of rats live-trapped and for total number of  records the two sets of data are comparable. Fitch's field work  consisted chiefly of live-trapping while Rainey's relied also upon  various other approaches to the woodrat's ecology. Rainey's findings  were incorporated originally in a more comprehensive report (1956), from  which short passages have been extracted that are most pertinent to the  present discussion. Our combined data represent 258 woodrats (153  Fitch's and 105 Rainey's) caught a total of 1110 times (660 Rainey's and  450 Fitch's). Rainey's records pertain, in part, to woodrats outside the  Reservation but within a few hundred yards, at most, of its boundaries.      _Habitat_    In the autumn of 1948 the population of woodrats was far below the level  it had attained in 1947 or earlier, but the rats were still abundant and  distributed throughout a variety of habitats. Almost every part of the  woodland was occupied by at least a sparse population. Also, many rats  lived beyond the limits of the woodland proper, in such places as  deserted buildings, thickets, roadside hedges, and tangles of exposed  tree roots along cut banks of gullies. All these situations are  characterized by providing abundant cover, a limiting factor for this  woodrat.    In 1947, when the population of woodrats was especially high, plant  succession on the wooded parts of the Reservation may have been near the  optimum stage for the rats. For some 80 years, since the time the land  was first settled and prairie fires were brought under control, woody  vegetation has been encroaching into areas that were formerly grassland.    About 1934 the University changed its policy with regard to treatment of  the tract that was later made the Reservation. Up to that time, most of  the area had been used as pasture and subjected to heavy grazing, but  several fields had been fenced and cultivated. Under the new policy the  hillsides and hilltop edges with open stands of various deciduous trees  were enclosed with stock fences and protected from grazing. Successional  trends were greatly altered. Woody vegetation, already favored by  protection from the prairie fires originally important in the ecology of  this region underwent further development as a result of protection from  browsing. Thickets of shrubs and saplings sprang up throughout the  woodland, forming a dense understory layer beneath the discontinuous  canopy of the relatively scattered mature trees. The composition and  density of the undergrowth varied markedly in different parts of the  woodland. The parts that were formerly most open acquired the most dense  understory. Blackberry, honey locust, osage orange, and prickly ash  formed in places thorny tangles almost impenetrable to humans. This  thicket stage reached its peak in density in the middle to late forties  coinciding approximately with the time of maximum abundance of the rats.  In the past eight years, under continued protection from burning,  cutting and browsing, the forest has developed further; sizable trees 20  feet or more high and up to eight inches in trunk diameter have grown  from seedlings during the period of protection. An almost continuous  canopy of foliage has developed, shading the understory and thinning it  by killing shrubs and saplings. In those situations where the canopy is  most dense, as on north slopes having stands of young hickory averaging  twenty feet high, the understory is now largely lacking, but in other  situations, particularly on south slopes, the understory thickets are  still dense. On the whole, however, habitat conditions have become less  favorable for the woodrat.    Within the woodland the population of woodrats was not evenly  distributed even at its maximum density; only those situations that  provided sufficient overhead shelter were occupied by woodrats. The  hilltop limestone outcrop, which was the refugium of the survivors when  the population was at low ebb, also supported the greatest concentration  when the population was high. The number of individuals living along any  particular stretch of ledge could be determined only by intensive  live-trapping, whereas residences of individuals could be more readily  identified in most other situations away from the ledge. Stick houses of  woodrats are, characteristically, large and dome-shaped in woodland, but  along the ledges they usually lacked this typical form and consisted of  a much smaller accumulation of sticks, often merely filling a small  crevice. Sticks carried into such places where they were partly or  wholly protected from moisture and sunshine were much less subject to  decay than those in more open situations, and remained long after the  rats themselves were gone. Accumulations of droppings in depressions in  rock surfaces beneath overhanging ledges likewise have lasted for many  years. The rock outcrop provided a continuous travelway along the  hilltops, and even parts that were not permanently occupied usually had  some sign. The following types of situations were found to be especially  favorable for occupancy: deep crevices beneath overhanging projections  of the ledge; large flat boulders broken away from the main ledge; thick  clumps of brush (usually fragrant sumac, _Rhus trilobata_) providing  shelter and support for the house; logs fallen across the ledge  providing support and protection for the house structure.    A second outcropping limestone stratum approximately 20 feet below the  level of the hilltop was just as extensive as the upper outcrop, but it  was little used by the rats because the exposed rock surface was more  regular, lacking the jagged cracks and deep fissures of the hilltop  outcrop; and it lacked the overhanging projections which provided  overhead shelter for the rats along the upper outcrop. More than ninety  per cent of the rats that were recorded as associated with the outcrops  were at the hilltop stratum.    Second in preference to the hilltop outcrop as a house site was the base  of an osage orange tree in thick woods. This tree occurs throughout the  woodland of the Reservation, having become established when the leaf  canopy was more open, and the whole area was subject to grazing, with  less development of the understory vegetation in the woodland. Houses  were most often situated in those osage orange trees that had been cut  one or more times, and had regenerated with spreading growth form, the  multiple branching stems offering substantial support. Occasionally  houses were built in crotches from two to six feet above ground.    Blackberry thickets also are favorable locations for houses. These  thickets grew up mostly in fenced areas from which livestock were  excluded, but where there was not dense shade--hilltop edges and level  or gently sloping ground adjacent to creek banks. The houses were  usually in densest parts of the thickets where they were almost  inaccessible. Mats of dead canes more or less horizontal, with the live  canes growing up through them, provided effective overhead protection,  while the ground beneath was relatively open. Houses built in the  thickets were so well concealed that they were usually not detected  until after leaves were shed in autumn. In most cases the blackberry  thickets were small and well isolated. Houses of the rats were sometimes  unusually near together suggesting that these thickets provided  especially favorable habitat conditions.    Hollow trees are often utilized, the accumulation of sticks for the  house being largely inside the cavity. To be suitable for a house site,  the snag must have an opening near ground level, and another higher on  the trunk, providing emergency outlets in two directions. Most of the  hollow trees utilized were black oaks (_Quercus velutina_)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33574"],[0,"A Field Study of the Kansas Ant-Eating Frog, Gastrophryne olivacea (#1)"],[1,"Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net            Transcriber's Notes    In this Plain Text version of the book, italic typeface is represented  with _underscores_, and small capital typeface is represented in UPPER  case.

Fitch      INTRODUCTION    The ant-eating frog is one of the smallest species of vertebrates on the  University of Kansas Natural History Reservation, but individually it is  one of the most numerous. The species is important in the over-all  ecology; its biomass often exceeds that of larger species of  vertebrates. Because of secretive and subterranean habits, however, its  abundance and effects on community associates are largely obscured.    The Reservation, where my field study was made, is the most northeastern  section in Douglas County, Kansas, and is approximately 5-1/2 miles north  and 2-1/2 miles east of the University campus at Lawrence. The locality  represents one of the northernmost occurrences of the species, genus,  and family. The family Microhylidae is a large one, and most of its  representatives are specialized for a subterranean existence and a diet  of termites or ants. The many subfamilies of microhylids all have  distributions centering in the regions bordering the Indian Ocean, from  South Africa and Madagascar to the East Indies, New Guinea, and  Australia (Parker, 1934). Only one subfamily, the Microhylinae, is  represented in the New World, where it has some 17 genera (de Carvalho,  1954) nearly all of which are tropical. _G. olivacea_, extending north  into extreme southern Nebraska (Loomis, 1945: 211), ranges farther north  than any other American species. In the Old World only _Kaloula  borealis_ has a comparable northward distribution. Occurring in the  vicinity of Peiping (Pope, 1931: 587), it reaches approximately the same  latitude as does _Gastrophryne_ in Nebraska. The great majority of  microhylid genera and species are confined to the tropics.    Nearly all ant-eating frogs seen on the Reservation have been caught and  examined and individually marked. By November 1, 1954, 1215 individuals  had been recorded with a total of 1472 captures. In the summer of 1950,  Richard Freiburg studied this frog on the Reservation and his findings  (1951) led to a better understanding of its natural history. The  numbers of frogs studied by him however, were relatively small and the  field work was limited to the one summer. The data now at hand,  representing six consecutive years, 1949 through 1954, serve to  supplement those obtained by Freiburg, corroborating and extending his  conclusions in most instances, and also indicating that certain of his  tentative conclusions need to be revised.    While the present report was in preparation, Anderson (1954) published  an excellent account of the ecology of the eastern species _G.  carolinensis_ in southern Louisiana. Anderson's findings concerning this  closely related species in a much different environment have been  especially valuable as a basis for comparison. The two species are  basically similar in their habits and ecology but many minor differences  are indicated. Some of these differences result from the differing  environments where Anderson's study and my own were made and others  certainly result from innate genetic differences between the species.    The frog with which this report is concerned is the _Microhyla  carolinensis olivacea_ of the check list (Schmidt, 1953: 77) and recent  authors. De Carvalho (1954: 12) resurrected the generic name,  _Gastrophryne_, for the American species formerly included in  _Microhyla_, and presented seemingly valid morphological evidence for  this plausible generic separation.    _G. olivacea_ is obviously closely related to _G. carolinensis_; the  differences are not greater than those to be expected between well  marked subspecies. Nevertheless, in eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas,  where the ranges meet, the two kinds have been found to maintain their  distinctness, differing in coloration, behavior, calls, and time of  breeding. Hecht and Matalas (1946: 2) found seeming intergrades from the  area of overlapping in eastern Texas, but some specimens from this same  area were typical of each form. Their study was limited to preserved  material, in which some characters probably were obscured. More field  work throughout the zone of contact is needed. The evidence of  intergradation obtained so far seems to be somewhat equivocal.    Besides _G. olivacea_ and typical _G. carolinensis_ there are several  named forms in the genus, including some of doubtful status. The name  _mazatlanensis_ has been applied to a southwestern population, which  seems to be a well marked subspecies of _olivacea_, but as yet  _mazatlanensis_ has been collected at few localities and the evidence of  intergradation is meager. The names _areolata_ and _texensis_ have been  applied to populations in Texas. Hecht and Matalas (1946: 3) consider  _areolata_ to be a synonym of _olivacea_, applied to a population  showing intergradation with _carolinensis_, but Wright and Wright (1949:  568) consider _areolata_ to be a distinct subspecies. _G. texensis_  generally has been considered to be a synonym of _olivacea_. Other  species of the genus include the tropical _G. usta_, _G. elegans_ and  _G. pictiventris_.    Of the vernacular names hitherto applied to _G. olivacea_ none seems  appropriate; I propose to call the species the Kansas ant-eating frog  because of its range extending over most of the state, and because of  its specialized food habits. The type locality, originally stated to be  \"Kansas and Nebraska\" (Hallowell, 1856: 252) has been restricted to Fort  Riley, Kansas (Smith and Taylor, 1950: 358). Members of the genus have  most often been referred to as toads rather than frogs because of their  more toadlike appearance and habits. However, this family belongs to the  firmisternial or froglike division of the Salientia and the terms \"frog\"  and \"toad,\" originally applied to _Rana_ and _Bufo_ respectively, have  been extended to include assemblages of related genera or families.  Members of the genus and family usually have been called  \"narrow-mouthed\" toads from the old generic name _Engystoma_, a synonym  of _Gastrophryne_. _G. olivacea_ usually has been referred to as the  Texas narrow-mouthed toad, or western narrow-mouthed toad. The latter  name is inappropriate because the geographic range is between that of a  more western representative (_mazatlanensis_) and a more eastern one  (_carolinensis_). The names _texensis_, _areolata_ and _carolinensis_  have all been applied to populations in Texas, and it is questionable  whether typical _olivacea_ even extends into Texas.      HABITAT    In the northeastern part of Kansas at least, rocky slopes in open woods  seem to provide optimum habitat conditions. This type of habitat has  been described by several earlier workers in this same area, Dice (1923:  46), Smith (1934: 503) and Freiburg (1951: 375). Smith (1950: 113)  stated that in Kansas this frog is found in wooded areas, and that rocks  are the usual cover, but he mentioned that outside of Kansas it is often  found in mesquite flats that are devoid of rocks. Freiburg's field work  was done almost entirely on the Reservation and was concentrated in  \"Skink Woods\" and vicinity, where much of my own field work, both before  and afterward, was concentrated. On the Reservation and in nearby  counties of Kansas, the habitat preferences of the ant-eating frog and  the five-lined skink largely coincide. In an account of the five-lined  skink on the Reservation, I have described several study areas in some  detail (Fitch, 1954: 37-41). It was on these same study areas (Quarry,  Skink Woods, Rat Woods) that most of the frogs were obtained.    Although _G. olivacea_ thrives in an open-woodland habitat in this part  of its range, it seems to be essentially a grassland species, and it  occurs throughout approximately the southern half of the Great Plains  region. Bragg (1943: 76) emphasized that in Oklahoma it is widely  distributed over the state, occupying a variety of habitats, with little  ecological restriction. Bragg noted, however, that the species is"]]]
