Illustrated by KOSSIN          _If it was good enough for your grandfather, forget it ... it is      much too good for anyone else!_      Gramps Ford, his chin resting on his hands, his hands on the crook of  his cane, was staring irascibly at the five-foot television screen that  dominated the room. On the screen, a news commentator was summarizing  the day's happenings. Every thirty seconds or so, Gramps would jab the  floor with his cane-tip and shout, \"Hell, we did that a hundred years  ago!\"    Emerald and Lou, coming in from the balcony, where they had been seeking  that 2185 A.D. rarity--privacy--were obliged to take seats in the back  row, behind Lou's father and mother, brother and sister-in-law, son and  daughter-in-law, grandson and wife, granddaughter and husband,  great-grandson and wife, nephew and wife, grandnephew and wife,  great-grandniece and husband, great-grandnephew and wife--and, of  course, Gramps, who was in front of everybody. All save Gramps, who was  somewhat withered and bent, seemed, by pre-anti-gerasone standards, to  be about the same age--somewhere in their late twenties or early  thirties. Gramps looked older because he had already reached 70 when  anti-gerasone was invented. He had not aged in the 102 years since.    \"Meanwhile,\" the commentator was saying, \"Council Bluffs, Iowa, was  still threatened by stark tragedy. But 200 weary rescue workers have  refused to give up hope, and continue to dig in an effort to save Elbert  Haggedorn, 183, who has been wedged for two days in a ...\"    \"I wish he'd get something more cheerful,\" Emerald whispered to Lou.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Silence!\" cried Gramps. \"Next one shoots off his big bazoo while the  TV's on is gonna find hisself cut off without a dollar--\" his voice  suddenly softened and sweetened--\"when they wave that checkered flag at  the Indianapolis Speedway, and old Gramps gets ready for the Big Trip Up  Yonder.\"    He sniffed sentimentally, while his heirs concentrated desperately on  not making the slightest sound. For them, the poignancy of the  prospective Big Trip had been dulled somewhat, through having been  mentioned by Gramps about once a day for fifty years.    \"Dr. Brainard Keyes Bullard,\" continued the commentator, \"President of  Wyandotte College, said in an address tonight that most of the world's  ills can be traced to the fact that Man's knowledge of himself has not  kept pace with his knowledge of the physical world.\"    \"_Hell!_\" snorted Gramps. \"We said _that_ a hundred years ago!\"    \"In Chicago tonight,\" the commentator went on, \"a special celebration is  taking place in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital. The guest of honor  is Lowell W. Hitz, age zero. Hitz, born this morning, is the  twenty-five-millionth child to be born in the hospital.\" The commentator  faded, and was replaced on the screen by young Hitz, who squalled  furiously.    \"Hell!\" whispered Lou to Emerald. \"We said that a hundred years ago.\"    \"I heard that!\" shouted Gramps. He snapped off the television set and  his petrified descendants stared silently at the screen. \"You, there,  boy--\"    \"I didn't mean anything by it, sir,\" said Lou, aged 103.    \"Get me my will. You know where it is. You kids _all_ know where it is.  Fetch, boy!\" Gramps snapped his gnarled fingers sharply.    Lou nodded dully and found himself going down the hall, picking his way  over bedding to Gramps' room, the only private room in the Ford  apartment. The other rooms were the bathroom, the living room and the  wide windowless hallway, which was originally intended to serve as a  dining area, and which had a kitchenette in one end. Six mattresses and  four sleeping bags were dispersed in the hallway and living room, and  the daybed, in the living room, accommodated the eleventh couple, the  favorites of the moment.    On Gramps' bureau was his will, smeared, dog-eared, perforated and  blotched with hundreds of additions, deletions, accusations, conditions,  warnings, advice and homely philosophy. The document was, Lou reflected,  a fifty-year diary, all jammed onto two sheets--a garbled, illegible log  of day after day of strife. This day, Lou would be disinherited for the  eleventh time, and it would take him perhaps six months of impeccable  behavior to regain the promise of a share in the estate. To say nothing  of the daybed in the living room for Em and himself.    \"Boy!\" called Gramps.    \"Coming, sir.\" Lou hurried back into the living room and handed Gramps  the will.    \"Pen!\" said Gramps.           *       *       *       *       *    He was instantly offered eleven pens, one from each couple.    \"Not _that_ leaky thing,\" he said, brushing Lou's pen aside. \"Ah,  _there's_ a nice one. Good boy, Willy.\" He accepted Willy's pen. That  was the tip they had all been waiting for. Willy, then--Lou's  father--was the new favorite.    Willy, who looked almost as young as Lou, though he was 142, did a poor  job of concealing his pleasure. He glanced shyly at the daybed, which  would become his, and from which Lou and Emerald would have to move back  into the hall, back to the worst spot of all by the bathroom door.    Gramps missed none of the high drama he had authored and he gave his own  familiar role everything he had. Frowning and running his finger along  each line, as though he were seeing the will for the first time, he read  aloud in a deep portentous monotone, like a bass note on a cathedral  organ.    [Illustration]    \"I, Harold D. Ford, residing in Building 257 of Alden Village, New York  City, Connecticut, do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my  last Will and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and  codicils by me at any time heretofore made.\" He blew his nose  importantly and went on, not missing a word, and repeating many for  emphasis--repeating in particular his ever-more-elaborate specifications  for a funeral.    At the end of these specifications, Gramps was so choked with emotion  that Lou thought he might have forgotten why he'd brought out the will  in the first place. But Gramps heroically brought his powerful emotions  under control and, after erasing for a full minute, began to write and  speak at the same time. Lou could have spoken his lines for him, he had  heard them so often.    \"I have had many heartbreaks ere leaving this vale of tears for a better  land,\" Gramps said and wrote. \"But the deepest hurt of all has been  dealt me by--\" He looked around the group, trying to remember who the  malefactor was.    Everyone looked helpfully at Lou, who held up his hand resignedly.    Gramps nodded, remembering, and completed the sentence--\"my  great-grandson, Louis J. Ford.\"    \"Grandson, sir,\" said Lou.    \"Don't quibble. You're in deep enough now, young man,\" said Gramps, but  he made the change. And, from there, he went without a misstep through  the phrasing of the disinheritance, causes for which were  disrespectfulness and quibbling.           *       *       *       *       *    In the paragraph following, the paragraph that had belonged to everyone  in the room at one time or another, Lou's name was scratched out and  Willy's substituted as heir to the apartment and, the biggest plum of  all, the double bed in the private bedroom.    \"So!\" said Gramps, beaming. He erased the date at the foot of the will  and substituted a new one, including the time of day. \"Well--time to  watch the McGarvey Family.\" The McGarvey Family was a television serial  that Gramps had been following since he was 60, or for a total of 112  years. \"I can't wait to see what's going to happen next,\" he said.    Lou detached himself from the group and lay down on his bed of pain by  the bathroom door. Wishing Em would join him, he wondered where she was.    He dozed for a few moments, until he was disturbed by someone stepping  over him to get into the bathroom. A moment later, he heard a faint  gurgling sound, as though something were being poured down the washbasin  drain. Suddenly, it entered his mind that Em had cracked up, that she  was in there doing something drastic about Gramps.    \"Em?\" he whispered through the panel. There was no reply, and Lou  pressed against the door. The worn lock, whose bolt barely engaged its  socket, held for a second, then let the door swing inward.    \"Morty!\" gasped Lou.    Lou's great-grandnephew, Mortimer, who had just married and brought his  wife home to the Ford menage, looked at Lou with consternation and  surprise. Morty kicked the door shut, but not before Lou had glimpsed  what was in his hand--Gramps' enormous economy-size bottle of  anti-gerasone, which had apparently been half-emptied, and which Morty  was refilling with tap water.    A moment later, Morty came out, glared defiantly at Lou and brushed past  him wordlessly to rejoin his pretty bride.    Shocked, Lou didn't know what to do. He couldn't let Gramps take the  mousetrapped anti-gerasone--but, if he warned Gramps about it, Gramps  would certainly make life in the apartment, which was merely  insufferable now, harrowing.    Lou glanced into the living room and saw that the Fords, Emerald among  them, were momentarily at rest, relishing the botches that the McGarveys  had made of _their_ lives. Stealthily, he went into the bathroom, locked  the door as well as he could and began to pour the contents of Gramps'  bottle down the drain. He was going to refill it with full-strength  anti-gerasone from the 22 smaller bottles on the shelf.    The bottle contained a half-gallon, and its neck was small, so it seemed  to Lou that the emptying would take forever. And the almost  imperceptible smell of anti-gerasone, like Worcestershire sauce, now  seemed to Lou, in his nervousness, to be pouring out into the rest of  the apartment, through the keyhole and under the door.           *       *       *       *       *    The bottle gurgled monotonously.

Heretofore I have made the most of  every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came  under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and  giving the wild creatures credit for more \"sense\" than they really  possessed. The nature lover is always tempted to do this very thing;  his tendency is to humanize the wild life about him, and to read his  own traits and moods into whatever he looks upon. I have never  consciously done this myself, at least to the extent of willfully  misleading my reader. But some of our later nature writers have been  guilty of this fault, and have so grossly exaggerated and  misrepresented the every-day wild life of our fields and woods that  their example has caused a strong reaction to take place in my own  mind, and has led me to set about examining the whole subject of  animal life and instinct in a way I have never done before.    In March, 1903, I contributed to \"The Atlantic Monthly\" a paper called  \"Real and Sham Natural History,\" which was as vigorous a protest as I  could make against the growing tendency to humanize the lower  animals. The paper was widely read and discussed, and bore fruit in  many ways, much of it good and wholesome fruit, but a little of it  bitter and acrid. For obvious reasons that paper is not included in  this collection. But I have given all the essays that were the outcome  of the currents of thought and inquiry that it set going in my mind,  and I have given them nearly in the order in which they were written,  so that the reader may see the growth of my own mind and opinions in  relation to the subject. I confess I have not been fully able to  persuade myself that the lower animals ever show anything more than a  faint gleam of what we call thought and reflection,--the power to  evolve ideas from sense impressions,--except feebly in the case of the  dog and the apes, and possibly the elephant. Nearly all the animal  behavior that the credulous public looks upon as the outcome of reason  is simply the result of the adaptiveness and plasticity of instinct.  The animal has impulses and impressions where we have ideas and  concepts. Of our faculties I concede to them perception, sense memory,  and association of memories, and little else. Without these it would  be impossible for their lives to go on.    I am aware that there is much repetition in this volume, and that the  names of several of the separate chapters differ much more than do the  subjects discussed in them.    When I was a boy on the farm, we used to thrash our grain with the  hand-flail. Our custom was to thrash a flooring of sheaves on one side,  then turn the sheaves over and thrash them on the other, then unbind  them and thrash the loosened straw again, and then finish by turning  the whole over and thrashing it once more. I suspect my reader will  feel that I have followed the same method in many of these papers. I  have thrashed the same straw several times, but I have turned it each  time, and I trust have been rewarded by a few additional grains of truth.    Let me hope that the result of the discussion or thrashing will not be to  make the reader love the animals less, but rather to love the truth more.

One little girl  said: \"I would be pleased if you would write and tell me if birds have  sense. I wanted to see if I couldn't be the first one to know.\" I felt  obliged to reply to the children that we ourselves do not have sense  enough to know just how much sense the birds and other wild creatures  do have, and that they do appear to have some, though their actions  are probably the result of what we call instinct, or natural  prompting, like that of the bean-stalk when it climbs the pole. Yet a  bean-stalk will sometimes show a kind of perversity or depravity that  looks like the result of deliberate choice. Each season, among my  dozen or more hills of pole-beans, there are usually two or three  low-minded plants that will not climb the poles, but go groveling upon  the ground, wandering off among the potato-vines or cucumbers,  departing utterly from the traditions of their race, becoming  shiftless and vagrant. When I lift them up and wind them around the  poles and tie them with a wisp of grass, they rarely stay. In some way  they seem to get a wrong start in life, or else are degenerates from  the first. I have never known anything like this among the wild  creatures, though it happens often enough among our own kind. The  trouble with the bean is doubtless this: the Lima bean is of South  American origin, and in the Southern Hemisphere, beans, it seems, go  the other way around the pole; that is, from right to left. When  transferred north of the equator, it takes them some time to learn the  new way, or from left to right, and a few of them are always  backsliding, or departing from the new way and vaguely seeking the  old; and not finding this, they become vagabonds.    How much or how little sense or judgment our wild neighbors have is  hard to determine. The crows and other birds that carry shell-fish  high in the air and then let them drop upon the rocks to break the  shell show something very much like reason, or a knowledge of the  relation of cause and effect, though it is probably an unthinking  habit formed in their ancestors under the pressure of hunger. Froude  tells of some species of bird that he saw in South Africa flying amid  the swarm of migrating locusts and clipping off the wings of the  insects so that they would drop to the earth, where the birds could  devour them at their leisure. Our squirrels will cut off the chestnut  burs before they have opened, allowing them to fall to the ground,  where, as they seem to know, the burs soon dry open. Feed a caged coon  soiled food,--a piece of bread or meat rolled on the ground,--and  before he eats it he will put it in his dish of water and wash it off.  The author of \"Wild Life Near Home\" says that muskrats \"will wash what  they eat, whether washing is needed or not.\" If the coon washes his  food only when it needs washing, and not in every individual instance,  then the proceeding looks like an act of judgment; the same with the  muskrat. But if they always wash their food, whether soiled or not,  the act looks more like instinct or an inherited habit, the origin of  which is obscure.    Birds and animals probably think without knowing that they think;  that is, they have not self-consciousness. Only man seems to  be endowed with this faculty; he alone develops disinterested  intelligence,--intelligence that is not primarily concerned with his  own safety and well-being, but that looks abroad upon things. The wit  of the lower animals seems all to have been developed by the struggle  for existence, and it rarely gets beyond the prudential stage. The  sharper the struggle, the sharper the wit. Our porcupine, for  instance, is probably the most stupid of animals and has the least  speed; it has little use for either wit or"]]]
