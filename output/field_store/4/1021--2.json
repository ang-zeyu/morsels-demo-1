LONDON, _August_, 1889.                 [Picture: Graphic of three men in a rowing boat]          CHAPTER I.      Three invalids.--Sufferings of George and Harris.--A victim to one  hundred and seven fatal maladies.--Useful prescriptions.--Cure for liver  complaint in children.--We agree that we are overworked, and need  rest.--A week on the rolling deep?--George suggests the  River.--Montmorency lodges an objection.--Original motion carried by  majority of three to one.    There were four of us--George, and William Samuel Harris, and myself, and  Montmorency.  We were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about how  bad we were--bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course.    We were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous about it.  Harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at  times, that he hardly knew what he was doing; and then George said that  _he_ had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what _he_ was doing.  With me, it was my liver that was out of order.  I knew it was my liver  that was out of order, because I had just been reading a patent  liver-pill circular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by which  a man could tell when his liver was out of order.  I had them all.    It is a most extraordinary thing, but I never read a patent medicine  advertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that I am  suffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most  virulent form.  The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly  with all the sensations that I have ever felt.    [Picture: Man reading book] I remember going to the British Museum one  day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had a  touch--hay fever, I fancy it was.  I got down the book, and read all I  came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the  leaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally.  I forget  which was the first distemper I plunged into--some fearful, devastating  scourge, I know--and, before I had glanced half down the list of  \"premonitory symptoms,\" it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.    I sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of  despair, I again turned over the pages.  I came to typhoid fever--read  the symptoms--discovered that I had typhoid fever, must have had it for  months without knowing it--wondered what else I had got; turned up St.  Vitus's Dance--found, as I expected, that I had that too,--began to get  interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so  started alphabetically--read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening for  it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight.  Bright's disease, I was relieved to find, I had only in a modified form,  and, so far as that was concerned, I might live for years.  Cholera I  had, with severe complications; and diphtheria I seemed to have been born  with.  I plodded conscientiously through the twenty-six letters, and the  only malady I could conclude I had not got was housemaid's knee.    I felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to be a sort of  slight.  Why hadn't I got housemaid's knee?  Why this invidious  reservation?  After a while, however, less grasping feelings prevailed.  I reflected that I had every other known malady in the pharmacology, and  I grew less selfish, and determined to do without housemaid's knee.  Gout, in its most malignant stage, it would appear, had seized me without  my being aware of it; and zymosis I had evidently been suffering with  from boyhood.  There were no more diseases after zymosis, so I concluded  there was nothing else the matter with me.    I sat and pondered.  I thought what an interesting case I must be from a  medical point of view, what an acquisition I should be to a class!  Students would have no need to \"walk the hospitals,\" if they had me.  I  was a hospital in myself.  All they need do would be to walk round me,  and, after that, take their diploma.    Then I wondered how long I had to live.  I tried to examine myself.  I  felt my pulse.  I could not at first feel any pulse at all.  Then, all of  a sudden, it seemed to start off.  I pulled out my watch and timed it.  I  made it a hundred and forty-seven to the minute.  I tried to feel my  heart.  I could not feel my heart.  It had stopped beating.  I have since  been induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there all the  time, and must have been beating, but I cannot account for it.  I patted  myself all over my front, from what I call my waist up to my head, and I  went a bit round each side, and a little way up the back.  But I could  not feel or hear anything.  I tried to look at my tongue.  I stuck it out  as far as ever it would go, and I shut one eye, and tried to examine it  with the other.  I could only see the tip, and the only thing that I  could gain from that was to feel more certain than before that I had  scarlet fever.    [Picture: Man with walking stick] I had walked into that reading-room a  happy, healthy man.  I crawled out a decrepit wreck.    I went to my medical man.  He is an old chum of mine, and feels my pulse,  and looks at my tongue, and talks about the weather, all for nothing,  when I fancy I'm ill; so I thought I would do him a good turn by going to  him now.  \"What a doctor wants,\" I said, \"is practice.  He shall have me.  He will get more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your  ordinary, commonplace patients, with only one or two diseases each.\"  So  I went straight up and saw him, and he said:    \"Well, what's the matter with you?\"    I said:    \"I will not take up your time, dear boy, with telling you what is the  matter with me.  Life is brief, and you might pass away before I had  finished.  But I will tell you what is _not_ the matter with me.  I have  not got housemaid's knee.  Why I have not got housemaid's knee, I cannot  tell you; but the fact remains that I have not got it.  Everything else,  however, I _have_ got.\"    And I told him how I came to discover it all.    Then he opened me and looked down me, and clutched hold of my wrist, and  then he hit me over the chest when I wasn't expecting it--a cowardly  thing to do, I call it--and immediately afterwards butted me with the  side of his head.  After that, he sat down and wrote out a prescription,  and folded it up and gave it me, and I put it in my pocket and went out.    I did not open it.  I took it to the nearest chemist's, and handed it in.  The man read it, and then handed it back.    He said he didn't keep it.    I said:    \"You are a chemist?\"    He said:    \"I am a chemist.  If I was a co-operative stores and family hotel  combined, I might be able to oblige you.  Being only a chemist hampers  me.\"    I read the prescription.  It ran:        \"1 lb. beefsteak, with      1 pt. bitter beer                                                                every 6 hours.        1 ten-mile walk every morning.        1 bed at 11 sharp every night.        And don't stuff up your head with things you don't understand.\"        I followed the directions, with the happy result--speaking for  myself--that my life was preserved, and is still going on.    In the present instance, going back to the liver-pill circular, I had the  symptoms, beyond all mistake, the chief among them being \"a general  disinclination to work of any kind.\"    What I suffer in that way no tongue can tell.  From my earliest infancy I  have been a martyr to it.  As a boy, the disease hardly ever left me for  a day.  They did not know, then, that it was my liver.  Medical science  was in a far less advanced state than now, and they used to put it down  to laziness.    \"Why, you skulking little devil, you,\" they would say, \"get up and do  something for your living, can't you?\"--not knowing, of course, that I  was ill.    And they didn't give me pills; they gave me clumps on the side of the  head.  And, strange as it may appear, those clumps on the head often  cured me--for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30802"],[0,"Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by the Posner Memorial Collection  (http://posner.library.cmu.edu/Posner/))                    [Transcriber's Note: Sir William Blackstone's _Commentaries on the  Laws of England_ was first published in 1765-1769.

TO    THE QUEEN'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY,    THE FOLLOWING VIEW    OF THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION    OF ENGLAND,    THE IMPROVEMENT AND PROTECTION OF WHICH    HAVE DISTINGUISHED THE REIGN    OF HER MAJESTY'S ROYAL CONSORT,    IS,    WITH ALL GRATITUDE AND HUMILITY,    MOST RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED    BY HER DUTIFUL    AND MOST OBEDIENT    SERVANT,      WILLIAM BLACKSTONE.          PREFACE.      _THE following sheets contain the substance of a course of lectures on  the laws of England, which were read by the author in the university  of OXFORD. His original plan took it's rise in the year 1753: and,  notwithstanding the novelty of such an attempt in this age and  country, and the prejudices usually conceived against any innovations  in the established mode of education, he had the satisfaction to find  (and he acknowleges it with a mixture of pride and gratitude) that his  endeavours were encouraged and patronized by those, both in the  university and out of it, whose good opinion and esteem he was  principally desirous to obtain._    _THE death of Mr VINER in 1756, and his ample benefaction to the  university for promoting the study of the law, produced about two  years afterwards a regular and public establishment of what the author  had privately undertaken. The knowlege of our laws and constitution  was adopted as a liberal science by general academical authority;  competent endowments were decreed for the support of a lecturer, and  the perpetual encouragement of students; and the compiler of the  ensuing commentaries had the honour to be elected the first Vinerian  professor._    _IN this situation he was led, both by duty and inclination, to  investigate the elements of the law, and the grounds of our civil  polity, with greater assiduity and attention than many have thought it  necessary to do. And yet all, who of late years have attended the  public administration of justice, must be sensible that a masterly  acquaintance with the general spirit of laws and the principles of  universal jurisprudence, combined with an accurate knowlege of our own  municipal constitutions, their original, reason, and history, hath  given a beauty and energy to many modern judicial decisions, with  which our ancestors were wholly unacquainted. If, in the pursuit of  these inquiries, the author hath been able to rectify any errors which  either himself or others may have heretofore imbibed, his pains will  be sufficiently answered: and, if in some points he is still mistaken,  the candid and judicious reader will make due allowances for the  difficulties of a search so new, so extensive, and so laborious._    _THE labour indeed of these researches, and of a regular attention to  his duty, for a series of so many years, he hath found inconsistent  with his health, as well as his other avocations: and hath therefore  desired the university's permission to retire from his office, after  the conclusion of the annual course in which he is at present engaged.  But the hints, which he had collected for the use of his pupils,  having been thought by some of his more experienced friends not wholly  unworthy of the public eye, it is therefore with the less reluctance  that he now commits them to the press: though probably the little  degree of reputation, which their author may have acquired by the  candor of an audience (a test widely different from that of a  deliberate perusal) would have been better consulted by a total  suppression of his lectures;----had that been a matter intirely within  his power._    _FOR the truth is, that the present publication is as much the effect  of necessity, as it is of choice. The notes which were taken by his  hearers, have by some of them (too partial in his favour) been thought  worth revising and transcribing; and these transcripts have been  frequently lent to others. Hence copies have been multiplied, in their  nature imperfect, if not erroneous; some of which have fallen into  mercenary hands, and become the object of clandestine sale. Having  therefore so much reason to apprehend a surreptitious impression, he  chose rather to submit his own errors to the world, than to seem  answerable for those of other men. And, with this apology, he commits  himself to the indulgence of the public._          ERRATA.      _Page 138, line 15_: _for_ no _read_ an    _Page 147, (notes) col. 2._ _after_ 1 Sid. 1. _add_ See Stat. 13 Car.

ON THE STUDY OF THE LAW.[A]    [Footnote A: Read in Oxford at the opening of the Vinerian lectures;  25 Oct. 1758.]      MR VICE-CHANCELLOR, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE UNIVERSITY,    THE general expectation of so numerous and respectable an audience,  the novelty, and (I may add) the importance of the duty required from  this chair, must unavoidably be productive of great diffidence and  apprehensions in him who has the honour to be placed in it. He must be  sensible how much will depend upon his conduct in the infancy of a  study, which is now first adopted by public academical authority;  which has generally been reputed (however unjustly) of a dry and  unfruitful nature; and of which the theoretical, elementary parts have  hitherto received a very moderate share of cultivation. He cannot but  reflect that, if either his plan of instruction be crude and  injudicious, or the execution of it lame and superficial, it will cast  a damp upon the farther progress of this most useful and most rational  branch of learning; and may defeat for a time the public-spirited  design of our wise and munificent benefactor. And this he must more  especially dread, when he feels by experience how unequal his  abilities are (unassisted by preceding examples) to complete, in the  manner he could wish, so extensive and arduous a task; since he freely  confesses, that his former more private attempts have fallen very  short of his own ideas of perfection. And yet the candour he has  already experienced, and this last transcendent mark of regard, his  present nomination by the free and unanimous suffrage of a great and  learned university, (an honour to be ever remembered with the deepest  and most affectionate gratitude) these testimonies of your public  judgment must entirely supersede his own, and forbid him to believe  himself totally insufficient for the labour at least of this  employment. One thing he will venture to hope for, and it certainly  shall be his constant aim, by diligence and attention to atone for his  other defects; esteeming, that the best return, which he can possibly  make for your favourable opinion of his capacity, will be his  unwearied endeavours in some "]]]
