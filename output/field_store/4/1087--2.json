A desire to extend the knowledge of, and by so doing to extend the love  for, those sunny creatures called Butterflies, has prompted the author to  undertake this little work, which, though making no pretence to a  technically scientific character, will, it is hoped, be found sufficiently  complete and accurate to supply all information needful to the young  entomologist as to the names, appearance, habits, localities, &c. of _all  our British Butterflies_, together with a general history of butterfly  life--the mode of capture, preservation, and arrangement in cabinets--the  apparatus required, &c. At the same time it is so inexpensive as to be  accessible to every schoolboy.    The subject is one which has formed the delight and study of the author  from early boyhood, and butterfly-hunting still preserves its fascinations,  redoubling the pleasure of the country ramble in summer. {vi}    Should this volume be the means of inciting some to seek this source of  healthful enjoyment, and to join in the peaceful study which may be so  easily pursued by all dwellers in the country, it will have succeeded in  its purpose.    The whole of the illustrative portraits of the _butterflies_ have been  drawn from nature by the author, and with one exception from specimens in  his own collection. At least one figure of each species (of the natural  size) is given; but in very many instances, where the sexes differ  considerably from each other, both are figured, and the under sides are  also frequently added.    The greater number of the _caterpillars_ and _chrysalides_, however, being  rarely met with, the figures on the first plate are nearly all borrowed  from the splendid and accurate works of Continental authors--chiefly from  Huebner and Duponchel.    With great pleasure, the author here acknowledges his obligations, for many  biographical facts relating to butterflies, to those highly useful  periodicals, the _Zoologist_ and the _Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer_,  the former devoted to general natural history, the latter especially to  entomology, and whose pages register a {vii} mass of interesting and  original communications from correspondents who, living in wide-spread  localities, and possessing varied opportunities of observation, have  gradually brought together, under able editorship, a store of facts that  could never have come within the _personal_ experience of any one man,  however industrious and observant.    The capture during the past year of a new and interesting butterfly for the  first time in this country, is recorded in this volume, in which the insect  is also figured and described.

Occasionally a missive arrives from some benevolent friend, announcing the  capture of a \"splendid butterfly,\" which, imprisoned under a tumbler,  awaits one's acceptance as an addition to the cabinet. However, on going to  claim the proffered prize, the expected \"_butterfly_\" turns out to be some  bright-coloured _moth_ (a Tiger moth being the favourite victim of the  misnomer), and one's entomological propriety suffers a shock; not so much  feeling the loss of the specimen, as concern for the benighted state of an  otherwise intelligent friend's mind with regard to insect nomenclature. {2}    It is clearly therefore _not_ so superfluous as it might at first otherwise  seem, to commence the subject by defining even such a familiar object as a  _butterfly_, and more especially distinguishing it with certainty from a  _moth_, the only other creature with which it can well be confounded.    The usual notion of a butterfly is of a gay fluttering thing, whose broad  painted wings are covered with a mealy stuff that comes off with handling.  This is all very well for a general idea, but the characters that form it  are common to some other insects besides butterflies. Moths and hawk-moths  have mealy wings, and are often gaily coloured too; whilst, on the other  hand, some butterflies are as dusky and plain as possible. Thus the  crimson-winged Tiger, and Cinnabar _moths_ get the name of _butterflies_,  and the Meadow brown _butterfly_ is as sure to be called a _moth_. So, as  neither colouring nor mealy wings furnish us with the required definition,  we must find some concise combination of characters that _will_ answer the  purpose. _Butterflies, then, are insects with mealy wings, and whose horns  (called \"antennae\") have a clubbed or thickened tip, giving them more or  less resemblance to a drum-stick._ So the difference in the shape of the  _antennae_ is the _chief_ outward mark of distinction between butterflies  and moths, the latter having _antennae_ of various shapes, threadlike or  featherlike, but _never clubbed at the tip_.    Having thus settled how a butterfly is to be recognized at sight, let us  see what butterfly _life_ is: how the creature lives, and has lived, in the  stages preceding its present airy form.    [Illustration: I.]    {3}    In like manner with other insects, all butterflies commence their existence  enclosed in minute _eggs_; and these eggs, as if shadowing forth the beauty  yet undeveloped whose germ they contain, are themselves such curiously  beautiful objects, that they must not be passed over without admiring  notice. It seems, indeed, as if nature determined that the ornamental  character of the butterfly should commence with its earliest stage; form,  and not colour, being employed in its decoration, sculpture being here made  the forerunner of painting.    Some of these forms are roughly shown on Plate II. (figs. 1-7), but highly  magnified; for as these eggs are really very tiny structures, such as would  fall easily through a pin-hole, the aid of a microscope is of course  necessary to render visible the delicate sculpture that adorns their  surface. The egg (fig. 1, Plate II.) of the common Garden white butterfly  (_Pieris Brassicae_) is among the most graceful and interesting of these  forms, and also the most easily obtained. It reminds us of some antique  vessel, ribbed and fluted with consummate elegance and regularity.    Others--such as those of the Large Heath butterfly (fig. 3), and the Queen  of Spain Fritillary (fig. 2), simulate curious wicker-work baskets. The  Peacock butterfly has an egg like a polygonal jar (fig. 4), while that of  its near ally, the large Tortoise-shell (fig. 5), is simply pear-shaped,  with the surface unsculptured and smooth {4} (fig. 5). The eggs of the  Meadow Brown (fig. 6), and the Wood Argus (fig. 7), are globular--the  former with lines on its surface like the meridian lines on a geographical  globe, and a pretty scalloping at the top that gives a flower-like  appearance to that portion; the latter has the whole surface honey-combed  with a network of hexagonal cells. Such are a few of the devices that  ornament the earliest cradle of the butterfly; but probably those of every  species would well repay their examination to any one who possesses a  microscope.    Prompted by a most remarkable instinct, and one that could not have  originated in any experience of personal advantage, the female butterfly,  when seeking a depository for her eggs, selects with unerring certainty the  very plant which, of all others, is best fitted for the support of her  offspring, who, when hatched, find themselves surrounded with an abundant  store of their proper food.    Many a young botanist would be puzzled at first sight to tell a sloe-bush  from a buckthorn-bush. Not so, however, with our Brimstone butterfly:  passing by all the juicy hedge-plants, which look quite as suitable, one  would think, she, with botanical acumen, fixes upon the buckthorn; either  the common one, or, if that is not at hand, upon another species of  rhamnus--the berry-bearing alder--which, though a very different looking  plant, is of the same genus, and shares the same properties. She evidently  works out the natural system of botany, and might have been a pupil of  Jussieu, had she not been tutored by a far higher AUTHORITY.    [Illustration: II.]    {5}    This display of instinct would seem far less wonderful did the mother  butterfly herself feed on the plant she commits "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33874"],[0,"Wild Bees, Wasps and Ants and Other Stinging Insects (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by The Internet Archive)            WILD BEES, WASPS AND ANTS    [Illustration: PLATE A.    1. _Formica sanguinea, male._ 2. _Formica sanguinea, female._ 3. _Formica  sanguinea, worker._ 4. _Mutilla europaea, male._ 5. _Mutilla Europaea,  female._ 6. _Cerceris arenaria, female._ 7. _Ammophila sabulosa, female._  8. _Crabro cribrarius, male._ 9. _Odynerus spinipes, male._    [_front._    WILD BEES, WASPS  AND ANTS    And Other Stinging Insects    By    EDWARD SAUNDERS    F.R.S., F.L.S., etc    With numerous Illustrations in the text, and  Four Coloured Plates by  CONSTANCE A.

Of these the  non-scientific public rarely recognizes more than the Hive Bee, the Humble  Bee, the Wasp, and the Hornet, whereas there are about 400 different kinds  to be found in this country, and they can be recognized by any one who is  disposed to make a special study of the group.    The author has not hesitated to make free use of the experiences of others  in regard to the habits of the insects he describes, and he has not thought  it necessary in each case to make separate acknowledgment of this. He takes  this opportunity of thanking Mr. H. Donisthorpe and Mr. F. W. L. Sladen for  assistance in the chapters on Ants and their Lodgers, and Humble Bees,  respectively. {vi}    These pages are written only for the non-scientific, as the scientific  entomologist will be already familiar with the elementary facts recorded;  but it is hoped that they may be of interest to lovers of Nature who wish  to know a little about the insects they see round them and how they spend  their lives. Of this knowledge very little exists, as the scraps which have  been here brought together evidence. There is an immense field open for  research and observation, and the writer of this little book will be very  glad if the following pages should encourage any one to take up the subject  and add to our present scanty stock of information.
