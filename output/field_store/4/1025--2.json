LOCAL DESCRIPTIONS.      Nothing is more idle, and, what is less to be forgiven in a writer, more  tedious, than minute and lengthened descriptions of localities; where it  is very doubtful whether the writers themselves had formed any tolerable  notion of the place they describe,--it is certain their readers never  can! These descriptive passages, in which writers of imagination so  frequently indulge, are usually a glittering confusion of unconnected  things; circumstances recollected from others, or observed by themselves  at different times; the finest are thrust in together. If a scene from  nature, it is possible that all the seasons of the year may be jumbled  together; or if a castle or an apartment, its magnitude or its  minuteness may equally bewilder. Yet we find, even in works of  celebrity, whole pages of these general or these particular descriptive  sketches, which leave nothing behind but noun substantives propped up by  random epithets. The old writers were quite delighted to fill up their  voluminous pages with what was a great saving of sense and thinking. In  the _Alaric_ of Scudery sixteen pages, containing nearly five hundred  verses, describe a palace, commencing at the _facade_, and at length  finishing with the garden; but his description, we may say, was much  better described by Boileau, whose good taste felt the absurdity of this  \"abondance sterile,\" in overloading a work with useless details,      Un auteur, quelquefois, trop plein de son objet,    Jamais sans l'epuiser n'abandonne un sujet.    S'il rencontre un palais il m'en depeint la face,    Il me promene apres de terrasae en terrasse.    Ici s'offre un perron, la regne un corridor;    La ce balcon s'enferme en un balustre d'or;    Il compte les plafonds, les ronds, et les ovales--    Je saute vingt feuillets pour en trouver la fin;    Et je me sauve a peine au travers du jardin!    And then he adds so excellent a canon of criticism, that we must not  neglect it:--      Tout ce qu'on dit de trop est fade et rebutant;    L'esprit rassasie le rejette a l'instant,    Qui ne sait se borner, ne sut jamais ecrire.    We have a memorable instance of the inefficiency of local descriptions  in a very remarkable one by a writer of fine genius, composing with an  extreme fondness of his subject, and curiously anxious to send down to  posterity the most elaborate display of his own villa--this was the  _Laurentinum_ of Pliny. We cannot read his letter to Gallus, which the  English reader may in Melmoth's elegant version,[1] without somewhat  participating in the delight of the writer in many of its details; but  we cannot with the writer form the slightest conception of his villa,  while he is leading us over from apartment to apartment, and pointing to  us the opposite wing, with a \"beyond this,\" and a \"not far from thence,\"  and \"to this apartment another of the same sort,\" &c. Yet, still, as we  were in great want of a correct knowledge of a Roman villa, and as this  must be the most so possible, architects have frequently studied, and  the learned translated with extraordinary care, Pliny's _Description of  his Laurentinum_. It became so favourite an object, that eminent  architects have attempted to raise up this edifice once more, by giving  its plan and elevation; and this extraordinary fact is the result--that  not one of them but has given a representation different from the other!  Montfaucon, a more faithful antiquary, in his close translation of the  description of this villa, in comparing it with Felibien's plan of the  villa itself, observes, \"that the architect accommodated his edifice to  his translation, but that their notions are not the same;  unquestionably,\" he adds, \"if ten skilful translators were to perform  their task separately, there would not be one who agreed with another!\"    If, then, on this subject of local descriptions, we find that it is  impossible to convey exact notions of a real existing scene, what must  we think of those which, in truth, describe scenes which have no other  existence than the confused makings-up of an author's invention; where  the more he details the more he confuses; and where the more particular  he wishes to be, the more indistinct the whole appears?    Local descriptions, after a few striking circumstances have been  selected, admit of no further detail. It is not their length, but their  happiness, which enters into our comprehension; the imagination can only  take in and keep together a very few parts of a picture. The pen must  not intrude on the province of the pencil, any more than the pencil must  attempt to perform what cannot in any shape be submitted to the eye,  though fully to the mind.    The great art, perhaps, of local description, is rather a general than a  particular view; the details must be left to the imagination; it is  suggestion rather than description. There is an old Italian sonnet of  this kind which I have often read with delight; and though I may not  communicate the same pleasure to the reader, yet the story of the writer  is most interesting, and the lady (for such she was) has the highest  claim to be ranked, like the lady of Evelyn,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#1)"],[1,"Juveniles for 1864    PUBLISHED BY  JAMES MILLER,  522 BROADWAY, N.

I am again in my quiet Danish home, but my thoughts are daily in dear  England, where, a few months ago, my many friends transformed for me  reality into a charming story.    Whilst occupied with a greater work, there sprung forth--as the  flowers spring forth in the forest--seven short stories.* I feel a  desire, a longing, to transplant in England the first produce of my  poetic garden, as a Christmas greeting: and I send it to you, my dear,  noble, Charles Dickens, who by your works had been previously dear to  me, and since our meeting have taken root for ever in my heart.    Your hand was the last that pressed mine on England's coast: it was  you who from her shores wafted me the last farewell. It is therefore  natural that I should send to you, from Denmark, my first greeting  again, as sincerely as an affectionate heart can convey it.          Hans Christian Andersen.

In the street, up there, was an old, a very old house,--it was almost  three hundred years old, for that might be known by reading the great  beam on which the date of the year was carved: together with tulips  and hop-binds there were whole verses spelled as in former times, and  over every window was a distorted face cut out in the beam. The one  story stood forward a great way over the other; and directly under the  eaves was a leaden spout with a dragon's head; the rain-water should  have run out of the mouth, but it ran out of the belly, for there was  a hole in the spout.    All the other houses in the street were so new and so neat, with large  window-panes and smooth walls, one could easily see that they would  have nothing to do with the old house: they certainly thought, \"How  long is that old decayed thing to stand here as a spectacle in the  street? And then the protecting windows stand so far out, that no one  can see from our windows what happens in that direction! The steps are  as broad as those of a palace, and as high as to a church tower. The  iron railings look just like the door to an old family vault, and then  they have brass tops,--that's so stupid!\"    On the other side of the street were also new and neat houses, and  they thought just as the others did; but at the window opposite the  old house there sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks and bright  beaming eyes: he certainly liked the old house best, and that both in  sunshine and moonshine. And when he looked across at the wall where  the mortar had fallen out, he could sit and find out there the  strangest figures imaginable; exactly as the street had appeared  before, with steps, projecting windows, and pointed gables; he could  see soldiers with halberds, and spouts where the water ran, like  dragons and serpents. _That_ was a house to look at; and there lived  an old man, who wore plush breeches; and he had a coat with large  brass buttons, and a wig that one could see was a real wig. Every  morning there came an old fellow to him who put his rooms in order,  and went on errands; otherwise, the old man in the plush breeches was  quite alone in the old house. Now and then he came to the window and  looked out, and the little boy nodded to him, and the old man nodded  again, and so they became acquaintances, and then they were friends,  although they had never spoken to each other,--but that made no  difference. The little boy heard his parents say, \"The old man  opposite is very well off, but he is so very, very lonely!\"    The Sunday following, the little boy took something, and wrapped it up  in a piece of paper, went down stairs, and stood in the doorway; and  when the man who went on errands came past, he said to him--    \"I say, master! will you give this to the old man over the way from  me? I have two pewter soldiers--this is one of them, and he shall have  it, for I know he is so very, very lonely.\"    And the old errand man looked quite pleased, nodded, and took the  pewter soldier over to the old house. Afterwards there came a message;  it was to ask if the little boy himself had not a wish to come over  and pay a visit; and so he got permission of his parents, and then  went over to the old house.    And the brass balls on the iron railings shone much brighter than  ever; one would have thought they were polished on account of the  visit; and it was as if the carved-out trumpeters--for there were  trumpeters, who stood in tulips, carved out on the door--blew with all  their might, their cheeks appeared so much rounder than before. Yes,  they blew--\"Trateratra! the little boy comes trateratra!\"--and then  the door opened.    The whole passage was hung with portraits of knights in armor, and  ladies in silken gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silken gowns  rustled! And then there was a flight of stairs which went a good way  upwards, and a little way downwards, and then one came on a balcony  which was in a very dilapidated state, sure enough, with large holes  and long crevices, but grass grew there and leaves out of them  altogether, for the whole balcony outside, the yard, and the walls,  were overgrown with so much green stuff, that it looked like a garden;  but it was only a balcony. Here stood old flower-pots with faces and  asses' ears, and the flowers grew just as they liked. One of the pots  was quite overrun on all sides with pinks, that is to say, with the  green part; shoot stood by shoot, and it said quite distinctly, \"The  air has cherished me, the sun has kissed me, and promised me a little  flower on Sunday!--a little flower on Sunday!\"    And then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered, with  hog's leather, and printed with gold flowers.        \"The gilding decays,      But hog's leather stays!\"    said the walls.    And there stood easy chairs, with such high backs, and so carved out,  and with arms on both sides. \"Sit down! sit down!\" said they. \"Ugh!  how I creak; now I shall certainly get the gout, like the old  clothes-press, ugh!\"    And then the little boy came into the room where the projecting  windows were, and where the old man sat.    \"I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!\" said the old  man, \"and I thank you because you come over to me.\"    \"Thankee! thankee!\" or \"cranky! cranky!\" sounded from all the  furniture; there was so much of it, that each article stood in the  other's way, to get a look at the little boy.    In the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful  lady, so young, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with  clothes that stood quite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she  neither said \"thankee, thankee!\" nor \"cranky, cranky!\" but looked with  her mild eyes at the little boy, who directly asked the old man,  \"Where did you get her?\"    \"Yonder, at the broker's,\" said the old man, \"where there are so many  pictures hanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all  of them buried; but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been  dead and gone these fifty years!\"    Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a _bouquet_ of  withered flowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so  very old!    The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned,  and every thing in the room became still older; but they did not  observe it.    \"They say at home,\" said the little boy, \"that you are so very, very  lonely!\"    \"Oh!\" said he, \"the old thoughts, with what they may bring with them,  come and visit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!\"    Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there  were whole long processions and pageants, with the strangest  characters, which one never sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave  of clubs, and citizens with waving flags: the tailors had theirs, with  a pair of shears held by two lions,--and the shoemakers theirs,  without boots, but with an eagle that had two heads, for the  shoemakers must have everything so that they can say, it is a"]]]
