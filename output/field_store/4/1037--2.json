It was a fair  highway, through the Land of Lost Delight; shadow and sunshine were  blessedly mingled, and every turn and dip revealed a fresh charm and a  new loveliness to eager hearts and unspoiled eyes.    On that road we heard the song of morning stars; we drank in fragrances  aerial and sweet as a May mist; we were rich in gossamer fancies and  iris hopes; our hearts sought and found the boon of dreams; the years  waited beyond and they were very fair; life was a rose-lipped comrade  with purple flowers dripping from her fingers.    We may long have left the golden road behind, but its memories are the  dearest of our eternal possessions; and those who cherish them as such  may haply find a pleasure in the pages of this book, whose people are  pilgrims on the golden road of youth.            THE GOLDEN ROAD          CHAPTER I. A NEW DEPARTURE      \"I've thought of something amusing for the winter,\" I said as we  drew into a half-circle around the glorious wood-fire in Uncle Alec's  kitchen.    It had been a day of wild November wind, closing down into a wet, eerie  twilight. Outside, the wind was shrilling at the windows and around the  eaves, and the rain was playing on the roof. The old willow at the gate  was writhing in the storm and the orchard was a place of weird music,  born of all the tears and fears that haunt the halls of night. But  little we cared for the gloom and the loneliness of the outside world;  we kept them at bay with the light of the fire and the laughter of our  young lips.    We had been having a splendid game of Blind-Man's Buff. That is, it  had been splendid at first; but later the fun went out of it because we  found that Peter was, of malice prepense, allowing himself to be  caught too easily, in order that he might have the pleasure of catching  Felicity--which he never failed to do, no matter how tightly his eyes  were bound. What remarkable goose said that love is blind? Love can see  through five folds of closely-woven muffler with ease!    \"I'm getting tired,\" said Cecily, whose breath was coming rather quickly  and whose pale cheeks had bloomed into scarlet. \"Let's sit down and get  the Story Girl to tell us a story.\"    But as we dropped into our places the Story Girl shot a significant  glance at me which intimated that this was the psychological moment for  introducing the scheme she and I had been secretly developing for some  days. It was really the Story Girl's idea and none of mine. But she had  insisted that I should make the suggestion as coming wholly from myself.    \"If you don't, Felicity won't agree to it. You know yourself, Bev, how  contrary she's been lately over anything I mention. And if she goes  against it Peter will too--the ninny!--and it wouldn't be any fun if we  weren't all in it.\"    \"What is it?\" asked Felicity, drawing her chair slightly away from  Peter's.    \"It is this. Let us get up a newspaper of our own--write it all  ourselves, and have all we do in it. Don't you think we can get a lot of  fun out of it?\"    Everyone looked rather blank and amazed, except the Story Girl. She knew  what she had to do, and she did it.    \"What a silly idea!\" she exclaimed, with a contemptuous toss of her long  brown curls. \"Just as if WE could get up a newspaper!\"    Felicity fired up, exactly as we had hoped.    \"I think it's a splendid idea,\" she said enthusiastically. \"I'd like to  know why we couldn't get up as good a newspaper as they have in town!  Uncle Roger says the Daily Enterprise has gone to the dogs--all the news  it prints is that some old woman has put a shawl on her head and gone  across the road to have tea with another old woman. I guess we could do  better than that. You needn't think, Sara Stanley, that nobody but you  can do anything.\"    \"I think it would be great fun,\" said Peter decidedly. \"My Aunt Jane  helped edit a paper when she was at Queen's Academy, and she said it was  very amusing and helped her a great deal.\"    The Story Girl could hide her delight only by dropping her eyes and  frowning.    \"Bev wants to be editor,\" she said, \"and I don't see how he can, with no  experience. Anyhow, it would be a lot of trouble.\"    \"Some people are so afraid of a little bother,\" retorted Felicity.    \"I think it would be nice,\" said Cecily timidly, \"and none of us have  any experience of being editors, any more than Bev, so that wouldn't  matter.\"    \"Will it be printed?\" asked Dan.    \"Oh, no,\" I said. \"We can't have it printed. We'll just have to write it  out--we can buy foolscap from the teacher.\"    \"I don't think it will be much of a newspaper if it isn't printed,\" said  Dan scornfully.    \"It doesn't matter very much what YOU think,\" said Felicity.    \"Thank you,\" retorted Dan.    \"Of course,\" said the Story Girl hastily, not wishing to have Dan turned  against our project, \"if all the rest of you want it I'll go in for it  too. I daresay it would be real good fun, now that I come to think of  it. And we'll keep the copies, and when we become famous they'll be  quite valuable.\"    \"I wonder if any of us ever will be famous,\" said Felix.    \"The Story Girl will be,\" I said.    \"I don't see how she can be,\" said Felicity skeptically. \"Why, she's  just one of us.\"    \"Well, it's decided, then, that we're to have a newspaper,\" I resumed  briskly. \"The next thing is to choose a name for it. That's a very  important thing.\"    \"How often are you going to publish it?\" asked Felix.    \"Once a month.\"    \"I thought newspapers came out every day, or every week at least,\" said  Dan.    \"We couldn't have one every week,\" I explained. \"It would be too much  work.\"    \"Well, that's an argument,\" admitted Dan. \"The less work you can get  along with the better, in my opinion. No, Felicity, you needn't say it.  I know exactly what you want to say, so save your breath to cool your  porridge. I agree with you that I never work if I can find anything else  to do.\"          \"'Remember it is harder still        To have no work to do,\"'      quoted Cecily reprovingly.    \"I don't believe THAT,\" rejoined Dan. \"I'm like the Irishman who said he  wished the man who begun work had stayed and finished it.\"    \"Well, is it decided that Bev is to be editor?\" asked Felix.    \"Of course it is,\" Felicity answered for everybody.    \"Then,\" said Felix, \"I move that the name be The King Monthly Magazine.\"    \"That sounds fine,\" said Peter, hitching his chair a little nearer  Felicity's.    \"But,\" said Cecily timidly, \"that will leave out Peter and the Story  Girl and Sara Ray, just as if they didn't have a share in it. I don't  think that would be fair.\"    \"You name it then, Cecily,\" I suggested.    \"Oh!\" Cecily threw a deprecating glance at the Story Girl and Felicity.  Then, meeting the contempt in the latter's gaze, she raised her head  with unusual spirit.    \"I think it would be nice just to call it Our Magazine,\" she said. \"Then  we'd all feel as if we had a share in it.\"    \"Our Magazine it will be, then,\" I said. \"And as for having a share in  it, you bet we'll all have a share in it. If I'm to be editor you'll all  have to be sub-editors, and have charge of a department.\"    \"Oh, I couldn't,\" protested Cecily.    \"You must,\" I said inexorably. \"'England expects everyone to do his  duty.' That's our motto--only we'll put Prince Edward Island in place of  England. There must be no shirking. Now, what departments will we have?  We must make it as much like a real newspaper as we can.\"    \"Well, we ought to have an etiquette department, then,\" said Felicity.  \"The Family Guide has one.\"    \"Of course we'll have one,\" I said, \"and Dan will edit it.\"    \"Dan!\" exclaimed Felicity, who had fondly expected to be asked to edit  it herself.    \"I can run an etiquette column as well as that idiot in the Family  Guide, anyhow,\" said Dan defiantly. \"But you can't have an etiquette  department unless questions are asked. What am I to do if nobody asks  any?\"    \"You must make some up,\" said the Story Girl. \"Uncle Roger says that is  what the Family Guide man does. He says it is impossible that there can  be as many hopeless fools in the world as that column would stand for  otherwise.\"    \"We want you to edit the household department, Felicity,\" I said, seeing  a cloud lowering on that fair lady's brow. \"Nobody can do that as well  as you. Felix will edit the jokes and the Information Bureau, and Cecily  must be fashion editor. Yes, you must, Sis. It's easy as wink. And the  Story Girl will attend to the personals. They're very important. Anyone  can contribute a personal, but the Story Girl is to see there are some  in every issue, even if she has to make them up, like Dan with the  etiquette.\"    \"Bev will run the scrap book department, besides the editorials,\" said  the Story Girl, seeing that I was too modest to say it myself.    \"Aren't you going to have a story page?\" asked Peter.    \"We will, if you'll be fiction and poetry editor,\" I said.    Peter, in his secret soul, was dismayed, but he would not blanch before  Felicity.    \"All right,\" he said, recklessly.    \"We can put anything we like in the scrap book department,\" I explained,  \"but all the other contributions must be original, and all must have the  name of the writer signed to them, except the personals. We must all do  our best. Our Magazine is to be 'a feast of reason and flow of soul.\"'    I felt that I had worked in two quotations with striking effect. The  others, with the exception of the Story Girl, looked suitably impressed.    \"But,\" said"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31619"],[0,"The Planet Savers (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from Amazing Stories, November, 1958.

She has been away from our pages too long. So this      story is in the nature of a triumphant return. It could well be her      best to date._      By the time I got myself all the way awake I thought I was alone. I was  lying on a leather couch in a bare white room with huge windows,  alternate glass-brick and clear glass. Beyond the clear windows was a  view of snow-peaked mountains which turned to pale shadows in the  glass-brick.    Habit and memory fitted names to all these; the bare office, the orange  flare of the great sun, the names of the dimming mountains. But beyond a  polished glass desk, a man sat watching me. And I had never seen the man  before.    He was chubby, and not young, and had ginger-colored eyebrows and a  fringe of ginger-colored hair around the edges of a forehead which was  otherwise quite pink and bald. He was wearing a white uniform coat, and  the intertwined caduceus on the pocket and on the sleeve proclaimed him  a member of the Medical Service attached to the Civilian HQ of the  Terran Trade City.    I didn't stop to make all these evaluations consciously, of course. They  were just part of my world when I woke up and found it taking shape  around me. The familiar mountains, the familiar sun, the strange man.  But he spoke to me in a friendly way, as if it were an ordinary thing to  find a perfect stranger sprawled out taking a siesta in here.    \"Could I trouble you to tell me your name?\"    That was reasonable enough. If I found somebody making himself at home  in my office--if I had an office--I'd ask him his name, too. I started  to swing my legs to the floor, and had to stop and steady myself with  one hand while the room drifted in giddy circles around me.    [Illustration: The man in the mirror was a stranger.]    \"I wouldn't try to sit up just yet,\" he remarked, while the floor calmed  down again. Then he repeated, politely but insistently, \"Your name?\"    \"Oh, yes. My name.\" It was--I fumbled through layers of what felt like  gray fuzz, trying to lay my tongue on the most familiar of all sounds,  my own name. It was--why, it was--I said, on a high rising note, \"This  is damn silly,\" and swallowed. And swallowed again. Hard.    \"Calm down,\" the chubby man said soothingly. That was easier said than  done. I stared at him in growing panic and demanded, \"But, but, have I  had amnesia or something?\"    \"Or something.\"    \"What's my _name_?\"    \"Now, now, take it easy! I'm sure you'll remember it soon enough. You  can answer other questions, I'm sure. How old are you?\"    I answered eagerly and quickly, \"Twenty-two.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The chubby man scribbled something on a card. \"Interesting.  In-ter-est-ing. Do you know where we are?\"    I looked around the office. \"In the Terran Headquarters. From your  uniform, I'd say we were on Floor 8--Medical.\"    He nodded and scribbled again, pursing his lips. \"Can you--uh--tell me  what planet we are on?\"    I had to laugh. \"Darkover,\" I chuckled, \"I hope! And if you want the  names of the moons, or the date of the founding of the Trade City, or  something--\"    He gave in, laughing with me. \"Remember where you were born?\"    \"On Samarra. I came here when I was three years old--my father was in  Mapping and Exploring--\" I stopped short, in shock. \"He's dead!\"    \"Can you tell me your father's name?\"    \"Same as mine. Jay--Jason--\" the flash of memory closed down in the  middle of a word. It had been a good try, but it hadn't quite worked.  The doctor said soothingly, \"We're doing very well.\"    \"You haven't told me anything,\" I accused. \"Who are you? Why are you  asking me all these questions?\"    He pointed to a sign on his desk. I scowled and spelled out the letters.  \"Randall ... Forth ... Director ... Department ...\" and Dr. Forth made a  note. I said aloud, \"It is--_Doctor_ Forth, isn't it?\"    \"Don't you know?\"    I looked down at myself, and shook my head. \"Maybe _I'm_ Doctor Forth,\"  I said, noticing for the first time that I was also wearing a white coat  with the caduceus emblem of Medical. But it had the wrong feel, as if I  were dressed in somebody else's clothes. _I_ was no doctor, was I? I  pushed back one sleeve slightly, exposing a long, triangular scar under  the cuff. Dr. Forth--by now I was sure _he_ was Dr. Forth--followed the  direction of my eyes.    \"Where did you get the scar?\"    \"Knife fight. One of the bands of those-who-may-not-enter-cities caught  us on the slopes, and we--\" the memory thinned out again, and I said  despairingly, \"It's all confused! What's the matter? Why am I up on  Medical? Have I had an accident? Amnesia?\"    \"Not exactly. I'll explain.\"    I got up and walked to the window, unsteadily because my feet wanted to  walk slowly while I felt like bursting through some invisible net and  striding there at one bound. Once I got to the window the room stayed  put while I gulped down great breaths of warm sweetish air. I said, \"I  could use a drink.\"    \"Good idea. Though I don't usually recommend it.\" Forth reached into a  drawer for a flat bottle; poured tea-colored liquid into a throwaway  cup. After a minute he poured more for himself. \"Here. And sit down,  man. You make me nervous, hovering like that.\"    I didn't sit down. I strode to the door and flung it open. Forth's voice  was low and unhurried.    \"What's the matter? You can go out, if you want to, but won't you sit  down and talk to me for a minute? Anyway, where do you want to go?\"    The question made me uncomfortable. I took a couple of long breaths and  came back into the room. Forth said, \"Drink this,\" and I poured it down.  He refilled the cup unasked, and I swallowed that too and felt the hard  lump in my middle begin to loosen up and dissolve.           *       *       *       *       *    Forth said, \"Claustrophobia too. Typical,\" and scribbled on the card  some more. I was getting tired of that performance. I turned on him to  tell him so, then suddenly felt amused--or maybe it was the liquor  working in me. He seemed such a funny little man, shutting himself up  inside an office like this and talking about claustrophobia and watching  me as if I were a big bug. I tossed the cup into a disposal.    \"Isn't it about time for a few of those explanations?\"    \"If you think you can take it. How do you feel now?\"    \"Fine.\" I sat down on the couch again, leaning back and stretching out  my long legs comfortably. \"What did you put in that drink?\"    He chuckled. \"Trade secret. Now; the easiest way to explain would be to  let you watch a film we made yesterday.\"    \"To watch--\" I stopped. \"It's your time we're wasting.\"    He punched a button on the desk, spoke into a mouthpiece. \"Surveillance?  Give us a monitor on--\" he spoke a string of incomprehensible numbers,  while I lounged at ease on the couch. Forth waited for an answer, then  touched another button and steel louvers closed noiselessly over the  windows, blacking them out. I rose in sudden panic, then relaxed as the  room went dark. The darkness felt oddly more normal than the light, and  I leaned back and watched the flickers clear as one wall of the office  became a large visionscreen. Forth came and sat beside me on the leather  couch, but in the picture Forth was there, sitting at his desk, watching  another man, a stranger, walk into the office.    Like Forth, the newcomer wore a white coat with the caduceus emblems. I  disliked the man on sight. He was tall and lean and composed, with a  dour face set in thin lines. I guessed that he was somewhere in his  thirties. Dr.-Forth-in-the-film said, \"Sit down, Doctor,\" and I drew a  long breath, overwhelmed by a curious, certain sensation.    _I have been here before. I have seen this happen before._    (And curiously formless I felt. I sat and watched, and I knew I was  watching, and sitting. But it was in that dreamlike fashion, where the  dreamer at once watches his visions and participates in them....)           *       *       *       *       *    \"Sit down, Doctor,\" Forth said, \"did you bring in the reports?\"    Jay Allison carefully took the indicated seat, poised nervously on the  edge of the chair. He sat very straight, leaning forward only a little  to hand a thick folder of papers across the desk. Forth took it, but  didn't open it. \"What do you think, Dr. Allison?\"    \"There is no possible room for doubt.\" Jay Allison spoke precisely, in a  rather high-pitched and emphatic tone. \"It follows the statistical  pattern for all recorded attacks of 48-year fever ... by the way, sir,  haven't we any better name than that for this particular disease? The  term '48-year fever' connotes a fever of 48 years duration, rather than  a pandemic recurring every 48 years.\"    \"A fever that lasted 48 years would be quite a fever,\" Dr. Forth said  with the shadow of a grim smile. \"Nevertheless that's the only name we  have so far. Name it and you can have it. Allison's disease?\"    Jay Allison greeted this pleasantry with a repressive frown. \"As I  understand it, the disease cycle seems to be connected somehow with the  once-every-48-years conjunction of the four moons, which explains why  the Darkovans are so superstitious about it. The moons have remarkably  eccentric orbits--I don't know anything about that part, I'm quoting Dr.  Moore. If there's an animal vector to the disease, we've never  discovered it.
