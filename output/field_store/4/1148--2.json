Farewell to Nemi          Preface    THE PRIMARY aim of this book is to explain the remarkable rule which  regulated the succession to the priesthood of Diana at Aricia. When  I first set myself to solve the problem more than thirty years ago,  I thought that the solution could be propounded very briefly, but I  soon found that to render it probable or even intelligible it was  necessary to discuss certain more general questions, some of which  had hardly been broached before. In successive editions the  discussion of these and kindred topics has occupied more and more  space, the enquiry has branched out in more and more directions,  until the two volumes of the original work have expanded into  twelve.

Its purpose is also to see the historical context in  which our legal doctrines developed. It includes the inception of the  common law system, which was praised because it made law which was not  handed down by an absolutist king; the origin of the jury system; the  meaning of the Magna Carta provisions in their historical context; and  the emergence of attorneys.         This book is a primer. One may read it without prior knowledge of  history or law, although it will be more meaningful to attorneys than to  others. It can serve as an introduction on which to base further reading  in English legal history. It defines terms unique to English legal  history. However, the meaning of some terms in King Aethelbert's code in  Chapter 1 are unknown or inexact.         In the Table of Contents, the title of each chapter denotes an  important legal development in the given time period for that chapter.  Each chapter is divided into three sections: The Times, The Law, and  Judicial Procedure.         The Times section sets a background and context in which to better  understand the law of that period. The usual subject matter of history  such as battles, wars, royal intrigues, periods of corruption, and  international relations are omitted as not helping to understand the  process of civilization and development of the law. Standard practices  are described, but there are often variations with locality. Also,  change did not come abruptly, but with vacillations, e.g. the change  from pagan to Christian belief and the change to allowance of loans for  interest. The scientific revolution was accepted only slowly. There were  often many attempts made for change before it actually occurred, e.g.  gaining Parliamentary power over the king's privileges, such as  taxation.         The Law section describes the law governing the behavior and conduct of  the populace. It includes law of that time which is the same, similar,  or a building block to the law of today. In earlier times this is both  statutory law and the common law of the courts. The Magna Carta, which  is quoted in Chapter 7, is the first statute of England and is listed  first in the \"Statutes of the Realm\" and the \"Statutes at Large\". The  law sections of Chapters 7 - 18 mainly quote or paraphrase almost all of  these statutes. Excluded are statutes which do not help us understand  the development of our law, such as statutes governing Wales after its  conquest and statutes on succession rights to the throne.         The Judicial Procedure section describes the process of applying the  law and trying cases, and jurisdictions. It also contains some examples  of cases.         For easy comparison, amounts of money expressed in pounds or marks  [Danish denomination] have often been converted to the smaller  denominations of shillings and pence. There are twenty shillings in a  pound. A mark in silver is two-thirds of a pound. Shillings are  abbreviated: \"s.\" There are twelve pennies or pence in a Norman  shilling. Pence are abbreviated \"d.\" Six shillings and two pence is  denoted 6s.2d. A scaett was a coin of silver and copper of lesser  denomination than a shilling. There were no coins of the denomination of  shilling during Anglo-Saxon times.         The sources and reference books from which information was obtained are  listed in a bibliography instead of being contained in tedious  footnotes. There is no index to pages because the electronic text will  print out its pages differently on different computers with different  computer settings. Instead, a word search may be done on the electronic  text.                                      Dedication and Acknowledgements         A Vassar College faculty member once dedicated her book to her  students, but for whom it would have been written much earlier. This  book \"Our Legal Heritage\" is dedicated to the faculty of Vassar College,  without whom it would never have been written. Much appreciation goes to  Professor James Curtin of Loyola Law School for his review and comments  on this book's medieval period: Chapters 4-10, and especially his  comment that \"I learned quite a bit about life in those days from your  work.\" Thanks go to Loyola University Law School Professor George  Anastaplo for introducing me to Professor Curtin. Much appreciation goes  to Professor Lacey Baldwin Smith of Northwestern University's History  Department for his review and comments on this book's Tudor and Stuart  periods: Chapters 11-17, especially his comment that he learned a lot.  Thanks go to Northwestern University Law School Professor Steven Presser  for introducing me to Professor Smith. Finally, many thanks go to fellow  Mensan William Wedgeworth for proof-reading the entire book.                                                  Table of Contents            Chapters:              1.

At first,  people hunted and gathered their food. They wore animal skins over their  bodies for warmth and around their feet for protection when walking.  These skins were sewn together with bone needles and threads made from  animal sinews. They carried small items by hooking them onto their  belts. They used bone and stone tools, e.g. for preparing skins. Their  uncombed hair was held by thistlethorns, animal spines, or straight bone  hair pins. They wore conical hats of bound rush and lived in rush  shelters.         Early clans, headed by kings, lived in huts on top of hills or other  high places and fortified by circular or contour earth ditches and banks  behind which they could gather for protection. They were probably dug  with antler picks and wood spades. The people lived in rectangular huts  with four wood posts supporting a roof. The walls were made of saplings,  and a mixture of mud and straw. Cooking was in a clay oven inside or  over an open fire on the outside. Water was carried in animal skins or  leather pouches from springs lower on the hill up to the settlement.  Forests abounded with wolves, bears, deer, wild boars, and wild cattle.  They could more easily be seen from the hill tops. Pathways extended  through this camp of huts and for many miles beyond.         For wives, men married women of their clan or bought or captured other  women, perhaps with the help of a best man. They carried their unwilling  wives over the thresholds of their huts, which were sometimes in places  kept secret from her family. The first month of marriage was called the  honeymoon because the couple was given mead, a drink with fermented  honey and herbs, for the first month of their marriage. A wife wore a  gold wedding band on the ring finger of her left hand to show that she  was married.         Women usually stayed at home caring for children, preparing meals, and  making baskets. They also made wool felt and spun and wove wool into a  coarse cloth. Flax was grown and woven into a coarse linen cloth.  Spinning the strands into one continuous thread was done on a stick,  which the woman could carry about and spin at anytime when her hands  were free. The weaving was done on an upright or warp-weighted loom.  People of means draped the cloth around their bodies and fastened it  with a metal brooch inlayed with gold, gems, and shell, which were glued  on with glue that was obtained from melting animal hooves. People drank  from hollowed- out animal horns, which they could carry from belts. They  could tie things with rawhide strips or rope braids they made. Kings  drank from animal horns decorated with gold or from cups of amber,  shale, or pure gold. Men and women wore pendants and necklaces of  colorful stones, shells, amber beads, bones, and deer teeth. They  skinned and cut animals with hand-axes and knives made of flint dug up  from pits and formed by hitting flakes off. The speared fish with barbed  bone prongs or wrapped bait around a flint, bone, or shell fish hook. On  the"]]]
