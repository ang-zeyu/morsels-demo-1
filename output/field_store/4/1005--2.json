ASK FOR OUR CATALOGUE.          SUGAR BOILING.      This branch of the trade or business of a confectioner is perhaps the  most important. All manufacturers are more or less interested in it, and  certainly no retail shop could be considered orthodox which did not  display a tempting variety of this class. So inclusive is the term  \"boiled goods\" that it embraces drops, rocks, candies, taffies, creams,  caramels, and a number of different sorts of hand-made, machine-made,  and moulded goods. It is the most ancient method of which we have any  knowledge, and perhaps the most popular process of modern times; the  evidence of our everyday experience convinces us that (notwithstanding  the boom which heralds from time to time a new sweet, cooked in a  different manner, composed of ingredients hitherto unused in business),  it is the exception when such goods hold the front rank for more than a  few months, however pretty, tasty, or tempting they may be, the public  palate seems to fall back on those made in the old lines which, though  capable of improvement, seem not to be superceded. Of the entire make of  confectionery in Canada, at least two-thirds of it may be written down  under the name of boiled sugar. They are undoubtedly the chief features  with both manufacturers and retailers, embracing, as they do, endless  facilities for fertile brains and deft fingers for inventing novelties  in design, manipulation, combination, and finish. Notwithstanding the  already great variety, there is always daily something new in this  department brought into market. Many of the most successful houses owe  their popularity more to their heads than their hands, hence the  importance of studying this branch in all its ramifications. The endless  assortment requiring different methods for preparing and manipulating  make it necessary to sub-divide this branch into sections, order and  arrangement being so necessary to be thoroughly understood. _When we  consider the few inexpensive tools required to make so many kinds of  saleable goods, it is not to be wondered at so many retailers have a  fancy to make their own toffees and such like, there is no reason why a  man or woman, with ordinary patience, a willing and energetic  disposition, favored with a fair amount of intelligence, should not be  able to become with the aid of THIS BOOK and a few dollars for tools,  fairly good sugar boilers, with a few months practice._    There are reasons why a retail confectioner should study sugar boiling.  It gives character to the business, a fascinating odour to the premises,  and a general at-homeness to the surroundings. No goods look more  attractive and tempting to the sweet eating public than fresh made goods  of this kind. A bright window can be only so kept by makers. Grainy or  sticky drops may be reboiled; scraps and what would otherwise be almost  waste (at least unsightly) may be redressed in another shape, and  become, not only saleable, but profitable. _There are many advantages  which a maker possesses over one who buys all._ For instance, clear  boiled goods should be kept air tight, and are therefore delivered to  the retailers in bottles, jars, or tins, on which charge is made, these  have to be repacked and returned. Breakages are an important item, so is  freight--the cost of the latter is saved and the former reduced to a  minimum.    Whatever means are adopted to benefit the retailer and advertise the  business by brighter windows, cleaner shops, less faded goods, and  healthier financial conditions must contribute to the general prosperity  of the trade, from the bottom step to the top rung of the ladder.    It should be the aim of all amateurs to study quality rather than price.  Goods well made, carefully flavored, and nicely displayed will always  command a ready sale at a fair price, giving satisfaction to the  consumer and credit to the maker. Give your customers something to  please the eye as well as the palate, so that every sale may be looked  upon as an advertisement. Cheap, bulky, insipid stuff is unprofitable  and damaging to the trade as well as to the seller. I venture to assert  that more would-be makers have come to grief trying to cut each other in  price for rubbishy candies than through any other cause. Look at the  number of firms who have a reputation, whose very name command trade  at good prices, year after year add to the turnover. What is the  talisman? Look at their goods. There is perhaps nothing very striking in  them, but they are _invariably good_, busy or slack they are made with  care, packed with taste, and delivered neatly in a business-like  fashion. Compare this to our makers of cheap stuff; to obtain orders  they sell at unprofitable prices, often at a loss, and try to make up  the difference by resorting to various methods of increasing the bulk,  the result is ultimate ruin to themselves, loss to their creditors, and  injury to every one concerned. Few who read these lines will not be able  to verify all that is stated. The writer's advice has always been to  keep up a _high degree of excellence, try to improve in every direction,  and success is only a matter of patience, energy and civility_.    It is not intended to give a complete list of all kinds of candy known  in the trade, that would be absurd and impossible. To be able to make  any particular kind will require knowledge only to be gained by  experience, so that much depends on the thoughtful endeavor of the  beginner.      THE WORKSHOP.    Sugar boiling, like every other craft, requires a place to do it, fitted  with tools and appliances. The requisites and requirements can be easily  suited to the purse of the would-be confectioner. A work to be useful to  all must cater for all, and include information which will be useful to  the smaller storekeeper as well as the larger maker. To begin at the  bottom, one can easily imagine a person whose only ambition is to make a  little candy for the window fit for children. This could be done with a  very small outlay for utensils. The next move is the purchase of a sugar  boiler's furnace not very costly and certainly indispensable where  quality and variety are required, it will be a great saving of time as  well as money, the sugar will boil a much better color, so that cheaper  sugar may be used for brown or yellow goods, while one can make acid  drops and other white goods from granulated. Dutch crush, or loaf sugar,  which would be impossible to make on a kitchen stove from any sort of  sugar.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.    Steel Candy Furnace.    No. 1--24 in. high, 19 in. diameter.

Although I have left the strict line of  historical truth in many places, the animals in this book were all real  characters. They lived the lives I have depicted, and showed the stamp  of heroism and personality more strongly by far than it has been in the  power of my pen to tell.    I believe that natural history has lost much by the vague general  treatment that is so common. What satisfaction would be derived from  a ten-page sketch of the habits and customs of Man? How much more  profitable it would be to devote that space to the life of some one  great man. This is the principle I have endeavored to apply to my  animals. The real personality of the individual, and his view of life  are my theme, rather than the ways of the race in general, as viewed by  a casual and hostile human eye.    This may sound inconsistent in view of my having pieced together some of  the characters, but that was made necessary by the fragmentary nature  of the records. There is, however, almost no deviation from the truth in  Lobo, Bingo, and the Mustang.    Lobo lived his wild romantic life from 1889 to 1894 in the Currumpaw  region, as the ranchmen know too well, and died, precisely as related,  on January 31, 1894.    Bingo was my dog from 1882 to 1888, in spite of interruptions, caused by  lengthy visits to New York, as my Manitoban friends will remember. And  my old friend, the owner of Tan, will learn from these pages how his dog  really died.    The Mustang lived not far from Lobo in the early nineties. The story is  given strictly as it occurred, excepting that there is a dispute as to  the manner of his death. According to some testimony he broke his neck  in the corral that he was first taken to. Old Turkeytrack is where he  cannot be consulted to settle it.    Wully is, in a sense, a compound of two dogs; both were mongrels, of  some collie blood, and were raised as sheep-dogs. The first part of  Wully is given as it happened, after that it was known only that he  became a savage, treacherous sheep-killer. The details of the second  part belong really to another, a similar yaller dog, who long lived  the double-life---a faithful sheep-dog by day, and a bloodthirsty,  treacherous monster by night. Such things are less rare than is  supposed, and since writing these stories I have heard of another  double-lived sheep-dog that added to its night amusements the crowning  barbarity of murdering the smaller dogs of the neighborhood. He had  killed twenty, and hidden them in a sandpit, when discovered by his  master. He died just as Wully did.    All told, I now have information of six of these Jekyll-Hyde dogs. In  each case it happened to be a collie.    Redruff really lived in the Don Valley north of Toronto, and many of my  companions will remember him. He was killed in 1889, between the Sugar  Loaf and Castle Frank, by a creature whose name I have withheld, as it  is the species, rather than the individual, that I wish to expose.    Silverspot, Raggylug, and Vixen are founded on real characters. Though  I have ascribed to them the adventures of more than one of their kind,  every incident in their biographies is from life.    The fact that these stories are true is the reason why all are tragic.  The life of a wild animal always has a tragic end.    Such a collection of histories naturally suggests a common thought--a  moral it would have been called in the last century. No doubt each  different mind will find a moral to its taste, but I hope some will  herein find emphasized a moral as old as Scripture--we and the beasts  are kin. Man has nothing that the animals have not at least a vestige  of, the animals have nothing that man does not in some degree share.    Since, then, the animals are creatures with wants and feelings differing  in degree only from our own, they surely have their rights. This  fact, now beginning to be recognized by the Caucasian world, was first  proclaimed by Moses and was emphasized by the Buddhist over 2,000 years  ago.    ERNEST THOMPSON SETON          LOBO, The King of Currumpaw      I    CURRUMPAW is a vast cattle range in northern New Mexico. It is a land of  rich pastures and teeming flocks and herds, a land of rolling mesas and  precious running waters that at length unite in the Currumpaw River,  from which the whole region is named. And the king whose despotic power  was felt over its entire extent was an old gray wolf.    Old Lobo, or the king, as the Mexicans called him, was the gigantic  leader of a remarkable pack of gray wolves, that had ravaged the  Currumpaw Valley for a number of years. All the shepherds and ranchmen  knew him well, and, wherever he appeared with his trusty band, terror  reigned supreme among the cattle, and wrath and despair among their  owners. Old Lobo was a giant among wolves, and was cunning and strong  in proportion to his size. His voice at night was well-known and easily  distinguished from that of any of his fellows. An ordinary wolf might  howl half the night about the herdsman's bivouac without attracting  more than a passing notice, but when the deep roar of the old king came  booming down the canon, the watcher bestirred himself and prepared to  learn in the morning that fresh and serious inroads had been made among  the herds.    Old Lobo's band was but a small one. This I never quite understood, for  usually, when a wolf rises to the position and power that he had, he  attracts a numerous following. It may be that he had as many as he  desired, or perhaps his ferocious temper prevented the increase of his  pack. Certain is it that Lobo had only five followers during the latter  part of his reign. Each of these, however, was a wolf of renown, most  of them were above the ordinary size, one in particular, the second in  command, was a veritable giant, but even he was far below the leader  in size and prowess. Several of the band, besides the two leaders, were  especially noted. One of those was a beautiful white wolf, that the  Mexicans called Blanca; this was supposed to be a female, possibly  Lobo's mate. Another was a yellow wolf of remarkable swiftness, which,  according to current stories had, on several occasions, captured an  antelope for the pack.    It will be seen, then, that these wolves were thoroughly well-known to  the cowboys and shepherds. They were frequently seen and oftener heard,  and their lives were intimately associated with those of the cattlemen,  who would so gladly have destroyed them. There was not a stockman on the  Currumpaw who would not readily have given the value of many steers for  the scalp of any one of Lobo's band, but they seemed to possess charmed  lives, and defied all manner of devices to kill them. They scorned all  hunters, derided all poisons, and continued, for at least five years,  to exact their tribute from the Currumpaw ranchers to the extent, many  said, of a cow each day. According to this estimate, therefore, the band  had killed more than two thousand of the finest stock, for, as was only  too well-known, they selected the best in every instance.    The old idea that a wolf was constantly in a starving state, and  therefore ready to eat anything, was as far as possible from the  truth in this case, for these freebooters were always sleek and  well-conditioned, and were in fact most fastidious about what they ate.  Any animal that had died from natural causes, or that was diseased or  tainted, they would not touch, and they even rejected anything that  had been killed by the stockmen. Their choice and daily food was the  tenderer part of a freshly killed yearling heifer. An old bull or cow  they disdained, and though they occasionally took a young calf or colt,  it was quite clear that veal or horseflesh was not their favorite diet.  It was also known that they were not fond of mutton, although they often  amused themselves by killing sheep. One night in November, 1893, Blanca  and the yellow wolf killed two hundred and fifty sheep, apparently for  the fun of it, and did not eat an ounce of their flesh.    These are examples of many stories which I might repeat, to show the  ravages of this destructive band. Many new devices for their extinction  were tried each year, but still they lived and throve in spite of all  the efforts of their foes. A great price was set on Lobo's head, and in  consequence poison in a score of subtle forms was put out for him, but  he never failed to detect and avoid it. One thing only he feared--that  was firearms, and knowing full well that all men in this region carried  them, he never was known to attack or face a human being. Indeed, the  set policy of his band was to take refuge in flight whenever, in the  daytime, a man was descried, no matter at what distance. Lobo's habit of  permitting the pack to eat only that which they themselves had killed,  was in numerous cases their salvation, and the keenness of his scent to  detect the taint of human hands or the poison itself, completed their  immunity.    On one occasion, one of the cowboys heard the too familiar rallying-cry  of Old Lobo, and, stealthily approaching, he found the Currumpaw pack in  a hollow, where they had 'rounded' up a small herd of cattle. Lobo sat  apart on a knoll, while Blanca with the rest was endeavoring to 'cut  out' a young cow, which they had selected; but the cattle were standing  in a compact mass with their heads outward, and presented"]]]
