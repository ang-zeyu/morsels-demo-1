Our knowledge of the life, manners, and customary laws of many  Australian tribes has, in recent years, been vastly increased by the  admirable works of Mr. Howitt, and of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen. But  Mrs. Parker treats of a tribe which, hitherto, has hardly been  mentioned by anthropologists, and she has had unexampled opportunities  of study. It is hardly possible for a scientific male observer to be  intimately familiar with the women and children of a savage tribe. Mrs.  Parker, on the other hand, has had, as regards the women and children  of the Euahlayi, all the advantages of the squire's wife in a rural  neighbourhood, supposing the squire's wife to be an intelligent and  sympathetic lady, with a strong taste for the study of folklore and  rustic custom. Among the Zulus, we know, it is the elder women who tell  the popular tales, so carefully translated and edited by Bishop  Colenso. Mrs. Parker has already published two volumes of Euahlayi  tales, though I do not know that I have ever seen them cited, except by  myself, in anthropological discussion. As they contain many beautiful  and romantic touches, and references to the Euahlayi 'All Father,' or  paternal 'super man,' Byamee, they may possibly have been regarded as  dubious materials, dressed up for the European market. Mrs. Parker's  new volume, I hope, will prove that she is a close scientific observer,  who must be reckoned with by students. She has not scurried through the  region occupied by her tribe, but has had them constantly under her  eyes for a number of years.    My own slight share in the book as it stands ought to be mentioned.  After reading the original MS., I catechised Mrs. Parker as to her  amount of knowledge of the native language; her methods of obtaining  information; and the chances that missionary influence had affected the  Euahlayi legends and beliefs. I wrote out her answers, and she read and  revised what I had written. I also collected many scattered notices of  Byamee into the chapter on that being, which Mrs. Parker has read and  approved. I introduced a reference to Mr. Howitt's theory of the 'All  Father,' and I added some references to other authorities on the  Australian tribes. Except for this, and for a very few purely verbal  changes in matter of style, Mrs. Parker's original manuscript is  untouched by me. It seems necessary to mention these details, as I  have, in other works, expressed my own opinions on Australian religion  and customary law. [MAKING OF RELIGION, second edition; MYTH, RITUAL, AND  RELIGION, second edition.] These opinions I have not, so to speak, edited  into the work of Mrs. Parker. The author herself has remarked that,  beginning as a disciple of Mr. Herbert Spencer in regard to the  religious ideas of the Australians--according to that writer, mere  dread of casual 'spirits'--she was obliged to alter her attitude, in  consequence of all that she learned at first hand. She also explains  that her tribe are not 'wild blacks,' though, in the absence of  missionary influences, they retain their ancient beliefs, at least the  old people do; and, in a decadent form, preserve their tribal  initiations, or Boorah. How she tested and controlled the evidence of  her informants she has herself stated, and I venture to think that she  could hardly have made a better use of her opportunities.    In one point there is perhaps, almost unavoidably, a lacuna or gap in  her information. The Euahlayi, she says, certainly do not possess the  Dieri and Urabunna custom of Pirrauru or Piraungaru, by which married,  and unmarried men, of the classes men and women which may intermarry,  are solemnly allotted to each other as more or less permanent paramours.  [See Mr. Howitt's NATIVE TRIBES OF SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIA, and my  SECRET OF THE TOTEM, chapter iii.] That custom, for some unknown reason,  is confined to certain tribes possessing the two social divisions with the  untranslated names MATTERI and KIRARU. These tribes range from Lake Eyre  southward, perhaps, as far as the sea. Their peculiar custom is unknown to  the Euahlayi, but Mrs. Parker does not inform us concerning any recognised  licence which may, as is usual, accompany their Boorah assemblies, or  their 'harvest home' of gathered grass seed, which she describes.    Any reader of Mrs. Parker's book who has not followed recent  anthropological discussions, may need to be apprised of the nature of  these controversies, and of the probable light thrown on them by the  full description of the Euahlayi tribe. The two chief points in dispute  are (1) the nature and origin of the marriage laws of the Australians;  and (2) the nature and origin of such among their ideas and practices  as may be styled 'religious.' As far as what we commonly call material  civilisation is concerned, the natives of the Australian continent are  probably the most backward of mankind, having no agriculture, no  domestic animals, and no knowledge of metal-working. Their weapons and  implements are of wood, stone, and bone, and they have not even the  rudest kind of pottery. But though the natives are all, in their  natural state, on or about this common low level, their customary laws,  ceremonials, and beliefs are rich in variety.    As regards marriage rules they are in several apparently ascending  grades of progress. First we have tribes in which each person is born  into one or other of two social divisions usually called 'phratries.'  Say that the names of the phratries mean Eagle Hawk and Crow. Each  born Crow must marry an Eagle Hawk; each born Eagle Hawk must marry a  Crow. The names are derived through the mothers. One obvious result is  that no two persons, brother and sister maternal, can intermarry; but  the rule also excludes from intermarriage great numbers of persons in  no way akin to each other by blood, who merely share the common phratry  name, Crow or Eagle Hawk.    In each phratry are smaller sets of persons, each set distinguished by  the name of some animal or other natural object, their 'totem.' The  same totem is never found in both phratries. Thus a person marrying out  of his or her phratry, as all must do, necessarily marries out of his  or her totem.    The same arrangements exist among tribes which derive phratry and totem  names through the father.    This derivation of names and descent through the father is regarded by  almost all students, and by Mr. J. G. Frazer, in one passage of his  latest study of the subject, as a great step in progress. ['The Beginnings  of Religion and Totemism among the Australian Aborigines,' FORTNIGHTLY  REVIEW, September 1905, p. 452.] The obvious result of paternal descent is  to make totem communities or kins local. In any district most of the  people will be of the same paternal totem name--say, Grub, Iguana, Emu,  or what not. Just so, in Glencoe of old, most of the people were MacIans;  in Appin most were Stewarts; in South Argyll Campbells, and so on.    The totem kins are thus, with paternal descent, united both by supposed  blood ties in the totem kin, and by associations of locality. This is  certainly a step in social progress.    But while Mr. Frazer, with almost all inquirers, acknowledges this, ten  pages later in his essay he no longer considers the descent of the  totem in the paternal line as necessarily 'a step in progress' from  descent in the maternal line. 'The common assumption that inheritance  of the totem through the mother always preceded inheritance of it through  the father need not hold good,'[IBID. p. 462.] he remarks.    Thus it appears that a tribe has not necessarily made 'a great step in  progress,' because it reckons descent of the totem on the male side. If  this be so, we cannot so easily decide as to which tribe is socially  advanced and which is not.    In any case, however, there is a test of social advance. There is an  acknowledged advance when a tribe is divided into, not two, but four or  eight divisions, which may not intermarry. [IBID. p. 454] The Euahlayi have  four such divisions. In each of their intermarrying phratries are two  'Matrimonial Classes,' each with its name, and these are so constituted  that a member of the elder generation can never marry a member of the  succeeding generation. This rule prevents, of course, marriage between  parent and child, but such marriages never do occur in the pristine  tribes of the Darling river which have no such classes. The four-class  arrangement excludes from intermarriage all persons, whether parents  and children or not, who bear the same class name, say Hippai.

The ancient and famous metropolis of the North sits overlooking a windy  estuary from the slope and summit of three hills.  No situation could be  more commanding for the head city of a kingdom; none better chosen for  noble prospects.  From her tall precipice and terraced gardens she looks  far and wide on the sea and broad champaigns.  To the east you may catch  at sunset the spark of the May lighthouse, where the Firth expands into  the German Ocean; and away to the west, over all the carse of Stirling,  you can see the first snows upon Ben Ledi.    But Edinburgh pays cruelly for her high seat in one of the vilest  climates under heaven.  She is liable to be beaten upon by all the winds  that blow, to be drenched with rain, to be buried in cold sea fogs out of  the east, and powdered with the snow as it comes flying southward from  the Highland hills.  The weather is raw and boisterous in winter, shifty  and ungenial in summer, and a downright meteorological purgatory in the  spring.  The delicate die early, and I, as a survivor, among bleak winds  and plumping rain, have been sometimes tempted to envy them their fate.  For all who love shelter and the blessings of the sun, who hate dark  weather and perpetual tilting against squalls, there could scarcely be  found a more unhomely and harassing place of residence.  Many such aspire  angrily after that Somewhere-else of the imagination, where all troubles  are supposed to end.  They lean over the great bridge which joins the New  Town with the Old--that windiest spot, or high altar, in this northern  temple of the winds--and watch the trains smoking out from under them and  vanishing into the tunnel on a voyage to brighter skies.  Happy the  passengers who shake off the dust of Edinburgh, and have heard for the  last time the cry of the east wind among her chimney-tops!  And yet the  place establishes an interest in people's hearts; go where they will,  they find no city of the same distinction; go where they will, they take  a pride in their old home.    [Picture: Gate of Holyrood] Venice, it has been said, differs from  another cities in the sentiment which she inspires.  The rest may have  admirers; she only, a famous fair one, counts lovers in her train.  And,  indeed, even by her kindest friends, Edinburgh is not considered in a  similar sense.  These like her for many reasons, not any one of which is  satisfactory in itself.  They like her whimsically, if you will, and  somewhat as a virtuoso dotes upon his cabinet.  Her attraction is  romantic in the narrowest meaning of the term.  Beautiful as she is, she  is not so much beautiful as interesting.  She is pre-eminently Gothic,  and all the more so since she has set herself off with some Greek airs,  and erected classic temples on her crags.  In a word, and above all, she  is a curiosity.  The Palace of Holyrood has been left aside in the growth  of Edinburgh, and stands grey and silent in a workman's quarter and among  breweries and gas works.  It is a house of many memories.  Great people  of yore, kings and queens, buffoons and grave ambassadors, played their  stately farce for centuries in Holyrood.  Wars have been plotted, dancing  has lasted deep into the night,--murder has been done in its chambers.  There Prince Charlie held his phantom levees, and in a very gallant  manner represented a fallen dynasty for some hours.  Now, all these  things of clay are mingled with the dust, the king's crown itself is  shown for sixpence to the vulgar; but the stone palace has outlived these  charges.  For fifty weeks together, it is no more than a show for  tourists and a museum of old furniture; but on the fifty-first, behold  the palace reawakened and mimicking its past.  The Lord Commissioner, a  kind of stage sovereign, sits among stage courtiers; a coach and six and  clattering escort come and go before the gate; at night, the windows are  lighted up, and its near neighbours, the workmen, may dance in their own  houses to the palace music.  And in this the palace is typical.  There is  a spark among the embers; from time to time the old volcano smokes.  Edinburgh has but partly abdicated, and still wears, in parody, her  metropolitan trappings.  Half a capital and half a country town, the  whole city leads a double existence; it has long trances of the one and  flashes of the other; like the king of the Black Isles, it is half alive  and half a monumental marble.  There are armed men and cannon in the  citadel overhead; you may see the troops marshalled on the high parade;  and at night after the early winter even-fall, and in the morning before  the laggard winter dawn, the wind carries abroad over Edinburgh the sound  of drums and bugles.  Grave judges sit bewigged in what was once the  scene of imperial deliberations.  Close by in the High Street perhaps the  trumpets may sound about the stroke of noon; and you see a troop of  citizens in tawdry masquerade; tabard above, heather-mixture trowser  below, and the men themselves trudging in the mud among unsympathetic  by-standers.  The grooms of a well-appointed circus tread the streets  with a better presence.  And yet these are the Heralds and Pursuivants of  Scotland, who are about to proclaim a new law of the United Kingdom  before two-score boys, and thieves, and hackney-coachmen.  Meanwhile  every hour the bell of the University rings out over the hum of the  streets, and every hour a double tide of students, coming and going,  fills the deep archways.  And lastly, one night in the springtime--or say  one morning rather, at the peep of day--late folk may hear voices of many  men singing a psalm in unison from a church on one side of the old High  Street; and a little after, or perhaps a little before, the sound of many  men singing a psalm in unison from another church on the opposite side of  the way.  There will be something in the words above the dew of Hermon,  and how goodly it is to see brethren dwelling together in unity.  And the  late folk will tell themselves that all this singing denotes the  conclusion of two yearly ecclesiastical parliaments--the parliaments of  Churches which are brothers in many admirable virtues, but not specially  like brothers in this particular of a tolerant and peaceful life.    Again, meditative people will find a charm in a certain consonancy  between the aspect of the city and its odd and stirring history.  Few  places, if any, offer a more barbaric display of contrasts to the eye.  In the very midst stands one of the most satisfactory crags in nature--a  Bass Rock upon dry land, rooted in a garden shaken by passing trains,  carrying a crown of battlements and turrets, and describing its war-like  shadow over the liveliest and brightest thoroughfare of the new town.  From their smoky beehives, ten stories high, the unwashed look down upon  the open squares and gardens of the wealthy; and gay people sunning  themselves along Princes Street, with its mile of commercial palaces all  beflagged upon some great occasion, see, across a gardened valley set  with statues, where the washings of the Old Town flutter in the breeze at  its high windows.  And then, upon all sides, what a clashing of  architecture!  In this one valley, where the life of the town goes most  busily forward, there may be seen, shown one above and behind another by  the accidents of the ground, buildings in almost every style upon the  globe.  Egyptian and Greek temples, Venetian palaces and Gothic spires,  are huddled one over another in a most admired disorder; while, above  all, the brute mass of the Castle and the summit of Arthur's Seat look  down upon these imitations with a becoming dignity, as the works of  Nature may look down the monuments of Art.  But Nature is a more  indiscriminate patroness than we imagine, and in no way frightened of a  strong effect.  The birds roost as willingly among the Corinthian  capitals as in the crannies of the crag; the same atmosphere and daylight  clothe the eternal rock and yesterday's imitation portico; and as the  soft northern sunshine throws out everything into a glorified  distinctness--or easterly mists, coming up with the blue evening, fuse  all these incongruous features into one, and the lamps begin to glitter  along the street, and faint lights to burn in the high windows across the  valley--the feeling grows upon you that this also is a piece of nature in  the most intimate sense; that this profusion of eccentricities, this  dream in masonry and living rock, is not a drop-scene in a theatre, but a  city in the world of every-day reality, connected by railway and  telegraph-wire with all the capitals of Europe, and inhabited by citizens  of the familiar type, who keep ledgers, and attend church, and have sold  their immortal portion to a daily paper.  By all the canons of romance,  the place demands to be half deserted and leaning towards decay; birds we  might admit in profusion, the play of the sun and winds, and a few  gipsies encamped in the chief thoroughfare; but these citizens with their  cabs and tramways, their trains and posters, are altogether out of key.  Chartered tourists, they make free with historic localities, and rear  their young among the most picturesque sites with a grand human  indifference.
