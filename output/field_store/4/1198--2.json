Mr. Sterling A. Millard, of Clayville, N. Y., has invented a scythe  blade that contains much less weight of metal and possesses equal or  greater strength than the ordinary scythe blades. It is made in the  usual manner from what is termed by scythe makers a \"scythe rod,\" and  is wrought and shaped in such form that a proper thickness is left  to serve as the back of the blade. A longitudinal auxiliary rib or  supplementary back is formed on the blade, which stiffens the scythe  without requiring the same weight of metal as those of the usual  construction.    Mr. George C. Winslow, of Kalamazoo, Mich., has patented an  improvement in spring harrow teeth, which consists generally in  hinging the harrow tooth in the forward end of a rectangular frame  bolted to the harrow bar, and combining therewith a spring, which  at its back end is clamped to the harrow bar by the same bolts which  secure the rectangular frame, and which spring then curves upward and  forward, and then down through the slot or opening of the rectangular  frame, and is jointed at its extremity, near the bottom of the harrow  tooth, so that its tension serves to throw the harrow tooth forward,  but allows it to yield to obstruction.           *       *       *       *       *          A RARE SPECIMEN LOST.    Captain Ingalls, of the schooner Chalcedony, has let slip an  opportunity to make a small fortune and at the same time settle the  long vexed question as to the reality of the elusive and possibly  mythical sea serpent. His story, as told in the _Argus_, of Portland,  Maine, June 8, runs as follows:    \"Last Saturday, about one o'clock in the afternoon, we were slowly  sailing past Monhegan, there being very little wind, about twenty  miles southwest of the island, when we caught sight of what looked  like a large schooner floating bottom up. As the object lay almost  dead ahead, we made directly for it, but before we got very close a  Cape Ann schooner lay to and sent a boat's crew to inspect what now  plainly appeared to be a monstrous carcass of some species or other.  We finally hove to, about a ship's length off, and took a leisurely  survey of the thing. It was dead, and floated on the water, with its  belly, of a dirty brown color, up. It head was at least twenty feet  long, and about ten feet through at the thickest point. About midway  of the body, which was, I should guess, about forty feet long, were  two fins, of a clear white, each about twelve feet in length. The body  seemed to taper from the back of the head down to the size of a small  log, distinct from the whale tribe, as the end had nothing that looked  like a fluke. The shape of the creature's head was more like a tierce  than anything I can liken it to. I have seen almost all kinds of  shapes that can be found in these waters, but never saw the like of  this before.    Two years ago, off Seguin, I saw shooting through the water a thing  which, I think, resembled this creature considerably, but I didn't  get close enough to it to say for certain. The men from the Cape Ann  schooner got on this dead creature, and one of the boys cut a double  shuffle on its belly, which for all the world looked like the bottom  of a schooner covered with barnacles and seaweed by the weather. We  should have towed the thing to Portland had there been any wind,  but as there wasn't, we steered away and left it. What sort of a sea  monster this was I can't say for sure, but in my opinion it was the  original 'sea serpent,' which has been seen once in a while for years  past, and which, when alive, was too swift a swimmer for any sailing  vessel to get alongside of.\"    The report of the captain of the \"Cape Ann schooner\" will be in order  now.           *       *       *       *       *          [Illustration: MAXIM'S NEW GAS MACHINE.]    SIMPLE AND CHEAP PROCESS OF GAS MAKING.    When a current of air is passed over the surface of gasoline it  becomes carbureted or charged with its vapors to saturation. Air thus  charged is somewhat heavier than pure air, and when passed through an  Argand or bat's wing burner, it burns with a brilliant white flame.  Nothing would seem easier than to make a machine that would force  a current of air through, over, or on some material saturated with  gasoline, and this apparently simple process has led many into  attempts to make a successful gas machine. Many fortunes have been  spent by the unscientific in the chase after this, to them, _ignis  fatuus_. The stumbling block which has wrecked so many enterprises  in this line has been the cold produced by the evaporation of the  gasoline. One pound of gasoline, in passing from a liquid to a vapor,  requires about as much heat as would be required to melt two pounds of  cast iron. It is therefore obvious that where no heat is supplied,  the gasoline, air, and machine must soon become very cold when any  considerable quantity of gas is being made. The heat must come from  somewhere, and as none is supplied, it is taken from the apparatus,  air, and gasoline, making them very cold. A beautiful and simple  experiment to illustrate this refrigeration can be made as follows:  Place a gill of water in a common washbasin, then pour over it  one pint of light gasoline; shake the basin, and blow the liquids  vigorously, when very soon the basin will become intensely cold--the  water will freeze, and may be taken out in the form of a snowball.  If the water and basin are hot, and the experiment performed in a hot  room or in the sun, it is much more striking.[1]    This refrigeration operates upon the gas as follows: Air will take up  and hold in suspension any volatile liquid in proportion to the square  of its temperature, so that when the temperature of the gasoline and  air have fallen off one half, the quantity of gasoline in the air has  fallen off three quarters, and the light is destroyed. The quality of  the gas in such machines varies from a rich smoky flame to a pale  blue and blowing flame in a short time. Every change of quality in the  liquid, temperature of the apparatus, or number of burners used causes  a vexatious change in the quality of the gas. If heat is applied at  the right time and in the right quantity it is not so bad, but too  much heat, or neglecting to regulate it properly, converts the machine  into a still, the condenser of which is the pipes of the building  lighted, when danger is added to vexation. About ten years ago a  machine was illustrated in these columns that obviated all these  troubles; it was the invention of the well known mechanical engineer,  Hiram S.

It was many years ago, in a large village of Dutch Flanders,  the sweet and pleasant country that rejoices in brilliant flowers; a  country that gladly spreads out before us, as so many pretty toys, her  illuminated gables and wagons and towers; her cupboards and clocks that  gleam at the end of the passage; her little trees marshaled in line  along quays and canal-banks, waiting, one almost might think, for some  splendid procession to pass; her boats and her barges with sculptured  sterns, her flower-like doors and windows, her spotless dams and  many-coloured drawbridges; and her little varnished houses, bright as  new pottery, from which bell-shaped dames come forth, all a-glitter with  silver and gold, to milk the cows in the white-hedged fields, or spread  the linen on flowery lawns that are cut into patterns of oval and  lozenge and are most amazingly green.    To this spot an aged philosopher had retired, having become a little  weary; and here he had built his refuge. His happiness lay all in the  beauties of his garden; and best-loved, and visited most often, were the  bee-hives. There were twelve of them, twelve domes of straw; and some he  had painted a bright pink, and some a clear yellow, but most were a  tender blue, for he had noticed the fondness of the bees for this  color. These hives stood against the wall of the house, in the angle  formed by one of those pleasant and graceful Dutch kitchens whose  earthenware dresser, all bright with copper and brass, was reflected  through the open door on to the peaceful water of the canal. And the  water, carrying these familiar images beneath its curtain of poplars,  led one's eyes to a calm horizon of meadows and of mills.    Here, as in all places, the hives lent a new meaning to the flowers and  the silence, the balm of the air and the rays of the sun. One seemed to  have drawn very near to all that was happiest in nature. One was content  to sit down and rest at this radiant cross-road, along which the busy  and tuneful bearers of all country perfumes were incessantly passing  from dawn until dusk. One heard the musical voice of the garden, whose  loveliest hours seemed to rejoice and to sing of their gladness. One  came here, to the school of the bees, to be taught how nature is always  at work, always scheming and planning; and to learn too the lesson of  whole-hearted labor which is always to benefit others.      In order to follow, as simply as possible, the life of the bees through  the year, we will take a hive that awakes in the Spring and duly starts  on its labors; and then we shall meet, in their order, all the great  events of the bees. These are, first of all, the formation and departure  of the swarm; then, the foundation of the new city, the birth and flight  of the young queens, the massacre of the males, and, last of all, the  return of the sleep of winter. We will try to give the reasons for each  event, and to show the laws and habits that bring it about; and so,  when we have arrived at the end of the bees' short year, which extends  only from April to the last days of September, we shall have gazed on  all the mysteries of the palace of honey.    Before we knock at the door, and let our inquisitive glance travel  round, it need merely be said that the hive is composed of a queen, who  is the mother of all her people; of thousands of female worker-bees, who  are neuters or spinsters; and, finally, of some hundreds of males, who  never do any work, and are known as drones.      When for the first time we take the cover off a hive we cannot help some  feeling of fear, as though we were looking at something not meant for  our eyes, something alarming and frightening. We have always thought of  the bee as rather a dangerous creature. There is the distressful  recollection of its sting, which produces so peculiar a pain that one  knows not with what to compare it: a sort of dreadful dryness, as though  a flame of the desert had scorched the wounded limb; and one asks  oneself whether these daughters of the sun may not have distilled a  dazzling poison from their father's rays, in order to defend the  treasure which they have gathered during his shining hours.    There is no doubt that if some person, who neither knows nor respects  the habits of the bee, were suddenly to fling open the hive, this would  turn itself immediately into a burning-bush of heroism and fury; but the  slight amount of skill needed to deal with the matter can be readily  acquired. Let but a little smoke be deftly applied, let us be gentle and  careful in our movements, and the heavily-armed workers will permit  themselves to be robbed without the least thought of using their sting.  It is not the fact, as some people have stated, that the bees recognize  their owner, nor have they any fear of man; but, when the smoke reaches  them, when they become aware of what is happening, so quietly and  without any haste or disturbance, they imagine that this is not the  attack of an enemy against whom any defense is possible, but that it is  some natural catastrophe, to which they will do well to submit. Instead  of vainly struggling, therefore, their one thought is to safeguard their  future; and they rush at once to their reserves of honey, into which  they eagerly plunge themselves in order to possess the material for  starting a new city immediately, no matter where, should the old one be  destroyed or they compelled to abandon it.    A person who knows nothing of bees will be a little disappointed the  first time he looks into a hive. Let us say that it is an  observation-hive, made of glass, with black curtains and shutters and  only one comb, thus enabling the spectator to study both sides. These  hives can be placed in a drawing-room or a library without any  inconvenience or danger. The bees that live in the one I have in my  study in Paris are able--even in that great city--to do their own  marketing, as it were--in other words, to find the food they  require--and to prosper. You will have been told, when you are shown  this little glass box, that it is the home of a most extraordinary  activity; that it is governed by a number of wise laws, that it  enshrines deep mysteries; and all you will see is a mass of little,  reddish groups, somewhat resembling roasted coffee-berries or bunches of  raisins, all huddled up against the glass. They look more dead than  alive; their movements are slow, and seem confused and without any  purpose. We ask ourselves, can these be the dazzling creatures we had  seen, but a moment ago, flashing and sparkling as they darted among the  pearls and the gold of a thousand wide-open flowers?    Now, in the darkness, they seem to be shivering; to be numbed,  suffocated, so closely are they huddled together. They look as though  they were prisoners; or shall we say queens who have lost their throne,  who have had their one moment of glory in the midst of their radiant  garden, and are now compelled to return to the dingy misery of their  poor overcrowded home.    It is with them as it is with all the real things in life; they must be  studied, and we have to learn how to study them.    Much is happening inside this mass that seems so inactive, but it will  take you some time to grasp it and see it. The truth is that every  single creature in the little groups that appear scarcely to move is  hard at work, each one at its own particular trade. There is not one of  them that knows what it means to be idle; and those, for instance, that  seem fast asleep, as they hang in great clusters against the glass, are  entrusted with the most mysterious and fatiguing task of all; it is  their duty to create the marvelous wax. But we shall tell later, and in  its place, precisely what each of the bees is doing; for the moment we  will merely point out why it is that the different classes of workers  all cluster together so strangely. The fact is that the bee, even more  than the ant, is only happy when she is in the midst of a crowd; she can  only live in the crowd. When she leaves the hive, which is so densely  packed that she has to keep on butting with her head in order to pass,  she is out of her element, away from what she loves. She will dive for  an instant into flower-filled space, as the swimmer will dive into the  sea that is filled with pearls; but, just as the swimmer must come to  the surface and breathe the air, so must she, at regular intervals,  return and breathe the crowd--or she will die. Take her away from her  comrades, and however abundant the food may be, however gentle the  climate, she will perish in a few days, not of hunger or cold, but  merely of loneliness. She needs the crowd, she needs her own city, just  as she needs the honey on which she lives. This craving for  companionship in some way helps us to understand the nature of the laws  that govern the hive. For in these laws the individual bee, the one bee  apart"]]]
