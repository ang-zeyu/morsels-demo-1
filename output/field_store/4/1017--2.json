During the course of the war some sixteen Editions of this work have  appeared, each of which was, I hope, a little more full and accurate  than that which preceded it. I may fairly claim, however, that the  absolute mistakes made have been few in number, and that I have never  had occasion to reverse, and seldom to modify, the judgments which I  have formed. In this final edition the early text has been carefully  revised and all fresh available knowledge has been added within the  limits of a single volume narrative. Of the various episodes in the  latter half of the war it is impossible to say that the material is  available for a complete and final chronicle. By the aid, however, of  the official dispatches, of the newspapers, and of many private letters,  I have done my best to give an intelligible and accurate account of  the matter. The treatment may occasionally seem too brief but some  proportion must be observed between the battles of 1899-1900 and the  skirmishes of 1901-1902.    My private informants are so numerous that it would be hardly possible,  even if it were desirable, that I should quote their names. Of the  correspondents upon whose work I have drawn for my materials, I would  acknowledge my obligations to Messrs. Burleigh, Nevinson, Battersby,  Stuart, Amery, Atkins, Baillie, Kinneir, Churchill, James, Ralph,  Barnes, Maxwell, Pearce, Hamilton, and others. Especially I would  mention the gentleman who represented the 'Standard' in the last year  of the war, whose accounts of Vlakfontein, Von Donop's Convoy, and  Tweebosch were the only reliable ones which reached the public.    Arthur Conan Doyle, Undershaw, Hindhead: September 1902.          CHAPTER 1. THE BOER NATIONS.    Take a community of Dutchmen of the type of those who defended  themselves for fifty years against all the power of Spain at a time when  Spain was the greatest power in the world. Intermix with them a strain  of those inflexible French Huguenots who gave up home and fortune and  left their country for ever at the time of the revocation of the Edict  of Nantes. The product must obviously be one of the most rugged, virile,  unconquerable races ever seen upon earth. Take this formidable people  and train them for seven generations in constant warfare against savage  men and ferocious beasts, in circumstances under which no weakling could  survive, place them so that they acquire exceptional skill with weapons  and in horsemanship, give them a country which is eminently suited to  the tactics of the huntsman, the marksman, and the rider. Then, finally,  put a finer temper upon their military qualities by a dour fatalistic  Old Testament religion and an ardent and consuming patriotism. Combine  all these qualities and all these impulses in one individual, and you  have the modern Boer--the most formidable antagonist who ever crossed  the path of Imperial Britain. Our military history has largely consisted  in our conflicts with France, but Napoleon and all his veterans have  never treated us so roughly as these hard-bitten farmers with their  ancient theology and their inconveniently modern rifles.    Look at the map of South Africa, and there, in the very centre of the  British possessions, like the stone in a peach, lies the great stretch  of the two republics, a mighty domain for so small a people. How came  they there? Who are these Teutonic folk who have burrowed so deeply into  Africa? It is a twice-told tale, and yet it must be told once again if  this story is to have even the most superficial of introductions. No one  can know or appreciate the Boer who does not know his past, for he is  what his past has made him.    It was about the time when Oliver Cromwell was at his zenith--in 1652,  to be pedantically accurate--that the Dutch made their first lodgment at  the Cape of Good Hope. The Portuguese had been there before them, but,  repelled by the evil weather, and lured forwards by rumours of gold,  they had passed the true seat of empire and had voyaged further to  settle along the eastern coast. Some gold there was, but not much, and  the Portuguese settlements have never been sources of wealth to the  mother country, and never will be until the day when Great Britain  signs her huge cheque for Delagoa Bay. The coast upon which they settled  reeked with malaria. A hundred miles of poisonous marsh separated it  from the healthy inland plateau. For centuries these pioneers of South  African colonisation strove to obtain some further footing, but save  along the courses of the rivers they made little progress. Fierce  natives and an enervating climate barred their way.    But it was different with the Dutch. That very rudeness of climate  which had so impressed the Portuguese adventurer was the source of their  success. Cold and poverty and storm are the nurses of the qualities  which make for empire. It is the men from the bleak and barren lands who  master the children of the light and the heat. And so the Dutchmen at  the Cape prospered and grew stronger in that robust climate. They did  not penetrate far inland, for they were few in number and all they  wanted was to be found close at hand. But they built themselves houses,  and they supplied the Dutch East India Company with food and water,  gradually budding off little townlets, Wynberg, Stellenbosch, and  pushing their settlements up the long slopes which lead to that great  central plateau which extends for fifteen hundred miles from the edge  of the Karoo to the Valley of the Zambesi. Then came the additional  Huguenot emigrants--the best blood of France three hundred of them, a  handful of the choicest seed thrown in to give a touch of grace and soul  to the solid Teutonic strain. Again and again in the course of history,  with the Normans, the Huguenots, the Emigres, one can see the great hand  dipping into that storehouse and sprinkling the nations with the same  splendid seed. France has not founded other countries, like her great  rival, but she has made every other country the richer by the mixture  with her choicest and best. The Rouxs, Du Toits, Jouberts, Du Plessis,  Villiers, and a score of other French names are among the most familiar  in South Africa.    For a hundred more years the history of the colony was a record of the  gradual spreading of the Afrikaners over the huge expanse of veld which  lay to the north of them. Cattle raising became an industry, but in  a country where six acres can hardly support a sheep, large farms are  necessary for even small herds. Six thousand acres was the usual size,  and five pounds a year the rent payable to Government. The diseases  which follow the white man had in Africa, as in America and Australia,  been fatal to the natives, and an epidemic of smallpox cleared the  country for the newcomers. Further and further north they pushed,  founding little towns here and there, such as Graaf-Reinet and  Swellendam, where a Dutch Reformed Church and a store for the sale  of the bare necessaries of life formed a nucleus for a few scattered  dwellings. Already the settlers were showing that independence of  control and that detachment from Europe which has been their most  prominent characteristic. Even the sway of the Dutch Company (an older  but weaker brother of John Company in India) had caused them to revolt.  The local rising, however, was hardly noticed in the universal cataclysm  which followed the French Revolution. After twenty years, during which  the world was shaken by the Titanic struggle between England and France  in the final counting up of the game and paying of the stakes, the Cape  Colony was added in 1814 to the British Empire.    In all our vast collection of States there is probably not one the  title-deeds to which are more incontestable than to this one. We had it  by two rights, the right of conquest and the right of purchase. In 1806  our troops landed, defeated the local forces, and took possession of  Cape Town. In 1814 we paid the large sum of six million pounds to the  Stadholder for the transference of this and some South American land.  It was a bargain which was probably made rapidly and carelessly in that  general redistribution which was going on.

[Illustration: _Sir Basil showed his teeth in his ugly smile. \"A creator  is never merciful.\"_]      The two _bataloes_ turned from the open waters of the lower Tapajos  River into the _igarape_, the lily-smothered shallows that often mark an  Indian settlement in the jungles of Brazil. One of the two half-breed  rubber-gatherers suddenly stopped his _bataloe_ by thrusting a paddle  against a giant clump of lilies. In a corruption of the Tupi dialect, he  called over to the white man occupying the other frail craft.    \"We dare go no farther, master. The country of the Ungapuks is  bewitched. It is too dangerous.\"    Fearfully he stared over his shoulder toward a spot in the slimy water  where a dim bulk moved, which was only an alligator hunting for his  breakfast.    Hale Oakham, as long and lanky and level-eyed as Charles Lindbergh, ran  despairing fingers through his damp hair and groaned.    \"But how can I find this jungle village without a guide?\"    The _caboclo_ shrugged. \"The village will find you. It is bewitched,  master. But you will soon see the path through the _matto_.\"    \"Can't you stay by me until time to land? I don't like the looks of  these alligators.\"    \"It is better for a white man to face an alligator than for a _caboclo_  to face an Ungapuk. Once they used to kill and eat us for our strength.  Now--\" Again his shrug was eloquent.    \"Now?\" Hale prompted impatiently.    \"The white god who put a spell on these one-time cannibals will bewitch  us and make us wash and rejoice when it is time to die.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He shuddered and spat at a cayman that was lumbering away from his  _bataloe._    Hale Oakham laughed, a hearty boyish laugh for a rather learned young  professor.    \"Is that all they do to you?\" he asked.    \"No. All who enter this magic _matto_ die soon, rejoicing. Before the  last breath comes, it is said their bodies turn into a handful of silver  dust--poof!--like that.\" He snapped his dirty fingers. \"Then the life  that leaves them goes into rocks that walk.\"    Hale sighed resignedly. There wasn't any use to argue.    \"Unload your _bataloe_,\" he ordered testily, \"and get your filthy  carcasses away.\"    The half-breeds obeyed readily. As the departing _bataloe_ turned from  the _igarape_ into the open water of the river, the young man repressed  a sudden lifting of his scalp. He was in for it now!    His long body sprawled out in the _bataloe_, he paddled about aimlessly  for several minutes until he found an aisle through the jungle--the path  that led to the jungle village which he was visiting in the name of  science, and for a certain award.    Before plunging into that waiting tangle where life and death carried on  a visible, unceasing struggle, he hesitated. Instinctively he shrank  from losing himself in that mad green world.           *       *       *       *       *    He had first heard of the Ungapuks at the convention of the Nescience  Club in New York, that body of scientists, near-scientists and  adventurers linked together for the purpose of awarding the yearly  Woolman prizes for the most spectacular addition of empiric facts to  various branches of science. One of the members of the club, an  explorer, had told a wild yarn about a tribe of Brazilian Indians,  headed by Sir Basil Addington, an English scientist, who was conducting  secret experiments in biochemistry in his jungle laboratory. The  explorer had said that the scientist, half-crazed by a powerful  narcotic, had seemingly discovered some secret of life which enabled him  to produce monsters in his laboratory and to change the physical  characteristics of the Ungapuk Indians, who, in five years, had been  transformed from cannibals into cultured men and women.    And now Hale Oakham, hoping to win one of the Woolman prizes, was here  in the country of the Ungapuks, entering the jungle path that lead to  the unknown.    Fifty feet from the _igarape_, the path curved sharply away from a giant  tree. Hale approached the bend with his hand on his gun. Just before he  reached it, he stopped suddenly to listen.    A woman's voice had suddenly broken forth in a wild, incredibly sweet  song. Hale stood entranced, drinking in the heady sounds that stirred  his emotions like _masata_, the jungle intoxicant. The singer  approached the bend in the path, while the young man waited eagerly.    The first sight of her made him gasp. He had expected to see an Indian  girl. No sane traveler would imagine a white woman in the Amazon jungle,  with skin as amazingly pale as the great, fleshy victoria regia lilies  in the _igarape_.    When she saw Hale, she stopped instantly. With a quick, practiced twist,  she reached for the bow flung across her shoulders and fitted a barbed  arrow to the string.           *       *       *       *       *    She was a beautiful barbarian, standing quivering before him. In the  thick dull gold braids hanging over her bare shoulders flamed two  enormous scarlet flowers, no redder than her own lips pouted in alarm.  There was a savage brevity to her clothing, which consisted only of a  short skirt of rough native grass and breastplates of beaten gold, held  in place by strings of colored seeds.    The girl held out an imperious hand and, in perfect English, said:    \"Go back!\"    Hale drew his long body up to its slim height, folded his arms, and gave  her his most winning smile. His insolence added to his wholesome good  looks.    \"Why?\" he exclaimed. \"I've come a couple of thousand miles to call on  you.\"    He saw that the eyes which held his levelly were pure and limpid, and of  an astonishing orchid-blue.    \"Who are you?\" Her throaty, vibrant voice was a thing of the flesh,  whipping Hale's senses to sudden madness.    \"I'm Hale Oakham,\" he said, a little tremulously, \"a lone, would-be  scientist knocking about the jungle. Won't you tell me your name?\"    She nodded gravely. \"I am Ana. I, too, am white.\" Her rich voice was  quietly proud. \"Come; I'll see if Aimu will receive you.\"    With surprising, childlike trust, she held out her little hand to him.  The gesture was so delightfully natural that Hale, grinning boyishly,  took her hand and held it as they walked down the jungle path.    \"Sing for me,\" he demanded abruptly. \"Sing the song you sang just now.\"    \"That?\" asked the girl, turning the virgin-blue fire of her eyes on him.  \"That was my death-song that I practice each day. Perhaps soon I shall  be released from this.\" She passed her hands over her beautiful,  half-clothed body.           *       *       *       *       *    Hale's warm glance swept over her. \"Do you want to die?\"    \"Yes; don't you? But you do not, or you would not"]]]
