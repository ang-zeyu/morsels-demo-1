UNITED          PREFACE      MY DEAR LADS,    Living in the present days of peace and tranquillity it is difficult to  picture the life of our ancestors in the days of King Alfred, when the  whole country was for years overrun by hordes of pagan barbarians, who  slaughtered, plundered, and destroyed at will. You may gain, perhaps, a  fair conception of the state of things if you imagine that at the time  of the great mutiny the English population of India approached that of  the natives, and that the mutiny was everywhere triumphant. The  wholesale massacres and outrages which would in such a case have been  inflicted upon the conquered whites could be no worse than those  suffered by the Saxons at the hands of the Danes. From this terrible  state of subjection and suffering the Saxons were rescued by the  prudence, the patience, the valour and wisdom of King Alfred. In all  subsequent ages England has produced no single man who united in  himself so many great qualities as did this first of great Englishmen.  He was learned, wise, brave, prudent, and pious; devoted to his people,  clement to his conquered enemies. He was as great in peace as in war;  and yet few English boys know more than a faint outline of the events  of Alfred's reign--events which have exercised an influence upon the  whole future of the English people. School histories pass briefly over  them; and the incident of the burned cake is that which is, of all the  actions of a great and glorious reign, the most prominent in boys'  minds. In this story I have tried to supply the deficiency. Fortunately  in the Saxon Chronicles and in the life of King Alfred written by his  friend and counsellor Asser, we have a trustworthy account of the  events and battles which first laid Wessex prostrate beneath the foot  of the Danes, and finally freed England for many years from the  invaders. These histories I have faithfully followed. The account of  the siege of Paris is taken from a very full and detailed history of  that event by the Abbe D'Abbon, who was a witness of the scenes he  described.    Yours sincerely,    G. A. HENTY          CHAPTER I: THE FUGITIVES      A low hut built of turf roughly thatched with rushes and standing on  the highest spot of some slightly raised ground. It was surrounded by a  tangled growth of bushes and low trees, through which a narrow and  winding path gave admission to the narrow space on which the hut stood.  The ground sloped rapidly. Twenty yards from the house the trees  ceased, and a rank vegetation of reeds and rushes took the place of the  bushes, and the ground became soft and swampy. A little further pools  of stagnant water appeared among the rushes, and the path abruptly  stopped at the edge of a stagnant swamp, though the passage could be  followed by the eye for some distance among the tall rushes. The hut,  in fact, stood on a hummock in the midst of a wide swamp where the  water sometimes deepened into lakes connected by sluggish streams.    On the open spaces of water herons stalked near the margin, and great  flocks of wild-fowl dotted the surface. Other signs of life there were  none, although a sharp eye might have detected light threads of smoke  curling up here and there from spots where the ground rose somewhat  above the general level. These slight elevations, however, were not  visible to the eye, for the herbage here grew shorter than on the lower  and wetter ground, and the land apparently stretched away for a vast  distance in a dead flat--a rush-covered swamp, broken only here and  there by patches of bushes and low trees.    The little hut was situated in the very heart of the fen country, now  drained and cultivated, but in the year 870 untouched by the hand of  man, the haunt of wild-fowl and human fugitives. At the door of the hut  stood a lad some fourteen years old. His only garment was a short  sleeveless tunic girded in at the waist, his arms and legs were bare;  his head was uncovered, and his hair fell in masses on his shoulders.  In his hand he held a short spear, and leaning against the wall of the  hut close at hand was a bow and quiver of arrows. The lad looked at the  sun, which was sinking towards the horizon.    \"Father is late,\" he said. \"I trust that no harm has come to him and  Egbert. He said he would return to-day without fail; he said three or  four days, and this is the fourth. It is dull work here alone. You  think so, Wolf, don't you, old fellow? And it is worse for you than it  is for me, pent up on this hummock of ground with scarce room to  stretch your limbs.\"    A great wolf-hound, who was lying with his head between his paws by the  embers of a fire in the centre of the hut, raised his head on being  addressed, and uttered a low howl indicative of his agreement with his  master's opinion and his disgust at his present place of abode.    \"Never mind, old fellow,\" the boy continued, \"we sha'n't be here long,  I hope, and then you shall go with me in the woods again and hunt the  wolves to your heart's content.\" The great hound gave a lazy wag of his  tail. \"And now, Wolf, I must go. You lie here and guard the hut while I  am away. Not that you are likely to have any strangers to call in my  absence.\"    The dog rose and stretched himself, and followed his master down the  path until it terminated at the edge of the water. Here he gave a low  whimper as the lad stepped in and waded through the water; then turning  he walked back to the hut and threw himself down at the door. The boy  proceeded for some thirty or forty yards through the water, then paused  and pushed aside the wall of rushes which bordered the passage, and  pulled out a boat which was floating among them.    It was constructed of osier rods neatly woven together into a sort of  basket-work, and covered with an untanned hide with the hairy side in.  It was nearly oval in shape, and resembled a great bowl some three feet  and a half wide and a foot longer. A broad paddle with a long handle  lay in it, and the boy, getting into it and standing erect in the  middle paddled down the strip of water which a hundred yards further  opened out into a broad half a mile long and four or five hundred yards  wide. Beyond moving slowly away as the coracle approached them, the  water-fowl paid but little heed to its appearance.    The boy paddled to the end of the broad, whence a passage, through  which flowed a stream so sluggish that its current could scarce be  detected, led into the next sheet of water. Across the entrance to this  passage floated some bundles of light rushes. These the boy drew out  one by one. Attached to each was a piece of cord which, being pulled  upon, brought to the surface a large cage, constructed somewhat on the  plan of a modern eel or lobster pot. They were baited by pieces of dead  fish, and from them the boy extracted half a score of eels and as many  fish of different kinds.    \"Not a bad haul,\" he said as he lowered the cages to the bottom again.  \"Now let us see what we have got in our pen.\"    He paddled a short way along the broad to a point where a little lane  of water ran up through the rushes. This narrowed rapidly and the lad  got out from his boat into the water, as the coracle could proceed no  further between the lines of rushes. The water was knee-deep and the  bottom soft and oozy. At the end of the creek it narrowed until the  rushes were but a foot apart. They were bent over here, as it would  seem to a superficial observer naturally; but a close examination would  show that those facing each other were tied together where they crossed  at a distance of a couple of feet above the water, forming a sort of  tunnel. Two feet farther on this ceased, and the rushes were succeeded  by lines of strong osier withies, an inch or two apart, arched over and  fastened together. At this point was a sort of hanging door formed of  rushes backed with osiers, and so arranged that at the slightest push  from without the door lifted and enabled a wild-fowl to pass under, but  dropping behind it prevented its exit. The osier tunnel widened out to  a sort of inverted basket three feet in diameter.    On the surface of the creek floated some grain which had been scattered  there the evening before as a bait. The lad left the creek before he  got to the narrower part, and, making a small circuit in the swamp,  came down upon the pen.    \"Good!\" he said, \"I am in luck to-day; here are three fine ducks.\"    Bending the yielding osiers aside, he drew out the ducks one by one,  wrung their necks, and passing their heads through his girdle, made his  way again to the coracle. Then he scattered another handful or two of  grain on the water, sparingly near the mouth of the creek, but more  thickly at the entrance to the trap, and then paddled back again by the  way he had come.    Almost noiselessly as he dipped the paddle in the water, the hound's  quick ear had caught the sound, and he was standing at the edge of the  swamp, wagging his tail in dignified welcome as his master stepped on  to dry land.    \"There, Wolf, what do you think of that? A good score of eels and fish  and three fine wild ducks. That means bones for you with your meal  to-night--not to satisfy your hunger, you know, for they would not be  of much use in that way, but to give a flavour to your supper.

The Track of the Book-Worm.          I.    OBJECTS OF COLLECTION.      Philosophers have made various and ingenious but incomplete attempts to  form a succinct definition of the animal, Man. At first thought it might  seem that a perfect definition would be, an animal who makes collections.  But one must remember that the magpie does this. Yet this definition is as  good as any, and comes nearer exactness than most. What has not the  animal Man collected? Clocks, watches, snuff-boxes, canes, fans, laces,  precious stones, china, coins, paper money, spoons, prints, paintings,  tulips, orchids, hens, horses, match-boxes, postal stamps, miniatures,  violins, show-bills, play-bills, swords, buttons, shoes, china slippers,  spools, birds, butterflies, beetles, saddles, skulls, wigs, lanterns,  book-plates, knockers, crystal balls, shells, penny toys, death-masks,  tea-pots, autographs, rugs, armour, pipes, arrow heads, locks of hair and  key locks, and hats (Jules Verne's \"Tale of a Hat\"), these are some of the  most prominent subjects in search of which the animal Man runs up and down  the earth, and spends time and money without scruple or stint. But all  these curious objects of search fall into insignificance when compared  with the ancient, noble and useful passion for collecting books. One of  the wisest of the human race said, the only earthly immortality is in  writing a book; and the desire to accumulate these evidences of earthly  immortality needs no defense among cultivated men.          II.    WHO HAVE COLLECTED BOOKS.      The mania for book-collecting is by no means a modern disease, but has  existed ever since there were books to gather, and has infected many of  the wisest and most potent names in history. Euripides is ridiculed by  Aristophanes in \"The Frogs\" for collecting books. Of the Roman emperor,  Gordian, who flourished (or rather did not flourish, because he was slain  after a reign of thirty-six days) in the third century, Gibbon says,  \"twenty-two acknowledged concubines and a library of sixty thousand  volumes attested the variety of his inclinations.\" This combination of  uxorious and literary tastes seems to have existed in another monarch of a  later period--Henry VIII.--the seeming disproportion of whose expenditure  of 10,800 pounds for jewels in three years, during which he spent but 100  pounds for books and binding, is explained by the fact that he was  indebted for the contents of his libraries to the plunder of monasteries.  Henry printed a few copies of his book against Luther on vellum. Cicero,  who possessed a superb library, especially rich in Greek, at his villa in  Tusculum, thus describes his favorite acquisitions: \"Books to quicken the  intelligence of youth, delight age, decorate prosperity, shelter and  solace us in adversity, bring enjoyment at home, befriend us out-of-doors,  pass the night with us, travel with us, go into the country with us.\"    Petrarch, who collected books not simply for his own gratification, but  aspired to become the founder of a permanent library at Venice, gave his  books to the Church of St. Mark; but the greater part of them perished  through neglect, and only a small part remains. Boccaccio, anticipating an  early death, offered his library to Petrarch, his dear friend, on his own  terms, to insure its preservation, and the poet promised to care for the  collection in case he survived Boccaccio; but the latter, outliving  Petrarch, bequeathed his books to the Augustinians of Florence, and some  of them are still shown to visitors in the Laurentinian Library. From  Boccaccio's own account of his collection, one must believe his books  quite inappropriate for a monastic library, and the good monks probably  instituted an auto da fe for most of them, like that which befell the  knightly romances in \"Don Quixote.\" Perhaps the naughty story-teller  intended the donation as a covert satire. The walls of the room which  formerly contained Montaigne's books, and is at this day exhibited to  pilgrims, are covered with inscriptions burnt in with branding-irons on  the beams and rafters by the eccentric and delightful essayist. The  author of \"Ivanhoe\" adorned his magnificent library with suits of superb  armor, and luxuriated in demonology and witchcraft. The caustic Swift was  in the habit of annotating his books, and writing on the fly-leaves a  summary opinion of the author's merits; whatever else he had, he owned no  Shakespeare, nor can any reference to him be found in the nineteen volumes  of Swift's works. Military men seem always to have had a passion for  books. To say nothing of the literary and rhetorical tastes of Caesar, \"the  foremost man of all time,\" Frederick the Great had libraries at Sans  Souci, Potsdam, and Berlin, in which he arranged the volumes by classes  without regard to size. Thick volumes he rebound in sections for more  convenient use, and his favorite French authors he sometimes caused to be  reprinted in compact editions to his taste. The great Conde inherited a  valuable library from his father, and enlarged and loved it. Marlborough  had twenty-five books on vellum, all earlier than 1496. The hard-fighting  Junot had a vellum library which sold in London for 1,400 pounds, while  his great master was not too busy in conquering Europe not only to solace  himself in his permanent libraries, and in books which he carried with him  in his expeditions, but to project and actually commence the printing of a  camp library of duodecimo volumes, without margins, and in thin covers, to  embrace some three thousand volumes, and which he had designed to complete  in six years by employing one hundred and twenty compositors and  twenty-five editors, at an outlay of about 163,000 pounds. St. Helena  destroyed this scheme. It is curious to note that Napoleon despised  Voltaire as heartily as Frederick admired him, but gave Fielding and Le  Sage places among his traveling companions; while the Bibliomaniac appears  in his direction to his librarian: \"I will have fine editions and handsome  bindings. I am rich enough for that.\" The main thing that shakes one's  confidence in the correctness of his literary taste is that he was fond of  \"Ossian.\" Julius Caesar also formed a traveling library of forty-four  little volumes, contained in an oak case measuring 16 by 11 by 3 inches,  covered with leather. The books are bound in white vellum, and consist of  history,"]]]
