C. Haddon          In Two Volumes          Preface    In writing this book we have aimed at presenting a clear picture of the  pagan tribes of Borneo as they existed at the close of the nineteenth  century. We have not attempted to embody in it the observations  recorded by other writers, although we have profited by them and have  been guided and aided by them in making our own observations. We have  rather been content to put on record as much information as we have  been able to obtain at first hand, both by direct observation of the  people and of their possessions, customs, and manners, and by means  of innumerable conversations with men and women of many tribes.    The reader has a right to be informed as to the nature of the  opportunities we have enjoyed for collecting our material, and we  therefore make the following personal statement. One of us (C. H.) has  spent twenty-four years as a Civil Officer in the service of the Rajah  of Sarawak; and of this time twenty-one years were spent actually in  Sarawak, while periods of some months were spent from time to time  in visiting neighbouring lands -- Celebes, Sulu Islands, Ternate,  Malay Peninsula, British North Borneo, and Dutch Borneo. Of the  twenty-one years spent in Sarawak, about eighteen were passed in the  Baram district, and the remainder mostly in the Rejang district. In  both these districts, but especially in the Baram, settlements and  representatives of nearly all the principal peoples are to be found;  and the nature of his duties as Resident Magistrate necessitated a  constant and intimate intercourse with all the tribes of the districts,  and many long and leisurely journeys into the far interior, often  into regions which had not previously been explored. Such journeys,  during which the tribesmen are the magistrate's only companions  for many weeks or months, and during which his nights and many of  his days are spent in the houses of the people, afford unequalled  opportunities for obtaining intimate knowledge of them and their  ways. These opportunities have not been neglected; notes have been  written, special questions followed up, photographs taken, and sketches  made, throughout all this period.    In the years 1898 -- 9 the second collaborator (W. McD.) spent the  greater part of a year in the Baram district as a member of the  Cambridge Anthropological Expedition, which, under the leadership  of Dr. A. C. Haddon, went out to the Torres Straits in the year  1897. During this visit we co-operated in collecting material for a  joint paper on the animal cults of Sarawak;[1] and this co-operation,  having proved itself profitable, suggested to us an extension of  our joint program to the form of a book embodying all the information  already to hand and whatever additional information might be obtainable  during the years that one of us was still to spend in Borneo. The  book therefore may be said to have been begun in the year 1898 and  to have been in progress since that time; but it has been put into  shape only during the last few years, when we have been able to come  together for the actual writing of it.    During the year 1899 Dr. A. C. Haddon spent some months in the Baram  district, together with other members of the Cambridge Expedition  (Drs. C. G. Seligmann, C. S. Myers, and Mr. S. Ray); and we wish to  express our obligation to him for the friendly encouragement in, and  stimulating example of, anthropological field work which he afforded  us during that time, as well as for later encouragement and help  which he has given us, especially in reading the proofs of the book  and in making many helpful suggestions. We are indebted to him also  for the Appendix to this book, in which he has stated and discussed  the results of the extensive series of physical measurements of the  natives that he made, with our assistance, during his visit to Sarawak.    We have pleasure in expressing here our thanks to several other  gentlemen to whom we are indebted for help of various kinds -- for  permission to reproduce several photographs, to Dr. A. W. Nieuwenhuis,  the intrepid explorer of the interior of Dutch Borneo, who in his  two fine volumes (QUER DURCH BORNEO) has embodied the observations  recorded during two long journeys in the interior; to Mr. H. Ling Roth  for the gift of the blocks used in the preparation of his well-known  work, THE NATIVES OF SARAWAK AND BRITISH NORTH BORNEO, many of which  we have made use of; to Dr. W. H. Furness, author of THE HOME LIFE  OF BORNEO HEAD-HUNTERS (1902), for several photographic plates made  by him during his visits to the Baram in the years 1897 and 1898;  to Drs. C. G. Seligmann and C. S. Myers for permission to reproduce  several photographs; to Mr. R. Shelford, formerly Curator of the  Sarawak Museum, for his permission to incorporate a large part of  a paper published jointly with one of us (C. H.) on tatu in Borneo,  and for measurements of Land Dayaks made by him; to Mr. R. S. Douglas,  formerly Assistant Officer in the Baram district and now Resident of  the Fourth Division of Sarawak, for practical help genially afforded  on many occasions.    Finally, it is our agreeable duty to acknowledge our obligation to  H.H. the Rajah of Sarawak, who welcomed to his country the members of  the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition, and without whose enlightened  encouragement of scientific work on the part of his officers this  book would never have been written.

Supplementary Preface by one of the Authors    I feel that it is necessary to supplement our joint-preface with some  few words of apology for, and explanation of, the appearance of my  name on the title-page of this book. For the book is essentially an  attempt to set forth in condensed form the mass of knowledge of the  tribes of Borneo acquired by Dr. Hose in the course of a quarter of  a century's intimate study of, and sympathetic companionship with,  the people of the interior. My own part in its production has been  merely that of a midwife, though I may perhaps claim to have helped  in the washing and dressing of the infant as well as in its delivery,  and even to have offered some useful advice during the long years of  pregnancy. And, since it is more difficult to present a brief and  popular account of any complex subject the more intimate is one's  knowledge of it, I may fairly hope that my superficial acquaintance  with the pagan tribes of Borneo has been a useful ally to Dr. Hose's  profound and extensive knowledge of them; I have therefore gladly  accepted my friend's generous invitation to place my name beside his  as joint-author of this work.

NO. 65.\" The volume in question consists of copies of four  original documents; the first two, written by Fernao Nuniz and Domingo  Paes, being those translated below, the last two (at the end of the  MS.) letters written from China about the year 1520 A.D. These will  probably be published in translation by Mr. Donald Ferguson in the  pages of the INDIAN ANTIQUARY.    The first pair of original papers was sent with a covering letter  by some one at Goa to some one in Europe. The names are not given,  but there is every reason for believing that the recipient was the  historian Barros in Lisbon.    Both these papers are in the same handwriting, which fact -- since  they were written by separate Portuguese merchants or travellers at  Vijayanagar in different years, one, I believe, shortly subsequent  to 1520 A.D., the latter not later than about 1536 or 1537 --  conclusively proves them to be copies of the originals, and not the  originals themselves.[2] I have inserted a facsimile of two pages of  the text, so that no doubt may remain on this point. The first portion  consists of the conclusion of the text of Fernao Nuniz; the second  of the covering letter written by the person who sent the originals  to Europe; the third of the beginning of the text of Domingo Paes.    Paes being the earlier in date (about 1520) I have given his account  of personal experiences first, and afterwards the historical summary  composed by Nuniz about the year 1536 or 1537.    I have stated that the person to whom the documents were sent from  Goa was probably the celebrated historian Barros. He is alluded to  in the covering letter in the words: \"It seemed necessary to do what  your Honour desired of me,\" \"I send both the summaries ... because  your Honour can gather what is useful to you from both;\" and at the  end of the long note on \"Togao Mamede,\" king of Delhi, quoted in my  introduction, \"I kiss your Honour's hand.\"    Since the first DECADA of Barros was published in 1552,[3]  this argument is not unreasonable; while a comparison between the  accounts given by Nuniz and Barros of the siege and battle of Raichur  sufficiently proves that one was taken from the other. But we have  fortunately more direct evidence, for the discovery of which we have  to thank Mr. Ferguson. I have mentioned above that at the end of the  MS. volume are copies of two letters concerning China. These were  written subsequent to the year 1520 by Vasco Calvo and Christovao  Vieyra. Mr. Ferguson has pointed out to me that, in the third DECADA  (liv. IV, caps. 4, 5), after quoting some passages almost verbatim  from this chronicle of Nuniz regarding Vijayanagar, Barros writes:  \"According to two letters which our people had two or three years  afterwards from these two men, Vasco Calvo, brother of Diogo Calvo,  and Christovao Vieyra, who were prisoners in Canton, etc....\" He  also mentions these letters in two subsequent passages, and quotes  from them. This renders it certain that Barros saw those letters;  and since they are copied into the same volume which contains the  chronicles of Nuniz and Paes, we may be sure that Barros had the  whole before him. It is of little importance to settle the question  whether the chronicles of Nuniz and Paes were sent direct to Barros  -- whether, that is, Barros himself is the addressee of the covering  letter -- or to some other official (the \"our people\" of the passage  from Barros last quoted); but that Barros saw them seems certain,  and it is therefore most probable that the Paris MS. was a volume of  copies prepared for him from the originals.    * * *    These documents possess peculiar and unique value; that of Paes because  it gives us a vivid and graphic account of his personal experiences  at the great Hindu capital at the period of its highest grandeur and  magnificence -- \"things which I saw and came to know\" he tells us --  and that of Nuniz because it contains the traditional history of the  country gathered first-hand on the spot, and a narrative of local  and current events of the highest importance, known to him either  because he himself was present or because he received the information  from those who were so. The summaries of the well-known historians  already alluded to, though founded, as I believe, partly on these  very chronicles, have taken all the life out of them by eliminating  the personal factor, the presence of which in the originals gives  them their greatest charm. Senhor Lopes, who has published these  documents in the original Portuguese in a recent work,[4] writes in his  introduction: \"Nothing that we know of in any language can compare with  them, whether for their historical importance or for the description  given of the country, and especially of the capital, its products,  customs, and the like. The Italian travellers who visited and wrote  about this country -- Nicolo di Conti, Varthema, and Federici --  are much less minute in the matter of the geography and customs of  the land, and not one of them has left us a chronicle.\" They are  indeed invaluable, and throw an extraordinary light on the condition  of Vijayanagar as well as on several doubtful points of history.    Thus, for instance, we have in Nuniz for the first time a definite  account of the events that led to the fall of the First Dynasty and the  establishment of the second by the usurpation of Narasimha. Previous  to the publication of these chronicles by Senhor Lopes we had nothing  to guide us in this matter, save a few vague and unsatisfactory lines  in the chronicle of the historian Firishtah.[5] Now all is made clear,  and though as yet the truth cannot be definitely determined, at least  we have an explicit and exceedingly interesting story. Paes too,  as well as Nuniz, conclusively proves to us that Krishna Deva Raya  was really the greatest of all the kings of Vijayanagar, and not the  mere puppet that Firishtah appears to consider him (Firishtah does not  mention him by name); for Paes saw him on several occasions and speaks  of him in warm and glowing terms, while Nuniz, whose narrative was  evidently firsthand, never so much as hints that his armies were led  to victory by any other general but the king himself. Nuniz also gives  us a graphic description from personal knowledge of the character of  Krishna's degenerate successor Achyuta, whose feebleness, selfishness,  cowardice, and cruelty paved the way for the final destruction of  the great empire.    By the side of these two chronicles the writings of the great European  historians seem cold and lifeless.    * * *    I have mentioned the publication of Senhor Lopes. It is to that  distinguished Arabic scholar that we owe the knowledge of the existence  of these precious documents. He it was who brought them to light  in the first instance, and to him personally I owe the fact of my  being able to translate and publish them. His introduction to the DOS  REIS DE BISNAGA is full of valuable matter. India owes him a debt of  gratitude for his services; and for myself I desire to record here  my sincere thanks for the disinterested and generous help he has so  constantly accorded to me during the last two years.    My thanks are also due to Mr. Donald Ferguson for his careful revision  of the whole of my translations.    I desire further to express my appreciation of a particular kindness  done to me by Colonel R. C. Temple, C.I.E., and lastly to acknowledge  gratefully the liberality of H.E. the Governor of Madras and the  Members of his Council, who by subsidising this work have rendered  its publication possible.    I trust that my remarks regarding the causes of the downfall of  Portuguese trade in the sixteenth century will not be misunderstood. It  is not in any spirit of criticism or comparison that I have written  those passages. History, however, is history; and it is a fact that  while the main cause of the small success which attended the efforts  of the Portuguese to establish a great and lasting commerce with India  was no doubt the loss of trade after the destruction of Vijayanagar,  there must be added to this by the impartial recorder the dislike of  the inhabitants to the violence and despotism of the Viceroys and to  the uncompromising intolerance of the Jesuit Fathers, as well as the  horror engendered in their minds by the severities of the terrible  Inquisition at Goa.    * * *    A word as to my spelling of names. I have adopted a medium course  in many cases between the crudities of former generations and the  scientific requirements of the age in which we live; the result of  which will probably be my condemnation by both parties. But to the  highly educated I would point out that this work is intended for  general reading, and that I have therefore thought it best to avoid  the use of a special font of type containing the proper diacritical  points; while to the rest I venture to present the plea that the  time has passed when Vijayanagar needs to be spelt \"Beejanuggur,\"  or Kondavidu \"Condbeer.\"    Thus I have been bold enough to drop the final and essential \"a\"  of the name of the great city, and spell the word \"Vijayanagar,\"  as it is usually pronounced by the English. The name is composed  of two words, VIJAYA, \"victory,\" and NAGARA, \"city,\" all the \"a's\"  to be pronounced short, like the \"u\" in \"sun,\" or the \"a\" in \"organ.\"    \"Narasimha\" ought, no doubt, to be spelt \"Nrisimha,\" but that in such  case the \"ri\" ought to have a dot under the \"r\" as the"]]]
