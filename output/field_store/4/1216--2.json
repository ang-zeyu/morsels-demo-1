Interest rather than unity of  thought has determined the selection.    A prominent theme in the collection is that of the structure, extent,  and duration of the universe.

Acknowledgment is due to the proprietors of the various periodicals  from the pages of which most of the essays have been taken. Besides  Harper's Magazine and the North American Review, these include  McClure's Magazine, from which were taken the articles \"The Unsolved  Problems of Astronomy\" and \"How the Planets are Weighed.\" \"The  Structure of the Universe\" appeared in the International Monthly, now  the International Quarterly; \"The Outlook for the Flying-Machine\" is  mainly from The New York Independent, but in part from McClure's  Magazine; \"The World's Debt to Astronomy\" is from The Chautauquan; and  \"An Astronomical Friendship\" from the Atlantic Monthly.    SIMON NEWCOMB. WASHINGTON, JUNE, 1906.          I    THE UNSOLVED PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY      The reader already knows what the solar system is: an immense central  body, the sun, with a number of planets revolving round it at various  distances. On one of these planets we dwell. Vast, indeed, are the  distances of the planets when measured by our terrestrial standards. A  cannon-ball fired from the earth to celebrate the signing of the  Declaration of Independence, and continuing its course ever since with  a velocity of eighteen hundred feet per second, would not yet be  half-way to the orbit of Neptune, the outer planet. And yet the  thousands of stars which stud the heavens are at distances so much  greater than that of Neptune that our solar system is like a little  colony, separated from the rest of the universe by an ocean of void  space almost immeasurable in extent. The orbit of the earth round the  sun is of such size that a railway train running sixty miles an hour,  with never a stop, would take about three hundred and fifty years to  cross it. Represent this orbit by a lady's finger-ring. Then the  nearest fixed star will be about a mile and a half away; the next more  than two miles; a few more from three to twenty miles; the great body  at scores or hundreds of miles. Imagine the stars thus scattered from  the Atlantic to the Mississippi, and keep this little finger-ring in  mind as the orbit of the earth, and one may have some idea of the  extent of the universe.    One of the most beautiful stars in the heavens, and one that can be  seen most of the year, is a Lyrae, or Alpha of the Lyre, known also as  Vega. In a spring evening it may be seen in the northeast, in the later  summer near the zenith, in the autumn in the northwest. On the scale we  have laid down with the earth's orbit as a finger-ring, its distance  would be some eight or ten miles. The small stars around it in the same  constellation are probably ten, twenty, or fifty times as far.    Now, the greatest fact which modern science has brought to light is  that our whole solar system, including the sun, with all its planets,  is on a journey towards the constellation Lyra. During our whole lives,  in all probability during the whole of human history, we have been  flying unceasingly towards this beautiful constellation with a speed to  which no motion on earth can compare. The speed has recently been  determined with a fair degree of certainty, though not with entire  exactness; it is about ten miles a second, and therefore not far from  three hundred millions of miles a year. But whatever it may be, it is  unceasing and unchanging; for us mortals eternal. We are nearer the  constellation by five or six hundred miles every minute we live; we are  nearer to it now than we were ten years ago by thousands of millions of  miles, and every future generation of our race will be nearer than its  predecessor by thousands of millions of miles.    When, where, and how, if ever, did this journey begin--when, where, and  how, if ever, will it end? This is the greatest of the unsolved  problems of astronomy. An astronomer who should watch the heavens for  ten thousand years might gather some faint suggestion of an answer, or  he might not. All we can do is to seek for some hints by study and  comparison with other stars.    The stars are suns. To put it in another way, the sun is one of the  stars, and rather a small one at that. If the sun is moving in the way  I have described, may not the stars also be in motion, each on a  journey of its own through the wilderness of space? To this question  astronomy gives an affirmative answer. Most of the stars nearest to us  are found to be in motion, some faster than the sun, some more slowly,  and the same is doubtless true of all; only the century of accurate  observations at our disposal does not show the motion of the distant  ones. A given motion seems slower the more distant the moving body; we  have to watch a steamship on the horizon some little time to see that  she moves at all. Thus it is that the unsolved problem of the motion of  our sun is only one branch of a yet more stupendous one: What mean the  motions of the stars--how did they begin, and how, if ever, will they  end? So far as we can yet see, each star is going straight ahead on its  own journey, without regard to its neighbors, if other stars can be so  called. Is each describing some vast orbit which, though looking like a  straight line during the short period of our observation, will really  be seen to curve after ten thousand or a hundred thousand years, or  will it go straight on forever? If the laws of motion are true for all  space and all time, as we are forced to believe, then each moving star  will go on in an unbending line forever unless hindered by the  attraction of other stars. If they go on thus, they must, after  countless years, scatter in all directions, so that the inhabitants of  each shall see only a black, starless sky.    Mathematical science can throw only a few glimmers of light on the  questions thus suggested. From what little we know of the masses,  distances, and numbers of the stars we see a possibility that the more  slow-moving ones may, in long ages, be stopped in their onward courses  or brought into orbits of some sort by the attraction of their millions  of fellows. But it is hard to admit even this possibility in the case  of the swift-moving ones. Attraction, varying as the inverse square of  the distance, diminishes so rapidly as the distance increases that, at  the distances which separate the stars, it is small indeed. We could  not, with the most delicate balance that science has yet invented, even  show the attraction of the greatest known star. So far as we know, the  two swiftest-moving stars are, first, Arcturus, and, second, one known  in astronomy as 1830 Groombridge, the latter so called because it was  first observed by the astronomer Groombridge, and is numbered 1830 in  his catalogue of stars. If our determinations of the distances of these  bodies are to be relied on, the velocity of their motion cannot be much  less than two hundred miles a second. They would make the circuit of  the earth every two or three minutes. A body massive enough to control  this motion would throw a large part of the universe into disorder.  Thus the problem where these stars came from and where they are going  is for us insoluble, and is all the more so from the fact that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4069"],[0,"The Dawn of Canadian History : A Chronicle of Aboriginal Canada (#1)"],[1,"OF CANADA    Edited by George M.

In one sense, of course,  this is true. The settlement of Europeans on Canadian soil dates back  only three hundred years. Civilization in Canada is but a thing of  yesterday, and its written history, when placed beside the long  millenniums of the recorded annals of European and Eastern peoples,  seems but a little span.    But there is another sense in which the Dominion of Canada, or at least  part of it, is perhaps the oldest country in the world. According to  the Nebular Theory the whole of our planet was once a fiery molten mass  gradually cooling and hardening itself into the globe we know. On its  surface moved and swayed a liquid sea glowing with such a terrific heat  that we can form no real idea of its intensity. As the mass cooled,  vast layers of vapour, great beds of cloud, miles and miles in  thickness, were formed and hung over the face of the globe, obscuring  from its darkened surface the piercing beams of the sun. Slowly the  earth cooled, until great masses of solid matter, rock as we call it,  still penetrated with intense heat, rose to the surface of the boiling  sea. Forces of inconceivable magnitude moved through the mass. The  outer surface of the globe as it cooled ripped and shrivelled like a  withering orange.  Great ridges, the mountain chains of to-day, were  furrowed on its skin. Here in the darkness of the prehistoric night  there arose as the oldest part of the surface of the earth the great  rock bed that lies in a huge crescent round the shores of Hudson Bay,  from Labrador to the unknown wilderness of the barren lands of the  Coppermine basin touching the Arctic sea. The wanderer who stands  to-day in the desolate country of James Bay or Ungava is among the  oldest monuments of the world. The rugged rock which here and there  breaks through the thin soil of the infertile north has lain on the  spot from the very dawn of time. Millions of years have probably  elapsed since the cooling of the outer crust of the globe produced the  solid basis of our continents.    The ancient formation which thus marks the beginnings of the solid  surface of the globe is commonly called by geologists the Archaean  rock, and the myriads of uncounted years during which it slowly took  shape are called the Archaean age. But the word 'Archaean' itself tells  us nothing, being merely a Greek term meaning 'very old.' This Archaean  or original rock must necessarily have extended all over the surface of  our sphere as it cooled from its molten form and contracted into the  earth on which we live. But in most places this rock lies deep under  the waters of the oceans, or buried below the heaped up strata of the  formations which the hand of time piled thickly upon it. Only here and  there can it still be seen as surface rock or as rock that lies but a  little distance below the soil. In Canada, more than anywhere else in  the world, is this Archaean formation seen. On a geological map it is  marked as extending all round the basin of Hudson Bay, from Labrador to  the shores of the Arctic. It covers the whole of the country which we  call New Ontario, and also the upper part of the province of Quebec.  Outside of this territory there was at the dawn of time no other 'land'  where North America now is, except a long island of rock that marks the  backbone of what are now the Selkirk Mountains and a long ridge that is  now the mountain chain of the Alleghanies beside the Atlantic slope.    Books on geology trace out for us the long successive periods during  which the earth's surface was formed. Even in the Archaean age  something in the form of life may have appeared. Perhaps vast masses of  dank seaweed germinated as the earliest of plants in the steaming  oceans. The water warred against the land, tearing and breaking at its  rock formation and distributing it in new strata, each buried beneath  the next and holding fast within it the fossilized remains that form  the record of its history. Huge fern plants spread their giant fronds  in the dank sunless atmospheres, to be buried later in vast beds of  decaying vegetation that form the coal-fields of to-day.    Animal life began first, like the plants, in the bosom of the ocean.  From the slimy depths of the water life crawled hideous to the land.  Great reptiles dragged their sluggish length through the tangled  vegetation of the jungle of giant ferns.    Through countless thousands of years, perhaps, this gradual process  went on. Nature, shifting its huge scenery, depressed the ocean beds  and piled up the dry land of the continents. In place of the vast  'Continental Sea,' which once filled the interior of North America,  there arose the great plateau or elevated plain that now runs from the  Mackenzie basin to the Gulf of Mexico. Instead of the rushing waters of  the inland sea, these waters have narrowed into great rivers--the  Mackenzie, the Saskatchewan, the Mississippi--that swept the face of  the plateau and wore down the surface of the rock and mountain slopes  to spread their powdered fragments on the broad level soil of the  prairies of the west. With each stage in the evolution of the land the  forms of life appear to have reached a higher development. In place of  the seaweed and the giant ferns of the dawn of time there arose the  maples, the beeches, and other waving trees that we now see in the  Canadian woods. The huge reptiles in the jungle of the Carboniferous  era passed out of existence. In place of them came the birds, the  mammals,--the varied types of animal life which we now know. Last in  the scale of time and highest in point of evolution, there appeared man.    We must not speak of the continents as having been made once and for  all in their present form. No doubt in the countless centuries of  geological evolution various parts of the earth were alternately raised  and depressed. Great forests grew, and by some convulsion were buried  beneath the ocean, covered deep as they lay there with a sediment of  earth and rock, and at length raised again as the waters retreated. The  coal-beds of Cape Breton are the remains of a forest buried beneath the  sea. Below the soil of Alberta is a vast jungle of vegetation, a dense  mass of giant fern trees. The Great Lakes were once part of a much  vaster body of water, far greater in extent than they now are. The  ancient shore-line of Lake Superior may be traced five hundred feet  above its present level.    In that early period the continents and islands which we now see wholly  separated were joined together at various points. The British islands  formed a connected part of Europe. The Thames and the Rhine were one  and the same river, flowing towards the Arctic ocean over a plain that  is now the shallow sunken bed of the North Sea. It is probable that  during the last great age, the Quaternary, as geologists call it, the  upheaval of what is now the region of Siberia and Alaska, made a  continuous chain of land from Asia to America. As the land was  depressed again it left behind it the islands in the Bering Sea, like  stepping-stones from shore to shore. In the same way, there was perhaps  a solid causeway of land from Canada to Europe reaching out across the  Northern Atlantic. Baffin Island and other islands of the Canadian  North Sea, the great sub-continent of Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe  Islands, and the British Isles, all formed part of this continuous  chain.    As the last of the great changes, there came the Ice Age, which  profoundly affected the climate and soil of Canada, and, when the ice  retreated, left its surface much as we see it now. During this period  the whole of Canada from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains lay buried  under a vast sheet of ice. Heaped up in immense masses over the frozen  surface of the Hudson Bay country, the ice, from its own dead weight,  slid sidewise to the south. As it went it ground down the surface of  the land into deep furrows and channels; it cut into the solid rock  like a moving plough, and carried with it enormous masses of loose  stone and boulders which it threw broadcast over the face of the  country. These stones and boulders were thus carried forty and fifty,  and in some cases many hundred miles before they were finally loosed  and dropped from the sheet of moving ice. In Ontario and Quebec and New  England great stones of the glacial drift are found which weigh from  one thousand to seven thousand tons. They are deposited in some cases  on what is now the summit of hills and mountains, showing how deep the  sheet of ice must have been that could thus cover the entire surface of  the country, burying alike the valleys and the hills. The mass of ice  that moved slowly, century by century, across the face of Southern  Canada to New England is estimated to have been in places a mile thick.  The limit to which it was carried went far south of the boundaries of  Canada. The path of the glacial drift is traced by geologists as far  down the Atlantic coast as the present site of New York, and in the  central plain of the continent it extended to what is now the state of  Missouri.    Facts seem to support the theory that before the Great Ice Age the  climate of the northern part of Canada was very different from what it  is now. It is very probable that a warm if not a torrid climate  extended for hundreds of miles northward of the now habitable limits of  the Dominion."]]]
