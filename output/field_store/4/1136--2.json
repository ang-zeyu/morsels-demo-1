The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaims the  restoration of the Gospel and the re-establishment of the Church as of  old, in this, the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. Such  restoration and re-establishment, with the modern bestowal of the Holy  Priesthood, would be unnecessary and indeed impossible had the Church  of Christ continued among men with unbroken succession of Priesthood  and power, since the \"meridian of time.\"    The restored Church affirms that a general apostasy developed during  and after the apostolic period, and that the primitive Church lost its  power, authority, and graces as a divine institution, and degenerated  into an earthly organization only. The significance and importance of  the great apostasy, as a condition precedent to the re-establishment  of the Church in modern times, is obvious. If the alleged apostasy of  the primitive Church was not a reality, the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints is not the divine institution its name proclaims.    The evidence of the decline and final extinction of the primitive  Church among men is found in scriptural record and in secular history.  In the following pages the author has undertaken to present a summary  of the most important of these evidences. In so doing he has drawn  liberally from many sources of information, with due acknowledgment of  all citations. This little work has been written in the hope that it  may prove of service to our missionary elders in the field, to classes  and quorum organizations engaged in the study of theological subjects  at home, and to earnest investigators of the teachings and claims of  the restored Church of Jesus Christ.    Salt Lake City, Utah,                     JAMES E. TALMAGE.      November 1, 1909.      PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.      The first edition of \"The Great Apostasy\" was issued by the Deseret  News, Salt Lake City, in November, 1909, and comprised ten thousand  copies. The author has learned, with a pleasure that is perhaps  pardonable, of the favorable reception accorded the little work by the  missionary elders of the Church, and by the people among whom these  devoted servants are called to labor. The present issue of twenty  thousand copies constitutes the second edition, and is published  primarily for use in the missionary field. The text of the second  edition is practically identical with that of the first.    Salt Lake City, Utah,                     JAMES E. TALMAGE.      February, 1910.          CONTENTS.

A belief common to all sects and churches professing Christianity  is that Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the human race,  established His Church upon the earth by personal ministration in the  meridian of time. Ecclesiastical history, as distinguished from  secular history, deals with the experiences of the Church from the  time of its establishment. The conditions under which the Church was  founded first claim our attention.    2. At the beginning of the Christian era, the Jews, in common with  most other nations, were subjects of the Roman empire.--(See Note 1,  end of chapter.)

PREFACE.      Most of the books intended to give \"counsel and ghostly strength\" to  newly-married people are so like a collection of sermons that they are  given away rather than read. When writing the following pages I have  remembered that the only kind of vice all people agree to shun  is--advice, and have endeavoured to hide the pill. This is my excuse if  at times I seem to fall into anecdotage.    One day two birds were busy building their nest in Luther's garden.  Observing that they were often scared while committing their petty  thefts by the passers to and fro, the Doctor exclaimed, \"Oh, poor little  birds! fly not away; I wish you well with all my heart, if you would  only believe me!\" If any birds of Paradise, or, to speak plainly,  newly-married people, are a little scared by the title of this book or  by any of its contents, I assure them that, while trying to place before  them the responsibilities they have undertaken, I wish them well with  all my heart, and take great interest in their nest-building.    To ask critics to be merciful at a time when new books are so numerous  that our eyes ache with reading and our fingers with turning the pages,  would be to ask them not to do their duty. They are the policemen of  literature, and they are bound to make bad and worthless books \"move on\"  out of the way of their betters. I can only hope that if any notice this  little venture they may not feel obliged to \"crush\" it \"among the  stoure,\" as the Ayrshire ploughman had to crush the \"wee, modest,  crimson-tipped flower.\"    I take this opportunity of thanking M. H., my best friend, without whose  help and sympathy this book would be a worse one than it is, and my life  much more unsatisfactory.    Part of the first chapter was published in _Chambers's Journal_, and I  am indebted to _Cassell's Saturday Journal_ for two anecdotes. I now  tender my best thanks to the proprietors of those periodicals for  permission to reprint the passages.          PREFACE    TO THE SECOND EDITION.      The \"wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower,\" as I called this book when it  first made its appearance, has not been crushed with the ploughshare of  criticism \"among the stoure.\" On the contrary, it has been so well  received that I am full of gratitude to the reviewers who recommended it  and to the public who bought it. One critic suggested that to make the  work complete a chapter on second marriages should be added. My reason  for not writing such a chapter is that, not having myself been as yet  often married, I did not presume to give advice to widows and widowers  who have their own experience to guide them.    Taking up the book in a lending library a friend read aloud the title to  a lady who accompanied her--\"How to be Happy though Married.\" _Lady_:  \"Oh, bother the happiness; does it tell how to be married?\" I hope that  I may be pardoned if I cannot always do this.

HOW TO BE HAPPY _THOUGH_ MARRIED.      \"How delicious is the winning    Of a kiss at love's beginning,    When two mutual hearts are sighing    For the knot there's no untying!\"--_T. Campbell._         \"Deceive not thyself by over-expecting happiness in the married       state. Look not therein for contentment greater than God will       give, or a creature in this world can receive, namely, to be free       from all inconveniences. Marriage is not like the hill Olympus,       wholly clear, without clouds.\"--_Fuller._      \"How to be happy _though_ married.\" This was the quaint title of one of  Skelton's sermons, which would certainly cause a momentary cloud of  indignation, not to say of alarm, to pass over the minds of a  newly-married couple, should they discover it when skimming through a  collection of old volumes on the first wet day of their honeymoon.    \"Two young persons thrown together by chance, or brought together by  artifice, exchange glances, reciprocate civilities, and go home to dream  of each other. Finding themselves rather uncomfortable apart, they  think they necessarily must be happy together.\" But there is no such  necessity. In marriage the measure of our happiness is usually in  proportion to our deserts.      \"No man e'er gained a happy life by chance,    Or yawned it into being with a wish.\"    This, however, is just what many novices think they can do in reference  to matrimony. They fancy that it has a magic power of conferring  happiness almost in spite of themselves, and are quite surprised when  experience teaches them that domestic felicity,"]]]
