[_All rights reserved._]          TO MY DEAR WIFE,      Alice Mary,      I DEDICATE THIS BOOK,      IN TOKEN OF MY APPRECIATION OF HER GENTLE AND TENDER      KINDNESS TOWARDS ALL ANIMAL LIFE,      MORE PARTICULARLY      \"THE CAT.\"      \"_Iddesleigh,\" Sevenoaks._          PREFACE.                     \"What is aught, but as 'tis valued?\"                                      _Troilus and Cressida_, Act II.      The following notes and illustrations of and respecting the Cat are the  outcome of over fifty years' careful, thoughtful, heedful observation,  much research, and not unprofitable attention to the facts and fancies  of others. From a tiny child to the present, the love of Nature has been  my chief delight; animals and birds have not only been objects of study,  but of deep and absorbing interest. I have noted their habits, watched  their ways, and found lasting pleasure in their companionship. This love  of animal life and Nature, with all its moods and phases, has grown with  me from childhood to manhood, and is not the least enjoyable part of my  old age.    Among animals possibly the most perfect, and certainly the most  domestic, is the Cat. I did not think so always, having had a bias  against it, and was some time coming to this belief; nevertheless, such  is the fact. It is a veritable part of our household, and is both  useful, quiet, affectionate, and ornamental. The small or large dog may  be regarded and petted, but is generally _useless_; the Cat, a pet or  not, _is of service_. Were it not for our Cats, rats and mice would  overrun our house, buildings, cultivated and other lands. If there were  not _millions_ of Cats, there would be _billions_ of vermin.    Long ages of neglect, ill-treatment, and absolute cruelty, with little  or no gentleness, kindness, or training, have made the Cat  self-reliant; and from this emanates the marvellous powers of  observation, the concentration of which has produced a state analogous  to reasoning, not unmixed with timidity, caution, wildness, and a  retaliative nature.    But should a new order of things arise, and it is nurtured, petted,  cosseted, talked to, noticed, and _trained_, with mellowed firmness and  tender gentleness, then in but a few generations much evil that bygone  cruelty has stamped into its often wretched existence will disappear,  and it will be more than ever not only a useful, serviceable helpmate,  but an object of increasing interest, admiration, and cultured beauty,  and, thus being of value, profitable.    Having said this much, I turn to the pleasurable duty of recording my  deep sense of the kindness of those warm-hearted friends who have  assisted me in \"my labour of love,\" not the least among these being  those publishers, who, with a generous and prompt alacrity, gave me  permission to make extracts, excerpts, notes, and quotations from the  following high-class works, their property. My best thanks are due to  Messrs. Longmans & Co., Blaine's \"Encyclopaedia of British Sports;\" Allen  & Co., Rev. J. F.

Charles Dickens & Evans.                                                             HARRISON WEIR.    \"IDDESLEIGH,\" SEVENOAKS,         _May_ 5_th_, 1889.          PREFACE TO NEW EDITION.                  \"'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.\"                                                    _Othello._      Some time has passed since I published my book, \"Our Cats and all about  them,\" in 1889, and much has taken place regarding these household pets.  All know as well as myself that each and everything about us changes,  nothing stands still; that which is of to-day is past, and that which  was hidden often revealed, sometimes by mere accident, at others by  scientific research; but one was scarcely prepared in any way for so  wonderful \"a find\" as that of the large number of \"mummy\" Cats at Beni  Hassan, Central Egypt. They were discovered by an Egyptian fellah,  employed in husbandry, who tumbled into a pit which, on further  examination, proved to be a large subterranean cave completely filled  with mummy Cats, every one of which had been separately embalmed and  wrapped in cloth, after the manner of the Egyptian human mummies, all  being laid out carefully in rows; and here they had lain probably about  three or four thousand years. The \"totem\" of a section of the ancients,  as is well known, was the Cat; hence when a Cat died it was buried with  due honours, being embalmed, and often decorated in various ways, and,  in short, had as much attention paid to it as a human being. It had long  been believed that a Cat cemetery existed on the east bank of the Nile,  and in the autumn of 1889 the lucky Egyptian, about 100 miles from  Cairo, came unexpectedly upon it.    Immediately on \"the find\" becoming known, \"specimen\" mummy Cats were  written for to agents in Egypt, one friend of mine sending for four, and  it appeared for a while that much money would be realised by the owner  of the cave or land in this way; but the number was too great, and the  prices and the interest gave way, and, sad to relate, these former  \"Deities\" were dug out of their resting-place by hundreds of thousands,  and quickly sold to local farmers, being used for enriching the land.  Other lots found their way to an Alexandrian merchant, and were by him  sent to Liverpool on board the steamer _Pharos and Thebes_.    The consignment consisted of 19-1/2 tons, and were sold by auction, mostly  being bought by a local \"fertiliser\" merchant. The auction was only  known to the trade, and the lots were \"knocked down\" at the \"giving  away\" sums of L3 13_s._ 9_d._, L3 17_s._, to L4 5_s._ _per ton_, the big  and the perfect ones being picked out for the museum and private  collections. The broker who sold used a head of one of these Cats in  lieu of an auctioneer's hammer. And now these tons of \"deified\" Cats are  used for manure, and in our English soil plants grow into them, and on  them, and of them; and, if it be true, as chemists assert, these plants  take into their system that on which they feed, and so, if so, possibly  in our very bread that we have eaten, we have swallowed \"_a little_ at a  time part of if not the whole of a deified cat.\"    I made several endeavours to find out from those on the spot at  Liverpool whether there was any hair of colours in existence among the  mass of bodies; but in no case could I succeed in getting any, as I had  hoped by this means to possibly come to some conclusion as to the kind  or breed. Of course, it is well known from mummies long in this country  what form, size, and general appearance the Egyptian possessed; but as  yet, as far as I can learn, no one has found so much, if any, of the fur  as to be able to determine the colour.    Apropos with the above, as applying the bodies of the mummy Cats for  manure, comes the modern idea of keeping Cats for their fur. It is  stated that a company has been formed in America for that purpose in  Washington, and an island of some size has been bought or leased for  the purpose. The intention is to raise entirely black Cats; and as their  place of abode will be surrounded by water, it is conjectured that after  the first importation they will go on propagating and producing only  Cats of that beautiful though sombre dark hue. The Cats with which the  island is to be stocked are to be procured from Holland, where already  the \"industry\" is \"at work.\" So much so that a friend of mine, an  elderly gentleman, sending to a furrier in Holland to know what kind of  fur he would recommend as the best for warmth, received the reply that  Cats' skins \"were the most useful and warmest.\" A few days ago he called  on me wrapped in a cloth coat, with fur collar and cuffs, and _lining  throughout of black Cats' skins_, and I am bound to say that the general  appearance was much in its favour; he also stated that he was in every  way perfectly satisfied.    By-the-bye, the Cat Company intend to feed their Cats on fish, which  abound about the shores of their island, and so they affirm the food  will cost nothing, and their profits consequently be very large. But in  this I hope they have been well informed as to the adaptability of the  Cat to feed _entirely_ on fish, for of this I have my doubts; certainly  those I have had did not appear to thrive if they had fish too often.    Again, as the Cats are to roam the island at their \"own sweet will,\" I  take it there will be at times some \"damaging of fur\" by the playful way  in which they so often engage, when jealousy incites them to mortal  combat. But possibly this has been considered and duly entered in the  \"profit and loss\" account.

Laws of marriage and procreation          PREFACE.      The present is an age of progress, of change, of rapid advance, and of  wonderful revolutions.    The very foundations of society--social, political, commercial, moral  and religious, seem to be shaken as with a mighty earthquake, from  centre to circumference. All things tremble; creation groans; the  world is in travail, and pains to be delivered.    A new era has dawned upon our planet, and is advancing with  accelerated force--with giant strides.    The rail-roads and the steam-boats, with their progressive  improvements in speed, safety and convenience, are extending and  multiplying the means of travel, of trade, of association, and  intercommunication between countries whose inhabitants have been  comparatively unknown to, or estranged from, each other.    But, as if even these means were too slow for the God-like  aspirations, the mighty throes of human thought, and its struggles for  light and expansion, man seizes the lightning, tames and subdues it,  and makes it the bearer of his thoughts and despatches. While these  things are in progress by one portion of mankind, another learns to  seize and control a sunbeam, in a manner subservient to the progress  of the fine arts: and by which means a man performs in a minute, the  work which a short time since would have employed the most active  years of a lifetime.    While every science, every art is being developed; while the mind is  awakened to new thought; while the windows of heaven are opened, as it  were, and the profound depths of human intellect are stirred--moved  from the foundation on all other subjects, religious knowledge seems  at a stand still.    The _creeds_ of the Fathers seem to have been cast in the mould of  other ages, to be adapted to a more narrow sphere of intellectual  development, and to be composed of material too much resembling cast  iron; or, at least, not sufficiently elastic to expand with the  expansion of mind, to grow with the growth, and advance with the  progressive principles of the age.    For these reasons, perhaps more than any other, the master spirits of  the age are breaking loose from the old moorings, and withdrawing from  established and venerated systems, by which means society is  distracted, divided, broken up, thrown, as it were, into a chaos of  confused, disorganized individualization, without a standard or  rallying point, without a nucleus by which to concentrate or  re-organise this chaotic mass, these atoms of thought.    One thing is certain--according to ancient prophecy, and agreeable to  the general expectation of this and other ages, the day approaches  which will flood the earth with the pure principles of religious  knowledge; a day when none will have to teach his neighbour, saying,  Know ye the Lord; for all persons shall know Him, from the least to  the greatest.    It should be a matter of serious thought and investigation--without  respect to party, sect, or creed, whether there should not, in the  very nature of present circumstances, and future Millennial hopes, be  an entire remodelling, or re-organization of religious society, upon  the broad basis of revealed knowledge, tangible fact, and  philosophical, scientific and spiritual Truth--a universal  \"_standard_,\" of immutable Truth, instead of numberless systems  founded on uncertainty, opinion, mere human impression, or conjecture.    Can anything short of such a standard unite society, enlighten the  world, establish real peace, brotherhood and fellowship, and put a  final end to all religious ignorance, superstition, jargon, or  discord? Is not a difference of opinion, or a disagreement on any  given subject, a proof positive of existing ignorance, or want of  light or information, on the part of the parties disagreeing? If so,  the present age is certainly in the dark, or, in a great measure,  ignorant on religious subjects. A knowledge of the Truth can alone  bring the desired union, and bid discord cease. If the Scriptures be  true, it is not religious _opinion_ which will cover the earth, and  universally pervade every bosom, but it is, a KNOWLEDGE, \"The  knowledge of God.\" \"_God is Truth_.\" To _know_ Him, is to know the  Truth.    The present Volume aims to embody, in a concise and somewhat original  manner and style, a general view of the Science of Theology, as  gathered from revelation, history, prophecy, reason and analogy.    If the Work proves an introductory key to some of the first principles  of the divine science of which it treats; if it serves to open the  eyes of any of his fellowmen, on the facts of the past, the present,  and the future; if it leads to investigation and inquiry, and calls  public attention to the greater and more particular truths which have  been, or are about to be, revealed as a standard by which to unite the  people of all nations and of all religions upon the rock, the sure  foundation of divine, eternal, uncreated, infinite and exhaustless  Truth, it will have accomplished the end aimed at by                                                  THE AUTHOR.          Key to Theology.      CHAPTER I.    THEOLOGY--ITS DEFINITION--HISTORICAL ILLUSTRATIONS.         Eternal Science! who would fathom thee     Must launch his bark upon a shoreless sea.     Thy knowledge yet shall overwhelm the earth,     Thy truth to immortality to give birth;     Thy dawn shall kindle to eternal day,     And man, immortal, still shall own thy sway.    First. THEOLOGY is the science of communication, or of correspondence,  between God, angels, spirits, and men, by means of visions, dreams,  interpretations, conversations, inspirations, or the spirit of  prophecy and revelation.    Second. It is the science by which worlds are organized, sustained,  and directed, and the elements controlled.    Third. It is the science of knowledge, and the key and power thereof,  by which the heavens are opened, and lawful access is obtained to the  treasures of wisdom and intelligence--inexhaustible, infinite,  embracing the past, the present, and the future.    Fourth. It is the science of life--endless and eternal, by which the  living are changed or translated, and the dead raised.    Fifth. It is the science of _faith_, reformation, and remission of  sins, whereby a fallen race of mortals may be justified, cleansed, and  restored to the communion and fellowship of that Holy Spirit which is  the light of the world, and of every intelligence therein.    Sixth. It is the science of spiritual gifts, by which the blind see,  the deaf hear, the lame walk, the sick are healed, and demons are  expelled from the human system.    Seventh. It is the science of all other sciences and useful arts,  being in fact the very fountain from which they emanate. It includes  philosophy, astronomy, history, mathematics, "]]]
