THE    INFERNO        A TRANSLATION    WITH NOTES AND AN INTRODUCTORY ESSAY BY    JAMES ROMANES SIBBALD        EDINBURGH    PUBLISHED BY DAVID DOUGLAS    MDCCCLXXXIV          PREFACE.      A Translator who has never felt his self-imposed task to be a light one  may be excused from entering into explanations that would but too  naturally take the form of apologies. I will only say that while I have  striven to be as faithful as I could to the words as well as to the  sense of my author, the following translation is not offered as being  always closely literal. The kind of verse employed I believe to be that  best fitted to give some idea, however faint, of the rigidly measured  and yet easy strength of Dante's _terza rima_; but whoever chooses to  adopt it with its constantly recurring demand for rhymes necessarily  becomes in some degree its servant. Such students as wish to follow the  poet word by word will always find what they need in Dr. J. A. Carlyle's  excellent prose version of the _Inferno_, a work to which I have to  acknowledge my own indebtedness at many points.    The matter of the notes, it is needless to say, has been in very great  part found ready to my hand in existing Commentaries. My edition of John  Villani is that of Florence, 1823.    The Note at page cx was printed before it had been resolved to provide  the volume with a copy of Giotto's portrait of Dante. I have to thank  the Council of the Arundel Society for their kind permission to Messrs.  Dawson to make use of their lithograph of Mr. Seymour Kirkup's  invaluable sketch in the production of the Frontispiece--a privilege  that would have been taken more advantage of had it not been deemed  advisable to work chiefly from the photograph of the same sketch, given  in the third volume of the late Lord Vernon's sumptuous and rare edition  of the _Inferno_ (Florence, 1865). In this Vernon photograph, as well as  in the Arundel Society's chromolithograph, the disfiguring mark on the  face caused by the damage to the plaster of the fresco is faithfully  reproduced. A less degree of fidelity has been observed in the  Frontispiece; although the restoration has not been carried the length  of replacing the lost eye.    EDINBURGH, _February_, 1884.

DICK                             ILLUSTRATED BY SMITH    [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Science Fiction  Adventures Magazine December 1953.

Then one day he saw _it_ hanging in the town      square.      Five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car  out and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His  back and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and  wheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done  okay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he  liked the idea of repairing the foundations himself!    It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying  commuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and  packages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks  and businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red  light and then started it up again. The store had been open without him;  he'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the  records of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove  slowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the  town park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND  SERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again  he passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain  and bench and single lamppost.    From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle,  swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled  down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of  some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the  square.    Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park  and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a  display it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he  swallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.    It was a body. A human body.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\"    Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe  coat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy  standing there.\"    \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up  against the sky--the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.  How the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's  wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"    Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must  be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"    \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"    Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that  wrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"    Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"    \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to  call the cops.\"    \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be  there.\"    \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business  before pleasure.\"    Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A  man's body! A dead man!\"    \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"    \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"    \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.  See you later, Ed.\"    Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the  sidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously  at the dark bundle--and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any  attention.    \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and  crossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.  He gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.    The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray  suit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never  seen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and  in the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin  was gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A  pair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His  eyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.    \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea  and made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with  revulsion--and fear.    _Why?_ Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?    And--why didn't anybody notice?    He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the  man grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"    Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"    \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look  sick.\"    \"The body. There in the park.\"    \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND  SERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"    Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something  wrong?\"    \"Ed's not feeling well.\"    Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?  For God's sake--\"    \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.    \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"    More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"    \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at  him. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"    \"Ed--\"    \"Better get a doctor!\"    \"He must be sick.\"    \"Or drunk.\"    Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.  Through a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men  and women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them  toward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,  showing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service  counter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.  His voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.    \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!  Something's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"    The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving  efficiently toward Loyce.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Name?\" the cop with the notebook murmured.    \"Loyce.\" He mopped his forehead wearily. \"Edward C. Loyce. Listen to me.  Back there--\"    \"Address?\" the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through  traffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the  seat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath.    \"1368 Hurst Road.\"    \"That's here in Pikeville?\"    \"That's right.\" Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. \"Listen  to me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppost--\"    \"Where were you today?\" the cop behind the wheel demanded.    \"Where?\" Loyce echoed.    \"You weren't in your shop, were you?\"    \"No.\" He shook his head. \"No, I was home. Down in the basement.\"    \"In the _basement_?\"    \"Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame.  Why? What has that to do with--\"    \"Was anybody else down there with you?\"    \"No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school.\" Loyce looked from  one heavy-set cop to the other. Hope flicked across his face, wild hope.  \"You mean because I was down there I missed--the explanation? I didn't  get in on it? Like everybody else?\"    After a pause the cop with the notebook said: \"That's right. You missed  the explanation.\"    \"Then it's official? The body--it's _supposed_ to be hanging there?\"    \"It's supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see.\"    Ed Loyce grinned weakly. \"Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep  end. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like  the Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking  over.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands  shaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\"    \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of  Justice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights  had not yet come on.    \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.  I guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to  take me in, is there?\"    The two cops said nothing.    \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all  right, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of--\"    \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short  process. Only a few minutes.\"    \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a  stoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting  excited like that and--\"    Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled  to his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light  changed. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,  burrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,  people running.    They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in  Pikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small  town for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.    They weren't cops--and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,  Fergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't  know--and they didn't care. _That_ was the strange part.    Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the"]]]
