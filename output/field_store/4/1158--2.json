ADLARD,                             BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE.          INTRODUCTION.      As this little book is intended to be no more than an introduction to an  agreeable branch of microscopical study, it is to be hoped it will not  require a formal preface; but a few words may be convenient to indicate  its scope and purpose.    The common experience of all microscopists confirms the assertion made  by Dr. Goring, that the most fascinating objects are living creatures of  sufficient dimensions to be easily understood with moderate  magnification; and in no way can objects of this description be so  readily obtained, as by devoting an occasional hour to the examination  of the little ponds which are accessible from almost any situation. A  complete volume of pond lore would not only be a bulky book--much bigger  than the aldermanic tomes which it is the fashion to call \"Manuals,\"  although the great stone fists in the British Museum would be required  to grasp them comfortably,--but its composition would overtask all the  philosophers of our day. In good truth, a tea-spoonful of water from a  prolific locality often contains a variety of living forms, every one of  which demands a profound and patient study, if we would know but a few  things concerning it.    To man, then, is a vast and a minute. Our minds ache at the  contemplation of astronomical immensities, and we are apt to see the  boundless only in prodigious masses, countless numbers, and  immeasurable spaces. The Creative Mind knows no such limitations; and  the microscope shows us that, whether the field of nature's operation be  what to our apprehension is great or small, there is no limit to the  exhibition of marvellous skill. If the \"undevout astronomer\" be \"mad,\"  the undevout microscopist must be still more so, for if the matter be  judged by human sense, the skill is greater as the operation is more  minute; and not the sun itself, nor the central orb round which he  revolves, with all his attendant worlds, can furnish sublimer objects of  contemplation, than the miraculous assemblage of forces which make up  the life of the smallest creature that the microscope reveals.    There is an irresistible charm in the effort to trace _beginnings_ in  nature. We know that we can never succeed; that each discovery, which  conducts back towards some elementary law or principle, only indicates  how much still lies behind it: but the geologist nevertheless loves to  search out the first or oldest traces of life upon our globe; and so the  microscopist delights to view the simplest exhibitions of structures and  faculties, which reach their completion in the frame and mind of man.  That one great plan runs through the whole universe is now an  universally accepted truth, and when applied to physiology and natural  history, it leads to most important results.    The researches of recent philosophers have shown us that nature cannot  be understood by studying the parts of animals with reference merely to  their utility in the economy of the creature to which they belong. We  do, indeed, find an admirable correspondence between structures and the  services they perform; but every object in creation, and every part of  it, is in harmonious relation to some grand design, and exhibits a  conformity to some general mode of operation, or some general  disposition and direction of forces, which secures the existence of the  individual or the species, and at the same time works out the most  majestic schemes. Microscopic researches, such as are within the reach  of millions, offer many of the most beautiful illustrations of these  truths; and although the following pages are confined to such objects as  are easily obtainable from ponds, and relate almost exclusively to the  Infusoria, the Rotifers, the Polyps, and the Polyzoa, it is hoped that  they will assist in associating a few of the highly suggestive  reasonings of science, with one of the most pleasurable recreations that  human ingenuity has devised.    After a preliminary chapter, which is intended to assist the young  microscopist in some technical matters, that could not be conveniently  introduced into the text, the observations are distributed in chapters,  corresponding with the twelve calendar months. This arrangement was  suggested by the author's diary of operations for the year 1860, and  although it by no means follows that the months in which particular  creatures were then discovered, will be those in which they will be most  readily found in other years, it was thought advantageous to give a real  account of an actual period of microscopic work, and also that the plan  would facilitate a departure from the dry manner of a technical  treatise. The index will enable any one to use the book for the purpose  of reference, and it will be observed that the first chapter in which  any member of a group of creatures is introduced, is that in which a  general description of the class is given. The illustrations are taken  from drawings made by the wife of the author from the actual objects,  with the exception of a few instances, in which the authority is  acknowledged. The sketches were made _especially for beginners_, and the  rule followed, was not to introduce any details that could not be seen  at one focus, and with the simplest means: more elaborate  representations, though of the highest value to advanced students, are  bewildering at the commencement.    The ponds referred to are all either close to, or within a moderate  distance of, London;[1] but similar objects will in all probability be  obtained from any ponds similarly situated, and the descriptions and  directions given for the capture of the minute prey will be found  generally applicable. Care has been taken throughout to explain the most  convenient methods of examining the objects, and although verbal  descriptions are poor substitutes for the teachings of experience, it is  hoped that those here given will remove some difficulties from a pursuit  that no intelligent person can enter upon without pleasure, or consent  to abandon when its elementary difficulties have been mastered, and the  boundless fields of discovery are opened to view. Let not the novice be  startled at the word \"discovery.\" It is true that few are likely to  arrive at new principles or facts which will inscribe their names upon  the roll of fame; but no one of ordinary powers can look at living  objects with any considerable perseverance, without seeing much that has  never been recorded, and which is nevertheless worthy of note; and when  the mind, by its own exertions, first arrives at a knowledge of new  truth, an emotion is felt akin to that which more than recompenses the  profoundest philosopher for all his toil.

                136          ADELIE PENGUINS(1)      INTRODUCTION    The penguins of the Antarctic regions very rightly have been termed the  true inhabitants of that country. The species is of great antiquity,  fossil remains of their ancestors having been found, which showed that  they flourished as far back as the eocene epoch. To a degree far in  advance of any other bird, the penguin has adapted itself to the sea as  a means of livelihood, so that it rivals the very fishes. This  proficiency in the water has been gained at the expense of its power of  flight, but this is a matter of small moment, as it happens.      (1) _Pygoscelis adeliae._    In few other regions could such an animal as the penguin rear its young,  for when on land its short legs offer small advantage as a means of  getting about, and as it cannot fly, it would become an easy prey to any  of the carnivora which abound in other parts of the globe. Here,  however, there are none of the bears and foxes which inhabit the North  Polar regions, and once ashore the penguin is safe.    The reason for this state of things is that there is no food of any  description to be had inland. Ages back, a different state of things  existed: tropical forests abounded, and at one time, the seals ran about  on shore like dogs. As conditions changed, these latter had to take to  the sea for food, with the result that their four legs, in course of  time, gave place to wide paddles or \"flippers,\" as the penguins' wings  have done, so that at length they became true inhabitants of the sea.    Were the Sea-Leopards(2) (the Adelies' worst enemy) to take to the land  again, there would be a speedy end to all the southern penguin  rookeries. As these, however, are inhabited only during four and a half  months of the year, the advantage to the seals in growing legs again  would not be great enough to influence evolution in that direction. At  the same time, I wonder very much that the sea-leopards, who can squirm  along at a fair pace on land, have not crawled up the few yards of  ice-foot intervening between the water and some of the rookeries, as,  even if they could not catch the old birds, they would reap a rich  harvest among the chicks when these are hatched.
