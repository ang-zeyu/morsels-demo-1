Biologically, anger and hatred follow fear and injury, and  punishment follows these in turn. Individuals, communities and whole  peoples hate and swear vengeance for an injury, real or fancied.  Punishments, even to the extent of death, are inflicted where there can  be no possible object except revenge. Whether the victim is weak or  strong, old or young, sane or insane, makes no difference; men and  societies react to injury exactly as animals react.    That vengeance is the moving purpose of punishment is abundantly shown  by the religious teachings that shape the ethical ideas of the Western  world. The Old Testament abounds in the justification of vengeance. A  few quotations amply show the Biblical approval of this doctrine:        Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.      Genesis 9;6.        No expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed      therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. Numbers 35;33.        Wherefore should the nations [Gentiles] say, Where is their [the      Jews'] God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is      shed, be known among the nations in our sight. Psalms 79;10.        The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall      wash his feet in the blood of the wicked; so that men shall say,      Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily there is a God      that judgeth in the earth. Psalms 58;10.        And I [God] will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the      nations which hearkened not. Micah 5;15.        All things are cleansed with blood, and apart from the shedding of      blood there is no remission. Hebrews 9;22.        For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me. ... It is a      fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Hebrews      10;30.    True it is often claimed that Jesus repudiated the doctrine of  vengeance. The passage of 5th Matthew, 38-30 is often quoted in proof of  this assertion--\"Ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an  eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I say unto you, that ye resist not  evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the  other also.\" But the gospels and the other books of the New Testament  show plainly that non-resistance was not laid down as a rule for the  guidance of mankind, but only as a policy by one sect of the Jews and  Christians to save themselves from the Romans. The reason for the  doctrine was the belief that resistance was hopeless, and that God who  had the power would in his own time visit on the oppressors the  vengeance that the Jews and Christians were too weak to inflict. Jesus  and the early Christians knew of no people beyond their immediate  territory, and they did not appeal to mankind as a whole, or to future  generations.    The early Christians believed in judging and in punishment as vengeance,  the same as the Jews and other peoples believed in it. (See 13 Matthew  41-43, 23 Matthew 33, 25 Matthew 46.) They believed that the end of the  world was at hand; that the coming of the Lord was imminent; that some  of that generation would not taste death, and that God would punish  sinners in his own time. The New Testament is replete with this  doctrine, which was stated and elaborated in the so-called \"Revelations  of St. Peter.\"    Probably this document was composed about the year 150 A.D. and by the  year 200 it was read as \"Scripture\" in some Christian communities.  Subsequently it disappeared and was known only by name until a  substantial fragment of the document was discovered at Akhmim in Egypt,  in the year 1887. A portion of it represents a scene in which the  disciples of Jesus ask him to show them the state of the righteous dead,  in order that this knowledge may be used to encourage people to accept  Christianity. The request is granted and the disciples are shown not  only a vision of the delightful abodes of the righteous, but also a  vivid picture of the punishments that are being meted out to the wicked.  It is interesting to note how the punishments are devised to balance in  truly retributive fashion the crimes mentioned. It is this type of  tradition that furnished Dante and Milton the basis for their pictures  of hell.    The following is the more interesting portion of this document:        And the Lord showed me [Peter] a very great country outside of this      world, exceeding bright with light, and the air there lighted with      rays of the sun, and the earth itself blooming with unfading flowers      and full of spices and plants, fair-flowering and incorruptible and      bearing blessed fruit. And so great was the perfume that it was      borne thence even unto us. And the dwellers in that place were clad      in the raiment of shining angels and their raiment was like unto      their country; and angels hovered about them there. And the glory of      the dwellers there was equal, and with one voice they sang praises      alternately to the Lord God, rejoicing in that place. The Lord said      to us, This is the place of your brethren the righteous.        And over against that place I saw another, exceedingly parched, and      it was the place of punishment. And those who were being punished      there and the angels who punished them wore dark raiment like the      air of the place.        Certain persons there were hanging by the tongue. These were they      who blaspheme the way of righteousness, and under them lay a fire      whose flames tortured them.        Also there was a great lake full of flaming mire in which were      certain men that pervert righteousness, and tormenting angels      afflicted them.        And there were also others, women, hanged by their hair over that      mire that flamed up, and these were they who adorned themselves for      adultery. And the men who mingled with them in the defilement of      adultery, were hanging by the feet with their heads in that mire,      and they exclaimed in a loud voice: We did not believe that we      should come to this place.        And I saw the murderers and their accomplices cast into a certain      narrow place full of evil snakes where these evil beasts smote them      while they turned to and fro in that punishment, and worms like      great black clouds afflicted them. And the souls of those who had      been murdered said, as they stood and looked upon the punishment of      their murderers, O God, just is thy judgment.        And other men and women were aflame up to the middle, and were cast      into a dark place and were beaten by evil spirits, and their inwards      were eaten by restless worms. These were they who persecuted the      righteous and delivered them up to the authorities.        And over against these were other men and women gnawing their      tongues and having flaming fire in their mouths. These were false      witnesses.        And in a certain other place there were pebbles sharper than swords      or any needle, red hot, and women and men in tattered and filthy      raiment, rolled about on them in punishment. These were the rich who      trusted in their riches and had no pity for orphans and widows and      despised the commandment of God.        And in another great lake full of boiling pitch and blood and mire      stood men and women up to their knees. These were the usurers and      those who take compound interest.    The noted preacher, scholar and president of Princeton College, Jonathan  Edwards, in his famous sermon, \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,\"  put in forcible and picturesque language the religious and legal view of  punishment as vengeance:        They [sinners] deserve to be cast into hell; so that divine justice      never stands in the way, it makes no objection against God's using      His power at any moment to destroy them. Yea, on the contrary,      justice calls aloud for an infinite punishment on their sins. Divine      justice says of the tree that brings forth such grapes of Sodom,      \"Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?\" Luke xiii. 7. The sword      of divine justice is every moment brandished over their heads, and      it is nothing but the hand of arbitrary mercy, and God's mere will,      that holds it back.        They are now the objects of that very same anger and wrath of God,      that is expressed in the torments of hell: and the reason why they      do not go down to hell at each moment, is not because God, in whose      power they are, is not then very angry with them; as angry as He is      with many of those miserable creatures that He is now tormenting in      hell, and do there feel and bear the fierceness of His wrath. Yea,      God is a great deal more angry with great numbers that are now on      earth; yea, doubtless, with many that are now in this congregation,      that, it may be, are at ease and quiet, than He is with many of      those that are now in the flames of hell.        So that it is not because God is unmindful of their wickedness and      does not resent it, that He does not let loose His hand and cut them      off. God is not altogether such a one as themselves, though they      imagine Him to be so. The wrath of God burns against them; their      damnation does not slumber; the pit is prepared; the fire is made      ready; the furnace is now hot; ready to receive them; the flames      rage and glow. The glittering sword is whet and held over them, and      the pit hath opened her mouth under them.        The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a      spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is      dreadfully provoked; His wrath towards you burns like fire; He looks      upon you as worthy of nothing else, but to be cast into the fire; He      is of purer eyes than to bear to have you in His sight; you are ten      thousand times more abominable in His eyes than the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12058"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#3)"],[1,"to undertake it, is alone  fit to reside in a royal household. He that living away from his home,  doth no remember his dear ones, and who undergoeth (present) misery in  expectation of (future) happiness, is alone worthy of dwelling in a  royal household. One should not dress like the king, nor should one  indulge in laughter in the king's presence nor should one disclose royal  secrets. By acting thus one may win royal favour. Commissioned to a  task, one should not touch bribes for by such appropriation one becometh  liable to fetters or death. The robes, ornaments, cars, and other things  which the king may be pleased to bestow should always be used, for by  this, one winneth the royal favour. Ye children, controlling your minds,  do ye spend this year, ye sons of Pandu, behaving in this way. Regaining  your own kingdom, ye may live as ye please.'        [6] Some of the Bengal text and _Sarvatramaya_ for      _Sarvamantramaya_. The former is evidently incorrect.        [7] This is a very difficult _sloka_. Nilakantha adopts the      reading _Sanjayet_. The Bengal editions read _Sanjapet_. If the      latter be the correct reading, the meaning then would be,--'Let      none talk about what transpires in the presence of the king. For      those even that are poor, regard it as a grave fault.' The sense      evidently is that the occurrences in respect of a king which one      witnesses should not be divulged. Even they that are powerless      regard such divulgence of what occurs in respect of them as an      insult to them, and, therefore, inexcusable.        [8] The Bengal editions read _Rajna_ in the instrumental case.      Following a manuscript text of a Pandit of my acquaintance I      read _Rajnas_ in the genitive.    \"Yudhishthira said, 'We have been well taught by thee. Blessed be thou.  There is none that could say so to us, save our mother Kunti and Vidura  of great wisdom. It behoveth thee to do all that is necessary now for  our departure, and for enabling us to come safely through this woe, as  well as for our victory over the foe.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed by Yudhishthira, Dhaumya, that  best of Brahmanas, performed according to the ordinance the rites  ordained in respect of departure. And lighting up their fires, he  offered, with _mantras_, oblations on them for the prosperity and  success of the Pandavas, as for their reconquest of the whole world. And  walking round those fires and round the Brahmanas of ascetic wealth, the  six set out, placing Yajnaseni in their front. And when those heroes had  departed, Dhaumya, that best of ascetics, taking their sacred fires, set  out for the Panchalas. And Indrasena, and others already mentioned, went  to the Yadavas, and looking after the horses and the cars of the  Pandavas passed their time happily and in privacy.\"      SECTION V    Vaisampayana said, \"Girding their waists with swords, and equipped with  finger-protectors made of iguana skins and with various weapons, those  heroes proceeded in the direction of the river Yamuna. And those bowmen  desirous of (speedily) recovering their kingdom, hitherto living in  inaccessible hills and forest fastnesses, now terminated their  forest-life and proceeded to the southern bank of that river. And those  mighty warriors endued with great strength and hitherto leading the  lives of hunters by killing the deer of the forest, passed through  _Yakrilloma_ and Surasena, leaving behind, on their right, the country  of the Panchalas, and on their left, that of the Dasarnas. And those  bowmen, looking wan and wearing beards and equipped with swords, entered  Matsya's dominions leaving the forest, giving themselves out as hunters.  And on arriving at that country, Krishna addressed Yudhishthira, saying,  'We see footpaths here, and various fields. From this it appears that  Virata's metropolis is still at a distance. Pass we here what part of  the night is still left, for great is my fatigue.'    \"Yudhishthira answered, 'O Dhananjaya of Bharata's race, do thou take up  Panchali and carry her. Just on emerging from this forest, we arrive at  the city.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Thereupon like the leader of a herd of  elephants, Arjuna speedily took up Draupadi, and on coming to the  vicinity of the city, let her down. And on reaching the city, Ruru's son  (Yudhishthira), addressed Arjuna, saying, 'Where shall we deposit our  weapons, before entering the city? If, O child, we enter it with our  weapons about us, we shall thereby surely excite the alarm of the  citizens. Further, the tremendous bow, the _Gandiva_, is known to all  men, so that people will, without doubt, recognise us soon. And if even  one of us is discovered, we shall, according to promise, have to pass  another twelve years in the forest.'    \"Arjuna said, 'Hard by yon cemetery and near that inaccessible peak is a  mighty _Sami_ tree, throwing-about its gigantic branches and difficult  to ascend. Nor is there any human being, who, I think, O Pandu's son,  will espy us depositing our arms at that place. That tree is in the  midst of an out-of-the way forest abounding in beasts and snakes, and is  in the vicinity of a dreary cemetery. Stowing away our weapons on the  _Sami_ tree, let us, O Bharata, go to the city, and live there, free  from anxiety!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having O bull of the Bharata race spoken thus  to king Yudhishthira the just, Arjuna prepared to deposit the weapons  (on the tree). And that bull among the Kurus, then loosened the string  of the large and dreadful _Gandiva_, ever producing thundering twang and  always destructive of hostile hosts, and with which he had conquered, on  a single car, gods and men and _Nagas_ and swelling provinces. And the  warlike Yudhishthira, that represser of foes, unfastened the undecaying  string of that bow with which he had defended the field of Kurukshetra.  And the illustrious Bhimasena unstrung that bow by means of which that  sinless one had vanquished in fight the Panchalas and the lord of  Sindhu, and with which, during his career of conquest, he had,  single-handed, opposed innumerable foes, and hearing whose twang which  was like unto the roar of the thunder or the splitting of a mountain,  enemies always fly (in panic) from the field of battle. And that son of  Pandu of coppery complexion and mild speech who is endued with great  prowess in the field, and is called Nakula in consequence of his  unexampled beauty in the family, then unfastened the string of that bow  with which he had conquered all the regions of the west. And the heroic  Sahadeva also, possessed of a mild disposition, then untied the string  of that bow with which he had subjugated the countries of the south. And  with their bows, they put together their long and flashing swords, their  precious quivers, and their arrows sharp as razors. And Nakula ascended  the tree, and deposited on it the bows and the other weapons. And he  tied them fast on those parts of the tree which he thought would not  break, and where the rain would not penetrate. And the Pandavas hung up  a corpse (on the tree), knowing that people smelling the stench of the  corpse would say--_here sure, is a dead body_, and avoid the tree from a  distance. And on being asked by the shepherds and cowherds regarding the  corpse, those repressers of foes said unto them, 'This is our mother,  aged one hundred and eighty years. We have hung up her dead body, in  accordance with the custom observed by our forefathers.' And then those  resisters of foes approached the city. And for purposes of non-discovery  Yudhishthira kept these (five) names for himself and his brothers  respectively, viz., Jaya, Jayanta, Vijaya, Jayatsena, and Jayadvala.  Then they entered the great city, with the view to passing the  thirteenth year undiscovered in that kingdom, agreeably to the promise  (to Duryodhana).\"      SECTION VI    Vaisampayana said, \"And while Yudhishthira was on his way to the  delightful city of Virata, he began to praise mentally the Divine Durga,  the Supreme Goddess of the Universe, born on the womb of Yasoda, and  fond of the boons bestowed on her by Narayana, sprung from the race of  cowherd Nanda, and the giver of prosperity, the enhancer (of the glory)  of (the worshipper's) family, the terrifier of Kansa, and the destroyer  of _Asuras_,--and saluted the Goddess--her who ascended the skies when  dashed (by Kansa) on a stony platform, who is the sister of Vasudeva,  one who is always decked in celestial garlands and attired in celestial  robes,--who is armed with scimitar and shield, and always rescues the  worshipper sunk in sin, like a cow in the mire, who in the hours of  distress calls upon that eternal giver of blessings for relieving him of  their burdens. And the king, desirous with his brothers of obtaining a  sight of the Goddess, invoked her and began to praise her by reciting  various names derived from (approved) hymns. And Yudhishthira said,  'Salutations to thee, O giver of boons. O thou that art identical with  Krishna, O maiden, O thou that hast observed the vow of _Brahmacharya_,  O thou of body bright as the newly-risen Sun, O thou of face beautiful  as the full moon. Salutations to thee, O thou of four hands and four  faces, O thou of fair round hips and deep bosom, O thou that wearest  bangles made of emeralds and sapphires, O thou that bearest excellent  bracelets on thy upper arm. Thou shinest, O Goddess, as Padma, the  consort of Narayana. O thou that rangest the etherial regions, thy true  form and thy _Brahmacharya_ are both of the purest kind. Sable as the  black clouds, thy face is beautiful as that of _Sankarshana_. Thou  bearest two large arms long as a couple of poles raised in honour of  Indra. In thy (six) other arms thou bearest a vessel, a lotus, a bell, a  noose, a bow, a large discus, and various other weapons. Thou art the  only female in the universe that possessest the"]]]
