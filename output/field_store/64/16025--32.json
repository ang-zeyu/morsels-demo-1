He was a  second time thrown into prison, on a charge of heresy and sorcery; and  he then resolved, if ever he obtained his liberty, to return to England.  He soon discovered that there was no prospect of this, and that his  imprisonment was likely to be for life. He twisted his bed-clothes into  a rope, one stormy night in February 1595, and let himself down from the  window of his dungeon, situated at the top of a very high tower. Being a  corpulent man, the rope gave way, and he was precipitated to the ground.  He broke two of his ribs, and both his legs; and was otherwise so much  injured, that he expired a few days afterwards.    Dee, for a while, had more prosperous fortune. The warming-pan he had  sent to Queen Elizabeth was not without effect. He was rewarded, soon  after Kelly had left him, with an invitation to return to England. His  pride, which had been sorely humbled, sprang up again to its pristine  dimensions; and he set out for Bohemia with a train of attendants  becoming an ambassador. How he procured the money does not appear,  unless from the liberality of the rich Bohemian Rosenberg, or perhaps  from his plunder. He travelled with three coaches for himself and  family, and three waggons to carry his baggage. Each coach had four  horses, and the whole train was protected by a guard of four and twenty  soldiers. This statement may be doubted; but it is on the authority of  Dee himself, who made it on oath before the commissioners appointed by  Elizabeth to inquire into his circumstances. On his arrival in England  he had an audience of the Queen, who received him kindly as far as words  went, and gave orders that he should not be molested in his pursuits of  chemistry and philosophy. A man who boasted of the power to turn baser  metals into gold, could not, thought Elizabeth, be in want of money; and  she, therefore, gave him no more substantial marks of her approbation  than her countenance and protection.    Thrown thus unexpectedly upon his own resources, Dee began in earnest  the search for the philosopher's stone. He worked incessantly among  his furnaces, retorts, and crucibles, and almost poisoned himself with  deleterious fumes. He also consulted his miraculous crystal; but the  spirits appeared not to him. He tried one Bartholomew to supply the  place of the invaluable Kelly; but he being a man of some little  probity, and of no imagination at all, the spirits would not hold any  communication with him. Dee then tried another pretender to philosophy,  of the name of Hickman; but had no better fortune. The crystal had  lost its power since the departure of its great high-priest. From this  quarter then Dee could get no information on the stone or elixir of the  alchymists, and all his efforts to discover them by other means were not  only fruitless but expensive. He was soon reduced to great distress, and  wrote piteous letters to the Queen, praying relief. He represented that,  after he left England with Count Laski, the mob had pillaged his house  at Mortlake, accusing him of being a necromancer and a wizard; and  had broken all his furniture, burned his library, consisting of four  thousand rare volumes, and destroyed all the philosophical instruments  and curiosities in his museum. For this damage he claimed compensation;  and furthermore stated, that, as he had come to England by the Queen's  command, she ought to pay the expenses of his journey. Elizabeth sent  him small sums of money at various times; but, Dee still continuing  his complaints, a commission was appointed to inquire into his  circumstances. He finally obtained a small appointment as Chancellor of  St. Paul's cathedral, which he exchanged, in 1595, for the wardenship  of the college at Manchester. He remained in this capacity till 1602  or 1603, when, his strength and intellect beginning to fail him, he was  compelled to resign. He retired to his old dwelling at Mortlake, in a  state not far removed from actual want, supporting himself as a common  fortune-teller, and being often obliged to sell or pawn his books to  procure a dinner. James I. was often applied to on his behalf, but he  refused to do anything for him. It may be said to the discredit of this  King, that the only reward he would grant the indefatigable Stowe, in  his days of old age and want, was the royal permission to beg; but no  one will blame him for neglecting such a quack as John Dee. He died in  1608, in the eighty-first year of his age, and was buried at Mortlake.    THE COSMOPOLITE.    Many disputes have arisen as to the real name of the alchymist who wrote  several works under the above designation. The general opinion is  that he was a Scotsman, named Seton; and that by a fate very common to  alchymists, who boasted too loudly of their powers of transmutation,  he ended his days miserably in a dungeon, into which he was thrown by a  German potentate until he made a million of gold to pay his ransom. By  some he has been confounded with Michael Sendivog, or Sendivogius, a  Pole, a professor of the same art, who made a great noise in Europe at  the commencement of the seventeenth century. Lenglet du Fresnoy, who is  in general well-informed with respect to the alchymists, inclines to  the belief that these personages were distinct; and gives the following  particulars of the Cosmopolite, extracted from George Morhoff, in his  \"Epistola ad Langelottum,\" and other writers.    About the year 1600, one Jacob Haussen, a Dutch pilot, was shipwrecked  on the coast of Scotland. A gentleman, named Alexander Seton, put off  in a boat, and saved him from drowning, and afterwards entertained him  hospitably for many weeks at his house on the shore. Haussen saw that  he was addicted to the pursuits of chemistry, but no conversation on  the subject passed between them at the time. About a year and a half  afterwards, Haussen being then at home at Enkhuysen, in Holland,  received a visit from his former host. He endeavoured to repay the  kindness that had been shown him; and so great a friendship arose  between them, that Seton, on his departure, offered to make him  acquainted with the great secret of the philosopher's stone. In his  presence the Scotsman transmuted a great quantity of base metal into  pure gold, and gave it him as a mark of his esteem. Seton then took  leave of his friend, and travelled into Germany. At Dresden he made  no secret of his wonderful powers; having, it is said, performed  transmutation successfully before a great assemblage of the learned men  of that city. The circumstance coming to the ears of the Duke or Elector  of Saxony, he gave orders for the arrest of the alchymist. He caused him  to be imprisoned in a high tower, and set a guard of forty men to watch  that he did not escape, and that no strangers were admitted to his  presence. The unfortunate Seton received several visits from the  Elector, who used every art of persuasion to make him divulge his  secret. Seton obstinately refused either to communicate his secret,  or to make any gold for the tyrant; on which he was stretched upon the  rack, to see if the argument of torture would render him more tractable.  The result was still the same,--neither hope of reward nor fear of  anguish could shake him. For several months he remained in prison,  subjected alternately to a sedative and a violent regimen, till his  health broke, and he wasted away almost to a skeleton.    There happened at that time to be in Dresden a learned Pole, named  Michael Sendivogius, who had wasted a good deal of his time and  substance in the unprofitable pursuits of alchymy. He was touched with  pity for the hard fate, and admiration for the intrepidity of Seton; and  determined, if possible, to aid him in escaping from the clutch of his  oppressor. He requested the Elector's permission to see the alchymist,  and obtained it with some difficulty. He found him in a state of great  wretchedness,--shut up from the light of day in a noisome dungeon,  and with no better couch or fare than those allotted to the worst  of criminals. Seton listened eagerly to the proposal of escape, and  promised the generous Pole that he would make him richer than an Eastern  monarch if by his means he were liberated. Sendivogius immediately  commenced operations. He sold some property which he possessed near  Cracow, and with the proceeds led a merry life at Dresden. He gave the  most elegant suppers, to which he regularly invited the officers of the  guard, and especially those who did duty at the prison of the alchymist.  He insinuated himself at last into their confidence, and obtained free  ingress to his friend as often as he pleased; pretending that he was  using his utmost endeavours to conquer his obstinacy and worm his secret  out of him. When their project was ripe, a day was fixed upon for the  grand attempt; and Sendivogius was ready with a postchariot to convey  him with all speed into Poland. By drugging some wine which he presented  to the guards of the prison, he rendered them so drowsy that he easily  found means to scale a wall unobserved, with Seton, and effect his  escape. Seton's wife was in the chariot awaiting him, having safely in  her possession a small packet of a black powder, which was, in fact,  the philosopher's stone, or ingredient for the transmutation of iron and  copper into gold. They all arrived in safety at Cracow; but the frame of  Seton was so wasted by torture of body and starvation, to say nothing  of the anguish of mind he had endured, that he did not long survive.  He died in Cracow in 1603 or 1604, and was buried under the cathedral  church of that city. Such is the story related of the author of the  various works which bear the name of the Cosmopolite. A list of them  may be found in the third volume "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],[0,"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#20)"],[1,"end to which so much marvellous mechanism is  chiefly adapted. Cross-fertilized blossoms defeat self-fertilized  flowers in the struggle for existence.    No wonder Sprengel's theory was disproved by his scornful contemporaries  in the very case of his Wild Geranium, which sheds its pollen before it  has developed a stigma to receive any; therefore no insect that had not  brought pollen from an earlier bloom could possibly fertilize this  flower. How amazing that he did not see this! Our common wild  crane's-bill, which also has lost the power to fertilize itself, not  only ripens first the outer, then the inner, row of anthers, but  actually drops them off after their pollen has been removed, to overcome  the barest chance of self-fertilization as the stigmas become receptive.  This is the geranium's and many other flowers' method to compel  cross-fertilization by insects. In cold, stormy, cloudy weather a  geranium blossom may remain in the male stage several days before  becoming female; while on a warm, sunny day, when plenty of insects are  flying, the change sometimes takes place in a few hours. Among others,  the common sulphur or puddle butterfly, that sits in swarms on muddy  roads and makes the clover fields gay with its bright little wings,  pilfers nectar from the geranium without bringing its long tongue in  contact with the pollen. Neither do the smaller bees and flies which  alight on the petals necessarily come in contact with the anthers and  stigmas. Doubtless the larger bees are the flowers' true benefactors.    The so-called geraniums in cultivation are pelargoniums, strictly  speaking.      Herb Robert; Red Robin; Red Shanks; Dragon's Blood    _Geranium Robertianum_    _Flowers_--Purplish rose, about 1/2 in. across, borne chiefly in pairs  on slender peduncles. Five sepals and petals; stamens 10; pistil with 5  styles. _Stem_: Weak, slender, much branched, forked, and spreading,  slightly hairy, 6 to 18 in. high. _Leaves_: Strongly scented, opposite,  thin, of 3 divisions, much subdivided and cleft. _Fruit_: Capsular,  elastic, the beak 1 in. long, awn-pointed.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rocky, moist woods and shady roadsides.    _Flowering Season_--May-October.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Pennsylvania, and westward to Missouri.    Who was the Robert for whom this his \"holy herb\" was named? Many suppose  that he was St. Robert, a Benedictine monk, to whom the twenty-ninth of  April--the day the plant comes into flower in Europe--is dedicated.  Others assert that Robert Duke of Normandy, for whom the \"Ortus  Sanitatis,\" a standard medical guide for some hundred of years, was  written, is the man honored; and since there is now no way of deciding  the mooted question, we may take our choice.    Only when the stems are young are they green; later the plant well earns  the name of Red Shanks, and when its leaves show crimson stains, of  Dragon's Blood.    At any time the herb gives forth a disagreeable odor, but especially  when its leaves and stem have been crushed until they emit a resinous  secretion once an alleged cure for the plague.          MILKWORT FAMILY _(Polygalaceae)_      Fringed Milkwort or Polygala; Flowering Wintergreen; Gay Wings    _Polygala paucifolia_    _Flowers_--Purplish rose, rarely white, showy, over 1/2 in. long, from 1  to 4 on short, slender peduncles from among upper leaves. Calyx of 5  unequal sepals, of which 2 are wing-like and highly colored like petals.  Corolla irregular, its crest finely fringed; 6 stamens; 1 pistil. Also  pale, pouch-like, cleistogamous flowers underground. _Stem_: Prostrate,  6 to 15 in. long, slender, from creeping rootstock, sending up flowering  shoots 4 to 7 in. high. _Leaves_: Clustered at summit, oblong, or  pointed egg-shaped, 1-1/2 in. long or less; those on lower part of  shoots scale-like.    _Preferred Habitat_--Moist, rich woods, pine lands, light soil.    _Flowering Season_--May-July.    _Distribution_--Northern Canada, southward and westward to Georgia  and Illinois.    Gay companies of these charming, bright little blossoms hidden away in  the woods suggest a swarm of tiny mauve butterflies that have settled  among the wintergreen leaves. Unlike the common milkwort and many of its  kin that grow in clover-like heads, each one of the gay wings has  beauty enough to stand alone. Its oddity of structure, its lovely color  and enticing fringe, lead one to suspect it of extraordinary desire to  woo some insect that will carry its pollen from blossom to blossom and  so enable the plant to produce cross-fertilized seed to counteract the  evil tendencies resulting from the more prolific self-fertilized  cleistogamous flowers buried in the ground below.      Common, Field, or Purple Milkwort; Purple Polygala    _Polygala sanguinea (P. viridescens)_    _Flowers_--Numerous, very small, variable; bright magenta pink, or  almost red, or pale to whiteness, or greenish, clustered in a globular  clover-like head, gradually lengthening to a cylindric spike. _Stem_: 6  to 15 in. high, smooth, branched above, leafy. _Leaves_: Alternate,  narrowly oblong, entire.    _Preferred Habitat_--Fields and meadows, moist or sandy.    _Flowering Season_--June-September.    _Distribution_--Southern Canada to North Carolina, westward to the  Mississippi.    When these bright clover-like heads and the inconspicuous greenish ones  grow together, the difference between them is so striking it is no  wonder Linnaeus thought they were borne by two distinct species,  _Sanguinea_ and _viridescens_, whereas they are now known to be merely  two forms of the same flower. At first glance one might mistake the  irregular little blossom for a member of the pea family; two of the five  very unequal sepals--not petals--are colored wings. These bright-hued  calyx-parts overlap around the flower-head like tiles on a roof. Within  each pair of wings are three petals united into a tube, split on the  back, to expose the vital organs to contact with the bee, the milkwort's  best friend.    Plants of this genus were named polygala, the Greek for much milk, not  because they have milky juice--for it is bitter and clear--but because  feeding on them is supposed to increase the flow of cattle's milk.          TOUCH-ME-NOT FAMILY _(Balsaminaceae)_      Jewel-weed; Spotted Touch-me-not; Silver Cap; Wild Balsam; Lady's  Eardrops; Snap Weed; Wild Lady's Slipper    _Impatiens biflora (I. fulva)_    _Flowers_--Orange yellow, spotted with reddish brown, irregular, 1 in.  long or less, horizontal, 2 to 4 pendent by slender footstalks on a long  peduncle from leaf axils. Sepals, 3, colored; 1 large, sac-shaped,  contracted into a slender incurved spur and 2-toothed at apex; 2 other  sepals small. Petals, 3; 2 of them 2-cleft into dissimilar lobes; 5  short stamens, 1 pistil. _Stem_: 2 to 5 ft. high, smooth, branched,  colored, succulent. _Leaves_: Alternate, thin, pale beneath, ovate  coarsely toothed, petioled. _Fruit_: An oblong capsule, its 5 valves  opening elastically to expel the seeds.    _Preferred Habitat_--Beside streams, ponds, ditches; moist ground.    _Flowering Season_--July-October.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Oregon, south to Missouri and Florida.    These exquisite, bright flowers, hanging at a horizontal, like jewels  from a lady's ear, may be responsible for the plant's folk-name; but  whoever is abroad early on a dewy morning, or after a shower, and finds  notched edges of the drooping leaves hung with scintillating gems,  dancing, sparkling in the sunshine, sees still another reason for naming  this the Jewel-weed. In a brook, pond, spring, or wayside trough, which  can never be far from its haunts, dip a spray of the plant to transform  the leaves into glistening silver. They shed water much as the  nasturtiums do.    When the tiny ruby-throated humming bird flashes northward out of the  tropics to spend the summer, where can he hope to find nectar so deeply  secreted that not even the long-tongued bumblebee may rob him of it all?  Beyond the bird's bill his tongue can be run out and around curves no  other creature can reach. Now the early-blooming columbine, its slender  cornucopias brimming with sweets, welcomes the messenger whose  needle-like bill will carry pollen from flower to flower; presently the  coral honeysuckle and the scarlet painted-cup attract him by wearing his  favorite color; next the jewel-weed hangs horns of plenty to lure his  eye; and the trumpet vine and cardinal flower continue to feed him  successively in Nature's garden; albeit cannas, nasturtiums, salvia,  gladioli, and such deep, irregular showy flowers in men's flower beds  sometimes lure him away.    Familiar as we may be with the nervous little seed-pods of the  touch-me-not, which children ever love to pop and see the seeds fly, as  they do from balsam pods in grandmother's garden, they still startle  with the suddenness of their volley. Touch the delicate hair-trigger at  the end of a capsule, and the lightning response of the flying seeds  makes one jump. They sometimes land four feet away. At this rate of  progress a year, and with the other odds against which all plants have  to contend, how many generations must it take to fringe even one mill  pond with jewel-weed; yet this is rapid transit indeed compared with  many of Nature's processes. The plant is a conspicuous sufferer from  the dodder.           *       *       *       *       *    The Pale Touch-me-not _(I. aurea)_--_I. pallida_ of Gray--most abundant  northward, a larger, stouter species found in similar situations, but  with paler yellow flowers only sparingly dotted if at all, has its  broader sac-shaped sepal abruptly contracted into a short, notched, but  not incurved spur. It shares its sister's popular names.          BUCKTHORN FAMILY _(Rhamnaceae)_      New Jersey Tea; Wild Snowball; Red-root    _Ceanothus americanus_    _Flowers_--Small, white, on white pedicels, crowded in dense, oblong,"]]]
