It must be remembered, however, that although harm in the forge may  frequently arise from culpable roughness or carelessness, such is not  necessarily always the case, and that quite as much injury may result from  careful and conscientious workmanship when it is unfortunate enough to be  based upon principles wrong in themselves to commence with.    It so happens, too, that shoeing, in itself a necessary evil, may be  responsible for injuries in the causation of which the smith can have  played no part. Take, for example, the ill effects following upon the  animal's attendant allowing him to carry his shoes for too long a time.  In this case the natural growth of the horn carries the heel of the shoe  further beneath the foot than is safe for a correct bearing; in fact,  anterior to the point of inflection of the wall. The shoe, at the same  time, is greatly thinned from excessive wear. Result, a sharp and  easily-bended piece of iron situate immediately under the seat of corn.  Pressure or actual cutting of the sole is bound to occur, and the animal is  lamed.    Again, apart from the question of negligence or otherwise on the part of  the smith or the animal's attendant, it must be remembered that the nailing  on to the foot of a plate of iron is not giving to the animal an easier  means of progression. The reverse is the case. In place of the sucker-like  face of the natural horn is substituted a smooth, and, with wear,  highly-polished surface. Slipping and sliding attempts to gain a foothold  become frequent, and strains of the tendons and ligaments follow in their  wake.    As, however, this treatise is not intended to deal with the art of shoeing,  the reader must be referred to other works for further information. In  addition to Fleming's, there may be mentioned, among others, Hunting's 'Art  of Horse Shoeing,' and the very excellent volume of Messrs. Dollar and  Wheatley on the same subject. Leaving the forge, we may next look to the  nature of the animal's work, and the conditions under which he is kept, for  active causes in the production of disorders of the foot. From the yielding  softness of the pasture he is called to spend the bulk of his time upon the  hard macadamized tracks of our country roads, or the still more hard and  more dangerous asphalt pavings or granite sets of our towns. The former,  with the bruises they will give the sole and frog from loose and scattered  stones, and the latter, with the increased concussion they will entail on  the limb, are active factors in the troubles with which we are about to  deal. Upon these unyielding surfaces the horse is called to carry slowly or  rapidly, as the case may be, not only his own weight, but, in addition, is  asked to labour at the hauling of heavy loads. The effects of concussion  and heavy traction combined are bound primarily to find the feet, and such  diseases as side-bones, ringbones, corns, and sand-cracks commence to make  their appearance.    Again, as opposed to the comparative healthiness of the surroundings when  at grass, consideration must be given to the chemical changes the foot is  frequently subjected to when the animal is housed.    Only too often the bedding the animal has to stand upon for several hours  of the twenty-four can only be fitly described as 'filthy in the extreme.'  The ammoniacal exhalations from these collected body-discharges must, and  do, have a prejudicial effect upon the nature of the horn, and, though slow  in its progress, mischief is bound sooner or later to occur in the shape of  a weakened and discharging frog, with its concomitant of contracted heels.  Lucky it is in such a case if canker does not follow on.    Observers, too, have chronicled the occurrence in horse's feet of disease  resulting from the use of moss litter. Tenderness in the foot is first  noticeable, which tenderness is afterwards followed by a peculiar softening  of the horn of the sole and the frog. What should be a dense, fairly  resilient substance is transformed into a material affording a yielding  sensation to the fingers not unlike that imparted by a soft indiarubber,  and as easily sliced as cheese-rind.    Lastly, though the foot is extremely liable to suffer from the effects  of extreme dryness or excessive humidity, especially with regard to the  changes thus brought about in the nature of the horn, it is perforce  exposed at all times to the varying condition of the roads upon which it  must travel. The intense dryness of summer and the constant damp of winter,  each in their turn take part in the deteriorating influences at work upon  it.    Though this subject might be indefinitely prolonged, this brief resume of  the adverse circumstances to which the foot of the horse is exposed  is sufficient to point out the extreme importance of its study to the  veterinary surgeon. So long as the horse is used as a beast of burden so  long will this branch of veterinary surgery offer a wide and remunerative  field of labour.        CHAPTER II    REGIONAL ANATOMY      Considered from a zoological standpoint, the foot of the horse will include  all those parts from the knee and hock downwards. For the purposes of this  treatise, however, the word foot will be used in its more popular sense,  and will refer solely to those portions of the digit contained within  the hoof. When, in this chapter on regional anatomy, or elsewhere, the  descriptive matter or the illustrations exceed that limit, it will be with  the object of observing the relationship between the parts we are concerned  with and adjoining structures.    Taking the limit we have set, and enumerating the parts within the hoof  from within outwards, we find them as follows:    A. THE BONES.--The lower portion of the second phalanx or os coronae; the  third phalanx, os pedis, or coffin bone; and the navicular or shuttle bone.    B. THE LIGAMENTS.--The ligaments binding the articulation.    C. THE TENDONS.--The terminal portions of the extensor pedis and the flexor  perforans.    D. THE ARTERIES.    E. THE VEINS.    F. THE NERVES.    G. THE COMPLEMENTARY APPARATUS OF THE OS PEDIS.    H. THE KERATOGENOUS MEMBRANE.    I. THE HOOF.      A. THE BONES.    THE SECOND PHALANX, OS CORONAE, OR SMALL PASTERN BONE.--This belongs to  the class of small bones, in that it possesses no medullary canal. It is  situated obliquely in the digit, running from above downwards and from  behind to before, and articulating superiorly with the first phalanx or os  suffraginis, and inferiorly with the third phalanx and the navicular bone.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE BONES OF THE PHALANX. 1, The os suffraginis; 2,  the os coronae; 3, the os pedis; 4, the navicular bone, hidden by the wing  of the os pedis, is in articulation in the position indicated by the barbed  line.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--SECOND PHALANX OR OS CORONAE (ANTERIOR VIEW).  1, Anterior surface; 2, superior articulatory surface; 3, inferior  articulatory surface; 4, pits for ligamentous attachment.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--SECOND PHALANX OR OS CORONAE (POSTERIOR VIEW). 1,  Posterior surface; 2, gliding surface for passage of flexor perforans; 3,  lower articulatory surface.]    Cubical in shape, it is flattened from before to behind, and may be  described as possessing six surfaces: _An anterior surface_, covered with  slight imprints; _a posterior surface_, provided above with a transversely  elongated gliding surface for the passage of the flexor perforans; _two  lateral surfaces_, each rough and perforated by foraminae, and each bearing  on its lower portion a thumb-like imprint for ligamentous attachment, and  for the insertion of the bifid extremity of the perforatus tendon; _a  superior surface_, bearing two shallow articular cavities, separated by an  antero-posterior ridge, for the accommodation of the lower articulating  surface of the first phalanx; _an inferior surface_, also articulatory,  which in shape is obverse to the superior, bearing two unequal condyles,  separated by an ill-defined antero-posterior groove, which surface  articulates with the os pedis and the navicular bone.    _Development_.--The bone usually ossifies from one centre, but often there  is a complementary nucleus for the upper surface.    THE THIRD PHALANX, OS PEDIS, OR COFFIN BONE.--This also belongs to the  class of short bones. It forms the termination of the digit, and, with the  navicular bone, is included entirely within the hoof. For our examination  it offers _three surfaces_, _two lateral angles_, and _three edges_.    _The Anterior or Laminal Surface_, following closely in contour the wall of  the hoof, is markedly convex from side to side, nearly straight from above  to below, and closely dotted with foraminae of varying sizes. On each side  of this surface is to be seen a distinct groove, the _preplantar groove_,  or _preplantar fissure_, which, commencing behind, between the basilar and  retrossal processes, runs horizontally forwards from the angles or wings of  the bone, and terminates anteriorly in one of the larger foraminae. As the  name 'laminal' indicates, it is this surface which in the fresh state is  covered by the sensitive laminae.    _The Inferior or Plantar Surface_, hollowed in the form of a low arch,  presents for our inspection two regions, an anterior and a posterior,  divided by a well-marked line, the _Semilunar Crest_, which extends forward  in the shape of a semicircle. The anterior region, as is the laminal  surface, is covered with foraminae; in this case more minute. In the recent  state it is covered by the sensitive sole. The posterior region, lying  immediately behind the semilunar crest, shows on each side of a median  process a large foramen, the _Plantar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11212"],[0,"Modern India (#3)"],[1,"commerce of the country goes through its custom-house.  It is by all odds the finest city between modern Cairo and San  Francisco, and its commercial and industrial interests exceed  that of any other.    The arrangements for landing passengers are admirable. On the  ship all our baggage was marked with numbers corresponding to  that of our declaration to the collector of customs. The steamer  anchored out about a quarter of a mile from a fine covered pier.  We were detained on board until the baggage, even our small pieces,  was taken ashore on one launch and after a while we followed it  on another. Upon reaching the dock we passed up a long aisle to  where several deputy collectors were seated behind desks. As we  gave our names they looked through the bundles of declarations  which had been arranged alphabetically, and, finding the proper  one, told us that we would have to pay a duty of 5 per cent upon  our typewriter and kodaks, and that a receipt and certificate  would be furnished by which we could recover the money at any  port by which we left India. Nothing else was taxed, although  I noticed that nearly every passenger had to pay on something  else. There is only one rate of duty--5 per cent ad valorem upon  everything--jewelry, furniture, machinery--all pay the same,  which simplified the transaction. But the importation of arms  and ammunition is strictly prohibited and every gun, pistol and  cartridge is confiscated in the custom-house unless the owner  can present evidence that he is an officer of the army or navy  and that they are the tools of his trade, or has a permit issued  by the proper authority. This precaution is intended to anticipate  any conspiracy similar to that which led to the great mutiny  of 1857. The natives are not allowed to carry guns or even to  own them, and every gun or other weapon found in the hands of a  Hindu is confiscated unless he has a permit. And as an additional  precaution the rifles issued to the native regiments in the army  have a range of only twelve hundred yards, while those issued to  the white regiments will kill at sixteen hundred yards; thus giving  the latter an important advantage in case of an insurrection.    After having interviewed the deputy collector, we were admitted  to a great pen or corral in the middle of the pier, which is  inclosed by a high fence, and there found all our luggage piled  up together on a bench. And all the trunks and bags and baskets  from the ship were similarly assorted, according to the numbers  they bore. We were not asked to open anything, none of our packages  were examined, the declarations of passengers usually being accepted  as truthful and final unless the inspectors have reason to believe  or suspect deception. Gangs of coolies in livery, each wearing a  brass tag with his number, stood by ready to seize the baggage  and carry it to the hotel wagons, which stood outside, where we  followed it and directed by a polite Sikh policeman, took the  first carriage in line. Everything was conducted in a most orderly  manner. There was no confusion, no jostling and no excitement,  which indicates that the Bombay officials have correct notions  of what is proper and carry them into practice.    The docks of Bombay are the finest in Asia, and when the extensions  now in progress are carried out few cities in Europe can surpass  them. They are planned for a century in advance. The people of  Bombay are not boastful, but they are confident of the growth  of their city and its commerce. Attached to the docks is a story  of integrity and fidelity worth telling. In 1735 the municipal  authorities of the young city, anticipating commercial prosperity,  decided to improve their harbor and build piers for the accommodation  of vessels, but nobody around the place had experience in such  matters and a commission was sent off to other cities of India to  find a man to take charge. The commission was very much pleased  with the appearance and ability of Lowji Naushirwanji, the Parsee  foreman of the harbor at the neighboring town of Surat, and tried  to coax him away by making a very lucrative offer, much in advance  of the pay he was then receiving. He was too loyal and honest to  accept it, and read the commission a lecture on business integrity  which greatly impressed them. When they returned to Bombay and  related their experience, the municipal authorities communicated  with those of Surat and inclosed an invitation to Naushirwanji  to come down and build a dock for Bombay. The offer was so  advantageous that his employers advised him to accept it. He  did so, and from that day to this a man of his name, and one of  his descendants, has been superintendent of the docks of this  city. The office has practically become hereditary in the family.    [Illustration: CLOCK TOWER AND UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS--BOMBAY]    A decided sensation awaits the traveler when he passes out from  the pier into the street, particularly if it is his first visit  to the East. He already has had a glimpse of the gorgeous costumes  of the Hindu gentleman and the priestly looking Parsees, and  the long, cool white robes of the common people, for several  of each class were gathered at the end of the pier to welcome  friends who arrived by the steamer, but the moment that he emerges  from the dock he enters a new and a strange world filled with  vivid colors and fantastic costumes. He sees his first \"gherry,\"  a queer-looking vehicle made of bamboo, painted in odd patterns  and bright tints, and drawn by a cow or a bullock that will trot  almost as fast as a horse. All vehicles, however, are now called  \"gherrys\" in India, no matter where they come from nor how they  are built--the chariot of the viceroy as well as the little donkey  cart of the native fruit peddler.    The extent of bare flesh visible--masculine and feminine--startles  you at first, and the scanty apparel worn by the common people  of both sexes. Working women walk by with their legs bare from  the thighs down, wearing nothing but a single garment wrapped in  graceful folds around their slender bodies. They look very small,  compared with the men, and the first question every stranger asks  is the reason. You are told that they are married in infancy,  that they begin to bear children by the time they are 12 and 14  years old, and consequently do not have time to grow; and perhaps  that is the correct explanation for the diminutive stature of the  women of India. There are exceptions. You see a few stalwart  amazons, but ninety per cent or more of the sex are under size.  Perhaps there is another reason, which does not apply to the upper  classes, and that is the manual labor the coolies women perform,  the loads they carry on their heads and the heavy lifting that  is required of them. If you approach a building in course of  erection you will find that the stone, brick, mortar and other  material is carried up the ladders and across the scaffolding on  the heads of women and girls, and some of these \"hod carriers\"  are not more than 10 or 12 years old. They carry everything on  their heads, and usually it requires two other women or girls to  hoist the heavy burden to the head of the third. All the weight  comes on the spine, and must necessarily prevent or retard growth,  although it gives them an erect and stately carriage, which women  in America might imitate with profit. At the same time, perhaps,  our women might prefer to acquire their carriage in some other  way than \"toting\" a hodful of bricks to the top of a four-story  building.    The second thing that impresses you is the amount of glistening  silver the working women wear upon their naked limbs. To drop  into poetry, like Silas Wegg, they wear rings in their noses  and rings on their toeses, and bands of silver wherever they can  fasten them on their arms and legs and neck. They have bracelets,  anklets, armlets, necklaces, and their noses as well as their  ears are pierced for pendants. You wonder how a woman can eat,  drink or sleep with a great big ornament hanging over her lips,  and some of the earrings must weigh several ounces, for they fall  almost to the shoulders. You will meet a dozen coolie women every  block with two or three pounds of silver ornaments distributed  over their persons, which represent their savings bank, for every  spare rupee is invested in a ring, bracelet or a necklace, which,  of course, does not pay interest, but can be disposed of for  full value in case of an emergency. The workmanship is rude,  but the designs are often pretty, and a collection of the silver  ornaments worn by Hindu women would make an interesting exhibit  for a museum. They are often a burden to them, particularly in hot  weather, when they chafe and burn the flesh, and our Bombay friends  tell us that in the summer the fountain basins, the hydrants and  every other place where water can be found will be surrounded  by women bathing the spots where the silver ornaments have seared  the skin and cooling the metal, which is often so hot as to burn  the fingers.    Another feature of Bombay life which immediately seizes the attention  is the gay colors worn by everybody, which makes the streets  look like animated rainbows or the kaleidoscopes that you can  buy at the 10-cent stores. Orange and scarlet predominate, but  yellow, pink, purple, green, blue and every other tint that was  ever invented appears in the robes of the Hindus you meet upon the  street. A dignified old gentleman will cross your path with a pink  turban on his head and a green scarf wound around his shoulders.  The next man you meet may have a pair of scarlet stockings, a  purple robe and a tunic of wine-colored velvet embroidered in  gold. There seems to be no rule or regulation about the use of  colors and no set fashion for raiment. The only uniformity in  the costume worn by the men of India is that everybody's legs  are bare. Most men "]]]
