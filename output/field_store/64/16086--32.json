BABY DOLLY    Hush, baby, my dolly, I pray you don't cry,  And I'll give you some bread, and some milk by-and-by;  Or perhaps you like custard, or, maybe, a tart,  Then to either you're welcome, with all my heart.      BEES    A swarm of bees in May  Is worth a load of hay;  A swarm of bees in June  Is worth a silver spoon;  A swarm of bees in July  Is not worth a fly.      COME OUT TO PLAY    Girls and boys, come out to play,  The moon doth shine as bright as day;  Leave your supper, and leave your sleep,  And come with your playfellows into the street.  Come with a whoop, come with a call,  Come with a good will or not at all.  Up the ladder and down the wall,  A half-penny roll will serve us all.  You find milk, and I'll find flour,  And we'll have a pudding in half an hour.      IF WISHES WERE HORSES    If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.  If turnips were watches, I would wear one by my side.      And if \"ifs\" and \"ands\"      Were pots and pans,  There'd be no work for tinkers!      TO MARKET    To market, to market, to buy a fat pig.  Home again, home again, jiggety jig.  To market, to market, to buy a fat hog,  Home again, home again, jiggety jog.

OLD CHAIRS TO MEND    If I'd as much money as I could spend,  I never would cry old chairs to mend;  Old chairs to mend, old chairs to mend;  I never would cry old chairs to mend.    If I'd as much money as I could tell,  I never would cry old clothes to sell;  Old clothes to sell, old clothes to sell;  I never would cry old clothes to sell.      ROBIN AND RICHARD    Robin and Richard were two pretty men,  They lay in bed till the clock struck ten;  Then up starts Robin and looks at the sky,  \"Oh, brother Richard, the sun's very high!  You go before, with the bottle and bag,  And I will come after on little Jack Nag.\"      A MAN AND A MAID        There was a little man,      Who wooed a little maid,  And he said, \"Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?      I have little more to say,      So will you, yea or nay,  For least said is soonest mended-ded, ded, ded.\"        The little maid replied,      \"Should I be your little bride,  Pray what must we have for to eat, eat, eat?      Will the flame that you're so rich in      Light a fire in the kitchen?  Or the little god of love turn the spit, spit, spit?\"      HERE GOES MY LORD          Here goes my lord  A trot, a trot, a trot, a trot,        Here goes my lady  A canter, a canter, a canter, a canter!

THE CLEVER HEN    I had a little hen, the prettiest ever seen,  She washed me the dishes and kept the house clean;  She went to the mill to fetch me some flour,  She brought it home in less than an hour;  She baked me my bread, she brewed me my ale,  She sat by the fire and told many a fine tale.      TWO BIRDS    There were two birds sat on a stone,      Fa, la, la, la, lal, de;  One flew away, and then there was one,      Fa, la, la, la, lal, de;  The other bird flew after,  And then there was none,      Fa, la, la, la, lal, de;  And so the stone  Was left alone,      Fa, la, la, la, lal, de.

WHEN JENNY WREN WAS YOUNG    'Twas once upon a time, when Jenny Wren was young,  So daintily she danced and so prettily she sung,  Robin Redbreast lost his heart, for he was a gallant bird.  So he doffed his hat to Jenny Wren, requesting to be heard.    \"Oh, dearest Jenny Wren, if you will but be mine,  You shall feed on cherry pie and drink new currant wine,  I'll dress you like a goldfinch or any peacock gay,  So, dearest Jen, if you'll be mine, let us appoint the day.\"    Jenny blushed behind her fan and thus declared her mind:  \"Since, dearest Bob, I love you well, I'll take your offer kind.  Cherry pie is very nice and so is currant wine,  But I must wear my plain brown gown and never go too fine.\"      BARBER    Barber, barber, shave a pig.  How many hairs will make a wig?  Four and twenty; that's enough.  Give the barber a pinch of snuff.      THE FLYING PIG    Dickory, dickory, dare,  The pig flew up in the air;  The man in brown soon brought        him down,            Dickory,              dickory,                dare.

For to say that slaves are honourably obtained on the  coast; to say that their treatment is of the mildest nature, and yet to  propose the above-mentioned regulations as necessary, is to refute  himself more clearly, than I confess myself to be able to do it: and I  have only to request, that the regulations proposed by this writer, in  the defence of slavery, may be considered as so many proofs of the  assertions contained in my own work.    I shall close my account with an observation, which is of great  importance in the present case. Of all the publications in favour of the  slave-trade, or the subsequent slavery in the colonies, there is not  one, which has not been written, either by a chaplain to the African  factories, or by a merchant, or by a planter, or by a person whose  interest has been connected in the cause which he has taken upon him to  defend. Of this description are Mr. _Tobin_, and the _Apologist  for Negroe Slavery_. While on the other hand those, who have had as  competent a knowledge of the subject, but not the _same interest_  as themselves, have unanimously condemned it; and many of them have  written their sentiments upon it, at the hazard of creating an  innumerable host of enemies, and of being subjected to the most  malignant opposition. Now, which of these are we to believe on the  occasion? Are we to believe those, who are parties concerned, who are  interested in the practice?--But the question does not admit of a  dispute.    Concerning my own work, it seems proper to observe, that when, the  original Latin Dissertation, as the title page expresses, was honoured  by the University of Cambridge with the first of their annual prizes for  the year 1785, I was waited upon by some gentlemen of respectability and  consequence, who requested me to publish it in English. The only  objection which occurred to me was this; that having been prevented, by  an attention to other studies, from obtaining that critical knowledge of  my own language, which was necessary for an English composition, I was  fearful of appearing before the publick eye: but that, as they flattered  me with the hope, that the publication of it might be of use, I would  certainly engage to publish it, if they would allow me to postpone it  for a little time, till I was more in the habit of writing. They  replied, that as the publick attention was now excited to the case of  the unfortunate _Africans_, it would be serving the cause with  double the effect, if it were to be published within a few months. This  argument prevailed. Nothing but this circumstance could have induced me  to offer an English composition to the inspection of an host of  criticks: and I trust therefore that this circumstance will plead much  with the benevolent reader, in favour of those faults, which he may find  in the present work.    Having thus promised to publish it, I was for some time doubtful from  which of the copies to translate. There were two, the original, and an  abridgement. The latter (as these academical compositions are generally  of a certain length) was that which was sent down to Cambridge, and  honoured with the prize. I was determined however, upon consulting with  my friends, to translate from the former. This has been faithfully done  with but few[003] additions. The reader will probably perceive the Latin  idiom in several passages of the work, though I have endeavoured, as far  as I have been able, to avoid it. And I am so sensible of the  disadvantages under which it must yet lie, as a translation, that I wish  I had written upon the subject, without any reference at all to the  original copy.    It will perhaps be asked, from what authority I have collected those  facts, which relate to the colonial slavery. I reply, that I have had  the means of the very best of information on the subject; having the  pleasure of being acquainted with many, both in the naval and military  departments, as well as with several others, who have been long  acquainted with _America_ and the _West-Indian_ islands. The  facts therefore which I have related, are compiled from the  disinterested accounts of these gentlemen, all of whom, I have the  happiness to say, have coincided, in the minutest manner, in their  descriptions. It mud be remarked too, that they were compiled, not from  what these gentlemen heard, while they were resident in those parts, but  from what they actually _saw_. Nor has a single instance been taken  from any book whatever upon the subject, except that which is mentioned  in the 235th page; and this book was published in _France_, in the  year 1777, by _authority_.    I have now the pleasure to say, that the accounts of these disinterested  gentlemen, whom I consulted on the occasion, are confirmed by all the  books which I have ever perused upon slavery, except those which have  been written by _merchants, planters, &c_. They are confirmed by  Sir _Hans Sloane's_ Voyage to Barbadoes; _Griffith Hughes's_  History of the same island, printed 1750; an Account of North America,  by _Thomas Jeffries_, 1761; all _Benezet's_ works, &c. &c. and  particularly by Mr. _Ramsay's_ Essay on the Treatment and  Conversion of the African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies; a work  which is now firmly established; and, I may add in a very extraordinary  manner, in consequence of the controversy which this gentleman has  sustained with the _Cursory Remarker_, by which several facts which  were mentioned in the original copy of my own work, before the  controversy began, and which had never appeared in any work upon the  subject, have been brought to light. Nor has it received less support  from a letter, published only last week, from Capt. J.S. Smith, of the  Royal Navy, to the Rev. Mr. Hill; on the former of whom too high  encomiums cannot be bestowed, for standing forth in that noble and  disinterested manner, in behalf of an injured character.    I have now only to solicit the reader again, that he will make a  favourable allowance for the present work, not only from those  circumstances which I have mentioned, but from the consideration, that  only two months are allowed by the University for these their annual  compositions. Should he however be unpropitious to my request, I must  console myself with the reflection, (a reflection that will always  afford me pleasure, even amidst the censures of the great,) that by  undertaking the cause of the unfortunate _Africans_, I have  undertaken, as far as my abilities would permit, the cause of injured  innocence.
