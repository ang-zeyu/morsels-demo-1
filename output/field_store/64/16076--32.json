We will begin with the  last, and consider what those faults are which a writer of history  should be free from; next, what it is that will lead him into the  right path, how he should begin, what order and method he should  observe, what he should pass over in silence, and what he should  dwell upon, how things may be best illustrated and connected.  Of  these, and such as these, we will speak hereafter; in the meantime  let us point out the faults which bad writers are most generally  guilty of, the blunders which they commit in language, composition,  and sentiment, with many other marks of ignorance, which it would be  tedious to enumerate, and belong not to our present argument.  The  principal faults, as I observed to you, are in the language and  composition.    You will find on examination, that history in general has a great  many of this kind, which, if you listen to them all, you will be  sufficiently convinced of; and for this purpose it may not be  unseasonable to recollect some of them by way of example.  And the  first that I shall mention is that intolerable custom which most of  them have of omitting facts, and dwelling for ever on the praises of  their generals and commanders, extolling to the skies their own  leaders, and degrading beyond measure those of their enemies, not  knowing how much history differs from panegyric, that there is a  great wall between them, or that, to use a musical phrase, they are  a double octave {24a} distant from each other; the sole business of  the panegyrist is, at all events and by every means, to extol and  delight the object of his praise, and it little concerns him whether  it be true or not.  But history will not admit the least degree of  falsehood any more than, as physicians say, the wind-pipe {24b} can  receive into it any kind of food.    These men seem not to know that poetry has its particular rules and  precepts; and that history is governed by others directly opposite.  That with regard to the former, the licence is immoderate, and there  is scarce any law but what the poet prescribes to himself.  When he  is full of the Deity, and possessed, as it were, by the Muses, if he  has a mind to put winged horses {25a} to his chariot, and drive some  through the waters, and others over the tops of unbending corn,  there is no offence taken.  Neither, if his Jupiter {25b} hangs the  earth and sea at the end of a chain, are we afraid that it should  break and destroy us all.  If he wants to extol Agamemnon, who shall  forbid his bestowing on him the head and eyes of Jupiter, the breast  of his brother Neptune, and the belt of Mars?  The son of Atreus and  AErope must be a composition of all the gods; nor are Jupiter, Mars,  and Neptune sufficient, perhaps, of themselves to give us an idea of  his perfection.  But if history admits any adulation of this kind,  it becomes a sort of prosaic poetry, without its numbers or  magnificence; a heap of monstrous stories, only more conspicuous by  their incredibility.  He is unpardonable, therefore, who cannot  distinguish one from the other; but lays on history the paint of  poetry, its flattery, fable, and hyperbole:  it is just as  ridiculous as it would be to clothe one of our robust wrestlers, who  is as hard as an oak, in fine purple, or some such meretricious  garb, and put paint {26} on his cheeks; how would such ornaments  debase and degrade him!  I do not mean by this, that in history we  are not to praise sometimes, but it must be done at proper seasons,  and in a proper degree, that it may not offend the readers of future  ages; for future ages must be considered in this affair, as I shall  endeavour to prove hereafter.    Those, I must here observe, are greatly mistaken who divide history  into two parts, the useful and the agreeable; and in consequence of  it, would introduce panegyric as always delectable and entertaining  to the reader.  But the division itself is false and delusive; for  the great end and design of history is to be useful:  a species of  merit which can only arise from its truth.  If the agreeable  follows, so much the better, as there may be beauty in a wrestler.  And yet Hercules would esteem the brave though ugly Nicostratus as  much as the beautiful Alcaeus.  And thus history, when she adds  pleasure to utility, may attract more admirers; though as long as  she is possessed of that greatest of perfections, truth, she need  not be anxious concerning beauty.    In history, nothing fabulous can be agreeable; and flattery is  disgusting to all readers, except the very dregs of the people; good  judges look with the eyes of Argus on every part, reject everything  that is false and adulterated, and will admit nothing but what is  true, clear, and well expressed.  These are the men you are to have  a regard to when you write, rather than the vulgar, though your  flattery should delight them ever so much.  If you stuff history  with fulsome encomiums and idle tales, you will make her like  Hercules in Lydia, as you may have seen him painted, waiting upon  Omphale, who is dressed in the lion's skin, with his club in her  hand; whilst he is represented clothed in yellow and purple, and  spinning, and Omphale beating him with her slipper; a ridiculous  spectacle, wherein everything manly and godlike is sunk and degraded  to effeminacy.    The multitude perhaps, indeed, may admire such things; but the  judicious few whose opinion you despise will always laugh at what is  absurd, incongruous, and inconsistent.  Everything has a beauty  peculiar to itself; but if you put one instead of another, the most  beautiful becomes ugly, because it is not in its proper place.  I  need not add, that praise is agreeable only to the person praised,  and disgustful to everybody else, especially when it is lavishly  bestowed; as is the practice of most writers, who are so extremely  desirous of recommending themselves by flattery, and dwell so much  upon it as to convince the reader it is mere adulation, which they  have not art enough to conceal, but heap up together, naked,  uncovered, and totally incredible, so that they seldom gain what  they expected from it; for the person flattered, if he has anything  noble or manly in him, only abhors and despises them for it as mean  parasites.  Aristobulus, after he had written an account of the  single combat between Alexander and Porus, showed that monarch a  particular part of it, wherein, the better to get into his good  graces, he had inserted a great deal more than was true; when  Alexander seized the book and threw it (for they happened at that  time to be sailing on the Hydaspes) directly into the river:  \"Thus,\" said he, \"ought you to have been served yourself for  pretending to describe my battles, and killing half a dozen  elephants for me with a single spear.\"  This anger was worthy of  Alexander, of him who could not bear the adulation of that architect  {29} who promised to transform Mount Athos into a statue of him; but  he looked upon the man from that time as a base flatterer, and never  employed him afterwards.    What is there in this custom, therefore, that can be agreeable,  unless to the proud and vain; to deformed men or ugly women, who  insist on being painted handsome, and think they shall look better  if the artist gives them a little more red and white!  Such, for the  most part, are the historians of our times, who sacrifice everything  to the present moment and their own interest and advantage; who can  only be despised as ignorant flatterers of the age they live in; and  as men, who, at the same time, by their extravagant stories, make  everything which they relate liable to suspicion.  If  notwithstanding any are still of opinion, that the agreeable should  be admitted in history, let them join that which is pleasant with  that which is true, by the beauties of style and diction, instead of  foisting in, as is commonly done, what is nothing to the purpose.    I will now acquaint you with some things I lately picked up in Ionia  and Achaia, from several historians, who gave accounts of this war.  By the graces I beseech you to give me credit for what I am going to  tell you, as I could swear to the truth of it, if it were polite to  swear in a dissertation.  One of these gentlemen begins by invoking  the Muses, and entreats the goddesses to assist him in the  performance.  What an excellent setting out and how properly is this  form of speech adapted to history!  A little farther on, he compares  our emperor to Achilles, and the Persian king to Thersites; not  considering that his Achilles would have been a much greater man if  he had killed Hector rather than Thersites; if the brave should fly,  he who pursues must be braver.  Then follows an encomium on himself,  showing how worthy he is to recite such noble actions; and when he  is got on a little, he extols his own country, Miletus, adding that  in this he had acted better than Homer, who never tells us where he  was born.  He informs us, moreover, at the end of his preface, in  the most plain and positive terms, that he shall take care to make  the best he can of our own affairs, and, as far as lies in his  power, to get the upper hand of our enemies the barbarians.  After  investigating the cause of the war, he begins thus:  \"That vilest of  all wretches, Vologesus, entered upon the war for these reasons.\"  Such is this historian's manner.  Another, a close imitator of  Thucydides, that he may set out as his master does, gives us an  exordium that smells of the true Attic honey, and begins thus:  \"Creperius Calpurnianus, a citizen of Pompeia, hath written the  history of the war between the Parthians and the Romans, showing how  they fought with one another, commencing at"]]]
