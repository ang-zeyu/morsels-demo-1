For the various infrahuman animals whose ideational behavior has been  studied by means of this method, it has been found eminently  satisfactory to use as reaction-mechanisms a series of similar boxes,  each with an entrance and an exit door. An incentive to the selection of  the right box in a particular test is supplied by food, a small quantity  of which is placed in a covered receptacle beyond the exit door of each  of the boxes. Each time an animal enters a wrong box, it is punished for  its mistake by being confined in that box for a certain period, ranging  from five seconds to as much as two minutes with various individuals or  types of organism. This discourages random, hasty, or careless choices.  When the right box is selected, the exit door is immediately raised,  thus uncovering the food, which serves as a reward. After eating the  food thus provided, the animal, according to training, returns to the  starting point and eagerly awaits an opportunity to attempt once more to  find the reward which it has learned to expect. With this form of the  apparatus, the boxes among which choice may be made are indicated by the  raising (opening) of the front door.    Since with various birds and mammals the box form of apparatus had  proved most satisfactory, I planned the primate apparatus along similar  lines, aiming simply to adapt it to the somewhat different motor  equipment and destructive tendencies of the monkeys. I shall now briefly  describe this apparatus as it was constructed and used in the Montecito  laboratory.        EXPLANATION OF PLATE IV    FIGURE 13.--Multiple-choice apparatus, showing observer's bench     and writing stand.  FIGURE 14.--Apparatus as seen from observer's bench.  FIGURE 15.--Entrances to multiple-choice boxes as seen from     the response-compartment.  FIGURE 16.--Apparatus as seen from the rear, showing exit     doors, food receptacles, and covers for same.        The apparatus was built in room A (figure 12), this room having been  especially planned for it with respect to lighting as well as dimensions  and approaches. It was unfortunately impossible to obtain photographs  showing the whole of the apparatus, but it is hoped that the four  partial views of plate IV may aid the reader who is unfamiliar with  previously described similar devices to grasp readily the chief points  of construction. In this plate, figure 13 shows the front of the  complete apparatus, with the alleyway and door by way of which the  experimenter could enter. The investigator's observation-bench and  record-table also appear in this figure, together with weighted cords  used to operate the various doors and the vertically placed levers by  means of which each pair of doors could be locked. Figure 14 is the view  presented to the observer as he stood on the bench or observation stand  of figure 13 and looked over the entire apparatus. Three of the entrance  doors are shown at the right of this figure as raised, whereas the  remainder of the nine entrance doors of the apparatus are closed. Figure  15 is a view of the entrance doors from below the wire roof of the  apparatus. Again, two of the doors are shown as raised, and three  additional ones as closed. The rear of the apparatus appears in figure  16, in which some of the exit doors are closed and others open. In the  latter case, the food receptacles appear, and on the lower part of the  raised doors of the corresponding boxes may be seen metal covers for the  food receptacles projecting at right angles to the doors, while on the  lower edge of each door is an iron staple used to receive a sliding bar  which could be operated from the observer's bench as a means of locking  the doors after they had been closed. The space beyond the exit doors  was used as an alleyway for the return of the animals to the starting  point.    It will be necessary at various points in later descriptions to refer to  these several figures. But further description of them will be more  readily appreciated after a careful examination of the ground plan of  the apparatus presented as figure 17 In accordance with the labelling of  this figure, the experimenter enters the apparatus room through doorway  16, passes thence through doorways 17 and 10 to the large cage Z, from  which he has direct access to the animals and can bring them into the  apparatus. The multiple-choice mechanism proper, consisting of nine  similar boxes (nine were used instead of twelve as a matter of  convenience of construction, not because this smaller number is  otherwise preferable) is labelled F. These boxes are numbered 1 to 9,  beginning at the left. This numbering was adhered to in the recording of  results throughout the investigation. The other important portions of  the apparatus are the runway D, from which the subject at the  experimenter's pleasure could be admitted through doorway 12 to the  large response-chamber E; the alleyways G, H, and I, by way of which  return to the starting point was possible; the observation bench C, with  its approach step 13; and the observer's writing table A.    In the construction of this large apparatus, it was necessary to make  provision for the extremely destructive tendencies of monkeys and  anthropoid apes,--hence the apparent cumbersomeness of certain portions.  It was equally necessary to provide for the protection of the observer  and the prevention of escape of the subjects by completely covering the  apparatus and alleyways with a heavy wire netting.    Each of the eighteen doors of the multiple-choice boxes, and in addition  doors 11, 12, and 15 of the runway D, were operated by the observer from  his bench C by means of weighted window cords which were carried by  pulleys appropriately placed above the apparatus. Each weight was so  chosen as to be just sufficient to hold its door in position after the  experimenter had raised it. For the convenience of the experimenter in  the rapid operation of the twenty-one doors, the weights for the doors  of runway D were painted gray, those for the entrance doors, white, and  those for the exit doors, black.    In each entrance door, as is shown in figure 15 of plate IV, a window  was cut so that the experimenter might watch the animal after it had  entered a given box, and especially note when it left the box after  having received its reward. This window was covered with wire netting.  No such windows were necessary in the exit doors, but to them were  attached heavy galvanized iron flanges which served to cover the food  receptacles. One of these flanges is labelled o in figure 17. The food  receptacles were provided by boring holes in a 2 by 4 inch timber  securely nailed to the floor immediately outside of the exit doors. Into  these holes aluminum cups fitted snugly, and the iron flanges, when the  doors were closed, fitted so closely over the cups that it was  impossible for the animals to obtain food from them.      [Illustration: FIGURE 17.--Ground plan of multiple-choice apparatus in  experiment room A. Scale 1/60    A, record stand; C, bench for observer; B, step as approach to C; D,  alleyway leading to E, response-compartment; F, one of the nine (1-9)  similar multiple-choice boxes; G, H, alleyways leading from boxes to  starting point at D; I, alleyway used by experimenter as approach to  rear of apparatus; W, W, windows; P, alleyway; Z, large cage; 16,  entrance to room A; 17, entrance to apparatus and thence via 10 to  cages; 18, entrance to alleyway 1; 11, 15, entrances to D; 12, entrance  to E; 13, entrance door of box 5; 14, exit door of box 5; o, cover for  food receptacle.]      As originally constructed, no provision was made in the apparatus for  locking the entrance and exit doors of the several boxes when they were  closed. But as two of the subjects after a time learned to open the  doors from either outside or inside the boxes, it became necessary to  introduce locking devices which could be operated by the experimenter  from the observation bench. This was readily accomplished by cutting  holes in the floor, which permitted an iron staple, screwed to the lower  edge of each door, to project through the floor. Through these staples  by means of a lever for each of the nine boxes, the observer was able to  slide a wooden bar, placed beneath the floor of the room, thus locking  or unlocking either the entrance door, the exit door, or both, in the  case of any one of the nine boxes.    Since figure 17 is drawn to scale, it will be needless to give more than  a few of the dimensions of the apparatus. Each of the boxes was 42  inches long, 18 inches wide, and 72 inches deep, inside measurements.  The alleys D, I, and H were 24 inches, and G 30 inches wide, by 6 feet  deep. The doors of the several boxes were 18 inches wide, by 5 feet  high, while those in the alleyways were 24 inches wide by 6 feet high.  The response-compartment E of figure 17 was 14 feet 4 inches, by 8 feet,  by 6 feet in depth. In order that the apparatus might be used with adult  human subjects conveniently, if such use should prove desirable, the  depth throughout was made 6 feet, and it was therefore possible for the  experimenter to walk about erect in it.    The experimental procedure was briefly as follows: A small quantity of  food having been placed in each of the food cups and covered by the  metal flanges on the exit doors, the experimenter raised door 11 of  figure 17 and then opened door 10 and the door of the cage in which the  desired subject was confined. After the latter, in search of food, had  entered the runway D, the experimenter lowered door 11 to keep it in  this runway, and immediately proceeded to set the reaction-mechanisms  for an experiment (trial). Let us suppose that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10845"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 332, (#3)"],[1,"to a number of merry observations. This was the last  time she was alarmed in her house, and she had hopes of being at last  entirely rid of her unrelenting persecutor, when one evening, riding out  with a friend, she was once more greatly terrified. They drove through the  Chiaja, where the once-favoured Genoese had resided. The moon shone bright.  The lady with her demanded, \"Is not that the house where Mr. ---- died?\"  \"It is one of those two, if I am not mistaken,\" replied Antonelli. That  instant the report burst upon their ears louder than ever; the flash  issuing from one of the houses, seemed to pass through the carriage. The  coachman supposing they were attacked by robbers, drove off in great haste.  On arriving at the place of destination, the two ladies were taken out in  a state of insensibility.    This was, however, the last scene of terror. The invisible tormentor now  changed his manner, and used more gentle means. One evening, soon after, a  loud clapping of hands was heard under her window. Antonelli, as a  favourite actress and singer, was no stranger to these sounds; they  carried in them nothing terrifying, and they might be ascribed to one of  her admirers. She paid little attention to it; her friends, however, were  more vigilant, they sent out spies as formerly. The clapping was heard,  but no one was to be seen; and it was hoped that these mysterious doings  would soon entirely cease.    After some evenings the clapping was no longer heard, and more agreeable  sounds succeeded. They were not properly melodious, but unspeakably  delightful and agreeable; they seemed to issue from the corner of an  opposite street, approach the window, and die gently away. It seemed as if  some aerial spirit intended them as a prelude to some piece of music that  he was about to perform. These tones soon became weaker, and at last were  heard no more.    I had the curiosity, soon after the first disturbance, to go to the house  of the deceased, under the pretext of visiting the old lady who had so  faithfully attended him in his last illness. She told me her friend had an  unbounded affection for Antonelli; that he had, for some weeks previous to  his death, talked only of her, and sometimes represented her as an angel,  and then again as a devil. When his illness became serious, his only wish  was to see her before his dissolution, probably in hopes of receiving from  her some kind expression, or prevailing on her to give him some consoling;  proof of her love and attachment. Her obstinate refusal caused him the  greatest torments, and her last answer evidently hastened his end; for,  added she, he made one violent effort, and raising his head, he cried out  in despair, _\"No, it shall avail her nothing; she avoids me, but I'll  torment her, though the grave divide us!\"_ And indeed the event proved  that a man may perform his promise in spite of death itself.    _Weekly Review._           *       *       *       *       *        UGGOLINO.    MODERNIZED FROM THE \"MONK'S TALE\" IN CHAUCER.    _(For the Mirror.)_        Of Uggolino, Pisa's hapless Count,    How shall my Muse the piteous tale relate!    Near to that city, on a gentle mount,    There stands a tow'r--within its donjon grate    They lock'd him up, and, dreadful to recount,    With him three tender babes to share his fate!    But five years old the eldest of the three--    Oh! who could rob such babes of liberty!      Doom'd was the Count within that tow'r to die,    Him Pisa's vengeful bishop did oppose;    With covert speech and false aspersions sly    He stirr'd the people, till they madly rose,    And shut him in this prison strong and high;    His former slaves are now his fiercest foes.    Coarse was their food, and scantily supplied,    A prelude to the death these captives died.      And on a luckless day it thus befell--    About their surly jailer's wonted hour    To bring them food, he enter'd not their cell,    But bolted fast their prison's outer door.    This on the County's heart rang like a knell--    Hope was excluded from this grizzly tow'r.    Speechless he sat, despair forbade to rave--    This hold was now their dungeon and their grave.      His youngest babe had not seen summers three;    \"Father,\" he cried, \"why does the man delay    To bring out food? how naughty he must be;    I have not eat a morsel all this day.    Dear father, have you got some bread for me?    Oh, if you have, do give it me, I pray;    I am so hungry that I cannot sleep--    I'll kiss you, father--do not, do not weep.\"      And day by day this pining innocent    Thus to his father piteously did cry,    Till hunger had perform'd the stern intent    Of their fierce foes. \"Oh, father, I shall die!    Take me upon your lap--my life is spent--    Kiss me--farewell!\" Then with a gentle sigh,    Its spotless spirit left the suff'ring clay,    And wing'd its fright to everlasting day.      (He who has mark'd that wild, distracting mien,    Which for this Count immortal Reynold's drew,    When bitter woe, despair, and famine keen    Unite in that sad face to shock the view,    Will wish, while gazing on th' appalling scene,    For pity's sake the story is not true.    What hearts but fiends, what less than hellish hate,    Could e'er consign that group to such a fate?)      And when he saw his darling child was dead,    From statue-like despair the Count did start;    He tore his matted locks from off his head,    And bit his arms, for grief so wrung his heart.    His two surviving babes drew near and said,    (Thinking 'twas hunger's thorn which caus'd his smart,)    \"Dear sire, you gave us life, to you we give    Our little bodies--feed on them and live!\"      Like two bruis'd lilies, soon they pin'd away,    And breath'd their last upon their father's knee;    Despair and Famine bow'd him to their sway;    He died--here ends this Count's dark tragedy.    Whoso would read this tale more fully may    Consult the mighty bard of Italy;    Dante's high strain will all the sequel tell,    So courteous, friendly readers, fare ye well.    P.

H. W. P.           *       *       *       *       *        MARINE GLOW WORMS.    _(For the Mirror.)_      These extraordinary little insects are more particularly noticed in Italy,  during the period of summer, than in any other part of the world. When  they make their appearance, they glitter like stars reflected by the sea,  so beautiful and luminous are their minute bodies. Many contemplative  lovers of the phenomena of nature are seen, soon after sun-set, along the  sea coast, admiring the singular lustre of the water when covered with  these particles of life, which it may be observed, are more numerous where  the _alga marina_, or sea-weed abounds.    The marine glow-worm is composed of eleven articulations, or rings; upon  these rings, and near the belly of the insect, are placed fins, which  appear to be the chief instruments of its motion. It has two small horns  issuing from the fore part of the head, and its tail is cleft in two. To  the naked eye of man, they seem even smaller than the finest hairs; and  their substance is delicate beyond description. They first begin to make  their appearance upon the sea-weed about the middle of April, and very  soon after multiply exceedingly over the whole surface of the water.    I think it is more than probable, that the heat of the sun causes the  marine glow-worm to lay its eggs; at all events it is certain, that  terrestrial insects of this species shine only in the heat of summer, and  that their peculiar resplendency is produced during the period of their  copulation.

(_For the Mirror._)      The origin of epitaphs, and the precise period when they were first  introduced, is involved in obscurity; but that they were in use several  centuries prior to the Christian era is indisputable. The invention of  them, however, has been attributed to the scholars of Linus, who,  according to Diogenes, was the son of Mercury and Urania; he was born at  Thebes, and instructed Hercules in the art of music; who, in a fit of  anger at the ridicule of Linus, on his awkwardness in holding the lyre,  struck him on the head with his instrument, and killed him. The scholars  of Linus lamented the death of their master, in a mournful kind of poem,  called from him _Aelinum_. These poems were afterwards designated  _Epitaphia_, from the two words [Greek: epi], _upon_, and [Greek: taphios],  _sepulchre_,"]]]
