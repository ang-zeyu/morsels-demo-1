Allowing the trip to Australia to take forty days, we have 4,320 tons  of coal--say 5,000 tons for the trip. The Etruria burns about this quantity  in the run to New York and back. For each ton of coal burned in the Great  Eastern about 15,000 tons of cargo and 3,000 passengers could be moved  about 3-1/3 miles. There is, we need hardly say, nothing afloat which can  compare in economy of fuel with this. Taken on another basis, we may  compare her with an ordinary cargo boat. In such a vessel about 3,000 tons  of grain can be moved at 9 knots an hour for 600 horse power--that is 5  tons of cargo per horse power. Reducing the speed of the Great Eastern to 9  knots and about 2,000 horse power, we have 9 tons of cargo moved at 9 knots  per horse power; so that in the relation of coal burned to cargo moved she  would be nearly twice as economical as any other vessel afloat.    The important question is, What would the necessary alterations cost? Much,  of course, would depend on what was done. A very large part of the present  screw engines could be used. For example, the crank shaft, some 2 feet in  diameter, is a splendid job, and no difficulty need be met with in working  in nearly the whole of the present framing. If the engines were only to be  compound, two of the existing cylinders might be left where they are, two  high-pressure cylinders being substituted for the others. If triple  expansion were adopted, then new engines would be wanted, but the present  crank and screw shafts would answer perfectly. The present screw would have  to be removed and one of smaller diameter and less pitch put in its place.  All things considered, we believe that for about L75,000 the Great Eastern  could be entirely renovated and remodeled inside. Her owners would then  have for, say, L100,000 a ship without a rival. Her freights might be cut  so low that she would always have cargo enough, and her speed and moderate  fares ought to attract plenty of passengers. Sum up the matter how we may,  there appears to be a good case for further investigation and inquiry as to  the prospects of success for such a ship in the Australian trade, and the  opinion of merchants and others in Melbourne and Sydney ought to be  obtained. Something would be gained even if the opinions of unprejudiced  experts were adverse. We might then rest content to regard the ship as an  utter failure, and not object to see her sunk and filled with concrete to  play the part of a breakwater. Until, however, such an opinion has been  expressed after full discussion, we must continue to regard the ship as fit  for something better than a music hall and dancing saloon.--_The Engineer_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NEW GERMAN CORVETTE GREIF.      Our cut represents the corvette Greif--the latest addition to the German  fleet--on its trial trip, March 10. As other naval powers, especially  England and France, have lately built corvettes and cruisers which can  travel from 17 to 18 knots, while the fastest German boats, Blitz and  Pfeil, can make only 16 knots an hour, the chief of the Imperial Admiralty  decided to construct a corvette which should be the fastest vessel in the  world. The order was given to the ship and engine corporation \"Germania,\"  of Berlin and Keil, in April, 1885, the requirements being that the engines  should generate 5,400 h.p., and that the vessel, when loaded, should have a  speed of 19 knots, a point which has never been reached by any boat of its  size. The hull is made of the best German steel of Krupp's manufacture, and  measures 318 ft. in length at the water line, with a breadth of beam of 33  ft., the depth from keel to deck being 22 ft. It draws about 11 ft., and  has a displacement of 2,000 tons.    As the vessel is to be used principally as a dispatch boat and for  reconnoitering, and as--on account of its great speed--it will not be  obliged to come into conflict with larger and stronger men-of-war, no great  preparations for protection were needed, nor was it necessary that it  should be heavily armed, all available room being devoted to the engines,  boilers, and the storing of coal; these occupy more than half the length of  the vessel, leaving only space enough for the accommodation of the officers  and crew at the ends. The armament consists of five Hotchkiss revolving  guns on each side, and a 4 in. gun at each end, the latter being so  arranged that each one can sweep half the horizon.    The keel was laid in August, 1885, and the ship was launched July 29,  1886, on which occasion it was christened Greif. On the trial trip it was  found that the slender shape of the vessel adapted it for the development  of a very high rate of speed under favorable conditions, when it can make  at least 22 knots an hour, so that the speed of 19 knots an hour guaranteed  by the builders can certainly be reached, even when traveling at a  disadvantage. In spite of its great length, the Greif can be easily  maneuvered. When moving forward at full speed, it can be made to describe a  circle by proper manipulation of the rudder, and by turning one screw  forward and the other backward, the ship can be turned in a channel of its  own length.    [Illustration: THE NEW GERMAN WAR STEAMER GREIF.]    A large and rapid cruiser, also for the German navy, is being built by the  corporation \"Germania\". This vessel is of about the same length as the  Greif, has more than double its displacement, and will make 18 knots an  hour, an unusual rate of speed for a vessel of its class. It will be  launched by the last of the summer or early in the fall.           *       *       *       *       *          TWIN SCREW TORPEDO BOAT.      We give several illustrations of a sea going twin screw torpedo boat lately  built for the Italian government by Messrs. Yarrow & Co., of Poplar. The  vessel in question is 140 ft. long by 14 ft. wide, and her displacement  approaches close on 100 tons. The engines are of the compound surface  condensing type ordinarily fitted by this firm in their torpedo boats,  excepting where triple compounds are fitted. The general arrangement is  shown by the sectional plan. As will be noticed, there are two boilers, one  before and the other aft of the engines, and either boiler is arranged to  supply either or both the engines. Yarrow's patent water tight ash pans are  fitted to each boiler, to prevent the fire being extinguished by a sudden  influx of water into the stokehold. There is an independent centrifugal  pumping engine arranged to take its suction from any compartment of the  boat. There are also steam ejectors and hand pumps to each compartment.  These compartments are very numerous, as the space is much subdivided, both  from considerations of strength and safety. Bow and stern rudders are  fitted, each having independent steam steering gear, but both rudders can  be worked in unison, or they can be immediately changed to hand gear when  necessary. The accommodation is very good for a vessel of this class.  Officers' and petty officers' cabins are aft, while the crew is berthed  forward.    [Illustration: TWIN SCREW TORPEDO BOAT FOR THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT.]    The armament consists of two bow tubes built in the boat. There are two  turntables, as shown in the illustrations, each fitted with two torpedo  tubes. These, it will be noticed, are not arranged parallel to each other,  but lie at a small angle, so that if both torpedoes are ejected at once,  they will take a somewhat divergent course. Messrs. Yarrow have introduced  this plan in order to give a better chance for one of the torpedoes to hit  the vessel attacked. There are two quick firing three pounder guns on deck,  and there is a powerful search light, the dynamo and engine being placed in  the galley compartment.    We believe, says _Engineering_, this torpedo boat, together with a sister  vessel, built also for the Italian government, are the fastest vessels of  their class yet tried, and it is certain that the British Navy does not yet  possess a craft to equal them. It is an extraordinary and lamentable fact  that Great Britain, which claims to be the foremost naval power in the  world, has always been behind the times in the matter of torpedo boats.    The official trial of this boat was recently made in the Lower Hope in  rough weather.

I was yet undetermined when I reached the edge  of the roof.    It was a dizzy descent, but once made, escape from the yard beneath  would be easy. A man could take that road without difficulty; but a  woman! Baffled at the idea I turned thoughtfully back, when I beheld  something on the roof before me that caused me to pause and ask myself  if this was going to turn out to be a tragedy after all. It was a drop  of congealed blood. Further on towards the window was another, and  yes, further still, another and another. I even found one upon the very  window ledge itself. Bounding into the room, I searched the carpet for  further traces. It was the worst one in the world to find anything  upon of the nature of which I was seeking, being a confused pattern of  mingled drab and red, and in my difficulty I had to stoop very low.    \"What are you looking for?\" cried Mrs. Daniels.    I pointed to the drop on the window sill. \"Do you see that?\" I asked.    She uttered an exclamation and bent nearer. \"Blood!\" cried she, and  stood staring, with rapidly paling cheeks and trembling form. \"They have  killed her and he will never--\"    As she did not finish I looked up.    \"Do you think it was her blood?\" she whispered in a horrified tone.    \"There is every reason to believe so,\" rejoined I, pointing to a spot  where I had at last discovered not only one crimson drop but many,  scattered over the scarcely redder roses under my feet.    \"Ah, it is worse than I thought,\" murmured she. \"What are you going to  do? What can we do?    \"I am going to send for another detective,\" returned I; and stepping to  the window I telegraphed at once to the man Harris to go for Mr. Gryce.    \"The one we saw at the Station?\"    I bowed assent.    Her face lost something of its drawn expression. \"O I am glad; he will  do something.\"    Subduing my indignation at this back thrust, I employed my time in  taking note of such details as had escaped my previous attention. They  were not many. The open writing-desk--in which, however I found no  letters or written documents of any kind, only a few sheets of paper,  with pen, ink, etc.; the brush and hairpins scattered on the bureau as  though the girl had been interrupted while arranging her hair (if she  had been interrupted); and the absence of any great pile of work such as  one would expect to see in a room set apart for sewing, were all I could  discover. Not much to help us, in case this was to prove an affair of  importance as I began to suspect.    With Mr. Gryce's arrival, however, things soon assumed a better shape.  He came to the basement door, was ushered in by your humble servant, had  the whole matter as far as I had investigated it, at his finger-ends in  a moment, and was up-stairs and in that room before I, who am called the  quickest man in the force as you all know, could have time to determine  just what difference his presence would make to me in a pecuniary way in  event of Mrs. Daniels' promises amounting to anything. He did not remain  there long, but when he came down I saw that his interest was in no wise  lessened.    \"What kind of a looking girl was this?\" he asked, hurrying up to Mrs.  Daniels who had withdrawn into a recess in the lower hall while all this  was going on. \"Describe her to me, hair, eyes, complexion, etc.; you  know.\"    \"I--I--don't know as I can,\" she stammered reluctantly, turning very  red in the face. \"I am a poor one for noticing. I will call one of the  girls, I--\" She was gone before we realized she had not finished her  sentence.    \"Humph!\" broke from Mr. Gryce's lips as he thoughtfully took down a vase  that stood on a bracket near by and looked into it.    I did not venture a word.    When Mrs. Daniels came back she had with her a trim-looking girl of  prepossessing appearance.    \"This is Fanny,\" said she; \"she knows Emily well, being in the habit of  waiting on her at table; she will tell you what you want to hear. I  have explained to her,\" she went on, nodding towards Mr. Gryce with a  composure such as she had not before displayed; \"that you are looking  for your niece who ran away from home some time ago to go into some sort  of service.\"    \"Certainly, ma'am,\" quoth that gentleman, bowing with mock admiration  to the gas-fixture. Then carelessly shifting his glance to the  cleaning-cloth which Fanny held rather conspicuously in her hand, he  repeated the question he had already put to Mrs. Daniels.    The girl, tossing her head just a trifle, at once replied:    \"O she was good-looking enough, if that is what you mean, for them as  likes a girl with cheeks as white as this cloth was afore I rubbed the  spoons with it. As for her eyes, they was blacker than her hair, which  was the blackest I ever see. She had no flesh at all, and as for her  figure--\" Fanny glanced down on her own well developed person, and gave  a shrug inexpressibly suggestive.    \"Is this description true?\" Mr. Gryce asked, seemingly of Mrs. Daniels,  though his gaze rested with curious intentness on the girl's head which  was covered with a little cap.    \"Sufficiently so,\" returned Mrs. Daniels in a very low tone, however.  Then with a sudden display of energy, \"Emily's figure is not what  you would call plump. I have seen her--\" She broke off as if a little  startled at herself and motioned Fanny to go.    \"Wait a moment,\" interposed Mr. Gryce in his soft way. \"You said the  girl's hair and eyes were dark; were they darker than yours?\"    \"O, yes sir;\" replied the girl simpering, as she settled the ribbons on  her cap.    \"Let me see your hair.\"    She took off her cap with a smile.    \"Ha, very pretty, very pretty. And the other girls? You have other girls  I suppose?\"    \"Two, sir;\" returned Mrs. Daniels.    \"How about their complexions? Are they lighter too than Emily's?\"    \"Yes, sir; about like Fanny's.\"    Mr. Gryce spread his hand over his breast in a way that assured me of  his satisfaction, and allowed the girl to go.    \"We will now proceed to the yard,\" said he. But at that moment the door  of the front room opened and a gentleman stepped leisurely into the  hall, whom at first glance I recognized as the master of the house. He  was dressed for the street and had his hat in his hand. At the sight  we all stood silent, Mrs. Daniels flushing up to the roots of her gray  hair.    Mr. Blake is an elegant-looking man as you perhaps know; proud,  reserved, and a trifle sombre. As he turned to come towards us, the  light shining through the windows at our right, fell full upon his  face, revealing such a self-absorbed and melancholy expression, I  involuntarily drew back as if I had unwittingly intruded upon a great  man's privacy. Mr. Gryce on the contrary stepped forward.    \"Mr. Blake, I believe,\" said he, bowing in that deferential way he knows  so well how to assume.    The gentleman, startled as it evidently seemed from a reverie, looked  hastily up. Meeting Mr. Gryce's bland smile, he returned the bow, but  haughtily, and as it appeared in an abstracted way.    \"Allow me to introduce myself,\" proceeded my superior. \"I am Mr. Gryce  from the detective bureau. We were notified this morning that a girl  in your employ had disappeared from your house last night in a somewhat  strange and unusual way, and I just stepped over with my man here, to  see if the matter is of sufficient importance to inquire into. With many  apologies for the intrusion, I stand obedient to your orders.\"    With a frown expressive of annoyance, Mr. Blake glanced around and  detecting Mrs. Daniels, said: \"Did you consider the affair so serious as  that?\"    She nodded, seeming to find it difficult to speak.    He remained looking at her with an expression of some doubt. \"I can  hardly think,\" said he, \"such extreme measures were necessary; the girl  will doubtless come back, or if not--\" His shoulders gave a slight shrug  and he took out his gloves.    \"The difficulty seems to be,\" quoth Mr. Gryce eyeing those gloves with  his most intent and concentrated look, \"that the girl did not go alone,  but was helped away, or forced away, by parties who had previously  broken into your house.\"    \"That is a strange circumstance,\" remarked Mr. Blake, but still without  any appearance of interest, \"and if you are sure of what you say,  demands, perhaps, some inquiry. I would not wish to put anything in the  way of justice succoring the injured. But--\" again he gave that slight  shrug of the shoulders, indicative of doubt, if not indifference.    Mrs. Daniels trembled, and took a step forward. I thought she was  going to speak, but instead of that she drew back again in her strange  hesitating way.    Mr. Gryce did not seem to notice.    \"Perhaps sir,\" said he, \"if you will step upstairs with me to the room  occupied by this girl, I may be able to show you certain evidences which  will convince you that our errand here is not one of presumption.\"    \"I am ready to concede that without troubling myself with proof,\"  observed the master of the house with the faintest show of asperity.  \"Yet if there is anything to see of a startling nature, perhaps I had  best yield to your wishes. Whereabouts in the house is this girl's room,  Mrs. Daniels?\"    \"It is--I gave her the third story back, Mr. Blake;\" replied that woman,  nervously eyeing his face. \"It was large and light for sewing, and she  was so nice--\"    He impatiently waved his hand on which he had by this time fitted his  glove to a nicety, as if these details were an unnecessary bore to him,  and motioned her to show the way. Instantly a new feeling appeared to  seize her, that of alarm.    \"I hardly think you need trouble Mr. Blake to go up-stairs,\" she  murmured, turning towards Mr. Gryce. \"I am sure when you tell him the  curtains were torn, and the chair upset, the window open and--\"    But Mr. Gryce was already on the"]]]
