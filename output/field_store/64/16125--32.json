Such a goal existed, until our wars of unification, in the  yearnings for German unity, for the fulfilment of the Barbarossa legend.  A great danger to the healthy, continuous growth of our people seems to  me to lie in the lack of it, and the more our political position in the  world is threatened by external complications, the greater is this  danger.    Extreme tension exists between the Great Powers, notwithstanding all  peaceful prospects for the moment, and it is hardly to be assumed that  their aspirations, which conflict at so many points and are so often  pressed forward with brutal energy, will always find a pacific  settlement.    In this struggle of the most powerful nations, which employ peaceful  methods at first until the differences between them grow irreconcilable,  our German nation is beset on all sides. This is primarily a result of  our geographical position in the midst of hostile rivals, but also  because we have forced ourselves, though the last-comers, the virtual  upstarts, between the States which have earlier gained their place, and  now claim our share in the dominion of this world, after we have for  centuries been paramount only in the realm of intellect. We have thus  injured a thousand interests and roused bitter hostilities. It must be  reserved for a subsequent section to explain the political situation  thus affected, but one point can be mentioned without further  consideration: if a violent solution of existing difficulties is  adopted, if the political crisis develops into military action, the  Germans would have a dangerous situation in the midst of all the forces  brought into play against them. On the other hand, the issue of this  struggle will be decisive of Germany's whole future as State and nation.  We have the most to win or lose by such a struggle. We shall be beset by  the greatest perils, and we can only emerge victoriously from this  struggle against a world of hostile elements, and successfully carry  through a Seven Years' War for our position as a World Power, if we gain  a start on our probable enemy as _soldiers_; if the army which will  fight our battles is supported by all the material and spiritual forces  of the nation; if the resolve to conquer lives not only in our troops,  but in the entire united people which sends these troops to fight for  all their dearest possessions.    These were the considerations which induced me to regard war from the  standpoint of civilization, and to study its relation to the great  tasks of the present and the future which Providence has set before the  German people as the greatest civilized people known to history.    From this standpoint I must first of all examine the aspirations for  peace, which seem to dominate our age and threaten to poison the soul of  the German people, according to their true moral significance. I must  try to prove that war is not merely a necessary element in the life of  nations, but an indispensable factor of culture, in which a true  civilized nation finds the highest expression of strength and vitality.  I must endeavour to develop from the history of the German past in its  connection with the conditions of the present those aspects of the  question which may guide us into the unknown land of the future. The  historical past cannot be killed; it exists and works according to  inward laws, while the present, too, imposes its own drastic  obligations. No one need passively submit to the pressure of  circumstances; even States stand, like the Hercules of legend, at the  parting of the ways. They can choose the road to progress or to  decadence. \"A favoured position in the world will only become effective  in the life of nations by the conscious human endeavour to use it.\" It  seemed to me, therefore, to be necessary and profitable, at this parting  of the ways of our development where we now stand, to throw what light I  may on the different paths which are open to our people. A nation must  fully realize the probable consequences of its action; then only can it  take deliberately the great decisions for its future development, and,  looking forward to its destiny with clear gaze, be prepared for any  sacrifices which the present or future may demand.    These sacrifices, so far as they lie within the military and financial  sphere, depend mainly on the idea of what Germany is called upon to  strive for and attain in the present and the future. Only those who  share my conception of the duties and obligations of the German people,  and my conviction that they cannot be fulfilled without drawing the  sword, will be able to estimate correctly my arguments and conclusions  in the purely military sphere, and to judge competently the financial  demands which spring out of it. It is only in their logical connection  with the entire development, political and moral, of the State that the  military requirements find their motive and their justification.          CHAPTER I        THE RIGHT TO MAKE WAR    Since 1795, when Immanuel Kant published in his old age his treatise on  \"Perpetual Peace,\" many have considered it an established fact that war  is the destruction of all good and the origin of all evil. In spite of  all that history teaches, no conviction is felt that the struggle  between nations is inevitable, and the growth of civilization is  credited with a power to which war must yield. But, undisturbed by such  human theories and the change of times, war has again and again marched  from country to country with the clash of arms, and has proved its  destructive as well as creative and purifying power. It has not  succeeded in teaching mankind what its real nature is. Long periods of  war, far from convincing men of the necessity of war, have, on the  contrary, always revived the wish to exclude war, where possible, from  the political intercourse of nations.    This wish and this hope are widely disseminated even to-day. The  maintenance of peace is lauded as the only goal at which statesmanship  should aim. This unqualified desire for peace has obtained in our days a  quite peculiar power over men's spirits. This aspiration finds its  public expression in peace leagues and peace congresses; the Press of  every country and of every party opens its columns to it. The current in  this direction is, indeed, so strong that the majority of Governments  profess--outwardly, at any rate--that the necessity of maintaining peace  is the real aim of their policy; while when a war breaks out the  aggressor is universally stigmatized, and all Governments exert  themselves, partly in reality, partly in pretence, to extinguish the  conflagration.    Pacific ideals, to be sure, are seldom the real motive of their action.  They usually employ the need of peace as a cloak under which to promote  their own political aims. This was the real position of affairs at the  Hague Congresses, and this is also the meaning of the action of the  United States of America, who in recent times have earnestly tried to  conclude treaties for the establishment of Arbitration Courts, first and  foremost with England, but also with Japan, France, and Germany. No  practical results, it must be said, have so far been achieved.    We can hardly assume that a real love of peace prompts these efforts.  This is shown by the fact that precisely those Powers which, as the  weaker, are exposed to aggression, and therefore were in the greatest  need of international protection, have been completely passed over in  the American proposals for Arbitration Courts. It must consequently be  assumed that very matter-of-fact political motives led the Americans,  with their commercial instincts, to take such steps, and induced  \"perfidious Albion\" to accede to the proposals. We may suppose that  England intended to protect her rear in event of a war with Germany, but  that America wished to have a free hand in order to follow her policy of  sovereignty in Central America without hindrance, and to carry out her  plans regarding the Panama Canal in the exclusive interests of America.  Both countries certainly entertained the hope of gaining advantage over  the other signatory of the treaty, and of winning the lion's share for  themselves. Theorists and fanatics imagine that they see in the efforts  of President Taft a great step forward on the path to perpetual peace,  and enthusiastically agree with him. Even the Minister for Foreign  Affairs in England, with well-affected idealism, termed the procedure of  the United States an era in the history of mankind.    This desire for peace has rendered most civilized nations anemic, and  marks a decay of spirit and political courage such as has often been  shown by a race of Epigoni. \"It has always been,\" H. von Treitschke  tells us, \"the weary, spiritless, and exhausted ages which have played  with the dream of perpetual peace.\"    Everyone will, within certain limits, admit that the endeavours to  diminish the dangers of war and to mitigate the sufferings which war  entails are justifiable. It is an incontestable fact that war  temporarily disturbs industrial life, interrupts quiet economic  development, brings widespread misery with it, and emphasizes the  primitive brutality of man. It is therefore a most desirable  consummation if wars for trivial reasons should be rendered impossible,  and if efforts are made to restrict the evils which follow necessarily  in the train of war, so far as is compatible with the essential nature  of war. All that the Hague Peace Congress has accomplished in this  limited sphere deserves, like every permissible humanization of war,  universal acknowledgment. But it is quite another matter if the object  is to abolish war entirely, and to deny its necessary place in  historical development.    This aspiration is directly antagonistic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11365"],[0,"The Fern Lover's Companion (#3)"],[1," at different times from May to September. A good  time to collect ferns is just before the fruiting season. (For times of  fruiting see individual descriptions or chronological chart on page 220.)      HELPFUL HINTS    The following hints may be helpful to the young collector:    1. A good lens with needles for dissecting is very helpful in examining the  sori, veins, glands, etc., as an accurate knowledge of any one of these  items may aid in identifying a given specimen. Bausch and Lomb make a  convenient two-bladed pocket glass for about two dollars.[1]    [Footnote 1: In the linen tester here figured (cost $1.50) the lens is  mounted in a brass frame which holds it in position, enabling the dissector  to use both hands. A tripod lens will also be found cheap and serviceable.]    [Illustration]    2. Do not exterminate or weaken a fern colony by taking more plants than it  can spare. In small colonies of rare ferns take a few and leave the rest to  grow. It is decidedly ill-bred to rob a locality of its precious plants.  Pick your fern leaf down close to the root-stock, including a portion of  that also, if it can be spared. Place your fronds between newspaper sheets  and lay \"dryers\" over them (blotting paper or other absorbent paper). Cover  with a board or slat frame, and lay on this a weight of several pounds,  leaving it for twenty-four hours; if the specimens are not then cured,  change the dryers. Mount the prepared specimens on white mounting sheets.  The regulation size is 16-1/2 by 11-1/2 inches. The labels are usually  3-3/4 by 1-3/4 inches. A sample will suggest the proper inscription.      HERBARIUM OF JOHN DOE    _Ophioglossum vulgatum_, L.    (Adder's Tongue)    Willoughby Lake, Vt.    August 19, 1911. Wet meadow.    Coll. X.Y.Z. Rather common    but often overlooked    Place the label at the lower right-hand corner of the sheet, which is now  ready to be laid in the genus cover, usually of manila paper 16-1/2 by 12  inches.    It is well to jot down important memoranda at the time of collecting. This  is the method in use at the Gray Herbarium in Cambridge. It can, of course,  be modified to suit one's own taste or convenience. The young collector can  begin by simply pressing his specimens between the leaves of a book,  the older and coarser the better; and he can mount them in a blank book  designed for the purpose, or if he has only a common blank book, he can cut  out some of the leaves, alternately with others left in place, as is often  done with a scrap book, that when the book is full it may not be crowded at  the back. Or he can use sheets of blank paper of any uniform size and mount  the specimens on these with gummed strips, and then group them, placing  those of the same genus together. Such an extemporized herbarium, though  crude, will serve for a beginning, while stimulating his interest, and  advancing his knowledge of the ferns. Let him collect, press, and mount  as many varieties as possible, giving the name with date and place of  collecting, etc. Such a first attempt may be kept as a reminder of pleasant  hours spent in learning the rudiments of a delightful study.    We cannot insist too strongly upon the necessity of handling and studying  the living plant. Every student needs to observe for himself the haunts,  habits, and structure of real ferns. We would say to the young student,  while familiarizing yourself with the English names of the ferns, do not  neglect the scientific names, which often hold the key to their meaning.  Repeat over and over the name of each genus in soliloquy and in  conversation until your mind instantly associates each fern with its family  name--\"_Adiantum_,\" \"_Polystichum_,\" \"_Asplenium_,\" and all the rest. Fix  them in the memory for a permanent asset. With hard study and growing  knowledge will come growing attachment. How our great expert, Mr.  Davenport, loved the ferns! He would handle them with gentle touch, fondly  stroke their leaves, and devoutly study their structure, as if inspired by  the All-wise Interpreter.      \"Move along these shades    In gentleness of heart: with gentle hand    Touch--for there is a spirit in the woods.\"          KEY TO THE GENERA      This key, in illustrating each genus, follows the method of Clute in \"Our  Ferns in Their Haunts,\" but substitutes other and larger specimens. Five of  these are from Waters' \"Ferns\" by permission of Henry Holt & Co.    As the indusium, which often determines the name of a fern, is apt in some  species to wither early, it is important to secure for study not only a  fertile frond, but one in as good condition as possible. For convenience  the ferns may be considered in two classes.      I    THOSE WHICH HAVE THE FRUITING PORTION IN GREENISH, BERRY-LIKE STRUCTURES  AND NOT ON THE BACK OF FRONDS      A.
