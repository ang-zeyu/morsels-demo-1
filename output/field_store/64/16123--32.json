E.L.I.           *       *       *       *       *      THE ORIGIN OF PETER'S PENCE.    (_For The Mirror._)      The custom of paying \"Peter's pence\" is of Saxon origin; and they  continued to be paid by the inhabitants of England, till the abolition  of the Papal power. The event by which their payment was enacted is as  follows:--Ethelbert, king of the east angles, having reigned single some  time, thought fit to take a wife; for this purpose he came to the court  of Offa, king of Mercia, to desire his daughter in marriage. Queenrid,  consort of Offa, a cruel, ambitious, and blood-thirsty woman, who envied  the retinue and splendour of the unsuspicious king, resolved in some  manner to have him murdered, before he left their court, hoping by that  to gain his immense riches; for this purpose she, with her malicious and  fascinating arts, overcame the king--her husband, which she most  cunningly effected, and, under deep disguises, laid open to him her  portentous design; a villain was therefore hired, named Gimberd, who was  to murder the innocent prince. The manner in which the heinous crime was  effected was as cowardly as it was fatal: under the chair of state in  which Ethelbert sat, a deep pit was dug; at the bottom of it was placed  the murderer; the unfortunate king was then let through a trap-door into  the pit; his fear overcame him so much, that he did not attempt  resistance. Three months after this, Queenrid died, when circumstances  convinced Offa of the innocence of Ethelbert; he therefore, to appease  his guilt, built St. Alban's monastery, gave one-tenth part of his goods  to the poor, and went in penance to Rome--where he gave to the Pope a  penny for every house in his dominions, which were afterwards called  _Rome shot_, or _Peter's pence_, and given by the inhabitants of  England, &c. till 1533, when Henry VIII. shook off the authority of the  Pope in this country.    T.C.           *       *       *       *       *        ARCANA OF SCIENCE.      _Black And White Swans._    A few weeks since a _black swan_ was killed by his white companions, in  the neighbourhood of London. Of this extraordinary circumstance, an  eye-witness gives the following account:--    I was walking, between four and five o'clock on Saturday afternoon, in  the Regent's Park, when my attention was attracted by an unusual noise  on the water, which I soon ascertained to arise from a furious attack  made by two white swans on the solitary black one. The _allied_ couple  pursued with the greatest ferocity the unfortunate _rara avis_, and one  of them succeeded in getting the neck of his enemy between his bill, and  shaking it violently. The poor black with difficulty extricated himself  from this murderous grasp, hurried on shore, tottered a few paces from  the water's edge, and fell. His death appeared to be attended with great  agony, stretching his neck in the air, fluttering his wings, and  attempting to rise from the ground. At length, after about five minutes  of suffering, he made a last effort to rise, and fell with outstretched  neck and wings. One of the keepers came up at the moment, and found the  poor bird dead. It is remarkable, that his foes never left the water in  pursuit, but continued sailing up and down to the spot wherein their  victim fell, with every feather on end, and apparently proud of their  conquest.    _Fascination Of Snakes._    I have often heard stories about the power that snakes have to charm  birds and animals, which, to say the least, I always treated with the  coldness of scepticism, nor could I believe them until convinced by  ocular demonstration. A case occurred in Williamsburgh, Massachussets,  one mile south of the house of public worship, by the way-side, in July  last. As I was walking in the road at noon-day, my attention was drawn  to the fence by the fluttering and hopping of a robin red-breast, and a  cat-bird, which, upon my approach, flew up, and perched on a sapling two  or three rods distant; at this instant a large black snake reared his  head from the ground near the fence. I immediately stepped back a  little, and sat down upon an eminence; the snake in a few moments slunk  again to the earth, with a calm, placid appearance; and the birds soon  after returned, and lighted upon the ground near the snake, first  stretching their wings upon the ground, and spreading their tails, they  commenced fluttering round the snake, drawing nearer at almost every  step, until they stepped near or across the snake, which would often  move a little, or throw himself into a different posture, apparently to  seize his prey; which movements, I noticed, seemed to frighten the  birds, and they would veer off a few feet, but return again as soon as  the snake was motionless. All that was wanting for the snake to secure  the victims seemed to be, that the birds should pass near his head,  which they would probably have soon done, but at this moment a wagon  drove up and stopped. This frightened the snake, and it crawled across  the fence into the grass: notwithstanding, the birds flew over the fence  into the grass also, and appeared to be bewitched, to flutter around  their charmer, and it was not until an attempt was made to kill the  snake that the birds would avail themselves of their wings, and fly into  a forest one hundred rods distant. The movements of the birds while  around the snake seemed to be voluntary, and without the least  constraint; nor did they utter any distressing cries, or appear enraged,  as I have often seen them when squirrels, hawks, and mischievous boys  attempted to rob their nests, or catch their young ones; but they seemed  to be drawn by some allurement or enticement, and not by any  constraining or provoking power; indeed, I thoroughly searched all the  fences and trees in the vicinity, to find some nest or young birds, but  could find none. What this fascinating power is, whether it be the look  or effluvium, or the singing by the vibration of the tail of the snake,  or anything else, I will not attempt to determine--possibly this power  may be owing to different causes in different kinds of snakes. But so  far as the black snake is concerned, _it seems to be nothing more than  an enticement or allurement with which the snake is endowed to procure  his fowl_.--_Professor Silliman's Journal_.    _Boring Marine Animals._    The most destructive of these is the _Teredo Navalis_, a fine specimen  of which was exhibited at a recent meeting of the Portsmouth  Philosophical Society. This animal has been said to extend the whole  length of the boring tube; but this assertion is erroneous, since the  tubes are formed by a secretion from the body of the animal, and are  often many feet in length, and circuitous in their course. This was  shown to be the fact, by a large piece of wood pierced in all  directions. The manner in which it affects its passage, and the interior  of the tubes, were also described. The assertion that the _Teredo_ does  not attack teak timber was disproved; and its destructive ravages on the  bottom of ships exemplified, by a relation of the providential escape of  his majesty's ship Sceptre, which having lost some copper from off her  bows, the timbers were pierced through to such an extent as to render  her incapable of pursuing her voyage without repair.    _Anthracite, or Stone Coal._    Professor Silliman's last journal contains a very important article,  illustrative of the practical application of this mineral; and the vast  quantities of it that may be found in Great Britain renders the  information highly valuable to our manufacturing interests. In no part  of the world is anthracite, so valuable in the arts and for economical  purposes, found so abundantly as in Pennsylvania. For the manufacture of  iron this fuel is peculiarly advantageous, as it embraces little sulphur  or other injurious ingredients; produces an intense steady heat; and,  for most operations, it is equal, if not superior to coke. Bar iron,  anchors, chains, steamboat machinery, and wrought-iron of every  description, has more tenacity and malleability, with less waste of  metal, when fabricated by anthracite, than by the aid of bituminous coal  or charcoal, with a diminution of fifty per cent. in the expense of  labour and fuel. For breweries, distilleries, and the raising of steam,  anthracite coal is decidedly preferable to other fuel, the heat being  more steady and manageable, and the boilers less corroded by sulphureous  acid, while no bad effects are produced by smoke and bitumen. The  anthracite of Pennsylvania is located between the Blue Bridge and  Susquehannah; and has not hitherto been found in other parts of the  state, except in the valley of Wyoming.    _Holly Hedges._    At Tynningham, the residence of the Earl of Harrington, are holly hedges  extending 2,952 yards, in some cases 13 feet broad and 25 feet high. The  age of these hedges is something more than a century. At the same place  are individual trees of a size quite unknown in these southern  districts.

My experiments were successful, and we  now prepare an enamel argentic paper on which the prints stand out with  brilliancy equal to those on albumenized paper. I here show you  specimens of boudoirs and panels--pictures enlarged from  C.D.V.--negatives on this enamel argentic.    [Mr. Goodall then passed round several enlargements from landscape and  portrait negatives, which it would have been difficult to distinguish  from prints on double albumenized paper.]    I have already spoken of the great ease and facility with which an  argentic enlargement may be made as compared with a collodion transfer,  for instance; but there is another and more important point to be  considered between the two, and that is, their durability and  permanence. Now with regard to a collodion transfer, unless most  particular care be taken in the washing of it (and those who have made  them will well know what a delicate, not to say difficult, job it is to  get them thoroughly freed from the hypo, and at the same time preserve  the film intact), there is no permanence in a collodion transfer, and  that practically in nine cases out of ten they have the elements of  decay in them from the first day of their existence. I know, at least in  Glasgow, where an enormous business has been done within the last few  years by certain firms in the club picture trade (the club picture being  a collodion transfer tinted in oil or varnish colors), there are  literally thousands of pictures for which thirty shillings or more has  been paid, and of which the bare frame is all that remains at the  present day; the gilt of the frames has vanished, and the picture in  disgust, perhaps, has followed it. In short, I believe a collodion  transfer cannot be made even comparatively permanent, unless an amount  of care be taken in the making of it which is neither compatible nor  consistent with the popular price and extensive output. How now stands  the case with an argentic enlargement? Of course it may be said that  there is scarcely time yet to make a fair comparison--that the argentic  enlargements are still only on their trial.    I will give you my own experience. I mentioned at the outset that seven  or eight years ago I had tried Kennet's pellicle and failed, but got one  or two results which I retained as curiosities till only a month or two  ago; but up to that time I cannot say they had faded in the least, and I  have here a specimen made three years ago, which I have purposely  subjected to very severe treatment. It has been exposed without any  protection to the light and damp and all the other noxious influences of  a Glasgow atmosphere, and although certainly tarnished, I think you will  find that it has not faded; the whites are dirty, but the blacks have  lost nothing of their original strength. I here show you the picture  referred to, a 12 by 10 enlargement on artist's canvas, and may here  state, in short, that my whole experience of argentic enlargements leads  me to the conclusion that, setting aside every other quality, they are  the most permanent pictures that have ever been produced. Chromotypes  and other carbon pictures have been called permanent, but their  permanence depends upon the nature of the pigment employed, and  associated with the chromated gelatine in which they are produced, most  of pigments used, and all of the prettiest ones, being unable to  withstand the bleaching action of the light for more than a few weeks.  Carbon pictures are therefore only permanent according to the degree in  which the coloring matter employed is capable of resisting the  decolorizing action of light. But there is no pigment in an argentic  print, nothing but the silver reduced by the developer after the action  of light; and that has been shown by, I think, Captain Abney, to be of a  very stable and not easily decomposed nature; while if the pictures are  passed through a solution of alum after washing and fixing, the gelatine  also is so acted upon as to be rendered in a great degree impervious to  the action of damp, and the pictures are then somewhat similar to carbon  pictures without carbon.    I may now say a few words on the defects and failures sometimes met with  in working this process; and first in regard to the yellowing of the  whites. I hear frequent complaints of this want of purity in the whites,  especially in vignetted enlargements, and I believe that this almost  always arises from one or other of the two following causes:    First. An excess of the ferrous salt in the ferrous oxalate developer;  and when this is the case, the yellow compound salt is more in  suspension than solution, and in the course of development it is  deposited upon, and at the same time formed in, the gelatinous film.    The proportions of saturated solution of oxalate to saturated solution  of iron, to form the oxalate of iron developer, that has been  recommended by the highest and almost only scientific authority on the  subject--Dr. Eder--are from 4 to 6 parts of potassic oxalate to 1 part  of ferrous sulphate.    Now while these proportions may be the best for the development of a  negative, they are not, according to my experience, the best for  gelatine bromide positive enlargements; I find, indeed, that potassic  oxalate should not have more than one-eighth of the ferrous sulphate  solution added to it, otherwise it will not hold in proper solution for  any length of time the compound salt formed when the two are mixed.    The other cause is the fixing bath. This, for opals and vignetted  enlargements especially, should always be fresh and pretty strong, so  that the picture will clear rapidly before any deposit has time to take  place, as it will be observed that very shortly after even one iron  developed print has been fixed in it a deposit of some kind begins to  take place, so that although it may be used a number of times for fixing  prints that are meant to be colored afterward it is best to take a small  quantity of fresh hypo for every enlargement meant to be finished in  black and white. The proportions I use are 8 ounces to the pint of  water. Almost the only other complaints I now hear are traceable to  over-exposure or lack of intelligent cleanliness in the handling of the  paper. The operator, after having been dabbling for some time in hypo,  or pyro, or silver solution, gives his hands a wipe on the focusing  cloth, and straightway sets about making an enlargement, ending up by  blessing the manufacturer who sent him paper full of black stains and  smears. Argentic paper is capable of yielding excellent enlargements,  but it must be intelligently exposed, intelligently developed, and  cleanly and carefully handled.           *       *       *       *       *          THE MANUFACTURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PHOTOGRAPHIC LENSES.      At a recent meeting of the London and Provincial Photographic  Association Mr. J. Traill Taylor, formerly of New York, commenced his  lecture by referring to the functions of lenses, and by describing the  method by which the necessary curves were computed in order to obtain a  definite focal length. The varieties of optical glass were next  discussed, and specimens (both in the rough and partly shaped state)  were handed round for examination. The defects frequently met with in  glass, such as striae and tears, were then treated upon; specimens of  lenses defective from this cause were submitted to inspection, and the  mode of searching for such flaws described. Tools for grinding and  polishing lenses of various curvatures were exhibited, together with a  collection of glass disks obtained from the factory of Messrs. Ross &  Co., and in various stages of manufacture--from the first rough slab to  the surface of highest polish. Details of polishing and edging were gone  into, and a series of the various grades of emery used in the processes  was shown. The lecturer then, by means of diagrams which he placed upon  the blackboard, showed the forms of various makes of photographic  lenses, and explained the influence of particular constructions in  producing certain results; positive and negative spherical aberration,  and the manner in which they are made to balance each other, was also  described by the aid of diagrams, as was also chromatic aberration. He  next spoke of the question of optical center of lenses, and said that  that was not, as had been hitherto generally supposed, the true place  from which to measure the focus of a lens or combination. This place was  a point very near the optical center, and was known as the \"Gauss\"  point, from the name of the eminent German mathematician who had  investigated and made known its properties, the knowledge of which was  of the greatest importance in the construction of lenses. A diagram was  drawn to show the manner of ascertaining the two Gauss points of a  bi-convex lens, and a sheet exhibited in which the various kinds of  lenses with their optical centers and Gauss points were shown. For this  drawing he (Mr. Taylor) said he was indebted to Dr. Hugo Schroeder, now  with the firm of Ross & Co. The lecturer congratulated the  newly-proposed member of the Society, Mr. John Stuart, for his  enterprise in securing for this country a man of such profound  acquirements. The subject of distortion was next treated of, and the  manner in which the idea of a non distorting doublet could be evolved  from a single bi-convex lens by division into two plano-convex lenses  with a central diaphragm was shown.
