We came here and settled  ourselves. I undertook the domestic part of the menage, you the  out-of-doors and the general control. My own principle has been to meet  your wishes in everything, to live only for you. At least, let us give  ourselves a fair trial how far in this way we can be enough for each  other.\"    \"Since the interdependence of things, as you call it, is your especial  element,\" replied Edward, \"one should either never listen to any of your  trains of reasoning, or make up one's mind to allow you to be in the  right; and, indeed, you have been in the right up to the present day.  The foundation which we have hitherto been laying for ourselves, is of  the true, sound sort; only, are we to build nothing upon it? is nothing  to be developed out of it? All the work we have done--I in the garden,  you in the park--is it all only for a pair of hermits?\"    \"Well, well,\" replied Charlotte, \"very well. What we have to look to is,  that we introduce no alien element, nothing which shall cross or  obstruct us. Remember, our plans, even those which only concern our  amusements, depend mainly on our being together. You were to read to me,  in consecutive order, the journal which you made when you were abroad.  You were to take the opportunity of arranging it, putting all the loose  matter connected with it in its place; and with me to work with you and  help you, out of these invaluable but chaotic leaves and sheets to put  together a complete thing, which should give pleasure to ourselves and  to others. I promised to assist you in transcribing; and we thought it  would be so pleasant, so delightful, so charming, to travel over in  recollection the world which we were unable to see together. The  beginning is already made. Then, in the evenings, you have taken up your  flute again, accompanying me on the piano, while of visits backwards and  forwards among the neighborhood, there is abundance. For my part, I  have been promising myself out of all this the first really happy summer  I have ever thought to spend in my life.\"    \"Only I cannot see,\" replied Edward, rubbing his forehead, \"how, through  every bit of this which you have been so sweetly and so sensibly laying  before me, the Captain's presence can be any interruption; I should  rather have thought it would give it all fresh zest and life. He was my  companion during a part of my travels. He made many observations from a  different point of view from mine. We can put it all together, and so  make a charmingly complete work of it.\"    \"Well, then, I will acknowledge openly,\" answered Charlotte, with some  impatience, \"my feeling is against this plan. I have an instinct which  tells me no good will come of it.\"    \"You women are invincible in this way,\" replied Edward. \"You are so  sensible, that there is no answering you, then so affectionate, that one  is glad to give way to you; full of feelings, which one cannot wound,  and full of forebodings, which terrify one.\"    \"I am not superstitious,\" said Charlotte; \"and I care nothing for these  dim sensations, merely as such; but in general they are the result of  unconscious recollections of happy or unhappy consequences, which we  have experienced as following on our own or others' actions. Nothing is  of greater moment, in any state of things, than the intervention of a  third person. I have seen friends, brothers and sisters, lovers,  husbands and wives, whose relation to each other, through the accidental  or intentional introduction of a third person, has been altogether  changed--whose whole moral condition has been inverted by it.\"    \"That may very well be,\" replied Edward, \"with people who live on  without looking where they are going; but not, surely, with persons whom  experience has taught to understand themselves.\"    \"That understanding ourselves, my dearest husband,\" insisted Charlotte,  \"is no such certain weapon. It is very often a most dangerous one for  the person who bears it. And out of all this, at least so much seems to  arise, that we should not be in too great a hurry. Let me have a few  days to think; don't decide.\"    \"As the matter stands,\" returned Edward, \"wait as many days as we will,  we shall still be in too great a hurry. The arguments for and against  are all before us; all we want is the conclusion, and as things are, I  think the best thing we can do is to draw lots.\"    \"I know,\" said Charlotte, \"that in doubtful cases it is your way to  leave them to chance. To me, in such a serious matter, this seems almost  a crime.\"    \"Then what am I to write to the Captain?\" cried Edward; \"for write I  must at once.\"    \"Write him a kind, sensible, sympathizing letter,\" answered Charlotte.    \"That is as good as none at all,\" replied Edward.    \"And there are many cases,\" answered she, \"in which we are obliged, and  in which it is the real kindness, rather to write nothing than not to  write.\"          CHAPTER II      Edward was alone in his room. The repetition of the incidents of his  life from Charlotte's lips; the representation of their mutual  situation, their mutual purposes, had worked him, sensitive as he was,  into a very pleasant state of mind. While close to her--while in her  presence--he had felt so happy, that he had thought out a warm, kind,  but quiet and indefinite epistle which he would send to the Captain.  When, however, he had settled himself at his writing-table, and taken up  his friend's letter to read it over once more, the sad condition of this  excellent man rose again vividly before him. The feelings which had been  all day distressing him again awoke, and it appeared impossible to him  to leave one whom he called his friend in such painful embarrassment.    Edward was unaccustomed to deny himself anything. The only child, and  consequently the spoilt child, of wealthy parents, who had persuaded him  into a singular, but highly advantageous marriage with a lady far older  than himself; and again by her petted and indulged in every possible  way, she seeking to reward his kindness to her by the utmost liberality;  after her early death his own master, traveling independently of every  one, equal to all contingencies and all changes, with desires never  excessive, but multiple and various--free-hearted, generous, brave, at  times even noble--what was there in the world to cross or thwart him?    Hitherto, everything had gone as he desired! Charlotte had become his;  he had won her at last, with an obstinate, a romantic fidelity; and now  he felt himself, for the first time, contradicted, crossed in his  wishes, when those wishes were to invite to his home the friend of his  youth--just as he was longing, as it were, to throw open his whole heart  to him. He felt annoyed, impatient; he took up his pen again and again,  and as often threw it down again, because he could not make up his mind  what to write. Against his wife's wishes he would not go; against her  expressed desire he could not. Ill at ease as he was, it would have been  impossible for him, even if he had wished, to write a quiet, easy  letter. The most natural thing to do, was to put it off. In a few words,  he begged his friend to forgive him for having left his letter  unanswered; that day he was unable to write circumstantially; but  shortly, he hoped to be able to tell him what he felt at greater length.    The next day, as they were walking to the same spot, Charlotte took the  opportunity of bringing back the conversation to the subject, perhaps  because she knew that there is no surer way of rooting out any plan or  purpose than by often talking it over.    It was what Edward was wishing. He expressed him self in his own way,  kindly and sweetly. For although, sensitive as, he was, he flamed up  readily--although the vehemence with which he desired anything made him  pressing, and his obstinacy made him impatient--his words were so  softened by his wish to spare the feelings of those to whom he was  speaking, that it was impossible not to be charmed, even when one most  disagreed, with him.    This morning, he first contrived to bring Charlotte into the happiest  humor, and then so disarmed her with the graceful turn which he gave to  the conversation, that she cried out at last:    \"You are determined that what I refused to the husband you will make me  grant to the lover. At least, my dearest,\" she continued, \"I will  acknowledge that your wishes,--and the warmth and sweetness with which  you express them, have not left me untouched, have not left me unmoved.  You drive me to make a confession;--till now, I too have had a  concealment from you; I am in exactly the same position with you, and I  have hitherto been putting the same restraint on my inclination which I  have been exhorting you to put on yours.\"    \"Glad am I to hear that,\" said Edward. \"In the married state, a  difference of opinion now and then, I see, is no bad thing; we learn  something of each other by it.\"    \"You are to learn at present, then,\" said Charlotte, \"that it is with me  about Ottilie as it is with you about the Captain. The dear child is  most uncomfortable at the school, and I am thoroughly uneasy about her.  Luciana, my daughter, born as she is for the world, is there training  hourly for the world; languages, history, everything that is taught  there, she acquires with so much ease that, as it were, she learns them  off at sight. She has quick natural gifts, and an excellent memory; one  may almost say she forgets everything, and in a moment calls it all back  again. She distinguishes herself above every one at the school with the  freedom of her carriage, the grace of her movement, and the elegance of  her address, and with the inborn royalty of nature makes herself the  queen of the little circle there. The superior of the establishment  regards her as a little divinity, who, under her hands, is shaping into  excellence, and who "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11367"],[0,"A History of China (#3)"],[1,"the world originated in any such way. As time went on,  Chinese historians found more and more to say about primeval times. All  these narratives were collected in the great imperial history that  appeared at the beginning of the Manchu epoch. That book was translated  into French, and all the works written in Western languages until recent  years on Chinese history and civilization have been based in the last  resort on that translation.    Modern research has not only demonstrated that all these accounts are  inventions of a much later period, but has also shown _why_ such  narratives were composed. The older historical sources make no mention  of any rulers before 2200 B.C., no mention even of their names. The  names of earlier rulers first appear in documents of about 400 B.C.; the  deeds attributed to them and the dates assigned to them often do not  appear until much later. Secondly, it was shown that the traditional  chronology is wrong and another must be adopted, reducing all the dates  for the more ancient history, before 900 B.C. Finally, all narratives  and reports from China's earliest period have been dealt a mortal blow  by modern archaeology, with the excavations of recent years. There was  no trace of any high civilization in the third millennium B.C., and,  indeed, we can only speak of a real \"Chinese civilization\" from 1300  B.C. onward. The peoples of the China of that time had come from the  most varied sources; from 1300 B.C. they underwent a common process of  development that welded them into a new unity. In this sense and  emphasizing the cultural aspects, we are justified in using from then on  a new name, \"Chinese\", for the peoples of China. Those sections,  however, of their ancestral populations who played no part in the  subsequent cultural and racial fusion, we may fairly call \"non-Chinese\".  This distinction answers the question that continually crops up, whether  the Chinese are \"autochthonons\". They are autochthonons in the sense  that they formed a unit in the Far East, in the geographical region of  the present China, and were not immigrants from the Middle East.    2 _The Peking Man_    Man makes his appearance in the Far East at a time when remains in other  parts of the world are very rare and are disputed. He appears as the  so-called \"Peking Man\", whose bones were found in caves of  Chou-k'ou-tien south of Peking. The Peking Man is vastly different from  the men of today, and forms a special branch of the human race, closely  allied to the Pithecanthropus of Java. The formation of later races of  mankind from these types has not yet been traced, if it occurred at all.  Some anthropologists consider, however, that the Peking Man possessed  already certain characteristics peculiar to the yellow race.    The Peking Man lived in caves; no doubt he was a hunter, already in  possession of very simple stone implements and also of the art of making  fire. As none of the skeletons so far found are complete, it is assumed  that he buried certain bones of the dead in different places from the  rest. This burial custom, which is found among primitive peoples in  other parts of the world, suggests the conclusion that the Peking Man  already had religious notions. We have no knowledge yet of the length of  time the Peking Man may have inhabited the Far East. His first traces  are attributed to a million years ago, and he may have flourished in  500,000 B.C.    3 _The Palaeolithic Age_    After the period of the Peking Man there comes a great gap in our  knowledge. All that we know indicates that at the time of the Peking Man  there must have been a warmer and especially a damper climate in North  China and Inner Mongolia than today. Great areas of the Ordos region,  now dry steppe, were traversed in that epoch by small rivers and lakes  beside which men could live. There were elephants, rhinoceroses, extinct  species of stag and bull, even tapirs and other wild animals. About  50,000 B.C. there lived by these lakes a hunting people whose stone  implements (and a few of bone) have been found in many places. The  implements are comparable in type with the palaeolithic implements of  Europe (Mousterian type, and more rarely Aurignacian or even  Magdalenian). They are not, however, exactly like the European  implements, but have a character of their own. We do not yet know what  the men of these communities looked like, because as yet no indisputable  human remains have been found. All the stone implements have been found  on the surface, where they have been brought to light by the wind as it  swept away the loess. These stone-age communities seem to have lasted a  considerable time and to have been spread not only over North China but  over Mongolia and Manchuria. It must not be assumed that the stone age  came to an end at the same time everywhere. Historical accounts have  recorded, for instance, that stone implements were still in use in  Manchuria and eastern Mongolia at a time when metal was known and used  in western Mongolia and northern China. Our knowledge about the  palaeolithic period of Central and South China is still extremely  limited; we have to wait for more excavations before anything can be  said. Certainly, many implements in this area were made of wood or more  probably bamboo, such as we still find among the non-Chinese tribes of  the south-west and of South-East Asia. Such implements, naturally, could  not last until today.    About 25,000 B.C. there appears in North China a new human type, found  in upper layers in the same caves that sheltered Peking Man. This type  is beyond doubt not Mongoloid, and may have been allied to the Ainu, a  non-Mongol race still living in northern Japan. These, too, were a  palaeolithic people, though some of their implements show technical  advance. Later they disappear, probably because they were absorbed into  various populations of central and northern Asia. Remains of them have  been found in badly explored graves in northern Korea.    4 _The Neolithic age_    In the period that now followed, northern China must have gradually  become arid, and the formation of loess seems to have steadily advanced.  There is once more a great gap in our knowledge until, about 4000 B.C.,  we can trace in North China a purely Mongoloid people with a neolithic  culture. In place of hunters we find cattle breeders, who are even to  some extent agriculturists as well. This may seem an astonishing  statement for so early an age. It is a fact, however, that pure pastoral  nomadism is exceptional, that normal pastoral nomads have always added a  little farming to their cattle-breeding, in order to secure the needed  additional food and above all fodder, for the winter.    At this time, about 4000 B.C., the other parts of China come into view.  The neolithic implements of the various regions of the Far East are far  from being uniform; there are various separate cultures. In the  north-west of China there is a system of cattle-breeding combined with  agriculture, a distinguishing feature being the possession of finely  polished axes of rectangular section, with a cutting edge. Farther east,  in the north and reaching far to the south, is found a culture with axes  of round or oval section. In the south and in the coastal region from  Nanking to Tonking, Yuennan to Fukien, and reaching as far as the coasts  of Korea and Japan, is a culture with so-called shoulder-axes. Szechwan  and Yuennan represented a further independent culture.    All these cultures were at first independent. Later the shoulder-axe  culture penetrated as far as eastern India. Its people are known to  philological research as Austroasiatics, who formed the original stock  of the Australian aborigines; they survived in India as the Munda  tribes, in Indo-China as the Mon-Khmer, and also remained in pockets on  the islands of Indonesia and especially Melanesia. All these peoples had  migrated from southern China. The peoples with the oval-axe culture are  the so-called Papuan peoples in Melanesia; they, too, migrated from  southern China, probably before the others. Both groups influenced the  ancient Japanese culture. The rectangular-axe culture of north-west  China spread widely, and moved southward, where the Austronesian peoples  (from whom the Malays are descended) were its principal constituents,  spreading that culture also to Japan.    Thus we see here, in this period around 4000 B.C., an extensive mutual  penetration of the various cultures all over the Far East, including  Japan, which in the palaeolithic age was apparently without or almost  without settlers.    5 _The eight principal prehistoric cultures_    In the period roughly around 2500 B.C. the general historical view  becomes much clearer. Thanks to a special method of working, making use  of the ethnological sources available from later times together with the  archaeological sources, much new knowledge has been gained in recent  years. At this time there is still no trace of a Chinese realm; we find  instead on Chinese soil a considerable number of separate local  cultures, each developing on its own lines. The chief of these cultures,  acquaintance with which is essential to a knowledge of the whole later  development of the Far East, are as follows:    (a) _The north-east culture_, centred in the present provinces of Hopei  (in which Peking lies), Shantung, and southern Manchuria. The people of  this culture were ancestors of the Tunguses, probably mixed with an  element that is contained in the present-day Paleo-Siberian tribes.  These men were mainly hunters, but probably soon developed a little  primitive agriculture and made coarse, thick pottery with certain basic  forms which were long preserved in subsequent Chinese pottery (for  instance, a type of the so-called tripods). Later, pig-breeding became  typical of this culture.    (b) _The northern culture_ existed to the west of that culture, in the"]]]
