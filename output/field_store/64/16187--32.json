Most true it was, Beatrice was of another and a higher order. She was  \"among them, not of them.\" She took part in those amusements which  belong to the customs of her country; and filled that place, and  performed those customs, which her station in society demanded, with  unaffected ease and grace. But while the trifles and pleasures of the  passing day were to her companions everything, they were to her little  and unsatisfying. For the last few years of her mother's life, whose  habits were meditative and devotional, she had daily listened to the  gracious lessons of divine truth, and the closet of Beatrice Adony was  hallowed by the Eye that seeth in secret, and that often saw her there  upon her knees.    It was on a fine day, in the early spring of 1796, that orders reached  Salzburgh for the march of these Hungarian hussars. They were to  traverse the Tyrol, and to join the army of Italy. They were to march at  sunrise on the following morning; and Count Adony, collecting all the  acquaintances of the corps in the town and neighbourhood, gave the  Hungarian officers a farewell banquet and ball; preparations for which,  in anticipation of their early departure, Beatrice had already directed.    Beatrice was the radiant queen of this fair festival; and it was strange  to think, that from the presence of such a being so many men were going  to part without one lover's pang. Amiable, affable, natural, and full of  grace, she presided over this little court of love--serene, unmoved,  herself. Yet any thoughtful and suspicious observer would have said,  that her heart was not quite at ease; for every now and then, as the  night wore on, her eyes gave less attention to those who spoke with her,  and her thoughts were evidently turning inwards with trouble. The supper  was over--the tastefully decorated table was deserted--and the guests  were again assembled in the ball-room. Fond partners that might never  dance with each other again, stood side by side--hand locked in  hand--and waited for the rising swell of the tender music, to which they  were to dance their last waltz. Beatrice stood up with her cousin Count  Zichy, and deadly pale she looked. The Count and all others thought she  had a headach, and would have had her sit down; but she persisted, with  a faint smile, in doing the last honours.    Just at this very moment a manly young officer, whose dress denoted that  he had been on duty, and was ready again to mount and go forward, came  in to make a report to the colonel.    As the first bars of the music were heard, he stood aside, his cap in  his hand, and looked on. Already, however, a young brother officer had  run from his partner's side, to renew to him, with all extravagance of  gratitude, his thanks for having, by an exchange of duty, enabled him to  enjoy a last, long parting with the girl he loved. The dance went  forward, and Julius Alvinzi leaned cheerfully upon his sabre. Suddenly  Count Zichy and his fair cousin broke out from the large circle, and  setting to him, he was led off to the waltz movement before he had time  to ungird his sword. This, however, even as he danced, he gracefully  effected; and afterwards for one tour of waltzing, Beatrice Adony was  the partner of Julius Alvinzi, quitting for the time her own.    This is a custom, in Germany, so common, and seemed so natural and so  kind a courtesy to Julius, under the particular circumstances of his  late and short appearance at the ball, that neither himself, nor any one  in the room, attached to it any other character than that of a pretty  and gentle compliment. But if the ear of Julius had been quickened by  the faintest spark of sympathy, he might have heard the very heart of  Beatrice beat.    \"You are tired,\" said Julius, as the music suddenly ceased.    \"Rather so,\" she replied.    He led her, faint, pale, and trembling, to a seat. Some colour returned  to her cheek as she sat down; and, with an open and cheerful air, she  put out her hand to him, and said, \"Farewell, Captain Alvinzi; all  honour, and all happiness go with you.\"    As he took her hand, he observed, for the first time, that pale-changing  of the cheek which is so eloquent of love; and, looking into her eyes,  he felt his heart sink with a sweeter emotion than he had ever known  before.    Thus silently they parted; and Julius went out from her presence sad,  but happy. \"Il est si doux aimer, et d'etre aime.\" He felt that he was  beloved. In half an hour, the noble gateway at Salzburgh, cut through  the solid rock, rang to the loud echo of trampling hoofs; and Julius was  riding under it with an advanced guard, and a few troop-sergeants, to  prepare the quarters of the regiment, then mustering for their march.    In all the camps of Europe, a finer youth, or a nobler spirit, could  no where have been found than Julius Alvinzi. Five years of military  service--three of which had been spent in the toils, the watchings,  and the combats of warfare--had accomplished and perfected him in all  points, as the zealous and enterprising leader of a squadron. Glory was  his idol--war his passion. His day-dreams over-leaped the long interval  of years which, of necessity, separated him from high command; and, as  he built up the castle of his future fame, many were the victories which  he won \"in the name of God, and the Kaiser!\" With this, the gallant  war-cry of Austria, he had already, in some few charges, led on his bold  and bitter Hungarians; and two or three dashing affairs of outposts--a,  daring and important reconnoissance, most skilfully conducted--and the  surprise and capture of a French picquet--had already given him an  established name for intelligence and enterprise. There was a manliness  about him superior to low, sensual enjoyment; and the imagery and  language of vulgar voluptuousness found no cell in a well-stored,  well-principled, and masculine mind, to receive or retain them. He was a  happy, handsome, hardy soldier; knowing his duly, loving it, and always  performing it with honour. Such was the man whom Beatrice Adony, with a  quick perception of true nobility of character, had silently observed  during the stay of the Hungarians at Salzburgh, and her love for him was  a secret--      The only jewel of her speechless thoughts.    It was thus in the full lustihood of life, and in all the bloom of high  hope and promise, that in one of those severe actions, which took place  in the summer of 1796 on the plains of Mantua, Julius Alvinzi led his  brave squadron into battle. The brigade to which he belonged was brought  forward by the veteran Wurmser at a very anxious moment, and, by their  devoted courage, saved a column of Austrian infantry from being  enveloped and cut off by the French. The Hungarians charged with such  vigour and success, that they not only overthrew the body of horse  opposed to them, but they possessed themselves of a battery of  field-pieces which endeavoured to cover their retreat, and which  continued to vomit forth grape with a deadly fury till the horses' heads  of the leading squadron, under Alvinzi, reached the very muzzles of the  cannon.    The Austrians were, however, compelled finally to retreat, that same  evening, from the ground which they had so resolutely contested:--the  movement was made in fine order, and they carried off all their wounded  in safety. Upon a crowded wagon lay Julius Alvinzi; living, indeed, but  a living wreck, and his recovery despaired of. He had been wounded in  six places, and lay motionless and insensible; his servant walking by  his side in silent trouble. As the remains of his regiment marched  slowly back upon Mantua, and passed the convoy of the wounded close to  the gates, you might have heard the name of Alvinzi singled out by the  men for more deep and particular lamentation. He had been their friend,  their pride, their example; and their eyes were turned upon the wagon on  which he lay with an expression of sadness too stern and severe for  tears.    The news of this disastrous battle was communicated to Count Adony at  Salzburgh in a letter from his cousin the Count Zichy. Beatrice and her  father were sitting in his library after night-fall, each occupied with  a book, under the calm, soft light of a lamp which hung a little above  them, when this letter was brought in. He read it eagerly and rapidly to  himself; and then, with a grateful exclamation for the safety of Zichy,  and those officers with whom he was more especially acquainted, he again  read it aloud to Beatrice. It ran as follows:--    \"MY DEAR AND HONOURED COUSIN,    \"We are all doing our best; but, I am sorry to say, we are losing  everything except our honour. Fortune is with these Frenchmen. Of six  hundred swords, with which I marched from Salzburgh ten weeks ago, only  two hundred and twenty remain to me. We lost, in the battle of yesterday,  nearly three hundred killed and wounded. I never saw our men fight  better: the enemy opposed to us were fairly beaten at the sword's point;  and we took a battery of twelve guns, which tried to cover their  discomfiture; but we conquered only to retire. I have not a word to say  against old Wurmser: he is a clear headed, tough-hearted veteran, but  these French generals are too young for him. I am quite well, but had a  narrow escape; two horses were killed under me, and a grape shot passed  through my cap.    \"Tell dear Beatrice, I have got that engraving of the Madonna del  Rosario of Domenichino which she wanted. I picked it up at Verona;  thanks to poor Alvinzi, by the way. Though you, neither of you, saw nor  knew much of this youth, you have so often heard me speak of his worth,  that you will be sorry for me when I tell you that I have lost him; and,  in him, my best and most zealous officer. He is covered with wounds, and  cannot live through the night;--the noble fellow was struck down within  a yard of the enemy's guns. Of others, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12545"],[0,"Traditions of the Tinguian: a Study in Philippine Folk-Lore (#3)"],[1,"8). The first hours are spent in bargaining over the price  the girl should bring, but when this is settled a feast is prepared,  and then all indulge in dancing the _tadek_ (p. 59) [15]. When the  payment is made a portion is distributed among the girl's relatives  (pp. 72, 74), but her parents retain the greater part for themselves  [16]. The groom cannot yet claim his bride, although in one case he  is allowed to take her immediately after the _pakalon_ by making a  special payment for the privilege (p. 74). A few nights later the  groom goes to the girl's home carrying with him an empty jar with  which he makes the final payment (p. 73). The customary rice ceremony  [17] follows and he is then entitled to his bride (p. 73). Should the  house or anything in it break at this time, it foretells misfortune  for the couple, hence precautions are taken lest such a sign should,  by accident, be given (p. 60).    In all but two cases mentioned the girl and her husband go to live  with his people. In the first instance their failure to do so raises a  protest; in the second, the girl's parents are of much more importance  than those of the groom, and this may explain their ability to retain  their daughter (pp. 138, 159).    When the bride reaches her future home, she sits on the bamboo floor  with her legs stretched out in front of her. The slats which she  covers are counted and a string of agate beads, equal in length to  the combined width of the slats, is given to her. She now becomes  a full member of the family and seems to be under the orders of her  mother-in-law (p. 60).    The tales give constant sanction for the marriage of near  relatives. Dumanau, we are told, marries his cousin [18], while we  frequently meet with such statements as, \"We are relatives and it is  good for us to be married\", or \"They saw that they were related and  that both possessed magical power, so they were married (p. 35)\". It  appears that a man may live with his sweetheart and have children  by her, yet leave her, and, without reproach, marry another better  fitted to be his wife (p. 54). He may also accept payment for a wife  who has deserted him, apparently without loss of prestige (p. 64). No  objection seems to be raised to a man having two wives so long as  one of these is an inhabitant of the upper world (p. 111), but we  find Kanag telling his former sweetheart that he cannot marry her  since he is now married to another (p. 138). Again, when two women  lay claim to Aponitolau, as their husband, they undergo a test and  the loser returns to her former home (p. 94). However, this rule does  not prevent a man from having several concubines (p. 120). Gawigawen,  we are told, is accompanied to a _pakalon_ by eighteen young girls  who are his concubines (p. 59).    Divorce is twice mentioned, but it seems to call out protest only  from the cast off wife (pp. 63, 149).    Closely associated with the celebration of a marriage seems to be a  ceremony known as _Sayang_, during the progress of which a number of  small structures--the largest known as _balaua_--are built. Judging  by their names and descriptions, we are justified in considering them  \"spirit houses\" as they are to-day.    The details of the extended _Sayang_ ceremony are nowhere given,  but so much is made plain:--At its beginning many people pound rice,  for use in the offerings and for food, and _da-eng_ [19] is danced  (p. 40). After the _Libon_ [20] invitations are sent out, by means of  betel-nuts covered with gold, to those whose presence is especially  desired (p. 62). When the guests arrive at the village spring or  gate they are offered food or drink, and then while they dance they  are sprinkled with water or rice, after which all go up to the town  (p. 41 note 2). A medium who knows the customs and desires of the  spirits constructs a bamboo mat, which is known as _talapitap_, and  on it offers food. To call their attention she frequently strikes  the ground with the _dakidak_--split sticks of bamboo and _lono_  [21] (p. 40). The guests are not neglected, so far as regards food,  for feasting and dancing occupy a considerable portion of their  time. The ceremonial dance _da-eng_ is mentioned, but the _tadek_  [22] seems to be the one in special favor (pp. 41, 59).    One tale tells us that the _Sayang_ was held immediately following  a head hunt; and another, that Aponitolau went out to get the head  of an old man before he started this ceremony (pp. 69, 76); however,  the evidence is by no means conclusive that it is related to warfare.    On page 105 we are told that Kanag's half sister is a medium, and  the description of her method of summoning the spirits tallies with  that of to-day. At the _Sayang_ ceremony she is called to perform  the _Dawak_ [23], with the assistance of the old woman Alokotan  (p. 106). The _Dawak_ is also held in order to stop the flow of blood  from Aponitolau's finger (p. 113). The only other ceremony mentioned  is that made in order to find a lost switch (p. 91).    Certain well-known customs are strongly brought out in our  material. The first, and apparently most important, is the necessity  of offering liquor and food, both to strangers and to guests  (p. 58). Refusal is so keenly resented that in one instance a couple  decline to allow their daughter to marry a man whose emissaries reject  this gift (p. 73). Old quarrels are closed by the tender of food or  drink, and friendships are cemented by the drinking of _basi_ [24]  (p. 134). People meeting for the first time, and even friends who  have been separated for a while, chew betel-nut together and tell  their names and places of residence. We are repeatedly told that  it is necessary to chew the nut and make known their names, for  \"we cannot tell our names unless we chew,\" and \"it is bad for us if  we do not know each other's names when we talk.\" A certain etiquette  is followed at this time: old men precede the younger; people of the  home town, the visitors; and men always are before the women (pp. 45,  133). The conduct of Awig when he serves liquor to the _alzados_  [25] is that of to-day, i.e., the person who serves always drinks  before passing it to others (p. 156).    Certain other rules of etiquette or restrictions on conduct come out  in the tales. We learn that it is not considered proper for a man  to eat with the wife of another during his absence, nor should they  start the meal before he comes in (p. 52). The master of a dance is  deeply chagrined and chides his wife severely, because she insists  on dancing before he has invited all the others to take their turns  (p. 70). Greediness is reproved in children and Aponitolau causes the  death of his concubines whose false tales had led him to maltreat his  wife (p. 116). Unfaithfulness seems to be sufficient justification  for a man to abandon his wife and kill her admirer (p. 78); but Kanag  appears as a hero when he refuses to attack his father who has sought  his life (p. 121).    Of the ceremonies connected with death we learn very little except that  the women discard their arm beads, the mourners don old clothing, and  all wail for the dead (pp. 44, 90). Three times we are told that the  deceased is placed on a _tabalang_, or raft, on which a live rooster is  fastened before it is set adrift on the river. In the tales the raft  and fowl are of gold, but this is surprising even to the old woman  Alokotan, past whose home in Nagbotobotan all these rafts must go  (p. 131).    Up to this time in our reconstruction of the life of \"the first  times\" we have mentioned nothing impossible or improbable to the  present day Tinguian, although, as we shall see later, there are some  striking differences in customs and ideas. We have purposely left the  description of the people and their practice of magic to the last,  although their magical practices invade every activity of their lives,  for it is here that the greatest variations from present conditions  apparently occur.    These people had intimate relations with some of the lesser spirits,  especially with the _liblibayan_ [26], who appear to be little more  than their servants, with the evil spirits known as _banbanayo_,  and with the _alan_ (p. 123). The _alan_, just mentioned, are to-day  considered as deformed spirits who live in the forests: \"They are  as large as people but have wings and can fly; their toes are at  the back of their feet and their fingers point backwards from their  wrists.\" The several references to them in the tales such as \"you  _alan_ girls whose toes on your feet turn out\" indicate they were so  considered in the first times (p. 161). Some of them are addressed as  \"you _alan_ of the springs,\" and in one instance a man dives down  into the water where the _alan_ live (p. 148), but in general their  homes seem to be similar to but much finer than those of the people  of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan. These spirits appear time after time as  the foster mothers of the leading characters: Generally they secure  a drop of menstrual blood, a miscarriage, or the afterbirth, and all  unknown to the real parents, change them into children and raise them  (p. 83). These foster children are pictured as living in houses of  gold situated near springs, the pebbles of which are of gold or beads;  [27] the places where the women set the pots while dipping water are  big plates or dishes, while similar dishes form the stepping stones  leading up to the house. Articles of gold are found in the dwellings  and valuable jars are numerous. When the true relationships of these  children are established they always go to their blood parents,  carrying with them these riches, which are a source of wonder and  comment (pp. 43, 64).    The people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan have many dealings with  the celestial bodies. The big star Bagbagak appears as the husband  of Sinag--the moon--and father of the star maiden Gaygayoma, who,  Aponitolau assures his"]]]
