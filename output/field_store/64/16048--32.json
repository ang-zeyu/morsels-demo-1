He didn't pass a shovelful of coal in the hole yesterday.\"    \"Tut, tut,\" answered the other with a wave of the hand. \"I sent orders  to Campbell, and told him what sort of a man he could expect to find in  Harrigan.\"    \"I've just talked to the firemen. They say that Harrigan didn't handle  a single pound of coal. That ought to be final.\"    Henshaw went black.    \"It may be so. I've given more rope to old Campbell than to any man  that ever sailed the seas with White Henshaw, and it may be he's using  the rope now to hang himself. We'll find out, McTee; we'll find out!  Where's Harrigan now?\"    \"Gone below a while ago after he finished scrubbing down the bridge.\"    \"We'll speak with Douglas. Come along, McTee. There's nothing like  discipline on the high seas.\"    He went below, murmuring to himself, with McTee close behind him.  Strange sounds were coming from the room of the chief engineer, sounds  which seemed much like the strumming of a guitar.    \"He's playing his songs,\" grinned Henshaw, and he chuckled noiselessly.  \"Listen! We'll give him something to sing about--and it'll be in  another key. Ha-ha!\"    He tasted the results of his disciplining already, but just as he  placed his hand on the knob of the door, another sound checked him and  made him turn with a puzzled frown toward McTee. It was a ringing  baritone voice which rose in an Irish love song.    \"What the devil--\" began Henshaw.    \"You're right,\" nodded McTee. \"It's the devil--Harrigan. Open the  door!\"    The captain flung it open, and they discovered the two worthies seated  at ease with a black bottle and two glasses at hand. Campbell, in the  manner of a musical critic of some skill, leaned back in a chair with  his brawny arms folded behind his head and his eyes half closed.  Harrigan, tilted back in a chair, rested his feet on the edge of a  small table and swept the guitar which lay on his lap. In the midst of  a high note he saw the ominous pair standing in the door, and the music  died abruptly on his lips.    He rose to his feet and nudged Campbell at the same time. The latter  opened his eyes and, glimpsing the unwelcome visitors, sprang up,  gasping, stammering.    \"What? Come in! Don't be standing there, Cap'n Henshaw. Come in and sit  down!\"    In spite of his bluster his red face was growing blotched with patches  of gray. Harrigan, less moved than any of the others, calmly replaced  the guitar in its green cloth case.    \"I sent this fellow down to be put at hard work,\" said Henshaw, and  waited.    It was obvious to Harrigan that the chief engineer was in mortal fear.  He himself felt strangely ill at ease as he looked at White Henshaw  with his skin yellow as Egyptian papyrus from a tomb.    \"Just a minute, captain,\" began the engineer. \"You sent Harrigan down  to the hole because he's considered a hard man to handle, eh?\"    Henshaw waited for a fuller explanation; he seemed to be enjoying the  distress of Campbell.    \"Just so,\" went on the Scotchman, \"but there are two ways of handling a  difficult sailor. One is by using the club and the other by using  kindness. The club has been tried and hasn't worked very well with  Harrigan. I decided to take a hand with kindness. The results have been  excellent. I was just about--\"    His voice died away, for McTee was chuckling in a deep bass rumble, and  Henshaw was smiling in a way that boded no good.    The captain broke in coldly: \"I've heard enough of your explanation,  Campbell. Send Harrigan down to the hole at once. We'll work him a  double shift today, for a starter.\"    Campbell was trembling like a self-conscious girl, for he was drawn  between shame and dread of the captain.    \"Look!\" he cried, and taking the hand of Harrigan, he turned it palm  up. \"This chap has been brutally treated. He's been at work that fairly  tore the skin from the palms of his hands. One hour's work with a  shovel, captain, would make Harrigan useless at any sort of a job for a  month.\"    \"Which goes to show,\" said McTee, \"that you don't know Harrigan.\"    \"I've heard what you have to say,\" said Henshaw. \"I sent him down to  work in the hole; I come down and find him singing in your room. I  expect you to have him passing coal inside of fifteen minutes,  Campbell.\"    Harrigan started for the door, feeling that the game had been played  out, and glad of even this small respite of a day or more from the  labor of the shovel. Before he left the room, however, the voice of  Campbell halted him.    \"Wait! Stay here! You'll do what I tell you, Harrigan. I'm the boss  belowdecks.\"    It was a declaration of war, and what it cost Campbell no one could  ever tell. He stood swaying slightly from side to side, while he glared  at Henshaw.    \"You're drunk,\" remarked the captain coldly. \"I'll give you half an  hour, Campbell, to come to your senses--but after that--\"    \"Damn you and your time! I want no tune! I say the lad has been put  through hell and shan't go back to it, do you hear me?\"    Henshaw was controlling himself carefully, or else he wished to draw  out the engineer.    He said: \"You know the record of Harrigan?\"    \"What record? The one McTee told you? Would you believe what Black  McTee says of a man he tried to break and couldn't?\"    \"My friend McTee is out of the matter. All that you have to do with is  my order. You've heard that order, Campbell!\"    \"I'll see you in hell before I send him to the hole.\"    Henshaw waited another moment, quietly enjoying the wild excitement of  the engineer like the Spanish gentleman who sits in safety in the  gallery and watches the baiting of the bull in the arena below.    \"I shall send that order to you in writing. If you refuse to obey then,  I shall act!\"    He turned on his heel; McTee stayed a moment to smile upon Harrigan,  and then followed. As the door closed, Harrigan turned to Campbell and  found him sitting, shuddering, with his face buried in his hands. He  touched the Scotchman on the shoulder.    \"You've done your part, chief. I won't let you do any more. I'm  starting now for the hole.\"    \"What?\" bellowed Campbell. \"Am I no longer the boss of my engine room?  You'll sit here till I tell you to move! Damn Henshaw and his written  orders!\"    \"If you refuse to obey a written order, he can take your license away  from you in any marine court.\"    \"Let it go.\"    \"Ah-h, chief, ye're afther bein' a thrue man an' a bould one, but I'd  rather stay the rest av me life in the hole than let ye ruin yourself  for me. Whisht, man, I'm goin'! Think no more av it!\"    Campbell's eyes grew moist with the temptation, but then the fighting  blood of his clan ran hot through his veins.    \"Sit down,\" he commanded. \"Sit down and wait till the order comes. It's  a fine thing to be chief engineer, but it's a better thing to be a man.  What does Bobbie say?\"    And he quoted in a ringing voice: \"A man's a man for a' that!\"  Afterward they sat in silence that grew more tense as the minutes  passed, but it seemed that Henshaw, with demoniac cunning, had decided  to prolong the agony by delaying his written order and the consequent  decision of the engineer. And Harrigan, watching the suffused face of  Campbell, knew that the time had come when his will would not suffice  to make him follow the dictates of his conscience.    All of which Henshaw knew perfectly well as he sat in his cabin filling  the glass of McTee with choice Scotch.    They sat for an hour or more, chatting, and McTee drew a picture of the  pair waiting below in silent dread--a picture so vivid that Henshaw  laughed in his breathless way. In time, however, he decided that they  had delayed long enough, and took up pen and paper to write the order  which was to convince the dauntless Campbell that even he was a slave.  As he did so, Sloan, the wireless operator, appeared at the door,  saying: \"The report has come, sir.\"          CHAPTER 23      He held a little folded paper in his hand. At sight of it Henshaw  turned in his chair and faced Sloan with a wistful glance.    \"Good?\"    \"Not very, sir.\"    Henshaw rose slowly and frowned like the king on the messenger who  bears tidings of the lost battie.    \"Then very bad?\"    \"I'm afraid so.\"    \"Very well. Let me have the message. You may go.\"    He took the slip of paper cautiously, as if it were dangerous in  itself, and then called back the operator as the latter reached the  door.    \"Come back a minute. Sloan, you're a good boy--a very good boy.  Faithful, intelligent; you know your business. H-m! Here--here's a five  spot\"--he slipped the money into Sloan's hand--\"and you shall have more  when we touch port. Now this message, my lad--you couldn't have made  any mistake in receiving it? You couldn't have twisted any of the words  a little?\"    \"No mistake, I'm sure, sir. It was repeated twice.\"    \"That makes it certain, then--certain,\" muttered Henshaw. \"That is all,  Sloan.\"    As the latter left the cabin, the old captain went back to his chair  and sat with the paper resting upon his knee, as if a little delay  might change its import.    \"I am growing old, McTee,\" he said at last, apologetically, \"and age  affects the eyes first of all. Suppose you take this message, eh? And  read it through to me--slowly--I hate fast reading, McTee.\"    The big Scotchman took the slip of paper and read with a long pause  between each word:    _Beatrice--failing--rapidly--hemorrhage--this--morning--very--weak._    The paper was snatched from his hand, and Henshaw repeated the words  over and over to himself: \"Weak--failing--hemorrhage--the fools! A  little bleeding at the nose they call a hemorrhage!\"    McTee broke in: \"A good many doctors are apt to make a case seem more  serious than it is. They get more credit that way for the cure, eh?\"    \"God bless you, lad! Aye, they're a lot of damnable curs! Burning at  sea--death by fire at sea! He was right! The old devil was right! Look,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9793"],[0,"Josephus (#20)"],[1,"n, though he might live  out of danger? Who is there so much his country's enemy, or so unmanly  and so desirous of living, as not to repent that he is still alive? And  I cannot but wish that we had all died before we had seen that holy city  demolished by the hands of our enemies, or the foundations of our holy  Temple dug up after so profane a manner. But since we had a generous  hope that deluded us, as if we might perhaps have been able to avenge  ourselves on our enemies, on that account, though it be now become  vanity, and hath left us alone in this distress, let us make haste to  die bravely. Let us pity ourselves, our children, and our wives, while  it is in our power to show pity to them; for we are born to die, as well  as those whom we have begotten; nor is it in the power of the most happy  of our race to avoid it. But for abuses and slavery and the sight of our  wives led away after an ignominious manner with their children, these  are not such evils as are natural and necessary among men; although such  as do not prefer death before those miseries, when it is in their power  to do so, must undergo even them on account of their own cowardice.'    \"Responding to their leader's call, the defenders put their wives and  children to the sword, and then turned their hands on themselves: and  when the Romans entered the place, to their amazement and horror they  found not a living soul.\"    Eleazar's speech is one of the few patriotic outbursts in the seven  books of the Wars, and it reads like a cry of bitter regret wrung from  the unhappy author at the end of his work. Like Balaam he set out to  curse, and stayed to bless, his enemies, and cursed himself. Perhaps  this apostrophe hides the tragedy of Josephus' life. Perhaps he inwardly  repented of his cowardice, and rued the uneasy protection he had secured  for himself. Perhaps he had denounced the Zealots throughout the history  perforce, to please his taskmasters, and in his heart of hearts envied  the party that had preferred death to surrender. We could wish he had  ended with the story of Masada's noble fall, and left us at this  pathetic doubt. But he had not the dramatic sense, and he rounds off the  story of the wars with an account of the futile Jewish rising in  Alexandria and Cyrene, fomented by the surviving remnants of the  Zealots. The first led to the closing in Egypt of the Temple of Onias,  the last sanctuary of the Jews; the second to slanderous attacks on the  historian. Jonathan, who had stirred up the Cyrenaic rising and started  the slanders, was tortured and burnt alive. As to Catullus, the Roman  governor, who admitted the calumnies, though the Emperor spared him, he  fell into a terrible distemper and died miserably. \"Thus he became a  signal instance of Divine Providence, and demonstrated that God punishes  the wicked.\"    Instead of concluding upon some national reflection, Josephus,  pathetically enough, disfigures the end of his work with a final  revelation of personal vanity and materialistic views of a Providence  intervening on his behalf. Egoism and incapacity to attain to the noble  and sublime either in action or thought were the two defects that  lowered Josephus as a man, and which mar him as an historian. In the  last paragraph of the work he insists that he has aimed alone at  agreement with the facts; but industrious as is the record of events,  the claim is shallow. His history of the Jewish wars lacks authority  because it is palpably designed to please the Roman taste, and because  also it has to serve as a personal apology for one who, when heroism was  called for, had failed to respond to the call, and who was thus rendered  incapable in letters as in life of being a faithful champion of his  people.          VI    JOSEPHUS AND THE BIBLE      In the preface to the _Antiquities_ Josephus draws a distinction between  his motives for the composition of that work and of the _Wars_. He wrote  the latter because he himself had played a large part in the war, and he  desired to correct the errors of other historians, who had perverted the  truth. On the other hand, he undertook to write the earlier history of  his people because of the great importance of the events themselves and  of his desire to reveal for the common benefit things that were buried  in ignorance. He was stimulated to the task by the fact that his  forefathers had been willing to communicate their antiquity to the  Greeks, and, moreover, several of the Greeks had been at pains to learn  of the affairs of the Jewish nation.    It would appear that he is here referring to the Septuagint translation of  the Bible, since he proceeds to summarize the well-known story of King  Ptolemy recounted in the Letter of Aristeas, which he afterwards sets out  more fully.[1] Josephus shares the aim of the Hellenistic-Jewish writers  to make the Jewish Scriptures known to the Gentile world, and he inherits  also, but in a much smaller degree, their method of presenting Judaism to  suit Greek or Greco-Roman tastes, as a philosophical, i.e. an ethical-  philosophical, religion. Perhaps he had become acquainted, either at  Alexandria or at Rome, with Philo's _Life of Moses_, which was a popular  text-book, so to speak, of universal Judaism. Certain it is that the  prelude to the _Antiquities_ is reminiscent of the earlier treatise.  Josephus reproduces Philo's idea that Moses began his legislation not as  other lawgivers, \"with the detailed enactments, contracts, and other rites  between one man and another, but by raising men's minds upwards to regard  God and His creation.\" For Moses life was to be an imitation of the  divine. Contemplation of God's work is the best of all patterns for man to  follow. With Philo again, he points out the superiority of Moses over  other legislators in his attack upon false ideas of the divine nature;  \"for there is nothing in the Scriptures inconsistent with the majesty of  God or with His love of mankind: and all things in it have reference to  the nature of the universe.\" He claims, too, that Moses explains some  things clearly and directly, but that he hints at others philosophically  under the form of allegory. And to these commonplaces of Alexandrian  exegesis he adds as the lesson of the history of his people that \"it goes  well with those who follow God's will and observe His laws, and ill with  those who rebel against Him and neglect His laws.\" To exhibit to the  Greco-Roman world the power and majesty of the Jewish God and the  excellence of the Jewish law--these are the two main purposes which he  professes to set before himself in his rendering of the Bible story, which  occupies the first half of the _Antiquities_. No Jewish writer before him  had treated the Bible to suit Roman predilections, which attached supreme  importance to material strength and the concrete manifestation of  authority, and Josephus in order to carry out his aim had therefore to  proceed on new lines.    [Footnote 1: See below, p. 175.]    In effect, he rarely attempts to ethicize the Bible story. For the most  part he paraphrases it, cuts out its poetry, and reduces it to a prosaic  chronicle of facts. The exordium in fact has little relation to the  book, and looks as if it were borrowed without discrimination. Josephus  next, indeed, professes that he will accurately set out in chronological  order the incidents in the Jewish annals, \"without adding anything to  what is therein contained or taking anything away from it.\" It may be  that he regarded the oral tradition as an inherent part of the law, and  therefore inserts selections of it in the narrative, but anyhow he does  not observe strictly the command of Deuteronomy (4:2) that prompted his  profession, \"Ye shall not add unto the word I have spoken, neither shall  ye diminish aught from it.\" Not only does he freely paraphrase the  Septuagint version of the Bible, but, more especially in the earlier  part of the work, he incorporates pieces of Palestinian Haggadah and to  a smaller extent of Alexandrian interpretation, and he omits many  episodes that did not seem to him to redound to the glory of his people.  He seeks to improve the Bible, and though he did not invent new legends,  he accepted uncritically those which he found in Hellenistic sources or  in the oral tradition of his people. His work is, therefore, valuable as  a storehouse of early Haggadah. It is unnecessary to accept his  description of himself as one who had a profound knowledge of tradition,  but he was acquainted with the popular exegesis of the Palestinian  teachers; and twenty years of life at the Roman court had not entirely  eliminated his knowledge.    In the very first section of the first book, he notes that Moses sums up  the first day of Creation with the words, \"and it was _one_ day\";  whereas afterwards it is said, \"it was the second, the third day, etc.\"  He does not indeed supply the interpretation, saying that he will give  the reason in a separate treatise which he proposes to write; but the  same point is discussed in the Rabbinic commentary. He gives the  traditional interpretation of the four rivers of the Garden of Eden.[1]  He derives the name Adam from the Hebrew word for red, because the first  man was formed out of red earth.[2] He states that the animals in the  Garden of Eden had one language, a piece of Midrash which occurs also in  the Book of Jubilees. He relates that Cain, after the murder of his  brother, was afraid of falling among wild beasts, agreeing with the  Midrash that all the animals assembled to avenge the blood of Abel,[3]  but God forbade them to destroy Cain on pain of their own destruction.  Seth he describes as the model of the virtuous, and of him the Rabbis  likewise say, \"From Seth dates the stock of all generations of the  virtuous.\" He pictures him also as a great inventor and the discoverer  of astronomy, and tells how he set up pillars of brick and"]]]
