Among Them there are many degrees and many lines of activity; but always  some of Them remain within touch of our earth as members of this Hierarchy  which has in charge the administration of the affairs of our world and of  the spiritual evolution of our humanity.    This august body is often called the Great White Brotherhood, but its  members are not a community all living together. Each of Them, to a large  extent, draws Himself apart from the world, and They are in constant  communication with one another and with Their Head; but Their knowledge of  higher forces is so great that this is achieved without any necessity for  meeting in the physical world. In many cases They continue to live each in  His own country, and Their power remains unsuspected among those who live  near Them. Any man who will may attract Their attention, but he can do it  only by showing himself worthy of Their notice. None need fear that his  efforts will pass unnoticed; such oversight is impossible, for the man who  is devoting himself to service such as this, stands out from the rest of  humanity like a great flame in a dark night. A few of these great Adepts,  who are thus working for the good of the world, are willing to take as  apprentices those who have resolved to devote themselves utterly to the  service of mankind; such Adepts are called Masters.    One of these apprentices was Helena Petrovna Blavatsky--a great soul who  was sent out to offer knowledge to the world. With Colonel Henry Steel  Olcott she founded The Theosophical Society for the spread of this  knowledge which she had to give. Among those who came into contact with her  in those early days was Mr. A.P. Sinnett, the editor of _The Pioneer_, and  his keen intellect at once grasped the magnitude and the importance of the  teaching which she put before him. Although Madame Blavatsky herself had  previously written _Isis Unveiled_, it had attracted but little attention,  and it was Mr. Sinnett who first made the teaching really available for  western readers in his two books, _The Occult World_ and _Esoteric  Buddhism_.    It was through these works that I myself first came to know their author,  and afterwards Madame Blavatsky herself; from both of them I learned much.  When I asked Madame Blavatsky how one could learn still more, how one could  make definite progress along the Path which she pointed out to us, she told  me of the possibility that other students might be accepted as apprentices  by the great Masters, even as she herself had been accepted, and that the  only way to gain such acceptance was to show oneself worthy of it by  earnest and altruistic work. She told me that to reach that goal a man must  be absolutely one-pointed in his determination; that no one who tried to  serve both God and Mammon could ever hope to succeed. One of these Masters  Himself had said: \"In order to succeed, a pupil must leave his own world  and come into ours.\"    This means that he must cease to be one of the majority who live for wealth  and power, and must join the tiny minority who care nothing for such  things, but live only in order to devote themselves selflessly to the good  of the world. She warned us clearly that the way was difficult to tread,  that we should be misunderstood and reviled by those who still lived in the  world, and that we had nothing to look forward to but the hardest of hard  work; and though the result was sure, no one could foretell how long it  would take to arrive at it. Some of us accepted these conditions joyfully,  and we have never for a moment regretted the decision.    After some years of work I had the privilege of coming into contact with  these great Masters of the Wisdom; from Them I learnt many things--among  others, how to verify for myself at first hand most of the teachings which  They had given. So that, in this matter, I write of what I know, and what I  have seen for myself. Certain points are mentioned in the teaching, for the  verification of which powers are required far beyond anything which I have  gained so far. Of them, I can say only that they are consistent with what I  do know, and in many cases are necessary as hypotheses to account for what  I have seen. They came to me, along with the rest of the Theosophical  system, upon the authority of these mighty Teachers. Since then I have  learnt to examine for myself by far the greater part of what I was told,  and I have found the information given to me to be correct in every  particular; therefore I am justified in assuming the probability that that  other part, which as yet I cannot verify, will also prove to be correct  when I arrive at its level.    To attain the honour of being accepted as an apprentice of one of the  Masters of the Wisdom is the object set before himself by every earnest  Theosophical student. But it means a determined effort. There have always  been men who were willing to make the necessary effort, and therefore there  have always been men who knew. The knowledge is so transcendent that when a  man grasps it fully he becomes more than man and he passes beyond our ken.    But there are stages in the acquirement of this knowledge, and we may learn  much if we will, from those who themselves are still in process of  learning; for all human beings stand on one or other of the rungs of the  ladder of evolution. The primitive stand at its foot; we who are civilized  beings have already climbed part of the way. But though we can look back  and see rungs of the ladder below us which we have already passed, we may  also look up and see many rungs above us to which we have not yet attained.  Just as men are standing even now on each of the rungs below us, so that we  can see the stages by which man has mounted, so also are there men standing  on each of the rungs above us, so that from studying them we may see how  man shall mount in the future. Precisely because we see men on every step  of this ladder, which leads up to a glory which as yet we have no words to  express, we know that the ascent to that glory is possible for us. Those  who stand high above us, so high that They seem to us as gods in Their  marvellous knowledge and power, tell us that They stood not long since  where we are standing now, and They indicate to us clearly the steps which  lie between, which we also must tread if we would be as They.          Chapter III    THE FORMATION OF A SOLAR SYSTEM      The beginning of the universe (if ever it had a beginning) is beyond our  ken. At the earliest point of history that we can reach, the two great  opposites of spirit and matter, of life and form, are already in full  activity. We find that the ordinary conception of matter needs a revision,  for what are commonly called force and matter are in reality only two  varieties of Spirit at different stages in evolution and the real matter or  basis of everything lies in the background unperceived. A French scientist  has recently said: \"There is no matter; there are nothing but holes in the  aether.\" This also agrees with the celebrated theory of Professor Osborne  Reynolds. Occult investigation shows this to be the correct view, and in  that way explains what Oriental sacred books mean when they say that matter  is an illusion.    The ultimate root-matter as seen at our level is what scientists call the  aether of space. [This has been described in _Occult Chemistry_ under the  name of koilon.] To every physical sense the space occupied by it appears  empty, yet in reality this aether is far denser than anything of which we  can conceive. Its density is defined by Professor Reynolds as being ten  thousand times greater than that of water, and its mean pressure as seven  hundred and fifty thousand tons to the square inch.    This substance is perceptible only to highly developed clairvoyant power.  We must assume a time (though we have no direct knowledge on this point)  when this substance filled all space. We must also suppose that some great  Being (not the Deity of a solar system, but some Being almost infinitely  higher than that) changed this condition of rest by pouring out His spirit  or force into a certain section of this matter, a section of the size of a  whole universe. This effect of the introduction of this force is as that of  the blowing of a mighty breath; it has formed within this aether an  incalculable number of tiny spherical bubbles, [The bubbles are spoken of  in _The Secret Doctrine_ as the holes which Fohat digs in space.] and these  bubbles are the ultimate atoms of which what we call matter is composed.  They are not the atoms of the chemist, nor even the ultimate atoms of the  physical world. They stand at a far higher level, and what are usually  called atoms are composed of vast aggregations of these bubbles, as will be  seen later.    When the Solar Deity begins to make His system, He finds ready to His hand  this material--this infinite mass of tiny bubbles which can be built up  into various kinds of matter as we know it. He commences by defining the  limit of His field of activity, a vast sphere whose circumference is far  larger than the orbit of the outermost of His future planets. Within the  limit of that sphere He sets up a kind of gigantic vortex--a motion which  sweeps together all the bubbles into a vast central mass, the material of  the nebula that is to be.    Into this vast revolving sphere He sends forth successive impulses of  force, gathering together the bubbles into ever more and more complex  aggregations, and producing in this way seven gigantic interpenetrating  worlds of matter of different degrees of density, all concentric and all  occupying the same space.    Acting through His Third Aspect He sends forth into this stupendous sphere  the first of these impulses.

North of the Namoi River, a line from B through A to C on the junction of  the Gwydir and Darling Rivers.  The situation of this junction afforded a curious illustration of the  principle which guided me in choosing my route from the great Namoi  Lagoon on the 14th of January. Having been then between two rivers (at A)  I chose the bearing of 20 degrees west of north, as given by the bearing  of the high land (B) in the opposite direction, and this junction (C) was  now found to be exactly in that line. That high land was a projecting  point of a range; the course of rivers is conformable to the angles of  such ranges, and therefore the rivers on each side of me (at A) were not  so likely to come in my way in the direction of AC, as in any other  direction I could have chosen. The chance of finding firm ground in that  direction was also better, as the rivers were only likely to continue  separate by the protrusion of some remote offset of ground between them,  from the salient feature B.

I venture to name this  animal with considerable hesitation, having neglected to take a note of  the generic characters, while the specimen was yet within my reach.
