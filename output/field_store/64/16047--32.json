We know of several examples of  prolonged sleep during which the sleeper naturally took no nourishment.  In his Magic Disquisitions, Delvis cites the case of a countryman who  slept for an entire autumn and winter. Pfendler relates that a certain  young and hysterical woman fell twice into a deep slumber which each  time lasted six months. In 1883 an _enceinte_ woman was found asleep  on a bench in the Grand Armee Avenue. She was taken to the Beaujon  Hospital, where she was delivered a few days after while still asleep,  and it was not till the end of three months that she could be awakened  from her lethargy. At this very moment, at Tremeille, a woman named  Marguerite Bouyenvalle is sleeping a sleep that has lasted nearly a  year, during which the only food that she has had is a few drops of soup  daily.    What is more remarkable, Dr. Fournier says in his Dictionary of Medical  Sciences that he knew of a distinguished writer at Paris, who sometimes  went for months at a time without taking anything but emollient drinks,  while at the same time living along like other people.    Respiration is certainly more necessary to life than food is; but it is  not absolutely indispensable, as we have seen in the cases of apparent  death cited in our previous article. It is possible, through exercise,  for a person to accustom himself, up to a certain point, to abstinence  from air as he can from food. Those who dive for pearls, corals, or  sponges succeed in remaining from two to three minutes under water. Miss  Lurline, who exhibited in Paris in 1882, remained two and a half minutes  beneath the water of her aquarium without breathing. In his treatise De  la Nature, Henri de Rochas, physician to Louis XIII., gives six minutes  as the maximum length of time that can elapse between successive  inspirations of air. It is probable that this figure was based upon an  observation of hibernating animals.    In his Encyclopedic Dictionary, Dr. Dechambre relates the history of  a Hindoo who hid himself in the waters of the Ganges where women were  bathing, seized one of them by the legs, drowned her, and then removed  her jewels. Her disappearance was attributed to crocodiles. One woman  who succeeded in escaping him denounced the assassin, who was seized and  hanged in 1817.    A well known case, is that of Col. Townshend, who possessed the  remarkable faculty of stopping at will not only his respiration, but  also the beating of his heart. He performed the experiment one day in  the presence of Surgeon Gosch, who cared for him in his old age, two  physicians, and his apothecary, Mr. Shrine. In their presence, says  Gosch, the Colonel lay upon his back, Dr. Cheyne watched his pulse, Dr.  Baynard put his hand upon his heart, and Mr. Shrine held a mirror to  his mouth. After a few seconds no pulse, movement of the heart, or  respiration could be observed. At the end of half an hour, as the  spectators were beginning to get frightened, they observed the functions  progressively resuming their course, and the Colonel came back to life.    The fakirs of India habituate themselves to abstinence from air, either  by introducing into the nostrils strings that come out through the  mouth, or by dwelling in subterranean cells that air and light never  enter except through narrow crevices that are sometimes filled with  clay. Here they remain seated in profound silence, for hours at a time,  without any other motion than that of the fingers as the latter slowly  take beads from a chaplet, the mind absorbed by the mental pronunciation  of OM (the holy triune name), which they must repeat incessantly while  endeavoring to breathe as little as possible. They gradually lengthen  the intervals between their inspirations and expirations, until, in  three or four months, they succeed in making them an hour and a half.  This is not the ideal, for one of their sacred books says, in speaking  of a saint: \"At the fourth month he no longer takes any food but air,  and that only every twelve days, and, master of his respiration he  embraces God in his thought. At the fifth he stands as still as a pole;  he no longer sees anything but Baghavat, and God touches his cheek to  bring him out of his ecstasy.\"    It will be conceived that by submitting themselves to such gymnastics  from infancy, certain men, already predisposed by atavism or a peculiar  conformation, might succeed in doing things that would seem impossible  to the common run of mortals. Do we not daily see acrobats remaining  head downward for a length of time that would suffice to kill 99 per  cent, of their spectators through congestion if they were to place  themselves in the same posture? Can the savage who laboriously learns  to spell, letter by letter, comprehend how many people get the general  sense of an entire page at a single glance?    There is no reason, then, _a priori_, for assigning to the domain of  legerdemain the astonishing facts that are told us by a large number of  witnesses, worthy of credence, regarding a young fakir who, forty years  ago, was accustomed to allow himself to be buried, and resuscitated  several months afterward.    An English officer, Mr. Osborne, gives the following account of one of  these operations, which took place in 1838 at the camp of King Randjet  Singh:    \"After a few preparations, which lasted some days, and that it would  prove repugnant to enumerate, the fakir declared himself ready to  undergo the ordeal. The Maharajah, the Sikhs chiefs, and Gen. Ventura,  assembled near a masonry tomb that had been constructed expressly to  receive him. Before their eyes, the fakir closed with wax all the  apertures in his body (except his mouth) that could give entrance  to air. Then, having taken off the clothing that he had on, he was  enveloped in a canvas sack, and, according to his wish, his tongue was  turned back in such a way as to close the entrance to his windpipe.  Immediately after this he fell into a sort of trance. The bag that held  him was closed and a seal was put upon it by the Maharajah. The bag was  then put into a wooden box, which was fastened by a padlock, sealed, and  let down into the tomb. A large quantity of earth was thrown into the  hole and rammed down, and then barley was sown on the surface and  sentinels placed around with orders to watch day and night.    \"Despite all such precautions, the Maharajah had his doubts; so he came  twice in the space of ten months (the time during which the fakir was  buried), and had the tomb opened in his presence. The fakir was in the  bag into which he had been put, cold and inanimate. The ten months  having expired, he was disinterred, Gen. Ventura and Capt. Ward saw the  padlock removed, the seals broken, and the box taken from the tomb.  The fakir was taken out, and no pulsation either at the heart or pulse  indicated the presence of life. As a first measure for reviving him, a  person introduced a finger gently into his mouth and placed his tongue  in its natural position. The top of his head was the only place where  there was any perceptible heat. By slowly pouring warm water over his  body, signs of life were gradually obtained, and after about two hours  of care the patient got up and began to walk.    \"This truly extraordinary man says that during his burial he has  delightful dreams, but that the moment of awakening is always very  painful to him. Before returning to a consciousness of his existence he  experiences vertigoes. His nails and hair cease to grow. His only fear  is that he may be harmed by worms and insects, and it is to protect  himself from these that he has the box suspended in the center of the  tomb.\"    This sketch was published in the _Magasin Pittoresque_ in 1842 by a  writer who had just seen Gen. Ventura in Paris, and had obtained from  him a complete confirmation of the story told by Capt. Wade.    Another English officer, Mr. Boileau, in a work published in 1840,  and Dr. MacGregor, in his medical topography of Lodhiana, narrate two  analogous exhumations that they separately witnessed. The question  therefore merits serious examination.--_A. de Rochas, in La Nature_.           *       *       *       *       *    Some experiments recently made by M. Olszewsky appear to show that  liquid oxygen is one of the best of refrigerants. He found that when  liquefied oxygen was allowed to vaporize under the pressure of one  atmosphere, a temperature as low as -181.4 deg. C. was produced. The  temperature fell still further when the pressure on the liquid oxygen  was reduced to nine millimeters of mercury. Though the pressure was  reduced still further to four millimeters of mercury, yet the oxygen  remained liquid. Liquefied nitrogen, when allowed to evaporate under a  pressure of sixty millimeters of mercury, gave a temperature of -214 deg.  C., only the surface of the liquid gas became opaque from incipient  solidification. Under lower pressures the nitrogen solidified,  and temperatures as low as -225 deg. C. were recorded by the hydrogen  thermometer. The lowest temperature obtained by allowing liquefied  carbonic oxide to vaporize was -220.5 deg. C.           *       *       *       *       *          CONVALLARIA.    By OTTO A. WALL, M.D., Ph.G.      Cnovallaria Majalis is a stemless perennial plant, found in both  the eastern and western hemispheres, with two elliptic leaves and a  one-sided raceme bearing eight or ten bell-shaped flowers. The flowers  are fragrant, and perfumes called \"Lily of the Valley\" are among the  popular odors.    Both leaves and flowers have been used in medicine, but the rhizome is  the part most frequently used.    [Illustration: CONVALLARIA.]    The fresh rhizome is a creeping, branching rhizome of a pale yellowish  white color, which, on drying, darkens to a straw color, or even"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (#20)"],[1,"be visible, if it had not some thickness); and  consequently he ought (it is argued) to acknowledge that his countrymen  are not only long and broad, but also (though doubtless to a very  slight degree) THICK or HIGH.  This objection is plausible, and, to  Spacelanders, almost irresistible, so that, I confess, when I first  heard it, I knew not what to reply.  But my poor old friend's answer  appears to me completely to meet it.    \"I admit,\" said he--when I mentioned to him this objection--\"I admit  the truth of your critic's facts, but I deny his conclusions.  It is  true that we have really in Flatland a Third unrecognized Dimension  called 'height,' just as it also is true that you have really in  Spaceland a Fourth unrecognized Dimension, called by no name at  present, but which I will call 'extra-height.'  But we can no more take  cognizance of our 'height' than you can of your 'extra-height.'  Even  I--who have been in Spaceland, and have had the privilege of  understanding for twenty-four hours the meaning of 'height'--even I  cannot now comprehend it, nor realize it by the sense of sight or by  any process of reason; I can but apprehend it by faith.    \"The reason is obvious.  Dimension implies direction, implies  measurement, implies the more and the less.  Now, all our lines are  EQUALLY and INFINITESIMALLY thick (or high, whichever you like);  consequently, there is nothing in them to lead our minds to the  conception of that Dimension.  No 'delicate micrometer'--as has been  suggested by one too hasty Spaceland critic--would in the least avail  us; for we should not know WHAT TO MEASURE, NOR IN WHAT DIRECTION.  When we see a Line, we see something that is long and BRIGHT;  BRIGHTNESS, as well as length, is necessary to the existence of a Line;  if the brightness vanishes, the Line is extinguished.  Hence, all my  Flatland friends--when I talk to them about the unrecognized Dimension  which is somehow visible in a Line--say, 'Ah, you mean BRIGHTNESS': and  when I reply, 'No, I mean a real Dimension,' they at once retort, 'Then  measure it, or tell us in what direction it extends'; and this silences  me, for I can do neither.  Only yesterday, when the Chief Circle (in  other words our High Priest) came to inspect the State Prison and paid  me his seventh annual visit, and when for the seventh time he put me  the question, 'Was I any better?'  I tried to prove to him that he was  'high,' as well as long and broad, although he did not know it.  But  what was his reply?  'You say I am \"high\"; measure my \"high-ness\" and I  will believe you.'  What could I do?  How could I meet his challenge?  I was crushed; and he left the room triumphant.    \"Does this still seem strange to you?  Then put yourself in a similar  position.  Suppose a person of the Fourth Dimension, condescending to  visit you, were to say, 'Whenever you open your eyes, you see a Plane  (which is of Two Dimensions) and you INFER a Solid (which is of Three);  but in reality you also see (though you do not recognize) a Fourth  Dimension, which is not colour nor brightness nor anything of the kind,  but a true Dimension, although I cannot point out to you its direction,  nor can you possibly measure it.' What would you say to such a visitor?  Would not you have him locked up?  Well, that is my fate:  and it is as  natural for us Flatlanders to lock up a Square for preaching the Third  Dimension, as it is for you Spacelanders to lock up a Cube for  preaching the Fourth.  Alas, how strong a family likeness runs through  blind and persecuting humanity in all Dimensions!  Points, Lines,  Squares, Cubes, Extra-Cubes--we are all liable to the same errors, all  alike the Slaves of our respective Dimensional prejudices, as one of  our Spaceland poets has said--           'One touch of Nature makes all worlds akin.'\" (footnote 1)      On this point the defence of the Square seems to me to be impregnable.  I wish I could say that his answer to the second (or moral) objection  was equally clear and cogent.  It has been objected that he is a  woman-hater; and as this objection has been vehemently urged by those  whom Nature's decree has constituted the somewhat larger half of the  Spaceland race, I should like to remove it, so far as I can honestly do  so.  But the Square is so unaccustomed to the use of the moral  terminology of Spaceland that I should be doing him an injustice if I  were literally to transcribe his defence against this charge.  Acting,  therefore, as his interpreter and summarizer, I gather that in the  course of an imprisonment of seven years he has himself modified his  own personal views, both as regards Women and as regards the Isosceles  or Lower Classes.  Personally, he now inclines to the opinion of the  Sphere (see page 86) that the Straight Lines are in many important  respects superior to the Circles.  But, writing as a Historian, he has  identified himself (perhaps too closely) with the views generally  adopted by Flatland, and (as he has been informed) even by Spaceland,  Historians; in whose pages (until very recent times) the destinies of  Women and of the masses of mankind have seldom been deemed worthy of  mention and never of careful consideration.    In a still more obscure passage he now desires to disavow the Circular  or aristocratic tendencies with which some critics have naturally  credited him.  While doing justice to the intellectual power with which  a few Circles have for many generations maintained their supremacy over  immense multitudes of their countrymen, he believes that the facts of  Flatland, speaking for themselves without comment on his part, declare  that Revolutions cannot always be suppressed by slaughter, and that  Nature, in sentencing the Circles to infecundity, has condemned them to  ultimate failure--\"and herein,\" he says, \"I see a fulfilment of the  great Law of all worlds, that while the wisdom of Man thinks it is  working one thing, the wisdom of Nature constrains it to work another,  and quite a different and far better thing.\" For the rest, he begs his  readers not to suppose that every minute detail in the daily life of  Flatland must needs correspond to some other detail in Spaceland; and  yet he hopes that, taken as a whole, his work may prove suggestive as  well as amusing, to those Spacelanders of moderate and modest minds  who--speaking of that which is of the highest importance, but lies  beyond experience--decline to say on the one hand, \"This can never be,\"  and on the other hand, \"It must needs be precisely thus, and we know  all about it.\"      Footnote 1.  The Author desires me to add, that the misconceptions of  some of his critics on this matter has induced him to insert (on pp.  74 and 92) in his dialogue with the Sphere, certain remarks which have  a bearing on the point in question and which he had previously omitted  as being tedious and unnecessary."]]]
