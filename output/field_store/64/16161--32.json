One thing is certain, and that is, that away from him all  services go for nothing; it used to be the contrary.\"  All the court were  of the same opinion as Madame de Sevigne.    A new power was beginning to appear on the horizon, with such modesty and  backwardness that none could as yet discern it, least of all could the  king.  Madame de Montespan had looked out for some one to take care of  and educate her children.  She had thought of Madame Scarron; she  considered her clever; she was so herself, \"in that unique style which  was peculiar to the Mortemarts,\" said the Duke of St. Simon; she was fond  of conversation; Madame Scarron had a reputation of being rather a  blue-stocking; this the king did not like; Madame de Montespan had her  way; Madame Scarron took charge of the children secretly and in an  isolated house.  She was attentive, careful, sensible.  The king was  struck with her devotion to the children intrusted to her.  \"She can  love,\" he said; \"it would be a pleasure to be loved by her.\"  The  confidence of Madame de Montespan went on increasing.  \"The person of  quality (Madame de Montespan) has no partnership with the person who has  a cold (Madame Scarron), for she regards her as the confidential person;  the lady who is at the head of all (the queen) does the same; she is,  therefore, the soul of this court,\" writes Madame de Sevigne in 1680.  There were, however, frequent storms; Madame de Montespan was jealous and  haughty, and she grew uneasy at the nascent liking she observed in the  king for the correct and shrewd judgment, the equable and firm temper, of  his children's governess.  The favor of which she was the object did not  come from Madame de Montespan.  The king had made the Parliament  legitimatize the Duke of Maine, Mdlle. de Nantes, and the Count of Vexin;  they were now formally installed at Versailles.  Louis XIV. often chatted  with Madame Scarron.  She had bought the estate of Maintenon out of the  king's bounty.  He made her take the title.  The recollection of Scarron  was displeasing to him.  \"It is supposed that I am indebted for this  present to Madame de Montespan,\" she wrote to Madame de St. Geran; \"I owe  it to my little prince.  The king was amusing himself with him one day,  and, being pleased with the manner with which he answered his questions,  told him that he was a very sensible little fellow.  'I can't help  being,' said the child, 'I have by me a lady who is sense itself.'  'Go and tell her,' replied the king, 'that you will give her this evening  a hundred thousand francs for your sugar-plums.'  The mother gets me into  trouble with the king, the son makes my peace with him; I am never for  two days together in the same situation, and I do not get accustomed to  this sort of life, I who thought I could make myself used to anything.\"  She often spoke of leaving the court.  \"As I tell you everything  honestly,\" she wrote in 1675 to her confessor, Abbe Gobelin, \"I will not  tell you that it is to serve God that I should like to leave the place  where I am; I believe that I might work out my salvation here and  elsewhere, but I see nothing to forbid us from thinking of our repose,  and withdrawing from a position that vexes us every moment.  I explained  myself badly if you understood me to mean that I am thinking of being a  nun; I am too old for a change of condition, and, according to the  property I shall have, I shall look out for securing one full of  tranquillity.  In the world, all reaction is towards God; in a convent,  all reaction is towards the world; there is one great reason; that of age  comes next.\"  She did not, however, leave the court except to take to the  waters the little Duke of Maine, who had become a cripple after a series  of violent convulsions.  \"Never was anything more agreeable than the  surprise which Madame de Maintenon gave the king,\" writes Madame de  Sdvigne to her daughter.  \"He had not expected the Duke of Maine till the  next day, when he saw him come walking into his room, and only holding by  the hand of his governess; he was transported with joy.  M. do Louvois on  her arrival went to call upon Madame de Maintenon; she supped at Madame  de Richelieu's, some kissing her hand, others her gown, and she making  fun of them all, if she is not much changed; but they say that she is.\"  The king's pleasure in conversing with the governess became more marked  every day; Madame de Montespan frequently burst out into bitter  complaints.  \"She reproaches me with her kindnesses, with her presents,  with those of the king, and has told me that she fed me, and that I am  strangling her; you know what the fact is; it is a strange thing that we  cannot live together and that we cannot separate.  I love her, and I  cannot persuade myself that she hates me.\"  They found themselves alone  together in one of the court carriages.  \"Let us not be duped by such a  thing as this,\" said Madame de Montespan, rudely; \"let us talk as if we  had no entanglements between us to arrange; it being understood, of  course,\" added she, \"that we resume our entanglements when we get back.\"  \"Madame de Maintenon accepted the proposal,\" says Madame de Caylus, who  tells the story, \"and they kept their word to the letter.\"  Madame de  Maintenon had taken a turn for preaching virtue.  \"The king passed two  hours in my closet,\" she wrote to Madame de St. Geran; \"he is the most  amiable man in his kingdom.  I spoke to him of Father Bourdaloue.  He  listened to me attentively.  Perhaps he is not so far from thinking of  his salvation as the court suppose.  He has good sentiments and frequent  reactions towards God.\"  \"The star of Quanto (Madame de Montespan) is  paling,\" writes Madame de Sevigne to her daughter; \"there are tears,  natural pets, affected gayeties, poutings--in fact, my dear, all is  coming to an end.  People look, observe, imagine, believe that there are  to be seen as it were rays of light upon faces which, a month ago, were  thought to be unworthy of comparison with others.  If Quanto had hidden  her face with her cap at Easter in the year she returned to Paris, she  would not be in the agitated state in which she now is.  The spirit,  indeed, was willing, but great is human weakness; one likes to make the  most of a remnant of beauty.  This is an economy which ruins rather than  enriches.\"  \"Madame de Montespan asks advice of me,\" said Madame de  Maintenon; \"I speak to her of God, and she thinks I have some  understanding with the king; I was present yesterday at a very animated  conversation between them.  I wondered at the king's patience, and at the  rage of that vain creature.  It all ended with these terrible words: 'I  have told you already, madame; I will not be interfered with.'\"    Henceforth Madame de Montespan \"interfered with\" the king.  He gave the  new dauphiness Madame de Maintenon as her mistress of the robes.  \"I am  told,\" writes Madame de Sevigne, \"that the king's conversations do  nothing but increase and improve, that they last from six to ten o'clock,  that the daughter-in-law goes occasionally to pay them a shortish visit,  that they are found each in a big chair, and that, when the visit is  over, the talk is resumed.  The lady is no longer accosted without awe  and respect, and the ministers pay her the court which the rest do.  No  friend was ever so careful and attentive as the king is to her; she makes  him acquainted with a perfectly new line of country--I mean the  intercourse of friendship and conversation, without chicanery and without  constraint; he appears to be charmed with it.\"    Discreet and adroit as she was, and artificial without being false,  Madame de Maintenon gloried in bringing back the king and the court to  the ways of goodness.  \"There is nothing so able as irreproachable  conduct,\" she used to say.  The king often went to see the queen; the  latter heaped attentions upon Madame de Maintenon.  \"The king never  treated me more affectionately than he has since she had his ear,\" the  poor princess would say.  The dauphiness had just had a son.  The joy at  court was excessive.  \"The king let anybody who pleased embrace him,\"  says the Abbe de Croisy; \"he gave everybody his hand to kiss.  Spinola,  in the warmth of his zeal, bit his finger; the king began to exclaim.  'Sir,' interrupted the other, 'I ask your Majesty's pardon; but, if I  hadn't bitten you, you would not have noticed me.'  The lower orders  seemed beside themselves, they made bonfires of everything.  The porters  and the Swiss burned the poles of the chairs, and even the floorings and  wainscots intended for the great gallery.  Bontemps, in wrath, ran and  told the king, who burst out laughing and said, 'Let them be; we will  have other floorings.'\"    The least clear-sighted were beginning to discern the modest beams of a  rising sun.  Madame de Montespan, who had a taste for intellectual  things, had not long since recommended Racine and Boileau to the king to  write a history of his reign.  They had been appointed historiographers.  \"When they had done some interesting piece,\" says Louis Racine in his  Memoires, \"they used to go and read it to the king at Madame de  Montespan's.  Madame de Maintenon was generally present at the reading.  She, according to Boileau's account, liked my father better than him, and  Madame de Montespan, on the contrary, liked Boileau better than my  father, but they always paid their court jointly, without any jealousy  between them.  When Madame de Montespan would let fall some rather tart  expressions, my father and Boileau, though by no means sharp-sighted,  observed that the king, without answering her, looked with a smile at  Madame de Maintenon, who was seated opposite to him on a stool, and who  finally disappeared all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12014"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume IV. (#3)"],[1,"all the bitterness of wit she was mistress of, with such  malice, and ill-nature, that she was hated, not only by all the world,  but by her own children and servants: The extremes of prodigality,  and covetousness, of love, and hatred, of dotage, and fondness, met  in her. A woman of this temper will be at no loss for the means of  effecting any one's ruin, and having now conceived an aversion to our  poetess, she was resolved to drive her from her house, with as much  reproach as possible; and accordingly gave out, that she had detected  Mrs. Manley in an intrigue with her own son, and as she did not care  to give encouragement to such amours, she thought proper to discharge  her. Whether or not there was any truth in this charge, it is  impossible for us to determine: But if Mrs. Manley's own word may be  taken, in such a case, she was perfectly innocent thereof.    When our authoress was dismissed by the duchess, she was sollicited by  lieutenant-general Tidcomb, to pass some time with him at his country  seat; but she excused herself by telling him, she must be in love with  a man, before she could think of residing with him, which she could  not, without a violation of truth, profess for him. She told him her  love of solitude was improved, by her disgust of the world, and  since it was impossible for her to be public with reputation, she was  resolved to remain in it concealed.    It was in this solitude she composed her first tragedy, which was much  more famous for the language, fire, and tenderness, than the conduct.  Mrs. Barry distinguished herself in it, and the author was often heard  to express great surprize, that a man of Mr. Betterton's grave sense,  and judgment, should think well enough of the productions of a young  woman, to bring it upon the stage, since she herself in a more mature  age could hardly bear to read it. But as the play succeeded, she  received such unbounded incense from admirers, that her apartment  was crowded with men of wit, and gaiety. There is a copy of verses  prefixed to her play, said to be written by a very great hand which  deserve notice.      What! all our sex in one sad hour undone?    Lost are our arts, our learning, our renown    Since nature's tide of wit came rolling down.    Keen were your eyes we knew, and sure their darts;    Fire to our soul they send, and passion to our heart!    Needless was an addition to such arms,    When all mankind were vassals to your charms:    That hand but seen, gives wonder and desire,    Snow to the fight, but with its touches fire!    Who sees thy yielding Queen, and would not be    On any terms, the best, the happy he;    Entranc'd we fancy all is extasy.    Quote Ovid, now no more ye am'rous swains,    Delia, than Ovid has more moving strains.    Nature in her alone exceeds all art,    And nature sure does nearest touch the heart.    Oh! might I call the bright discoverer mine,    The whole fair sex unenvied I'd resign;    Give all my happy hours to Delia's charms,    She who by writing thus our wishes warms,    What worlds of love must circle in her arms?    They who had a regard for Mrs. Manley could not but observe with  concern, that her conduct was such, as would soon issue in her ruin.  No language but flattery approached her ear; the Beaux told her, that  a woman of her wit, was not to be confined to the dull formalities of  her own sex, but had a right to assume the unreserved freedom of the  male, since all things were pardonable to a lady, who knew to give  laws to others, yet was not obliged to keep them herself. General  Tidcomb, who seems to have been her sincerest friend, took the  privilege of an old acquaintance to correct her ill taste, and the  wrong turn she gave her judgment, in admitting adulation from such  wretches, whose praise could reflect but little honour, and who would  be ready to boast of favours they never received, nor indeed ever  endeavoured to obtain.    This salutary council was rejected; she told him, that she did not  think fit to reform a conduct, which she reckoned very innocent;  and still continued to receive the whispers of flatterers, 'till  experience taught her the folly of her behaviour, and she lived to  repent her indiscretion.    Her virtue was now nodding, and she was ready to fall into the arms of  any gallant, like mellow fruit, without much trouble in the gathering.  Sir Thomas Skipwith, a character of gaiety of those times, and, who  it seems had theatrical connections, was recommended to her, as being  very able to promote her design in writing for the stage. This knight  was in the 50th year of his age, and in the 60th of his constitution,  when he was first introduced to her, and as he had been a long  practised gallant, he soon made addresses to her, and whether or no  this knight, who was more dangerous to a woman's reputation, than her  virtue, was favoured by her, the world was so much convinced of it,  that her character was now absolutely lost. Sir Thomas was a weak,  vain, conceited coxcomb, who delighted in boasting of his conquests  over women, and what was often owing to his fortune, and station in  life, he imputed to his address, and the elegance of his manner, of  both which he was totally destitute. He even published Mrs. Manley's  dishonour, and from that time our sprightly poetess was considered, by  the sober part of the sex, quite abandoned to all shame.    When her affair with this superannuated knight was over, she soon  engaged in another intrigue, still more prejudicial to her character;  for it was with a married man, one Mr. Tilly, a gentleman of the Law;  with whom she lived a considerable time: while he underwent at  home many of those severe lectures, which the just provocation, and  jealousy of his wife taught her to read him. Mrs. Tilly at last died,  and our gallant was left at his freedom to marry the object of his  passion; but unluckily his finances were in such a situation, that he  was obliged to repair them by marrying a woman of fortune. This was a  cruel circumstance; for he really loved, and doated upon Mrs. Manley,  and had the felicity of a reciprocal passion. She agreed however, in  order to repair his fortune, that he should marry a rich young widow,  whom he soon won by the elegance of his address, while our authoress  retired into the country to spend her days in solitude and sorrow, and  bid an everlasting farewel to the pleasures of love and gallantry.  Mr. Tilly did not many years survive this reparation: his life was  rendered miserable at home by the jealousy of his young wife, who had  heard of his affair with Mrs. Manley; he lost his senses, and died in  a deplorable situation.    During her retirement, our authoress, who had a most confirmed  aversion to the Whig ministry, wrote her Atalantis, which was meant as  a representation of the characters of some of those, who had effected  the Revolution. A warrant was granted from the secretary of state's  office, to seize the Printer and Publisher of these volumes. This  circumstance reduced the writer to a very troublesome dilemma; she  could not bear the thoughts that innocent people should suffer on her  account, and she judged it cruel to remain concealed, while they who  were only inferior instruments, were suffering for her. She consulted,  on this occasion, her best friend, general Tidcomb, who, after  rallying her for exposing people, who had never in particular injured  her, he advised her to go into France, and made her an offer of  his purse for that purpose. This advice she rejected, and came to  a determined resolution, that no person should ever suffer on her  account. The general asked her, how she should like to be confined in  Newgate? to which she answered, that she would rather lye in a prison,  after having discharged her conference, than riot in a palace under  its reproaches. The general upon this replied, that these things  sounded very heroic, but there was a great difference between real and  imaginary sufferings, 'that she had chosen to declare herself for the  Tories, a party, who never could keep their own, nor other people's  secrets, and were ever forgetful of such as served them; that the most  severe critics upon the Tory writings, were the Tories themselves, who  never considering the design, or honest intention of the author, would  examine the performance only, and that too with as much severity,  as they would an enemy's, and at the same time value themselves  upon being impartial against their friends. Then as to gratitude,  or generosity, the Tories did not approach to the Whigs, who never  suffered any man to go unrewarded, however dull, or insignificant,  provided he declared himself to be for them; whereas the Tories had no  general interest, and consequently no particular, each person refusing  to contribute towards the benefit of the whole; and if it should  happen, that she should perish, through want, in a Jail, they would  sooner condemn her folly, than pity her sufferings.'    This did not deter our poetess from voluntarily preferring herself  before the Court of King's Bench, as the author of the Atalantis.    When she was examined before the secretary (then lord Sunderland)  he was assiduous to know from whom she had got information of some  particulars, which they imagined were above her own intelligence. Her  defence was with much humility and sorrow, at the same time denying  that any persons were concerned with her, or that she had a farther  design than writing for her own amusement, and diversion in the  country, without intending particular reflexions, or characters; when  this was not believed, and the contrary urged against her by several  circumstances, she said, 'then it must be by inspiration, because  knowing her own innocence, she could account for it no other way.' The  secretary replied, 'that inspiration used to be upon a good account,  and her writings were stark naught.' She, with an air of"]]]
