VOCABULARY    As this book presupposes a knowledge of elementary grammar, pronouns,  numerals, the common prepositions, and modal and auxiliary verbs are not  given. Of strong verbs only the vowel change, including the quantity when  different from the infinitive, is indicated, unless the verb shows  further irregularities. Intransitive verbs that take _sein_ contrary to  rule are marked with 's'. The prefix of separable verbs is followed by -.  Of nouns only the plural is given, unless they belong to the so-called  mixed declension. Compound words whose meaning is readily discernible  from the component parts, are not included.      [Transcriber's note: In the original, there are no commas between the  German word (printed in bold type) and its English translation in simple  definitions. Bold type is usually rendered as ALL CAPS in PG e-texts, but  since the meaning of German words can depend on their capitalization  (e.g. 'arm' and 'Arm' mean different things) I have added commas instead  to make the vocabulary more easily understandable. Short vowels are  marked with [s], long vowels with [l].

Cuoq, of  Bruyas, and of Mr. Wright, supplemented by the researches of the author,  pursued at intervals during several years, among the tribes of Western  Canada and New York. Only a very brief sketch of the subject can here be  given. It is not too much to say that a complete grammar of any Iroquois  language would be at least as extensive as the best Greek or Sanscrit  grammar. For such a work neither the writer, nor perhaps any other  person now living, except M. Cuoq himself, would be competent.    The phonology of the language is at once simple and perplexing.  According to M. Cuoq, twelve letters suffice to represent it: _a, c, f,  h, i, k, n, o, r, s, t, w_. Mr. Wright employs for the Seneca seventeen,  with diacritical marks, which raise the number to twenty-one. The  English missionaries among the Mohawks found sixteen letters sufficient,  _a, d, e, g, h, i, j, k, n, o, r, s, t, u, w, y._ There are no labial  sounds, unless the _f_, which rarely occurs, and appears to be merely an  aspirated _w_, may be considered one. No definite distinction is  maintained between the vowel sounds _o_ and _u_, and one of these  letters may be dispensed with. The distinction between hard and soft (or  surd and sonant) mutes is not preserved. The sounds of _d_ and _t_, and  those of _k_ and _g_, are interchangeable. So also are those of _l_ and  _r_, the former sound being heard more frequently in the Oneida dialect  and the latter in the Canienga. From the Western dialects,--the  Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca,--this _l_ or _r_ sound has, in modern  times, disappeared altogether. The Canienga _konoronkwa_, I esteem him  (in Oneida usually sounded _konolonkwa_), has become _konoenkwa_ in  Onondaga,--and in Cayuga and Seneca is contracted to _kononkwa_.  Aspirates and aspirated gutturals abound, and have been variously  represented by _h, hh, kh_, and _gh_, and sometimes (in the works of the  early French missionaries) by the Greek [Greek: chi] and the _spiritus  asper_. Yet no permanent distinction appears to be maintained among the  sounds thus represented, and M. Cuoq reduces them all to the simple _h_.  The French nasal sound abounds. M. Cuoq and the earlier English  missionaries have expressed it, as in French, simply by the _n_ when  terminating a syllable. When it does not close a syllable, a diaeresis  above the n, or else the Spanish _tilde (n)_ indicates the sound. Mr.  Wright denotes it by a line under the vowel. The later English  missionaries express it by a diphthong: _ken_ becomes _kea; nonwa_  becomes _noewa_; _onghwentsya_ is written _oughweatsya_.    A strict analysis would probably reduce the sounds of the Canienga  language to seven consonants, _h, k, n, r, s, t,_ and _w_, and four  vowels, _a, e, i_, and _o_, of which three, _a, e, and o_, may receive a  nasal sound. This nasalizing makes them, in fact, distinct elements; and  the primary sounds of the language may therefore be reckoned at  fourteen. [Footnote: A dental _t_, which the French missionaries  represent sometimes by the Greek _theta_ and sometimes by _th_, and  which the English have also occasionally expressed by the latter method,  may possibly furnish an additional element. The Greek _theta_ of the  former is simply the English _w_.] The absence of labials and the  frequent aspirated gutturals give to the utterance of the best speakers  a deep and sonorous character which reminds the hearer of the stately  Castilian speech.    The \"Book of Rites,\" or, rather, the Canienga portion of it, is written  in the orthography first employed by the English missionaries. The _d_  is frequently used, and must be regarded merely as a variant of the _t_  sound. The _g_ is sometimes, though rarely, employed as a variant of the  _k_. The digraph _gh_ is common and represents the guttural aspirate,  which in German is indicated by _ch_ and in Spanish by _j_. The French  missionaries write it now simply _h_, and consider it merely a harsh  pronunciation of the aspirate. The _j_ is sounded as in English; it  usually represents a complex sound, which might be analysed into _ts_ or  _tsi_; _jathondek_ is properly _tsiatontek_. The _x_, which occasionally  appears, is to be pronounced _ks_, as in English. _An, en, on_, when not  followed by a vowel, have a nasal sound, as in French. This sound is  heard even when those syllables are followed by another _n_. Thus  _Kanonsionni_ is pronounced as if written _Kanonsionni_ and _yondennase_  as if written _yondennase_. The vowels have usually the same sound as in  German and Italian; but in the nasal _en_ the vowel has an obscure  sound, nearly like that of the short _u_ in _but_. Thus _yondennase_  sounds almost as if written _yondunnase_, and _kanienke_ is pronounced  nearly like _kaniunke_.    The nouns in Iroquois are varied, but with accidence differing from the  Aryan and Semitic variations, some of the distinctions being more  subtle, and, so to speak, metaphysical. The dual is expressed by  prefixing the particle _te_, and suffixing _ke_ to the noun; thus, from  _kanonsa_, house, we have _tekanonsake_, two houses. These syllables, or  at least the first, are supposed to be derived from _tekeni_, two. The  plural, when it follows an adjective expressive of number, is indicated  by the syllable _ni_ prefixed to the noun, and _ke_ suffixed; as, _eso  nikanonsake_, many houses. In other cases the plural is sometimes  expressed by one of the words _okon_ (or _hokon_) _okonha_, _son_ and  _sonha_, following the noun. In general, however, the plural  significance of nouns is left to be inferred from the context, the verb  always and the adjective frequently indicating it.    All beings are divided into two classes, which do not correspond either  with the Aryan genders or with the distinctions of animate and inanimate  which prevail in the Algonkin tongues. These classes have been styled  noble and common. To the noble belong male human beings and deities. The  other class comprises women and all other objects. It seems probable,  however, that the distinction in the first instance was merely that of  sex,--that it was, in fact, a true gender. Deities, being regarded as  male, were included in the masculine gender. There being no neuter form,  the feminine gender was extended, and made to comprise all other beings.  These classes, however, are not indicated by any change in the noun, but  merely by the forms of the pronoun and the verb.    The local relations of nouns are expressed by affixed particles, such as  _ke_, _ne_, _kon_, _akon_, _akta._ Thus, from _ononta_ mountain, we have  _onontake_, at (or to) the mountain; from _akehrat_, dish, _akehratne_,  in (or on) the dish; from _kanonsa_, house, _kanonsakon_, or  _kanonskon_, in the house, _kanonsokon_, under the house, and  _kanonsakta_, near the house. These locative particles, it will be seen,  usually, though not always, draw the accent towards them.    The most peculiar and perplexing variation is that made by what is  termed the \"crement,\" affixed to many (though not all) nouns. This  crement in the Canienga takes various forms, _ta, sera, tsera, kwa._  _Onkwe_, man, becomes _onkweta_; _otkon_, spirit, _otkonsera_; _akawe_,  oar, _akawetsera_; _ahta_, shoe, _ahhtakwa_. The crement is employed  when the noun is used with numeral adjectives, when it has adjective or  other affixes, and generally when it enters into composition with other  words. Thus _onkwe_, man, combined with the adjective termination _iyo_  (from the obsolete _wiyo_, good) becomes _onkwetiyo_, good man. _Wenni_,  day, becomes in the plural _niate_ _niwenniserake_, many days, etc. The  change, however, is not grammatical merely, but conveys a peculiar shade  of meaning difficult to define. The noun, according to M. Cuoq, passes  from a general and determinate to a special and restricted sense.  _Onkwe_ means man in general; _asen nionkwetake_, three men (in  particular.) One interpreter rendered _akawetsera_, \"the oar itself.\"  The affix _sera_ or _tsera_ seems to be employed to form what we should  term abstract nouns, though to the Iroquois mind they apparently present  themselves as possessing a restricted or specialized sense. Thus from  _iotarihen_, it is warm, we have _otarihensera_, heat; from _wakeriat_,  to be brave, _ateriatitsera_, courage. So _kakweniatsera_, authority;  _kanaiesera_, pride; _kanakwensera_, anger. Words of this class abound  in the Iroquois; so little ground is there for the common opinion that  the language is destitute of abstract nouns. [Footnote: See, on this  point, the remarks of Dr Brinton to the same effect, in regard to the  Aztec, Qquichua, and other languages, with interesting illustrations, in  his _\"American Hero Myths\"_, p. 25]    The adjective, when employed in an isolated form, follows the  substantive; as _kanonsa kowa_, large house; _onkwe honwe_ (or _onwe_) a  real man. But, in general, the substantive and the adjective coalesce in  one word. _Ase_ signifies new, and added to _kanonsa_ gives us  _kanonsase_, new house. Karonta, tree, and _kowa_, or _kowanen_, great,  make together _karontowanen_, great tree. Frequently the affixed  adjective is never employed as an isolated word. The termination _iyo_  (or _iio_) expresses good or beautiful, and _aksen_, bad or ugly; thus  _kanonsiyo_, fine house, _kanonsasken_, ugly house. These compound forms  frequently make their plural by adding _s_, as _kanonsiyos_,  _kanonsaksens_.    The pronouns are more numerous than in any European language, and show  clearer distinctions in meaning. Thus, in the singular, besides the  ordinary pronouns, I, thou, he and she, the language possesses an  indeterminate form,"]]]
