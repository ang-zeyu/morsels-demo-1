I think there was a veranda, but I'm forgettin'.    \"'Will ye not step in?' sez Dinah, pretty and polite, though the Shadds  had no dealin's with the Sheehys. Old Mother Shadd looked up quick, an'  she was the fust to see the throuble; for Dinah was her daughter.    \"'I'm pressed for time to-day,' sez Judy as bould as brass; 'an' I've only  come for Terence,--my promust man. Tis strange to find him here the day  afther the day.'    \"Dinah looked at me as though I had hit her, an' I answered straight.    \"'There was some nonsinse last night at the Sheehys' quarthers, an' Judy's  carryin' on the joke, darlin',' sez I.    \"'At the Sheehys' quarthers?' sez Dinah very slow, an' Judy cut in wid:  'He was there from nine till ten, Dinah Shadd, an' the betther half av  that time I was sittin' on his knee, Dinah Shadd. Ye may look and ye may  look an' ye may look me up an' down, but ye won't look away that Terence  is my promust man, Terence, darlin', 'tis time for us to be comin' home.'    \"Dinah Shadd niver said word to Judy. 'Ye left me at half-past eight,' she  sez to me, 'an' I niver thought that ye'd leave me for Judy,--promises, or  no promises. Go back wid her, you that have to be fetched by a girl! I'm  done with you,' sez she, and she ran into her own room, her mother  followin'. So I was alone wid those two women and at liberty to spake my  sentiments.    \"'Judy Sheehy,' sez I, 'if you made a fool av me betune the lights you  shall not do ut in the day. I niver promised you words or lines.'    \"'You lie,' sez ould Mother Sheehy, 'an' may ut choke you waere you  stand!' She was far gone in dhrink.    \"'An' tho' ut choked me where I stud I'd not change,' sez I. 'Go home,  Judy. I take shame for a decent girl like you dhraggin' your mother out  bareheaded on this errand. Hear now, and have ut for an answer. I gave my  word to Dinah Shadd yesterday, an', more blame to me, I was wid you last  night talkin' nonsinse but nothin' more. You've chosen to thry to hould me  on ut. I will not be held thereby for anythin' in the world. Is that  enough?'    \"Judy wint pink all over. 'An' I wish you joy av the perjury,' sez she,  duckin' a curtsey. 'You've lost a woman that would ha' wore her hand to  the bone for your pleasure; an' 'deed, Terence, ye were not thrapped....'  Lascelles must ha' spoken plain to her. 'I am such as Dinah is--'deed I  am! Ye've lost a fool av a girl that'll niver look at you again, an' ye've  lost what ye niver had,--your common honesty. If you manage your men as  you manage your love-makin', small wondher they call you the worst  corp'ril in the comp'ny. Come away, mother,' sez she.    \"But divil a fut would the ould woman budge! 'D'you hould by that?' sez  she, peerin' up under her thick grey eyebrows.    \"'Ay, an wud,' sez I, 'tho' Dinah give me the go twinty times. I'll have  no thruck with you or yours,' sez I. 'Take your child away, ye shameless  woman.'    \"'An' am I shameless?' sez she, bringin' her hands up above her head.  'Thin what are you, ye lyin', schamin', weak-kneed, dhirty-souled son av a  sutler? Am _I_ shameless? Who put the open shame on me an' my child that  we shud go beggin' through the lines in the broad daylight for the broken  word of a man? Double portion of my shame be on you, Terence Mulvaney,  that think yourself so strong! By Mary and the saints, by blood and water  an' by ivry sorrow that came into the world since the beginnin', the black  blight fall on you and yours, so that you may niver be free from pain for  another when ut's not your own! May your heart bleed in your breast drop  by drop wid all your friends laughin' at the bleedin'! Strong you think  yourself? May your strength be a curse to you to dhrive you into the  divil's hands against your own will! Clear-eyed you are? May your eyes see  dear evry step av the dark path you take till the hot cindhers av hell put  thim out! May the ragin' dry thirst in my own ould bones go to you that  you shall niver pass bottle full nor glass empty. God preserve the light  av your onder-standin' to you, my jewel av a bhoy, that ye may niver  forget what you mint to be an' do, whin you're wallowin' in the muck! May  ye see the betther and follow the worse as long as there's breath in your  body; an' may ye die quick in a strange land; watchin' your death before  ut takes you, an' onable to stir hand or foot!'    \"I heard a scufflin' in the room behind, and thin Dinah Shadd's hand  dhropped into mine like a rose-leaf into a muddy road.    \"'The half av that I'll take,' sez she, 'an' more too if I can. Go home,  ye silly talkin' woman,--go home an' confess.'    \"'Come away! Come away!' sez Judy, pullin' her mother by the shawl. ''Twas  none av Terence's fault. For the love av Mary stop the talkin'!'    \"'An' you!' said ould Mother Sheehy, spinnin' round forninst Dinah. 'Will  ye take the half av that man's load? Stand off from him, Dinah Shadd,  before he takes you down too--you that look to be a quarther-master-  sergeant's wife in five years. You look too high, child. You shall _wash_  for the quarther-master-sergeant, whin he plases to give you the job out  av charity; but a privit's wife you shall be to the end, an' evry sorrow  of a privit's wife you shall know and nivir a joy but wan, that shall go  from you like the running tide from a rock. The pain av bearin' you shall  know but niver the pleasure av giving the breast; an' you shall put away  a man-child into the common ground wid never a priest to say a prayer over  him, an' on that man-child ye shall think ivry day av your life. Think  long, Dinah Shadd, for you'll niver have another tho' you pray till your  knees are bleedin'. The mothers av childer shall mock you behind your back  when you're wringing over the washtub. You shall know what ut is to help a  dhrunken husband home an' see him go to the gyard-room. Will that plase  you, Dinah Shadd, that won't be seen talkin' to my daughter? You shall  talk to worse than Judy before all's over. The sergints' wives shall look  down on you contemptuous, daughter av a sergint, an' you shall cover ut  all up wid a smiling face when your heart's burstin'. Stand off av him,  Dinah Shadd, for I've put the Black Curse of Shielygh upon him an' his own  mouth shall make ut good.\"    \"She pitched forward on her head an' began foamin' at the mouth. Dinah  Shadd ran out wid water, an' Judy dhragged the ould woman into the veranda  till she sat up.    \"'I'm old an' forlore,' she sez, thremblin' an' cryin', 'and 'tis like I  say a dale more than I mane.'    \"'When you're able to walk,--go,' says ould Mother Shadd. 'This house has  no place for the likes av you that have cursed my daughter.'    \"'Eyah!' said the ould woman. 'Hard words break no bones, an' Dinah Shadd  'll keep the love av her husband till my bones are green corn, Judy  darlin', I misremember what I came here for. Can you lend us the bottom av  a taycup av tay, Mrs. Shadd?'    \"But Judy dhragged her off cryin' as tho' her heart wud break. An' Dinah  Shadd an' I, in ten minutes we had forgot ut all.\"    \"Then why do you remember it now?\" said I.    \"Is ut like I'd forget? Ivry word that wicked ould woman spoke fell thrue  in my life aftherward, an' I cud ha' stud ut all--stud ut all--excipt when  my little Shadd was born. That was on the line av march three months  afther the regiment was taken with cholera. We were betune Umballa an'  Kalka thin, an' I was on picket. Whin I came off duty the women showed me  the child, an' ut turned on uts side an' died as I looked. We buried him  by the road, an' Father Victor was a day's march behind wid the heavy  baggage, so the comp'ny captain read a prayer. An' since then I've been a  childless man, an' all else that ould Mother Sheehy put upon me an' Dinah  Shadd. What do you think, sorr?\"    I thought a good deal, but it seemed better then to reach out for  Mulvaney's hand. The demonstration nearly cost me the use of three  fingers. Whatever he knows of his weaknesses, Mulvaney is entirely  ignorant of his strength.    \"But what do you think?\" he repeated, as I was straightening out the  crushed fingers.    My reply was drowned in yells and outcries from the next fire, where ten  men were shouting for \"Orth'ris,\" \"Privit Orth'ris,\" \"Mistah  Or--ther--ris!\" \"Deah boy,\" \"Cap'n Orth'ris,\" \"Field-Marshal Orth'ris,\"  \"Stanley, you pen'north o' pop, come 'ere to your own comp'ny!\" And the  cockney, who had been delighting another audience with recondite and  Rabelaisian yarns, was shot down among his admirers by the major force.    \"You've crumpled my dress-shirt 'orrid,\" said he, \"an' I shan't sing no  more to this 'ere bloomin' drawin'-room.\"    Learoyd, roused by the confusion, uncoiled himself, crept behind Ortheris,  and slung him aloft on his shoulders.    \"Sing, ye bloomin' hummin' bird!\" said he, and Ortheris, beating time on  Learoyd's skull, delivered himself, in the raucous voice of the Ratcliffe  Highway, of this song:--       My girl she give me the go onst,       When I was a London lad,     An' I went on the drink for a fortnight,       An' then I went to the bad.     The Queen she give me a shillin'       To fight for 'er over the seas;     But Guv'ment built me a fever-trap,       An' Injia give me disease.    _Chorus._       Ho! don't you 'eed what a girl says,       An' don't you go for the beer;     But I was an ass when I was at grass,       An' that is why I'm here.

Brooks's account of the story is that the conference  took place, the Jews were vanquished, and in revenge poisoned the champion  of Christianity afterwards. Dexter most unromantically throws cold water on  this poisoning story, and adduces much circumstantial testimony to prove  its improbability; but it could hardly have been invented in cold blood by  the Puritan historians, and must have had some foundation in truth. And  since he is dead, and the thought cannot harm him, I may acknowledge that I  firmly believe and I like to believe that he died in so romantic a way.    The Puritans were psalm-singers ever; and in Holland the Brownist division  of the church came under strong influences from Geneva and Wittenberg, the  birth-places of psalm-singing, that made them doubly fond of \"worship in  song.\" Hence the Pilgrim Fathers, Brewster, Bradford, Carver, and Standish,  for love of music as well as in affectionate testimony to their old pastor  and friend, brought to the New World copies of his version of the Psalms  and sang from it with delight and profit to themselves, if not with ease  and elegance.    Dexter says very mildly of Ainsworth's literary work that \"there are  diversities of gifts, and it is no offence to his memory to conclude that  he shone more as an exegete than as a poet.\" Poesy is a gift of the gods  and cometh not from deep Hebrew study nor from vast learning, and we must  accept Ainsworth's pious enthusiasm in the place of poetic fervor. Of the  quality of his work, however, it is best to judge for one's self. Here is  his rendition of the Nineteenth Psalm, so well known to us in verse by  Addison's glorious \"The spacious firmament on high.\" The prose version is  printed in one column and the verse by its side.        1. To the Mayster of the Musik: A Psalm of David        2. The heavens, doo tel the glory of God: and the out-spred firmament      shevveth; the work of his hand.        3. Day unto day uttereth speech: and night unto night manifesteth      knowledge:        4. No speech, and no words: not heard is their voice        5. Through all the earth, gone-forth is their line: and unto the      utmost-end of the world their speakings: he hath put a tent in them for      the sun.        6. And he; as a bridegroom, going-forth out of his privy-chamber:      joyes as a mighty-man to run a race        7. From the utmost end of the heavens is his egress; and his      compassing-regress is unto the utmost-ends of them: and none _is_      hidd, from his heat.        2. The heav'ne, doo tel the glory of God and his firmament dooth      preach.        3. work of his hands. Day unto day dooth largely-utter speach and night      unto night dooth knowledge shew        4. No speach, and words are none.        5. thier voice it-is not heard. Thier line through all the earth is      gone: and to the worlds end, thier speakings: in them he did dispose,        6. tent for the Sun. Who-bride-groom-like out of his chamber goes:      joyes strong-man-like, to run a race        7. From heav'ns end, his egress: and his regress to the end of them      hidd from his heat, none is:    In order to show the proportion of annotation in the book, and to indicate  the mental traits of the author, let me state that this psalm, in both  prose and metrical versions, occupies about one page; while the closely  printed annotations fill over three pages; which is hardly \"explaining with  brevitie,\" as Ainsworth says in his preface. With this psalm the notes  commence thus:--    \"2. (the out-spred-firmament) the whole cope of heaven, with the aier which  though it be soft and liquid and spred over the Earth, yet it is fast and  firm and therefore called of us according to the common Greek version a  firmament: the holy Ghost expresseth it by another term Mid-heaven.  This out-spred-firmament of expansion God made amidds the waters for a  separation and named it Heaven, which of David is said to be stretched out  as courtayn and elsewhere is said to be as firm as moulten glass. So under  this name firmament be commised the orbs of the heav'ns and the aier and  the whole spacious country above the earth.\"    These annotations must have formed to the Pilgrims not only a dictionary  but a perfect encyclopaedia of useful knowledge. Things spiritual and things  temporal were explained therein. Scientific, historic, and religious  information were dispensed impartially. Much and varied instruction was  given in Natural History, though viewed of course from a strictly religious  point of view. The little Pilgrims learned from their Psalm-Book that the  \"Leviathan is the great whalefish or seadragon, so called of the fast  joyning together of his scales as he is described Job 40: 20, 41 and  is used to resemble great tyrants.\" They also learned that \"Lions of  sundry-kinds have sundry-names. Tear-in-pieces like a lion. That he ravin  not, make-a-prey; called a plueker Renter or Tearer, and elsewhere Laby  that is, Harty and couragious; Kphir, this lurking, Couchant. The reason  of thier names is shewed, as The renting-lion as greedy to tear, and the  lurking-Lion as biding in covert places. Other names are also given to this  kind as Shachal, of ramping, of fierce nature; and Lajith of subduing his  prey. Psalm LVI Lions called here Lebain, harty, stowt couragious, Lions.  Lions are mentioned in the Scriptures for the stowtness of thier hart,  boldnes, and grimnes of thier countenance.\"    Here are other annotations taken at hap-hazard. The lines,      \"Al they that doo upon me look      a scoff at me doe make    they with the lip do make-a-mow      the head they scornful-shake,\"    Ainsworth thus explains: \"Make-a-mow, making-an-opening with the lip  which may be taken both for mowing and thrusting out of the lip and for  licentious opening thereof to speak reproach.\" The expression \"Keep thou me  as the black of the apple of the eye\" is thus annotated: \"The black, that  is, the sight in the midds of the eye wherein appeareth the resemblance of  a little man, and thereupon seemeth to be called in Hebrew Ishon which is a  man. And as that part is blackish so this word is also used for other black  things as the blackness of night. The apple so we call that which the  Hebrew here calleth bath and babath that is the babie or little image  appearing in the eye.\" Anger receives this definition: \"ire, outward in  the face, grauue, grimnes or fiercenes of countenance. The original Aph  signifieth both the nose by which one breatheth, and Anger which appeareth  in the snuffing or breathing of the nose.\"    Before the Holland exiles had this version of Ainsworth's to sing from,  they used the book known as \"Sternhold and Hopkins' Psalms.\" They gave it  up gladly to show honor to the work of their loved pastor, and perhaps also  with a sense of pleasure in not having to sing any verses which had been  used and authorized by the Church of England. In doing this they had to  abandon, however, such spirited lines as Sternhold's--      \"The earth did shake, for feare did quake      the hills their bases shook.    Removed they were, in place most fayre      at God's right fearfull looks.      \"He rode on hye, and did soe flye      Upon the cherubins    He came in sight and made his flight      Upon the winges of windes.\"    They sung instead,--      \"And th' earth did shake and quake and styrred bee    grounds of the mount: & shook for wroth was hee    Smoke mounted, in his wrath, fyre did eat    out of his mouth: from it burned-with heat.\"    Alas, poor Priscilla! how could she sing with ease or reverence such  confused verses? The tune, too, set in the psalm-book seems absolutely  unfitted to the metre. I fear when she sang from the pages \"the old Puritan  anthem\" that she was forced to turn it into a chant, else the irregular  lines could never have been brought within the compass of the melody; and  yet, the metre is certainly better than the sense.    It may be thought that these selections of the Psalms have been chosen for  their crudeness and grotesqueness. I have tried in vain to find othersome  that would show more elegant finish or more of the spirit of poetry; the  most poetical lines I can discover are these, which are beautiful for the  reason that the noble thoughts of the Psalmist cannot be hidden, even by  the wording of the learned Puritan minister:--        1. Jehovah feedeth me: I shall not lack        2. In grassy fields, he downe dooth make me lye: he gently-leads mee,      quiet-Waters by.        3. He dooth return my soul: for his name-sake in paths of justice      leads-me-quietly.        4. Yea, though I walk in dale of deadly-shade ile fear none yll, for      with me thou wilt be thy rod, thy staff eke, they shall comfort mee.    But few of these psalm-books of Ainsworth are now in existence; but few  indeed came to New England. Elder Brewster owned one, as is shown by  the inventory of the books in his library. Not every member of the  congregation, not every family possessed one; many were too poor, many  \"lacked skill to read,\" and in some communities only one psalm-book was  owned in the entire church. Hence arose the odious custom of \"deaconing\" or  \"lining\" the psalm, by which each line was read separately by the deacon or  elder and then sung by the congregation. There is no doubt, however,  that this Ainsworth's Version was used in many of the early New England  meetings. Reverend Thomas Symmes, in his \"Joco-Serious Dialogue,\" printed  in 1723, wrote: \"Furthermore the Church"]]]
