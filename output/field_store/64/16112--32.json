Apparently the thief had taken hold of the parcel, with the paper on it,  and the paper had afterwards dropped off and fallen with the marked  surface downwards--probably when the parcel was transferred to the other  hand.\"    \"You mentioned,\" said Thorndyke, \"that the experts at Scotland Yard have  identified this thumb-mark as that of Mr. Reuben Hornby. May I ask how  they came to have the opportunity of making the comparison?\"    \"Ah!\" said Mr. Lawley. \"Thereby hangs a very curious tale of  coincidences. The police, of course, when they found that there was so  simple a means of identification as a thumb-mark, wished to take  thumb-prints of all the employees in the works; but this Mr. Hornby  refused to sanction--rather quixotically, as it seems to me--saying that  he would not allow his nephews to be subjected to such an indignity. Now  it was, naturally, these nephews in whom the police were chiefly  interested, seeing that they alone had had the handling of the keys, and  considerable pressure was brought to bear upon Mr. Hornby to have the  thumb-prints taken.    \"However, he was obdurate, scouting the idea of any suspicion attaching  to either of the gentlemen in whom he had reposed such complete  confidence and whom he had known all their lives, and so the matter  would probably have remained a mystery but for a very odd circumstance.    \"You may have seen on the bookstalls and in shop windows an appliance  called a 'Thumbograph,' or some such name, consisting of a small book of  blank paper for collecting the thumb-prints of one's friends, together  with an inking pad.\"    \"I have seen those devices of the Evil One,\" said Thorndyke, \"in fact, I  have one, which I bought at Charing Cross Station.\"    \"Well, it seems that some months ago Mrs. Hornby, the wife of John  Hornby, purchased one of these toys--\"    \"As a matter of fact,\" interrupted Reuben, \"it was my cousin Walter who  bought the thing and gave it to her.\"    \"Well, that is not material,\" said Mr. Lawley (though I observed that  Thorndyke made a note of the fact in his book); \"at any rate, Mrs.  Hornby became possessed of one of these appliances and proceeded to fill  it with the thumb-prints of her friends, including her two nephews. Now  it happened that the detective in charge of this case called yesterday  at Mr. Hornby's house when the latter was absent from home, and took the  opportunity of urging her to induce her husband to consent to have the  thumb-prints of her nephews taken for the inspection of the experts at  Scotland Yard. He pointed out that the procedure was really necessary,  not only in the interests of justice but in the interests of the young  men themselves, who were regarded with considerable suspicion by the  police, which suspicion would be completely removed if it could be shown  by actual comparison that the thumb-print could not have been made by  either of them. Moreover, it seemed that both the young men had  expressed their willingness to have the test applied, but had been  forbidden by their uncle. Then Mrs. Hornby had a brilliant idea. She  suddenly remembered the 'Thumbograph,' and thinking to set the question  at rest once for all, fetched the little book and showed it to the  detective. It contained the prints of both thumbs of Mr. Reuben (among  others), and, as the detective had with him a photograph of the  incriminating mark, the comparison was made then and there; and you may  imagine Mrs. Hornby's horror and amazement when it was made clear that  the print of her nephew Reuben's left thumb corresponded in every  particular with the thumb-print that was found in the safe.    \"At this juncture Mr. Hornby arrived on the scene and was, of course,  overwhelmed with consternation at the turn events had taken. He would  have liked to let the matter drop and make good the loss of the diamonds  out of his own funds, but, as that would have amounted practically to  compounding a felony, he had no choice but to prosecute. As a result, a  warrant was issued for the arrest of Mr. Reuben, and was executed this  morning, and my client was taken forthwith to Bow Street and charged  with the robbery.\"    \"Was any evidence taken?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"No. Only evidence of arrest. The prisoner is remanded for a week, bail  having been accepted in two sureties of five hundred pounds each.\"    Thorndyke was silent for a space after the conclusion of the narrative.  Like me, he was evidently not agreeably impressed by the lawyer's  manner, which seemed to take his client's guilt for granted, a position  indeed not entirely without excuse having regard to the circumstances of  the case.    \"What have you advised your client to do?\" Thorndyke asked presently.    \"I have recommended him to plead guilty and throw himself on the  clemency of the court as a first offender. You must see for yourself  that there is no defence possible.\"    The young man flushed crimson, but made no remark.    \"But let us be clear how we stand,\" said Thorndyke. \"Are we defending an  innocent man or are we endeavouring to obtain a light sentence for a man  who admits that he is guilty?\"    Mr. Lawley shrugged his shoulders.    \"That question can be best answered by our client himself,\" said he.    Thorndyke directed an inquiring glance at Reuben Hornby, remarking--    \"You are not called upon to incriminate yourself in any way, Mr. Hornby,  but I must know what position you intend to adopt.\"  Here I again  proposed to withdraw, but Reuben interrupted me.    \"There is no need for you to go away, Dr. Jervis,\" he said. \"My position  is that I did not commit this robbery and that I know nothing whatever  about it or about the thumb-print that was found in the safe. I do not,  of course, expect you to believe me in the face of the overwhelming  evidence against me, but I do, nevertheless, declare in the most solemn  manner before God, that I am absolutely innocent of this crime and have  no knowledge of it whatever.\"    \"Then I take it that you did not plead 'guilty'?\" said Thorndyke.    \"Certainly not; and I never will,\" replied Reuben hotly.    \"You would not be the first innocent man, by very many, who has entered  that plea,\" remarked Mr. Lawley. \"It is often the best policy, when the  defence is hopelessly weak.\"    \"It is a policy that will not be adopted by me,\" rejoined Reuben. \"I may  be, and probably shall be, convicted and sentenced, but I shall continue  to maintain my innocence, whatever happens. Do you think,\" he added,  turning to Thorndyke, \"that you can undertake my defence on that  assumption?\"    \"It is the only assumption on which I should agree to undertake the  case,\" replied Thorndyke.    \"And--if I may ask the question--\" pursued Reuben anxiously, \"do you  find it possible to conceive that I may really be innocent?\"    \"Certainly I do,\" Thorndyke replied, on which I observed Mr. Lawley's  eyebrows rise perceptibly. \"I am a man of facts, not an advocate, and  if I found it impossible to entertain the hypothesis of your innocence,  I should not be willing to expend time and energy in searching for  evidence to prove it. Nevertheless,\" he continued, seeing the light of  hope break out on the face of the unfortunate young man, \"I must impress  upon you that the case presents enormous difficulties and that we must  be prepared to find them insuperable in spite of all our efforts.\"    \"I expect nothing but a conviction,\" replied Reuben in a calm and  resolute voice, \"and can face it like a man if only you do not take my  guilt for granted, but give me a chance, no matter how small, of making  a defence.\"    \"Everything shall be done that I am capable of doing,\" said Thorndyke;  \"that I can promise you. The long odds against us are themselves a spur  to endeavour, as far as I am concerned. And now, let me ask you, have  you any cuts or scratches on your fingers?\"    Reuben Hornby held out both his hands for my colleague's inspection, and  I noticed that they were powerful and shapely, like the hands of a  skilled craftsman, though faultlessly kept. Thorndyke set on the table a  large condenser such as is used for microscopic work, and taking his  client's hand, brought the bright spot of light to bear on each finger  in succession, examining their tips and the parts around the nails with  the aid of a pocket lens.    \"A fine, capable hand, this,\" said he, regarding the member approvingly,  as he finished his examination, \"but I don't perceive any trace of a  scar on either the right or left. Will you go over them, Jervis? The  robbery took place a fortnight ago, so there has been time for a small  cut or scratch to heal and disappear entirely. Still, the matter is  worth noting.\"    He handed me the lens and I scrutinised every part of each hand without  being able to detect the faintest trace of any recent wound.    \"There is one other matter that must be attended to before you go,\" said  Thorndyke, pressing the electric bell-push by his chair. \"I will take  one or two prints of the left thumb for my own information.\"    In response to the summons, Polton made his appearance from some lair  unknown to me, but presumably the laboratory, and, having received his  instructions, retired, and presently returned carrying a box, which he  laid on the table. From this receptacle Thorndyke drew forth a bright  copper plate mounted on a slab of hard wood, a small printer's roller, a  tube of finger-print ink, and a number of cards with very white and  rather glazed surfaces.    \"Now, Mr. Hornby,\" said he, \"your hands, I see, are beyond criticism as  to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11153"],[0,"No Hero (#3)"],[1,"on now, Duncan--it's going on still!\"    \"Well,\" I added, with all the comfort that my voice would carry, and  which an exaggerated concern seemed to demand: \"well, Catherine, it  can't go very far at his age!\" Nor to this hour can I yet conceive a  sounder saying, in all the circumstances of the case, and with one's  knowledge of the type of lad; but my fate was the common one of  comforters, and I was made speedily and painfully aware that I had now  indeed said the most unfortunate thing.    Catherine did not stamp her foot, but she did everything else required  by tradition of the exasperated lady. Not go far? As if it had not gone  too far already to be tolerated another instant longer than was  necessary!    \"He is making a fool of himself--my boy--my Bob--before a whole  hotelful of sharp eyes and sharper tongues! Is that not far enough for  it to have gone? Duncan, it must be stopped, and stopped at once; but I  am not the one to do it. I would rather it went on,\" cried Catherine  tragically, as though the pit yawned before us all, \"than that his  mother should fly to his rescue before all the world! But a friend might  do it, Duncan--if--\"    Her voice had dropped. I bent my ear.    \"If only,\" she sighed, \"I had a friend who would!\"    Catherine was still looking down when I looked up; but the droop of the  slender body, the humble angle of the cavalier hat, the faint flush  underneath, all formed together a challenge and an appeal which were the  more irresistible for their sweet shamefacedness. Acute consciousness of  the past (I thought), and (I even fancied) some penitence for a wrong by  no means past undoing, were in every sensitive inch of her, as she sat a  suppliant to the old player of that part. And there are emotions of  which the body may be yet more eloquent than the face; there was the  figure of Watts's \"Hope\" drooping over as she drooped, not more lissom  and speaking than her own; just then it caught my eye, and on the spot  it was as though the lute's last string of that sweet masterpiece had  vibrated aloud in Catherine's room.    My hand shook as I reached for my trusty sticks, but I cannot say that  my voice betrayed me when I inquired the name of the Swiss hotel.    \"The Riffel Alp,\" said Catherine--\"above Zermatt, you know.\"    \"I start to-morrow morning,\" I rejoined, \"if that will do.\"    Then Catherine looked up. I cannot describe her look. Transfiguration  were the idle word, but the inadequate, and yet more than one would  scatter the effect of so sudden a burst of human sunlight.    \"Would you really go?\" she cried. \"Do you mean it, Duncan?\"    \"I only wish,\" I replied, \"that it were to Australia.\"    \"But then you would be weeks too late.\"    \"Ah, that's another story! I may be too late as it is.\"    Her brightness clouded on the instant; only a gleam of annoyance pierced  the cloud.    \"Too late for what, may I ask?\"    \"Everything except stopping the banns.\"    \"Please don't talk nonsense, Duncan. Banns at nineteen!\"    \"It is nonsense, I agree; at the same time the minor consequences will  be the hardest to deal with. If they are being talked about, well, they  are being talked about. You know Bob best: suppose he is making a fool  of himself, is he the sort of fellow to stop because one tells him so? I  should say not, from what I know of him, and of you.\"    \"I don't know,\" argued Catherine, looking pleased with her compliment.  \"You used to have quite an influence over him, if you remember.\"    \"That's quite possible; but then he was a small boy, now he is a grown  man.\"    \"But you are a much older one.\"    \"Too old to trust to that.\"    \"And you have been wounded in the war.\"    \"The hotel may be full of wounded officers; if not I might get a little  unworthy purchase there. In any case I'll go. I should have to go  somewhere before many days. It may as well be to that place as to  another. I have heard that the air is glorious; and I'll keep an eye on  Robin, if I can't do anything else.\"    \"That's enough for me,\" cried Catherine, warmly. \"I have sufficient  faith in you to leave all the rest to your own discretion and good sense  and better heart. And I never shall forget it, Duncan, never, never! You  are the one person he wouldn't instantly suspect as an emissary, besides  being the only one I ever--ever trusted well enough to--to take at your  word as I have done.\"    I thought myself that the sentence might have pursued a bolder course  without untruth or necessary complications. Perhaps my conceit was on a  scale with my acknowledged infirmity where Catherine was concerned. But  I did think that there was more than trust in the eyes that now melted  into mine; there was liking at least, and gratitude enough to inspire  one to win infinitely more. I went so far as to take in mine the hand to  which I had dared to aspire in the temerity of my youth; nor shall I  pretend for a moment that the old aspirations had not already mounted to  their old seat in my brain. On the contrary, I was only wondering  whether the honesty of voicing my hopes would nowise counterbalance the  caddishness of the sort of stipulation they might imply.    \"All I ask,\" I was saying to myself, \"is that you will give me another  chance, and take me seriously this time, if I prove myself worthy in the  way you want.\"    But I am glad to think I had not said it when tea came up, and saved a  dangerous situation by breaking an insidious spell.    I stayed another hour at least, and there are few in my memory which  passed more deliciously at the time. In writing of it now I feel that I  have made too little of Catherine Evers, in my anxiety not to make too  much, yet am about to leave her to stand or to fall in the reader's  opinion by such impression as I have already succeeded in creating in  his or her mind. Let me add one word, or two, while yet I may. A  baron's daughter (though you might have known Catherine some time  without knowing that), she had nevertheless married for mere love as a  very young girl, and had been left a widow before the birth of her boy.  I never knew her husband, though we were distant kin, nor yet herself  during the long years through which she mourned him. Catherine Evers was  beginning to recover her interest in the world when first we met; but  she never returned to that identical fold of society in which she had  been born and bred. It was, of course, despite her own performances, a  fold to which the worldly wolf was no stranger; and her trouble had  turned a light-hearted little lady into an eager, intellectual,  speculative being, with a sort of shame for her former estate, and an  undoubted reactionary dislike of dominion and of petty pomp. Of her own  high folk one neither saw nor heard a thing; her friends were the  powerful preachers of most denominations, and one or two only painted or  wrote; for she had been greatly exercised about religion, and somewhat  solaced by the arts.    Of her charm for me, a lad with a sneaking regard for the pen, even when  I buckled on the sword, I need not be too analytical. No doubt about her  kindly interest, in the first instance, in so morbid a curiosity as a  subaltern who cared for books and was prepared to extend his gracious  patronage to pictures. This subaltern had only too much money, and if  the truth be known, only too little honest interest in the career into  which he had allowed himself to drift. An early stage of that career  brought him up to London, where family pressure drove him on a day to  Elm Park Gardens. The rest is easily conceived. Here was a woman, still  young, though some years older than oneself; attractive, intellectual,  amusing, the soul of sympathy, at once a spiritual influence and the  best companion in the world; and for a time, at least, she had taken a  perhaps imprudent interest in a lad whom she so greatly interested  herself, on so many and various accounts. Must you marvel that the  young fool mistook the interest, on both sides, for a more intense  feeling, of which he for one had no experience at the time, and that he  fell by his mistake at a ridiculously early stage of his career?    It is, I grant, more surprising to find the same young man playing Harry  Esmond (at due distance) to the same Lady Castlewood after years in  India and a taste of two wars. But Catherine's room was Catherine's  room, a very haunt of the higher sirens, charged with noble promptings  and forgotten influences and impossible vows. And you will please bear  in mind that as yet I am but setting forth, from this rarefied  atmosphere, upon my invidious mission.          CHAPTER II    THE THEATRE OF WAR      It is a far cry to Zermatt at the best of times, and that is not the  middle of August. The annual rush was at its height, the trains crowded,  the heat of them overpowering. I chose to sit up all night in my corner  of an ordinary compartment, as a lesser evil than the _wagon-lit_ in  which you cannot sit up at all. In the morning one was in Switzerland,  with a black collar, a rusty chin, and a countenance in keeping with its  appointments. It was not as though the night had been beguiled for me by  such considerations as are only proper to the devout pilgrim in his  lady's service.    On the contrary, and to tell the honest truth, I found it quite  impossible to sustain such a serious view of the very special service to  which I was foresworn: the more I thought of it, in one sense, the less  in another, until my only chance was to go forward with grim humour in  the spirit of impersonal curiosity which that attitude induces. In a  word, and the cant one which yet happens to express my state of mind to  a nicety, I had already \"weakened\" on the whole business which I had  been in such a foolish hurry to undertake, though not for one  reactionary moment upon her for whom I had undertaken it. I was still  entirely eager to \"do her behest in pleasure or in pain\"; but this"]]]
