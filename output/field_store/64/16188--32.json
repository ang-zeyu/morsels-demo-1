Volume 19, No. 541, April (#3)"],[1," with gold at one end, and with silver at the other; and although  not _much_ of a snuff-taker, he always carries a box, on the lid of which  smiles the portrait of the once celebrated and beautiful, though now  somewhat forgotten, Duchess of D----, or the equally resplendent Lady  Emily M----.    His table is of the same finish with his wardrobe. If he sat down to  dinner, even when alone, in boots, that visitation which Quin ascribed to  the prevalent neglect of \"pudding on a Sunday\"--an earthquake might be  expected to follow. His spoons and silver forks are marked with his crest;  and he omits no opportunity to inform his friends, that the right of the  family to the arms was proved at Herald's College by his great uncle John.  He has receipts for mulligatawny and oyster soups, not to be equalled; and  another for currie-powder, which a friend of his obtained, as the greatest  of favours, from Sir Stamford Raffles, and which, though bound in honour  not to make known, he means to leave to his son by will, under certain  injunctions. His cookery of a \"French rabbit,\" provided the claret be  first-rate, is superb; and on _very_ particular occasions, he condescends  to know how to concoct a bowl of punch, especially champagne punch, for  the which he has a formula in rhyme, the poetry of which never, as is its  happy case, losing sight of correctness and common-sense, comes, as well  as its subject matter, home to \"his business and his bosom.\" His \"caviar\"  is, through the kindness of a commercial friend, imported from the hand of  the very Russian _cuisinier_, who prepares it (unctuous relish!) for the  table of the Emperor himself. His cheese is Stilton or Parmesan.    Like \"Mrs. Diana Scapes,\" he is also \"curious in his liquors,\" and, in  despite of Beau Brummell, patronizes \"malt,\" as far as to take one glass  of excellent \"college ale,\"--which he gets through his friend Dr. Dusty of  All Souls--between pastry and Parmesan. After cheese, he can relish one,  and only one, glass of port--all the better if of the \"Comet vintage,\" or  of some vintage ten years anterior to that. His drink, however, is claret,  old hock, Madeira, and latterly, since it has become a sort of fashion,  old sherry. In these he is a connoisseur not to be sneezed at; and if  asked his opinion, makes it a rule never to give it upon the first glass,  invariably observing, that \"if he would he couldn't, and if he could he  _wouldn't_!\" He produces anchovy toast as an indispensable in a long  evening, after dinner, and to it he recommends a liqueur-glass of  cherry-brandy, which he believes is of that incomparable recipe, of which  the late King was so fond. If he be a bachelor, he has, in his dining-room,  a cellaret, in which repose this, and other similar liquid rarities, and  beneath his sideboard stands a machine, for which he paid twelve guineas,  for producing _ice extempore_.    His literary tastes bear a certain resemblance to, and have a certain  analogy with, his gustatory--proving the truth of that intimate connexion  between the stomach and the head, upon which physiologists are so  delighted to dwell. In poetry the heresies and escapades of Lord Byron are  too much for him, although as a Peer and a gentleman he always speaks well  and deferentially of him. Shelley he can make nothing of, and therefore  says, which is the strict truth in one sense at least, that he has never  read him. He praises Campbell, Crabbe, and Rogers, and shakes his head at  Tom Moore; but Pope is his especial favourite; and if anything in verse  has his heart, it is the \"Rape of the Lock.\" Peter Pindar he partly  dislikes, but Anstey, the \"Bath Guide,\" is high in his estimation; and  with him \"Gray's Odes\" stand far above those of Collins'. Of the \"Elegy in  a Country Church\" he thinks, as he says, \"like the rest of the world.\"  \"Shenstone's Pastorals\" he has read. Burns he praises, but in his heart  thinks him a \"wonderful clown,\" and shrugs his shoulders at his extreme  popularity. He says as little about Shakespeare as he can, and has by  heart some half dozen lines of Milton, which is all he really knows of him.  In the drama he inclines to the \"unities;\" and of the English Theatre  \"Sheridan's School for Scandal,\" and Otway's \"Venice Preserved,\" or Rowe's  \"Fair Penitent,\" are what he best likes in his heart. John Kemble is his  favourite actor--Kean he thinks somewhat vulgar. In prose he thinks Dr.  Johnson the greatest man that ever existed, and next to him he places  Addison and Burke. His historian is Hume; and for morals and metaphysics  he goes to Paley and Dr. Reid, or Dugald Stewart, and is well content. For  the satires of Swift he has no relish. They discompose his ideas; and he  of all things detests to have his head set a spinning like a tetotum,  either by a book or by anything else. Bishop Berkeley once did this for  him to such a tune, that he showed a visible uneasiness at the mention of  the book ever after. In Tristram Shandy, however, he has a sort of  suppressed delight, which he hardly likes to acknowledge, the magnet of  attraction being, though he knows it not, in the characters of Uncle Toby,  Corporal Trim, and the Widow Wadman. His religious reading is confined to  \"Blair's Sermons,\" and the \"Whole Duty of Man,\" in which he always keeps a  little slip of double gilt-edged paper as a marker, without reflecting  that it is a sort of proof that he has never got through either. His  Pocket Bible always lies upon his toilet table. He knows a little of  Mathematics in general, a little of Algebra, and a little of Fluxions,  which is principally to be discovered from his having Emmerson, Simpson,  and Bonnycastle's works in his library. In classical learning he confesses  to having \"forgotten\" a good deal of Greek; but sports a Latin phrase upon  occasion, and is something of a critic in languages. He prefers Virgil to  Homer, and Horace to Pindar, and can, upon occasion, enter into a  dissertation on the precise meaning of a \"Simplex munditiis.\" He also  delights in a pun, and most especially in a Latin one; and when applied to  for payment of _paving-rate_, never fails to reply \"_Paveant_ illi, non  _paveam_ ego!\" which, though peradventure repeated for the twentieth time,  still serves to sweeten the adieu between his purse and its contents. He  is also an amateur in etymologies and derivatives, and is sorry that the  learned Selden's solution of the origin of the term \"gentleman\" seems to  include in it something not altogether complimentary to religion. This is  his only objection to it. He speaks French; and his accent is, he flatters  himself, an approximation to the veritable Parisian. Modern novels he does  not read, but has read \"Waverley\" and \"Pelham.\"    His library is not large, but select; and as he does not sit in it  excepting very occasionally, the fire grate is a movable one, and can be  turned at will from parlour to library and _vice versa_,--a whim of his  old acquaintance Dr. Trifle of Oxford. In it are his library table and  stuffed chair; a bust of Pitt and another of Cicero; a patent inkstand and  silver pen; an atlas, and maps upon rollers; a crimson screen, an improved  \"Secretaire;\" a barometer and a thermometer. Upon the shelves may be found  almost for certain Boswell's Johnson; Encyclopaedia Britannica; Peptic  Precepts and Cook's Oracle; the Miseries of Human Life; Prideaux'  Connexion of the Old and New Testament; Dr. Pearson's Culina Famulatrix  Medecinae; Soame Jenyn's Essays; the Farrier's Guide; Selden's Table-talk;  Archbishop Tillotson's Sermons; Henderson on Wines; Boscawen's Horace;  Croker's Battles of Talavera and Busaco; Dictionary of Quotations; Lord  Londonderry's Peninsular Campaigns; the Art of Shaving, with directions  for the management of the Razor; Todd's Johnson's Dictionary; Peacham's  Complete Gentleman; Harris' Hermes; Roget on the Teeth; Memoirs of Pitt;  Jokeby, a Burlesque on Rokeby; English Proverbs; Paley's Moral Philosophy;  Chesterfield's Letters; Buchan's Domestic Medicine; Debrett's Peerage;  Colonel Thornton's Sporting Tour; Court Kalendar; the Oracle, or Three  Hundred Questions explained and answered; Gordon's Tacitus an Elzevir  Virgil; Epistolae obscurorum virorum; Martial's Epigrams; Tully's Offices;  and Henry's Family Bible.    His general character for nicety is excellent, both in a moral and  religious point of view: and he holds himself to have done a questionable  thing in looking into a number of Harriette Wilson, in which a gay  _quondam_ friend of his figured. When he marries, the ceremony is  performed by the Honourable and very Reverend the Dean of some place, to  whom he claims a distant relationship. He takes his wine in moderation;  never bets, nor plays above guinea points, and _always_ at whist. He goes  to church regularly; his pew is a square one, with green curtains. He  dines upon fish on Good Friday, and declines visiting during Passion week  in mixed parties. If he ever had any peccadilloes of any kind, they are  buried in a cloud as snug as that which shrouded the pious Eneas when he  paid his first visit to Queen Dido.    He dies, aged fifty-seven, of a pleuritic attack, complicated with angina  pectoris; and having left fifty pounds to each of the principal charitable  institutions of his neighbourhood, and fifty pounds to the churchwardens  of his parish, to be distributed amongst the poor professing the religion  of the Church of England, he is buried in his \"family vault,\" and his last  wish fulfilled,--that is to say, his epitaph is composed in Latin, and the  inscription put up under the especial care and inspection of his friend Dr.  Dusty of Oxford. _Requiescat._           *       *       *       *       *      THE VILLAGE CEMETERY.    In the _New Monthly Magazine_, just published is a powerful poem--the  _Splendid Village_, by the author of \"Corn-law Rhymes.\" from which we  extract the following passage:      I sought the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12552"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 19, No. 542, April (#3)"],[1,"time, and in the course of  conversation, one of them observed that they had in their possession a  tobe, which belonged to a white man who came from the north many years ago,  and from whom it had been purchased by the king's father. We expressed  great curiosity to see this tobe, and it was sent us as a present a short  time after their departure. Contrary to our expectations, we found it to  be made of rich crimson damask, and very heavy from the immense quantity  of gold embroidery with which it was covered. As the time when the late  king was said to have purchased this tobe corresponds very nearly to the  supposed period of Mr. Park's death, and as we never heard of any other  white man having come from the north so far south as Boossa, we are  inclined to believe it to be part of the spoil obtained from the canoe of  that ill-fated traveller. Whether Mr. Park wore the tobe himself, which is  scarcely probable on account of its weight, or whether he intended it as a  present to a native chief, we are at a loss to determine. At all events,  the article is a curiosity in itself; and if we should live to return to  England, we shall easily learn whether it was made there or not. The chief  himself has never worn the tobe, nor did his predecessor, from a  superstitious feeling; 'besides,' observed the king, 'it might excite the  cupidity of the neighbouring powers.'    \"_Sunday, June 20th_.--The king sent a messenger this morning, to inform  us that he was a tailor, and that he would thank us for some thread and a  few needles for his own private use. By this man he likewise sent a musket  for us to repair; but as it is Sunday, we have declined doing it till  to-morrow. Eager as we are to obtain even the slightest information  relative to the unhappy fate of Mr. Park and his companions, as well as to  ascertain if any of their books or papers are now in existence at this  place, we had almost made up our minds to refrain from asking any  questions on the subject, because we were apprehensive that it might be  displeasing to the king, and involve us in many perplexities. Familiarity,  however, having in some measure worn off this impression, and the king  being an affable, obliging, and good-natured person, we were emboldened to  send Paskoe to him this morning, with a message expressive of the interest  we felt on the subject, in common with all our countrymen; and saying that,  if any books or papers which belonged to Mr. Park were yet in his  possession, he would do us a great service, by delivering them into our  hands, or at least by granting us permission to see them. To this the king  returned for answer, that when Mr. Park was lost in the Niger, he was a  very little boy, and that he knew not what had become of his effects; that  the deplorable event had occurred in the reign of the late king's  predecessor, who died shortly after; and that all traces of the white man  had been lost with him. This answer disappointed our hopes, for to us it  appeared final and decisive. But in the evening they were again raised by  a hint from our host, who is the king's drummer, and one of the principal  men in the country: he assured us, that there was certainly one book at  least saved from Mr. Park's canoe, which is now in the possession of a  very poor man in the service of his master, to whom it had been entrusted  by the late king during his last illness. He said moreover, that if but  one application were made to the king, on any subject whatever, very  little was thought of it; but if a second were made, the matter would be  considered of sufficient importance to demand his whole attention,--such  being the custom of the country. The drummer therefore recommended us to  persevere in our inquiries, for he had no doubt that something to our  satisfaction would be elicited. At his own request, we sent him to the  king immediately, desiring him to repeat our former statement, and to  assure the king, that should he be successful in recovering the book we  wanted, our monarch would reward him handsomely. He desired the drummer to  inform us, that he would use every exertion, and examine the man who was  reported to have the white man's book in his possession, at an early hour  to-morrow. Here the matter at present rests.           *       *       *       *       *    \"In the afternoon, the king came to see us, followed by a man with a book  under his arm, which was said to have been picked up in the Niger after  the loss of our countryman. It was enveloped in a large cotton cloth, and  our hearts beat high with expectation as the man was slowly unfolding it,  for by its size we guessed it to be Mr. Park's journal; but our  disappointment and chagrin were great, when, on opening the book, we  discovered it to be an old nautical publication of the last century. The  title-page was missing, but its contents were chiefly tables of logarithms.  It was a thick royal quarto, which led us to conjecture that it was a  journal; between the leaves we found a few loose papers of very little  consequence indeed; one of them contained two or three observations on the  height of the water in the Gambia; one was a tailor's bill on a Mr.  Anderson; and another was addressed to Mr. Mungo Park, and contained an  invitation to dinner,--the following is a copy of it:--      'Mr. and Mrs. Watson would be happy to    have the pleasure of Mr. Park's company at    dinner on Tuesday next, at half-past five    o'clock.      'An answer is requested.      '_Strand, 9th Nov. 1804_.'    \"The king, as well as the owner of the book, looked as greatly mortified  as ourselves, when they were told that the one produced was not that of  which we were in quest, because the reward promised would not of course be  obtained. As soon as our curiosity had been fully satisfied, the papers  were carefully collected and placed again between the leaves, and the book  as carefully folded in its envelope as before, and taken away by its owner,  who values it as much as a household god. Thus all our hopes of obtaining  Mr. Park's journal or papers, in this city, are entirely defeated. The  inquiry, on our part, has not been prosecuted without much trouble and  anxiety, and some little personal sacrifices likewise, which, had they  been ten times as great, we would gladly have made whilst a single hope  remained of their being effectual.\"    After much ado at Boossa, owing to the canoe not being ready--the \"King of  the Canoe,\" a sort of Lord of the Admiralty, informing the travellers with  the utmost unconcern that it was out of repair--they     _Embark on the Niger_.    \"About mid-day the workmen having finished our canoe, the luggage was  presently put into it, and between twelve and one we embarked with our  people, and were launched out into the river. The direction of this branch  was nearly east and west; and we proceeded some distance down the stream  for the purpose of getting into the main branch of the Niger, where there  is deeper water. This object was soon attained, and we found it flowing  from north to south, through a rich and charming country, which seemed to  improve in appearance the further we advanced. We were propelled at a good  rate up a channel, which, from half a mile in breadth, gradually widened  to rather better than a mile. Beautiful, spreading, and spiry trees  adorned the country on each side of the river, like a park; corn, nearly  ripe, waved over the water's edge; large, open villages appeared every  half-hour; and herds of spotted cattle were observed grazing and enjoying  the cool of the shade. The appearance of the river, for several miles, was  no less enchanting than its borders; it was as smooth as a lake; canoes  laden with sheep and goats, were paddled by women down its almost  imperceptible current; swallows, and a variety of aquatic birds, were  sporting over its glassy surface, which was ornamented by a number of  pretty little islands.    \"_Friday, June 25th_.--The most remarkable object which we saw on rising  this morning, was a rugged and romantic range of hills, appearing to the  eastward of our encampment; it is called _Engarskie_, from a country of  the same name in which the hills are situated, and which was formerly an  independent kingdom, but is now become a province of Yaoorie. At a little  before seven, A.M., our canoe was pushed off the sandy beach on which it  had been secured last evening, and propelled down a very narrow channel,  between a large sand-bank and the shore. This conducted us into the main  branch of the Niger, and we again admired its delightful and magnificent  appearance.    \"We had proceeded only a few hundred yards when the river gradually  widened to two miles, and continued so as far as the eye could reach. It  looked very much like an artificial canal; the banks having the appearance  of a dwarf wall, with vegetation beyond. In most places the water was  extremely shallow, but in others it was deep enough to float a frigate.  During the first two hours of the day, the scenery was as interesting and  picturesque as can be imagined. The banks were literally covered with  hamlets and villages; fine trees, bending under the weight of their dark  and impenetrable foliage, everywhere relieved the eye from the glare of  the sun's rays, and, contrasted with the lively verdure of the little  hills and plains, produced the most pleasing effect. Afterwards, however,  there was a decided change; the banks, which before consisted of dark  earth, clay, or sand, were now composed of black rugged rocks; large  sand-banks and islands were scattered in the river, which diverted it into  a variety of little channels, and effectually destroyed its appearance.    \"We had heard so unfavourable an account of the state of the river at one  particular place which we should have to pass, that our people were  compelled to disembark and walk along the banks a considerable way till we  had passed it,"]]]
