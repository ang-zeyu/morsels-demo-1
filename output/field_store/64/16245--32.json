Brig _Laurel_, River St. Laurence.  August 6, 1832.    I LEFT off writing, my dear mother, from this simple cause;--I had  nothing to say. One day was but the echo, as it were, of the one that  preceded it; so that a page copied from the mate's log would have proved  as amusing, and to the full as instructive, as my journal provided I had  kept one during the last fortnight.    So barren of events has that time been that the sight of a party of  bottle-nosed whales, two or three seals, and a porpoise, possibly on  their way to a dinner or tea party at the North Pole, was considered an  occurrence of great importance. Every glass was in requisition as soon  as they made their appearance, and the marine monsters were well nigh  stared out of countenance.    We came within sight of the shores of Newfoundland on the 5th of August,  just one month from the day we took our last look of the British isles.  Yet though the coast was brown, and rugged, and desolate, I hailed its  appearance with rapture. Never did any thing seem so refreshing and  delicious to me as the land breeze that came to us, as I thought,  bearing health and gladness on its wings.    I had noticed with some curiosity the restless activity of the captain's  bird some hours previous to \"land\" being proclaimed from the look-out  station. He sang continually, and his note was longer, clearer, and more  thrilling than heretofore; the little creature, the captain assured me,  was conscious of the difference in the air as we approached the land. \"I  trust almost as much to my bird as to my glass,\" he said, \"and have  never yet been deceived.\"    Our progress was somewhat tedious after we entered the gulf. Ninety  miles across is the entrance of this majestic river; it seems an ocean  in itself. Half our time is spent poring over the great chart in the  cabin, which is constantly being rolled and unrolled by my husband to  gratify my desire of learning the names of the distant shores and  islands which we pass.    We are without a pilot as yet, and the captain being a cautious seaman  is unwilling to risk the vessel on this dangerous navigation; so that we  proceed but slowly on our voyage.    August 7.--We were visited this morning by a beautiful little bird, not  much larger than our gold-crested wren. I hailed it as a bird of good  omen--a little messenger sent to bid us welcome to the New World, and I  felt almost a childish joy at the sight of our little visitor. There are  happy moments in our lives when we draw the greatest pleasure from the  most trifling sources, as children are pleased with the most simple toy.    From the hour we entered the gulf a perceptible change had taken place  in all on board. The captain, a man of grave, quiet manners, grew quite  talkative. My husband was more than usually animated, and even the  thoughtful young Scotchman became positively an entertaining person. The  crew displayed the most lively zeal in the performance of their duty,  and the goldfinch sung cheerily from dawn till sunset. As for me Hope  was busy in my heart, chasing from it all feelings of doubt or regret  that might sadden the present or cloud the future.    I am now able to trace distinctly the outline of the coast on the  southern side of the river. Sometimes the high lands are suddenly  enveloped in dense clouds of mist, which are in constant motion, rolling  along in shadowy billows, now tinted with rosy light, now white and  fleecy, or bright as silver, as they catch the sunbeams. So rapid are  the changes that take place in the fog-bank, that perhaps the next time  I raise my eyes I behold the scene changed as if by magic. The misty  curtain is slowly drawn up, as if by invisible hands, and the wild,  wooded mountains partially revealed, with their bold rocky shores and  sweeping bays. At other times the vapoury volume dividing, moves along  the valleys and deep ravines, like lofty pillars of smoke, or hangs in  snowy draperies among the dark forest pines.    I am never weary of watching these fantastic clouds; they recall to me  the pleasant time I spent in the Highlands, among the cloud-capped hills  of the north.    As yet, the air is cold, and we experience frequent squalls of wind and  hail, with occasional peals of thunder; then again all is serene and  bright, and the air is filled with fragrance, and flies, and bees, and  birds come flitting past us from the shore.      August 8.--Though I cannot but dwell with feelings of wonder and  admiration on the majesty and power of this mighty river, I begin to  grow weary of its immensity, and long for a nearer view of the shore;  but at present we see nothing more than long lines of pine-clad hills,  with here and there a white speck, which they tell me are settlements  and villages to the south; while huge mountains divested of verdure  bound our view on the north side the river. My admiration of mountainous  scenery makes me dwell with more interest on this side the river, and I  watch the progress of cultivation along these rugged and inhospitable  regions with positive pleasure.    During the last two days we have been anxiously looking out for a pilot  to take us up to Quebec. Various signals have been fired, but hitherto  without success; no pilot has condescended to visit us, so we are  somewhat in the condition of a stage without a coachman, with only some  inexperienced hand to hold the reins. I already perceive some  manifestations of impatience appearing among us, but no one blames the  captain, who is very anxious about the matter; as the river is full of  rocks and shoals, and presents many difficulties to a person not  intimately acquainted with the navigation. Besides, he is answerable for  the safety of the ship to the underwriters, in case he neglects to take  a pilot on board.    * * * * * * *    While writing above I was roused by a bustle on deck, and going up to  learn the cause was informed that a boat with the long looked-for pilot  had put off from the shore; but, after all the fuss and bustle, it  proved only a French fisherman, with a poor ragged lad, his assistant.  The captain with very little difficulty persuaded Monsieur Paul Breton  to pilot us as far as Green Island, a distance of some hundred miles  higher up the river, where he assured us we should meet with a regular  pilot, if not before.    I have some little difficulty in understanding Monsieur Paul, as he  speaks a peculiar dialect; but he seems good-natured and obliging  enough. He tells us the corn is yet green, hardly in ear, and the summer  fruits not yet ripe, but he says, that at Quebec we shall find apples  and fruit in plenty.    As we advance higher up the river the country on both sides begins to  assume a more genial aspect. Patches of verdure, with white cottages,  are seen on the shores and scattered along the sides of the mountains;  while here and there a village church rears its simple spire,  distinguished above the surroundings buildings by its glittering vane  and bright roof of tin. The southern shores are more populous but less  picturesque than those of the north, but there is enough on either side  to delight the eye.    This morning we anchored off the Isle of Bic, a pretty low island,  covered with trees and looking very pleasant. I felt a longing desire to  set my foot on Canadian ground, and must own I was a little disappointed  when the captain advised me to remain on board, and not attempt to make  one of the party that were preparing to go on shore: my husband seconded  the captain's wish, so I contented myself with leaning over the ship's  side and feasting my eyes on the rich masses of foliage as they waved to  and fro with the slight breeze that agitated them. I had soon reason to  be thankful that I had not followed my own wayward will, for the  afternoon proved foggy, and on the return of the boat I learned that the  ground was swampy just where the party landed, and they sunk over their  ankles in water. They reported the island to be covered knee-deep with a  most luxuriant growth of red clover, tall trees, low shrubs, and an  abundance of wild flowers.    That I might not regret not accompanying him, my husband brought me a  delightful bouquet, which he had selected for me. Among the flowers were  fragrant red roses, resembling those we call Scotch burnet-leaved, with  smooth shining leaves and few if any thorns; the blue flower called  Pulmonaria or Lungwort, which I gathered in the Highlands, a sweet pea,  with red blossoms and wreaths of lovely pale green foliage; a white  orchis, the smell of which was quite delicious. Besides these were  several small white and yellow flowers, with which I was totally  unacquainted. The steward furnished me with a china jar and fresh water,  so that I shall have the pleasure of a nosegay during the rest of the  voyage. The sailors had not forgotten a green bough or two to adorn the  ship, and the bird-cage was soon as bowery as leaves could make it.    Though the weather is now very fine, we make but slow progress; the  provoking wind seems determined to blow from every quarter but the  right. We float up with the flood tide, and when the tide fails cast  anchor, and wait with the best grace we can till it is time to weigh  anchor again. I amuse myself with examining the villages and settlements  through the captain's glass, or watching for the appearance of the white  porpoises tumbling among the waves. These creatures are of a milky  whiteness, and have nothing of the disgusting look of the black ones.  Sometimes a seal pops its droll head up close beside our vessel, looking  very much like Sinbad's little old man of the sea.    It is fortunate for me that my love of natural history enables me to  draw amusement from objects that are deemed by many unworthy of  attention. To me they present an inexhaustible fund of interest. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13568"],[0,"Woman Suffrage By Federal Constitutional Amendment (#3)"],[1,", means to defer woman suffrage  until the most ignorant, most narrow-minded, most un-American, are  ready for it. The removal of the question to the higher court of the  Congress and the Legislatures of the several states means that it will  be established when the intelligent, Americanized, progressive people  of the country are ready for it.          CHAPTER II.    STATE CONSTITUTIONAL OBSTRUCTIONS[A]    [Footnote A: Table of difficulties in each state is to be found in the  Appendix.]    MARY SUMNER BOYD      At its last session the Arkansas Legislature passed a Woman Suffrage  bill by a generous majority; in Kentucky a bill passed both houses  and one house in five other states. One of these was Arkansas where a  constitutional provision that only three amendments can be submitted  to the people at once rendered of no avail the passage of the  Legislature. In the five other states the enormous Constitutional  majorities required in a legislative vote on amendments defeated the  measure.    This is the story of a typical year and these are two of the  difficulties which beset the gaining of suffrage \"state by state.\"  Year after year labor is thrown away and money wasted because actual  minorities in legislatures can defeat constitutional amendments; or  because once past the legislature, constitutional technicalities can  keep them away from the polls; or because, safely past these hazards,  a minority vote of the people can defeat a bill that has successfully  reached the polls.    Theoretically an amendment to a state constitution must have the  approval of the Legislature, ratified by the approval of the people.  This ratification is what differentiates it from a statutory law. This  is the actual requirement, however, in but two of the male suffrage  states, South Dakota and Missouri. In all the rest, except Delaware  and New Hampshire, which have special methods of amending, much more  than simple passage and ratification is required.    There are some half-dozen classes of technical requirements which make  the amending of many state constitutions wellnigh impossible. Some  states have never been able to amend; others have had to submit the  same amendment again and again before it passed, even in the case of  measures which were not unpopular. The Legislatures of Nebraska and  Alabama have occasionally succeeded in passing amendments favored  by politicians, by resorting to clever tricks to circumvent the  constitutional handicaps. Only by outwitting the framers have they  been able to make changes in their constitutions.    Among the common technical requirements are the passing by a set  proportion much larger than a mere majority of the legislature;  the passing of the people's vote by a majority of those voting for  candidates and not merely of those voting on the amendment itself;  the setting of special time and other limits for the submission  of amendments, etc. Many states combine three or more of these  requirements.    No impediment seems more vexatious than that which prevented the  Arkansas bill from coming before the people after the Legislature of  1915 had approved submission. Nor is Arkansas alone in limiting  the number of amendments to be submitted to the people at one time;  Kentucky goes farther and makes the limit two and Illinois allows but  one at a time.    The other six states whose bill failed at the last session belong to a  group of fifteen which require a special \"constitutional majority\" of  two-thirds or three-fifths favorable in the vote of both houses on an  amendment bill.[A] In South Carolina and Mississippi it must pass  two legislatures by this large vote, one before and one after the  referendum; in Mississippi this means four years' delay for its  sessions are quadrennial. In thirteen states the amendment bill must  pass two legislatures, in some by a constitutional majority at one  passage.[B]    Alabama is one of the states whose bill failed through the  constitutional majority rule in 1915. In that state another suffrage  bill must wait four years for the next legislative session. If this  time it surmounts the hazard of a three-fifths favorable vote it will  be faced by another hazard; for Alabama is one of nine states in which  an amendment must pass the    [Footnote A: South Carolina, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, West  Virginia, Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi--all a two-thirds vote,  and Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Maryland and Kentucky a  three-fifths vote.]    [Footnote B: In Connecticut, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont by a  two-thirds majority of one Legislature or of one house or both; in  Iowa, Indiana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin, New  Jersey, New York and Rhode Island by majorities. All but the last  three have biennial Legislatures.] referendum not by a majority on  the amendment but by a majority of all voting for candidates at this  general election.[A]    [Footnote A: These states are Arkansas, Illinois, Minnesota,  Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Tennessee. Rhode  Island sets a definite majority (three-fifths) of those voting at the  election. Probably Texas and North Carolina should be included but the  amendment clause in their constitutions is misleading and they may  be given the benefit of the doubt; their clause reads: \"An amendment  shall be submitted to the voters and adopted by a majority of the  votes cast.\"]    This requirement by itself is regarded by one authority on state  constitutions[B] as making amendment practically impossible for it  means that the indifference and inertia of the mass of the voters can  be a more serious enemy than active opposition; the man who does not  take the trouble to vote is as much to be feared as the man who votes  against.    [Footnote B: Dodd, W.F. Revision and Amendment of State  Constitutions.]    A majority vote is required by the constitution of Indiana that is so  extravagant as to have caused contradictory decisions in the courts.  The constitution reads: \"The General Assembly ... (shall) submit such  amendment ... to the electors of the state, and if a majority of said  electors shall ratify.\" This was interpreted in one case (156 Ind.  104) to mean a majority of all votes cast at the election, but in a  later case (in re Denny) it was taken, exactly as it reads, to mean  all the people in the State eligible to vote--and this in the face of  the fact that the number of people eligible to vote is unknown even  to the Federal Census Department. Indiana also requires that while one  amendment is under consideration no other can be introduced. She is,  needless to say, one of the states whose constitution has never been  amended.    Other states besides Indiana have time requirements to insure the  immutability of their inspired state document. Thus the Vermont  Constitution can be amended only once in ten years--it was last  amended in 1913--and five others set a term of years before the same  amendment can be submitted again. Among these are New Jersey and  Pennsylvania, which having submitted the Woman Suffrage amendment in  1915 cannot do so again till 1920.[A]    [Footnote A: The five states are Illinois (four years), Pennsylvania,  New Jersey and Kentucky (five years), and Tennessee (six years).]    In no state is the Constitution so safeguarded from change as in New  Mexico, whose iron-bound rules are in a class by themselves. For the  first twenty-five years of statehood a three-fourths vote of both  houses of the Legislature ratified by three-fourths of the electors  voting, with two-thirds at least from each county, will be required to  change the suffrage clause. After twenty-five years the majority  will be reduced to two-thirds. This is the state whose Constitution  provides that illiteracy shall never be a bar to the suffrage; her  democracy falls short only in the matter of women whom she makes it  constitutionally impossible ever to add to her electorate.    Where constitutions can be revised by the convention method as well as  by amendment there is some hope; if amendment fails revision holds out  a chance. But twelve states[A] hold no constitutional conventions; in  Maryland conventions are twenty years apart and in many other states  it is as difficult to call a constitutional convention as to revise  the Constitution by amendment.    [Footnote A: Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, North Dakota, Arkansas,  Connecticut, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode  Island and Virginia.]    New Hampshire amends by constitutional convention alone and these  conventions are held infrequently.    Only in Delaware is the Constitution amended to-day by act of the  Legislature without the people's vote and without any technical  requirements except a large Legislative majority.    Yet in twenty-four states[A] before the Civil War the foundations of  male suffrage were laid by legislature or constitutional convention  alone, and in many cases, furthermore, the conditions of suffrage were  dictated by the Federal Government. Even as late as the '90's five  State Constitutions were adopted, suffrage clause and all, by State  Legislatures or constitutional conventions without the referendum.[B]    [Footnote A: New Hampshire, South Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania,  North Carolina, Georgia, New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New  Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Vermont, Kentucky, Florida, Tennessee,  Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana, Mississippi, Illinois, Alabama, Missouri and  Arkansas.]    [Footnote B: Many reconstruction constitutions also but these were not  permanent. The five constitutions in the 90's were Mississippi, South  Carolina, Delaware, Louisiana and Virginia, and Kentucky made changes  after the constitution had been submitted.]    In the other states universal male suffrage came easily at a time  when thinly populated states wanted to hold out inducements to male  immigrant labor.
