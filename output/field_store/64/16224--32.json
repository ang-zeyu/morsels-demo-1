TOWARDS HERVEY'S BAY.]    THURSDAY 22 JULY 1802    Lieutenant John Murray, commander of the brig Lady Nelson, having  received orders to put himself under my command, I gave him a small code  of signals, and directed him, in case of separation, to repair to  Hervey's Bay; which he was to enter by a passage said to have been found  by the south-sea whalers, between Sandy Cape and Break-sea Spit. In the  morning of July 22, we sailed out of Port Jackson together; and the  breeze being fair and fresh, ran rapidly to the northward, keeping at a  little distance from the coast. (Atlas, Plate VIII.)    At eleven o'clock, the south head of Broken Bay bore W. by N. three  leagues; and Mr. Westall then made a sketch of the entrance, with that of  the Hawkesbury River, which falls into it (Atlas, Plate XVIII, View 2).  The colonists have called this place Broken Bay, but it is not what was  so named by captain Cook; for he says it lies in latitude 33 deg. 42'  (Hawkesworth III. 103), whereas the southernmost point of entrance is not  further than 33 deg. 34' south. There is, in captain Cook's latitude, a very  small opening, and the hills behind it answer to his description of \"some  broken land that seemed to form a bay,\" when seen at four leagues, the  distance he was off; but in reality, there is nothing more than a shallow  lagoon in that place. In consequence of this difference in position, Cape  Three-points has been sought three or four leagues to the north of Broken  Bay; whereas it is the north head of the entrance into the bay itself  which was so named, and it corresponds both in situation and appearance.    At noon, the south-eastern bluff of Cape Three-points bore S. 64 deg. W.,  seven or eight miles, and was found to lie in 33 deg. 321/2' south and 151 deg.  231/2' east. In steering northward along the coast, at from six to two  miles distance, we passed two rocky islets lying under the high shore;  and at sunset, Coal Island, in the entrance of Port Hunter, bore N. 9 deg.  W., five or six miles. This port was discovered in 1797 by the late  captain John Shortland, and lies in 32 deg. 56' south, longitude 151 deg. 43'  east.    We passed Port Stephens a little before midnight; and the breeze being  fresh at W. by S., the Lady Nelson was left astern, and we lay to for an  hour next morning [FRIDAY 23 JULY 1802], to wait her coming up. The land  was then scarcely visible, but a north course brought us in with the  Three Brothers (Atlas Plate IX.); and at four in the afternoon, they bore  from S. 56 deg. to 65 deg. W., the nearest land being a low, but steep point,  distant four or five miles in the first direction. The Three Brothers lie  from one to five miles behind the shore, at the eastern extremity of a  range of high land, coming out of the interior country. The northernmost  hill is the broadest, most elevated, and nearest to the water side; and  being visible fifty miles from a ship's deck, is an excellent landmark  for vessels passing along the coast: its latitude is 31 deg. 43' south, and  longitude 152 deg. 45' east.    To the northward of the Three Brothers there is four leagues of low. and  mostly sandy shore; and after passing it, we came up with a projection,  whose top is composed of small, irregular-shaped hummocks, the  northernmost of them being a rocky lump of a sugar-loaf form; further on,  the land falls back into a shallow bight, with rocks in it standing above  water. When abreast of the projection, which was called _Tacking Point_,  the night was closing in, and we stood off shore, intending to make the  same part next morning; for some of this coast had been passed in the  dark by captain Cook, and might therefore contain openings.    SATURDAY 24 JULY 1802    At daybreak of the 24th, Tacking Point was distant three miles, and the  breeze fresh at S. W. by W. with fine weather. Our little consort being  out of sight, we stood an hour to the southward; and not seeing her in  that direction, bore away along the coast until noon, when our situation  was as under:      Latitude observed                           30 deg. 581/4'  Longitude by time-keepers                  153   61/2  Northern Brother, dist. 48 miles, bore   S. 23 W.  Smoky Cape, distant 3 or 4 miles, N. 41 deg. to 30 W.  Northern extreme of the land,             N. 5 W.      The coast from Tacking Point to Smoky Cape is generally low and sandy;  but its uniformity is broken at intervals by rocky points, which first  appear like islands. Behind them the land is low, but quickly rises to  hills of a moderate height; and these being well covered with wood, the  country had a pleasant appearance. Smoky Cape was found to answer the  description given of it by captain Cook; its centre lies in 30 deg. 55'  south, and 153 deg. 4' east. The three hummocks upon it stand on so many  projecting parts; and at half a mile from the southernmost lie two rocks,  and a third two miles further south, which were not before noticed. On  the north side of Smoky Cape, the coast falls back four or five miles to  the westward, forming a bight in the low land, where there may probably  be a shallow inlet; it afterwards resumed a northern direction, and  consisted as before of sandy beaches and stony points.    Our consort was not yet in sight; but we kept on until five in the  evening, when the nearest land was two miles off, and the northern  hummock on Smoky Cape bore S. 4 deg. W. nine leagues. I had before seen the  coast further northward, as far as 29 deg. 20'; and having therefore no  inducement to lose a night's run for its examination, we steered onward,  passing without side of the Solitary Isles. At three in the morning  [SUNDAY 25 JULY 1802], hove to until day-light; and at eight o'clock made  the south head of a bay discovered in the Norfolk (Introd. Vol I, \"In  latitude 29 deg. 43', we discovered a small opening like a river, with an  islet lying in the entrance; and at sunset, entered a larger, to which I  gave the name of SHOAL BAY, an appellation which it but too well  merited.\"), and named _Shoal Bay_. One of the marks for finding this  small place is a peaked hummock on the low land, thirteen miles distant;  and it was now set over the south head of the bay at S. 20 deg. W. In  steering northward close along the coast, we passed two small reefs, and  the water shoaled to 10 fathoms; they lie two miles off the land, and  there did not seem to be any safe passage within them. Our latitude at  noon was 29 deg. 4', and longitude by time keepers 153 deg.  31'; the shore was  three miles off but until we came up with Cape Byron at five in the  evening, there was no projection worthy of being particularly noticed.  From Shoal Bay to Cape Byron is fifty miles, where the coast, with the  exception of two or three rocky heads, is mostly low and sandy; and the  soundings, at from two to four miles off, vary between 10 and 32 fathoms,  on a sandy bottom. A few miles back the land rises to hills of moderate  elevation, which were poorly covered with wood in the southern part, but  towards the cape had a more fertile appearance.    Cape Byron is a small steep head, projecting about two miles from the low  land, and in coming along the coast makes like an island; its latitude is  28 deg. 38', and longitude 153 deg. 37', or 7' east of the situation assigned to  it by captain Cook. There are three rocks on its north side; and in the  direction of N. 57 deg. W., eight or nine leagues from it, is the peaked top  of a mass of mountains, named by its discoverer _Mount Warning_; whose  elevation is about 3300 feet, and exceeds that of Mount Dromedary, or any  other land I have seen upon this East Coast. To Mr. Westall's sketch of  this remarkable peak (Atlas, Plate XVIII.
