AINGER, ALFRED (1837-1904).--Biographer and critic, _s._ of an architect  in London, _grad._ at Cambridge, entered the Church, and, after holding  various minor preferments, became Master of the Temple. He wrote memoirs  of Hood and Crabbe, but is best known for his biography of Lamb and his  edition of his works in 6 vols. (1883-88).      AINSWORTH, WILLIAM HARRISON (1805-1882).--Novelist, _s._ of a solicitor,  was _b._ in Manchester. He was destined for the legal profession, which,  however, had no attraction for him; and going to London to complete his  studies made the acquaintance of Mr. John Ebers, publisher, and at that  time manager of the Opera House, by whom he was introduced to literary  and dramatic circles, and whose _dau._ he afterwards married. For a short  time he tried the publishing business, but soon gave it up and devoted  himself to journalism and literature. His first successful novel was  _Rookwood_, _pub._ in 1834, of which Dick Turpin is the leading  character, and thenceforward he continued to pour forth till 1881 a  stream of novels, to the number of 39, of which the best known are _The  Tower of London_ (1840), _Old St. Paul's_ (1841), _Lancashire Witches_,  and _The Constable of the Tower_. The titles of some of his other novels  are _Crichton_ (1837), _Jack Sheppard_ (1839), _Guy Fawkes_, _The Star  Chamber_, _The Flitch of Bacon_, _The Miser's Daughter_ (1842), and  _Windsor Castle_ (1843). A. depends for his effects on striking  situations and powerful descriptions: he has little humour or power of  delineating character.      AIRD, THOMAS (1802-1876).--Poet, _b._ at Bowden, Roxburghshire, went to  Edinburgh, where he became the friend of Professor Wilson, Carlyle, and  other men of letters. He contributed to _Blackwood's Magazine_, and was  editor of the _Dumfries Herald_ (1835-63). His chief poem is _The Captive  of Fez_ (1830); and in prose he wrote _Religious Characteristics_, and  _The Old Bachelor in the Old Scottish Village_ (1848), all of which were  received with favour. Carlyle said that in his poetry he found everywhere  \"a healthy breath as of mountain breezes.\"      AKENSIDE, MARK (1721-1770).--Poet, _s._ of a butcher at  Newcastle-upon-Tyne, gave early indications of talent, and was sent to  the University of Edinburgh with the view of becoming a dissenting  minister. While there, however, he changed his mind and studied for the  medical profession. Thereafter he went to Leyden, where he took his  degree of M.D. in 1744. While there he wrote his principal poem, _The  Pleasures of the Imagination_, which was well received, and was  subsequently translated into more than one foreign language. After trying  Northampton, he settled as a physician in London; but was for long  largely dependent for his livelihood on a Mr. Dyson. His talents brought  him a good deal of consideration in society, but the solemn and pompous  manner which he affected laid him open to some ridicule, and he is said  to have been satirised by Smollett (_q.v._) in his _Peregrine Pickle_. He  endeavoured to reconstruct his poem, but the result was a failure. His  collected poems were _pub._ 1772. His works, however, are now little  read. Mr. Gosse has described him as \"a sort of frozen Keats.\"      ALCOTT, LOUISA M. (1832-1888).--Writer of juvenile and other tales,  _dau._ of Amos Bronson Alcott, an educational and social theorist,  lecturer, and author, was _b._ in Pennsylvania. During the American civil  war she served as a nurse, and afterwards attained celebrity as a writer  of books for young people, of which the best is _Little Women_ (1868).  Others are _Little Men_ and _Jo's Boys_. She also wrote novels, including  _Moods_ and _Work_.      ALCUIN or EALHWINE (735-804).--Theologian and general writer, was _b._  and _ed._ at York. He wrote in prose and verse, his subjects embracing  educational, theological, and historical matters. Returning from Rome, to  which he had been sent to procure the _pallium_ for a friend, he met  Charlemagne at Parma, and made upon him so favourable an impression that  he was asked to enter his service as preceptor in the sciences to himself  and his family. His numerous treatises, which include metrical annals,  hagiographical and philosophical works, are not distinguished by  originality or profundity, but he is the best representative of the  culture and mental activity of his age, upon which, as the minister of  education of the great emperor, he had a widely-spread influence.      ALDRICH, THOMAS BAILEY (1836-1906).--Poet and novelist, _b._ at  Portsmouth, N.H., was for some time in a bank, and then engaged in  journalism. His first book was _The Bells, a Collection of Chimes_  (1855), and other poetical works are _The Ballad of Babie Bell_, _Cloth  of Gold_, _Flower and Thorn_, etc. In prose he wrote _Daisy's Necklace_,  _The Course of True Love_, _Marjorie Daw_, _Prudence Palfrey_, etc.      ALESIUS, ALEXANDER (1500-1565).--Theologian and controversialist. His  unlatinised name was Aless or Alane, and he was _b._ at Edinburgh and  _ed._ at St. Andrews, where he became a canon. Originally a strong and  able defender of the Romish doctrines, he was chosen to argue with  Patrick Hamilton, the proto-martyr of the Reformation in Scotland, with  the object of inducing him to recant. The result, however, was that he  was himself much shaken in his allegiance to the Church, and the change  was greatly accelerated by the martyrdom of H. His subsequent protest  against the immorality of the clergy led to his imprisonment, and  ultimately, in 1532, to his flying for his life to Germany, where he  became associated with Luther and Melancthon, and definitely joined the  reforming party. Coming to England in 1535, he was well received by  Cranmer and other reformers. While in England he studied medicine, and  practised as a physician in London. On the fall of T. Cromwell in 1540 he  again retired to Germany, where, at Leipzig, he obtained a professorship.  During the reign of Edward VI. he re-visited England and was employed by  Cranmer in connection with the 1st Liturgy of Edward VI. Returning to  Leipsic he passed the remainder of his days in peace and honour, and was  twice elected Rector of the University. His writings were both exegetical  and controversial, but chiefly the latter. They include _Expositio Libri  Psalmorum Davidis_ (1550). His controversial works refer to such subjects  as the translation of the Bible into the vernacular, against Servetus,  etc.      ALEXANDER, MRS. CECIL F. (HUMPHREYS) (1818-1895).--_dau._ of Maj. H.,  _b._ in Co. Waterford, _m._ the Rev. W. Alexander, afterwards Bishop of  Derry and Archbishop of Armagh. Her _Hymns for Little Children_ had  reached its 69th edition before the close of the century. Some of her  hymns, _e.g._ \"There is a Green Hill\" and \"The Roseate Hues of Early  Dawn,\" are known wherever English is spoken. Her husband has also written  several books of poetry, of which the most important is _St. Augustine's  Holiday and other Poems_.      ALFORD, HENRY (1810-1871).--Theologian, scholar, poet, and miscellaneous  writer, _s._ of a clergyman, was _b._ in London. After passing through  various private schools, he proceeded to Cambridge, where he had a  distinguished career, and after entering the Church and filling various  preferments in the country, became minister of Quebec Chapel, London,  whence he was promoted to be Dean of Canterbury. His great work was his  _Greek Testament_ in 4 vols., of which the first was _pub._ in 1849 and  the last in 1861. In this work he largely followed the German critics,  maintaining, however, a moderate liberal position; and it was for long  the standard work on the subject in this country. A. was one of the most  versatile men, and prolific authors, of his day, his works consisting of  nearly 50 vols., including poetry (_School of the Heart_ and _Abbot of  Munchelnaye_, and a translation of the _Odyssey_), criticism, sermons,  etc. In addition to the works above mentioned he wrote _Chapters on the  Greek Poets_ (1841), the _Queen's English_ (1863), and many well-known  hymns, and he was the first editor of the _Contemporary Review_. He was  also an accomplished artist and musician. His industry was incessant and  induced a premature breakdown in health, which terminated in his death in  1871. He was the friend of most of his eminent contemporaries, and was  much beloved for his amiable character.      ALISON, ARCHIBALD (1757-1839).--Didactic and philosophical writer, was  _b._ in Edinburgh and _ed._ at Glasgow University and Oxford. After being  presented to various livings in England, A. came to Edinburgh as  incumbent of St. Paul's Episcopal Chapel, where he attained popularity as  a preacher of sermons characterised by quiet beauty of thought and grace  of composition. His chief contribution to literature is his _Essay on the  Nature and Principles of Taste_ (1790), in which the \"association\" theory  is supported.      ALISON, SIR ARCHIBALD (1792-1867).--Historian, _s._ of the above, was  _b._ at Kenley, Shropshire, and after studying under a private tutor, and  at Edinburgh University, was, in 1814, called to the Bar, at which he  ultimately attained some distinction, becoming in 1834 Sheriff of  Lanarkshire, in which capacity he rendered valuable service in times of  considerable difficulty. It was when travelling in France in 1814 that he  conceived the idea of his _History of Europe_, which deals with the  period from the outbreak of the French Revolution to the restoration of  the Bourbons, and extends, in its original form (1833-42), to 10 vols.  The work is one of vast industry, and gives a useful account of an  important epoch, but is extremely diffuse and one-sided, and often prosy.  Disraeli satirises the author in _Coningsby_ as Mr. Wordy, who wrote a  history to prove that Providence"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13241"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#3)"],[1," retained  something of the old quaintness and melodiousness which procured them  the reputation of having been composed by Purcell and others. Nor  is this unlikely, when it is considered how fond those masters were  of sporting with their art, and setting the most trivial words to  music in their glees and catches. The primitive cries of cowslips,  primroses, and hot cross buns, seemed never to have quitted this  sequestered region. They were like daisies in a bit of surviving  field. There was an old seller of fish in particular, whose cry of  \"Shrimps as large as prawns,\" was such a regular, long-drawn, and  truly pleasing melody, that in spite of his hoarse, and I am afraid,  drunken voice, I used to wish for it of an evening, and hail it  when it came. It lasted for some years, then faded, and went out;  I suppose, with the poor old weather-beaten fellow's existence.  This sense of quiet and repose may have been increased by an early  association of Chelsea with something out of the pale; nay, remote.  It may seem strange to hear a man who has crossed the Alps talk of  one suburb as being remote from another. But the sense of distance is  not in space only; it is in difference and discontinuance. A little  back-room in a street in London is further removed from the noise,  than a front room in a country town. In childhood, the farthest local  point which I reached anywhere, provided it was quiet, always seemed  to me a sort of end of the world; and I remembered particularly  feeling this, the only time when I had previously visited Chelsea,  which was at that period of life.... I know not whether the corner I  speak of remains as quiet as it was. I am afraid not; for steamboats  have carried vicissitude into Chelsea, and Belgravia threatens it with  her mighty advent. But to complete my sense of repose and distance,  the house was of that old-fashioned sort which I have always loved  best, familiar to the eyes of my parents, and associated with  childhood. It had seats in the windows, a small third room on the  first floor, of which I made a _sanctum_, into which no perturbation  was to enter, except to calm itself with religious and cheerful  thoughts (a room thus appropriated in a house appears to me an  excellent thing;) and there were a few lime-trees in front, which in  their due season diffused a fragrance.    [Footnote 1: The Autobiography of Leigh Hunt. Two volumes. Harper &  Brothers. 1850.]           *       *       *       *       *    LAMARTINE'S NEW ROMANCE.    The great poet of affairs, philosophy, and sentiment, before leaving  the scenes of his triumphs and misfortunes for his present visit  to the East, confided to the proprietors of _Le Constitutionel_  a new chapter of his romanticized memoirs to be published in the  _feuilleton_ of that journal, under the name of \"Genevieve.\" This  work, which promises to surpass in attractive interest anything  Lamartine has given to the public in many years, will be translated as  rapidly as the advanced sheets of it are received here, by Mr. Fayette  Robinson, whose thorough apprehension and enjoyment of the nicest  delicacies of the French language, and free and manly style of  English, qualify him to do the fullest justice to such an author  and subject. His version of \"Genevieve\" will be issued, upon its  completion, by the publishers of _The International_. We give a  specimen of its quality in the following characteristic description,  of Marseilles, premising that the work is dedicated to \"Mlle.  Reine-Garde, seamstress, and formerly a servant, at Aix, in Provence.\"    \"Before I commence with the history of Genevieve, this series of  stories and dialogues used by country people, it is necessary to  define the spirit which animated their composition and to tell why  they were written. I must also tell why I dedicate this first story to  Mlle. Reine-Garde, seamstress and servant at Aix in Provence. This is  the reason.    \"I had passed a portion of the summer of 1846 at that Smyrna of  France, called Marseilles, that city, the commercial activity of which  has become the chief _ladder_ of national enterprise, and the general  rendezvous, of those steam caravans of the West, our railroads; a city  the Attic taste of which justifies it in assuming to itself all the  intellectual cultivation, like the Asiatic Smyrna, inherent in the  memory of great poets. I lived outside of the city, the heat of which  was too great for an invalid, in one of those villas formerly called  _bastides_, so contrived as to enable the occupants during the  calmness of a summer evening--and no people in the world love nature  so well--to watch the white sails and look on the motion of the  southern breeze. Never did any other people imbibe more of the spirit  of poetry than does that of Marseilles. So much does climate do for  it.    \"The garden of the little villa in which I dwelt opened by a gateway  to the sandy shore of the sea. Between it and the water was a long  avenue of plane trees, behind the mountain of Notre Dame de la Garde,  and almost touching the little lily-bordered stream which surrounded  the beautiful park and villa of the Borelli. We heard at our windows  every motion of the sea as it tossed on its couch and pillow of sand,  and when the garden gate was opened, the sea foam reached almost  the wall of the house, and seemed to withdraw so gradually as if to  deceive and laugh at any hand which would seek to bedew itself with  its moisture. I thus passed hour after hour seated on a huge stone  beneath a fig-tree, looking on that mingling of light and motion which  we call _the Sea_. From time to time the sail of a fisherman's boat,  or the smoke which hung like drapery above the pipe of a steamer,  rose above the chord of the arc which formed the gulf, and afforded a  relief to the monotony of the horizon.    \"On working days, this vista was almost a desert, but when Sunday  came, it was made lively by groups of sailors, rich and _idle_  citizens, and whole families of mercantile men who came to bathe or  rest themselves, there enjoying the luxury both of the shade and  of the sea. The mingled murmur of the voices both of men, women and  children, enchanted with sunlight and with repose, united with the  babbling of the waves which seemed to fall on the shore light and  elastic as sheets of steel. Many boats either by sails or oars, were  wafted around the extremity of Cape Notre-Dame de la Garde, with its  heavy grove of shadowy pines; as they crossed the gulf, they touched  the very margin of the water, to be able to reach the opposite bank.  Even the palpitations of the sail were audible, the cadence of  the oars, conversation, song, the laughter of the merry flower and  orange-girls of Marseilles, those true daughters of the gulf, so  passionately fond of the wave, and devoted to the luxury of wild  sports with their native element were heard.    \"With the exception of the patriarchal family of the Rostand, that  great house of ship-owners, which linked Smyrna, Athens, Syria and  Egypt to France by their various enterprises, and to whom I had been  indebted for all the pleasures of my first voyage to the East; with  the exception of M. Miege, the general agent of all our maritime  diplomacy in the Mediterranean, with the exception of Joseph Autran,  that oriental poet who refuses to quit his native region because  he prefers his natural elements to glory, I knew but few persons at  Marseilles. I wished to make no acquaintances and sought isolation  and leisure, leisure and study. I wrote the history of one revolution,  without a suspicion that the spirit of another convulsion looked over  my shoulder, hurrying me from the half finished page, to participate  not with the pen, but manually, in another of the great Dramas of  France.    \"Marseilles is however hospitable as its sea, its port, and its  climate. A beautiful nature there expands the heart. Where heaven  smiles man also is tempted to be mirthful. Scarcely had I fixed myself  in the faubourg, when the men of letters, of politics,--the merchants  who had proposed great objects to themselves, and who entertained  extended views; the youth, in the ears of whom yet dwelt the echoes  of my old poems; the men who lived by the labor of their own hands,  many of whom however write, study, sing, and make verses, come to my  retreat, bringing with them, however, that delicate reserve which is  the modesty and grace of hospitality. I received pleasure without any  annoyances from this hospitality and attention. I devoted my mornings  to study, my days to solitude and to the sea, my evenings to a small  number of unknown friends, who came from the city to speak to me of  travels, literature, and commerce.    \"Commerce at Marseilles is not a matter of paltry traffic, or trifling  parsimony and retrenchments of capital. Marseilles looks on all  questions of commerce as a dilation and expansion of French capital,  and of the raw material exported and imported from Europe and Asia.  Commerce at Marseilles is a lucrative diplomacy, at the same time,  both local and national. Patriotism animates its enterprises, honor  floats with its flag, and policy presides over every departure. Their  commerce is one eternal battle, waged on the ocean at their own peril  and risk, with those rivals who contend with France for Asia and  Africa, and for the purpose of extending the French name and fame over  the opposite continents which touch on the Mediterranean.    \"One Sunday, after a long excursion on the sea with Madame Lamartine,  we were told that a woman, modest and timid in her deportment, had  come in the diligence from Aix to Marseilles, and for four or five  hours had been waiting for us in a little orange grove next between  the villa and the garden. I suffered my wife to go into the house, and  passed myself into the orange grove to receive the stranger. I had  no acquaintance with any one at Aix, and was "]]]
