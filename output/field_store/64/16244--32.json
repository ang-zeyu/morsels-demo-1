It's to be right away--for Ludovic won't be put off a week longer than  necessary.\"    \"So Ludovic Speed has been hurried up to some purpose at last,\" said Mr.  Sherman, when Anne called in at Echo Lodge, brimful with her news. \"And  you are delighted, of course, and my poor pride must be the scapegoat. I  shall always be remembered in Grafton as the man from Boston who wanted  Theodora Dix and couldn't get her.\"    \"But that won't be true, you know,\" said Anne comfortingly.    Arnold Sherman thought of Theodora's ripe beauty, and the mellow  companionableness she had revealed in their brief intercourse.    \"I'm not perfectly sure of that,\" he said, with a half sigh.            II. Old Lady Lloyd      I. The May Chapter      Spencervale gossip always said that \"Old Lady Lloyd\" was rich and mean  and proud. Gossip, as usual, was one-third right and two-thirds wrong.  Old Lady Lloyd was neither rich nor mean; in reality she was pitifully  poor--so poor that \"Crooked Jack\" Spencer, who dug her garden and  chopped her wood for her, was opulent by contrast, for he, at least,  never lacked three meals a day, and the Old Lady could sometimes achieve  no more than one. But she WAS very proud--so proud that she would have  died rather than let the Spencervale people, among whom she had queened  it in her youth, suspect how poor she was and to what straits was  sometimes reduced. She much preferred to have them think her miserly and  odd--a queer old recluse who never went anywhere, even to church, and  who paid the smallest subscription to the minister's salary of anyone in  the congregation.    \"And her just rolling in wealth!\" they said indignantly. \"Well, she  didn't get her miserly ways from her parents. THEY were real generous  and neighbourly. There never was a finer gentleman than old Doctor  Lloyd. He was always doing kindnesses to everybody; and he had a way of  doing them that made you feel as if you was doing the favour, not him.  Well, well, let Old Lady Lloyd keep herself and her money to herself  if she wants to. If she doesn't want our company, she doesn't have to  suffer it, that's all. Reckon she isn't none too happy for all her money  and pride.\"    No, the Old Lady was none too happy, that was unfortunately true. It  is not easy to be happy when your life is eaten up with loneliness and  emptiness on the spiritual side, and when, on the material side, all you  have between you and starvation is the little money your hens bring you  in.    The Old Lady lived \"away back at the old Lloyd place,\" as it was always  called. It was a quaint, low-eaved house, with big chimneys and square  windows and with spruces growing thickly all around it. The Old Lady  lived there all alone and there were weeks at a time when she never saw  a human being except Crooked Jack. What the Old Lady did with herself  and how she put in her time was a puzzle the Spencervale people could  not solve. The children believed she amused herself counting the gold in  the big black box under her bed. Spencervale children held the Old Lady  in mortal terror; some of them--the \"Spencer Road\" fry--believed she  was a witch; all of them would run if, when wandering about the woods  in search of berries or spruce gum, they saw at a distance the spare,  upright form of the Old Lady, gathering sticks for her fire. Mary Moore  was the only one who was quite sure she was not a witch.    \"Witches are always ugly,\" she said decisively, \"and Old Lady Lloyd  isn't ugly. She's real pretty--she's got such a soft white hair and big  black eyes and a little white face. Those Road children don't know what  they're talking of. Mother says they're a very ignorant crowd.\"    \"Well, she doesn't ever go to church, and she mutters and talks to  herself all the time she's picking up sticks,\" maintained Jimmy Kimball  stoutly.    The Old Lady talked to herself because she was really very fond of  company and conversation. To be sure, when you have talked to nobody but  yourself for nearly twenty years, it is apt to grow somewhat monotonous;  and there were times when the Old Lady would have sacrificed everything  but her pride for a little human companionship. At such times she felt  very bitter and resentful toward Fate for having taken everything  from her. She had nothing to love, and that is about as unwholesome a  condition as is possible to anyone.    It was always hardest in the spring. Once upon a time the Old Lady--when  she had not been the Old Lady, but pretty, wilful, high-spirited  Margaret Lloyd--had loved springs; now she hated them because they hurt  her; and this particular spring of this particular May chapter hurt her  more than any that had gone before. The Old Lady felt as if she could  NOT endure the ache of it. Everything hurt her--the new green tips on  the firs, the fairy mists down in the little beech hollow below the  house, the fresh smell of the red earth Crooked Jack spaded up in her  garden. The Old Lady lay awake all one moonlit night and cried for very  heartache. She even forgot her body hunger in her soul hunger; and the  Old Lady had been hungry, more or less, all that week. She was living on  store biscuits and water, so that she might be able to pay Crooked Jack  for digging her garden. When the pale, lovely dawn-colour came stealing  up the sky behind the spruces, the Old Lady buried her face in her  pillow and refused to look at it.    \"I hate the new day,\" she said rebelliously. \"It will be just like all  the other hard, common days. I don't want to get up and live it. And,  oh, to think that long ago I reached out my hands joyfully to every  new day, as to a friend who was bringing me good tidings! I loved the  mornings then--sunny or gray, they were as delightful as an unread  book--and now I hate them--hate them--hate them!\"    But the Old Lady got up nevertheless, for she knew Crooked Jack would  be coming early to finish the garden. She arranged her beautiful, thick,  white hair very carefully, and put on her purple silk dress with the  little gold spots in it. The Old Lady always wore silk from motives of  economy. It was much cheaper to wear a silk dress that had belonged to  her mother than to buy new print at the store. The Old Lady had plenty  of silk dresses which had belonged to her mother. She wore them morning,  noon, and night, and Spencervale people considered it an additional  evidence of her pride. As for the fashion of them, it was, of course,  just because she was too mean to have them made over. They did not dream  that the Old Lady never put on one of the silk dresses without agonizing  over its unfashionableness, and that even the eyes of Crooked Jack cast  on her antique flounces and overskirts was almost more than her feminine  vanity could endure.    In spite of the fact that the Old Lady had not welcomed the new day, its  beauty charmed her when she went out for a walk after her dinner--or,  rather, after her mid-day biscuit. It was so fresh, so sweet, so virgin;  and the spruce woods around the old Lloyd place were athrill with busy  spring doings and all sprinkled through with young lights and shadows.  Some of their delight found its way into the Old Lady's bitter heart  as she wandered through them, and when she came out at the little plank  bridge over the brook down under the beeches, she felt almost gentle and  tender once more. There was one big beech there, in particular, which  the Old Lady loved for reasons best known to herself--a great, tall  beech with a trunk like the shaft of a gray marble column and a leafy  spread of branches over the still, golden-brown pool made beneath it by  the brook. It had been a young sapling in the days that were haloed by  the vanished glory of the Old Lady's life.    The Old Lady heard childish voices and laughter afar up the lane which  led to William Spencer's place just above the woods. William Spencer's  front lane ran out to the main road in a different direction, but this  \"back lane\" furnished a short cut and his children always went to school  that way.    The Old Lady shrank hastily back behind a clump of young spruces. She  did not like the Spencer children because they always seemed so afraid  of her. Through the spruce screen she could see them coming gaily down  the lane--the two older ones in front, the twins behind, clinging to the  hands of a tall, slim, young girl--the new music teacher, probably. The  Old Lady had heard from the egg pedlar that she was going to board at  William Spencer's, but she had not heard her name.    She looked at her with some curiosity as they drew near--and then, all  at once, the Old Lady's heart gave a great bound and began to beat as it  had not beaten for years, while her breath came quickly and she trembled  violently. Who--WHO could this girl be?    Under the new music teacher's straw hat were masses of fine chestnut  hair of the very shade and wave that the Old Lady remembered on another  head in vanished years; from under those waves looked large, violet-blue  eyes with very black lashes and brows--and the Old Lady knew those eyes  as well as she knew her own; and the new music teacher's face, with all  its beauty of delicate outline and dainty colouring and glad, buoyant  youth, was a face from the Old Lady's past--a perfect resemblance in  every respect save one; the face which the Old Lady remembered had  been weak, with all its charm; but this girl's face possessed a fine,  dominant strength compact of sweetness and womanliness. As she passed by  the Old Lady's hiding place she laughed at something one of the children  said; and oh, but the Old Lady knew that laughter well. She had heard it  before under that very beech tree.    She watched them until they disappeared over the wooded hill beyond the  bridge; and then she went back home as if she walked in a dream. Crooked  Jack was delving vigorously in the garden; ordinarily the Old Lady  did not talk much with Crooked Jack, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13545"],[0,"Mary at the Farm and Book of Recipes Compiled during Her Visit (#3)"],[1,"of tree trunks,  growing along the water's edge. Partly hidden by rocks along the bank  of the stream, nestled a few belated cup-shaped anemones or \"Wind  Flowers,\" from which most of the petals had blown, they being one of  the earliest messengers of Spring. Through the undergrowth in the  woods, in passing, could be seen the small buds of the azalea or wild  honeysuckle, \"Sheep's Laurel,\" the deep pink buds on the American  Judas tree, trailing vines of \"Tea Berry,\" and beneath dead leaves one  caught an occasional glimpse of fragrant, pink arbutus. In marshy  places beside the creek, swaying in the wind from slender stems, grew  straw-colored, bell-shaped blossoms of \"Adder's Tongue\" or \"Dog Tooth  Violet,\" with their mottled green, spike-shaped leaves. In the shadow  of a large rock grew dwarf huckleberry bushes, wild strawberry vines,  and among grasses of many varieties grew patches of white and  pink-tinted Alsatian clover.    Leaving behind the spicy, fragrant, \"woodsy\" smell of wintergreen,  birch and sassafras, and the faint, sweet scent of the creamy,  wax-like blossoms of \"Mandrake\" or May apple, peeping from beneath  large, umbrella-like, green leaves they emerged at last from the dim,  cool shadows of the woods into the warm, bright sunlight again.    Almost before Mary realized it, the farm house could be seen in the  distance, and her Uncle called her attention to his new, red barn,  which had been built since her last visit to the farm, and which, in  her Uncle's estimation, was of much greater importance than the house.    Mary greeted with pleasure the old landmarks so familiar to her on  former visits. They passed the small, stone school house at the  crossroads, and in a short time the horses turned obediently into the  lane leading to the barn a country lane in very truth, a tangle of  blackberry vines, wild rose bushes, by farmers called \"Pasture Roses,\"  interwoven with bushes of sumach, wild carrots and golden rod.    Mary insisted that her Uncle drive directly to the barn, as was his  usual custom, while she was warmly welcomed at the farm house gate by  her Aunt. As her Uncle led away the horses, he said, \"I will soon join  you, Mary, 'to break of our bread and eat of our salt,' as they say in  the 'Shrine.'\"    On their way to the house, Mary remarked: \"I am so glad we reached  here before dusk. The country is simply beautiful! Have you ever  noticed, Aunt Sarah, what a symphony in green is the yard? Look at the  buds on the maples and lilacs--a faint yellow green--and the  blue-green pine tree near by; the leaves of the German iris are  another shade; the grass, dotted with yellow dandelions, and blue  violets; the straight, grim, reddish-brown stalks of the peonies  before the leaves have unfolded, all roofed over with the  blossom-covered branches of pear, apple and 'German Prune' trees.  Truly, this must resemble Paradise!\"    \"Yes,\" assented her Aunt, \"I never knew blossoms to remain on the  pear trees so long a time. We have had no 'blossom shower' as yet to  scatter them, but there will be showers tonight, I think, or I am no  prophet. I feel rain in the atmosphere, and Sibylla said a few moments  ago she heard a 'rain bird' in the mulberry tree.\"    \"Aunt Sarah,\" inquired Mary, \"is the rhubarb large enough to use?\"    \"Yes, indeed, we have baked rhubarb pies and have had a surfeit of  dandelion salad or 'Salat,' as our neighbors designate it. Your Uncle  calls 'dandelion greens' the farmers' spring tonic; that and  'celadine,' that plant you see growing by the side of the house. Later  in the season it bears small, yellow flowers not unlike a very small  buttercup blossom, and it is said to be an excellent remedy for chills  and fevers, and it tastes almost as bitter as quinine. There are  bushels of dandelion blossoms, some of which we shall pick tomorrow,  and from them make dandelion wine.\"    \"And what use will my thrifty Aunt make of the blue violets?\"  mischievously inquired Mary.    \"The violets,\" replied her Aunt, \"I shall dig up carefully with some  earth adhering to their roots and place them in a glass bowl for a  centrepiece on the table for my artistic and beauty-loving niece; and  if kept moist, you will be surprised at the length of time they will  remain 'a thing of beauty' if not 'a joy forever.' And later, Mary,  from them I'll teach you to make violet beads.\"    \"Aunt Sarah, notice that large robin endeavoring to pull a worm from  the ground. Do you suppose the same birds return here from the South  every Summer?\"    \"Certainty, I do.\"    \"That old mulberry tree, from the berries of which you made such  delicious pies and marmalade last Summer, is it dead?\"    \"No; only late about getting its Spring outfit of leaves.\"          CHAPTER III.    SCHUGGENHAUS TOWNSHIP.      \"Schuggenhaus,\" said Sarah Landis, speaking to her niece, Mary  Midleton, \"is one of the largest and most populous townships in Bucks  County, probably so named by the early German settlers, some of whom,  I think, were my father's ancestors, as they came originally from  Zweibrucken, Germany, and settled in Schuggenhaus Township.  Schuggenhaus is one of the most fertile townships in Bucks County and  one of the best cultivated; farming is our principal occupation, and  the population of the township today is composed principally of the  descendants of well-to-do Germans, frequently called 'Pennsylvania  Dutch.'\"    \"I have often heard them called by that name,\" said Mary. \"Have you  forgotten, Aunt Sarah, you promised to tell me something interesting  about the first red clover introduced in Bucks County?\"    \"Red clover,\" replied her Aunt, \"that having bright, crimson-pink  heads, is the most plentiful and the most common variety of clover;  but knowing how abundantly it grows in different parts of the country  at the present time, one would scarcely have believed, in olden times,  that it would ever be so widely distributed as it now is.    \"One reason clover does so well in this country is that the  fertilization of the clover is produced by pollenation by the busy  little bumble-bee, who carries the pollen from blossom to blossom, and  clover is dependent upon these small insects for fertilization, as  without them clover would soon die out.\"    \"I admire the feathery, fuzzy, pink-tipped, rabbit-foot clover,\" said  Mary; \"it is quite fragrant, and usually covered with butterflies. It  makes such very pretty bouquets when you gather huge bunches of it.\"    [Illustration: THE OLD MILL WHEEL]    \"No, Mary, I think you are thinking of Alsatian clover, which is  similar to white clover. The small, round heads are cream color,  tinged with pink; it is very fragrant and sweet and grows along the  roadside and, like the common white clover, is a favorite with bees.  The yellow hop clover we also find along the roadside. As the heads of  clover mature, they turn yellowish brown and resemble dried hops;  sometimes yellow, brown and tan blossoms are seen on one branch. The  cultivation of red clover was introduced here a century ago, and when  in bloom the fields attracted great attention. Being the first ever  grown in this part of Bucks County, people came for miles to look at  it, the fence around the fields some days being lined with spectators,  I have been told by my grandfather. I remember when a child nothing  appeared to me more beautiful than my father's fields of flax; a mass  of bright blue flowers. I also remember the fields of broom-corn. Just  think! We made our own brooms, wove linen from the flax raised on our  farm and made our own tallow candles. Mary, from what a thrifty and  hard-working lot of ancestors you are descended! You inherit from your  mother your love of work and from your father your love of books. Your  father's uncle was a noted Shakespearean scholar.\"    Many old-time industries are passing away. Yet Sarah Landis, was a  housewife of the old school and still cooked apple butter, or \"Lodt  Varrik,\" as the Germans call it; made sauerkraut and hard soap, and  naked old-fashioned \"German\" rye bread on the hearth, which owed its  excellence not only to the fact of its being hearth baked but to the  rye flour being ground in an old mill in a near-by town, prepared by  the old process of grinding between mill-stones instead of the more  modern roller process. This picture of the old mill, taken by Fritz  Schmidt, shows it is not artistic, but, like most articles of German  manufacture, the mill was built more for its usefulness than to please  the eye.    [Illustration: THE OLD MILL]    \"Aunt Sarah, what is pumpernickel?\" inquired Mary, \"is it like rye  bread?\"    \"No, my dear, not exactly, it is a dark-colored bread, used in some  parts of Germany. Professor Schmidt tells me the bread is usually  composed of a mixture of barley flour and rye flour. Some I have eaten  looks very much like our own brown bread. Pumpernickel is considered a  very wholesome bread by the Germans--and I presume one might learn to  relish it, but I should prefer good, sweet, home-made rye bread. I  was told by an old gentleman who came to this country from Germany  when a boy, that pumpernickel was used in the German army years ago,  and was somewhat similar to 'hard tack,' furnished our soldiers in the  Civil War. But I cannot vouch for the truth of this assertion.\"    \"Aunt Sarah,\" said Mary later, \"Frau Schmidt tells me the Professor  sends his rye to the mill and requests that every part of it be ground  without separating--making what he calls 'whole rye flour,' and from  this Frau Schmidt bakes wholesome, nutritious bread which they call  'pumpernickel,' She tells me she uses about one-third of this 'whole  rye flour' to two-thirds white bread flour when baking bread, and she  considers bread made from this whole grain more wholesome and  nutritious than the bread made from our fine rye flour.\"          CHAPTER IV.
