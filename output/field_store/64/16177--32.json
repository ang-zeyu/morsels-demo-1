Now, each receptor can be adequately stimulated  only by the particular factor or factors in the environment  which created the necessity for the existence of that receptor.  Thus there have arisen receptors for touch, for temperature,  for pain, etc.  The receptors for pain have been designated _nociceptors_  (nocuous or harmful) by Sherrington.    On the basis of natural selection, nociceptors could have developed  in only those regions of the body which have been exposed to injury  during long periods of time.  On this ground the finger, because it  is exposed, should have many nociceptors, while the brain, though the  most important organ of the body, should have no nociceptors because,  during a vast period of time, it has been protected by a skull.  Realizing that this point is a crucial one, Dr. Sloan and I made a series  of careful experiments.  The cerebral hemispheres of dogs were exposed  by removing the skull and dura under ether and local anesthesia.  Then various portions of the hemispheres were slowly but  completely destroyed by rubbing them with pieces of gauze.  In some instances a hemisphere was destroyed by burning.  In no case was there more than a slight response of the centers governing  circulation and respiration, and no morphologic change was noted  in an histologic study of the brain-cells of the uninjured hemisphere.  The experiment was as completely negative as were the experiments  on the \"spinal dog.\"  Clinically I have confirmed these experimental  findings when I have explored the brains of conscious patients  with a probe to determine the presence of brain tumors.  Such explorations elicited neither pain nor any evidence of altered  physiologic functions.  The brain, therefore, contains no mechanism--  no nociceptors--the direct stimulation of which can cause  a discharge of nervous energy in a self-defensive action.  That is to say, direct injury of the brain can cause no purposeful  nerve-muscular action, while direct injury of the finger does cause  purposeful nerve-muscular action.  In like manner, the deeper portions  of the spinal region have been sheltered from trauma and they, too,  show but little power of causing a discharge of nervous energy  on receiving trauma.  The various tissues and organs of the body  are differently endowed with injury receptors--the nociceptors  of Sherrington.  The abdomen and chest when traumatized stand first  in their facility for causing the discharge of nervous energy, _i.  e_., THEY STAND FIRST IN SHOCK PRODUCTION.  Then follow the extremities,  the neck, and the back.  It is an interesting fact also that different  types of trauma elicit different responses as far as the consequent  discharge of energy is concerned.    Because it is such a commonplace observation, one scarcely realizes  the importance of the fact that clean-cut wounds inflicted  by a razor-like knife cause the least reaction, while a tearing,  crushing trauma causes the greatest response.  It is a suggestive fact  that the greatest shock is produced by any technic which imitates  the methods of attack and of slaughter used by the carnivora.  _*In the course of evolution, injuries thus produced may well have  been the predominating type of traumata to which our progenitors  were subjected_.  In one particular respect there is an analogy between  the response to trauma of some parts of the body of the individuals  of a species susceptible to shock and the response to trauma of the  individuals in certain other great divisions of the animal kingdom.  Natural selection has protected the crustaceans against their  enemies by protective armor, _e.  g_., the turtle and the armadillo;  to the birds, it has given sharp eyes and wings, as, for instance,  the wild goose to another species--the skunk--it has given a noisome odor  for its protection.  The turtle, protected by its armor against trauma,  is in a very similar position to that of the sheltered brain  of man and, like the brain, the turtle does not respond to trauma  by an especially active self-protective nerve-muscular response,  but merely withdraws its head and legs within the armored protection.  It is proverbially difficult to exhaust or to kill this animal by trauma.  The brain and other phylogenetically sheltered parts likewise give no  exhausting self-protective nerve-muscular response to trauma.  The skunk  is quite effectively protected from violence by its peculiar odor.  This is indicated not only by the protective value of the odor itself,  but also by the fact that the skunk has no efficient nerve-muscular  mechanism for escape or defense; it can neither run fast nor can it  climb a tree.  Moreover, in encounters it shows no fear and backs  rather than runs.  The armadillo rolls itself into a ball for defense.  On these premises we should conclude that the turtle,  the armadillo, and the skunk have fewer nociceptors than has  a dog or man, and that they would show less response to trauma.  In two carefully conducted experiments on skunks and two on armadillos  (an insufficient number) the energy discharged in response to severe  and protracted trauma of the abdominal viscera was very much less than  in similar experiments on dogs, opossums, pigs, sheep, and rabbits.  It was indeed relatively difficult to exhaust the skunks and armadillos  by trauma.  These experiments are too few to be conclusive,  but they are of some value and furnish an excellent lead.  It seems more than a coincidence that proneness to fear,  distribution of nociceptors, and susceptibility to shock go  hand-in-hand in these comparative observations (Figs. 6, 7, and 8).    The discharge of energy caused by an adequate mechanical stimulation  of the nociceptors is best explained in accordance with the law  of phylogenetic association.  That is, injuries awaken those reflex  actions which by natural selection have been developed for the purpose  of self-protection. Adequate stimulation of the nociceptors for pain  is not the only means by which a discharge of nervous energy is caused.  Nervous energy may be discharged also by adequate stimulation  of the various ticklish regions of the body; the entire skin  surface of the body contains delicate ticklish receptors.  These receptors are closely related to the nociceptors for pain,  and their adequate stimulation by an insect-like touch  causes a discharge of energy,--a nerve-muscular reaction,--  resembling that developed for the purpose of brushing off insects.  This reflex is similar to the scratch reflex in the dog.  The discharge of energy is almost wholly independent of the will  and is a self-protective action in the same sense as is the response  to pain stimuli.  The ear in man and in animals is acutely ticklish,  the adequate stimulus being any foreign body, especially a buzzing,  insect-like contact.  The discharge of nervous energy in horses  and in cattle on adequate stimulation of the ticklish receptors  of the ear is so extraordinary that in the course of evolution it  must have been of great importance to the safety of the animal.  A similar ticklish zone guards the nasal chambers, the discharge of energy  here taking a form which effectively dislodges the foreign body.  The larynx is exquisitely ticklish, and, in response to any adequate  stimulus, energy is discharged in the production of a vigorous cough.  The mouth and pharynx have active receptors which cause the rejection  of noxious substances.  The conjunctival reflex, though not  classed as ticklish, is a most efficient self-protective reflex.  I assume that there is no doubt as to the relation between  the adequate stimuli and the nerve-muscular response of the various  ticklish receptors of the surface of the skin, of the ear,  the nose, the eye, and the larynx.  These mechanisms were developed  by natural selection as protective measures against the intrusion  of insects and foreign bodies into regions of great importance.  The discharge of energy in these instances is in accordance  with the laws of inheritance and association.  The other ticklish  points which are capable of discharging vast amounts of energy  are the lateral chest-wall, the abdomen, the loins, the neck,  and the soles of the feet.  The type of adequate stimuli of the soles  of the feet, the distribution of the ticklish points upon them,  and the associated response, leave no doubt that these ticklish points  were long ago established as a means of protection from injury.  Under present conditions they are of little value to man.    The adequate stimulus for the ticklish points of the ribs,  the loins, the abdomen, and the neck is deep isolated pressure,  probably the most adequate being pressure by a tooth-shaped body.  The response to tickling in these regions is actively and obviously  self-defensive. The horse discharges energy in the form of a kick;  the dog wriggles and makes a counter-bite; the man makes efforts  at defense and escape.    There is strong evidence that the deep ticklish points of the body  were developed through vast periods of fighting with teeth and claws  (Fig. 9). Even puppies at play bite each other in their ticklish  points and thus give a recapitulation of their ancestral battles  and of the real battles to come (Fig. 10). The mere fact that animals  fight effectively in the dark and always according to the habit  of their species supports the belief that the fighting of animals  is not an intellectual but a reflex process.  There are no rules  which govern the conduct of a fight between animals.  The events  follow each other with such kaleidoscopic rapidity that the process  is but a series of automatic stimulations and physiologic reactions.  Whatever their significance, therefore, it is certain that man did  not come either accidentally or without purpose into possession  of the deep ticklish regions of his chest and abdomen.
