All movements are relative  to something else, and what we have to do with a stream of water in a  turbine is to reduce its velocity relatively to the earth, quite a  different thing to its velocity in relation to the turbine; for while the  one may be zero, the other may be anything we please. ABCD in Fig. 1  represents a parallelogram of velocities, wherein AC gives the direction of  a jet of water starting at A, and arriving at C at the end of one second or  any other division of time. At a scale of 1/40 in. to 1 ft., AC represents  80 ft., the fall due to 100 ft. head, or at a scale of 1 in. to 1 ft., AC  gives 2 ft., or the distance traveled by the same stream in 1/40 of a  second. The velocity AC may be resolved into two others, namely, AB and AD,  or BC, which are found to be 69.28 ft. and 40 ft. respectively, when the  angle BAC--generally called _x_ in treatises on turbines--is 30 deg. If,  however, AC is taken at 2 ft., then A B will be found = 20.78 in., and BC =  12 in. for a time of 1/40 or 0.025 of a second. Supposing now a flat plate,  BC = 12 in. wide move from DA to CB during 0.025 second, it will be readily  seen that a drop of water starting from A will have arrived at C in 0.025  second, having been flowing along the surface BC from B to C without either  friction or loss of velocity. If now, instead of a straight plate, BC, we  substitute one having a concave surface, such as BK in Fig. 2, it will be  found necessary to move it from A to L in 0.025 second, in order to allow a  stream to arrive at C, that is K, without, in transit, friction or loss of  velocity. This concave surface may represent one bucket of a turbine.  Supposing now a resistance to be applied to that it can only move from A to  B instead of to L. Then, as we have already resolved the velocity A C into  AB and BC, so far as the former (AB) is concerned, no alteration occurs  whether BK be straight or curved. But the other portion, BC, pressing  vertically against the concave surface, BK, becomes gradually diminished in  its velocity in relation to the earth, and produces and effect known as  \"reaction.\" A combined operation of impact and reaction occurs by further  diminishing the distance which the bucket is allowed to travel, as, for  examples, to EF. Here the jet is impelled against the lower edge of the  bucket, B, and gives a pressure by its impact; then following the curve BK,  with a diminishing velocity, it is finally discharged at K, retaining only  sufficient movement to carry the water clear out of the machine. Thus far  we have considered the movement of jets and buckets along AB as straight  lines, but this can only occur, so far as buckets are concerned, when their  radius in infinite. In practice these latter movements are always curves of  more or less complicated form, which effect a considerable modification in  the forms of buckets, etc., but not in the general principles, and it is  the duty of the designer of any form of turbine to give this consideration  its due importance. Having thus cleared away any ambiguity from the terms  \"impact,\" and \"reaction,\" and shown how they can act independently or  together, we shall be able to follow the course and behavior of streams in  a turbine, and by treating their effects as arising from two separate  causes, we shall be able to regard the problem without that inevitable  confusion which arises when they are considered as acting conjointly.  Turbines, though driven by vast volumes of water, are in reality impelled  by countless isolated jets, or streams, all acting together, and a clear  understanding of the behavior of any one of these facilitates and concludes  a solution of the whole problem.    _Experimental researches_.--All experiments referred to in this paper were  made by jets of water under an actual vertical head of 45 ft., but as the  supply came through a considerable length of 1/2 in. bore lead piping, and  many bends, a large and constant loss occurred through friction and bends,  so that the actual working head was only known by measuring the velocity of  discharge. This was easily done by allowing all the water to flow into a  tank of known capacity. The stop cock had a clear circular passage through  it, and two different jets were used. One oblong measured 0.5 in. by 0.15  in., giving an area of 0.075 square inch. The other jet was circular, and  just so much larger than 1/4 in. to be 0.05 of a square inch area, and the  stream flowed with a velocity of 40 ft. per second, corresponding to a head  of 25 ft. Either nozzle could be attached to the same universal joint, and  directed at any desired inclination upon the horizontal surface of a  special well-adjusted compound weighing machine, or into various bent tubes  and other attachments, so that all pressures, whether vertical or  horizontal, could be accurately ascertained and reduced to the unit, which  was the quarter of an ounce. The vertical component _p_ of any pressure P  may be ascertained by the formula--        _p_ = P sin alpha,    where alpha is the angle made by a jet against a surface; and in order to  test the accuracy of the simple machinery employed for these researches,  the oblong jet which gave 71 unit when impinging vertically upon a circular  plate, was directed at 60 deg. and 45 deg. thereon, with results shown in  Table I., and these, it will be observed, are sufficiently close to theory  to warrant reliance being placed on data obtained from the simple weighing  machinery used in the experiment.                     _Table I.--Impact on Level Plate._  --------------+--------------------+----------+----------+----------                | Inclination of jet |          |          |    Distance.   | to the horizonal.  |  90 deg. |  60 deg. |  45 deg.  --------------+--------------------+----------+----------+----------                |                    | Pressure | Pressure | Pressure                |                    |          |          |              / |  Experiment    \\   |        / |   61.00  |   49.00   11/2 in.    <  |                 >  | 71.00 <  |          |              \\ |  Theory        /   |        \\ |   61.48  |   50.10                |                    |          |          |                |                    |          |          |              / |  Experiment    \\   |        / |   55.00  |   45.00   1 in.     <  |                 >  | 63.00 <  |          |              \\ |  Theory        /   |        \\ |   54.00  |   45.00                |                    |          |          |  --------------+--------------------+----------+----------+----------               In each case the unit of pressure is 1/4 oz.    In the first trial there was a distance of 11/2 in. between the jet and point  of its contact with the plate, while in the second trial this space was  diminished to 1/2 in. It will be noticed that as this distance increases we  have augmented pressures, and these are not due, as might be supposed, to  increase of head, which is practically nothing, but they are due to the  recoil of a portion of the stream, which occurs increasingly as it becomes  more and more broken up. These alterations in pressure can only be  eliminated when care is taken to measure that only due to impact, without  at the same time adding the effect of an imperfect reaction. Any stream  that can run off at all points from a smooth surface gives the minimum of  pressure thereon, for then the least resistance is offered to the  destruction of the vertical element of its velocity, but this freedom  becomes lost when a stream is diverted into a confined channel. As pressure  is an indication and measure of lost velocity, we may then reasonably look  for greater pressure on the scale when a stream is confined after impact  than when it discharges freely in every direction. Experimentally this is  shown to be the case, for when the same oblong jet, discharged under the  same conditions, impinged vertically upon a smooth plate, and gave a  pressure of 71 units, gave 87 units when discharged into a confined  right-angled channel. This result emphasizes the necessity for confining  streams of water whenever it is desired to receive the greatest pressure by  arresting their velocity. Such streams will always endeavor to escape in  the directions of least resistance, and, therefore, in a turbine means  should be provided to prevent any lateral deviation of the streams while  passing through their buckets. So with screw propellers the great mass of  surrounding water may be regarded as acting like a channel with elastic  sides, which permits the area enlarging as the velocity of a current  passing diminishes. The experiments thus far described have been made with  jets of an oblong shape, and they give results differing in some degree  from those obtained with circular jets. Yet as the general conclusions from  both are found the same, it will avoid unnecessary prolixity by using the  data from experiments made with a circular jet of 0.05 square inch area,  discharging a stream at the rate of 40 ft. per second. This amounts to 52  lb. of water per minute with an available head of 25 ft., or 1,300  foot-pounds per minute. The tubes which received and directed the course of  this jet were generally of lead, having a perfectly smooth internal  surface, for it was found that with a rougher surface the flow of water is  retarded, and changes occur in the data obtained. Any stream having its  course changed presses against the body causing such change, this pressure  increasing in proportion to the angle through which the change is made, and  also according to the radius of a curve around which it flows. This fact  has long been known to hydraulic engineers, and formulae exist by which such  pressures can be determined; nevertheless, it will be useful to study these  relations from a somewhat different point of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11740"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 13, No. 364, April (#3)"],[1,"  bring myself always to analyze the motives of people's actions; and if  Mrs. Welborn _really_ desired, in lieu of acting mamma to children she  did not possess, to play the part of gouvernante to a couple of wild,  uncouth lads, (her nephews,) during their residence in college, it speaks  much for her good nature, at all events. They were not, I believe,  grateful for the means she adopted to display this amiable trait in her  disposition, nor did people in general appreciate it as they surely ought  to have done. _Ill nature_--and there is often a frightful preponderance  of _that_ quality in a small town--did not hesitate to assert that the  widow Welborn's motive for pitching her tent amid scholastic shades was  _in toto_ a _selfish_ one; even that of a design, if she could but  accomplish it, of adding _another_ self to _self_. I dare not, in this  era of refinement, speak plainer, but will take for granted that I am  understood. The widow Welborn, or, as she was more commonly termed. \"The  gay Widow\" from certain gregarious propensities, resided with a couple of  female servants in a small house, situated in the most public street of  the town; which I know, for this reason,--the principal court of our  college was opposite to it, and its gateway was the approved lounge, from  morning till night, of the most idle and impudent amongst us. Various  were the surmises as to _who, what,_ and from _whence_ the gay widow was;  by many she was supposed to be immensely rich; and by a few, some lady of  quality _incog_. Many, however, asserted, that her jewels were glass; her  gold, tinsel, and her glittering ornaments, beads sewed upon pasteboard.  Nevertheless, in the very face of this shameful detraction, to her  delightful little soirees flocked the best families in the town, (there  were not many,) the heads of houses, (scarcely room had they in her  mansion for their bodies,) and many a, fellow, senior and junior, of many  a college in----. I had the honour of attending sometimes at these  parties, of which all that I remember at present is, that the sugar was  nipped into pieces so small, as to oblige those who liked their tea sweet  to put in two or three spoonsfull, instead of an equal _quantum_ of  lumps, to the astonishment and visible dismay of the waiters. There was  generally, too, a sad deficiency in cake; and, oh! when the negus was  handed round,----Well, perhaps her nephews drew largely upon her stock of  wine; or the widow possibly thought her young men got too much of that  commodity in _our_ parties, and therefore needed it less in her own. As  to the senior members of the university, I never could comprehend the  reasons that induced their endurance of such an aqueous beverage.  Sometimes I have attributed their visits to Mrs. Welborn's merely to a  ramification of that system of espionage which she thought proper to  employ upon her nephews, and they to extend indiscriminately towards  every undergraduate; whereas being myself a well-intentioned, modest  young man, mine own honour has seemed grievously insulted; but again, may  not _vanity_, the hope, paramount in the breast of every individual, of  being admired by \"_a fortune_,\" have influenced these old gentlemen to  swallow lukewarm potations, (_minus_ wine, lemon, and sugar,) which were  a kind of nutmeg broth? I can certainly aver, that old Rightangle, of our  college, was, or pretended to be, desperately enamoured with the gay  widow; indeed, his doleful looks at one period, and his shyness of the  fair lady in question, were to me pretty evident proofs that he had made  her an offer, which had been _rejected_. The gossips of ---- had long set  it down as a match, but were, it seems, doomed to be disappointed of  their cake and wine. I honestly believe that the widow _hated_  Rightangle; and conscientiously declare, to the best of my knowledge,  that her antipathy towards my very excellent tutor arose from the  circumstance of his having a large red nose, and winning her money  whenever they played at the same card-table. Strange stories were afloat  respecting the _menage_ of Mrs. Welborn; my bed-maker affirmed, upon her  (?) honour and veracity, that a lady and gentleman, who had favoured her  with a visit, had quitted her residence thrice thinner than they were  when they entered it; and that a gentleman had hastily departed from the  shelter of her hospitable roof, upon her refusing him the indulgence of a  _Welsh rabbit_ at _breakfast!_ These, and similar tales, were promulgated  by the treacherous industry of the widow's maid-servants. Mrs. Welborn  was fond of claiming an intimate acquaintance with people of rank. I  never, however, met any titled person at her house. She was a kind of  living peerage, and an animated chronicle of the actions of the great,  virtuous and vicious: but, if the truth must be spoken,--and in a private  memoir, why conceal it?--she _had_ acquaintances of a grade far inferior!  I say not that _I_ saw it, because I was never accustomed to lounge at  our college gate; but the men that were most frequently there, _insist_  that they have many times beheld the gay widow steal forth in the dusk of  the evening, dressed as for a party, and have tracked her to the house of  a haberdasher in the vicinity! Well! she is married now, and is Mrs.  Welborn--the _gay widow_ no longer. How she accomplished this affair I  know not; it broke like a thunder-clap upon the ears of the good people  of--. Suddenly, the widow was gone--her house and furniture were  sold--_the_ happy event was announced in the papers--no cake was sent  out--so the gossips were disappointed; and as I have since learnt, that  the lady has _thrice_ undergone a separation from her husband, I imagine  that she must have been so likewise.

This beautiful little volume has, in less than six months, reached a  fourth edition, which is to us a proof that the readers of the present  day know how to discriminate pure gold from pinchbeck or _petit or_, and  intense, natural feeling from the tinsel and tissues of flimsy \"poetry.\"  The booksellers, nevertheless, say that poetry is unsaleable, and they  are usually allowed to speak feelingly on the score of popularity and  success. Yet within a very short time, we have seen a splendid poem--the  \"Pelican Island,\" by (_the_) Montgomery; the \"Course of Time,\" a Miltonic  composition, by the Rev. Mr. Pollock; and now we have before us a poem,  of which on an average, an edition has been sold in six weeks. The  sweeping censure that poems are unsaleable belongs then to a certain  grade of poetry which ought never to have strayed out of the album in  which it was first written, except for the benefit of the stationer,  printer, and the newspapers. Nearly all the poetry of this description is  too _bizarre_, and wants the pathos and deep feeling which uniformly  characterize true poetry, and have a lasting impression on the reader:  whereas, all the \"initial\" celebrity, the honied sweetness, lasts but for  a few months, and then drops into oblivion.    The story of the Sorrows of Rosalie (there's music in the name) is not of  uncommon occurrence; would to heaven it were more rare. Rosalie, won by  her omnipotent lover, Arthur, leaves her aged father; is deceived by  promises of marriage, and at length deserted by her seducer. She seeks  her betrayer in London, (where the many-headed monster, vice, may best  conceal herself,) is repulsed, and after enduring all the bitterness of  cruelty, hunger, and remorse, she returns to her father's house; but  nothing of him and his remains but his memory and his tomb. She is then  driven to dishonesty to supply the cravings of her child--is tried and  acquitted. During her imprisonment, the child dies; distress brings on  her temporary insanity; but she at length flies to a secluded part of the  country, and there seeks a solace for her miseries in making peace with  her offended Maker.    We can only detach a few portions of the poem, just to show the intensity  with which even common scenes and occurrences are worked up. Here is a  picture of Rosalie's happy home:      Home of my childhood! quiet, peaceful home!    Where innocence sat smiling on my brow,    Why did I leave thee, willingly to roam,    Lured by a traitor's vainly-trusted vow?    Could they, the fond and happy, see me _now_,    Who knew me when life's early summer smiled,    They would not know 'twas I, or marvel how    The laughing thing, half woman and half child,    Could e'er be changed to form so squalid, wan, and wild.      I _was_ most happy--witness it, ye skies,    That watched the slumbers of my peaceful night!    Till each succeeding morning saw me rise    With cheerful song, and heart for ever light;    No heavy gems--no jewel, sparkling bright,    Cumbered the tresses nature's self had twined;    Nor festive torches glared before my sight;    Unknowing and unknown, with peaceful mind,    Blest in the lot I knew, none else I wished to find.      I _had_ a father--a gray-haired old man,    Whom Fortune's sad reverses keenly tried;    And now his dwindling life's remaining span,    Locked up in me the little left of pride,    And knew no hope, no joy, no care beside.    My father!--dare I say I loved him well?    I, who could leave him to a hireling guide?    Yet all my thoughts were _his_, and bitterer fell    The pangs of leaving _him_, than all I have to tell.      And oh! my childhood's home was lovelier far    Than all the stranger homes where I have been;    It seem'd as if each pale and twinkling star    Loved to shine out upon so fair a scene;    Never were flowers so sweet, or fields so green,    As those that wont that lonely cot to grace    If, as tradition tells, this earth has seen    "]]]
