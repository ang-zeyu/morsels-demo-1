Therefore he knew very well that they were watching him  while he was watching them.    In proof of this, Ugu sprang from his seat and turned a scowling face  in their direction; but now he could not see the travelers who were  seeking him, although they could still see him.  His actions were so  distinct, indeed, that it seemed he was actually before them.  \"It is  only a ghost,\" said the Bear King.  \"It isn't real at all except that  it shows us Ugu just as he looks and tells us truly just what he is  doing.\"    \"I don't see anything of my lost growl, though,\" said Toto as if to  himself.    Then the vision faded away, and they could see nothing but the grass  and trees and bushes around them.          CHAPTER 18    THE CONFERENCE      \"Now then,\" said the Wizard, \"let us talk this matter over and decide  what to do when we get to Ugu's wicker castle.  There can be no doubt  that the Shoemaker is a powerful Magician, and his powers have been  increased a hundredfold since he secured the Great Book of Records, the  Magic Picture, all of Glinda's recipes for sorcery, and my own black  bag, which was full of tools of wizardry.  The man who could rob us of  those things and the man with all their powers at his command is one  who may prove somewhat difficult to conquer, therefore we should plan  our actions well before we venture too near to his castle.\"    \"I didn't see Ozma in the Magic Picture,\" said Trot. \"What do you  suppose Ugu has done with her?\"    \"Couldn't the Little Pink Bear tell us what he did with Ozma?\" asked  Button-Bright.    \"To be sure,\" replied the Lavender King.  \"I'll ask him.\"  So he turned  the crank in the Little Pink Bear's side and inquired, \"Did Ugu the  Shoemaker steal Ozma of Oz?\"    \"Yes,\" answered the Little Pink Bear.    \"Then what did he do with her?\" asked the King.    \"Shut her up in a dark place,\" answered the Little Pink Bear.    \"Oh, that must be a dungeon cell!\" cried Dorothy, horrified.  \"How  dreadful!\"    \"Well, we must get her out of it,\" said the Wizard. \"That is what we  came for, and of course we must rescue Ozma.  But how?\"    Each one looked at some other one for an answer, and all shook their  heads in a grave and dismal manner.  All but Scraps, who danced around  them gleefully.  \"You're afraid,\" said the Patchwork Girl, \"because so  many things can hurt your meat bodies. Why don't you give it up and go  home?  How can you fight a great magician when you have nothing to  fight with?\"    Dorothy looked at her reflectively.    \"Scraps,\" said she, \"you know that Ugu couldn't hurt you a bit,  whatever he did, nor could he hurt ME, 'cause I wear the Gnome King's  Magic Belt.  S'pose just we two go on together and leave the others  here to wait for us.\"    \"No, no!\" said the Wizard positively. \"That won't do at all.  Ozma is  more powerful than either of you, yet she could not defeat the wicked  Ugu, who has shut her up in a dungeon.  We must go to the Shoemaker in  one mighty band, for only in union is there strength.\"    \"That is excellent advice,\" said the Lavender Bear approvingly.    \"But what can we do when we get to Ugu?\" inquired the Cookie Cook  anxiously.    \"Do not expect a prompt answer to that important question,\" replied the  Wizard, \"for we must first plan our line of conduct.  Ugu knows, of  course, that we are after him, for he has seen our approach in the  Magic Picture, and he has read of all we have done up to the present  moment in the Great Book of Records.  Therefore we cannot expect to  take him by surprise.\"    \"Don't you suppose Ugu would listen to reason?\" asked Betsy.  \"If we  explained to him how wicked he has been, don't you think he'd let poor  Ozma go?\"    \"And give me back my dishpan?\" added the Cookie Cook eagerly.    \"Yes, yes, won't he say he's sorry and get on his knees and beg our  pardon?\" cried Scraps, turning a flip-flop to show her scorn of the  suggestion.  \"When Ugu the Shoemaker does that, please knock at the  front door and let me know.\"    The Wizard sighed and rubbed his bald head with a puzzled air.  \"I'm  quite sure Ugu will not be polite to us,\" said he, \"so we must conquer  this cruel magician by force, much as we dislike to be rude to anyone.  But none of you has yet suggested a way to do that.  Couldn't the  Little Pink Bear tell us how?\" he asked, turning to the Bear King.    \"No, for that is something that is GOING to happen,\" replied the  Lavender Bear.  \"He can only tell us what already HAS happened.\"    Again, they were grave and thoughtful.  But after a time, Betsy said in  a hesitating voice, \"Hank is a great fighter.  Perhaps HE could conquer  the magician.\"    The Mule turned his head to look reproachfully at his old friend, the  young girl.  \"Who can fight against magic?\" he asked.    \"The Cowardly Lion could,\" said Dorothy.    The Lion, who was lying with his front legs spread out, his chin on his  paws, raised his shaggy head.  \"I can fight when I'm not afraid,\" said  he calmly, \"but the mere mention of a fight sets me to trembling.\"    \"Ugu's magic couldn't hurt the Sawhorse,\" suggested tiny Trot.    \"And the Sawhorse couldn't hurt the Magician,\" declared that wooden  animal.    \"For my part,\" said Toto, \"I am helpless, having lost my growl.\"    \"Then,\" said Cayke the Cookie Cook, \"we must depend upon the Frogman.  His marvelous wisdom will surely inform him how to conquer the wicked  Magician and restore to me my dishpan.\"    All eyes were now turned questioningly upon the Frogman.  Finding  himself the center of observation, he swung his gold-headed cane,  adjusted his big spectacles, and after swelling out his chest, sighed  and said in a modest tone of voice:    \"Respect for truth obliges me to confess that Cayke is mistaken in  regard to my superior wisdom.  I am not very wise.  Neither have I had  any practical experience in conquering magicians.  But let us consider  this case. What is Ugu, and what is a magician?  Ugu is a renegade  shoemaker, and a magician is an ordinary man who, having learned how to  do magical tricks, considers himself above his fellows.  In this case,  the Shoemaker has been naughty enough to steal a lot of magical tools  and things that did not belong to him, and he is more wicked to steal  than to be a magician.  Yet with all the arts at his command, Ugu is  still a man, and surely there are ways in which a man may be conquered.  How, do you say, how?  Allow me to state that I don't know.  In my  judgment, we cannot decide how best to act until we get to Ugu's castle.  So let us go to it and take a look at it. After that, we may discover  an idea that will guide us to victory.\"    \"That may not be a wise speech, but it sounds good,\" said Dorothy  approvingly.  \"Ugu the Shoemaker is not only a common man, but he's a  wicked man and a cruel man and deserves to be conquered.  We mustn't  have any mercy on him till Ozma is set free.  So let's go to his castle  as the Frogman says and see what the place looks like.\"    No one offered any objection to this plan, and so it was adopted. They  broke camp and were about to start on the journey to Ugu's castle when  they discovered that Button-Bright was lost again.  The girls and the  Wizard shouted his name, and the Lion roared and the Donkey brayed and  the Frogman croaked and the Big Lavender Bear growled (to the envy of  Toto, who couldn't growl but barked his loudest), yet none of them  could make Button-Bright hear.  So after vainly searching for the boy a  full hour, they formed a procession and proceeded in the direction of  the wicker castle of Ugu the Shoemaker.    \"Button-Bright's always getting lost,\" said Dorothy.  \"And if he wasn't  always getting found again, I'd prob'ly worry.  He may have gone ahead  of us, and he may have gone back, but wherever he is, we'll find him  sometime and somewhere, I'm almost sure.\"          CHAPTER 19    UGU THE SHOEMAKER      A curious thing about Ugu the Shoemaker was that he didn't suspect in  the least that he was wicked.  He wanted to be powerful and great, and  he hoped to make himself master of all the Land of Oz that he might  compel everyone in that fairy country to obey him, His ambition blinded  him to the rights of others, and he imagined anyone else would act just  as he did if anyone else happened to be as clever as himself.    When he inhabited his little shoemaking shop in the City of Herku, he  had been discontented, for a shoemaker is not looked upon with high  respect, and Ugu knew that his ancestors had been famous magicians for  many centuries past and therefore his family was above the ordinary.  Even his father practiced magic when Ugu was a boy, but his father had  wandered away from Herku and had never come back again.  So when Ugu  grew up, he was forced to make shoes for a living, knowing nothing of  the magic of his forefathers. But one day, in searching through the  attic of his house, he  discovered all the books of magical recipes and  many magical instruments which had formerly been in use in his family.  From that day, he stopped making shoes and began to study magic.  Finally, he aspired to become the greatest magician in Oz, and for days  and weeks and months he thought on a plan to render all the other  sorcerers and wizards, as well as those with fairy powers, helpless to  oppose him.    From the books of his ancestors, he learned the following facts:    (1) That Ozma of Oz was the fairy ruler of the Emerald City and the  Land of Oz and that she could not be destroyed by any magic ever  devised.  Also, by means of her Magic Picture she would be able to  discover anyone who approached her royal palace with the idea of  conquering it.

He complained bitterly because I had given him but one  arm--as if it were my fault!--and he grumbled because the suit of blue  Munchkin clothes, which I got for him from a neighbor, did not fit him  perfectly.\"    \"Ah, that was because he was wearing my old head,\" remarked the Tin  Soldier. \"I remember that head used to be very particular about its  clothes.\"    \"As an assistant,\" the old tinsmith continued, \"Chopfyt was not a  success. He was awkward with tools and was always hungry. He demanded  something to eat six or eight times a day, so I wondered if I had  fitted his insides properly. Indeed, Chopfyt ate so much that little  food was left for myself; so, when he proposed, one day, to go out into  the world and seek adventures, I was delighted to be rid of him. I even  made him a tin arm to take the place of the missing one, and that  pleased him very much, so that we parted good friends.\"    \"What became of Chopfyt after that?\" the Scarecrow inquired.    \"I never heard. He started off toward the east, into the plains of the  Munchkin Country, and that was the last I ever saw of him.\"    \"It seems to me,\" said the Tin Woodman reflectively, \"that you did  wrong in making a man out of our cast-off parts. It is evident that  Chopfyt could, with justice, claim relationship with both of us.\"    \"Don't worry about that,\" advised Ku-Klip cheerfully; \"it is not likely  that you will ever meet the fellow. And, if you should meet him, he  doesn't know who he is made of, for I never told him the secret of his  manufacture. Indeed, you are the only ones who know of it, and you may  keep the secret to yourselves, if you wish to.\"    \"Never mind Chopfyt,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Our business now is to find  poor Nimmie Amee and let her choose her tin husband. To do that, it  seems, from the information Ku-Klip has given us, we must travel to  Mount Munch.\"    \"If that's the programme, let us start at once,\" suggested Woot.    So they all went outside, where they found Polychrome dancing about  among the trees and talking with the birds and laughing as merrily as  if she had not lost her Rainbow and so been separated from all her  fairy sisters.    They told her they were going to Mount Munch, and she replied:    \"Very well; I am as likely to find my Rainbow there as here, and any  other place is as likely as there. It all depends on the weather. Do  you think it looks like rain?\"    They shook their heads, and Polychrome laughed again and danced on  after them when they resumed their journey.          Chapter Nineteen    The Invisible Country      They were proceeding so easily and comfortably on their way to Mount  Munch that Woot said in a serious tone of voice:    \"I'm afraid something is going to happen.\"    \"Why?\" asked Polychrome, dancing around the group of travelers.    \"Because,\" said the boy, thoughtfully, \"I've noticed that when we have  the least reason for getting into trouble, something is sure to go  wrong. Just now the weather is delightful; the grass is beautifully  blue and quite soft to our feet; the mountain we are seeking shows  clearly in the distance and there is no reason anything should happen  to delay us in getting there. Our troubles all seem to be over,  and--well, that's why I'm afraid,\" he added, with a sigh.    \"Dear me!\" remarked the Scarecrow, \"what unhappy thoughts you have, to  be sure. This is proof that born brains cannot equal manufactured  brains, for my brains dwell only on facts and never borrow trouble.  When there is occasion for my brains to think, they think, but I would  be ashamed of my brains if they kept shooting out thoughts that were  merely fears and imaginings, such as do no good, but are likely to do  harm.\"    \"For my part,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"I do not think at all, but allow  my velvet heart to guide me at all times.\"    \"The tinsmith filled my hollow head with scraps and clippings of tin,\"  said the Soldier, \"and he told me they would do nicely for brains, but  when I begin to think, the tin scraps rattle around and get so mixed  that I'm soon bewildered. So I try not to think. My tin heart is almost  as useless to me, for it is hard and cold, so I'm sure the red velvet  heart of my friend Nick Chopper is a better guide.\"    \"Thoughtless people are not unusual,\" observed the Scarecrow, \"but I  consider them more fortunate than those who have useless or wicked  thoughts and do not try to curb them. Your oil can, friend Woodman, is  filled with oil, but you only apply the oil to your joints, drop by  drop, as you need it, and do not keep spilling it where it will do no  good. Thoughts should be restrained in the same way as your oil, and  only applied when necessary, and for a good purpose. If used carefully,  thoughts are good things to have.\"    Polychrome laughed at him, for the Rainbow's Daughter knew more about  thoughts than the Scarecrow did. But the others were solemn, feeling  they had been rebuked, and tramped on in silence.    Suddenly Woot, who was in the lead, looked around and found that all  his comrades had mysteriously disappeared. But where could they have  gone to? The broad plain was all about him and there were neither trees  nor bushes that could hide even a rabbit, nor any hole for one to fall  into. Yet there he stood, alone.    Surprise had caused him to halt, and with a thoughtful and puzzled  expression on his face he looked down at his feet. It startled him anew  to discover that he had no feet. He reached out his hands, but he could  not see them. He could feel his hands and arms and body; he stamped his  feet on the grass and knew they were there, but in some strange way  they had become invisible.    While Woot stood, wondering, a crash of metal sounded in his ears and  he heard two heavy bodies tumble to the earth just beside him.    \"Good gracious!\" exclaimed the voice of the Tin Woodman.    \"Mercy me!\" cried the voice of the Tin Soldier.    \"Why didn't you look where you were going?\" asked the Tin Woodman  reproachfully.    \"I did, but I couldn't see you,\" said the Tin Soldier. \"Something has  happened to my tin eyes. I can't see you, even now, nor can I see  anyone else!\"    \"It's the same way with me,\" admitted the Tin Woodman.    Woot couldn't see either of them, although he heard them plainly, and  just then something smashed against him unexpectedly and knocked him  over; but it was only the straw-stuffed body of the Scarecrow that fell  upon him and while he could not see the Scarecrow he managed to push  him off and rose to his feet just as Polychrome whirled against him and  made him tumble again.    Sitting upon the ground, the boy asked:    \"Can you see us, Poly?\"    \"No, indeed,\" answered the Rainbow's Daughter; \"we've all become  invisible.\"    \"How did it happen, do you suppose?\" inquired the Scarecrow, lying  where he had fallen.    \"We have met with no enemy,\" answered Poly-chrome, \"so it must be that  this part of the country has the magic quality of making people  invisible--even fairies falling under the charm. We can see the grass,  and the flowers, and the stretch of plain before us, and we can still  see Mount Munch in the distance; but we cannot see ourselves or one  another.\"    \"Well, what are we to do about it?\" demanded Woot.    \"I think this magic affects only a small part of the plain,\" replied  Polychrome; \"perhaps there is only a streak of the country where an  enchantment makes people become invisible. So, if we get together and  hold hands, we can travel toward Mount Munch until the enchanted streak  is passed.\"    \"All right,\" said Woot, jumping up, \"give me your hand, Polychrome.  Where are you?\"    \"Here,\" she answered. \"Whistle, Woot, and keep whistling until I come  to you.\"    So Woot whistled, and presently Polychrome found him and grasped his  hand.    \"Someone must help me up,\" said the Scarecrow, lying near them; so they  found the straw man and sat him upon his feet, after which he held fast  to Polychrome's other hand.    Nick Chopper and the Tin Soldier had managed to scramble up without  assistance, but it was awkward for them and the Tin Woodman said:    \"I don't seem to stand straight, somehow. But my joints all work, so I  guess I can walk.\"    Guided by his voice, they reached his side, where Woot grasped his tin  fingers so they might keep together.    The Tin Soldier was standing near by and the Scarecrow soon touched him  and took hold of his arm.    \"I hope you're not wobbly,\" said the straw man, \"for if two of us walk  unsteadily we will be sure to fall.\"    \"I'm not wobbly,\" the Tin Soldier assured him, \"but I'm certain that  one of my legs is shorter than the other. I can't see it, to tell  what's gone wrong, but I'll limp on with the rest of you until we are  out of this enchanted territory.\"    They now formed a line, holding hands, and turning their faces toward  Mount Munch resumed their journey. They had not gone far, however, when  a terrible growl saluted their ears. The sound seemed to come from a  place just in front of them, so they halted abruptly and remained  silent, listening with all their ears.    \"I smell straw!\" cried a hoarse, harsh voice, with more growls and  snarls. \"I smell straw, and I'm a Hip-po-gy-raf who loves straw and  eats all he can find. I want to eat this straw! Where is it? Where is  it?\"    The Scarecrow, hearing this, trembled but kept silent. All the others  were silent, too, hoping that the invisible beast would be unable to  find them. But the creature sniffed the odor of the straw and drew  nearer and nearer to them until he reached the Tin Woodman, on one end  of the line. It was a big beast and it smelled of the Tin Woodman and  grated two rows of enormous teeth against the Emperor's tin body.    \"Bah! that's not straw,\" said the harsh voice, and the beast advanced  along the line to Woot.    \"Meat! Pooh, you're no good! I can't eat meat,\" grumbled the beast, and  passed on to Polychrome.    \"Sweetmeats and perfume--cobw"]]]
