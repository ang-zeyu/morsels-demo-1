They also admired his riding gloves which, a strange affectation in a  country of buckskin, were always the softest and the smoothest and the  most comfortable kid that could be obtained.    Truth to tell, he did not handle a rope. He could not tell the noose  end of a lariat from the straight end, hardly. Neither did Ronicky  Doone know the slightest thing about barbed wire, except how to cut  it when he wished to ride through. Let us look closely at the hands  themselves, as Ronicky stands in the door of the hotel and stares at  the people walking by. For he has taken off his gloves and he now  rolls a cigarette.    They are very long hands. The fingers are extremely slender and  tapering. The wrists are round and almost as innocent of sinews as the  wrists of a woman, save when he grips something, and then how they  stand out. But, most remarkable of all, the skin of the palms of those  hands is amazingly soft. It is truly as soft as the skin of the hand  of a girl.    There were some who shook their heads when they saw those hands. There  were some who inferred that Ronicky Doone was little better than a  scapegrace, and that, in reality, he had never done a better or more  useful thing than handle cards and swing a revolver. In both of which  arts it was admitted that he was incredibly dexterous. As a matter  of fact, since there was no estate from which he drew an income, and  since he had never been known in the entire history of his young life  to do a single stroke of productive work of any kind, the bitter  truth was that Ronicky Doone was no better and no worse than a common  gambler.    Indeed, if to play a game of chance is to commit a sin, Ronicky Doone  was a very great sinner. Yet it should be remarked that he lacked the  fine art of taking the money of other less clever fellows when they  were intoxicated, and he also lacked the fine hardness of mind which  enables many gamblers to enjoy taking the last cent from an opponent.  Also, though he knew the entire list of tricks in the repertoire of  a crooked gambler, he had never been known to employ tricking.  He trusted in a calm head, a quick judgment, an ability to read  character. And, though he occasionally met with crooked professionals  who were wolves in the guise of sheep, no one had ever been known to  play more than one crooked trick at cards when playing against Ronicky  Doone. So, on the whole, he made a very good living.    What he had he gave or threw away in wild spending or loaned to  friends, of whom he had a vast number. All of which goes to explain  the soft hands of Ronicky Doone and his nervous, swift-moving fingers,  as he stood at the door of the hotel. For he who plays long with cards  or dice begins to have a special sense developed in the tips of his  fingers, so that they seem to be independent intelligences.    He crossed his feet. His boots were the finest leather, bench-made by  the best of bootmakers, and they fitted the high-arched instep with  the elastic smoothness of gloves. The man of the mountain desert  dresses the extremities and cares not at all for the mid sections.  The moment Doone was off his horse those boots had to be dressed and  rubbed and polished to softness and brightness before this luxurious  gambler would walk about town. From the heels of the boots extended a  long pair of spurs--surely a very great vanity, for never in her life  had his beautiful mare, Lou, needed even the touch of a spur.    But Ronicky Doone could not give up this touch of luxury. The spurs  were plated heavily with gold, and they swept up and out in a long,  exquisite curve, the hub of the rowel set with diamonds.    In a word Ronicky Doone was a dandy, but he had this peculiarity,  that he seemed to dress to please himself rather than the rest of the  world. His glances never roved about taking account of the admiration  of others. As he leaned there in the door of the hotel he was the type  of the young, happy, genuine and carefree fellow, whose mind is no  heavier with a thousand dollars or a thousand cents in his pocket.    Suddenly he started from his lounging place, caught his hat more  firmly over his eyes, threw away his unlighted cigarette and hurried  across the veranda of the hotel. Had he seen an enemy to chastise,  or an old friend to greet, or a pretty girl? No, it was only old Jud  Harding, the blacksmith, whose hand had lost its strength, but who  still worked iron as others mold putty, simply because he had the  genius for his craft. He was staggering now under a load of boards  which he had shouldered to carry to his shop. In a moment that load  was shifted to the shoulder of Ronicky Doone, and they went on down  the street, laughing and talking together until the load was dropped  on the floor of Harding's shop.    \"And how's the sick feller coming?\" asked Harding.    \"Coming fine,\" answered Ronicky. \"Couple of days and I'll have him out  for a little exercise. Lucky thing it was a clean wound and didn't  nick the bone. Soon as it's healed over he'll never know he was  plugged.\"    Harding considered his young friend with twinkling eyes. \"Queer thing  to me,\" he said, \"is how you and this gent Gregg have hit it off so  well together. Might almost say it was like you'd shot Gregg and now  was trying to make up for it. But, of course, that ain't the truth.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Ronicky gravely and met the eye of Harding  without faltering.    \"Another queer thing,\" went on the cunning old smith. \"He was fooling  with that gun while he was in the saddle, which just means that the  muzzle must of been pretty close to his skin. But there wasn't any  sign of a powder burn, the doc says.\"    \"But his trousers was pretty bad burned, I guess,\" said Ronicky.    \"H-m,\" said the blacksmith, \"that's the first time I've heard about  it.\" He went on more seriously: \"I got something to tell you, Ronicky.  Ever hear the story about the gent that took pity on the snake that  was stiff with cold and brought the snake in to warm him up beside the  fire? The minute the snake come to life he sunk his fangs in the gent  that had saved him.\"    \"Meaning,\" said Ronicky, \"that, because I've done a good turn for  Gregg, I'd better look out for him?\"    \"Meaning nothing,\" said Harding, \"except that the reason the snake bit  the gent was because he'd had a stone heaved at him by the same man  one day and hadn't forgot it.\"    But Ronicky Doone merely laughed and turned back toward the hotel.          Chapter Four      _His Victim's Trouble_    Yet he could not help pondering on the words of old Harding. Bill  Gregg had been a strange patient. He had never repeated his first  offer to tell his story. He remained sullen and silent, with his  brooding eyes fixed on the blank wall before him, and nothing could  permanently cheer him. Some inward gloom seemed to possess the man.    The first day after the shooting he had insisted on scrawling a  painfully written letter, while Ronicky propped a writing board in  front of him, as he lay flat on his back in the bed, but that was his  only act. Thereafter he remained silent and brooding. Perhaps it  was hatred for Ronicky that was growing in him, as the sense of  disappointment increased, for Ronicky, after all, had kept him from  reaching that girl when the train passed through Stillwater. Perhaps,  for all Ronicky knew, his bullet had ruined the happiness of two  lives. He shrugged that disagreeable thought away, and, reaching the  hotel, he went straight up to the room of the sick man.    \"Bill,\" he said gently, \"have you been spending all your time hating  me? Is that what keeps you thin and glum? Is it because you sit here  all day blaming me for all the things that have happened to you?\"    The dark flush and the uneasy flicker of Gregg's glance gave a  sufficient answer. Ronicky Doone sighed and shook his head, but not in  anger.    \"You don't have to talk,\" he said. \"I see that I'm right. And I don't  blame you, Bill, because, maybe, I've spoiled things pretty generally  for you.\"    At first the silence of Bill Gregg admitted that he felt the same way  about the matter, yet he finally said aloud: \"I don't blame you. Maybe  you thought I was a hoss thief. But the thing is done, Ronicky, and it  won't never be undone!\"    \"Gregg,\" said Ronicky, \"d'you know what you're going to do now?\"    \"I dunno.\"    \"You're going to sit there and roll a cigarette and tell me the whole  yarn. You ain't through with this little chase. Not if I have to drag  you along with me. But first just figure that I'm your older brother  or something like that and get rid of the whole yarn. Got to have the  ore specimens before you can assay 'em. Besides, it'll help you a pile  to get the poison out of your system. If you feel like cussing me  hearty when the time comes go ahead and cuss, but I got to hear that  story.\"    \"Maybe it would help,\" said Gregg, \"but it's a fool story to tell.\"    \"Leave that to me to say whether it's a fool story or not. You start  the talking.\"    Gregg shifted himself to a more comfortable position, as is the  immemorial custom of story tellers, and his glance misted a little  with the flood of recollections.    \"Started along back about a year ago,\" he said. \"I was up to the  Sullivan Mountains working a claim. There wasn't much to it, just  enough to keep me going sort of comfortable. I pegged away at it  pretty steady, leading a lonely life and hoping every day that I'd cut  my way down to a good lead. Well, the fine ore never showed up.    \"Meantime I got pretty weary of them same mountains, staring me in the  face all the time. I didn't have even a dog with me for conversation,  so I got to thinking. Thinking is a bad thing, mostly, don't you  agree,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11887"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

About six o'clock, the late sheriffs, having left the  Lord Mayor at his house, attended us to Guildhall, where we were  met by our own and the former under-sheriffs, together with the  secondaries and keepers of the prisons; and the names of the  respective prisoners in each gaol being read over, the keepers  acknowledged them one by one, to be in their custody; and then  tendered us the keys, which we delivered back to them again, and after  having executed the indentures, whereby we covenanted and undertook  the charge of our office, we were invited according to custom, to an  adjoining tavern; and there partook of an entertainment of sack and  walnuts, provided by the aforesaid keepers of the prisons.    \"Monday, September 29th. This being Michaelmas-day, my brother sheriff  and I set out for the first time in our new equipages and scarlet  gowns, attended by our beadles, and the several officers of our  Counters, and waited on the Lord Mayor, at Merchant Taylors' Hall, at  which he kept his mayoralty, and proceeded with him from thence, as  is customary, to Guildhall, where the livery-men of the city were  summoned to attend at the Court of Hustings for the election of a new  lord mayor for the year ensuing. The recorder made a speech to the  livery-men, 'apprising them of the custom and manner of choosing a  lord mayor; which, he observed, was for the Common Hall to nominate  two of the aldermen who had served sheriffs, to the Court of Aldermen,  who had then a right to elect either of them into that great office,  and which ever that the court so fixed on, the Common Hall was bound  to accept.' When he had ended, the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen  retired into the Council Chamber, and left us to preside at the  election, attended by the Common Sergeant and other officers. The  method of voting is, by each alderman going up to the recorder and  town clerk, who sit at a separate part of the room, and telling the  person he would choose, a scratch is made under each respective name.\"    On the day following, the two sheriffs again went to Guildhall, with  the same company as on the preceding day, and waiting on the Lord  Mayor in the Council Chamber, requested that his lordship and the  recorder would present them at his Majesty's Court of Exchequer. Each  sheriff then paid the usual fees, viz. _6l. 13s. 4d._ to the Lord  Mayor, and _3l. 6s. 8d._ to the recorder; after which, they proceeded  to the Three Cranes' Stairs, in Upper Thames Street, \"the Lord Mayor  first; we, the sheriffs, next; the recorder and aldermen following in  coaches, the companies walking before us.    \"From thence we went to Westminster in the city barge, taking place  of all the aldermen: and our two companies attended in the Goldsmiths'  barge, as before agreed on, adorned with half the colours, and rowed  with half the watermen belonging to the Drapers' company. On landing,  the companies went first, the Lord Mayor next, then the recorder with  a sheriff on each side, and last the aldermen. On our approaching the  bar of the Exchequer [in Westminster Hall,] the recorder, in a speech,  presented us to the Court, one of the Barons being seated there for  that purpose, signifying the choice the citizens had made, and that,  in pursuance of our charter, we were presented to his Majesty's  justices for his royal approbation; and the Baron accordingly  approving the choice, he, and the Clerks of the Exchequer, were  invited to our dinner; then the late sheriffs were sworn to their  accounts, and made their proffers; and the senior alderman present  cut one twig in two, and bent another, and the officers of the court  counted six horse-shoes and hob-nails.    \"This formality, it is said, is passed through each year, by way  of suit and service for the citizens holding some tenements in St.  Clement's Danes, as also some other lands; but where they are situated  no one knows, nor doth the city receive any rents or profits thereby.    \"This done, we returned in the same order to the Three Cranes, and  from thence, in our coaches, to dinner at Drapers' Hall; where my Lord  Mayor, aldermen, gentlemen of Guildhall, and guests invited, dined  at one table, and we, the sheriff's, at the head of another, with the  Court of Assistance of each of our companies: and the Clerks of the  Exchequer by themselves at another table. After dinner, the Lord  Mayor, aldermen, &c. returned into a separate room, where we sat with  them at the head of the table, one on each side of the Lord Mayor;  our two companies were in another room, and the greatest part of the  Clerks of the Exchequer remained in the hall.\"    On the 7th of October they \"settled a point,\" with the keeper of  Newgate in regard to the transportation of _felons_. That was, that  the keeper should deliver them to the merchant, \"who contracts to  carry them over,\" at the door of Newgate, and there discharge himself  of any further custody; but leaving him and his officers the privilege  of protecting them down to the water side, according to any private  agreement between him and the merchant; it being fully understood that  the sheriffs should not be responsible for their charge \"from the time  of their first delivery.\"    (_TO BE CONCLUDED IN OUR NEXT._)           *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.      STEAM CARRIAGES ON COMMON ROADS.          (_From Mr. Alexander Gordon's Treatise on Elemental      Locomotion. Concluded from page 185._)    We do not advocate any thing so preposterous as the change of the  whole animate power of Great Britain into inanimate, though in this  the political economist can see the solution of all our Malthusian  difficulties to an indefinite extent and duration. What we urge is  merely the partial adoption of the thing to such an extent as will  relax the present pressure, and restore us to a wholesome state of  national prosperity. This will occasion no dangerous experiment, and  will be gradually followed up by a progressive conversion, by which  all the conflicting interests of society will be neutralized, and  the aggregate wealth, and prosperity, and happiness of the empire be  equalized.    If then _elemental locomotion_ can he made to substitute the  expensive, unproductive system of animate labour now in use, it will  indubitably be for the vital interest of all classes of society that  the substitution should be realized speedily and extensively. That  steam can be so applied has been _satisfactorily proved_. The report  of the Committee of the House of Commons establishes this. But the  evidence of several of the enlightened and practical witnesses who  were examined before that committee bears with too much emphasis upon  the detail of the commercial and economic advantages of the project  we have just been attempting to enumerate and advocate, for us not to  avail ourselves of it even at this early stage of our work. It being  quite decisive in support of the grand conclusion to which the  said committee came after three months of patient and thorough  investigation of the subject, viz. \"_That the substitution of  inanimate for animate power is one of the most important improvements  in the means of internal communication ever introduced._\"        [Then follow extracts from the evidence of Messrs. Torrens,      John Farey, Davies Gilbert, and Goldsworthy Garney.]    In viewing the moral advantages which must result from  steam-carriages, we find them of no less importance. There are but few  so constitutionally indifferent to acceleration in travelling as  the Hollander, who delighted in the \"old, solemn, straight-forward,  regular Dutch canal speed--three miles an hour for expresses, and two  for joy or trot journeys.\" Acceleration in the speed of travelling, if  unaccompanied by danger, is eagerly sought after, because the period  of discomfort is lessened. But steam-carriages will not only lessen  the discomfort by shortening its duration; they can be so equipped  that positive comfort, nay, luxury, may be enjoyed. A steam-engine is  perfectly under control, and consequently much more safe than horses.  The life of the traveller cannot be jeoparded by the breaking of a  rein, horses being frightened, running off, &c. &c.; the steamer,  it will be seen, the honourable Committee report to the House \"is  perfectly safe for passengers.\"    The actual casualties of stage-coaches, however, we may observe, bear  no proportion to the loss of lives from consumption and other diseases  occasioned by cold and wet, from exposure on the top of coaches.[4]        [4] It appears from the newspapers that on the night of the      25th of February, 1812, three outside passengers were found      dead on the roof of the Bath coach, from the inclemency of the      weather.    Let us consider also how far humanity is outraged by the present  system of quick travelling. The short average life of stage-coach  horses (three years only!) shows how dreadfully over-wrought and  _out-wrought_ they are by the great speed now in practice. Driven for  eight or ten miles, with an oppressive weight, they tremble in every  nerve. With nostrils distended, and sides moving in breathless agony,  they can scarce,"]]]
