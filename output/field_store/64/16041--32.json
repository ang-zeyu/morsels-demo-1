She seized the pearl necklace, to which was attached the great  locket, and jerked it with all her strength.    The result was encouraging. Quox stopped snoring and his eyelids  flickered. So Polychrome jerked again--and again--till slowly the great  lids raised and the dragon looked at her steadily. Said he, in a sleepy  tone:    \"What's the matter, little Rainbow?\"    \"Come quick!\" exclaimed Polychrome. \"Ruggedo has captured all our  friends and is about to destroy them.\"    \"Well, well,\" said Quox, \"I suspected that would happen. Step a little  out of my path, my dear, and I'll make a rush for the Nome King's  cavern.\"    She fell back a few steps and Quox raised himself on his stout legs,  whisked his long tail and in an instant had slid down the rocks and  made a dive through the entrance.    Along the passage he swept, nearly filling it with his immense body,  and now he poked his head into the jeweled cavern of Ruggedo.    But the King had long since made arrangements to capture the dragon,  whenever he might appear. No sooner did Quox stick his head into the  room than a thick chain fell from above and encircled his neck. Then  the ends of the chain were drawn tight--for in an adjoining cavern a  thousand nomes were pulling on them--and so the dragon could advance no  further toward the King. He could not use his teeth or his claws and as  his body was still in the passage he had not even room to strike his  foes with his terrible tail.    Ruggedo was delighted with the success of his stratagem. He had just  transformed the Rose Princess into a fiddle and was about to transform  Files into a fiddle bow, when the dragon appeared to interrupt him. So  he called out:    \"Welcome, my dear Quox, to my royal entertainment. Since you are here,  you shall witness some very neat magic, and after I have finished with  Files and Tik-Tok I mean to transform you into a tiny lizard--one of  the chameleon sort--and you shall live in my cavern and amuse me.\"    \"Pardon me for contradicting Your Majesty,\" returned Quox in a quiet  voice, \"but I don't believe you'll perform any more magic.\"    \"Eh? Why not?\" asked the King in surprise.    \"There's a reason,\" said Quox. \"Do you see this ribbon around my neck?\"    \"Yes; and I'm astonished that a dignified dragon should wear such a  silly thing.\"    \"Do you see it plainly?\" persisted the dragon, with a little chuckle of  amusement.    \"I do,\" declared Ruggedo.    \"Then you no longer possess any magical powers, and are as helpless as  a clam,\" asserted Quox. \"My great master, Tititi-Hoochoo, the Jinjin,  enchanted this ribbon in such a way that whenever Your Majesty looked  upon it all knowledge of magic would desert you instantly, nor will any  magical formula you can remember ever perform your bidding.\"    \"Pooh! I don't believe a word of it!\" cried Ruggedo, half frightened,  nevertheless. Then he turned toward Files and tried to transform him  into a fiddle bow. But he could not remember the right words or the  right pass of the hands and after several trials he finally gave up the  attempt.    By this time the Nome King was so alarmed that he was secretly shaking  in his shoes.    \"I told you not to anger Tititi-Hoochoo,\" grumbled Kaliko, \"and now you  see the result of your disobedience.\"    Ruggedo promptly threw his sceptre at his Royal Chamberlain, who dodged  it with his usual cleverness, and then he said with an attempt to  swagger:    \"Never mind; I don't need magic to enable me to destroy these invaders;  fire and the sword will do the business and I am still King of the  Nomes and lord and master of my Underground Kingdom!\"    \"Again I beg to differ with Your Majesty,\" said Quox. \"The Great Jinjin  commands you to depart instantly from this Kingdom and seek the earth's  surface, where you will wander for all time to come, without a home or  country, without a friend or follower, and without any more riches than  you can carry with you in your pockets. The Great Jinjin is so generous  that he will allow you to fill your pockets with jewels or gold, but  you must take nothing more.\"    Ruggedo now stared at the dragon in amazement.    \"Does Tititi-Hoochoo condemn me to such a fate?\" he asked in a hoarse  voice.    \"He does,\" said Quox.    \"And just for throwing a few strangers down the Forbidden Tube?\"    \"Just for that,\" repeated Quox in a stern, gruff voice.    \"Well, I won't do it. And your crazy old Jinjin can't make me do it,  either!\" declared Ruggedo. \"I intend to remain here, King of the Nomes,  until the end of the world, and I defy your Tititi-Hoochoo and all his  fairies--as well as his clumsy messenger, whom I have been obliged to  chain up!\"    The dragon smiled again, but it was not the sort of smile that made  Ruggedo feel very happy. Instead, there was something so cold and  merciless in the dragon's expression that the condemned Nome King  trembled and was sick at heart.    There was little comfort for Ruggedo in the fact that the dragon was  now chained, although he had boasted of it. He glared at the immense  head of Quox as if fascinated and there was fear in the old King's eyes  as he watched his enemy's movements.    For the dragon was now moving; not abruptly, but as if he had something  to do and was about to do it. Very deliberately he raised one claw,  touched the catch of the great jeweled locket that was suspended around  his neck, and at once it opened wide.    Nothing much happened at first; half a dozen hen's eggs rolled out upon  the floor and then the locket closed with a sharp click. But the effect  upon the nomes of this simple thing was astounding. General Guph,  Kaliko, Pang and his band of executioners were all standing close to  the door that led to the vast series of underground caverns which  constituted the dominions of the nomes, and as soon as they saw the  eggs they raised a chorus of frantic screams and rushed through the  door, slamming it in Ruggedo's face and placing a heavy bronze bar  across it.    Ruggedo, dancing with terror and uttering loud cries, now leaped upon  the seat of his throne to escape the eggs, which had rolled steadily  toward him. Perhaps these eggs, sent by the wise and crafty  Tititi-Hoochoo, were in some way enchanted, for they all rolled  directly after Ruggedo and when they reached the throne where he had  taken refuge they began rolling up the legs to the seat.    This was too much for the King to bear. His horror of eggs was real and  absolute and he made a leap from the throne to the center of the room  and then ran to a far corner.    The eggs followed, rolling slowly but steadily in his direction.  Ruggedo threw his sceptre at them, and then his ruby crown, and then he  drew off his heavy golden sandals and hurled these at the advancing  eggs. But the eggs dodged every missile and continued to draw nearer.  The King stood trembling, his eyes staring in terror, until they were  but half a yard distant; then with an agile leap he jumped clear over  them and made a rush for the passage that led to the outer entrance.    Of course the dragon was in his way, being chained in the passage with  his head in the cavern, but when he saw the King making toward him he  crouched as low as he could and dropped his chin to the floor, leaving  a small space between his body and the roof of the passage.    Ruggedo did not hesitate an instant. Impelled by fear, he leaped to the  dragon's nose and then scrambled to his back, where he succeeded in  squeezing himself through the opening. After the head was passed there  was more room and he slid along the dragon's scales to his tail and  then ran as fast as his legs would carry him to the entrance. Not  pausing here, so great was his fright, the King dashed on down the  mountain path, but before he had gone very far he stumbled and fell.    When he picked himself up he observed that no one was following him,  and while he recovered his breath he happened to think of the decree of  the Jinjin--that he should be driven from his Kingdom and made a  wanderer on the face of the earth. Well, here he was, driven from his  cavern in truth; driven by those dreadful eggs; but he would go back  and defy them; he would not submit to losing his precious Kingdom and  his tyrannical powers, all because Tititi-Hoochoo had said he must.    So, although still afraid, Ruggedo nerved himself to creep back along  the path to the entrance, and when he arrived there he saw the six eggs  lying in a row just before the arched opening.    At first he paused a safe distance away to consider the case, for the  eggs were now motionless. While he was wondering what could be done, he  remembered there was a magical charm which would destroy eggs and  render them harmless to nomes. There were nine passes to be made and  six verses of incantation to be recited; but Ruggedo knew them all. Now  that he had ample time to be exact, he carefully went through the  entire ceremony.    But nothing happened. The eggs did not disappear, as he had expected;  so he repeated the charm a second time. When that also failed, he  remembered, with a moan of despair, that his magic power had been taken  away from him and in the future he could do no more than any common  mortal.    And there were the eggs, forever barring him from the Kingdom which he  had ruled so long with absolute sway! He threw rocks at them, but could  not hit a single egg. He raved and scolded and tore his hair and beard,  and danced in helpless passion, but that did nothing to avert the just  judgment of the Jinjin, which Ruggedo's own evil deeds had brought upon  him.    From this time on he was an outcast--a wanderer upon the face of the  earth--and he had even forgotten to fill his pockets with gold and  jewels before he fled from his former Kingdom!          Chapter Nineteen    King Kaliko      After the King had made good his escape Files said to the dragon, in a  sad voice:    \"Alas!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#20)"],[1,"again until the excitement  was over.\"    \"Can you find your way back home again?\" asked the boy.    \"Yes, easily; for now I know exactly where it is. But where are Trot  and Cap'n Bill?\"    Button-Bright related to the Ork their adventures since it had left  them in Jinxland, telling of Trot's fear that the King had done  something wicked to Cap'n Bill, and of Pon's love for Gloria, and how  Trot and Button-Bright had been turned out of the King's castle. That  was all the news that the boy had, but it made the Ork anxious for the  safety of his friends.    \"We must go to them at once, for they may need us,\" he said.    \"I don't know where to go,\" confessed Button-Bright. \"I'm lost.\"    \"Well, I can take you back to the hut of the gardener's boy,\" promised  the Ork, \"for when I fly high in the air I can look down and easily spy  the King's castle. That was how I happened to spy you, just entering  the grove; so I flew down and waited until you came out.\"    \"How can you carry me?\" asked the boy.    \"You'll have to sit straddle my shoulders and put your arms around my  neck. Do you think you can keep from falling off?\"    \"I'll try,\" said Button-Bright. So the Ork squatted down and the boy  took his seat and held on tight. Then the skinny creature's tail began  whirling and up they went, far above all the tree-tops.    After the Ork had circled around once or twice, its sharp eyes located  the towers of the castle and away it flew, straight toward the place.  As it hovered in the air, near by the castle, Button-Bright pointed out  Pon's hut, so they landed just before it and Trot came running out to  greet them.    Gloria was introduced to the Ork, who was surprised to find Cap'n Bill  transformed into a grasshopper.    \"How do you like it?\" asked the creature.    \"Why, it worries me good deal,\" answered Cap'n Bill, perched upon  Trot's shoulder. \"I'm always afraid o' bein' stepped on, and I don't  like the flavor of grass an' can't seem to get used to it. It's my  nature to eat grass, you know, but I begin to suspect it's an acquired  taste.\"    \"Can you give molasses?\" asked the Ork.    \"I guess I'm not that kind of a grasshopper,\" replied Cap'n Bill. \"But  I can't say what I might do if I was squeezed--which I hope I won't be.\"    \"Well,\" said the Ork, \"it's a great pity, and I'd like to meet that  cruel King and his Wicked Witch and punish them both severely. You're  awfully small, Cap'n Bill, but I think I would recognize you anywhere  by your wooden leg.\"    Then the Ork and Button-Bright were told all about Gloria's frozen  heart and how the Scarecrow had come from the Land of Oz to help them.  The Ork seemed rather disturbed when it learned that the Scarecrow had  gone alone to conquer King Krewl.    \"I'm afraid he'll make a fizzle of it,\" said the skinny creature, \"and  there's no telling what that terrible King might do to the poor  Scarecrow, who seems like a very interesting person. So I believe I'll  take a hand in this conquest myself.\"    \"How?\" asked Trot.    \"Wait and see,\" was the reply. \"But, first of all, I must fly home  again--back to my own country--so if you'll forgive my leaving you so  soon, I'll be off at once. Stand away from my tail, please, so that the  wind from it, when it revolves, won't knock you over.\"    They gave the creature plenty of room and away it went like a flash and  soon disappeared in the sky.    \"I wonder,\" said Button-Bright, looking solemnly after the Ork,  \"whether he'll ever come back again.\"    \"Of course he will!\" returned Trot. \"The Ork's a pretty good fellow,  and we can depend on him. An' mark my words, Button-Bright, whenever  our Ork does come back, there's one cruel King in Jinxland that'll wish  he hadn't.\"          Chapter Eighteen    The Scarecrow Meets an Enemy      The Scarecrow was not a bit afraid of King Krewl. Indeed, he rather  enjoyed the prospect of conquering the evil King and putting Gloria on  the throne of Jinxland in his place. So he advanced boldly to the royal  castle and demanded admittance.    Seeing that he was a stranger, the soldiers allowed him to enter. He  made his way straight to the throne room, where at that time his  Majesty was settling the disputes among his subjects.    \"Who are you?\" demanded the King.    \"I'm the Scarecrow of Oz, and I command you to surrender yourself my  prisoner.\"    \"Why should I do that?\" inquired the King, much astonished at the straw  man's audacity.    \"Because I've decided you are too cruel a King to rule so beautiful a  country. You must remember that Jinxland is a part of Oz, and therefore  you owe allegiance to Ozma of Oz, whose friend and servant I am.\"    Now, when he heard this, King Krewl was much disturbed in mind, for he  knew the Scarecrow spoke the truth. But no one had ever before come to  Jinxland from the Land of Oz and the King did not intend to be put out  of his throne if he could help it. Therefore he gave a harsh, wicked  laugh of derision and said:    \"I'm busy, now. Stand out of my way, Scarecrow, and I'll talk with you  by and by.\"    But the Scarecrow turned to the assembled courtiers and people and  called in a loud voice:    \"I hereby declare, in the name of Ozma of Oz, that this man is no  longer ruler of Jinxland. From this moment Princess Gloria is your  rightful Queen, and I ask all of you to be loyal to her and to obey her  commands.\"    The people looked fearfully at the King, whom they all hated in their  hearts, but likewise feared. Krewl was now in a terrible rage and he  raised his golden sceptre and struck the Scarecrow so heavy a blow that  he fell to the floor.    But he was up again, in an instant, and with Pon's riding-whip he  switched the King so hard that the wicked monarch roared with pain as  much as with rage, calling on his soldiers to capture the Scarecrow.    They tried to do that, and thrust their lances and swords into the  straw body, but without doing any damage except to make holes in the  Scarecrow's clothes. However, they were many against one and finally  old Googly-Goo brought a rope which he wound around the Scarecrow,  binding his legs together and his arms to his sides, and after that the  fight was over.    The King stormed and danced around in a dreadful fury, for he had never  been so switched since he was a boy--and perhaps not then. He ordered  the Scarecrow thrust into the castle prison, which was no task at all  because one man could carry him easily, bound as he was.    Even after the prisoner was removed the King could not control his  anger. He tried to figure out some way to be revenged upon the straw  man, but could think of nothing that could hurt him. At last, when the  terrified people and the frightened courtiers had all slunk away, old  Googly-Goo approached the king with a malicious grin upon his face.    \"I'll tell you what to do,\" said he. \"Build a big bonfire and burn the  Scarecrow up, and that will be the end of him.\"    The King was so delighted with this suggestion that he hugged old  Googly-Goo in his joy.    \"Of course!\" he cried. \"The very thing. Why did I not think of it  myself?\"    So he summoned his soldiers and retainers and bade them prepare a great  bonfire in an open space in the castle park. Also he sent word to all  his people to assemble and witness the destruction of the Scarecrow who  had dared to defy his power. Before long a vast throng gathered in the  park and the servants had heaped up enough fuel to make a fire that  might be seen for miles away--even in the daytime.    When all was prepared, the King had his throne brought out for him to  sit upon and enjoy the spectacle, and then he sent his soldiers to  fetch the Scarecrow.    Now the one thing in all the world that the straw man really feared was  fire. He knew he would burn very easily and that his ashes wouldn't  amount to much afterward. It wouldn't hurt him to be destroyed in such  a manner, but he realized that many people in the Land of Oz, and  especially Dorothy and the Royal Ozma, would feel sad if they learned  that their old friend the Scarecrow was no longer in existence.    In spite of this, the straw man was brave and faced his fiery fate like  a hero. When they marched him out before the concourse of people he  turned to the King with great calmness and said:    \"This wicked deed will cost you your throne, as well as much suffering,  for my friends will avenge my destruction.\"    \"Your friends are not here, nor will they know what I have done to you,  when you are gone and can-not tell them,\" answered the King in a  scornful voice.    Then he ordered the Scarecrow bound to a stout stake that he had had  driven into the ground, and the materials for the fire were heaped all  around him. When this had been done, the King's brass band struck up a  lively tune and old Googly-Goo came forward with a lighted match and  set fire to the pile.    At once the flames shot up and crept closer and closer toward the  Scarecrow. The King and all his people were so intent upon this  terrible spectacle that none of them noticed how the sky grew suddenly  dark. Perhaps they thought that the loud buzzing sound--like the noise  of a dozen moving railway trains--came from the blazing fagots; that  the rush of wind was merely a breeze. But suddenly down swept a flock  of Orks, half a hundred of them at the least, and the powerful currents  of air caused by their revolving tails sent the bonfire scattering in  every direction, so that not one burning brand ever touched the  Scarecrow.    But that was not the only effect of this sudden tornado. King Krewl was  blown out of his throne and went tumbling heels over head until he  landed with a bump against the stone wall of his own castle, and before  he could rise a big Ork sat upon him and held him pressed flat to the  ground. Old Googly-Goo shot up into the air like a rocket and landed on  a tree, where he hung by the middle on a high limb, kicking the air  with his feet and"]]]
