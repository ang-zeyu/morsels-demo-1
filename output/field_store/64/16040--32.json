[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#20)"],[1,"you get Tom back?\" asked Mrs. Baggert anxiously.    \"Of course!\" declared Ned, though it must be admitted he spoke with  more confidence than he really felt. \"We'll begin the search right  away.\"    \"And if I can get my hands on any of those villains--\" spluttered Mr.  Damon, dancing around, as Mrs. Baggert said, \"like a hen on a hot  griddle,\" which seemed to describe him very well, \"if I can get hold of  any of those scoundrels, I'll--I'll--Bless my collar button, I don't  know what I will do! Come on, Ned!\"    \"Yes, I guess we'd better get busy,\" agreed the young bank clerk. \"Tom  has gone somewhere, that's certain, and under a misapprehension. It may  be that we are needlessly alarmed, or they may mean bad business. At  any rate, it's up to us to find Tom.\"    In Ned's runabout, which was a speedier car than that of the eccentric  man, the two set off for Kanker's farm. On the way they stopped at  various places in town, where Tom was in the habit of doing business,  to inquire if he had been seen.    But there was no trace of him. The next thing to do was to learn if he  had really started for the Kanker farm.    \"For if he didn't go there,\" suggested Ned, \"it will look funny for us  to go out there making inquiries about him. And it may be that after he  got that message Tom decided not to go.\"    Accordingly they made enough inquiries to establish the fact that Tom  had started for the farm of the rascally Kanker, who had been so  insistent in the matter of his almost worthless barn.    A number of people who knew Tom well had seen him pass in the direction  of Kanker's place, and some had spoken to him, for the young inventor  was well known in the vicinity of Shopton and the neighboring towns.    \"Well, out to Kanker's we'll go!\" decided Ned. \"And if anything has  happened to Tom there--well, we'll make whoever is responsible wish it  hadn't!\"    \"Bless my fountain pen, but that's what we will!\" chimed in Mr. Damon.    And so the two began the search for the missing youth.          Chapter XXI    A Prisoner      Amos Kanker came to the door of his farmhouse as Ned and Mr. Damon  drove up in the runabout. There was an unpleasant grin on the not very  prepossessing face of the farmer, and what Ned thought was a cunning  look, as he slouched out and asked:    \"Well, what do you want? Come to smash up any more of my barns at three  thousand dollars a smash?\"    \"Hardly,\" answered Ned shortly. \"Your prices are too high for such  ramshackle barns as you have. Where's Tom Swift?\" he asked sharply.    \"Huh! Do you mean that young whipper-snapper with his big traction  engine?\" demanded Mr. Kanker.    \"Look here!\" blustered Mr. Damon, \"Tom Swift is neither a  whipper-snapper nor is his machine a traction engine. It's a war tank.\"    \"That doesn't matter much to me,\" said the farmer, with a grating  laugh. \"It looks like a traction engine, though it smashes things up  more'n any one I ever saw.\"    \"That isn't the point,\" broke in Ned. \"Where is my friend, Tom Swift?  That's what we want to know.\"    \"Huh! What makes you think I can tell you?\" demanded Kanker.    \"Didn't he come out here?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Not as I knows of,\" was the surly answer.    \"Look here!\" exclaimed Ned, and his tones were firm, with no bluster  nor bluff in them, \"we came out here to find Tom Swift, and we're going  to find him! We have reason to believe he's here--at least, he started  for here,\" he substituted, as he wished to make no statement he could  not prove. \"Now we don't claim we have any right to be on your  property, and we don't intend to stay here any longer than we can help.  But we do claim the right, in common decency, to ask if you have seen  anything of Tom. There may have been an accident; there may have been  foul play; and there may be international complications in this  business. If there are, those involved won't get off as easily as they  think.  I'd advise you to keep a civil tongue in your head and answer  our questions. If we have to get the police and detectives out here, as  well as the governmental department of justice, you may have to answer  their questions, and they won't be as decent to you as we are!\"    \"Hurray!\" whispered Mr Damon to Ned. \"That's the way to talk!\"    And indeed the forceful remarks of the young bank clerk did appear to  have a salutary effect on the surly farmer.  His manner changed at once  and his grin faded.    \"I don't know nothing about Tom Swift or any of your friends,\" he said.  \"I've got my farm work to do, and I do it. It's hard enough to earn a  living these war times without taking part in plots. I haven't seen Tom  Swift since the trouble he made about my barn.\"    \"Then he hasn't been here to-day?\" asked Ned.    \"No; and not for a good many days.\"    Ned looked at Mr. Damon, and the two exchanged uneasy glances. Tom had  certainly started for the Kanker farm, and indeed had come to within a  few miles of it. That much was certain, as testified to by a number of  residents along the route from Shopton, who had seen the young inventor  passing in his car.    Now it appeared he had not arrived. The changed air of the farmer  seemed to indicate that he was speaking the truth.  Mr. Damon and Ned  were inclined to believe him. If they had any last, lingering doubts in  the matter, they were dispelled when Mr. Kanker said:    \"You can search the place if you like. I haven't any reason to feel  friendly toward you, but I certainly don't want to get into trouble  with the Government. Look around all you like.\"    \"No, we'll take your word for it,\" said Ned, quickly concluding that  now they had got the farmer where they wanted him, they could gain more  by an appearance of friendliness than by threats or harsh words. \"Then  you haven't seen him, either?\"    \"Not a sign of him.\"    \"One thing more,\" went on Tom's chum, \"and then we'll look farther.  Weren't you induced by a man named Simpson, or one named Blakeson, to  make the demand of three thousand dollars' damage for your barn?\"    \"No, it wasn't anybody of either of those names,\" admitted Mr. Kanker,  evidently a bit put out by the question.    \"It was some one, though, wasn't it?\" insisted Ned.    \"Waal, a man did come to me the day the barn was smashed, and just  afore it happened, and said an all-fired big traction engine was headed  this way, and that a young feller who was half crazy was running it.  This man--I don't know who he was, being a stranger to me--said if the  engine ran into any of my property and did damages I should collect for  it on the spot, or hold the machine.    \"Sure enough, that's what happened, and I did it. That man had an auto,  and he brought me and some of my men out to the smashed barn. That's  all I know about it.\"    \"I thought some one put you up to it,\" commented Ned.  \"This was some  of the gang's work,\" he went on to Mr. Damon.  \"They hoped to get  possession of Tom's tank long enough to find out some of the secrets.  By having the Liberty Bonds, I fooled 'em.\"    \"That's what you did!\" said Mr. Damon. \"But what can we do now?\"    \"I don't know,\" Ned was forced to admit. \"But I should think we'd  better go back to the last place where he was seen to pass in his auto,  and try to get on his trail.\"    Mr. Damon agreed that this was a wise plan, and, after a casual look  around the farmhouse and other buildings on Kanker's place and finding  nothing to arouse their suspicions, the two left in Ned's speedy little  machine.    \"It is mighty queer!\" remarked the young bank clerk, as they shot along  the country road. \"It isn't like Tom to get caught this way.\"    \"Maybe he isn't caught,\" suggested the other. \"Tom has been in many a  tight place and gotten out, as you and I well know.  Maybe it will be  the same now, though it does look suspicious, that fake message coming  from you.\"    \"Not coming from me, you mean,\" corrected Ned. \"Well, we'll do the best  we can.\"    They proceeded back to where they had last had a trace of Tom in his  machine, and there could only confirm what they had learned at first,  namely, that the young inventor had departed in the direction of the  Kanker farm, after having filled his radiator with water, and chatting  with a farmer he knew.    \"Then this is where the trail divides,\" said Ned, as they went back  over the road, coming to a point where the highway branched off. \"If he  went this way, he went to Kanker's place, or he would be in the way of  going. He isn't there, it seems, and didn't go there.\"    \"If he took the other road, where would he go?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Any one of a dozen places. I guess we'll have to follow the trail and  make all the inquiries we can.\"    But from the point where the two roads branched, all trace of Tom Swift  was lost. No one had seen him in his machine, though he was known to  more than one resident along the highway.    \"Well, what are we going to do?\" asked Mr. Damon, after they had  traveled some distance and had obtained no news.    \"Suppose we call up his home,\" suggested Ned, as they came to a country  store where there was a telephone. \"It may be he has returned. In that  case, all our worry has gone for nothing.\"    \"I don't believe it has,\" said Mr. Damon. \"But if we call up and ask if  Tom is back it will show we haven't found him, and his father will be  more worried than ever.\"    \"We can ask the telephone girl, and tell her to keep quiet about it,\"  decided Ned; and this they did.    But the answer that came back over the wire was discouraging. For Tom  had not returned, and there was no word from him. There was an urgent  message for him, too, from government officials regarding the tank, the  girl reported.    \"Well, we've just got to find him--that's all!\" declared Ned. \"I guess  we'll have to make a regular search of it. I did hope we'd find him out  at the Kanker farm. But since he isn't there, nor anywhere about, as  far as we can tell, we've got to try some other plan.\"    \"You"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#20)"],[1,"room instead of at  the girl. \"Oh, I came from a bed-quilt, I guess. That's what they say,  anyhow. Some call it a crazy-quilt and some a patchwork quilt. But my  name is Scraps--and now you know all about me.\"    \"Not quite all,\" returned Dorothy with a smile. \"I wish you'd tell me  how you came to be alive.\"    \"That's an easy job,\" said Scraps, sitting upon a big upholstered chair  and making the springs bounce her up and down. \"Margolotte wanted a  slave, so she made me out of an old bed-quilt she didn't use. Cotton  stuffing, suspender-button eyes, red velvet tongue, pearl beads for  teeth. The Crooked Magician made a Powder of Life, sprinkled me with it  and--here I am. Perhaps you've noticed my different colors. A very  refined and educated gentleman named the Scarecrow, whom I met, told me  I am the most beautiful creature in all Oz, and I believe it.\"    \"Oh! Have you met our Scarecrow, then?\" asked Dorothy, a little puzzled  to understand the brief history related.    \"Yes; isn't he jolly?\"    \"The Scarecrow has many good qualities,\" replied Dorothy. \"But I'm  sorry to hear all this 'bout the Crooked Magician. Ozma'll be mad as  hops when she hears he's been doing magic again. She told him not to.\"    \"He only practices magic for the benefit of his own family,\" explained  Bungle, who was keeping at a respectful distance from the little black  dog.    \"Dear me,\" said Dorothy; \"I hadn't noticed you before. Are you glass,  or what?\"    \"I'm glass, and transparent, too, which is more than can be said of  some folks,\" answered the cat. \"Also I have some lovely pink brains;  you can see 'em work.\"    \"Oh; is that so? Come over here and let me see.\"    The Glass Cat hesitated, eyeing the dog.    \"Send that beast away and I will,\" she said.    \"Beast! Why, that's my dog Toto, an' he's the kindest dog in all the  world. Toto knows a good many things, too; 'most as much as I do, I  guess.\"    \"Why doesn't he say anything?\" asked Bungle.    \"He can't talk, not being a fairy dog,\" explained Dorothy. \"He's just a  common United States dog; but that's a good deal; and I understand him,  and he understands me, just as well as if he could talk.\"    Toto, at this, got up and rubbed his head softly against Dorothy's  hand, which she held out to him, and he looked up into her face as if  he had understood every word she had said.    \"This cat, Toto,\" she said to him, \"is made of glass, so you mustn't  bother it, or chase it, any more than you do my Pink Kitten. It's  prob'ly brittle and might break if it bumped against anything.\"    \"Woof!\" said Toto, and that meant he understood.    The Glass Cat was so proud of her pink brains that she ventured to come  close to Dorothy, in order that the girl might \"see 'em work.\" This was  really interesting, but when Dorothy patted the cat she found the glass  cold and hard and unresponsive, so she decided at once that Bungle  would never do for a pet.    \"What do you know about the Crooked Magician who lives on the  mountain?\" asked Dorothy.    \"He made me,\" replied the cat; \"so I know all about him. The Patchwork  Girl is new--three or four days old--but I've lived with Dr. Pipt for  years; and, though I don't much care for him, I will say that he has  always refused to work magic for any of the people who come to his  house. He thinks there's no harm in doing magic things for his own  family, and he made me out of glass because the meat cats drink too  much milk. He also made Scraps come to life so she could do the  housework for his wife Margolotte.\"    \"Then why did you both leave him?\" asked Dorothy.    \"I think you'd better let me explain that,\" interrupted the Shaggy Man,  and then he told Dorothy all of Ojo's story and how Unc Nunkie and  Margolotte had accidentally been turned to marble by the Liquid of  Petrifaction. Then he related how the boy had started out in search of  the things needed to make the magic charm, which would restore the  unfortunates to life, and how he had found the Woozy and taken him  along because he could not pull the three hairs out of its tail.  Dorothy listened to all this with much interest, and thought that so  far Ojo had acted very well. But when the Shaggy Man told her of the  Munchkin boy's arrest by the Soldier with the Green Whiskers, because  he was accused of wilfully breaking a Law of Oz, the little girl was  greatly shocked.    \"What do you s'pose he's done?\" she asked.    \"I fear he has picked a six-leaved clover,\" answered the Shaggy Man,  sadly. \"I did not see him do it, and I warned him that to do so was  against the Law; but perhaps that is what he did, nevertheless.\"    \"I'm sorry 'bout that,\" said Dorothy gravely, \"for now there will be no  one to help his poor uncle and Margolotte 'cept this Patchwork Girl,  the Woozy and the Glass Cat.\"    \"Don't mention it,\" said Scraps. \"That's no affair of mine. Margolotte  and Unc Nunkie are perfect strangers to me, for the moment I came to  life they came to marble.\"    \"I see,\" remarked Dorothy with a sigh of regret; \"the woman forgot to  give you a heart.\"    \"I'm glad she did,\" retorted the Patchwork Girl. \"A heart must be a  great annoyance to one. It makes a person feel sad or sorry or devoted  or sympathetic--all of which sensations interfere with one's happiness.\"    \"I have a heart,\" murmured the Glass Cat. \"It's made of a ruby; but I  don't imagine I shall let it bother me about helping Unc Nunkie and  Margolotte.\"    \"That's a pretty hard heart of yours,\" said Dorothy. \"And the Woozy, of  course--\"    \"Why, as for me,\" observed the Woozy, who was reclining on the floor  with his legs doubled under him, so that he looked much like a square  box, \"I have never seen those unfortunate people you are speaking of,  and yet I am sorry for them, having at times been unfortunate myself.  When I was shut up in that forest I longed for some one to help me, and  by and by Ojo came and did help me. So I'm willing to help his uncle.  I'm only a stupid beast, Dorothy, but I can't help that, and if you'll  tell me what to do to help Ojo and his uncle, I'll gladly do it.\"    Dorothy walked over and patted the Woozy on his square head.    \"You're not pretty,\" she said, \"but I like you. What are you able to  do; anything 'special?\"    \"I can make my eyes flash fire--real fire--when I'm angry. When anyone  says: 'Krizzle-Kroo' to me I get angry, and then my eyes flash fire.\"    \"I don't see as fireworks could help Ojo's uncle,\" remarked Dorothy.  \"Can you do anything else?\"    \"I--I thought I had a very terrifying growl,\" said the Woozy, with  hesitation; \"but perhaps I was mistaken.\"    \"Yes,\" said the Shaggy Man, \"you were certainly wrong about that.\" Then  he turned to Dorothy and added: \"What will become of the Munchkin boy?\"    \"I don't know,\" she said, shaking her head thoughtfully. \"Ozma will see  him 'bout it, of course, and then she'll punish him. But how, I don't  know, 'cause no one ever has been punished in Oz since I knew anything  about the place. Too bad, Shaggy Man, isn't it?\"    While they were talking Scraps had been roaming around the room and  looking at all the pretty things it contained. She had carried Ojo's  basket in her hand, until now, when she decided to see what was inside  it. She found the bread and cheese, which she had no use for, and the  bundle of charms, which were curious but quite a mystery to her. Then,  turning these over, she came upon the six-leaved clover which the boy  had plucked.    Scraps was quick-witted, and although she had no heart she recognized  the fact that Ojo was her first friend. She knew at once that because  the boy had taken the clover he had been imprisoned, and she understood  that Ojo had given her the basket so they would not find the clover in  his possession and have proof of his crime. So, turning her head to see  that no one noticed her, she took the clover from the basket and  dropped it into a golden vase that stood on Dorothy's table. Then she  came forward and said to Dorothy:    \"I wouldn't care to help Ojo's uncle, but I will help Ojo. He did not  break the Law--no one can prove he did--and that green-whiskered  soldier had no right to arrest him.\"    \"Ozma ordered the boy's arrest,\" said Dorothy, \"and of course she knew  what she was doing. But if you can prove Ojo is innocent they will set  him free at once.\"    \"They'll have to prove him guilty, won't they?'' asked Scraps.    \"I s'pose so.\"    \"Well, they can't do that,\" declared the Patchwork Girl.    As it was nearly time for Dorothy to dine with Ozma, which she did  every evening, she rang for a servant and ordered the Woozy taken to a  nice room and given plenty of such food as he liked best.    \"That's honey-bees,\" said the Woozy.    \"You can't eat honey-bees, but you'll be given something just as nice,\"  Dorothy told him. Then she had the Glass Cat taken to another room for  the night and the Patchwork Girl she kept in one of her own rooms, for  she was much interested in the strange creature and wanted to talk with  her again and try to understand her better.          Chapter Seventeen    Ozma and Her Friends      The Shaggy Man had a room of his own in the royal palace, so there he  went to change his shaggy suit of clothes for another just as shaggy  but not so dusty from travel. He selected a costume of pea-green and  pink satin and velvet, with embroidered shags on all the edges and  iridescent pearls for ornaments. Then he bathed in an alabaster pool  and brushed his shaggy hair and whiskers the wrong way to make them  still more shaggy. This accomplished, and arrayed in his splendid  shaggy garments, he went to Ozma's banquet hall and found the  Scarecrow, the Wizard and Dorothy already assembled there. The  Scarecrow had made a quick trip and returned to the Emerald City with  his left ear freshly painted.    A moment later, while they all stood in waiting, a servant threw open a  door, the orchestra struck up a tune and Ozma of Oz entered."]]]
