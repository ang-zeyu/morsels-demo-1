Gr.  understands those, whose persons were disfigured by dishonorable wounds,  or who had mutilated themselves to avoid military duty. Gün. includes  both ideas: _quocunque_, non tantum _venereo_, corporis abusu contempti.    _Insuper_==superne. So 16: multo _insuper_ fimo onerant.    _Diversitas_ is a post-Augustan word, cf. Freund, sub v.    _Illuc respicit. Has respect to this principle. Scelera==crimes;  flagitia==vices, low and base actions. Scelus_ poena, _flagitium_  contemptu dignum. Gün.    _Levioribus delictis_. Abl. abs.==_when lighter offences are committed_;  or abl. of circum.==_in case of lighter offences_.    _Pro modo poenarum_. Such is the reading of all the MSS. _Pro modo,  poena_ is an ingenious _conjecture_ of Acidalius. But it is unnecessary.  Render thus: _in case of lighter offences, the convicted persons are  mulcted in a number of horses or cattle, in proportion to the severity of  the sentence adjudged to be due_.    _Qui vindicatur. The injured party_, or _plaintiff_. This principle  of pecuniary satisfaction was carried to great lengths among the  Anglo-Saxons. See Turner, as cited, 21.    _Qui reddunt_. Whose _business_ or _custom_ it is to administer justice,  etc. E. proposes _reddant_. But it is without authority and would give a  less appropriate sense.    _Centeni_. Cf. note, § 6: centeni ex singulis pagis. \"Sunt in quibusdam  locis Germaniae, velut Palatinatu, Franconia, etc. Zentgericht  (hundred-courts),\" cf. Bernegger.    _Consilia et auctoritas_. Abstract for concrete==_his advisers and the  supporters of his dignity_.      XIII. _Nihil nisi armati_. The _Romans_ wore arms only in time of war or  on a journey.    _Moris_, sc. est. A favorite expression of T. So 21: concedere moris  (est). And in A. 39.    _Suffecturum probaverit. On examination has pronounced him competent_  (sc. to bear arms). Subj. after _antequam_. H. 523, II.; Z. 576.    _Ornant. Ornat_ would have been more common Latin, and would have made  better English. But this construction is not unfrequent in T., cf. 11:  rex vel princeps audiuntur. Nor is it without precedent in other authors.  Cf. Z. 374. Ritter reads _propinqui_. The attentive reader will discover  here traces of many subsequent usages of _chivalry_.    _Haec toga_. This is the badge of manhood among the Germans, as the toga  virilis was among the Romans. The Romans assumed the toga at the age of  seventeen. The Athenians were reckoned as [Greek: Ephaeboi] at the same  age, Xen. Cyr, 1, 2, 8. The Germans (in their colder climate) not till  the 20th year. Caes. B.G. 6, 21.    _Dignationem. Rank, title_. It differs from _dignitas_ in being more  external. Cf. H. 1, 19: _dignatio Caesaris_; 8, 80: _dignatio viri_.  Ritter reads _dignitatem_.    _Assignant. High birth or great merits of their fathers assign_ (i.e.  mark out, not consign, or fully confer) _the title of chief even to young  men_.    _Gradus--habet_. Observe the emphatic position of _gradus_, and the force  of _quin etiam ipse: Gradations of rank, moreover the retinue itself  has_, i.e. the retainers are not only distinguished as a body in  following such a leader, _but_ there are _also distinctions_ among  _themselves. Quin etiam_ seldom occupies the second place. T. is fond of  anastrophe. Cf. Böt. Lex. Tac.    _Si--emineat. If he_ (cuique) _stands pre-eminent for the number and  valor of his followers. Comitatus_ is gen. _Emineat_, subj. pres. H. 504  et 509; Z. 524.    _Ceteris--aspici_. These noble youth, thus designated to the rank of  chieftains, _attach themselves_ (for a time, with some followers perhaps)  _to the other_ chiefs, who are _older and already distinguished, nor are  they ashamed to be seen among their attendants_.    _Quibus--cui_, sc. sit==_who shall have_, etc.    _Ipsa fama. Mere reputation_ or _rumor_ without coming to arms.    _Profligant_==ad finem perducunt. So Kiessling, Bötticher and Freund.  Ritter makes it==_propellunt_, frighten away. _Profligare bella,  proelia_, &c., is Tacitean. _Profligare hostes_, etc., is the common  expression.      XIV. _Jam vero_==porro. Cf. Böt. Lex. Tac. It marks a transition to a  topic of special importance. Cf. H. 1, 2. See Död, in loc.    _Recessisse_. All the best Latin writers are accustomed to use the  preterite after pudet, taedet, and other words of the like signification.  Gün. The cause of shame is prior to the shame.    _Infame_. \"When Chonodomarus, king of the Alemanni, was taken prisoner by  the Romans, his military companions, to the number of two hundred, and  three of the king's most intimate friends, thinking it a most flagitious  crime to live in safety after such an event, surrendered themselves to be  loaded with fetters. Ammian. Marcell, 16, 12, 60. There are instances of  the same kind in Tacitus.\" Mur. Cf. also Caes. B.G. 3, 22. 7, 40.    _Defendere, to defend him_, when attacked; _tueri, to protect him_ at all  times.    _Praecipuum sacramentum. Their most sacred duty_, Gün. and K.; _or the  chief part of their oath_, Gr.--_Clarescunt--tuentur_. So Ritter after  the best MSS. Al. _clarescant--tueantur_, or _tueare_.    _Non nisi_. In Cic. usually separated by a word or a clause. In T.  generally brought together.    _Exigunt. They expect.--Illum--illam_. Angl. _this--that_, cf.  _hinc--hinc_, A. 25.--_Bellatorem equum_. Cf. Virg. G. 2, 145.    _Incompti--apparatus. Entertainments, though inelegant yet liberal.  Apparatus_ is used in the same way, Suet. Vitel. 10 and 13.--_Cedunt_==  iis dantur. Gün.    _Nec arare_, etc. The whole language of this sentence is poetical, e.g.  the use of the inf. after _persuaseris_, of _annum_ for annuam mensem,  the sense of _vocare_ and _mereri_, &c. _Vocare_, i.e. provocare, cf. H.  4, 80, and Virg. Geor. 4, 76. _Mereri, earn, deserve_, i.e. by bravery.    _Pigrum et iners_. Piger est natura ad laborem tardus; iners, in quo  nihil artis et virtutis. K. Render: _a mark of stupidity and incapacity_.    _Quin immo. Nay but, nay more_. These words connect the clause, though  not placed at the beginning, as they are by other writers. They seem to  be placed after _pigrum_ in order to throw it into an emphatic position.  So _gradus quin etiam_, 13, where see note.--_Possis_. You, i.e., any one  can. Z. 524. Cf. note II. 1, 10: _laudares_. So _persuaseris_ in the  preceding sentence. The subj. gives a contingent or potential turn==_can  procure_, sc. if you will _would persuade_, sc. if you should try. An  indefinite person is always addressed in the subj. in Latin, even when  the ind. would be used if a definite person were addressed. Z. 524.    In the chieftains and their retainers, as described in the last two  sections, the reader cannot fail to discover the germ of the feudal  system. Cf. Montesq. Sp. of Laws, 30, 3, 4; also Robertson's Chas. V.      XV. _Non multum_. The common reading (multum without the negative) is a  mere conjecture, and that suggested by a misapprehension of the meaning  of T. _Non multum_ is to be taken comparatively. Though in time of peace  they hunt often, yet they spend _so much more time in eating, drinking,  and sleeping_, that the former is comparatively small. Thus understood,  this passage of T. is not inconsistent with the declarations of Caesar,  B.G. 6, 21: Vita Germanorum omnis in venationibus atque in studiis rei  militaris consistit. Caesar leaves out of account their periods of  inaction, and speaks only of their active employments, which were war and  the chase. It was the special object of Tacitus, on the contrary, to give  prominence to that striking feature of the German character which Caesar  overlooks; and therein, as Wr. well observes, the later historian shows  his more exact acquaintance with the Germans. _Non multum_, as opposed to  _plus_, is nearly equivalent to _minus_.    _Venatibus, per otium_. Enallage for _venatibus, otio_, H. 704, III. This  figure is very frequent in T., e.g. § 40: per obsequium, proeliis; A. 9:  virtute aut per artem; A. 41: temeritate aut per ignaviam, &c. Seneca,  and indeed most Latin authors, prefer a _similar_ construction in  antithetic clauses; T. seems rather to avoid it. In all such cases  however, as the examples just cited show, _per_ with the acc. is not  precisely equivalent to the abl. The abl. is more active and implies  means, agency; the acc. with _per_ is more passive and denotes manner or  occasion.    _Delegata, transferred_.    _Familiae. Household_, properly of servants (from famel, Oscan for  servant), as in chapp. 25 and 32: but sometimes the whole family, as here  and in chap. 7: _familiae et propinquitates_.    _Ipsi_. The men of middle life, the heads of the _familiae_.    _Diversitate. Contrariety.--Ament_. Subj. H. 518, I.; Z. 577.--  _Oderint_. Perf. in the sense of the pres. H. 297, I. 2; Z. 221.    _Inertiam. Inertiam==idleness_, freedom from business and care (from _in_  and _ars_); _quietem==tranquillity_, a life of undisturbed repose without  action or excitement. Cf. 14: _ingrata genti quies_. In this account of  the habits of the Germans, one might easily fancy, he was reading a  description of the manner of life among our American Indians. It may be  remarked here, once for all, that this resemblance may be traced in very  many particulars, e.g. in their personal independence, in the military  chieftains and their followers, in their extreme fondness for the  hardships and dangers of war, in their strange inactivity, gluttony and  drunkenness in peace, in their deliberative assemblies and the power of  eloquence to sway their counsels, in their half elective, half hereditary  form of government, in the spirituality of their conceptions of God, and  some other features of their religion (Robertson has drawn out this  comparison in his history of Charles V). All tribes in a rude and savage  state must have many similar usages and traits of character. And this  resemblance between the well-known"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],[0,"Robert's Rules of Order (#20)"],[1,"all other cases, entitled to  the floor to close the debate; after which, the chairman immediately  puts the questions to the assembly, first, on the motion to commit, if  it is pending; if this is carried, of course the subject goes to the  committee; if, however, it fails, the vote is next taken on amendments,  and finally on the resolution as amended.    If a motion to postpone, either definitely or indefinitely, or a motion  to reconsider, or an appeal is pending, the previous question is  exhausted by the vote on the postponement, reconsideration or appeal,  and does not cut off debate upon any other motions that may be pending.  If the call for the previous question fails, that is, the debate is not  cut off, the debate continues the same as if this motion had not been  made.  The previous question can be called for simply on an amendment,  and after the amendment has been acted upon, the main question is again  open to debate.    (b) An order limiting or closing debate.  Sometimes, instead of cutting  off debate entirely by ordering the previous question, it is desirable  to allow of but very limited debate.  In    === Page 138 ===========================================================    this case, a motion is made to limit the time allowed each speaker or  the number of speeches on each side, or to appoint a time at which  debate shall close and the question be put.  The motion may be made to  limit debate on an amendment, in which case the main question would  afterwards be open to debate and amendment; or it may be made simply on  an amendment to an amendment.    In ordinary societies, where harmony is so important, a two-thirds vote  should be required for the adoption of any of the above motions to cut  off or limit debate.* [In the House of Representatives, these motions  require only a majority vote for their adoption.  In the Senate, to the  contrary, not even two-thirds of the members can force a measure to its  passage without allowing debate, the Senate rules not recognizing the  above motions.    59. To Suppress the Question.  (a) Objection to the consideration of a  question.  Sometimes a resolution is introduced that the assembly do not  wish to consider at all, because it is profitless, or irrelevant to the  objects of the assembly, or for other reasons.  The proper course to  pursue in such case, is for some one, as soon as it is introduced, to  \"object to the consideration of the question.\"  This objection not  requiring a second, the chairman immediately    === Page 139 ===========================================================    puts the question, \"Will the assembly consider this question?\"  If  decided in the negative by a two-thirds vote, the question is  immediately dismissed, and cannot be again introduced during that  session.  This objection must be made when the question is first  introduced, before it has been debated, and it can be made when another  member has the floor.    (b) Postpone indefinitely.  After the question has been debated, the  proper motion to use in order to suppress the question for the session,  is to postpone indefinitely.  It cannot be made while any motion except  the original or main question is pending, but it can be made after an  amendment has been acted upon, and the main question, as amended, is  before the assembly.  It opens the merits of the main question to debate  to as great an extent as if the main question were before the assembly.  On account of these two facts, in assemblies with short sessions it is  not very useful, as the same result can usually be more easily attained  by the next motion.    (c) Lie on the table.  If there is no possibility during the remainder  of the session of obtaining a majority vote for taking up the question,  then the quickest way of suppressing it is    === Page 140 ===========================================================    to move \"that the question lie on the table;\" which, allowing of no  debate, enables the majority to instantly lay the question on the table,  from which it cannot be taken without their consent.    From its high rank [Sec. 64] and undebatable character, this motion is very  commonly used to suppress a question, but, as shown in Sec. 57 (b), its  effect is merely to lay the question aside till the assembly choose to  consider it, and it only suppresses the question so long as there is a  majority opposed to its consideration.    60. To Consider a question a second time.  Reconsider.  When a question  has been once adopted, rejected or suppressed, it cannot be again  considered during that session [Sec. 70], except by a motion to \"reconsider  the vote\" on that question.  This motion can only be made by one who  voted on the prevailing side, and on the day the vote was taken which it  is proposed to reconsider.* [In Congress it can be made on the same or  succeeding day; and if the yeas and nays were not taken on the vote, any  one can move the reconsideration.  The yeas and nays are however ordered  on all important votes in Congress, which is not the case in ordinary  societies.] It can be made and entered on the minutes in the midst of  debate, even when another member has the floor, but cannot be considered  until there is no question    === Page 141 ===========================================================    before the assembly, when, if called up, it takes precedence of every  motion except to adjourn and to fix the time to which the assembly shall  adjourn.    A motion to reconsider a vote on a debatable question, opens to debate  the entire merits of the original motion.  If the question to be  reconsidered is undebatable, then the reconsideration is undebatable.    If the motion to reconsider is carried, the chairman announces that the  question now recurs on the adoption of the question the vote on which  has been just reconsidered:  the original question is now in exactly the  same condition that it was in before the first vote was taken on its  adoption, and must be disposed of by a vote.    When a motion to reconsider is entered on the minutes, it need not be  called up by the mover till the next meeting, on a succeeding day.* [If  the assembly has not adopted these or similar rules, this paragraph  would not apply, but this motion to reconsider would, like any other  motion, fall to the ground if not acted upon before the close of the  session at which the original vote was adopted.] If he fails to call it  up then, any one else can do so.  But should there be no succeeding  meeting, either adjourned or regular, within a month, then the effect of  the motion to reconsider    === Page 142 ===========================================================    terminates with the adjournment of the meeting at which it was made, and  any one can call it up at that meeting.    In general no motion (except to adjourn) that has been once acted upon,  can again be considered during the same session, except by a motion to  reconsider.  [The motion to adjourn can be renewed if there has been  progress in business or debate, and it cannot be reconsidered.] But this  rule does not prevent the renewal of any of the motions mentioned in Sec.  64, provided the question before the assembly has in any way changed;  for in this case, while the motions are nominally the same, they are in  fact different.* [Thus to move to postpone a resolution is a different  question from moving to postpone it after it has been amended.  A motion  to suspend the rules for a certain purpose cannot be renewed at the same  meeting, but can be at an adjourned meeting.  A call for the orders of  the day that has been negatived, cannot be renewed while the question  then before the assembly is still under consideration.  See Rules of  Order, Sec. 27, for many peculiarities of this motion.]    61. Order and Rules.  (a) Orders of the Day.  Sometimes an assembly  decides that certain questions shall be considered at a particular time,  and when that time arrives those questions constitute what is termed the  \"orders of the day,\" and if any member \"calls for the orders of the  day,\" as it requires no second, the    === Page 143 ===========================================================    chairman immediately puts the question, thus:  \"Will the assembly now  proceed to the orders of the day?\"  If carried, the subject under  consideration is laid aside, and the questions appointed for that time  are taken up in their order.  When the time arrives, the chairman may  state that fact, and put the above question without waiting for a  motion.  If the motion fails, the call for the orders of the day cannot  be renewed till the subject then before the assembly is disposed of.*  [In Congress, a member entitled to the floor cannot be interrupted by a  call for the orders of the day.  In an ordinary assembly, the most  common case where orders of the day are decided upon is where it is  necessary to make a programme for the session.  When the hour arrives  for the consideration of any subject on the programme, these rules  permit any member to call for the orders of the day (as described in  Rules of Order, Sec. 2) even though another person has the floor.  If this  were not permitted, it would often be impossible to carry out the  programme, though wished for by the majority.  A majority could postpone  the orders of the day, when called for, so as to continue the discussion  of the question then before the assembly.  An order as to the time when  any subject shall be considered, must not be confounded with the rules  of the assembly; the latter must be enforced by the chairman, without  they are suspended by a two-thirds vote; the former, in strictness, can  only be carried out by the order of a majority of the assembly then  present and voting.]    (b) Special Order.  If a subject is of such importance that it is  desired to consider it at a special time in preference to the orders of  the day and established order"]]]
