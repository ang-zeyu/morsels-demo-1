There are three in the  water and manned already. There they come. Now, then, call up all  hands.\"    In a few seconds the crew of the West Indiaman were at their stations  ready for action, and Captain Ellice, with Fred at his elbow, stood  beside one of the stern-chasers. Meanwhile, the boats of the pirate,  five in number, pulled away in different directions, evidently with the  intention of attacking the ship at different points. They were full of  men armed to the teeth. While they rowed towards the ship the schooner  resumed its fire, and one ball cut away the spanker-boom and slightly  wounded two of the men with splinters. The guns of the ship were now  brought to bear on the boats, but without effect, although the shot  plunged into the water all round them. As they drew nearer a brisk fire  of musketry was opened on them, and the occasional falling of an oar and  confusion on board showed that the shots told. The pirates replied  vigorously, but without effect, as the men of the ship were sheltered by  the bulwarks.    \"Pass the word to load and reserve fire,\" said the captain; \"and hand me  a musket, Fred. Load again as fast as I fire.\" So saying, the captain  took aim and fired at the steersman of the largest boat, which pulled  towards the stern. \"Another, Fred--\"    At this moment a withering volley was poured upon the boat, and a savage  yell of agony followed, while the rowers who remained unhurt paused for  an instant as if paralyzed. Next instant they recovered, and another  stroke would have brought them almost alongside, when Captain Ellice  pointed the little carronade and fired. There was a terrific crash; the  gun recoiled violently to the other side of the deck; and the pirate  boat sank, leaving the sea covered with dead and wounded men. A number,  however, who seemed to bear charmed lives, seized their cutlasses with  their teeth, and swam boldly for the ship. This incident, unfortunately,  attracted too much of the attention of the crew, and ere they could  prevent it another boat reached the bow of the ship, the crew of which  sprang up the side like cats, formed on the forecastle, and poured a  volley upon the men.    \"Follow me, lads!\" shouted the captain, as he sprang forward like a  tiger. The first man he reached fell by a ball from his pistol; in  another moment the opposing parties met in a hand-to-hand conflict.  Meanwhile Fred, having been deeply impressed with the effect of the shot  from the little carronade, succeeded in raising and reloading it. He had  scarcely accomplished this when one of the boats reached the larboard  quarter, and two of the men sprang up the side. Fred observed them, and  felled the first with a handspike before he reached the deck; but the  pirate who instantly followed would have killed him had he not been  observed by the second mate, who had prevented several of the men from  joining in the _melee_ on the forecastle in order to meet such an  emergency as this. Rushing to the rescue with his party, he drove the  pirates back into the boat, which was immediately pulled towards the  bow, where the other two boats were now grappling and discharging their  crews on the forecastle. Although the men of the West Indiaman fought  with desperate courage, they could not stand before the increasing  numbers of pirates who now crowded the fore part of the ship in a dense  mass. Gradually they were beaten back, and at length were brought to bay  on the quarter-deck.    \"Help, father!\" cried Fred, pushing through the struggling crowd,  \"here's the carronade ready loaded.\"    \"Ha! boy, well done!\" cried the captain, seizing the gun, and, with the  help of Buzzby, who never left his side, dragging it forward. \"Clear the  way, lads!\"    In a moment the little cannon was pointed to the centre of the mass of  men, and fired. One awful shriek of agony rose above the din of the  fight, as a wide gap was cut through the crowd; but this only seemed to  render the survivors more furious. With a savage yell they charged the  quarter-deck, but were hurled back again and again by the captain and a  few chosen men who stood around him. At length one of the pirates, who  had been all along conspicuous for his strength and daring, stepped  deliberately up, and pointing a pistol at the captain's breast, fired.  Captain Ellice fell, and at the same moment a ball laid the pirate low;  another charge was made; Fred rushed forward to protect his father, but  was thrown down and trodden under foot in the rush, and in two minutes  more the ship was in possession of the pirates.    Being filled with rage at the opposition they had met with, these  villains proceeded, as they said, to make short work of the crew, while  several of them sprang into the cabin, where they discovered Mrs.  Ellice almost dead with terror. Dragging her violently on deck, they  were about to cast her into the sea, when Buzzby, who stood with his  hands bound, suddenly burst his bonds and sprang towards her. A blow  from the butt of a pistol, however, stretched him insensible on the  deck.    \"Where is my husband? my boy?\" screamed Mrs. Ellice wildly.    \"They've gone before you, or they'll soon follow,\" said a savage  fiercely, as he raised her in his powerful arms and hurled her  overboard. A loud shriek was followed by a heavy plunge. At the same  moment two of the men raised the captain, intending to throw him  overboard also, when a loud boom arrested their attention, and a  cannon-shot ploughed up the sea close in front of their bows.    While the fight was raging, no one had observed the fact that the breeze  had freshened, and a large man-of-war, with American colours, at her  peak, was now within gunshot of the ship. No sooner did the pirates make  this discovery than they rushed to their boats, with the intention of  pulling to their schooner; but those who had been left in charge, seeing  the approach of the man-of-war, and feeling that there was no chance of  escape for their comrades, or, as is more than probable, being utterly  indifferent about them, crowded all sail and slipped away, and it was  now hull-down on the horizon to leeward. The men in the boats rowed  after her with the energy of despair; but the Americans gave chase, and  we need scarcely add that, in a very short time, all were captured.    When the man-of-war rejoined the West Indiaman, the night had set in and  a stiff breeze had arisen, so that the long and laborious search that  was made for the body of poor Mrs. Ellice proved utterly fruitless.  Captain Ellice, whose wound was very severe, was struck down as if by a  thunderbolt, and for a long time his life was despaired of. During his  illness Fred nursed him with the utmost tenderness, and in seeking to  comfort his father, found some relief to his own stricken heart.    Months passed away. Captain Ellice was conveyed to the residence of his  sister in Grayton, and, under her care, and the nursing of his little  niece Isobel, he recovered his wonted health and strength. To the eyes  of men Captain Ellice and his son were themselves again; but those who  judge of men's hearts by their outward appearance and expressions, in  nine cases out of ten judge very wide of the mark indeed. Both had  undergone a great change. The brilliancy and glitter of this world had  been completely and rudely dispelled, and both had been led to inquire  whether there was not something better to live for than mere present  advantage and happiness--something that would stand by them in those  hours of sickness and sorrow which must inevitably, sooner or later,  come upon all men. Both sought, and discovered what they sought, in the  _Bible_, the only book in all the world where the jewel of great price  is to be found.    But Captain Ellice could not be induced to resume the command of his  old ship, or voyage again to the West Indies. He determined to change  the scene of his future labours and sail to the Frozen Seas, where the  aspect of every object, even the ocean itself, would be very unlikely to  recall the circumstances of his loss.    Some time after his recovery, Captain Ellice purchased a brig and fitted  her out as a whaler, determined to try his fortune in the Northern Seas.  Fred pleaded hard to be taken out, but his father felt that he had more  need to go to school than to sea; so he refused, and Fred, after sighing  very deeply once or twice, gave in with a good grace. Buzzby, too, who  stuck to his old commander like a leech, was equally anxious to go; but  Buzzby, in a sudden and unaccountable fit of tenderness, had, just two  months before, married a wife, who might be appropriately described as  \"fat, fair, and forty,\" and Buzzby's wife absolutely forbade him to go.  Alas! Buzzby was no longer his own master. At the age of forty-five he  became--as he himself expressed it--an abject slave, and he would as  soon have tried to steer in a slipper-bath right in the teeth of an  equinoctial hurricane, as have opposed the will of his wife. He used to  sigh gruffly when spoken to on this subject, and compare himself to a  Dutch galliot that made more leeway than headway, even with a wind on  the quarter. \"Once,\" he would remark, \"I was clipper-built, and could  sail right in the wind's eye; but ever since I tuck this craft in tow,  I've gone to leeward like a tub. In fact, I find there's only one way of  going ahead with my Poll, and that is right before the wind! I used to  yaw about a good deal at first, but she tuck that out o' me in a day or  two. If I put the helm only so much as one stroke to starboard, she guv'  a tug at the tow-rope that brought the wind dead aft again; so I've gi'n  it up, and lashed the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#3)"],[1,"of the English Language    Chapter VIII.
