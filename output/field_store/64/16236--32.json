And where the monster's sting?\"    3 If sin be pardon'd I'm secure,  Death hath no sting beside;  The law gives sin its damning power,  But Christ, my ransom, died.    4 Now to the God of victory  Immortal thanks be paid,  Who makes us conquerors while we die,  Thro' Christ our living head.      Hymn 1:18.  Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, Rev. 14. 13.    1 Hear what the voice from heaven proclaims,  For all the pious dead,  Sweet is the savour of their names,  And soft their sleeping bed.    2 They die in Jesus, and are bless'd;  How kind their slumbers are!  From sufferings and from sins releas'd,  And freed from every snare.    3 Far from this world of toil and strife,  They're present with the Lord;  The labours of their mortal life  End in a large reward.      Hymn 1:19.  The song of Simeon; or, Death made desirable,  Luke 2. 27 &c.    1 Lord at thy temple we appear,  As happy Simeon came,  And hope to meet our Saviour here;  O make our joys the same!    2 With what divine and vast delight  The good old man was fill'd,  When fondly in his wither'd arms  He clasp'd the holy child!    3 \"Now I can leave this world,\" he cry'd,  \"Behold thy servant dies,  \"I've seen thy great salvation, Lord,  \"And close my peaceful eyes.    4 \"This is the light prepar'd to shine  \"Upon the Gentile lands,  \"Thine Israel's glory, and their hope  \"To break their slavish bands.\"    5 [Jesus, the vision of thy face  Hath overpowering charms  Scarce shall I feel death's cold embrace  If Christ be in my arms.    6 Then while ye hear my heart-strings break,  How sweet my minutes roll!  A mortal paleness on my cheek,  And glory in my soul.]      Hymn 1:20.  Spiritual apparel; namely, the robe of righteousness,  and garments of salvation, Isa. 61. 10.    1 Awake, my heart, arise, my tongue,  Prepare a tuneful voice,  In God the life of all my joys,  Aloud will I rejoice.    2 'Tis he adorn'd my naked soul,  And made salvation mine,  Upon a poor polluted worm  He makes his graces shine.    3 And lest the shadow of a spot  Should on my soul be found,  He took the robe the Saviour wrought,  And cast it all around.    4 How far the heavenly robe exceeds  What earthly princes wear!  These ornaments, how bright they shine!  How white the garments are!    5 The Spirit wrought my faith and love,  And hope, and every grace;  But Jesus spent his life to work  The robe of righteousness.    6 Strangely, my soul, art thou array'd  By the great sacred Three:  In sweetest harmony of praise  Let all thy powers agree.      Hymn 1:21.  A vision of the kingdom of Christ among men,  Rev. 21. 1-4.    1 Lo, what a glorious sight appears  To our believing eyes!  The earth and sea are pass'd away,  And the old rolling skies.    2 From the third heaven where God resides,  That holy happy place,  The New Jerusalem comes down  Adorn'd with shining grace.    3 Attending angels shout for joy,  And the bright armies sing,  \"Mortals, behold the sacred seat  \"Of your descending King.    4 \"The God of glory down to men  \"Removes his blest abode,  \"Men the dear objects of his grace,  \"And he the loving God.    5 \"His own soft hand shall wipe the tears  \"From every weeping eye,  \"And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,  \"And death itself shall die.\"    6 How long, dear Saviour, O how long,  Shall this bright hour delay!  Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time,  And bring the welcome day.      Hymn 1:22. [Supplement.]  Flesh and Spirit. Rom. 8. 1.    1 What vain desires, and passions vain,  Attend this mortal clay!  Oft have they pierc'd my soul with pain,  And drawn my heart astray.    2 How have I wander'd from my God,  And following sin and shame  In this vile world of flesh and blood  Defil'd my nobler frame!    3 For ever blessed be thy grace  That form'd my soul anew,  And made it of an heaven-born race,  Thy glory to pursue.    4 My spirit holds perpetual war,  And wrestles and complains;  But views the happy moment near  That shall dissolve its chains.    5 Cheerful in death I close my eyes,  To part with every lust;  And charge my flesh whene'er it rise  To leave them in the dust.    6 My purer spirit shall not fear  To put this body on:  Its tempting powers no more are there,  Its lusts and passions gone.      Hymn 1:23. [Supplement.]  A hopeful youth falling short of heaven, Mark 10. 21.    1 Must all the charms of nature then  So hopeless to salvation prove?  Can hell demand, can heaven condemn  The man whom Jesus deigns to love?    2 The man who sought the ways of truth,  Paid friends and neighbours all their due,  (A modest, sober, lovely youth)  And thought he wanted nothing now.    3 But mark the change! thus spake the Lord,  \"Come, part with earth for heaven to-day,\"  The youth astonish'd at the word,  In silent sadness went his way.    4 Poor virtues that he boasted so,  This test unable to endure;  Let Christ, and grace, and glory go  To make his land and money sure.    5 Ah foolish choice of treasures here!  Ah fatal love of tempting gold!  Must this base world be bought so dear?  Are life and heaven so cheaply sold?    6 In vain the charms of nature shine,  If this vile passion govern me:  Transform my soul, O love divine,  And make me part with all for thee.      Hymn 1:24.  The rich sinner dying, Psalm 49. 6 9. Eccl. 8. 8.  Job 3. 14 15.    1 In vain the wealthy mortals toil,  And heap their shining dust in vain,  Look down and scorn the humble poor,  And boast their lofty hills of gain.    2 Their golden cordials cannot ease  Their pained hearts or aching heads,  Nor fright nor bribe approaching death  From glittering roofs and downy beds.    3 The lingering, the unwilling soul  The dismal summons must obey,  And bid a long a sad farewell  To the pale lump of lifeless clay.    4 Thence they are huddled to the grave,  Where kings and slaves have equal thrones;  Their bones without distinction lie  Amongst the heap of meaner bones.    The rest referred to Psalm 49.      Hymn 1:25.  A vision of the Lamb, Rev 5. 6-9.    1 All mortal vanities, be gone,  Nor tempt my eyes, nor tire my ears,  Behold amidst th' eternal throne  A vision of the Lamb appears.    2[Glory his fleecy robe adorns,  Mark'd with the bloody death he bore;  Seven are his eyes, and seven his horns,  To speak his wisdom and his power.    3 Lo, he receives a sealed book  From him that sits upon the throne:  Jesus, my Lord, prevails to look  On dark decrees, and things unknown.]    4 All the assembling saints around  Fall worshipping before the Lamb,  And in new songs of gospel-sound  Address their honours to his name,    5 The joy, the shout, the harmony  Flies o'er the everlasting hills,  \"Worthy art thou alone,\" they cry,  \"To read the book, to loose the seals.\"]    6 Our voices join the heavenly strain,  And with transporting pleasure sing,  \"Worthy the Lamb that once was slain,  \"To be our teacher and our king!\"    7 His words of prophecy reveal  Eternal counsels, deep designs;  His grace and vengeance shall fulfil  The peaceful and the dreadful lines.    8 Thou hast redeem'd our souls from hell  'With thine invaluable blood;  And wretches that did once rebel  Are now made favourites of their Cod.    9 Worthy for ever is the Lord,  That died for treasons not his own,  By every tongue to be ador'd,  And dwell upon his Father's throne.      Hymn 1:26.  Hope of heaven by the resurrection of Christ,  1 Peter 1. 3-5.    1 Bless'd be the everlasting God,  The Father of our Lord,  Be his abounding mercy prais'd,  His majesty ador'd.    2 When from the dead he rais'd his Son,  And call'd him to the sky,  He gave our souls a lively hope  That they should never die.    3 What tho' our inbred sins require  Our flesh to see the dust!  Yet as the Lord our Saviour rose,  So all his followers must.    4 There's an inheritance divine  Reserv'd against that day,  'Tis uncorrupted, undefil'd,  And cannot waste away.    5 Saints by the power of God are kept  Till the salvation come;  We walk by faith as strangers here  Till Christ shall call us home.      Hymn 1:27.  Assurance of heaven; or, A saint prepared to die,  2 Tim. 4. 6 7 8 18.    1 [Death may dissolve my body now,  And bear my spirit home;  Why do my minutes move so slow,  Nor my salvation come?    2 With heavenly weapons I have fought  The battles of the Lord,  Finish'd my course, and kept the faith,  And wait the sure reward.]    3 God has laid up in heaven for me  A crown which cannot fade;  The righteous Judge at that great day  Shall place it on my head.    4 Nor hath the King of grace decreed  This prize for me alone;  But all that love and long to see  Th' appearance of his Son.    5 Jesus the Lord shall guard me safe  From every ill design;  And to his heavenly kingdom keep  This feeble soul of mine.    6 God is my everlasting aid  And hell shall rage in vain;  To him be highest glory paid,  And endless praise.--Amen.      Hymn 1:28.  The triumph of Christ over the enemies of his church,  Isa. 63. 1 2 3 &c.    1 What mighty man, or mighty God,  Comes travelling in state,  Along the Idumean road,  Away from Bozrah's gate?    2 The glory of his robes proclaim  'Tis some victorious king:  \"'Tis I, the just, th' Almighty One,  \"That your salvation bring.\"    3 \"Why, mighty Lord,\" thy saints enquire,  \"Why thine apparel red?  \"And all thy vesture stain'd like those  \"Who in the wine-press tread?\"    4 \"I by myself have trod the press,  \"And crush'd my foes alone,  \"My wrath has struck the rebels dead,  \"My fury stamp'd them down.    5 \"'Tis Edom's blood that dyes my robes  \"With joyful scarlet stains,  \"The triumph that my raiment wears  \"Sprung from their bleeding veins.    6 \"Thus shall the nations be destroy'd  \"That dare insult my saints,  \"I have an arm t' avenge"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13347"],[0,"Wildflowers of the Farm (#3)"],[1,"yellow  flowers. Some of these are fully open, and we see that each blossom has  five pointed petals. The trailing stems have no flowers at all, they are  barren; but the leaves on the barren stems are much more numerous and  closer together than those on the upright flowering stems.    [Illustration: COMMON STONECROP.]    These leaves are very curious. They are not flat like the leaves of the  Red Valerian, the Toadflax, and most other flowers; they are very thick  and fleshy--something like a short round pointed stick. They grow close  against the stalk, not in pairs, but alternately, first a leaf on one  side of the stalk, then a leaf on the other. They are erect too; that  is, they point in the same direction as the stalk.    On the barren stems the leaves grow so closely that they quite cover the  stalk. They have a hot sharp taste, and the plant is sometimes called  \"Wall-Pepper.\" The roots are very thin and can spread easily through  narrow chinks of the wall.    We will see one more plant of the walls before we look for flowers  elsewhere. Our next plant is not very common at Willow Farm; still I  know where to look for it. Built against one side of the big barn in the  foldyard is a little lean-to shed. Often there are calves in it; but  just now we are more interested in something that is on the roof.    Standing close to the wall of the shed is a cattle crib--a kind of big  square box or trough on legs, in which hay or chaff is put for the  cattle. The shed is not very high, and by standing on the crib we can  scramble on to the roof. Here is the plant we want to see.    It is the Houseleek, of which a clump is growing between the tiles.  Almost flat on the tiles is a dense mass of large green fleshy leaves.  These leaves are evergreen, they do not die and fall off in winter. From  this cluster of leaves rise straight thick stems nearly a foot high. The  stems are thickly covered with erect leaves which grow smaller towards  the top of the stem.    At the top of the stem is a cluster of very handsome rosy-red flowers.  Each blossom is star-shaped when fully open, and generally has twelve  petals.    [Illustration: HOUSE LEEK.]    If we could see the roots we should find them very thread-like or  fibrous, like those of other flowers we have been looking at to-day. I  do not think I can very well show you the roots, however; we should have  to pull up a plant, and that would not please Ben, the cowman, at all.  There is a belief in country places that it is bad luck to disturb the  Houseleek--that someone in the house on which it grows is sure to die  soon afterwards. Certainly the plant is not growing on a house  here--only on the calves' cot. Still, if any misfortune should happen to  the calves we might be blamed by Ben. Besides, it would be a pity to  disturb so handsome a plant, would it not?    We have spent some time in looking at these flowers on the walls and  roof because we think them very wonderful. We see how little soil they  can have in which to grow, and how, in dry weather, they can have very  little moisture either. Yet the leaves of several of them are thick and  fleshy, and the flowers of some are large and beautiful. What could be  more handsome than the blossoms of the Wallflower, the Red Valerian, and  the Houseleek?          CHAPTER IV    THREE HANDSOME WEEDS      At the end of the drive, near the front door, another white gate leads  to the \"nag\" stables, where Mr. Hammond keeps the two horses which he  rides and drives. Billy, the old brown pony, has a little stable of his  own close by, and further on are the granary and the poultry yard.    Perhaps you have heard the saying, \"Ill weeds grow apace.\" It is  certainly a true one, for most of the plants which we call weeds grow  quickly and well wherever they are allowed to remain. We shall not have  far to look for the three weeds which I want to show you this morning.  The first of them is the Stinging Nettle. It grows round the wood-pile  in the middle of the poultry-yard, and there are great clumps of it  beside the hedge which divides the poultry-yard from the kitchen garden.    It is really a very handsome plant, though you may not have thought so  before. Look how tall and straight the stems are, and how evenly and  regularly the dark green pointed leaves grow from it. They grow in  pairs, on opposite sides of the stem, and are serrated. There is  something rather unusual about the stem of the Nettle which we will  notice at once. I have brought out a pair of thick leather gloves, so  that we can pick a stem without being stung.    You know what shape the trunks of trees are. Round? Yes; round or nearly  so. So are the stems of most plants; the stems of the Red Valerian are  round. The stem of the Nettle, however, is square, or if not perfectly  square, it has four distinct sides. Perhaps you had never noticed this  before, for the Nettle is certainly not a plant with which one cares to  have very much to do.    Both the stems and leaves are covered with tiny hairs. These hairs are  really small hollow tubes ending in a sharp point. When the Nettle  stings you it first pricks the skin with these sharp points, and then a  drop of poison falls from the tube into the wound the point has made.    If you happen to get stung by a nettle do _not_ bathe your hand with  cold water; that will only make the pain worse. While you are waiting  for the pain to pass off remember that in India there are nettles whose  sting causes great pain which lasts for several days. You might be much  worse off, you see!    The small greenish-yellow flowers of the Stinging Nettle grow in long  feathery clusters on stalks which spring from the main stem close to a  pair of leaves.    The young leaves of the Nettle are said to be very nice boiled as  vegetables; I cannot say that I have ever eaten them myself. Years ago  country people used to take a great deal of nettle tea as medicine in  spring. Nowadays they seem to prefer patent medicines from the chemist's  shop. A dye is made from the roots of the Nettle, and another dye from  the stem and leaves. The young leaves or tops, when chopped up, are good  for poultry, especially for turkeys. So nettles are useful, you see--not  merely stinging weeds. The Nettle, too, is a relation of the hemp plant  from which we get our string and ropes.    [Illustration: TRAVELLER'S JOY.]    You may sometimes see or hear of the White, Red, and Yellow Dead Nettle,  but these are not really nettles at all. Their leaves are somewhat  similar, but they are quite different plants.    Hanging over this great patch of nettles by the hedge there is another  weed, the Traveller's Joy, or Old Man's Beard. Its stem has climbed not  only up the hedge, but high into a hawthorn bush which stands there. It  has many small white feathery flowers with a pleasant scent. On each  leaf stem there are usually five leaflets, one at the end of the stem  and two pairs lower down. These leaf stems are long and tough, and it is  chiefly by them that the plant can climb as it does; they twine round  any branch or twig they touch, and give the Traveller's Joy a firm  support. I have seen trees in woods covered with this plant to a height  of twenty feet from the ground.    In the autumn and early winter you would admire the Traveller's Joy as  much as you do now. The flowers will certainly be gone, but each seed  which takes the place of a blossom will have a little plume of silky  white threads attached to it--a sort of feathery tail. These serve as  wings by which the seeds are often carried long distances by the wind.  The seeds of some other plants which we shall see have something of the  same kind.    There is another climbing plant in the hedge, the Large Bindweed or  Convolvulus. To look at it, however, we will go round into the garden  where there is more of it than Mrs. Hammond cares to see. It is  certainly a beautiful plant, with its large three-sided pointed leaves,  and its great pure white bell-shaped flowers--something like the mouth  of a trumpet.    In the farmhouse garden, however, it is certainly a weed--a plant in the  wrong place. We see that at once. Close to the hedge are some gooseberry  and currant bushes, and into these the Bindweed has climbed. The  Bindweed's stems are twined round the stems and branches of the bushes  till they are almost hidden by it, and are bent down by the weight.    [Illustration: LARGE BINDWEED.]    The Bindweed climbs, as we see, by twisting its stem round the tree to  which it clings; but though it is a climbing plant its stems can grow  for a foot or more from the ground without support. Some of the shoots  of the Bindweed are two or three feet away from the stems of the fruit  bushes, but they have grown unsupported till they could reach an  overhanging bough and cling to that.    Every now and then, Dan, who looks after the garden when he has time,  cuts oft all the Bindweed close to the ground, and pulls some of it up  by the roots; but fresh shoots soon appear again. It is of little use to  dig up the ground near the bushes, for the Bindweed is twisted all among  their roots.    You think the Bindweed and the Traveller's Joy beautiful flowers, and  so they are. At the same time these plants are far more troublesome and  dangerous weeds than the Stinging Nettle. Nearly all plants that cling  to other plants do harm; they prevent the stems and boughs to which they  cling from swelling freely. See how tightly the Bindweed stems are  twisted round the boughs of this currant bush. Ivy, Bindweed, and other  clinging plants often kill or seriously injure valuable trees in this  way.          CHAPTER V    CLOVER      I said all I could to make you admire the Nettle, and to see what a  handsome and even useful plant it is. I am afraid, however, that you do  not care much for it; I do not see that any of you have gathered a  handful to take home. When we go in to dinner presently, if"]]]
