In  the jungle of the city, here is the feeding place. Here come the growling  bipeds for such bones and messes as are thrown them.    The waiter thrusts a card beneath my nose. \"Nice leg of lamb, sir?\" I waved  him off. \"Hold a bit!\" I cried. \"You'll fetch me a capon in white broth as  my Lady Monmouth broileth hers. Put plentiful sack in it and boil it until  it simpreth!\" The waiter scratched his head. \"The chicken pie is good,\" he  said. \"It's our Wednesday dish.\" \"Varlet!\" I cried--then softened. \"Let it  be the chicken pie! But if the cook knoweth the manner that Lord Carlile  does mix and pepper it, let that manner be followed to the smallest  fraction of a pinch!\"            On Buying Old Books      By some slim chance, reader, you may be the kind of person who, on a visit  to a strange city, makes for a bookshop. Of course your slight temporal  business may detain you in the earlier hours of the day. You sit with  committees and stroke your profound chin, or you spend your talent in the  market, or run to and fro and wag your tongue in persuasion. Or, if you be  on a holiday, you strain yourself on the sights of the city, against being  caught in an omission. The bolder features of a cathedral must be grasped  to satisfy a quizzing neighbor lest he shame you later on your hearth, a  building must be stuffed inside your memory, or your pilgrim feet must wear  the pavement of an ancient shrine. However, these duties being done and the  afternoon having not yet declined, do you not seek a bookshop to regale  yourself?    Doubtless, we have met. As you have scrunched against the shelf not to  block the passage, but with your head thrown back to see the titles up  above, you have noticed at the corner of your eye--unless it was one of  your blinder moments when you were fixed wholly on the shelf--a man in  a slightly faded overcoat of mixed black and white, a man just past the  nimbleness of youth, whose head is plucked of its full commodity of hair.  It was myself. I admit the portrait, though modesty has curbed me short of  justice.    Doubtless, we have met. It was your umbrella--which you held villainously  beneath your arm--that took me in the ribs when you lighted on a set of  Fuller's Worthies. You recall my sour looks, but it was because I had  myself lingered on the volumes but cooled at the price. How you smoothed  and fingered them! With what triumph you bore them off! I bid you--for I  see you in a slippered state, eased and unbuttoned after dinner--I bid you  turn the pages with a slow thumb, not to miss the slightest tang of their  humor. You will of course go first, because of its broad fame, to the page  on Shakespeare and Ben Jonson and their wet-combats at the Mermaid. But  before the night is too far gone and while yet you can hold yourself from  nodding, you will please read about Captain John Smith of Virginia and his  \"strange performances, the scene whereof is laid at such a distance, they  are cheaper credited than confuted.\"    In no proper sense am I a buyer of old books. I admit a bookish quirk  maybe, a love of the shelf, a weakness for morocco, especially if it is  stained with age. I will, indeed, shirk a wedding for a bookshop. I'll  go in \"just to look about a bit, to see what the fellow has,\" and on an  occasion I pick up a volume. But I am innocent of first editions. It is  a stiff courtesy, as becomes a democrat, that I bestow on this form  of primogeniture. Of course, I have nosed my way with pleasure along  aristocratic shelves and flipped out volumes here and there to ask their  price, but for the greater part, it is the plainer shops that engage me. If  a rack of books is offered cheap before the door, with a fixed price upon a  card, I come at a trot. And if a brown dust lies on them, I bow and sniff  upon the rack, as though the past like an ancient fop in peruke and buckle  were giving me the courtesy of its snuff box. If I take the dust in my  nostrils and chance to sneeze, it is the fit and intended observance toward  the manners of a former century.    I have in mind such a bookshop in Bath, England. It presents to the street  no more than a decent front, but opens up behind like a swollen bottle.  There are twenty rooms at least, piled together with such confusion of  black passages and winding steps, that one might think that the owner  himself must hold a thread when he visits the remoter rooms. Indeed, such  are the obscurities and dim turnings of the place, that, were the legend of  the Minotaur but English, you might fancy that the creature still lived in  this labyrinth, to nip you between his toothless gums--for the beast grows  old--at some darker corner. There is a story of the place, that once a raw  clerk having been sent to rummage in the basement, his candle tipped off  the shelf. He was left in so complete darkness that his fears overcame his  judgment and for two hours he roamed and babbled among the barrels. Nor was  his absence discovered until the end of the day when, as was the custom,  the clerks counted noses at the door. When they found him, he bolted up the  steps, nor did he cease his whimper until he had reached the comforting  twilight of the outer world. He served thereafter in the shop a full two  years and had a beard coming--so the story runs--before he would again  venture beyond the third turning of the passage; to the stunting of his  scholarship, for the deeper books lay in the farther windings.    Or it may appear credible that in ages past a jealous builder contrived the  place. Having no learning himself and being at odds with those of better  opportunity, he twisted the pattern of the house. Such was his evil temper,  that he set the steps at a dangerous hazard in the dark, in order that  scholars--whose eyes are bleared at best--might risk their legs to the end  of time. Those of strict orthodoxy have even suspected the builder to have  been an atheist, for they have observed what double joints and steps and  turnings confuse the passage to the devouter books--the Early Fathers in  particular being up a winding stair where even the soberest reader might  break his neck. Be these things as they may, leather bindings in sets of  \"grenadier uniformity\" ornament the upper and lighter rooms. Biography  straggles down a hallway, with a candle needed at the farther end. A room  of dingy plays--Wycherley, Congreve and their crew--looks out through an  area grating. It was through even so foul an eye, that when alive, they  looked upon the world. As for theology, except for the before-mentioned  Fathers, it sits in general and dusty convention on the landing to the  basement, its snuffy sermons, by a sad misplacement--or is there an  ironical intention?--pointing the way to the eternal abyss below.    It was in this shop that I inquired whether there was published a book on  piracy in Cornwall. Now, I had lately come from Tintagel on the Cornish  coast, and as I had climbed upon the rocks and looked down upon the sea, I  had wondered to myself whether, if the knowledge were put out before me, I  could compose a story of Spanish treasure and pirates. For I am a prey to  such giddy ambition. A foul street--if the buildings slant and topple--will  set me thinking delightfully of murders. A wharf-end with water lapping  underneath and bits of rope about will set me itching for a deep-sea plot.  Or if I go on broader range and see in my fancy a broken castle on a hill,  I'll clear its moat and sound trumpets on its walls. If there is pepper  in my mood, I'll storm its dungeon. Or in a softer moment I'll trim its  unsubstantial towers with pageantry and rest upon my elbow until I fall  asleep. So being cast upon the rugged Cornish coast whose cliffs are so  swept with winter winds that the villages sit for comfort in the hollows,  it was to be expected that my thoughts would run toward pirates.    There is one rock especially which I had climbed in the rain and fog of  early morning. A reckless path goes across its face with a sharp pitch to  the ocean. It was so slippery and the wind so tugged and pulled to throw me  off, that although I endangered my dignity, I played the quadruped on the  narrower parts. But once on top in the open blast of the storm and safe  upon the level, I thumped with desire for a plot. In each inlet from the  ocean I saw a pirate lugger--such is the pleasing word--with a keg of rum  set up. Each cranny led to a cavern with doubloons piled inside. The  very tempest in my ears was compounded out of ships at sea and wreck and  pillage. I needed but a plot, a thread of action to string my villains on.  If this were once contrived, I would spice my text with sailors' oaths and  such boasting talk as might lie in my invention. Could I but come upon a  plot, I might yet proclaim myself an author.    With this guilty secret in me I blushed as I asked the question. It seemed  sure that the shopkeeper must guess my purpose. I felt myself suspected as  though I were a rascal buying pistols to commit a murder. Indeed, I seem  to remember having read that even hardened criminals have become confused  before a shopkeeper and betrayed themselves. Of course, Dick Turpin and  Jerry Abershaw could call for pistols in the same easy tone they ordered  ale, but it would take a practiced villainy. But I in my innocence wanted  nothing but the meager outline of a pirate's life, which I might fatten to  my uses.    But on a less occasion, when there is no plot thumping in me, I still feel  a kind of embarrassment when I ask for a book out of the general demand. I  feel so like an odd stick. This embarrassment applies not to the request  for other commodities. I will order a collar that is quite outside the  fashion, in a high-pitched voice so that the whole shop can hear. I could  bargain for a purple waistcoat--did my taste run so--and though the  sidewalk listened, it would not draw a blush. I have traded even for  women'"]]]
