First we ignite the grain. Nay, pile it on:      Where are thy wits flown, timorous Thestylis?      Shall I be flouted, I, by such as thou?      Pile, and still say, 'This pile is of his bones.'        _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.      Delphis racks me: I burn him in these bays.      As, flame-enkindled, they lift up their voice,      Blaze once, and not a trace is left behind:      So waste his flesh to powder in yon fire!        _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.      E'en as I melt, not uninspired, the wax,      May Mindian Delphis melt this hour with love:      And, swiftly as this brazen wheel whirls round,      May Aphrodite whirl him to my door.        _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.      Next burn the husks. Hell's adamantine floor      And aught that else stands firm can Artemis move.      Thestylis, the hounds bay up and down the town:      The goddess stands i' the crossroads: sound the gongs.        _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.      Hushed are the voices of the winds and seas;      But O not hushed the voice of my despair.      He burns my being up, who left me here      No wife, no maiden, in my misery.        _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.      Thrice I pour out; speak thrice, sweet mistress, thus:      \"What face soe'er hangs o'er him be forgot      Clean as, in Dia, Theseus (legends say)      Forgat his Ariadne's locks of love.\"        _Turn, magic, wheel, draw homeward him I love_.      The coltsfoot grows in Arcady, the weed      That drives the mountain-colts and swift mares wild.      Like them may Delphis rave: so, maniac-wise,      Race from his burnished brethren home to me.        _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.      He lost this tassel from his robe; which I      Shred thus, and cast it on the raging flames.      Ah baleful Love! why, like the marsh-born leech,      Cling to my flesh, and drain my dark veins dry?        _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.      From a crushed eft tomorrow he shall drink      Death! But now, Thestylis, take these herbs and smear      That threshold o'er, whereto at heart I cling      Still, still--albeit he thinks scorn of me--      And spit, and say, ''Tis Delphis' bones I smear.'        _Turn, magic wheel, draw homeward him I love_.                                                [_Exit Thestylis_.        Now, all alone, I'll weep a love whence sprung      When born? Who wrought my sorrow? Anaxo came,      Her basket in her hand, to Artemis' grove.      Bound for the festival, troops of forest beasts      Stood round, and in the midst a lioness.        _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.      Theucharidas' slave, my Thracian nurse now dead      Then my near neighbour, prayed me and implored      To see the pageant: I, the poor doomed thing,      Went with her, trailing a fine silken train,      And gathering round me Clearista's robe.        _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.      Now, the mid-highway reached by Lycon's farm,      Delphis and Eudamippus passed me by.      With beards as lustrous as the woodbine's gold      And breasts more sheeny than thyself, O Moon,      Fresh from the wrestler's glorious toil they came.        _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.      I saw, I raved, smit (weakling) to my heart.      My beauty withered, and I cared no more      For all that pomp; and how I gained my home      I know not: some strange fever wasted me.      Ten nights and days I lay upon my bed.        _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.      And wan became my flesh, as 't had been dyed,      And all my hair streamed off, and there was left      But bones and skin. Whose threshold crossed I not,      Or missed what grandam's hut who dealt in charms?      For no light thing was this, and time sped on.        _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.      At last I spake the truth to that my maid:      \"Seek, an thou canst, some cure for my sore pain.      Alas, I am all the Mindian's! But begone,      And watch by Timagetus' wrestling-school:      There doth he haunt, there soothly take his rest.        _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.      \"Find him alone: nod softly: say, 'she waits';      And bring him.\" So I spake: she went her way,      And brought the lustrous-limbed one to my roof.      And I, the instant I beheld him step      Lightfooted o'er the threshold of my door,        _(Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_,)      Became all cold like snow, and from my brow      Brake the damp dewdrops: utterance I had none,      Not e'en such utterance as a babe may make      That babbles to its mother in its dreams;      But all my fair frame stiffened into wax.        _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.      He bent his pitiless eyes on me; looked down,      And sate him on my couch, and sitting, said:      \"Thou hast gained on me, Simaetha, (e'en as I      Gained once on young Philinus in the race,)      Bidding me hither ere I came unasked.        _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.      \"For I had come, by Eros I had come,      This night, with comrades twain or may-be more,      The fruitage of the Wine-god in my robe,      And, wound about my brow with ribands red,      The silver leaves so dear to Heracles.        _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.      \"Had ye said 'Enter,' well: for 'mid my peers      High is my name for goodliness and speed:      I had kissed that sweet mouth once and gone my way.      But had the door been barred, and I thrust out,      With brand and axe would we have stormed ye then.        _Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.      \"Now be my thanks recorded, first to Love,      Next to thee, maiden, who didst pluck me out,      A half-burned helpless creature, from the flames,      And badst me hither. It is Love that lights      A fire more fierce than his of Lipara;        _(Bethink thee, mistress Moon, whence came my love_.)      \"Scares, mischief-mad, the maiden from her bower,      The bride from her warm couch.\" He spake: and I,      A willing listener, sat, my hand in his,      Among the cushions, and his cheek touched mine,      Each hotter than its wont, and we discoursed      In soft low language. Need I prate to thee,      Sweet Moon, of all we said and all we did?      Till yesterday he found no fault with me,      Nor I with him. But lo, to-day there came      Philista's mother--hers who flutes to me--      With her Melampo's; just when up the sky      Gallop the mares that chariot rose-limbed Dawn:      And divers tales she brought me, with the rest      How Delphis loved, she knew not rightly whom:      But this she knew; that of the rich wine, aye      He poured 'to Love;' and at the last had fled,      To line, she deemed, the fair one's hall with flowers.      Such was my visitor's tale, and it was true:      For thrice, nay four times, daily he would stroll      Hither, leave here full oft his Dorian flask:      Now--'tis a fortnight since I saw his face.      Doth he then treasure something sweet elsewhere?      Am I forgot? I'll charm him now with charms.      But let him try me more, and by the Fates      He'll soon be knocking at the gates of hell.      Spells of such power are in this chest of mine,      Learned, lady, from mine host in Palestine.          Lady, farewell: turn ocean-ward thy steeds:      As I have purposed, so shall I fulfil.      Farewell, thou bright-faced Moon! Ye stars, farewell,      That wait upon the car of noiseless Night.          IDYLL III.      The Serenade.        I pipe to Amaryllis; while my goats,      Tityrus their guardian, browse along the fell.      O Tityrus, as I love thee, feed my goats:      And lead them to the spring, and, Tityrus, 'ware      The lifted crest of yon gray Libyan ram.        Ah winsome Amaryllis! Why no more      Greet'st thou thy darling, from the caverned rock      Peeping all coyly? Think'st thou scorn of him?      Hath a near view revealed him satyr-shaped      Of chin and nostril? I shall hang me soon.      See here ten apples: from thy favourite tree      I plucked them: I shall bring ten more anon.      Ah witness my heart-anguish! Oh were I      A booming bee, to waft me to thy lair,      Threading the fern and ivy in whose depths      Thou nestlest! I have learned what Love is now:      Fell god, he drank the lioness's milk,      In the wild woods his mother cradled him,      Whose fire slow-burns me, smiting to the bone.      O thou whose glance is beauty and whose heart      All marble: O dark-eyebrowed maiden mine!      Cling to thy goatherd, let him kiss thy lips,      For there is sweetness in an empty kiss.      Thou wilt not? Piecemeal I will rend the crown,      The ivy-crown which, dear, I guard for thee,      Inwov'n with scented parsley and with flowers:      Oh I am desperate--what betides me, what?--      Still art thou deaf? I'll doff my coat of skins      And leap into yon waves, where on the watch      For mackerel Olpis sits: tho' I 'scape death,      That I have all but died will pleasure thee.      That learned I when (I murmuring 'loves she me?')      The _Love-in-absence_, crushed, returned no sound,      But shrank and shrivelled on my smooth young wrist.      I learned it of the sieve-divining crone      Who gleaned behind the reapers yesterday:      'Thou'rt wrapt up all,' Agraia said, 'in her;      She makes of none account her worshipper.'        Lo! a white goat, and twins, I keep for thee:      Mermnon's lass covets them: dark she is of skin:      But yet hers be they; thou but foolest me.

There are three entrances from Chancery-lane: that in the centre is  exclusively for members, and leads to all parts of the building; that on  the right for persons going to the Registry Office; and also for persons  having to speak to members; that on the left leads down to the Office for  the deposit of deeds, and to the strong rooms.    The second division consists of the _Hall_ and its appurtenances. It is  above thirty feet high, and fifty-seven feet and a half long; and on each  side it has wings or recesses, behind insulated columns of scagliola, in  imitation of Egyptian granite. Within these, and at the back of the  columns, are galleries; the staircases to which are concealed in the  angles. There are three fireplaces in the Hall; one in the centre,  opposite the principal entrance, and one in the centre of each of the  recesses. The Hall is lighted by a lantern-light forty feet long and  twenty-four feet wide.    The third division is next Bell-yard: it is subdivided into two parts. In  the first of these are three entrances from Bell-yard. That in the centre  is exclusively for the members; that to the left leads to the staircase to  the Secretary's apartments; and the other, to the right of the centre, is  for strangers to enter who have business to transact in any of the rooms  appropriated to public business. On the ground floor of this part of the  third division is a large Committee Room, and an ante or waiting room  adjoining, and the great staircase to the rooms above. On the first floor  are the rooms for meetings on matters of business connected with the law;  and above these are the Secretary's apartments.    The second part of the third division contains, on the ground floor, the  _Club Room_, which occupies all the ground floor: it will be divided by  columns and pilasters of scagliola, and decorated with a paneled ceiling  and appropriate ornaments. Its dimensions are fifty feet by twenty-seven,  and eighteen feet high. On the first floor are rooms of different  dimensions for dinner parties; and over these, rooms for the resident  officers. In the basement story of this part of the building are the  Kitchen and other domestic offices for the use of the Club.    The office for the deposit of deeds is in the basement story, next to  Chancery-lane.    In the remaining parts of the basement story of the building are fifty-two  strong rooms, with iron doors, for the deposit of deeds, which are well  ventilated and fire-proof; their average size is six feet and a half by  seven feet and a half, but some are larger, and others rather less, than  these dimensions. The whole are secured by one double iron door, with a  very strong lock and master-key.          [1] In our last we erroneously stated the whole of this building as          the work of Messrs. Lee, for L9,214.; only part of the carcase,          containing the Hall, Library, &c. being contracted for by those          builders for the above sum. Other contracts have since been made          for the completion of the building; of these, the principal is          with Messrs. Baker and Son (the builders of the King's library          and new galleries of the British Museum, &c.) who have executed          the beautiful finishings of the interior: these contracts amount          to upwards of L12,000.            Other contracts have been made with the above parties for the          erection of the Club House, and Dining Rooms, &c., situate in          Bell Yard, which is an addition subsequently made to the original          building.        [2] The best remains of Ionic buildings at Athens are the temples of          Erecthens and Minerva Pulias in the Acropolis, and the little          temple on the banks of the Ilissus; but in Asia Minor the examples          of this order are far more numerous; and some of the finest are to          be found amongst the magnificent ruins at Brauchidia, at Priene,          and at Teos, &c.           *       *       *       *       *          SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY           *       *       *       *       *      VAPOUR-BATHS.      Among the remedies for cholera, or perhaps we should rather say attempted  remedies, the vapour-bath is conspicuous over all the other means of cure,  external and internal: stimulants, frictions, rubefacients, blisters, have  that for their indirect object which the vapour-bath accomplishes directly,  namely, to produce heat on the surface of the body, and thus restore that  correspondence between the temperature of the interior and exterior parts,  which in the disease is so strangely disturbed. There are two difficulties  in the application of the vapour-bath, which are not easily overcome. When  applied to the patient in the ordinary way, from the nature of the heat,  the upper surface of the body is scorched, while the back is almost cold.  Now in cholera, the application of heat to the back is of essential  importance. In the whole of the machines for applying the bath, the  patient is exposed to more or less tossing about; which, from the extreme  prostration of strength in cholera patients, is always injurious; and as  the patient must, when taken from the bath, be replaced on a comparatively  cold bed, the sudden change will often do more ill than the bath will do  good. To these must be added, in a disease which chiefly affects the poor,  another item, forming an important drawback on the utility of the ordinary  vapour-bath,--the application of it is attended with no inconsiderable  expense. A machine which should obviate these objections, was a  desideratum; and we think such a one has been invented by Mr. Burnet, of  Golden Square. It is so simple as to be easily described without a diagram,  and so well adapted to the end, and so easy and cheap in application, that  we think we shall be rendering an acceptable service to our readers in  describing it. The best way to effect this is to show the steps of its  application.    We suppose the patient lying on his back in bed. The two sides of a  framework, about 6-1/2 by 2-1/2 feet, are placed one on each side of him;  five or six broad canvass straps, which are meant to support his body, are  placed beneath him by a couple of attendants; two transverse pieces of  wood are then introduced at the foot and head, to extend the framework;  and the cross straps, by means of eyelet-holes, are attached to the sides,  by a row of common brass pins. This is the work of about a minute. One  attendant then raises the frame at the head, while the other introduces a  couple of feet about nine inches long into the frame; and this done, the  foot is raised in a similar way, and similarly supported; a board is then  fitted to the foot, through a hole in the centre of which the chimney of  the heating apparatus passes; the blankets are closely tucked round the  patient and the frame; the lamp is applied, and the process of bathing  commences. In this way, it will be seen that the patient is suspended in  the heated air, which is moreover applied to the back in the first  instance; there is no fatigue incurred; and when perspiration has been  generated and carried on as long as is deemed expedient, he is let down  again, without difficulty or danger, into his heated bed, and surrounded  with the warm blankets employed in the bath itself. The room in which we  saw the experiment performed, was at a temperature of 43 deg. Fahrenheit; the  clothes of the bed were of the same temperature: the lamp is conical, and  has no tube; the wick is merely inserted in it; the charge is two ounces  of spirits of wine. In ten minutes after the lamp had been applied, the  thermometer at the foot of the frame on which the patient is made to  recline, was 136 deg.; at the head, 116 deg.; on the blanket, which covered the  bed, 96 deg.. Were the vapour applied above the patient instead of under him,  the difference between the heat at the breast and back would be at least  40 deg.. The temperature once raised, may be kept up at a very small expense;  so that the whole price of the bath, continued for half an hour or three  quarters of an hour, will not exceed eightpence or ninepence. There is a  very simple expedient, by which, when the temperature of the chamber  formed by the frame of the bath is once raised sufficiently high, steam,  either simple or medicated, may be introduced, and the lamp apparatus may  be applied either at the foot, the head, or the side, as is most  convenient. The grand recommendation, however, of the bath, is the  applicability of the vapour to the entire surface of the body; the  simplicity and ease of the application, both to the assistants and the  patient; the exclusion of the possibility of cold; and its cheapness. In  all these points of view, we look on it as a valuable invention.    _Spectator_.           *       *       *       *       *          NOTES OF A READER           *       *       *       *       *      DECLINE OF THE DRAMA.      One thing which I am unable to interpret among the oddities of the English,  is their inconsistency respecting dramatic entertainments. I have never  yet been present where two or three of my countrymen were gathered  together, that, after a wrangling review of the weather, they did not turn  their conversation upon the theatres. There is no topic more universally  discussed than the decadence of the drama, or the engagements, merits,  and adventures of the performers. Neither the Lord Chancellor nor the  Archbishop of Canterbury is ever so familiarly known by name and person  to the public, as the first tragedian and comedian of the day; and the  theatrical belles and heroines are"]]]
