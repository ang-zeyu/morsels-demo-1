Being a young man, Powell did not know at this time of his life, that  red is the fairy color, and that these were all dogs from Fairyland.  So he drove off the red-eared hounds, and was about to let loose his  own pack on the stag, when a horseman appeared on the scene.    The stranger at once began to upbraid Powell for being impolite. He  asked why his hounds should not be allowed to hunt the deer.    Powell spoke pleasantly in reply, making his proper excuses to the  horseman. The two began to like each other, and soon got acquainted  and mutually enjoyed being companions.    It turned out that the stranger was Arawn, a king in Fairyland. He had  a rival named Hargan, who was beating him and his army in war.    So Arawn asked Powell to help him against his enemy. He even made  request that one year from that time, Powell should meet Hargan in  battle. He told him that one stroke of his sword would finish the  enemy. He must then sheathe his weapon, and not, on any account,  strike a second time.    To make victory sure, the Fairy King would exchange shapes with the  mortal ruler and each take not only the place, but each the shape and  form of the other. Powell must go into Fairy Land and govern the  kingdom there, while Arawn should take charge of affairs at Dyfed.    But Powell was warned, again, to smite down his enemy with a single  stroke of his sword. If, in the heat of the conflict, and the joy of  victory, Powell should forget, and give a second blow to Hargan, he  would immediately come to life and be as strong as ever.    Powell heeded well these words. Then, putting on the shape of Arawn,  he went into Fairy Land, and no one noticed, or thought of anything  different from the days and years gone by.    But now, at night, a new and unexpected difficulty arose. Arawn's  beautiful wife was evidently not in the secret, for she greeted Powell  as her own husband.    After dinner, when the telling of stories in the banqueting hall was  over, the time had come for them to retire.    But the new bed fellow did not even kiss her, or say \"good night,\" but  turned his back to her and his face to the wall, and never moved until  daylight. Then the new King in Fairy Land rose up, ate his breakfast,  and went out to hunt.    Every day, he ruled the castle and kingdom, as if he had always been  the monarch. To everybody, he seemed as if he had been long used to  public business, and no questions were asked, nor was there any talk  made on the subject. Everyone took things as matter of course.    Yet, however polite or gracious he might be to the queen during the  day, in the evening, he spoke not a word, and passed every night as at  the first.    The twelve months soon sped along, and now the time for the battle in  single combat between Powell and Hargan had fully come. The two  warriors met in the middle of a river ford, and backed their horses  for a charge. Then they rushed furiously at the other. Powell's spear  struck Hargan so hard, that he was knocked out of the saddle and  hurled, the length of a lance, over and beyond the crupper, or tail  strap of his horse. He fell mortally wounded upon the ground.    Now came the moment of danger and temptation to Powell, for Hargan  cried out:    \"For the love of Heaven, finish your work on me. Slay me with your  sword.\"    But Powell was wise and his head was cool. He had kept in mind the  warning to strike only one blow. He called out loudly, so that all  could hear him:    \"I will not repeat that. Slay thee who may, I shall not.\"    So Hargan, knowing his end had come, bade his nobles bear him away  from the river shore.    Then Powell, with his armies, overran the two kingdoms of Fairy Land  and made himself master of all. He took oath of all the princes and  nobles, who swore to be loyal to their new master.    This done, Powell rode away to the trysting place in a glen, and there  he met Arawn, as had been appointed. They changed shapes, and each  became himself, as he had been before.    Arawn thanked Powell heartily, and bade him see what he had done for  him.    Then each one rode back, in his former likeness, to his kingdom.    Now at Anwyn, no one but Arawn himself knew that anything unusual had  taken place. After dinner, and the evening story telling were over,  and it was time to go to bed, Arawn's wife was surprised in double  measure.    Two things puzzled her. Her husband was now very tender to her and  also very talkative; whereas, for a whole year, every night, he had  been as silent and immovable as a log. How could it be, in either  case?    But this time, the wife was silent as a statue. Even though Arawn  spoke to her three times, he received no reply.    Then he asked directly of her, why she was so silent. She made an  answer that, for a whole year, no word had been spoken in their  bedroom.    \"What?\" said he, \"did we not talk together, as always before?\"    \"No,\" said she, \"not for a year has there been talk or caress between  us.\"    At this answer, Arawn was overcome with surprise, and as struck with  admiration at having so good a friend. He burst out first in praise of  Powell, and then told his wife all that had happened during the past  twelve months. She, too, was full of admiration, and told her husband  that in Powell he had certainly found a true friend.    In Dyfed, when Powell had returned to his own land and castle, he  called his lords together. Then he asked them to be perfectly frank  and free to speak. They must tell him whether they thought him a good  king during the year past.    All shouted in chorus of approval. Then their spokesman addressed  Powell thus:    \"My lord, never was thy wisdom so great, thy generosity more free, nor  thy justice more manifest, than during the past year.\"    When he ceased, all the vassals showed their approval of this speech.    Then Powell, smiling, told the story of his adventures in exchanging  his form and tasks; at the end of which, the spokesman taking his cue  from the happy faces of all his fellow vassals, made reply:    \"Of a truth, lord, we pray thee, do thou give thanks to Heaven that  thou hast formed such a fellowship. Please continue to us the form of  the kingdom and rule, that we have enjoyed for a year past.\"    Thereupon King Powell took oath, kissing the hilt of his sword, and  called on Heaven to witness his promise that he would do as they had  desired.    So the two kings confirmed the friendship they had made. Each sent the  other rich gifts of jewels, horses and hounds.    In memory of so wonderful and happy union, of a mortal and a fairy,  Powell was thereafter, in addition to all his titles, saluted as Lord  of Anwyn, which is only another name for the Land of the Fairies.          XX      POWELL AND HIS BRIDE      Not far from the castle where King Powell had his court, there was a  hillock called the Mount of Macbeth. It was the common belief that  some strange adventure would befall anyone who should sit upon that  mound.    He would receive blows, or wounds, or else he would see something  wonderful.    Thus it came to pass, that none but peaceful bards had ever sat upon  the mound. Never a warrior or a common man had risked sitting there.  The general fear felt, and the awe inspired by the place, was too  great.    But after his adventure of being King of Fairy Land for a whole year,  everything else to Powell seemed dull and commonplace. So, to test his  own courage, and worthiness of kingship, Powell assembled all his  lords at Narberth.    After the night's feasting, revelry and story telling, Powell declared  that, next day, he would sit upon the enchanted mound.    So when the sun was fully risen, Powell took his seat upon the mound,  expecting that, all of a sudden, something unusual would happen.    For some minutes nothing, whether event or vision, took place. Then he  lifted up his eyes and saw approaching him a white horse on which rode  a lady. She was dressed in shining garments, as if made of gold.  Evidently she was a princess. Yet she came not very near.    \"Does anyone among you know who this lady is?\" asked Powell of his  chieftains.    \"Not one of us,\" was the answer.    Thereupon Powell ordered his vassals to ride forward. They were to  greet her courteously, and inquire who she was.    But now the predicted wonder took place. She moved away from them, yet  at a quiet pace that suited her. Though the knights spurred their  horses, and rode fast and furiously, they could not come any nearer to  her.    They galloped back, and reported their failure to reach the lady.    Then Powell picked out others and sent them riding after the lady, but  each time, one and all returned, chagrined with failure. A woman had  beaten them.    So the day closed with silence in the castle hall. There was no merry  making or story telling that night.    The next day, Powell sat again on the mound and once more the golden  lady came near.    This time, Powell himself left his seat on the mound, leaped on his  fleetest horse, and pursued the maiden, robed in gold, on the white  horse.    But she flitted away, as she had done before from the knights. Again  and again, though he could get nearer and nearer to her, he failed.    Then the baffled king cried out, in despair, \"O maiden fair, for the  sake of him whom thou lovest, stay for me.\"    Evidently the lady, who lived in the time of castles and courts, did  not care to be wooed in the style of the cave men. Such manners did  not suit her, but with a change of method of making love, her heart  melted. Besides, she was a kind woman. She took pity on horses, as  well as on men.    Sweet was her voice, as she answered most graciously:    \"I will stay gladly, and it were better for thy horses, hadst thou  asked me properly, long ago.\"    To his questions, as to how and why she came to him, she told her  story, as follows:    \"I am Rhiannon, descended from the August and Venerable One "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9380"],[0,"A Nonsense Anthology (#20)"],[1,"-clap we to the close--    For what's the good of law in such a case o' the kind    Is mine to all intents and purposes.    This settled, I resume the thread o' the tale.      Now for a touch o' the vendor's quality.    He says a gen'lman bought a pebble of him,    (This pebble i' sooth, sir, which I hold i' my hand)--    And paid for 't, _like_ a gen'lman, on the nail.    \"Did I o'ercharge him a ha'penny?

LOVERS AND A  REFLECTION      In moss-prankt dells which the sunbeams flatter        (And heaven it knoweth what that may mean;    Meaning, however, is no great matter)        Where woods are a-tremble with words a-tween;      Thro' God's own heather we wonned together,        I and my Willie (O love my love):    I need hardly remark it was glorious weather,        And flitter-bats wavered alow, above:      Boats were curtseying, rising, bowing,        (Boats in that climate are so polite,)    And sands were a ribbon of green endowing,        And O the sun-dazzle on bark and bight!      Thro' the rare red heather we danced together        (O love my Willie,) and smelt for flowers:    I must mention again it was glorious weather,        Rhymes are so scarce in this world of ours:      By rises that flushed with their purple favors,        Thro' becks that brattled o'er grasses sheen,    We walked or waded, we two young shavers,        Thanking our stars we were both so green.      We journeyed in parallels, I and Willie,        In fortunate parallels! Butterflies,    Hid in weltering shadows of daffodilly        Or marjoram, kept making peacock eyes:      Song-birds darted about, some inky        As coal, some snowy (I ween) as curds;    Or rosy as pinks, or as roses pinky--        They reek of no eerie To-come, those birds!      But they skim over bents which the mill-stream washes,        Or hang in the lift 'neath a white cloud's hem;    They need no parasols, no goloshes;        And good Mrs. Trimmer she feedeth them.

O if billows and pillows and hours and flowers,        And all the brave rhymes of an elder day,    Could be furled together, this genial weather,        And carted or carried on wafts away,      Nor ever again trotted out--ah me!    How much fewer volumes of verse there'd be.                              _C.S. Calverley_          AN IMITATION OF WORDSWORTH      There is a river clear and fair,    'Tis neither broad nor narrow;          It winds a little here and there--    It winds about like any hare;    And then it takes as straight a course    As on the turnpike road a horse,        Or through the air an arrow.      The trees that grow upon the shore,    Have grown a hundred years or more;          So long there is no knowing.    Old Daniel Dobson does not know    When first these trees began to grow;    But still they grew, and grew, and grew,    As if they'd nothing else to do,        But ever to be growing.      The impulses of air and sky    Have rear'd their stately heads so high,        And clothed their boughs with green;    Their leaves the dews of evening quaff,--        And when the wind blows loud and keen,    I've seen the jolly timbers laugh,        And shake their sides with merry glee--        Wagging their heads in mockery.          Fix'd are their feet in solid earth,        Where winds can never blow;    But visitings of deeper birth        Have reach'd their roots below.    For they have gain'd the river's brink,    And of the living waters drink.      There's little Will, a five years child--        He is my youngest boy:    To look on eyes so fair and wild,        It is a very joy:--    He hath conversed with sun and shower,    And dwelt with every idle flower,        As fresh and gay as them.    He loiters with the briar rose,--    The blue-belles are his play-fellows,        That dance upon their slender stem.      And I have said, my little Will,    Why should not he continue still        A thing of Nature's rearing?    A thing beyond the world's control--    A living vegetable soul,--        No human sorrow fearing.      It were a blessed sight to see    That child become a Willow-tree,        His brother trees among.    He'd be four times as tall as me,        And live three times as long.                              _Catharine M. Fanshawe_.          THE FAMOUS BALLAD OF THE JUBILEE CUP      You may lift me up in your arms, lad, and turn my face to the sun,    For a last look back at the dear old track where the Jubilee cup         was won;    And draw your chair to my side, lad--no, thank ye, I feel no pain--    For I'm going out with the tide, lad; but I'll tell you the tale         again.      I'm  seventy-nine or nearly, and my head it has long turned gray,    But it all comes back as clearly as though it was yesterday--    The dust, and the bookies shouting around the clerk of the scales,    And the clerk of the course, and the nobs in force, and 'Is         'Ighness the Pr**ce of W*les.      'Twas a nine-hole thresh to wind'ard (but none of us cared for that),    With a straight run home to the service tee, and a finish along         the flat,    \"Stiff?\" ah, well you may say it! Spot barred, and at five stone         ten!    But at two and a bisque I'd ha' run the risk; for I was a         greenhorn then.      So we stripped to the B. Race signal, the old red swallowtail--    There was young Ben Bolt and the Portland Colt, and Aston Villa,         and Yale;    And W. G., and Steinitz, Leander and The Saint,    And the G*rm*n Emp*r*r's Meteor, a-looking as fresh as paint;      John Roberts (scratch), and Safety Match, The Lascar, and Lorna         Doone,    Oom Paul (a bye), and Romany Rye, and me upon Wooden Spoon;    And some of us cut for partners, and some of us strung for baulk,    And some of us tossed for stations--But there, what use to talk?      Three-quarter-back on the Kingsclere crack was station enough for         me,    With a fresh jackyarder blowing and the Vicarage goal a-lee!    And I leaned and patted her centre-bit and eased the quid in her         cheek,    With a \"Soh my lass!\" and a \"Woa you brute!\"--for she could do all         but speak.      She was geared a thought too high perhaps; she was trained a         trifle fine;    But she had the grand reach forward! I never saw such a line!    Smooth-bored, clean run, from her fiddle head with its dainty ear         half-cock,    Hard-bit, _pur sang_, from her overhang to the heel of her off         hind sock.      Sir Robert he walked beside me as I worked her down to the mark;    \"There's money on this, my lad,\" said he, \"and most of 'em's         running dark;    But ease the sheet if you're bunkered, and pack the scrummages         tight,    And use your slide at the distance, and we'll drink to your health         to-night!\"      But I bent and tightened my stretcher."]]]
