Kotsuke no Suke in  eager delight sent for the councillor into an inner chamber, and,  after thanking him, promised on the morrow to instruct his master  carefully in all the different points of etiquette. So the councillor,  seeing the miser's glee, rejoiced at the success of his plan; and  having taken his leave returned home in high spirits. But Kamei Sama,  little thinking how his vassal had propitiated his enemy, lay brooding  over his vengeance, and on the following morning at daybreak went to  Court in solemn procession.    When Kotsuke no Suke met him his manner had completely changed, and  nothing could exceed his courtesy. \"You have come early to Court this  morning, my Lord Kamei,\" said he. \"I cannot sufficiently admire your  zeal. I shall have the honour to call your attention to several points  of etiquette to-day. I must beg your lordship to excuse my previous  conduct, which must have seemed very rude; but I am naturally of a  cross-grained disposition, so I pray you to forgive me.\" And as he  kept on humbling himself and making fair speeches, the heart of Kamei  Sama was gradually softened, and he renounced his intention of killing  him. Thus by the cleverness of his councillor was Kamei Sama, with all  his house, saved from ruin.    Shortly after this, Takumi no Kami, who had sent no present, arrived  at the castle, and Kotsuke no Suke turned him into ridicule even more  than before, provoking him with sneers and covert insults; but Takumi  no Kami affected to ignore all this, and submitted himself patiently  to Kotsuke no Suke's orders.    This conduct, so far from producing a good effect, only made Kotsuke  no Suke despise him the more, until at last he said haughtily: \"Here,  my Lord of Takumi, the ribbon of my sock has come untied; be so good  as to tie it up for me.\"    Takumi no Kami, although burning with rage at the affront, still  thought that as he was on duty he was bound to obey, and tied up the  ribbon of the sock. Then Kotsuke no Suke, turning from him, petulantly  exclaimed: \"Why, how clumsy you are! You cannot so much as tie up the  ribbon of a sock properly! Any one can see that you are a boor from  the country, and know nothing of the manners of Yedo.\" And with a  scornful laugh he moved towards an inner room.    But the patience of Takumi no Kami was exhausted; this last insult was  more than he could bear.    \"Stop a moment, my lord,\" cried he.    \"Well, what is it?\" replied the other. And, as he turned round, Takumi  no Kami drew his dirk, and aimed a blow at his head; but Kotsuke no  Suke, being protected by the Court cap which he wore, the wound was  but a scratch, so he ran away; and Takumi no Kami, pursuing him, tried  a second time to cut him down, but, missing his aim, struck his dirk  into a pillar. At this moment an officer, named Kajikawa Yosobei,  seeing the affray, rushed up, and holding back the infuriated noble,  gave Kotsuke no Suke time to make good his escape.    Then there arose a great uproar and confusion, and Takumi no Kami was  arrested and disarmed, and confined in one of the apartments of the  palace under the care of the censors. A council was held, and the  prisoner was given over to the safeguard of a daimio, called Tamura  Ukiyo no Daibu, who kept him in close custody in his own house, to  the great grief of his wife and of his retainers; and when the  deliberations of the council were completed, it was decided that, as  he had committed an outrage and attacked another man within the  precincts of the palace, he must perform _hara-kiri_,--that is, commit  suicide by disembowelling; his goods must be confiscated, and his  family ruined. Such was the law. So Takumi no Kami performed  _hara-kiri_, his castle of Ako was confiscated, and his retainers  having become Ronins, some of them took service with other daimios,  and others became merchants.    Now amongst these retainers was his principal councillor, a man called  Oishi Kuranosuke, who, with forty-six other faithful dependants,  formed a league to avenge their master's death by killing Kotsuke no  Suke. This Oishi Kuranosuke was absent at the castle of Ako at the  time of the affray, which, had he been with his prince, would never  have occurred; for, being a wise man, he would not have failed to  propitiate Kotsuke no Suke by sending him suitable presents; while the  councillor who was in attendance on the prince at Yedo was a dullard,  who neglected this precaution, and so caused the death of his master  and the ruin of his house.    So Oishi Kuranosuke and his forty-six companions began to lay their  plans of vengeance against Kotsuke no Suke; but the latter was so well  guarded by a body of men lent to him by a daimio called Uyesugi Sama,  whose daughter he had married, that they saw that the only way of  attaining their end would be to throw their enemy off his guard. With  this object they separated and disguised themselves, some as  carpenters or craftsmen, others as merchants; and their chief,  Kuranosuke, went to Kioto, and built a house in the quarter called  Yamashina, where he took to frequenting houses of the worst repute,  and gave himself up to drunkenness and debauchery, as if nothing were  further from his mind than revenge. Kotsuke no Suke, in the meanwhile,  suspecting that Takumi no Kami's former retainers would be scheming  against his life, secretly sent spies to Kioto, and caused a faithful  account to be kept of all that Kuranosuke did. The latter, however,  determined thoroughly to delude the enemy into a false security, went  on leading a dissolute life with harlots and winebibbers. One day, as  he was returning home drunk from some low haunt, he fell down in the  street and went to sleep, and all the passers-by laughed him to scorn.  It happened that a Satsuma man saw this, and said: \"Is not this Oishi  Kuranosuke, who was a councillor of Asano Takumi no Kami, and who, not  having the heart to avenge his lord, gives himself up to women and  wine? See how he lies drunk in the public street! Faithless beast!  Fool and craven! Unworthy the name of a Samurai!\"[5]    [Footnote 5: _Samurai_, a man belonging to the _Buke_ or military  class, entitled to bear arms.]    [Illustration: THE SATSUMA MAN INSULTS OISHI KURANOSUKE.]    And he trod on Kuranosuke's face as he slept, and spat upon him; but  when Kotsuke no Suke's spies reported all this at Yedo, he was greatly  relieved at the news, and felt secure from danger.    One day Kuranosuke's wife, who was bitterly grieved to see her husband  lead this abandoned life, went to him and said: \"My lord, you told me  at first that your debauchery was but a trick to make your enemy relax  in watchfulness. But indeed, indeed, this has gone too far. I pray and  beseech you to put some restraint upon yourself.\"    \"Trouble me not,\" replied Kuranosuke, \"for I will not listen to your  whining. Since my way of life is displeasing to you, I will divorce  you, and you may go about your business; and I will buy some pretty  young girl from one of the public-houses, and marry her for my  pleasure. I am sick of the sight of an old woman like you about the  house, so get you gone--the sooner the better.\"    So saying, he flew into a violent rage, and his wife, terror-stricken,  pleaded piteously for mercy.    \"Oh, my lord! unsay those terrible words! I have been your faithful  wife for twenty years, and have borne you three children; in sickness  and in sorrow I have been with you; you cannot be so cruel as to turn  me out of doors now. Have pity! have pity!\"    \"Cease this useless wailing. My mind is made up, and you must go; and  as the children are in my way also, you are welcome to take them with  you.\"    When she heard her husband speak thus, in her grief she sought her  eldest son, Oishi Chikara, and begged him to plead for her, and pray  that she might be pardoned. But nothing would turn Kuranosuke from his  purpose, so his wife was sent away, with the two younger children, and  went back to her native place. But Oishi Chikara remained with his  father.    The spies communicated all this without fail to Kotsuke no Suke, and  he, when he heard how Kuranosuke, having turned his wife and children  out of doors and bought a concubine, was grovelling in a life of  drunkenness and lust, began to think that he had no longer anything to  fear from the retainers of Takumi no Kami, who must be cowards,  without the courage to avenge their lord. So by degrees he began to  keep a less strict watch, and sent back half of the guard which had  been lent to him by his father-in-law, Uyesugi Sama. Little did he  think how he was falling into the trap laid for him by Kuranosuke,  who, in his zeal to slay his lord's enemy, thought nothing of  divorcing his wife and sending away his children! Admirable and  faithful man!    In this way Kuranosuke continued to throw dust in the eyes of his foe,  by persisting in his apparently shameless conduct; but his associates  all went to Yedo, and, having in their several capacities as workmen  and pedlars contrived to gain access to Kotsuke no Suke's house, made  themselves familiar with the plan of the building and the arrangement  of the different rooms, and ascertained the character of the inmates,  who were brave and loyal men, and who were cowards; upon all of which  matters they sent regular reports to Kuranosuke. And when at last it  became evident from the letters which arrived from Yedo that Kotsuke  no Suke was thoroughly off his guard, Kuranosuke rejoiced that the day  of vengeance was at hand; and, having appointed a trysting-place at  Yedo, he fled secretly from Kioto, eluding the vigilance of his  enemy's spies. Then the forty-seven men, having laid all their plans,  bided their time patiently.    It was now"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1302"],[0,"The Enemies of Books (#3)"],[1," they were committed. D'Israeli narrates that, about the year  1700, Heer Hudde, an opulent burgomaster of Middleburgh, travelled for  30 years disguised as a mandarin, throughout the length and breadth of  the Celestial Empire. Everywhere he collected books, and his extensive  literary treasures were at length safely shipped for transmission to  Europe, but, to the irreparable loss of his native country, they never  reached their destination, the vessel having foundered in a storm.    In 1785 died the famous Maffei Pinelli, whose library was celebrated  throughout the world. It had been collected by the Pinelli family for  many generations and comprised an extraordinary number of Greek, Latin,  and Italian works, many of them first editions, beautifully illuminated,  together with numerous MSS. dating from the 11th to the 16th century.  The whole library was sold by the Executors to Mr. Edwards, bookseller,  of Pall Mall, who placed the volumes in three vessels for transport from  Venice to London. Pursued by Corsairs, one of the vessels was captured,  but the pirate, disgusted at not finding any treasure, threw all the  books into the sea. The other two vessels escaped and delivered  their freight safely, and in 1789-90 the books which had been so near  destruction were sold at the great room in Conduit Street, for more than  L9,000.    These pirates were more excusable than Mohammed II who, upon the capture  of Constantinople in the 15th century, after giving up the devoted city  to be sacked by his licentious soldiers, ordered the books in all  the churches as well as the great library of the Emperor Constantine,  containing 120,000 Manuscripts, to be thrown into the sea.    In the shape of rain, water has frequently caused irreparable injury.  Positive wet is fortunately of rare occurrence in a library, but is very  destructive when it does come, and, if long continued, the substance of  the paper succumbs to the unhealthy influence and rots and rots until  all fibre disappears, and the paper is reduced to a white decay which  crumbles into powder when handled.    Few old libraries in England are now so thoroughly neglected as they  were thirty years ago. The state of many of our Collegiate and Cathedral  libraries was at that time simply appalling. I could mention many  instances, one especially, where a window having been left broken for  a long time, the ivy had pushed through and crept over a row of books,  each of which was worth hundreds of pounds. In rainy weather the water  was conducted, as by a pipe, along the tops of the books and soaked  through the whole.    In another and smaller collection, the rain came straight on to a  book-case through a sky-light, saturating continually the top shelf  containing Caxtons and other early English books, one of which, although  rotten, was sold soon after by permission of the Charity Commissioners  for L200.    Germany, too, the very birth-place of Printing, allows similar  destruction to go on unchecked, if the following letter, which appeared  about a Year ago (1879) in the _Academy_ has any truth in it:--      \"For some time past the condition of the library at Wolfenbuttel has  been most disgraceful. The building is in so unsafe a condition  that portions of the walls and ceilings have fallen in, and the many  treasures in Books and MSS. contained in it are exposed to damp and  decay. An appeal has been issued that this valuable collection may not  be allowed to perish for want of funds, and that it may also be now at  length removed to Brunswick, since Wolfenbuttel is entirely deserted as  an intellectual centre. No false sentimentality regarding the memory of  its former custodians, Leibnitz and Lessing, should hinder this project.  Lessing himself would have been the first to urge that the library and  its utility should be considered above all things.\"      The collection of books at Wolfenbuttel is simply magnificent, and I  cannot but hope the above report was exaggerated. Were these books to  be injured for the want of a small sum spent on the roof, it would be a  lasting disgrace to the nation. There are so many genuine book-lovers  in Fatherland that the commission of such a crime would seem incredible,  did not bibliographical history teem with similar desecrations.[1]      [1] This was written in 1879, since which time a new building has been  erected.      Water in the form of vapour is a great enemy of books, the damp  attacking both outside and inside. Outside it fosters the growth of a  white mould or fungus which vegetates upon the edges of the leaves, upon  the sides and in the joints of the binding. It is easily wiped off, but  not without leaving a plain mark, where the mould-spots have been. Under  the microscope a mould-spot is seen to be a miniature forest of lovely  trees, covered with a beautiful white foliage, upas trees whose roots  are embedded in the leather and destroy its texture.    Inside the book, damp encourages the growth of those ugly brown spots  which so often disfigure prints and \"livres de luxe.\" Especially  it attacks books printed in the early part of this century, when  paper-makers had just discovered that they could bleach their rags,  and perfectly white paper, well pressed after printing, had become the  fashion. This paper from the inefficient means used to neutralise the  bleach, carried the seeds of decay in itself, and when exposed to any  damp soon became discoloured with brown stains. Dr. Dibdin's extravagant  bibliographical works are mostly so injured; and although the Doctor's  bibliography is very incorrect, and his spun-out inanities and  wearisome affectations often annoy one, yet his books are so beautifully  illustrated, and he is so full of personal anecdote and chit chat, that  it grieves the heart to see \"foxey\" stains common in his most superb  works.    In a perfectly dry and warm library these spots would probably remain  undeveloped, but many endowed as well as private libraries are not in  daily use, and are often injured from a false idea that a hard frost and  prolonged cold do no injury to a library so long as the weather is dry.  The fact is that books should never be allowed to get really cold, for  when a thaw comes and the weather sets in warm, the air, laden with  damp, penetrates the inmost recesses, and working its way between the  volumes and even between the leaves, deposits upon their cold surface  its moisture. The best preventative of this is a warm atmosphere during  the frost, sudden heating when the frost has gone being useless.    Our worst enemies are sometimes our real friends, and perhaps the best  way of keeping libraries entirely free from damp is to circulate our  enemy in the shape of hot water through pipes laid under the floor. The  facilities now offered for heating such pipes from the outside are so  great, the expense comparatively so small, and the direct gain in the  expulsion of damp so decided, that where it can be accomplished without  much trouble it is well worth the doing.    At the same time no system of heating should be allowed to supersede the  open grate, which supplies a ventilation to the room as useful to the  health of the books as to the health of the occupier. A coal fire is  objectionable on many grounds. It is dangerous, dirty and dusty. On the  other hand an asbestos fire, where the lumps are judiciously laid,  gives all the warmth and ventilation of a common fire without any of its  annoyances; and to any one who loves to be independent of servants, and  to know that, however deeply he may sleep over his \"copy,\" his fire will  not fail to keep awake, an asbestos stove is invaluable.    It is a mistake also to imagine that keeping the best bound volumes in  a glass doored book-case is a preservative. The damp air will certainly  penetrate, and as the absence of ventilation will assist the formation  of mould, the books will be worse off than if they had been placed in  open shelves. If security be desirable, by all means abolish the glass  and place ornamental brass wire-work in its stead. Like the writers of  old Cookery Books who stamped special receipts with the testimony of  personal experience, I can say \"probatum est.\"        CHAPTER III. GAS AND HEAT.    WHAT a valuable servant is Gas, and how dreadfully we should cry out  were it to be banished from our homes; and yet no one who loves his  books should allow a single jet in his library, unless, indeed he can  afford a \"sun light,\" which is the form in which it is used in some  public libraries, where the whole of the fumes are carried at once into  the open air.    Unfortunately, I can speak from experience of the dire effect of gas  in a confined space. Some years ago when placing the shelves round the  small room, which, by a euphemism, is called my library, I took the  precaution of making two self-acting ventilators which communicated  directly with the outer air just under the ceiling. For economy of space  as well as of temper (for lamps of all kinds are sore trials), I had a  gasalier of three lights over the table. The effect was to cause great  heat in the upper regions, and in the course of a year or two the  leather valance which hung from the window, as well as the fringe which  dropped half-an-inch from each shelf to keep out the dust, was just like  tinder, and in some parts actually fell to the ground by its own weight;  while the backs of the books upon the top shelves were perished, and  crumbled away when touched, being reduced to the consistency of Scotch  snuff. This was, of course, due to the sulphur in the gas fumes. I  remember having a book some years ago from the top shelf in the library  of the London Institution, where gas is used, and the whole of the back  fell off in my hands, although the volume in other respects seemed quite  uninjured. Thousands more were in a similar plight.    As the paper of the volumes is uninjured, it might be objected "]]]
