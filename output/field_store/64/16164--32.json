Intellectually awakened women were  attracted possibly as much by Richter's knowledge of their feelings as  by the fascination of his personality. _Hesperus_ lays bare many  little wiles dear to feminine hearts, and contains some keenly  sympathetic satire on German housewifery.    While still at work on _Hesperus_ Jean Paul returned to his mother's  house at Hof. \"Richter's study and sitting-room offered about this  time,\" says Doering, his first biographer, \"a true and beautiful  picture of his simple yet noble mind, which took in both high and low.  While his mother bustled about the housework at fire or table he sat  in a corner of the same room at a plain writing-desk with few or no  books at hand, but only one or two drawers with excerpts and  manuscripts. * * * Pigeons fluttered in and out of the chamber.\"    At Hof, Jean Paul continued to teach with originality and much success  until 1796, when an invitation from Charlotte von Kalb to visit Weimar  brought him new interests and connections. Meanwhile, having finished  _Hesperus_ in July, 1794, he began work immediately on the genial  _Life of Quintus Fixlein, Based on Fifteen Little Boxes of Memoranda_,  an idyl, like _Wuz_, of the schoolhouse and the parsonage, reflecting  Richter's pedagogical interests and much of his personal experience.  Its satire of philological pedantry has not yet lost pertinence or  pungency. Quintus, ambitious of authorship, proposes to himself a  catalogued interpretation of misprints in German books and other tasks  hardly less laboriously futile. His creator treats him with unfailing  good humor and \"the consciousness of a kindred folly.\" Fixlein is the  archetypal pedant. The very heart of humor is in the account of the  commencement exercises at his school. His little childishnesses are  delightfully set forth; so, too, is his awe of aristocracy. He always  took off his hat before the windows of the manor house, even if he saw  no one there. The crown of it all is The Wedding. The bridal pair's  visit to the graves of by-gone loves is a gem of fantasy. But behind  all the humor and satire must not be forgotten, in view of what was to  follow, the undercurrent of courageous democratic protest which finds  its keenest expression in the \"Free Note\" to Chapter Six. _Fixlein_  appeared in 1796.    Richter's next story, the unfinished _Biographical Recreations under  the Cranium of a Giantess_, sprang immediately from a visit to  Bayreuth in 1794 and his first introduction to aristocracy. Its chief  interest is in the enthusiastic welcome it extends to the French  Revolution. Intrinsically more important is the _Flower, Fruit and  Thorn Pieces_ which crowded the other subject from his mind and tells  with much idyllic charm of \"the marriage, life, death and wedding of  F. H. Siebenkaes, Advocate of the Poor\" (1796-7).    In 1796, at the suggestion of the gifted, emancipated and ill-starred  Charlotte von Kalb, Jean Paul visited Weimar, already a Mecca of  literary pilgrimage and the centre of neo-classicism. There, those  who, like Herder, were jealous of Goethe, and those who, like Frau von  Stein, were estranged from him, received the new light with  enthusiasm--others with some reserve. Goethe and Schiller, who were  seeking to blend the classical with the German spirit, demurred to the  vagaries of Jean Paul's unquestioned genius. His own account of his  visit to \"the rock-bound Schiller\" and to Goethe's \"palatial hall\" are  precious commonplaces of the histories of literature. There were sides  of Goethe's universal genius to which Richter felt akin, but he was  quite ready to listen to Herder's warning against his townsman's  \"unrouged\" infidelity, which had become socially more objectionable  since Goethe's union with Christiane Vulpius, and Jean Paul presently  returned to Hof, carrying with him the heart of Charlotte von Kalb, an  unprized and somewhat embarrassing possession. He wished no heroine;  for he was no hero, as he remarked dryly, somewhat later, when  Charlotte had become the first of many \"beautiful souls\" in confusion  of spirit about their heart's desire.    In 1797 the death of Jean Paul's mother dissolved home bonds and he  soon left Hof forever, though still for a time maintaining diligent  correspondence with the \"erotic academy\" as well as with new and more  aristocratic \"daughters of the Storm and Stress.\" The writings of this  period are unimportant, some of them unworthy. Jean Paul was for a  time in Leipzig and in Dresden. In October, 1798, he was again in  Weimar, which, in the sunshine of Herder's praise, seemed at first his  \"Canaan,\" though he soon felt himself out of tune with Duchess  Amalia's literary court. To this time belongs a curious _Conjectural  Biography_, a pretty idyl of an ideal courtship and marriage as his  fancy now painted it for himself. Presently he was moved to essay the  realization of this ideal and was for a time betrothed to Karoline von  Feuchtersleben, her aristocratic connections being partially reconciled  to the _mesalliance_ by Richter's appointment as Legationsrat. He  begins already to look forward, a little ruefully, to the time when his  heart shall be \"an extinct marriage-crater,\" and after a visit to  Berlin, where he basked in the smiles of Queen Luise, he was again  betrothed, this time to the less intellectually gifted, but as devoted  and better dowered Karoline Mayer, whom he married in 1801. He was then  in his thirty-eighth year.    Richter's marriage is cardinal in his career. Some imaginative work he  was still to do, but the dominant interests were hereafter to be in  education and in political action. In his own picturesque language,  hitherto his quest had been for the golden fleece of womanhood,  hereafter it was to be for a crusade of men. The change had been  already foreshadowed in 1799 by his stirring paper _On Charlotte  Corday_ (published in 1801).    _Titan_, which Jean Paul regarded as his \"principal work and most  complete creation,\" had been in his mind since 1792. It was begun in  1797 and finished, soon after his betrothal, in 1800. In this novel the  thought of God and immortality is offered as a solution of all problems  of nature and society. _Titan_ is human will in contest with the  divine harmony. The maturing Richter has come to see that idealism in  thought and feeling must be balanced by realism in action if the thinker  is to bear his part in the work of the world. The novel naturally falls  far short of realizing its vast design. Once more the parts are more  than the whole. Some descriptive passages are very remarkable and the  minor characters, notably Roquairol, the Mephistophelean Lovelace, are  more interesting than the hero or the heroine. The unfinished _Wild  Oats_ of 1804, follows a somewhat similar design. The story of Walt  and Vult, twin brothers, Love and Knowledge, offers a study in contrasts  between the dreamy and the practical, with much self-revelation of the  antinomy in the author's own nature. There is something here to recall  his early satires, much more to suggest Goethe's _Wilhelm Meister_.    While _Wild Oats_ was in the making, Richter with his young wife and  presently their first daughter, Emma, was making a sort of triumphal  progress among the court towns of Germany. He received about this time  from Prince Dalberg a pension, afterward continued by the King of  Bavaria. In 1804 the family settled in Bayreuth, which was to remain  Richter's not always happy home till his death in 1825.    The move to Bayreuth was marked by the appearance of _Introduction to  Esthetics_, a book that, even in remaining a fragment, shows the  parting of the ways. Under its frolicsome exuberance there is keen  analysis, a fine nobility of temper, and abundant subtle observation.  The philosophy was Herder's, and a glowing eulogy of him closes the  study. Its most original and perhaps most valuable section contains a  shrewd discrimination of the varieties of humor, and ends with a  brilliant praise of wit, as though in a recapitulating review of  Richter's own most distinctive contribution to German literature.    The first fruit to ripen at the Bayreuth home was _Levana_, finished  in October, 1806, just as Napoleon was crushing the power of Prussia  at Jena. Though disconnected and unsystematic _Levana_ has been for  three generations a true yeast of pedagogical ideas, especially in  regard to the education of women and their social position in Germany.  Against the ignorance of the then existing conditions Jean Paul raised  eloquent and indignant protest. \"Your teachers, your companions, even  your parents,\" he exclaims, \"trample and crush the little flowers you  shelter and cherish. * * * Your hands are used more than your heads.  They let you play, but only with your fans. Nothing is pardoned you,  least of all a heart.\" What _Levana_ says of the use and abuse of  philology and about the study of history as a preparation for  political action is no less significant. Goethe, who had been reticent  of praise in regard to the novels, found in _Levana_ \"the boldest  virtues without the least excess.\"    From the education of children for life Richter turned naturally to  the education of his fellow Germans for citizenship. It was a time of  national crisis. Already in 1805 he had published a _Little Book of  Freedom_, in protest against the censorship of books. Now to his  countrymen, oppressed by Napoleon, he addressed at intervals from 1808  to 1810, a _Peace Sermon, Twilight Thoughts for Germany_ and _After  Twilight_. Then, as the fires of Moscow heralded a new day, came  _Butterflies of the Dawn_; and when the War of Liberation was over and  the German rulers had proved false to their promises, these  \"Butterflies\" were expanded and transformed, in 1817, into _Political  Fast-Sermons for Germany's Martyr-Week_, in which Richter denounced  the princes for their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12063"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 14, No. 388, (#3)"],[1,"people. At several places,  by the margin of the lake, are small clusters of winter and summer wigwams  in ruins. One difference, among others, between the Boeothick wigwams and  those of the other Indians, is, that in most of the former there are small  hollows, like nests, dug in the earth around the fireplace, one for each  person to sit in. These hollows are generally so close together, and also  so close to the fireplace, and to the sides of the wigwam, that I think it  probable these people have been accustomed to sleep in a sitting position.  There was one wooden building constructed for drying and smoking venison  in, still perfect; also a small log-house, in a dilapidated condition,  which we took to have been once a storehouse. The wreck of a large,  handsome, birch-rind canoe, about twenty-two feet in length, comparatively  new, and certainly very little used, lay thrown up among the bushes at the  beach. We supposed that the violence of a storm had rent it in the way it  was found, and that the people who were in it had perished; for the iron  nails, of which there was no want, all remained in it. Had there been any  survivors, nails being much prized by these people, they never having held  intercourse with Europeans, such an article would most likely have been  taken out for use again. All the birch trees in the vicinity of the lake  had been rinded, and many of them, and of the spruce fir, or var, had the  bark taken off, to use the inner part of it for food, as noticed before.\"    \"Their wooden repositories for the dead are what are in the most perfect  state of preservation. These are of different constructions, it would  appear, according to the character or rank of the persons entombed. In one  of them, which resembled a hut ten feet by eight or nine, and four or five  feet high in the centre, floored with squared poles, the roof covered with  rinds of trees, and in every way well secured against the weather inside,  and the intrusion of wild beasts, there were two grown persons laid out at  full length, on the floor, the bodies wrapped round with deerskins. One of  these bodies appeared to have been placed here not longer ago than five or  six years. We thought there were children laid in here also. On first  opening this building, by removing the posts which formed the ends, our  curiosity was raised to the highest pitch; but what added to our surprise,  was the discovery of a white deal coffin, containing a skeleton neatly  shrouded in white muslin. After a long pause of conjecture how such a thing  existed here, the idea of _Mary March_ occurred to one of the party, and  the whole mystery was at once explained.[3]\"        [3] It should be remarked here, that Mary March, so called from the          name of the month in which she was taken, was the Red Indian          female who was captured and carried away by force from this          place by an armed party of English people, nine or ten in          number, who came up here in the month of March, 1809. The local          government authorities at that time did not foresee the result          of offering a reward to _bring a Red Indian to them_. Her          husband was cruelly shot, after nobly making several attempts,          single-handed, to rescue her from the captors, in defiance of          their fire-arms, and fixed bayonets. His tribe built this          cemetery for him, on the foundation of his own wigwam, and his          body is one of those now in it. The following winter, Captain          Buchan was sent to the River Exploits, by order of the local          government of Newfoundland, to take back this woman to the lake,          where she was captured, and if possible at the same time, to          open a friendly intercourse with her tribe. But she died on          board Captain B.'s vessel, at the mouth of the river. Captain B.          however, took up her body to the lake; and not meeting with any          of her people, left it where they were afterwards likely to meet          with it. It appears the Indians were this winter encamped on the          banks of the River Exploits, and observed Captain B.'s party          passing up the river on the ice. They retired from their          encampments in consequence; and, some weeks afterwards, went by          a circuitous route to the lake, to ascertain what the party had          been doing there. They found _Mary March's_ body, and removed it          from where Captain B. had left it to where it now lies, by the          side of her husband.            With the exception of Captain Buchan's first expedition, by          order of the local government of Newfoundland, in the winter of          1810, to endeavour to open a friendly intercourse with the Red          Indians, the two parties just mentioned are the only two we know          of that had ever before been up to the Red Indian Lake. Captain          B. at that time succeeded in forcing an interview with the          principal encampment of these people. All of the tribe that          remained at that period were then at the Great Lake, divided          into parties, and in their winter encampments, at different          places in the woods on the margin of the lake. Hostages were          exchanged; but Captain B. had not been absent from the Indians          two hours, in his return to a depot left by him at a short          distance down the river, to take up additional presents for          them, when the want of confidence of these people in the whites          evinced itself. A suspicion spread among them that he had gone          down to bring up a reinforcement of men, to take them all          prisoners to the sea-coast; and they resolved immediately to          break up their encampment and retire farther into the country,          and alarm and join the rest of their tribe, who were all at the          western parts of the lake. To prevent their proceedings being          known, they killed and then cut off the heads of the two English          hostages; and, on the same afternoon on which Captain B. had          left them, they were in full retreat across the lake, with          baggage, children, &c. The whole of them afterwards spent the          remainder of the winter together, at a place twenty to thirty          miles to the south-west, on the south-east side of the lake. On          Captain B.'s return to the lake next day or the day after, the          cause of the scene there was inexplicable; and it remained a          mystery until now, when we can gather some facts relating to          these people from the Red Indian woman, _Shawnawdithit_.    \"In this cemetery were deposited a variety of articles, in some instances  the property, in others the representations of the property and utensils,  and of the achievements, of the deceased. There were two small wooden  images of a man and woman, no doubt meant to represent husband and wife and  a small doll which we supposed to represent a child (for _Mary March_ had  to leave her only child here, which died two days after she was taken);  several small models of their canoes; two small models of boats; an iron  axe; a bow and quiver of arrows were placed by the side of _Mary March's_  husband; and two fire-stones (radiated iron pyrites, from which they  produce fire, by striking them together) lay at his head; there were also  various kinds of culinary utensils, neatly made, of birch rind and  ornamented; and many other things, of some of which we did not know the use  or meaning.\"    \"Another mode of sepulture which we saw here was, where the body of the  deceased had been wrapped in birch rind, and with his property, placed on a  sort of scaffold about four feet and a half from the ground. The scaffold  was formed of four posts, about seven feet high, fixed perpendicularly in  the ground, to sustain a kind of crib, five feet and a half in length, by  four in breadth, with a floor made of small squared beams, laid close  together horizontally, and on which the body and property rested.\"    \"A third mode was, when the body, bent together, and wrapped in birch rind,  was enclosed in a kind of box, on the ground. The box was made of small  squared posts, laid on each other horizontally, and notched at the corners,  to make them meet close; it was about four feet by three, and two and a  half feet deep, and well lined with birch rind, to exclude the weather from  the inside. The body lay on its right side.\"    \"A fourth and the most common mode of burying among these people, has been,  to wrap the body in birch rind, and cover it over with a heap of stones, on  the surface of the earth, in some retired spot; sometimes the body, thus  wrapped up, is put a foot or two under the surface, and the spot covered  with stones; in one place, where the ground was sandy and soft, they  appeared to have been buried deeper, and no stones placed over the graves.\"    \"These people appear to have always shewn great respect for their dead; and  the most remarkable remains of them commonly observed by Europeans at the  sea-coast, are their burying-places. These are at particular chosen spots;  and it is well known that they have been in the habit of bringing their  dead from a distance to them. With their women they bury only their  clothes.\"    \"On the north-side of the lake, opposite the River Exploits, are the  extremities of two deer fences, about half a mile apart, where they lead to  the water. It is understood that they diverge many miles in north-westerly  directions. The Red Indian makes these fences to lead and scare the deer to  the lake, during the periodical migration of these animals; the Indians  being stationed looking out, when the deer get into the water to swim  across, the lake being narrow at this end, they attack and kill the animals  with spears out of their canoes. In this way they secure their winter  provisions before the severity of that"]]]
