I could not die with you,  For one must wait  To shut the other's gaze down, --  You could not.    And I, could I stand by  And see you freeze,  Without my right of frost,  Death's privilege?    Nor could I rise with you,  Because your face  Would put out Jesus',  That new grace    Glow plain and foreign  On my homesick eye,  Except that you, than he  Shone closer by.    They'd judge us -- how?  For you served Heaven, you know,  Or sought to;  I could not,    Because you saturated sight,  And I had no more eyes  For sordid excellence  As Paradise.    And were you lost, I would be,  Though my name  Rang loudest  On the heavenly fame.    And were you saved,  And I condemned to be  Where you were not,  That self were hell to me.    So we must keep apart,  You there, I here,  With just the door ajar  That oceans are,  And prayer,  And that pale sustenance,  Despair!            XIII.    RENUNCIATION.    There came a day at summer's full  Entirely for me;  I thought that such were for the saints,  Where revelations be.    The sun, as common, went abroad,  The flowers, accustomed, blew,  As if no soul the solstice passed  That maketh all things new.    The time was scarce profaned by speech;  The symbol of a word  Was needless, as at sacrament  The wardrobe of our Lord.    Each was to each the sealed church,  Permitted to commune this time,  Lest we too awkward show  At supper of the Lamb.    The hours slid fast, as hours will,  Clutched tight by greedy hands;  So faces on two decks look back,  Bound to opposing lands.    And so, when all the time had failed,  Without external sound,  Each bound the other's crucifix,  We gave no other bond.    Sufficient troth that we shall rise --  Deposed, at length, the grave --  To that new marriage, justified  Through Calvaries of Love!            XIV.    LOVE'S BAPTISM.    I'm ceded, I've stopped being theirs;  The name they dropped upon my face  With water, in the country church,  Is finished using now,  And they can put it with my dolls,  My childhood, and the string of spools  I've finished threading too.    Baptized before without the choice,  But this time consciously, of grace  Unto supremest name,  Called to my full, the crescent dropped,  Existence's whole arc filled up  With one small diadem.    My second rank, too small the first,  Crowned, crowing on my father's breast,  A half unconscious queen;  But this time, adequate, erect,  With will to choose or to reject.  And I choose -- just a throne.            XV.    RESURRECTION.    'T was a long parting, but the time  For interview had come;  Before the judgment-seat of God,  The last and second time    These fleshless lovers met,  A heaven in a gaze,  A heaven of heavens, the privilege  Of one another's eyes.    No lifetime set on them,  Apparelled as the new  Unborn, except they had beheld,  Born everlasting now.    Was bridal e'er like this?  A paradise, the host,  And cherubim and seraphim  The most familiar guest.            XVI.    APOCALYPSE.    I'm wife; I've finished that,  That other state;  I'm Czar, I'm woman now:  It's safer so.    How odd the girl's life looks  Behind this soft eclipse!  I think that earth seems so  To those in heaven now.    This being comfort, then  That other kind was pain;  But why compare?  I'm wife! stop there!            XVII.    THE WIFE.    She rose to his requirement, dropped  The playthings of her life  To take the honorable work  Of woman and of wife.    If aught she missed in her new day  Of amplitude, or awe,  Or first prospective, or the gold  In using wore away,    It lay unmentioned, as the sea  Develops pearl and weed,  But only to himself is known  The fathoms they abide.            XVIII.    APOTHEOSIS.    Come slowly, Eden!  Lips unused to thee,  Bashful, sip thy jasmines,  As the fainting bee,    Reaching late his flower,  Round her chamber hums,  Counts his nectars -- enters,  And is lost in balms!                        III. NATURE.    I.    New feet within my garden go,  New fingers stir the sod;  A troubadour upon the elm  Betrays the solitude.    New children play upon the green,  New weary sleep below;  And still the pensive spring returns,  And still the punctual snow!            II.    MAY-FLOWER.    Pink, small, and punctual,  Aromatic, low,  Covert in April,  Candid in May,    Dear to the moss,  Known by the knoll,  Next to the robin  In every human soul.    Bold little beauty,  Bedecked with thee,  Nature forswears  Antiquity.            III.    WHY?    The murmur of a bee  A witchcraft yieldeth me.  If any ask me why,  'T were easier to die  Than tell.    The red upon the hill  Taketh away my will;  If anybody sneer,  Take care, for God is here,  That's all.    The breaking of the day  Addeth to my degree;  If any ask me how,  Artist, who drew me so,  Must tell!            IV.    Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower?  But I could never sell.  If you would like to borrow  Until the daffodil    Unties her yellow bonnet  Beneath the village door,  Until the bees, from clover rows  Their hock and sherry draw,    Why, I will lend until just then,  But not an hour more!            V.    The pedigree of honey  Does not concern the bee;  A clover, any time, to him  Is aristocracy.            VI.    A SERVICE OF SONG.    Some keep the Sabbath going to church;  I keep it staying at home,  With a bobolink for a chorister,  And an orchard for a dome.    Some keep the Sabbath in surplice;  I just wear my wings,  And instead of tolling the bell for church,  Our little sexton sings.    God preaches, -- a noted clergyman, --  And the sermon is never long;  So instead of getting to heaven at last,  I'm going all along!            VII.    The bee is not afraid of me,  I know the butterfly;  The pretty people in the woods  Receive me cordially.    The brooks laugh louder when I come,  The breezes madder play.  Wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists?  Wherefore, O summer's day?            VIII.    SUMMER'S ARMIES.    Some rainbow coming from the fair!  Some vision of the world Cashmere  I confidently see!  Or else a peacock's purple train,  Feather by feather, on the plain  Fritters itself away!    The dreamy butterflies bestir,  Lethargic pools resume the whir  Of last year's sundered tune.  From some old fortress on the sun  Baronial bees march, one by one,  In murmuring platoon!    The robins stand as thick to-day  As flakes of snow stood yesterday,  On fence and roof and twig.  The orchis binds her feather on  For her old lover, Don the Sun,  Revisiting the bog!    Without commander, countless, still,  The regiment of wood and hill  In bright detachment stand.  Behold! Whose multitudes are these?  The children of whose turbaned seas,  Or what Circassian land?            IX.    THE GRASS.    The grass so little has to do, --  A sphere of simple green,  With only butterflies to brood,  And bees to entertain,    And stir all day to pretty tunes  The breezes fetch along,  And hold the sunshine in its lap  And bow to everything;    And thread the dews all night, like pearls,  And make itself so fine, --  A duchess were too common  For such a noticing.    And even when it dies, to pass  In odors so divine,  As lowly spices gone to sleep,  Or amulets of pine.    And then to dwell in sovereign barns,  And dream the days away, --  The grass so little has to do,  I wish I were the hay!            X.    A little road not made of man,  Enabled of the eye,  Accessible to thill of bee,  Or cart of butterfly.    If town it have, beyond itself,  'T is that I cannot say;  I only sigh, -- no vehicle  Bears me along that way.            XI.    SUMMER SHOWER.    A drop fell on the apple tree,  Another on the roof;  A half a dozen kissed the eaves,  And made the gables laugh.    A few went out to help the brook,  That went to help the sea.  Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,  What necklaces could be!    The dust replaced in hoisted roads,  The birds jocoser sung;  The sunshine threw his hat away,  The orchards spangles hung.    The breezes brought dejected lutes,  And bathed them in the glee;  The East put out a single flag,  And signed the fete away.            XII.    PSALM OF THE DAY.    A something in a summer's day,  As slow her flambeaux burn away,  Which solemnizes me.    A something in a summer's noon, --  An azure depth, a wordless tune,  Transcending ecstasy.    And still within a summer's night  A something so transporting bright,  I clap my hands to see;    Then veil my too inspecting face,  Lest such a subtle, shimmering grace  Flutter too far for me.    The wizard-fingers never rest,  The purple brook within the breast  Still chafes its narrow bed;    Still rears the East her amber flag,  Guides still the sun along the crag  His caravan of red,    Like flowers that heard the tale of dews,  But never deemed the dripping prize  Awaited their low brows;    Or bees, that thought the summer's name  Some rumor of delirium  No summer could for them;    Or Arctic creature, dimly stirred  By tropic hint, -- some travelled bird  Imported to the wood;    Or wind's bright signal to the ear,  Making that homely and severe,  Contented, known, before    The heaven unexpected came,  To lives that thought their worshipping  A too presumptuous psalm.            XIII.    THE SEA OF SUNSET.    This is the land the sunset washes,  These are the banks of the Yellow Sea;  Where it rose, or whither it rushes,  These are the western mystery!    Night after night her purple traffic  Strews the landing with opal bales;  Merchantmen poise upon horizons,  Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.            XIV.    PURPLE CLOVER.    There is a flower that bees prefer,  And butterflies desire;  To gain the purple democrat  The humming-birds aspire.    And whatsoever insect pass,  A honey bears away  Proportioned to his several dearth  And her capacity.    Her face is rounder than the moon,  And ruddier than the gown  Of orchis in the pasture,  Or rhododendron worn.    She doth not"]]]
