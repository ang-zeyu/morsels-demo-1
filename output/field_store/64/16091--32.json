In the desert beyond the city  boundaries he wandered, searching for inspiration, waiting dumbly in the  darkness until the angel Gabriel descended with rush of wings through the  brightness of heaven, commanding:    \"Cry aloud, in the name of the Lord who created thee. O, thou enwrapped  in thy mantle, arise and warn!\"    Mecca lies in a stony valley midway between Yemen, \"the Blessed,\" and  Syria, in the midst of the western coast-chain of Arabia, which slopes  gradually towards the Red Sea. The height of Abu Kobeis overlooks the  eastern quarter of the town, whence hills of granite stretch to the  holy places, Mina and Arafat, enclosed by the ramparts of the Jebel  Kora range. Beyond these mountains to the south lies Taif, with  its glory of gardens and fruit-trees. But the luxuriance of Taif  finds no counterpart on the western side. Mecca is barren and treeless;  its sandy stretches only broken here and there by low hills of quartz  or gneiss, scrub-covered and dusty. The sun beats upon the shelterless  town until it becomes a great cauldron within its amphitheatre of hills.  During the Greater Pilgrimage the cauldron seethes with heat and  humanity, and surges over into Mina and Arafat. In the daytime Mecca is  limitless heat and noise, but under the stars it has all the magic of a  dream-city in a country of wide horizons.    The shadow of its ancient prosperity, when it was the centre of the  caravan trade from Yemen to Syria, still hung about it in the years  immediately before the birth of Mahomet, and the legends concerning the  founding of the city lingered in the native mind. Hagar, in her terrible  journey through the desert, reached Mecca and laid her son in the midst  of the valley to go on the hopeless quest for water. The child kicked the  ground in torment, and God was merciful, so that from his heel marks  arose a spring of clear water--the well Zemzem, hallowed ever after by  Meccans. In this desolate place part of the Amalekites and tribes from  Yemen settled; the child Ishmael grew up amongst them and founded his  race by marrying a daughter of the chief. Abraham visited him, and under  his guidance the native temple of the Kaaba was built and dedicated to  the true God, but afterwards desecrated by the worship of idols within  it.    Such are the legends surrounding the foundation of Mecca and of the  Kaaba, of which, as of the legends concerning the early days of Rome, it  may be said that they are chiefly interesting as throwing light upon the  character of the race which produced them. In the case of Mecca they were  mainly the result of an unconscious desire to associate the city as far  as possible with the most renowned heroes of old time, and also to  conciliate the Jewish element within Arabia, now firmly planted at  Medina, Kheibar, and some of the adjoining territory, by insisting on a  Jewish origin for their holy of holies, and as soon as Abraham and  Ishmael were established as fathers of the race, legends concerning them  were in perpetual creation.    The Kaaba thus reputed to be the work of Abraham bears evidence of an  antiquity so remote that its beginnings will be forever lost to us. From  very early times it was a goal of pilgrimage for all Arabia, because of  the position of Mecca upon the chief trade route, and united in its  ceremonies the native worship of the sun and stars, idols and misshapen  stones. The Black Stone, the kissing of which formed the chief  ceremonial, is a relic of the rites practised by the stone-worshippers of  old; while the seven circuits of the Kaaba, obligatory on all pilgrims,  are probably a symbol of the courses of the planets. Arab divinities,  such as Alilat and Uzza, were associated with the Kaaba before any  records are available, and at the time of Mahomet, idolatry mingled with  various rites still held sway among the Meccans, though the leaven of  Jewish tradition was of great help to him in the establishment of the  monotheistic idea. At Mahomet's birth the Kaaba consisted of a small  roofless house, with the Black Stone imbedded in its wall. Near it lay  the well Zemzem, and the reputed grave of Ishmael. The Holy Place of  Arabia held thus within itself traces of a purer faith, that  were to be discovered and filled in by Mahomet, until the Kaaba  became the goal of thousands, the recipient of the devotion and longings  of that mighty host of Muslim who went forth to subdue the world.  Mahomet's ancestors had for some time held a high position in the city.  He came of the race of Hashim, whose privilege it was to give service to  the pilgrims coming to worship at the Kaaba. The Hashim were renowned for  generosity, and Mahomet's grandfather, Abd al Muttalib, was revered by  the Kureisch, inhabitants of Mecca, as a just and honourable man, who had  greatly increased their prosperity by his rediscovery of the holy well.    Its healing waters had been choked by the accumulations of years, so  that even the knowledge of its site was lost, when an angel appeared to  Abd al Muttalib, as he slept at the gate of the temple, saying:    \"Dig up that which is pure!\"    Three times the command fell on uncomprehending ears, until the angel  revealed to the sleeper where the precious water might be found. And as  he dug, the well burst forth once more, and behold within its deeps lay  two golden gazelles, with weapons, the treasure of former kings. And  there was strife among the Kureisch for the possession of these riches,  until they were forced to draw lots. So the treasure fell to Abd al  Muttalib, who melted the weapons to make a door for the Kaaba, and set  up the golden gazelles within it.    Abd al Muttalib figures very prominently in the early legends concerning  Mahomet, because he was sole guardian of the Prophet during very early  childhood. These legends are mainly later accretions, but the kernel of  truth within them is not difficult to discover. Like all forerunners of  the great teachers, he stands in communion with heavenly messengers, the  symbol of his purity of heart. He is humble, compassionate, and devout,  living continually in the presence of his god--a fitting guardian for  the renewer of the faith of his nation. Most significant of the legends  is the story of his vow to sacrifice a son if ten were born to him, and  of the choice of Abdullah, Mahomet's father, and the repeated staying of  the father's hand, so that the sacrifice could not be accomplished until  is son's life was bought with the blood of a hundred camels. This and  all allied legends are fruit of a desire to magnify the divine authority  of Mahomet's mission by dwelling on the intervention of a higher power  in the disposal of his fate.    Of Abd al Muttalib's ten sons, Abdallah was the most handsome in form  and stature, so that the fame of his beauty spread into the harems  of the city, and many women coveted him in their hearts. But he, after  his father had sacrificed the camels in his stead, went straightway to  the house of Amina, a maiden well-born and lovely, and remained there to  complete his nuptials with her. Then, after some weeks, he departed to  Gaza for the exchange of merchandise, but, returning, was overtaken by  sickness and died at Medina.    Amina, left thus desolate, sought the house of Abd al Muttalib, where  she stayed until her child was born. Visions of his future greatness  were vouchsafed to her before his birth by an angel, who told her the  name he was to bear, and his destiny as Prophet of his people. Long  before the child's eyes opened to the light, a brightness surrounded his  mother, so that by it might be seen the far-off towers of the castles in  Syrian Bostra. A tenderness hangs over the story of Mahomet's birth,  akin to that immortal beauty surrounding the coming of Christ. We have  faint glimpses of Amina, in the dignity of her sorrow, waiting for the  birth of her son, and in the house of Mecca's leading citizen, hearing  around her not alone the celestial voices of her spirit-comforters, but  also rumours of earthly strife and the threatenings of strange armies  from the south.    At Sana, capital of Yemen, ruled Abraha, king of the southern province.  He built a vast temple within its walls, and purposed to make Sana the  pilgrim-city for all Arabia. But the old custom still clove to Mecca,  and finding he could in nowise coerce the people into forsaking the  Kaaba, he determined to invade Mecca itself and to destroy the rival  place of worship. So he gathered together a great army, which numbered  amongst it an elephant, a fearful sight to the Meccans, who had never  seen so great an animal. With this force he marched upon Mecca, and was  about to enter the city after fruitless attempts by Abd al Muttalib to  obtain quarter, when God sent down a scourge of sickness upon his army  and he was forced to retreat, returning miserably to Sana with a remnant  of his men. But so much had the presence of the elephant alarmed the  Meccans that the year (A.D. 570) was called ever after \"The Year of the  Elephant,\" and in August thereof Mahomet was born.    Then Amina sent for Abd al Muttalib and told him the marvels she had  seen and heard, and his grandfather took the child and presented him in  the Kaaba, after the manner of the Jews, and gave him the name Mahomet  (the Praised One), according as the angel had commanded Amina.    The countless legends surrounding Mahomet's birth, even to the physical  marvel that accompanied it, cannot be set aside as utterly worthless.  They serve to show the temper of the nation producing them, deeply  imaginative and incoherently poetical, and they indicate the weight of  the personality to which they cling. All the devotion of the East  informs them; but since"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#3)"],[1,"than a certain Colonel John Mohune,  deceased about one hundred years ago. He would have it that Colonel  Mohune, in the dreadful wars against King Charles the First, had deserted  the allegiance of his house and supported the cause of the rebels. So  being made Governor of Carisbrooke Castle for the Parliament, he became  there the King's jailer, but was false to his trust. For the King,  carrying constantly hidden about his person a great diamond which had  once been given him by his brother King of France, Mohune got wind of  this jewel, and promised that if it were given him he would wink at His  Majesty's escape. Then this wicked man, having taken the bribe, plays  traitor again, comes with a file of soldiers at the hour appointed for  the King's flight, finds His Majesty escaping through a window, has him  away to a stricter ward, and reports to the Parliament that the King's  escape is only prevented by Colonel Mohune's watchfulness. But how true,  as Mr. Glennie said, that we should not be envious against the ungodly,  against the man that walketh after evil counsels. Suspicion fell on  Colonel Mohune; he was removed from his Governorship, and came back to  his home at Moonfleet. There he lived in seclusion, despised by both  parties in the State, until he died, about the time of the happy  Restoration of King Charles the Second. But even after his death he could  not get rest; for men said that he had hid somewhere that treasure given  him to permit the King's escape, and that not daring to reclaim it, had  let the secret die with him, and so must needs come out of his grave to  try to get at it again. Mr. Glennie would never say whether he believed  the tale or not, pointing out that apparitions both of good and evil  spirits are related in Holy Scripture, but that the churchyard was an  unlikely spot for Colonel Mohune to seek his treasure in; for had it been  buried there, he would have had a hundred chances to have it up in his  lifetime. However this may be, though I was brave as a lion by day, and  used indeed to frequent the churchyard, because there was the widest  view of the sea to be obtained from it, yet no reward would have taken me  thither at night. Nor was I myself without some witness to the tale, for  having to walk to Ringstave for Dr. Hawkins on the night my aunt broke  her leg, I took the path along the down which overlooks the churchyard at  a mile off; and thence most certainly saw a light moving to and fro about  the church, where no honest man could be at two o'clock in the morning.          CHAPTER 2    THE FLOODS    Then banks came down with ruin and rout,  Then beaten spray flew round about,  Then all the mighty floods were out,    And all the world was in the sea _--Jean Ingelow_      On the third of November, a few days after this visit to the Why Not?,  the wind, which had been blowing from the south-west, began about four in  the afternoon to rise in sudden strong gusts. The rooks had been  pitch-falling all the morning, so we knew that bad weather was due; and  when we came out from the schooling that Mr. Glennie gave us in the hall  of the old almshouses, there were wisps of thatch, and even stray tiles,  flying from the roofs, and the children sang:    Blow wind, rise storm,  Ship ashore before morn.    It is heathenish rhyme that has come down out of other and worse times;  for though I do not say but that a wreck on Moonfleet beach was looked  upon sometimes as little short of a godsend, yet I hope none of us were  so wicked as to _wish_ a vessel to be wrecked that we might share in the  plunder. Indeed, I have known the men of Moonfleet risk their own lives a  hundred times to save those of shipwrecked mariners, as when the  _Darius_, East Indiaman, came ashore; nay, even poor nameless corpses  washed up were sure of Christian burial, or perhaps of one of Master  Ratsey's headstones to set forth sex and date, as may be seen in the  churchyard to this day.    Our village lies near the centre of Moonfleet Bay, a great bight twenty  miles across, and a death-trap to up-channel sailors in a  south-westerly gale. For with that wind blowing strong from south, if  you cannot double the Snout, you must most surely come ashore; and many  a good ship failing to round that point has beat up and down the bay  all day, but come to beach in the evening. And once on the beach, the  sea has little mercy, for the water is deep right in, and the waves  curl over full on the pebbles with a weight no timbers can withstand.  Then if poor fellows try to save themselves, there is a deadly  under-tow or rush back of the water, which sucks them off their legs,  and carries them again under the thundering waves. It is that back-suck  of the pebbles that you may hear for miles inland, even at Dorchester,  on still nights long after the winds that caused it have sunk, and  which makes people turn in their beds, and thank God they are not  fighting with the sea on Moonfleet beach.    But on this third of November there was no wreck, only such a wind as I  have never known before, and only once since. All night long the tempest  grew fiercer, and I think no one in Moonfleet went to bed; for there was  such a breaking of tiles and glass, such a banging of doon and rattling  of shutters, that no sleep was possible, and we were afraid besides lest  the chimneys should fall and crush us. The wind blew fiercest about five  in the morning, and then some ran up the street calling out a new  danger--that the sea was breaking over the beach, and that all the place  was like to be flooded. Some of the women were for flitting forthwith and  climbing the down; but Master Ratsey, who was going round with others to  comfort people, soon showed us that the upper part of the village stood  so high, that if the water was to get thither, there was no knowing if it  would not cover Ridgedown itself. But what with its being a spring-tide,  and the sea breaking clean over the great outer beach of pebbles--a thing  that had not happened for fifty years--there was so much water piled up  in the lagoon, that it passed its bounds and flooded all the sea meadows,  and even the lower end of the street. So when day broke, there was the  churchyard flooded, though 'twas on rising ground, and the church itself  standing up like a steep little island, and the water over the door-sill  of the Why Not?, though Elzevir Block would not budge, saying he did not  care if the sea swept him away. It was but a nine-hours' wonder, for the  wind fell very suddenly; the water began to go back, the sun shone  bright, and before noon people came out to the doors to see the floods  and talk over the storm. Most said that never had been so fierce a wind,  but some of the oldest spoke of one in the second year of Queen Anne, and  would have it as bad or worse. But whether worse or not, this storm was a  weighty matter enough for me, and turned the course of my life, as you  shall hear.    I have said that the waters came up so high that the church stood out  like an island; but they went back quickly, and Mr. Glennie was able to  hold service on the next Sunday morning. Few enough folks came to  Moonfleet Church at any time; but fewer still came that morning, for  the meadows between the village and the churchyard were wet and miry  from the water. There were streamers of seaweed tangled about the very  tombstones, and against the outside of the churchyard wall was piled up  a great bank of it, from which came a salt rancid smell like a  guillemot's egg that is always in the air after a south-westerly gale  has strewn the shore with wrack.    This church is as large as any other I have seen, and divided into two  parts with a stone screen across the middle. Perhaps Moonfleet was once a  large place, and then likely enough there were people to fill such a  church, but never since I knew it did anyone worship in that part called  the nave. This western portion was quite empty beyond a few old tombs and  a Royal Arms of Queen Anne; the pavement too was damp and mossy; and  there were green patches down the white walls where the rains had got in.  So the handful of people that came to church were glad enough to get the  other side of the screen in the chancel, where at least the pew floors  were boarded over, and the panelling of oak-work kept off the draughts.    Now this Sunday morning there were only three or four, I think, beside  Mr. Glennie and Ratsey and the half-dozen of us boys, who crossed the  swampy meadows strewn with drowned shrew-mice and moles. Even my aunt was  not at church, being prevented by a migraine, but a surprise waited those  who did go, for there in a pew by himself sat Elzevir Block. The people  stared at him as they came in, for no one had ever known him go to church  before; some saying in the village that he was a Catholic, and others an  infidel. However that may be, there he was this day, wishing perhaps to  show a favour to the parson who had written the verses for David's  headstone. He took no notice of anyone, nor exchanged greetings with  those that came in, as was the fashion in Moonfleet Church, but kept his  eyes fixed on a prayer-book which he held in his hand, though he could  not be following the minister, for he never turned the leaf.    The church was so damp from the floods, that Master Ratsey had put a fire  in the brazier which stood at the back, but was not commonly lighted till  the winter had fairly begun. We boys sat as close to the brazier as we  could, for the wet cold struck up from the flags, and besides that, we  were so far from the clergyman, and so well screened by the oak backs,  that we could bake an apple or roast a chestnut without much fear of  being caught. But that morning there was something else to take off our  thoughts; for before the service was well begun, we became aware of a  strange noise under the church. The first time it came was just as Mr.  Glennie was"]]]
