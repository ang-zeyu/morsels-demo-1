Here is Northwest Smith, in a rare moment of      peace, in a remarkable vignette, published here by permission of the      author._        song      in       a   minor     key     _by ... C. L. MOORE_       He had been promising himself this moment for how   many lonely months and years on alien worlds?      Beneath him the clovered hill-slope was warm in the sun. Northwest Smith  moved his shoulders against the earth and closed his eyes, breathing so  deeply that the gun holstered upon his chest drew tight against its  strap as he drank the fragrance of Earth and clover warm in the sun.  Here in the hollow of the hills, willow-shaded, pillowed upon clover and  the lap of Earth, he let his breath run out in a long sigh and drew one  palm across the grass in a caress like a lover's.    He had been promising himself this moment for how long--how many months  and years on alien worlds? He would not think of it now. He would not  remember the dark spaceways or the red slag of Martian drylands or the  pearl-gray days on Venus when he had dreamed of the Earth that had  outlawed him. So he lay, with his eyes closed and the sunlight drenching  him through, no sound in his ears but the passage of a breeze through  the grass and a creaking of some insect nearby--the violent,  blood-smelling years behind him might never have been. Except for the  gun pressed into his ribs between his chest and the clovered earth, he  might be a boy again, years upon years ago, long before he had broken  his first law or killed his first man.    No one else alive now knew who that boy had been. Not even the all  knowing Patrol. Not even Venusian Yarol, who had been his closest friend  for so many riotous years. No one would ever know--now. Not his name  (which had not always been Smith) or his native land or the home that  had bred him, or the first violent deed that had sent him down the  devious paths which led here--here to the clover hollow in the hills of  an Earth that had forbidden him ever to set foot again upon her soil.    He unclasped the hands behind his head and rolled over to lay a scarred  cheek on his arm, smiling to himself. Well, here was Earth beneath him.  No longer a green star high in alien skies, but warm soil, new clover so  near his face he could see all the little stems and trefoil leaves,  moist earth granular at their roots. An ant ran by with waving antennae  close beside his cheek. He closed his eyes and drew another deep breath.  Better not even look; better to lie here like an animal, absorbing the  sun and the feel of Earth blindly, wordlessly.           *       *       *       *       *    Now he was not Northwest Smith, scarred outlaw of the spaceways. Now he  was a boy again with all his life before him. There would be a  white-columned house just over the hill, with shaded porches and white  curtains blowing in the breeze and the sound of sweet, familiar voices  indoors. There would be a girl with hair like poured honey hesitating  just inside the door, lifting her eyes to him. Tears in the eyes. He lay  very still, remembering.    Curious how vividly it all came back, though the house had been ashes  for nearly twenty years, and the girl--the girl ...    He rolled over violently, opening his eyes. No use remembering her.  There had been that fatal flaw in him from the very first, he knew now.  If he were the boy again knowing all he knew today, still the flaw would  be there and sooner or later the same thing must have happened that had  happened twenty years ago. He had been born for a wilder age, when men  took what they wanted and held what they could without respect for law.  Obedience was not in him, and so--    As vividly as on that day it happened he felt the same old surge of  anger and despair twenty years old now, felt the ray-gun bucking hard  against his unaccustomed fist, heard the hiss of its deadly charge  ravening into a face he hated. He could not be sorry, even now, for that  first man he had killed. But in the smoke of that killing had gone up  the columned house and the future he might have had, the boy  himself--lost as Atlantis now--and the girl with the honey-colored hair  and much, much else besides. It had to happen, he knew. He being the boy  he was, it had to happen. Even if he could go back and start all over,  the tale would be the same.    And it was all long past now, anyhow; and nobody remembered any more at  all, except himself. A man would be a fool to lie here thinking about it  any longer.    Smith grunted and sat up, shrugging the gun into place against his ribs.          Transcriber's Note:        This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1957.

He nodded in reply, and glanced at the woods behind furtively. I asked  him if he had seen or heard anything. He made no answer; but stood  silent, as though listening, and I kept quiet also.    Suddenly, he spoke.    \"Hark!\" he said, sharply. I looked at him, and then away among the trees  and bushes, holding my breath involuntarily. A minute came and went in  strained silence; yet I could hear nothing, and I turned to Tonnison to  say as much; and then, even as I opened my lips to speak, there came a  strange wailing noise out of the wood on our left.... It appeared to  float through the trees, and there was a rustle of stirring leaves, and  then silence.    All at once, Tonnison spoke, and put his hand on my shoulder. \"Let us  get out of here,\" he said, and began to move slowly toward where the  surrounding trees and bushes seemed thinnest. As I followed him, it came  to me suddenly that the sun was low, and that there was a raw sense of  chilliness in the air.    Tonnison said nothing further, but kept on steadily. We were among the  trees now, and I glanced around, nervously; but saw nothing, save the  quiet branches and trunks and the tangled bushes. Onward we went, and no  sound broke the silence, except the occasional snapping of a twig under  our feet, as we moved forward. Yet, in spite of the quietness, I had a  horrible feeling that we were not alone; and I kept so close to Tonnison  that twice I kicked his heels clumsily, though he said nothing. A  minute, and then another, and we reached the confines of the wood coming  out at last upon the bare rockiness of the countryside. Only then was I  able to shake off the haunting dread that had followed me among  the trees.    Once, as we moved away, there seemed to come again a distant sound of  wailing, and I said to myself that it was the wind--yet the evening was  breathless.    Presently, Tonnison began to talk.    \"Look you,\" he said with decision, \"I would not spend the night in  _that_ place for all the wealth that the world holds. There is something  unholy--diabolical--about it. It came to me all in a moment, just after  you spoke. It seemed to me that the woods were full of vile  things--you know!\"    \"Yes,\" I answered, and looked back toward the place; but it was hidden  from us by a rise in the ground.    \"There's the book,\" I said, and I put my hand into the satchel.    \"You've got it safely?\" he questioned, with a sudden access of anxiety.    \"Yes,\" I replied.    \"Perhaps,\" he continued, \"we shall learn something from it when we get  back to the tent. We had better hurry, too; we're a long way off still,  and I don't fancy, now, being caught out here in the dark.\"    It was two hours later when we reached the tent; and, without delay, we  set to work to prepare a meal; for we had eaten nothing since our lunch  at midday.    Supper over, we cleared the things out of the way, and lit our pipes.  Then Tonnison asked me to get the manuscript out of my satchel. This I  did, and then, as we could not both read from it at the same time, he  suggested that I should read the thing out loud. \"And mind,\" he  cautioned, knowing my propensities, \"don't go skipping half the book.\"    Yet, had he but known what it contained, he would have realized how  needless such advice was, for once at least. And there seated in the  opening of our little tent, I began the strange tale of _The House on  the Borderland_ (for such was the title of the MS.); this is told in the  following pages.        _II_    THE PLAIN OF SILENCE    I am an old man. I live here in this ancient house, surrounded by huge,  unkempt gardens.    The peasantry, who inhabit the wilderness beyond, say that I am mad.  That is because I will have nothing to do with them. I live here alone  with my old sister, who is also my housekeeper. We keep no servants--I  hate them. I have one friend, a dog; yes, I would sooner have old Pepper  than the rest of Creation together. He, at least, understands me--and  has sense enough to leave me alone when I am in my dark moods.    I have decided to start a kind of diary; it may enable me to record  some of the thoughts and feelings that I cannot express to anyone; but,  beyond this, I am anxious to make some record of the strange things that  I have heard and seen, during many years of loneliness, in this weird  old building.    For a couple of centuries, this house has had a reputation, a bad one,  and, until I bought it, for more than eighty years no one had lived  here; consequently, I got the old place at a ridiculously low figure.    I am not superstitious; but I have ceased to deny that things happen  in this old house--things that I cannot explain; and, therefore, I must  needs ease my mind, by writing down an account of them, to the best of  my ability; though, should this, my diary, ever be read when I am gone,  the readers will but shake their heads, and be the more convinced that  I was mad.    This house, how ancient it is! though its age strikes one less,  perhaps, than the quaintness of its structure, which is curious and  fantastic to the last degree. Little curved towers and pinnacles, with  outlines suggestive of leaping flames, predominate; while the body of  the building is in the form of a circle.    I have heard that there is an old story, told amongst the country  people, to the effect that the devil built the place. However, that is  as may be. True or not, I neither know nor care, save as it may have  helped to cheapen it, ere I came.    I must have been here some ten years before I saw sufficient to warrant  any belief in the stories, current in the neighborhood, about this  house. It is true that I had, on at least a dozen occasions, seen,  vaguely, things that puzzled me, and, perhaps, had felt more than I had  seen. Then, as the years passed, bringing age upon me, I became often  aware of something unseen, yet unmistakably present, in the empty rooms  and corridors. Still, it was as I have said many years before I saw any  real manifestations of the so-called supernatural.    It was not Halloween. If I were telling a story for amusement's sake, I  should probably place it on that night of nights; but this is a true  record of my own experiences, and I would not put pen to paper to amuse  anyone. No. It was after midnight on the morning of the twenty-first day  of January. I was sitting reading, as is often my custom, in my study.  Pepper lay, sleeping, near my chair.    Without warning, the flames of the two candles went low, and then  shone with a ghastly green effulgence. I looked up, quickly, and as I  did so I saw the lights sink into a dull, ruddy tint; so that the room  glowed with a strange, heavy, crimson twilight that gave the shadows  behind the chairs and tables a double depth of blackness; and wherever  the light struck, it was as though luminous blood had been splashed  over the room.    Down on the floor, I heard a faint, frightened whimper, and something  pressed itself in between my two feet. It was Pepper, cowering under my  dressing gown. Pepper, usually as brave as a lion!    It was this movement of the dog's, I think, that gave me the first  twinge of _real_ fear. I had been considerably startled when the lights  burnt first green and then red; but had been momentarily under the  impression that the change was due to some influx of noxious gas into  the room. Now, however, I saw that it was not so; for the candles burned  with a steady flame, and showed no signs of going out, as would have  been the case had the change been due to fumes in the atmosphere.    I did not move. I felt distinctly frightened; but could think of  nothing better to do than wait. For perhaps a minute, I kept my glance  about the room, nervously. Then I noticed that the lights had commenced  to sink, very slowly; until presently they showed minute specks of red  fire, like the gleamings of rubies in the darkness. Still, I sat  watching; while a sort of dreamy indifference seemed to steal over me;  banishing altogether the fear that had begun to grip me.    Away in the far end of the huge old-fashioned room, I became conscious  of a faint glow. Steadily it grew, filling the room with gleams of  quivering green light; then they sank quickly, and changed--even as the  candle flames had done--into a deep, somber crimson that strengthened,  and lit up the room with a flood of awful glory.    The light came from the end wall, and grew ever brighter until its  intolerable glare caused my eyes acute pain, and involuntarily I closed  them. It may have been a few seconds before I was able to open them. The  first thing I noticed was that the light had decreased, greatly; so that  it no longer tried my eyes. Then, as it grew still duller, I was aware,  all at once, that, instead of looking at the redness, I was staring  through it, and through the wall beyond.    Gradually, as I became more accustomed to the idea, I realized that I  was looking out on to a vast plain, lit with the same gloomy twilight  that pervaded the room. The immensity of this plain scarcely can be  conceived. In no part could I perceive its confines. It seemed to  broaden and spread out, so that the eye failed to perceive any  limitations. Slowly, the details of the nearer portions began to grow  clear; then, in a moment almost, the light died away, and the vision--if  vision it were--faded and was gone.    Suddenly, I became conscious that I was no longer in the chair.  Instead, I seemed to be hovering above it, and looking down at a dim  something, huddled and silent. In a little while, a cold blast struck  me, and I was outside in the night, floating, like a bubble, up through  the darkness. As I moved, an icy coldness seemed to enfold me, so that  I shivered.    After a time, I looked to right and left, and saw the intolerable  blackness of the night, pierced by remote gleams of fire. Onward,  outward, I drove. Once, I glanced behind, and saw the"]]]
