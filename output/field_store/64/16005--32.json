In 405 Sophocles showed in his last play how Oedipus passed from earth  in the poet's own birthplace, Colonus. Oedipus enters with Antigone,  and on inquiry from a stranger finds that he is on the demesne of the  Eumenides. At once he sends to Theseus, King of Athens, and refuses to  move from the spot, for there he is fated to find his rest. A Chorus  from Colonus comes to find out who the suppliant is. When they hear the  name of Oedipus they are horror-struck and wish to thrust him out. After  much persuasion they consent to wait till Theseus arrives. Presently  Ismene comes with the news that Eteocles has dispossessed his elder  brother Polyneices; further, an oracle from Delphi declares that Oedipus  is all-important to Thebes in life and after death. His sons know this  oracle and Creon is coming to force him back. Declaring he will do  nothing for the sons who abandoned him, Oedipus obstinately refuses  his city any blessing. He sends Ismene to offer a sacrifice to the  Eumenides; in her absence Theseus enters, offers him protection and asks  why he has come. Oedipus replies that he has a secret to reveal which is  of great importance to Athens; at present there is peace between her and  Thebes:        \"but in the gods alone is no age or death; all else Time confounds,      mastering everything. Strength of the Earth and of the body wastes,      trust dies, disloyalty grows, the same spirit never stands firm      among friends or allies. To some men early, to others late,      pleasures become bitter and then again sweet.\"    The secret Oedipus will impart at the proper time. The need for  protection soon comes. Creon attempts to persuade Oedipus to return to  Thebes but is met by a curse, whereupon the Theban guards lay hold of  Antigone--they had already seized Ismene--and menace Oedipus himself.  Theseus hearing the alarm rushes back, reproaches Creon for his  insolence and quickly returns with the two girls. He has strange news to  tell; another Theban is a suppliant at the altar of Poseidon close by,  craving speech with Oedipus. It is Polyneices, whom Antigone persuades  her father to interview. The youth enters, ashamed of his neglect of his  father, and begs a blessing on the army he has mustered against Thebes.  He is met by a terrible curse which Oedipus invokes on both his sons. In  despair Polyneices goes away to his doom.        \"For me, my path shall be one of care, disaster and sorrows sent me      by my sire and his guardian angels; but, my sisters, be yours a      happy road, and when I am dead fulfil my heart's desire, for while      I live you may never perform it.\"    A thunderstorm is heard approaching; the Chorus are terrified at its  intensity, but Oedipus eagerly dispatches a messenger for Theseus.  When the King arrives he hears the secret; Oedipus' grave would be the  eternal protection of Attica, but no man must know its site save Theseus  who has to tell it to his heir alone, and he to his son, and so onwards  for ever. The proof of Oedipus' word would be a miracle which soon would  transform him back to his full strength. Presently he arises, endued  with a mysterious sight, beckoning the others to follow him. The play  concludes with a magnificent description of his translation. A voice  from Heaven called him, chiding him for tarrying; commending his  daughters to the care of Theseus, he greeted the earth and heaven in  prayer and then without pain or sorrow passed away. On reappearing  Theseus promised to convey the sisters back to Thebes and to stop the  threatened fratricidal strife.    The _Oedipus Coloneus_, like the _Philoctetes_, the other play of  Sophocles' old age, closes in peace. The old fiery passions still burn  fiercely in Oedipus, as they did in Lear; yet both were \"every inch a  king\" and \"more sinned against than sinning\". Oedipus' miraculous  return to strength before he departs is curiously like the famous end  of Colonel Newcome. There are subtle but unmistakable marks of the  Euripidean influence on this drama; such are the belief that Theban  worthies would protect Athens, the Theseus tradition, and the recovery  of worn-out strength. These features will meet us in the next chapter.  But it is again noteworthy that Sophocles has added those touches which  distinguish his own firm and delicate handiwork. There is nothing  of melodrama, nothing inconsequent, nothing exaggerated. It is the  dramatist's preparation for his own end. Shakespeare put his valediction  into the mouth of Prospero; Sophocles entrusted his to his greatest  creation Oedipus. Like him, he was fain to depart, for the gods called.  Our last sight of him is of one beckoning us to follow him to the place  where calm is to be found; to find it we must use not the eyes of the  body, but the inward illumination vouchsafed by Heaven.    To the Athenians of the Periclean age Sophocles was the incarnation  of their dramatic ideal. His language is a delight and a despair. It  tantalises; it suggests other meanings besides its plain and surface  significance. This riddling quality is the daemonic element which he  possessed in common with Plato; because of it these two are the masters  of a refined and subtle irony, a source of the keenest pleasure. His  plots reveal a vivid sense of the exact moment which will yield the  intensest tragic effects--only on one particular day could Ajax die or  Electra be saved. Accordingly, Sophocles very often begins his play  with early dawn, in order to fill the few all-important hours with the  greatest possible amount of action. He has put the maximum of movement  into his work, only the presence ofthe Chorus and the conventional  messengers (two features imposed on him by the law of the Attic theatre)  making the action halt.    But it is in the sum-total of his art that his greatness lies; the sense  of a whole is its controlling factor; details are important, indeed,  he took the utmost pains to see that they were necessary and  convincing--yet they were details, subordinate, closely related, not  irrelevant nor disproportionate. This instinct for a definite plan  first is the essence of the classical spirit; exuberance is rigorously  repressed, symmetry and balance are the first, last and only aim. To  some judges Sophocles is like a Greek temple, splendid but a little  chilly; they miss the soaring ambition of Aeschylus or the more direct  emotional appeal of Euripides. Yet it is a cardinal error to imagine  that Sophocles is passionless; his life was not, neither are his  characters. Like the lava of a recent eruption, they may seem ashen on  the surface, but there is fire underneath; it betrays itself through the  cracks which appear when their substance is violently disturbed.      They, much enforced, show a hasty spark    And straight are cold again.    Repression, avoidance of extremes, dignity under provocation are the  marks of the gentle Sophoclean type and it is a very high type indeed.    For we have in him the very fountain of the whole classical tradition in  drama. Sophocles is something far more important than a mere influence;  he is an ideal, and as such is indestructible. To ask the names of  writers who came most under his \"influence\" is as sensible as to ask the  names of the sculptors who most faithfully followed the Greek tradition  of statuary. He is Classical tragedy. The main body of Spanish and  English drama is romantic, the Sophoclean ideal is that of the small  but powerful body of University men in Elizabeth's time headed by  Ben Jonson, of the typically French school of dramatists, of  Moratin, Lessing, Goethe, of the exponents of the Greek creed in  nineteenth-century England, notably Matthew Arnold and Walter Pater,  and of Robert Bridges. To this school the cultivation of emotional  expression is suspicious, if not dangerous; it leads to eccentricity, to  the revelation of feelings which frequently are not worth experiencing,  to sentimental flabbiness, to riot and extravagance. Perhaps in dread of  the ridiculous the Classical school represses itself too far, creating  characters of marble instead of flesh. These creations are at least  worth looking at and bring no shame; they are better than the spectral  psychological studies which many dramatists, now dead or dying, have  bidden us believe are real men and women.

There has come down to us a remarkable tragedy, called the _Rhesus_,  about a similar region. It treats first of the Dolon incident of the  Iliad. Hector sent out Dolon to reconnoitre, and soon afterwards some  Phrygian shepherds bring news that Rhesus has arrived that very night  with a Thracian army. Reviled by Hector for postponing his arrival  till the tenth year of the war, Rhesus answers that continual wars  with Scythia have occupied him, but now that he is come he will end the  strife in a day. He is assigned his quarters and departs to take up his  position.    Having learned the password from Dolon, Diomedes and Odysseus enter and  reach the tents of Hector who has just left with Rhesus. Diomedes is  eager to kill Aeneas or Paris or some other leader, but Odysseus  warns him to be content with the spoils they have won. Athena appears,  counselling them to slay Rhesus; if he survives that night, neither  Achilles nor Ajax can save the Greeks. Paris approaches, having heard  that spies are abroad in the night; he is beguiled by Athena who  pretends to be Aphrodite. When he is safely got away, the two slay  Rhesus.

They fell away, though slowly, and slowly the voter saw a wider  world and the wonder of the sea. And the afternoon wore on, and the winter  evening came, and the night fell, and all black grew the sea, and about  the time that the stars come blinking out to look upon our littleness, the  polling-booth closed in the town.    When they got back the turmoil was on the wane in the streets; night hid  the glare of the posters; and the tide, finding the noise abated and being  at the flow, told an old tale that he had learned in his youth about the  deeps of the sea, the same which he had told to coastwise ships that  brought it to Babylon by the way of Euphrates before the doom of Troy.    I blame my friend the poet, however lonely he was, for preventing this man  from registering his vote (the duty of every citizen); but perhaps it  matters less, as it was a foregone conclusion, because the losing  candidate, either through poverty or sheer madness, had neglected to  subscribe to a single football club.          THE UNHAPPY BODY      \"Why do you not dance with us and rejoice with us?\" they said to a certain  body. And then that body made the confession of its trouble. It said: \"I  am united with a fierce and violent soul, that is altogether tyrannous and  will not let me rest, and he drags me away from the dances of my kin to  make me toil at his detestable work; and he will not let me do the little  things, that would give pleasure to the folk I love, but only cares to  please posterity when he has done with me and left me to the worms; and  all the while he makes absurd demands of affection from those that are  near to me, and is too proud even to notice any less than he demands, so  that those that should be kind to me all hate me.\" And the unhappy body  burst into tears.    And they said: \"No sensible body cares for its soul. A soul is a little  thing, and should not rule a body. You should drink and smoke more till he  ceases to trouble you.\" But the body only wept, and said, \"Mine is a  fearful soul. I have driven him away for a little while with drink. But he  will soon come back. Oh, he will soon come back!\"    And the body went to bed hoping to rest, for it was drowsy with drink. But  just as sleep was near it, it looked up, and there was its soul sitting on  the windowsill, a misty blaze of light, and looking into the river.    \"Come,\" said the tyrannous soul, \"and look into the street.\"    \"I have need of sleep,\" said the body.    \"But the street is a beautiful thing,\" the soul said vehemently; \"a  hundred of the people are dreaming there.\"    \"I am ill through want of rest,\" the body said.    \"That does not matter,\" the soul said to it. \"There are millions like you  in the earth, and millions more to go there. The people's dreams are  wandering afield; they pass the seas and mountains of faery, threading the  intricate passes led by their souls; they come to golden temples a-ring  with a thousand bells; they pass up steep streets lit by paper lanterns,  where the doors are green and small; they know their way to witches'  chambers and castles of enchantment; they know the spell that brings them  to the causeway along the ivory mountains--on one side looking downward  they behold the fields of their youth and on the other lie the radiant  plains of the future. Arise and write down what the people dream.\"    \"What reward is there for me,\" said the body, \"if I write down what you  bid me?\"    \"There is no reward,\" said the soul.    \"Then I shall sleep,\" said the body.    And the soul began to hum an idle song sung by a young man in a fabulous  land as he passed a golden city (where fiery sentinels stood), and knew  that his wife was within it, though as yet but a little child, and knew by  prophecy that furious wars, not yet arisen in far and unknown mountains,  should roll above him with their dust and thirst before he ever came to  that city again--the young man sang it as he passed the gate, and was now  dead with his wife a thousand years.    \"I cannot sleep for that abominable song,\" the body cried to the soul.    \"Then do as you are commanded,\" the soul replied. And wearily the body  took a pen again. Then the soul spoke merrily as he looked through the  window. \"There is a mountain lifting sheer above London, part crystal and  part myst. Thither the dreamers go when the sound of the traffic has  fallen. At first they scarcely dream because of the roar of it, but before  midnight it stops, and turns, and ebbs with all its wrecks. Then the  dreamers arise and scale the shimmering mountain, and at its summit find  the galleons of dream. Thence some sail East, some West, some into the  Past and some into the Future, for the galleons sail over the years as  well as over the spaces, but mostly they head for the Past and the olden  harbours, for thither the sighs of men are mostly turned, and the  dream-ships go before them, as the merchantmen before the continual  trade-winds go down the African coast. I see the galleons even now raise  anchor after anchor; the stars flash by them; they slip out of the night;  their prows go gleaming into the twilight of memory, and night soon lies  far off, a black cloud hanging low, and faintly spangled with stars, like  the harbour and shore of some low-lying land seen afar with its harbour  lights.\"    Dream after dream that soul related as he sat there by the window. He told  of tropical forests seen by unhappy men who could not escape from London,  and never would--forests made suddenly wondrous by the song of some  passing bird flying to unknown eyries and singing an unknown song. He saw  the old men lightly dancing to the tune of elfin pipes--beautiful dances  with fantastic maidens--all night on moonlit imaginary mountains; he heard  far off the music of glittering Springs; he saw the fairness of blossoms  of apple and may thirty years fallen; he heard old voices--old tears came  glistening back; Romance sat cloaked and crowned upon southern hills, and  the soul knew him.    One by one he told the dreams of all that slept in that street. Sometimes  he stopped to revile the body because it worked badly and slowly. Its  chill fingers wrote as fast as they could, but the soul cared not for  that. And so the night wore on till the soul heard tinkling in Oriental  skies far footfalls of the morning.    \"See now,\" said the soul, \"the dawn that the dreamers dread. The sails of  light are paling on those unwreckable galleons; the mariners that steer  them slip back into fable and myth; that other sea the traffic is turning  now at its ebb, and is about to hide its pallid wrecks, and to come  swinging back, with its tumult, at the flow. Already the sunlight flashes  in the gulfs behind the east of the world; the gods have seen it from  their palace of twilight that the built above the sunrise; they warm their  hands at its glow as it streams through their gleaming arches, before it  reaches the world; all the gods are there that have ever been, and all the  gods that shall be; they sit there in the morning, chanting and praising  Man.\"    \"I am numb and very cold for want of sleep,\" said the body.    \"You shall have centuries of sleep,\" said the soul, \"but you must not  sleep now, for I have seen deep meadows with purple flowers flaming tall  and strange above the brilliant grass, and herds of pure white unicorns  that gambol there for joy, and a river running by with a glittering  galleon on it, all of gold, that goes from an unknown inland to an unknown  isle of the sea to take a song from the King of Over-the-Hills to the  Queen of Far-Away.    \"I will sing that song to you, and you shall write it down.\"    \"I have toiled for you for years,\" the body said. \"Give me now but one  night's rest, for I am exceeding weary.\"    \"Oh, go and rest. I am tired of you. I am off,\" said the soul.    And he arose and went, we know not whither. But the body they laid in the  earth. And the next night at midnight the wraiths of the dead came  drifting from their tombs to felicitate that body.    \"You are free here, you know,\" they said to their new companion.    \"Now I can rest,\" said the body."]]]
