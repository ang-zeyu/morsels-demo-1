He had told all the people in the settlement,  to many of whom Betty was unknown, that she could ride like an  Indian and shoot with undoubted skill; that she had a generous share  of the Zanes' fleetness of foot, and that she would send a canoe  over as bad a place as she could find. The boasts of the Colonel  remained as yet unproven, but, be that as it may, Betty had,  notwithstanding her many faults, endeared herself to all. She made  sunshine and happiness everywhere; the old people loved her; the  children adored her, and the broad shouldered, heavy footed young  settlers were shy and silent, yet blissfully happy in her presence.    \"Betty, will you fill my pipe?\" asked the Colonel, when he had  finished his supper and had pulled his big chair nearer the fire.  His oldest child, Noah, a sturdy lad of six, climbed upon his knee  and plied him with questions.    \"Did you see any bars and bufflers?\" he asked, his eyes large and  round.    \"No, my lad, not one.\"    \"How long will it be until I am big enough to go?\"    \"Not for a very long time, Noah.\"    \"But I am not afraid of Betty's bar. He growls at me when I throw  sticks at him, and snaps his teeth. Can I go with you next time?\"    \"My brother came over from Short Creek to-day. He has been to Fort  Pitt,\" interposed Mrs. Zane. As she was speaking a tap sounded on  the door, which, being opened by Betty, disclosed Captain Boggs his  daughter Lydia, and Major Samuel McColloch, the brother of Mrs.  Zane.    \"Ah, Colonel! I expected to find you at home to-night. The weather  has been miserable for hunting and it is not getting any better. The  wind is blowing from the northwest and a storm is coming,\" said  Captain Boggs, a fine, soldierly looking man.    \"Hello, Captain! How are you? Sam, I have not had the pleasure of  seeing you for a long time,\" replied Colonel Zane, as he shook hands  with his guests.    Major McColloch was the eldest of the brothers of that name. As an  Indian killer he ranked next to the intrepid Wetzel; but while  Wetzel preferred to take his chances alone and track the Indians  through the untrodden wilds, McColloch was a leader of expeditions  against the savages. A giant in stature, massive in build, bronzed  and bearded, he looked the typical frontiersman. His blue eyes were  like those of his sister and his voice had the same pleasant ring.    \"Major McColloch, do you remember me?\" asked Betty.    \"Indeed I do,\" he answered, with a smile. \"You were a little girl,  running wild, on the Potomac when I last saw you!\"    \"Do you remember when you used to lift me on your horse and give me  lessons in riding?\"    \"I remember better than you. How you used to stick on the back of  that horse was a mystery to me.\"    \"Well, I shall be ready soon to go on with those lessons in riding.  I have heard of your wonderful leap over the hill and I should like  to have you tell me all about it. Of all the stories I have heard  since I arrived at Fort Henry, the one of your ride and leap for  life is the most wonderful.\"    \"Yes, Sam, she will bother you to death about that ride, and will  try to give you lessons in leaping down precipices. I should not be  at all surprised to find her trying to duplicate your feat. You know  the Indian pony I got from that fur trader last summer. Well, he is  as wild as a deer and she has been riding him without his being  broken,\" said Colonel Zane.    \"Some other time I shall tell you about my jump over the hill. Just  now I have important matters to discuss,\" answered the Major to  Betty.    It was evident that something unusual had occurred, for after  chatting a few moments the three men withdrew into the magazine room  and conversed in low, earnest tones.    Lydia Boggs was eighteen, fair haired and blue eyed. Like Betty she  had received a good education, and, in that respect, was superior to  the border girls, who seldom knew more than to keep house and to  make linen. At the outbreak of the Indian wars General Clark had  stationed Captain Boggs at Fort Henry and Lydia had lived there with  him two years. After Betty's arrival, which she hailed with delight,  the girls had become fast friends.    Lydia slipped her arm affectionately around Betty's neck and said,  \"Why did you not come over to the Fort to-day?\"    \"It has been such an ugly day, so disagreeable altogether, that I  have remained indoors.\"    \"You missed something,\" said Lydia, knowingly.    \"What do you mean? What did I miss?\"    \"Oh, perhaps, after all, it will not interest you.\"    \"How provoking! Of course it will. Anything or anybody would  interest me to-night. Do tell me, please.\"    \"It isn't much. Only a young soldier came over with Major  McColloch.\"    \"A soldier? From Fort Pitt? Do I know him? I have met most of the  officers.\"    \"No, you have never seen him. He is a stranger to all of us.\"    \"There does not seem to be so much in your news,\" said Betty, in a  disappointed tone. \"To be sure, strangers are a rarity in our little  village, but, judging from the strangers who have visited us in the  past, I imagine this one cannot be much different.\"    \"Wait until you see him,\" said Lydia, with a serious little nod of  her head.    \"Come, tell me all about him,\" said Betty, now much interested.    \"Major McColloch brought him in to see papa, and he was introduced  to me. He is a southerner and from one of those old families. I  could tell by his cool, easy, almost reckless air. He is handsome,  tall and fair, and his face is frank and open. He has such beautiful  manners. He bowed low to me and really I felt so embarrassed that I  hardly spoke. You know I am used to these big hunters seizing your  hand and giving it a squeeze which makes you want to scream. Well,  this young man is different. He is a cavalier. All the girls are in  love with him already. So will you be.\"    \"I? Indeed not. But how refreshing. You must have been strongly  impressed to see and remember all you have told me.\"    \"Betty Zane, I remember so well because he is just the man you  described one day when we were building castles and telling each  other what kind of a hero we wanted.\"    \"Girls, do not talk such nonsense,\" interrupted the Colonel's wife  who was perturbed by the colloquy in the other room. She had seen  those ominous signs before. \"Can you find nothing better to talk  about?\"    Meanwhile Colonel Zane and his companions were earnestly discussing  certain information which had arrived that day. A friendly Indian  runner had brought news to Short Creek, a settlement on the river  between Fort Henry and Fort Pitt of an intended raid by the Indians  all along the Ohio valley. Major McColloch, who had been warned by  Wetzel of the fever of unrest among the Indians--a fever which broke  out every spring--had gone to Fort Pitt with the hope of bringing  back reinforcements, but, excepting the young soldier, who had  volunteered to return with him, no help could he enlist, so he  journeyed back post-haste to Fort Henry.    The information he brought disturbed Captain Boggs, who commanded  the garrison, as a number of men were away on a logging expedition  up the river, and were not expected to raft down to the Fort for two  weeks.    Jonathan Zane, who had been sent for, joined the trio at this  moment, and was acquainted with the particulars. The Zane brothers  were always consulted where any question concerning Indian craft and  cunning was to be decided. Colonel Zane had a strong friendly  influence with certain tribes, and his advice was invaluable.  Jonathan Zane hated the sight of an Indian and except for his  knowledge as a scout, or Indian tracker or fighter, he was of little  use in a council. Colonel Zane informed the men of the fact that  Wetzel and he had discovered Indian tracks within ten miles of the  Fort, and he dwelt particularly on the disappearance of Wetzel.    \"Now, you can depend on what I say. There are Wyandots in force on  the war path. Wetzel told me to dig for the Fort and he left me in a  hurry. We were near that cranberry bog over at the foot of Bald  mountain. I do not believe we shall be attacked. In my opinion the  Indians would come up from the west and keep to the high ridges  along Yellow creek. They always come that way. But of course, it is  best to know surely, and I daresay Lew will come in to-night or  to-morrow with the facts. In the meantime put out some scouts back  in the woods and let Jonathan and the Major watch the river.\"    \"I hope Wetzel will come in,\" said the Major. \"We can trust him to  know more about the Indians than any one. It was a week before you  and he went hunting that I saw him. I went to Fort Pitt and tried to  bring over some men, but the garrison is short and they need men as  much as we do. A young soldier named Clarke volunteered to come and  I brought him along with me. He has not seen any Indian fighting,  but he is a likely looking chap, and I guess will do. Captain Boggs  will give him a place in the block house if you say so.\"    \"By all means. We shall be glad to have him,\" said Colonel Zane.    \"It would not be so serious if I had not sent the men up the river,\"  said Captain Boggs, in anxious tones. \"Do you think it possible they  might have fallen in with the Indians?\"    \"It is possible, of course, but not probable,\" answered Colonel  Zane. \"The Indians are all across the Ohio. Wetzel is over there and  he will get here long before they do.\"    \"I hope it may be as you say. I have much confidence in your  judgment,\" returned Captain Boggs. \"I shall put out scouts and take  all the precaution possible. We must return now. Come, Lydia.\"    \"Whew! What an awful night this is going to be,\" said Colonel Zane,  when he had closed the door after his guests' departure. \"I should  not care to sleep out to-night.\"    \"Eb, what will "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#3)"],[1,"gust's greeting,  and Martin was not the same man who had shown fear on the desert. His  welcome was one of respectful regard for his superior.    \"Elder, I heard you were safe in,\" he said, fervently. \"We feared--I  know not what. I was distressed till I got the news of your arrival.  How's the young man?\"    \"He's very ill. But while there's life there's hope.\"    \"Will the Bishop administer to him?\"    \"Gladly, if the young man's willing. Come, let's go in.\"    \"Wait, August,\" said Cole. \"Did you know your son Snap was in the  village?\"    \"My son here!\" August Naab betrayed anxiety. \"I left him home with work.  He shouldn't have come. Is--is he--\"    \"He's drinking and in an ugly mood. It seems he traded horses with Jeff  Larsen, and got the worst of the deal. There's pretty sure to be a  fight.\"    \"He always hated Larsen.\"    \"Small wonder. Larsen is mean; he's as bad as we've got and that's  saying a good deal. Snap has done worse things than fight with Larsen.  He's doing a worse thing now, August--he's too friendly with Dene.\"    \"I've heard--I've heard it before. But, Martin, what can I do?\"    \"Do? God knows. What can any of us do? Times have changed, August. Dene  is here in White Sage, free, welcome in many homes. Some of our  neighbors, perhaps men we trust, are secret members of this rustler's  band.\"    \"You're right, Cole. There are Mormons who are cattle-thieves. To my  eternal shame I confess it. Under cover of night they ride with Dene,  and here in our midst they meet him in easy tolerance. Driven from  Montana he comes here to corrupt our young men. God's mercy!\"    \"August, some of our young men need no one to corrupt them. Dene had no  great task to win them. He rode in here with a few outlaws and now he  has a strong band. We've got to face it. We haven't any law, but he can  be killed. Some one must kill him. Yet bad as Dene is, he doesn't  threaten our living as Holderness does. Dene steals a few cattle, kills  a man here and there. Holderness reaches out and takes our springs.  Because we've no law to stop him, he steals the blood of our life--  water--water--God's gift to the desert! Some one must kill Holderness,  too!\"    \"Martin, this lust to kill is a fearful thing. Come in, you must pray  with the Bishop.\"    \"No, it's not prayer I need, Elder,\" replied Cole, stubbornly. \"I'm  still a good Mormon. What I want is the stock I've lost, and my fields  green again.\"    August Naab had no answer for his friend. A very old man with snow-white  hair and beard came out on the porch.    \"Bishop, brother Martin is railing again,\" said Naab, as Cole bared his  head.    \"Martin, my son, unbosom thyself,\" rejoined the Bishop.    \"Black doubt and no light,\" said Cole, despondently. \"I'm of the younger  generation of Mormons, and faith is harder for me. I see signs you can't  see. I've had trials hard to bear. I was rich in cattle, sheep, and  water. These Gentiles, this rancher Holderness and this outlaw Dene,  have driven my cattle, killed my sheep, piped my water off my fields. I  don't like the present. We are no longer in the old days. Our young men  are drifting away, and the few who return come with ideas opposed to  Mormonism. Our girls and boys are growing up influenced by the Gentiles  among us. They intermarry, and that's a death-blow to our creed.\"    \"Martin, cast out this poison from your heart. Return to your faith. The  millennium will come. Christ will reign on earth again. The ten tribes  of Israel will be restored. The Book of Mormon is the Word of God. The  creed will live. We may suffer here and die, but our spirits will go  marching on; and the City of Zion will be builded over our graves.\"    Cole held up his hands in a meekness that signified hope if not faith.    August Naab bent over Hare. \"I would like to have the Bishop administer  to you,\" he said.    \"What's that?\" asked Hare.    \"A Mormon custom, 'the laying on of hands.' We know its efficacy in  trouble and illness. A Bishop of the Mormon Church has the gift of  tongues, of prophecy, of revelation, of healing. Let him administer to  you. It entails no obligation. Accept it as a prayer.\"    \"I'm willing,\" replied the young man.    Thereupon Naab spoke a few low words to some one through the open door.  Voices ceased; soft footsteps sounded without; women crossed the  threshold, followed by tall young men and rosy-checked girls and round-  eyed children. A white-haired old woman came forward with solemn  dignity. She carried a silver bowl which she held for the Bishop as he  stood close by Hare's couch. The Bishop put his hands into the bowl,  anointing them with fragrant oil; then he placed them on the young man's  head, and offered up a brief prayer, beautiful in its simplicity and  tremulous utterance.    The ceremony ended, the onlookers came forward with pleasant words on  their lips, pleasant smiles on their faces. The children filed by his  couch, bashful yet sympathetic; the women murmured, the young men  grasped his hand. Mescal flitted by with downcast eye, with shy smile,  but no word.    \"Your fever is gone,\" said August Naab, with his hand on Hare's cheek.    \"It comes and goes suddenly,\" replied Hare. \"I feel better now, only I'm  oppressed. I can't breathe freely. I want air, and I'm hungry.\"    \"Mother Mary, the lad's hungry. Judith, Esther, where are your wits?  Help your mother. Mescal, wait on him, see to his comfort.\"    Mescal brought a little table and a pillow, and the other girls soon  followed with food and drink; then they hovered about, absorbed in  caring for him.    \"They said I fell among thieves,\" mused Hare, when he was once more  alone. \"I've fallen among saints as well.\" He felt that he could never  repay this August Naab. \"If only I might live!\" he ejaculated. How  restful was this cottage garden! The green sward was a balm to his eyes.  Flowers new to him, though of familiar springtime hue, lifted fresh  faces everywhere; fruit-trees, with branches intermingling, blended the  white and pink of blossoms. There was the soft laughter of children in  the garden. Strange birds darted among the trees. Their notes were new,  but their song was the old delicious monotone--the joy of living and  love of spring. A green-bowered irrigation ditch led by the porch and  unseen water flowed gently, with gurgle and tinkle, with music in its  hurry. Innumerable bees murmured amid the blossoms.    Hare fell asleep. Upon returning drowsily to consciousness he caught  through half-open eyes the gleam of level shafts of gold sunlight low  down in the trees; then he felt himself being carried into the house to  be laid upon a bed. Some one gently unbuttoned his shirt at the neck,  removed his shoes, and covered him with a blanket. Before he had fully  awakened he was left alone, and quiet settled over the house. A  languorous sense of ease and rest lulled him to sleep again. In another  moment, it seemed to him, he was awake; bright daylight streamed through  the window, and a morning breeze stirred the faded curtain.    The drag in his breathing which was always a forerunner of a coughing-  spell warned him now; he put on coat and shoes and went outside, where  his cough attacked him, had its sway, and left him.    \"Good-morning,\" sang out August Naab's cheery voice. \"Sixteen hours of  sleep, my lad!\"    \"I did sleep, didn't I? No wonder I feel well this morning. A  peculiarity of my illness is that one day I'm down, the next day up.\"    \"With the goodness of God, my lad, we'll gradually increase the days up.  Go in to breakfast. Afterward I want to talk to you. This'll be a busy  day for me, shoeing the horses and packing supplies. I want to start for  home to-morrow.\"    Hare pondered over Naab's words while he ate. The suggestion in them,  implying a relation to his future, made him wonder if the good Mormon  intended to take him to his desert home. He hoped so, and warmed anew to  this friend. But he had no enthusiasm for himself; his future seemed  hopeless.    Naab was waiting for him on the porch, and drew him away from the  cottage down the path toward the gate.    \"I want you to go home with me.\"    \"You're kind--I'm only a sort of beggar--I've no strength left to work  my way. I'll go--though it's only to die.\"    \"I haven't the gift of revelation--yet somehow I see that you won't die  of this illness. You will come home with me. It's a beautiful place, my  Navajo oasis. The Indians call it the Garden of Eschtah. If you can get  well anywhere it'll be there.\"    \"I'll go but I ought not. What can I do for you?\"    \"No man can ever tell what he may do for another. The time may come--  well, John, is it settled?\" He offered his huge broad hand.    \"It's settled--I--\" Hare faltered as he put his hand in Naab's. The  Mormon's grip straightened his frame and braced him. Strength and  simplicity flowed from the giant's toil-hardened palm. Hare swallowed  his thanks along with his emotion, and for what he had intended to say  he substituted: \"No one ever called me John. I don't know the name. Call  me Jack.\"    \"Very well, Jack, and now let's see. You'll need some things from the  store. Can you come with me? It's not far.\"    \"Surely. And now what I need most is a razor to scrape the alkali and  stubble off my face.\"    The wide street, bordered by cottages peeping out of green and white  orchards, stretched in a straight line to the base of the ascent which  led up to the Pink Cliffs. A green square enclosed a gray church, a  school-house and public hall. Farther down the main thoroughfare were  several weather-boarded whitewashed stores. Two dusty men were riding  along, one on each side of the wildest, most vicious little horse Hare  had ever seen. It reared and bucked and kicked, trying to escape from  two lassoes. In front of the largest store were a number of mustangs all  standing free, with bridles thrown over their heads and trailing on the  ground. The loungers leaning against the"]]]
