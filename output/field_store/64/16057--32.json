Anderson                The Goblins' Christmas                        By            Elizabeth Anderson                  [Illustration]        Illustrated by Alexander Sharp                 Los Angeles       Segnogram Publishing Co.                1908          [Illustration]    Preface      Once upon a time I visited Fairy-land and spent a day in Goblin-town.  The people there are much like ourselves, only they are very, very small  and roguish. They play pranks on one another and have great fun. They  are good natured and jolly, and rarely get angry. But if one does get  angry, he quickly recovers his good nature and joins again in the sport.    If a Goblin should continue angry he would take on some visible form.  Perhaps he would become a toad or a squirrel, or some other little  animal, and would have to live here on the Earth-plane forevermore. But,  if he keeps good natured, he can come here and have his fun, and not be  seen by any one except a Seer, or very wise person.    The Goblins are gracious to the wise people now, but they were not  always so. A long, long time ago, on a Christmas-eve, the Fairy-folk  were having great sport. All the little people of the Unseen-world had  gathered together in the Earth-realm. There were Brownies, and Gnomes,  and Elves; even some little Cherubs had joined them. They were having a  wild dance and a gay time when who should appear but Kris Kringle! Now  the Fairies did not know that he was a Magician, or Seer, and so they  tried to make sport of him. But Kris by his wonderful magic, changed  them into the most beautiful toys. They became straight little  jumping-jacks, and dolls in bright dresses, and the dearest little  rabbit with white, soft fur. And somewhere in the bottom of the sleigh  one was turned into a cute little Teddy-bear. Then old Kris tucked all  these toys into his roomy sleigh, and shook the reins of his waiting  steed. \"Go on!\" he said, \"For I've many, many a chimney to reach  tonight.\"    Now this is the tale of \"The Goblins' Christmas\" that the moonbeams  told, as they heard it from the Fairy-Queen, who declares that every  word of it is perfectly true.

[Illustration]        [Illustration]        [Illustration]    The GOBLINS' CHRISTMAS          The big bright Moon hung high and round,          In a densely darkened sky;      The tall pines swayed, and mocked, and groaned;          The mountains grew so high      That the Man-in-the-Moon came out and said,          \"Ho! Spooks, for a merry dance.\"      The winds blow hard, the caverns roar,          While o'er the earth they prance.    [Illustration]        [Illustration]        A Witch and a Goblin led the sprites;          Out from the sky they sprung;      And down the milky way they slid,          And over a chasm swung.      The streams around ran witches' broth,          The fumes were strong and rank.      These Elfin creatures all were wroth,          While of the stuff they drank.    [Illustration]        [Illustration: Down the Milky way]        [Illustration: Sprite and Toadstool]        [Illustration]        [Illustration]        The cunning Moon looked on and laughed          With a shrill and sneering jibe;      Her soul grew fat to see them chaffed,          This mad and elfish tribe.      The big black caldron boiled so high          With food for these queer mites,      That it lit the world throughout the sky,          And down came all the Sprites.    [Illustration]        [Illustration: The big black caldron]        [Illustration]        [Illustration]        Their mad career upset a star,          As through the air they flew:      It cringed in fear, and shot afar,          And fell where no one knew.      Orion's sword was broke in bits,          Corona's crown was gone,      Capella seemed to lose her wits,          While all so longed for dawn.    [Illustration]        [Illustration]        Then from the night there came a sound          Of sleigh-bells ringing sweet;      Out of the chaos came a man--          Kris Kringle--for his Christmas treat.      \"Ho! Kris!\" they cried, \"We'll have some fun,          We'll bind the old man down,      We'll tie him up, and toss him o'er          Into our Goblin-town.\"    [Illustration]        [Illustration: As through the air they flew]        [Illustration]        They climbed the sleigh with shout and din,          To bind his hands and feet;      A hundred strong they clambered in          Our good old Kris to meet.      He sat quite still, with twinkling eyes,          Then seized his mystic wand,      He raised it up, and waved it round          Stilled was this chattering band.    [Illustration]        [Illustration: They climbed the sleigh]        [Illustration]        [Illustration]        Stiffly stark and still they stood,          Clad in elfish clothes;      Some were wax, and some were wood,          One had crushed his nose.      \"Playthings rare,\" he said and smiled,          \"For children rich and poor;      Some I'll leave the crippled child,          And some at the orphan's door.\"    [Illustration]        [Illustration]        He shook his reins, and called his steed          To bear him swiftly on.      Full well it knew its Master's need          To hurry e'er the dawn.      From house to house they scampered down,          Their sleigh-bells ringing clear,      Through chimneys in the sleepy town--          Good Kris and his reindeer.    [Illustration]        [Illustration: 'Playthings rare,' he said]        [Illustration]        [Illustration]        [Illustration: Fairy Queen]        [Illustration: Boy and Rabbit]        The windows rattled, the moonbeams tattled          A tale so strange and queer.      They told how at night, in dire affright          The Moon had hid in fear.        [Illustration]        That he'd called in sport his elfish court          Of spooks and witches gay,      Each Elfin child, by glee beguiled,          Brought scores of others, they say.        Then a man appeared, with flowing beard,          In a sled with a reindeer fleet;      They gathered about with din and shout,          To bind him hands and feet.        [Illustration: Witch with Broom]        Then the Moon laughed loud at the gathering crowd,          While he held his sides in mirth,      To see old Kris in a plight like this,          Toiling o'er the earth.        [Illustration: Elf and Spider]        [Illustration]        But alas for the Moon, he had laughed like a loon,          For Kris is a hero of old,      Yes, Kris is a seer; with his small reindeer,          He captured the Goblins bold.        And he changed them, they say in a wonderful way,          To toys, for his Christmas cheer.      The big dolls stare with a goblin air,          The small ones cringe with fear.        [Illustration]        While the moonbeams prattle, I hear a rattle          Of hoofs on the chimney side;      Then out on the snow I gaze below,          \"Hurrah! it's Kris Kringle,\" I cried.        Then, sly as a mouse, he entered the house,          And hung up his treasures so gay.      Then out with a dash, he sped like a flash,          Into the night, and away.

[Illustration: Cover]      _THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.          There were once three bears, who lived in a wood,      Their porridge was thick, and their chairs and beds good.      The biggest bear, Bruin, was surly and rough;      His wife, Mrs. Bruin, was called Mammy Muff.      Their son, Tiny-cub, was like Dame Goose's lad;      He was not very good, nor yet very bad.      Now Bruin, the biggest--the surly old bear--      Had a great granite bowl, and a cast-iron chair.      Mammy Muffs bowl and chair you would no doubt prefer--      They were both made of brick-bats, but both suited her.      Young Tiny-cub's bowl, chair, and bed were the best,--      This, big bears and baby bears freely confessed.      Mr. B----, with his wife and his son, went one day      To take a short stroll, and a visit to pay.      He left the door open, \"For,\" said he, \"no doubt      If our friend should call in, he will find us all out.\"      It was only two miles from dark Hazel-nut Wood,      In which the great house of the three Bruins stood,      That there lived a young miss, daring, funny, and fair,      And from having bright curls, she was called Goldenhair.      She had roamed through the wood to see what she could see,      And she saw going walking the Bruins all three.      Said she to herself, \"To rob bears is no sin;      The three bears have gone out, so I think I'll go in.\"      She entered their parlor, and she saw a great bowl,      And in it a spoon like a hair-cutter's pole.      \"That porridge,\" said she \"may stay long enough there,      It tastes like the food of the surly old bear,\"      She tried Mammy Muff's, and she said, \"Mrs. B----,      I think your taste and my taste will never agree.\"      Then she tried Tiny-Cub's bowl, and said, \"This is nice;      I will put in some salt, and of bread a thick slice.\"      The porridge she eat soon made her so great,      The chair that she sat on broke down with her weight;      The bottom fell out, and she cried in dismay,      \"This is Tiny-cub's chair, and oh, what will he say?      His papa is, I know, the most savage of bears,--      His mamma is a fury; but for her who cares?      I'm sure I do not; and then, as for her son,      That young bear, Tiny-cub--from him shall I run?      No, not I, indeed; but I will not sit here--      I shall next break the floor through--that's what I most fear;\"      So up-stairs she ran, and there three beds she found      She looked under each one, and she looked all around;      But no one she saw, so she got into bed--      It was surly old Bruin's, and well stuffed with lead.      Mammy Muffs next she tried; it was stuffed with round stones,      So she got into Tiny-cub's and rested her bones.      Goldenhair was asleep when the three bears came in.      Said Big Bruin, \"I'm hungry--to eat, let's begin--      WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE?\" he roared with such might;      His voice was like wind down the chimney at night.      \"WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE?\" growled out Mrs. B----;      Her voice was like cats fighting up in a tree.      \"WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE AND EATEN IT ALL?\"      Young Tiny-cub said, in a voice very small,      \"WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GREAT ARM CHAIR?\"      In voice like a thunder-storm, roared the big bear.      \"WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GOOD ARM CHAIR?\"      Growled out Mammy Muff, like a sow in despair.      \"WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?\"      Young Tiny-cub said, and so fierce was his frown,      That his mother with pride to his father said, \"There!      See our pet Tiny-cub can look just like a bear,\"      So roaring, and growling, and frowning, the bears,      One after the other, came running up-stairs.      \"WHO HAS BEEN UPON MY BED?\" old Bruin roared out,      In a voice just like rain down a large water-spout.      \"WHO HAS BEEN UPON MY BED?\" growled out Mammy Muff,      In a voice like her husband's, but not quite so rough.      \"WHO IS LYING ON MY BED?\" said young Tiny-Cub,      In a voice like hot water poured into a tub.      And Tiny-cub's breath was so hot as he spoke,      That Goldenhair dreamt of hot water, and woke.      She opened her eyes, and she saw the three bears,      And said, \"Let me go, please, I'll soon run down stairs.\"      But big Bruin was angry, and shouted out, \"No!      You had no right to come hither, and now you shan't go.      What we mean to do with you, ere long you shall find;      You can lie there and cry till I make up my mind.\"      To Mammy and Tiny then did big Bruin roar,      \"Go and block up the chimney and nail up the door;      This Goldenhair now has got into a scrape,      And if I can help it, she shall not escape.\"      But Goldenhair saw that a window was there,      (It was always kept open to let in fresh air),      So she jumped out of bed--to the window she ran,      Saying \"Three bears, good-bye! Catch me now if you can!\"      To the window the bears ran as fast as they could,      But Goldenhair flew like the wind through the wood.      She said the bears' breath had filled her with steam,      But when she grew older she said 'twas a dream,      And no doubt she was right to take such a view;      Still, some part of the story is certainly true,      For unto this day there is no one who dares,      To say that there never existed THREE BEARS.
