His early work, which was  done in the western United States and the Galápagos Islands, was followed  by many years of collecting in Mexico, Alaska, South America, and Africa.  He first visited British East Africa with Mr. Carl E. Akeley, next with  ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, and again with Mr. Paul J. Rainey. During  the Asiatic Zoölogical Expedition Mr. Heller devoted most of his time to  the gathering and preparation of small mammals. He joined our party late in  July in China.    Mrs. Andrews was the photographer of the Expedition. She had studied  photography as an amateur in Germany, France, and Italy, as well as in New  York, and had devoted especial attention to the taking of photographs in  natural colors. Such work requires infinite care and patience, but the  results are well worth the efforts expended.    Wu Hung-tao is a native of Foochow, China, and studied English at the  Anglo-Chinese College in that city. He lived for some time in Teng-yueh,  Yün-nan, in the employ of Mr. F.W. Carey, Commissioner of Customs, and not  only speaks mandarin Chinese but also several native dialects. He acted as  interpreter, head \"boy,\" and general field manager. My own work was devoted  mainly to the direction of the Expedition and the hunting of big game.    In order to reduce the heavy transportation charges we purchased only such  equipment in New York as could not be obtained in Shanghai or Hongkong.  Messrs. Shoverling, Daly & Gales furnished our guns, ammunition, tents, and  general camp equipment, and gave excellent satisfaction in attention to the  minor details which often assume alarming importance when an expedition is  in the field and defects cannot be remedied. All food and commissary  supplies were purchased in Hongkong (_see_ Chapter IX).           *       *       *       *       *    When the announcement of the Expedition was made by the American Museum of  Natural History it received wide publicity in America and other parts of  the world. Immediately we began to discover how many strange persons make  up the great cities of the United States, and we received letters and  telegrams from hundreds of people who wished to take part in the  Expedition. Men and boys were the principal applicants, but there was no  lack of women, many of whom came to the Museum for personal interviews.    Most of the letters were laughable in the extreme. One was from a butcher  who thought he might be of great assistance in preparing our specimens, or  defending us from savage natives; another young man offered himself to my  wife as a personal bodyguard; a third was sure his twenty years' experience  as a waiter would fit him for an important position on the Expedition, and  numerous women, young and old, wished to become \"companions\" for my wife in  those \"drear wastes.\"    Applicants continued to besiege us wherever we stopped on our way across  the continent and in San Francisco until we embarked on the afternoon of  March 28 on the S.S. _Tenyo Maru_ for Japan.    Our way across the Pacific was uneventful and as the great vessel drew in  toward the wharf in Yokohama she was boarded by the usual crowd of natives.  We were standing at the rail when three Japanese approached and, bowing in  unison, said, \"We are report for leading Japanese newspaper. We wish to  know all thing about Chinese animal.\" Evidently the speech had been  rehearsed, for with it their English ended abruptly, and the interview  proceeded rather lamely, on my part, in Japanese.    Japan was reveling in the cherry blossom season when we arrived and for a  person interested in color photography it was a veritable paradise. We  stayed three weeks and regretfully left for Peking by way of Korea. But  before we continue with the story of our further travels, we would like  briefly to review the political situation in China as a background for our  early work in the province of Fukien.          CHAPTER II      CHINA IN TURMOIL    During the time the Expedition was preparing to leave New York, China was  in turmoil. Yuan Shi-kai was president of the Republic, but the hope of his  heart was to be emperor of China. For twenty years he had plotted for the  throne; he had been emperor for one hundred miserable days; and now he was  watching, impotently, his dream-castles crumble beneath his feet. Yuan was  the strong man of his day, with more power, brains, and personality than  any Chinese since Li-Hung Chang. He always had been a factor in his  political world. His monarchial dream first took definite form as early as  1901 when he became viceroy of Chi-li, the province in which Peking is  situated.    It was then that he began to modernize and get control of the army which is  the great basis of political power in China. Properly speaking, there was  not, and is not now, a Chinese national army. It is rather a collection of  armies, each giving loyalty to a certain general, and he who secures the  support of the various commanders controls the destiny of China's four  hundred millions of people regardless of his official title.    Yuan was able to bind to himself the majority of the leading generals, and  in 1911, when the Manchu dynasty was overthrown, his plots and intrigues  began to bear fruit. By crafty juggling of the rebels and Manchus he  managed to get himself elected president of the new republic, although he  did not for a moment believe in the republican form of government. He was  always a monarchist at heart but was perfectly willing to declare himself  an ardent republican so long as such a declaration could be used as a  stepping stone to the throne which he kept ever as his ultimate goal.    As president he ruled with a high hand. In 1913 there was a rebellion in  protest against his official acts but he defeated the rebels, won over more  of the older generals, and solidified the army for his own interests,  making himself stronger than ever before.    At this time he might well have made a _coup d'état_ and proclaimed himself  emperor with hardly a shadow of resistance, but with the hereditary caution  of the Chinese he preferred to wait and plot and scheme. He wanted his  position to be even more secure and to have it appear that he reluctantly  accepted the throne as a patriotic duty at the insistent call of the  people.    Yuan's ways for producing the proper public sentiment were typically  Chinese but entirely effective, and he was making splendid progress, when  in May, 1915, Japan put a spoke in his wheel of fortune by taking advantage  of the European war and presenting the historical twenty-one demands, to  most of which China agreed.    This delayed his plans only temporarily, and Yuan's agents pushed the work  of making him emperor more actively than ever, with the result that the  throne was tendered to him by the \"unanimous vote of the people.\" To \"save  his face\" he declined at first but at the second offer he \"reluctantly\"  yielded and on December 12, 1915, became emperor of China.    But his triumph was short-lived, for eight days later tidings of unrest in  Yün-nan reached Peking. General Tsai-ao, a former military governor of the  province, appeared in Yün-nan Fu, the capital, and, on December 23, sent an  ultimatum to Yuan stating that he must repudiate the monarchy and execute  all those who had assisted him to gain the throne, otherwise Yün-nan would  secede; which it forthwith did on December 25.    Without doubt this rebellion was financed by the Japanese who had intimated  to Yuan that the change from a republican form of government would not meet  with their approval. The rebellion spread rapidly. On January 21, Kwei-chau  Province, which adjoins Yün-nan, seceded, and, on March 13, Kwang-si also  announced its independence.    About this time the Museum authorities were becoming somewhat doubtful as  to the advisability of proceeding with our Expedition. We had a long talk  with Dr. Wellington Koo, the Chinese Minister to the United States, at the  Biltmore Hotel in New York. Dr. Koo, while certain that the rebellion would  be short-lived, strongly advised us to postpone our expedition until  conditions became more settled. He offered to cable Peking for advice, but  we, knowing how unwelcome to the government of the harassed Yuan would be a  party of foreigners who wished to travel in the disturbed area, gratefully  declined and determined to proceed regardless of conditions. We hoped that  Yuan would be strong enough to crush this rebellion as he had that of 1913,  but day by day, as we anxiously watched the papers, there came reports of  other provinces dropping away from his standard.    On the _Tenyo Maru_ we met the Honorable Charles Denby, an ex-American  Consul-General at Shanghai and former adviser to Yuan Shi-kai when he was  viceroy of Chi-li. Mr. Denby was interested in obtaining a road concession  near Peking and was then on his way to see Yuan. His anxiety over the  political situation was not less than ours and together we often paced the  decks discussing what might happen; but every wireless report told of more  desertions to the ranks of the rebels.    It seemed to be the beginning of the end, for Yuan had lost his nerve. He  had decided to quit, and one hundred days after he became emperor elect he  issued a mandate canceling the monarchy and restoring the republic. But the  rebellious provinces were not satisfied and demanded that he get out  altogether.    About this time we reached Peking, literally blown in by a tremendous dust  storm which seemed an elemental manifestation of the human turmoil within  the grim old walls. Our cousin, Commander Thomas Hutchins, Naval Attaché of  the American Legation, was awaiting us on the platform, holding his hat  with one hand and wiping the dust from his eyes with the other.    The news we received from him was by no means comforting for in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12297"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#3)"],[1,"  always \"running and fighting.\" Lane had moved the family to Macon,  Georgia, and they lived on a place called \"Dunlap's Hill.\" That night  four preachers were preaching \"Fellow soldiers, the enemy is just here  to Bolden's Brook, sixteen miles away and you may be carried into  judgment; prepare to meet your God.\" While they were preaching, bombs  began to fly because Wheeler's Cavalry was only six miles away instead  of 16 miles; women screamed and children ran. Wheeler kept wagons ahead  of him so that when one was crippled the other would replace it. He says  he imagines he hears the voice of Sherman now, saying: \"Tell Wheeler to  go on to South Carolina; we will mow it down with grape shot and plow it  in with bombshell.\"    Emancipation came and with it great rejoicing. He recalls that  Republicans were called \"Radicals\" just after the close of the Civil  War.    Mr. Lane was able to save all of his meat, silver, and other valuables  during the war by having a cave dug in the hog pasture; the hogs  trampled over it daily.    \"Parson\" states that among the papers in his trunk he has a piece of  money called \"shin plasters\" which was used during the Civil War.    The slaves were not allowed to attend schools of any kind; and school  facilities immediately following Emancipation were very poor; when the  first teacher, Miss Smith, a Yankee, came to Sparta, Georgia and began  teaching Sunday School, all of the children were given testaments or  catechisms which their parents were afraid for them to keep lest their  masters whip them, but the teacher called on the parents and explained  to them that they were as free as their former masters.    \"Parson\" states that when he was born, his master named him \"Monk.\" His  grandfather, Willis Andrews, who was a free man of Pittsburg,  Pennsylvania, purchased the freedom of his wife Lizzie, but was never  able to purchase their four children; his father, also named Willis,  died a slave, was driven in an ox-cart to a hole that had been dug, put  in it and covered up; his mother nor children could stop work to attend  the funeral, but after the Emancipation, he and a brother returned,  found \"Uncle Bob\" who helped bury him and located his grave. Soon after  he had been given his freedom, \"Parson\" walked from Union Springs,  Alabama where his last master had taken him--back to Macon, Georgia, and  rejoined his mother, Rachel, his brothers, Samuel Augustus, San  Francisco, Simon Peter, Lewis, Carter, Powell Wendell and sisters,  Lizzie and Ann; they all dropped the name of their master, Lane, and  took the name of their grandfather, Andrews.    \"Parson\" possesses an almost uncanny memory and attributes it to his  inability to write things down and therefore being entirely dependent  upon his memory. He had passed 30 years of age and had two children who  could read and write before he could. His connection with Edward Waters  College has given him a decided advantage for education and there are  few things that he cannot discuss intelligently. He has come in contact  with thousands of students and all of the ministers connected with the  African Methodist Episcopal Church in the State of Florida and has  attended all of the State and General Conferences of this Church for the  past half century. He has lived to be 85 years of age and says he will  live until he is 106. This he will do because he claims: \"Your life is  in your hand\" and tells these narratives as proof:    \"In 1886 when the present Atlantic Coast Line Railroad was called the  S.F.W. and I was coming from Savannah to Florida, some tramps intent  upon robbery had removed spikes from the bridge and just as the alarm  was given and the train about to be thrown from the track, I raised the  window and jumped to safety. I then walked back two miles to report it.  More than 70 were killed who might have been saved had they jumped as I  did. As a result, the S.F. and W. gave me a free pass for life with  which I rode all over the United States and once into Canada.\" He  proudly displays this pass and states that he would like to travel over  the United States again but that the school keeps him too close.    \"I had been very sick but took no medicine; my wife went out to visit  Sister Nancy--shortly afterwards I heard what sounded like walking, and  in my imagination saw death entering, push the door open and draw back  to leap on me; I jumped through the window, my shirt hung, but I pulled  it out. Mr. Hodges, a Baptist preacher was hoeing in his garden next  door, looked at me and laughed. A woman yelled 'there goes Reverend  Andrews, and death is on him.' I said 'no he isn't on me but he's down  there.' Pretty soon news came that Reverend Hodges had dropped dead.  Death had come for someone and would not leave without them. I was weak  and he tried me first. Reverend Hodges wasn't looking, so he slipped up  on him.\"    \"Parson\" came to Umatilla, Florida, in 1882 from Georgia with a Mr.  Rogers brought him and six other men, their wives and children, to work  on the railroad; he was made the section \"boss\" which job he held until  a white man threatened to \"dock\" him because he was wearing a stiff  shirt and \"setting over a white man\" when he should have a shovel. This  was the opinion of a man in the vicinity, but another white friend,  named Javis warned him and advised him not to leave Umatilla, but  persuaded him to work for him cutting cord wood; although \"Parson\" had  never seen wood corded, he accepted the job and was soon given a pass to  Macon, Georgia, to get other men; he brought 13 men back and soon became  their \"boss\" and bought a house and decided to do a little hunting. When  he left this job he did some hotel work, cooked and served as train  porter. In 1892 he was ordained to preach and has preached and pastored  regularly from that time up to two years ago.    He is of medium size and build and partially bald-headed; what little  hair he has is very grey; he has keen eyes; his eyesight is very good;  he has never had to wear glasses. He is as supple as one half his age;  it is readily demonstrated as he runs, jumps and yells while attending  the games of his favorite pastimes, baseball and football. Wherever the  Edward Waters College football team goes, there \"Parson\" wants to go  also. Whenever the crowd at a game hears the scream \"Come on boys,\"  everyone knows it is \"Parson\" Andrews.    \"Parson\" has had two wives, both of whom are dead, and is the father of  eight children: Willis (deceased) Johnny, Sebron Reece of Martin,  Tennessee, Annie Lee, of Macon, Georgia, Hattie of Jacksonville, Ella  (deceased) Mary Lou Rivers of Macon, Georgia, and Augustus  somewhere-at-sea.    \"Parson\" does not believe in taking medicine, but makes a liniment with  which he rubs himself. He attributes his long life to his sense of  \"having quitting sense\" and not allowing death to catch him unawares. He  asserts that if he reaches the bedside of a kindred in time, he will  keep him from dying by telling him: \"Come on now, don't be crazy and  die.\"    He states that he enjoyed his slavery life and since that time life has  been very sweet. He knows and remembers most of the incidents connected  with members of the several Conferences of the African Methodist  Episcopal Church in Florida and can tell you in what minutes you may  find any of the important happenings of the past 30 or 40 years.

Austin lives near Greenwood, Jackson County, Florida, on a small farm  that he and his children operate. He says that he does not know his age,  does not remember ever having heard it. But he must be pretty old, he  says, \"'cause I was a right smart size when Mistuh Smith went off to  fight.\" He thinks he may be over a hundred--and he looks it--but he is  not sure.    Austin was born between Greene and Hancock Counties, on the Oconee  River, in Georgia. He uses the names of the counties interchangeably; he  cannot be definite as to just which one was his birthplace. \"The line  between 'em was right there by us,\" he says.    His father was Jack; for want of a surname of his own he took that of  his father and called himself Jack Smith. During a temporary shortage of  funds on his master's part, Jack and Bill's mother was sold to a planter  in the northern part of the state. It was not until long after his  emancipation that Bill ever saw either of them again.    Bill's father Jack was regarded as a fairly good carpenter, mason and  bricklayer; at times his master would let him do small jobs of repairing  of building for neighboring planters. These jobs sometimes netted him  hams, bits of cornmeal, cloth for dresses for his wife and children, and  other small gifts; these he either used for his small family or  bartered with the other slaves. Sometimes he sold them to the slaves for  money; cash was not altogether unknown among the slaves on the Smith  place.    Austin gives an interesting description of his master, Thomas Smith. He  says that \"sumptimes he was real rich and all of us had a good time. The  wuk wasn't hard then, cause if we had big crops he would borrow some  he'p from the other white folks. He used to give us meat every day, and  plenty of other things. One time he bought all of us shoes, and on  Sunday night would let us go to wherever the preacher was holdin'  meeting. He used to give my papa money sumptimes, too.    \"But they used to whisper that he would gamble a lot. We used to see a  whole lot of men come up to the house sumptimes"]]]
