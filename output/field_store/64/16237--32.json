There was an agricultural revolution from the two-field system in which  one field was fallow to the three-field system, in which there were  three large fields for the heavy and fertile land. Each field was  divided into long and narrow strips. Each strip represented a day's work  with the plough. One field had wheat, or perhaps rye, another had  barley, oats, beans, or peas, and the third was fallow. It had been  observed that legumes such as peas and beans restored the soil. These  were rotated yearly. There was a newly invented plough that was heavy  and made of wood and later had an attached iron blade. The plough had a  mould-board which caught the soil stirred by the plough blade and threw  it into a ridge alongside the furrow dug by the plough blade. This  plough was too heavy for two oxen and was pulled by a team of about  eight to ten oxen. Each ox was owned by a different man as was the  plough, because no one peasant could afford the complete set. Each  freeman was allotted certain strips in each field to bear crops. His  strips were far from each other, which insured some very fertile and  some only fair soil, and some land near his village dwelling and some  far away. These strips he cultivated, sowed with seed, and harvested for  himself and his family. After the harvest, they reverted to common  ownership for grazing by pigs, sheep, and geese. As soon as haymaking  was over, the meadows became common grazing land for horses, cows, and  oxen.  Not just any inhabitant, but usually only those who owned a piece  of land in the parish were entitled to graze their animals on the common  land, and each owner had this right of pasture for a definite number of  animals. The faster horse replaced the ox as the primary work  animal. Other farm implements were: coulters, which gave free passage to  the plough by cutting weeds and turf, picks, spades and shovels, reaping  hooks and scythes, and sledge hammers and anvils. Strips of land for  agriculture were added from waste land as the community grew. Waste  lands were moors bristling with brushwood, or gorse, heather and wanton  weeds, reed-coated marshes, quaking peat-bogs, or woods grown haphazard  on sand or rock. With iron axes, forests could be cleared to provide  more arable land.    Some villages had a smith, a wheelwright, and a cooper. There were  villages which had one or two market days in each week. Cattle,  sheep, pigs, poultry, calves, and hare were sold there. London was  a town on the Thames River under the protection of the Celtic  river god Lud: Lud's town. It's huts were probably built over the  water, as was Celtic custom. It was a port for foreign trade. Near  the town was Ludhill. Each Celtic tribe in England made its own  coinage. Silver and bronze were first used, and then gold. The  metal was put into a round form and then placed between two  engraved dies, which were hit.    Flint workers mined with deer antler picks and ox shoulder blade  shovels for flint to grind into axes, spearheads, and arrowheads.  Mine shafts were up to thirty feet deep and necessitated the use  of chalk lamps fueled by animal fat with wicks of moss. The flint  was hauled up in baskets.    Common men and women were now buried in tombs within memorial  burial mounds of earth with stone entrances and interior chambers.  A man's weapons and shield were buried with him and a woman's  spindle and weaving baton, and perhaps beads or pottery with her.  At times, mounds of earth would simply be covered over piles of  corpses and ashes in urns. In these mass graves, some corpses had  spear holes or sword cuts, indicating death by violence. The Druid  priests, the learned class of the Celts, taught the Celts to  believe in reincarnation of the soul after death of one body into  another body. They also threw prized possessions into lakes and  rivers as sacrifices to water gods. They placed images of gods and  goddesses in shrines, which were sometimes large enough to be  temples. They thought of their gods as supernatural magicians.    With the ability to grow food and the acquisition of land by  conquest by invading groups, the population grew. There were  different classes of men. The freemen were eorls [noble freemen]  or ceorls [ordinary free farmers]. Slaves were not free. Freemen  had long hair and beards. Slaves' hair was shorn from their heads  so that they were bald. Slaves were chained and often traded.  Prisoners taken in battle, especially native Britons taken by  invading groups, became slaves. A slave who was captured or  purchased was a \"theow\". An \"esne\" was a slave who worked for  hire. A \"weallas\" was a Welsh slave. Criminals became slaves of  the person wronged or of the king. Sometimes a father pressed by  need sold his children or his wife into bondage. Debtors, who  increased in number during famine, which occurred regularly,  became slaves by giving up the freeman's sword and spear, picking  up a slave's mattock [pick ax for the soils], and placing their  head within a lord's or lady's hands. They were called wite-  theows. The original meaning of the word lord was \"loaf-giver\".  Children with a slave parent were slaves. The slaves lived in huts  around the homes of big landholders, which were made of logs and  consisted on one large room or hall. An open hearth was in the  middle of the earthen floor of the hall, which was strewn with  rushes. There was a hole in the roof to let out the smoke. Here  the landholder and his men would eat meat, bread, salt, hot spiced  ale, and mead while listening to minstrels sing about the heroic  deeds of their ancestors. Richer men drank wine. There were  festivals which lasted several days, in which warriors feasted,  drank, gambled, boasted, and slept where they fell. Physical  strength and endurance in adversity were admired traits.    Slaves often were used as grain grinders, ploughmen, sowers,  haywards, woodwards, shepherds, goatherds, swineherds, oxherds,  cowherds, dairymaids, and barnmen. Slaves had no legal rights. A  lord could kill his slave at will. A wrong done to a slave was  regarded as done to his owner. If a person killed another man's  slave, he had to compensate him with the slave's purchase price.  The slave owner had to answer for the offenses of his slaves  against others, as for the mischief done by his cattle. Since a  slave had no property, he could not be fined for crimes, but was  whipped, mutilated, or killed.    During famine, acorns, beans, peas, and even bark were ground down  to supplement flour when grain stocks grew low. People scoured the  hedgerows for herbs, roots, nettles, and wild grasses, which were  usually left for the pigs. Sometimes people were driven to  infanticide or group suicide by jumping together off a cliff or  into the water.    Several large kingdoms came to replace the many small ones. The  people were worshipping pagan gods when St. Augustine came to  England in 596 A.D. to Christianize them. King AEthelbert of Kent  [much later a county] and his wife, who had been raised Christian  on the continent, met him when he arrived. The King gave him land  where there were ruins of an old city. Augustine used stones from  the ruins to build a church which was later called Canterbury. He  also built the first St. Paul's church in London. Aethelbert and  his men who fought with him and ate and lived in his household  [gesiths] became Christian. A succession of princesses went out  from Kent to marry other Saxon kings and convert them to  Christianity.    Augustine knew how to write, but King AEthelbert did not. The King  announced his laws at meetings of his people and his eorls would  decide the punishments. There was a fine of 120s. for disregarding  a command of the King. He and Augustine decided to write down some  of these laws, which now included the King's new law concerning  the church.    These laws concern personal injury, killing, theft, burglary,  marriage, adultery, and inheritance. The blood feud's private  revenge for killing had been replaced by payment of compensation  to the dead man's kindred. One paid a man's \"wergeld\" [worth] to  his kindred for causing his wrongful death. The wergeld [wer] of a  king was an unpayable amount of about 7000s., of an aetheling [a  king-worthy man of the extended royal family] was 1500s., of an  eorl, 300s., of a ceorl, 100s., of a laet [agricultural worker in  Kent, which class was between free and slave], 40-80s., and of a  slave nothing. At this time a shilling could buy a cow in Kent or  a sheep elsewhere. If a ceorl killed an eorl, he paid three times  as much as an eorl would have paid as murderer. The penalty for  slander was tearing out of the tongue. If an aetheling was guilty  of this offense, his tongue was worth five times that of a coerl,  so he had to pay proportionately more to ransom it. The crimes of  murder, treachery to one's own lord, arson, house breaking, and  open theft, were punishable by death and forfeiture of all  property.                                      - The Law -    \"THESE ARE THE DOOMS [DECREES] WHICH KING AETHELBERHT ESTABLISHED  IN THE DAYS OF AUGUSTINE     1. [Theft of] the property of God and of the church [shall be      compensated], twelve fold; a bishop's property, eleven fold; a      priest's property, nine fold; a deacon's property, six fold; a      cleric's property, three fold; church frith [breach of the peace      of the church; right of sanctuary and protection given to those      within its precincts], two fold [that of ordinary breach of the      public peace]; m....frith [breach of the peace of a meeting      place], two fold.     2.

If the King drink at any one's home, and any one there do any      lyswe [evil deed],"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13402"],[0,"The Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath (#3)"],[1,"source for nourishment, and if  through imperfect breathing the assimilation becomes imperfect, and  the lungs in turn become weakened, they are rendered still less able  to perform their work properly, and so in turn the body becomes  further weakened. Every particle of food and drink must be oxygenated  before it can yield us the proper nourishment, and before the waste  products of the system can be reduced to the proper condition to be  eliminated from the system. Lack of sufficient oxygen means Imperfect  nutrition, Imperfect elimination and imperfect health. Verily, \"breath  is life.\"    The combustion arising from the change in the waste products generates  heat and equalizes the temperature of the body. Good breathers are not  apt to \"take cold,\" and they generally have plenty of good warm blood  which enables them to resist the changes in the outer temperature.    In addition to the above-mentioned important processes the act of  breathing gives exercise to the internal organs and muscles, which  feature is generally overlooked by the Western writers on the subject,  but which the Yogis fully appreciate.    In imperfect or shallow breathing, only a portion of the lung cells  are brought into play, and a great portion of the lung capacity is  lost, the system suffering in proportion to the amount of  under-oxygenation. The lower animals, in their native state, breathe  naturally, and primitive man undoubtedly did the same. The abnormal  manner of living adopted by civilized man--the shadow that follows  upon civilization--has robbed us of our natural habit of breathing,  and the race has greatly suffered thereby. Man's only physical  salvation is to \"get back to Nature.\"          CHAPTER IV.      THE ESOTERIC THEORY OF BREATH.    The Science of Breath, like many other teachings, has its esoteric or  inner phase, as well as its exoteric or external. The physiological  phase may be termed the outer or exoteric side of the subject, and the  phase which we will now consider may be termed its esoteric or inner  side. Occultists, in all ages and lands, have always taught, usually  secretly to a few followers, that there was to be found in the air a  substance or principle from which all activity, vitality and life was  derived. They differed in their terms and names for this force, as  well as in the details of the theory, but the main principle is to be  found in all occult teachings and philosophies, and has for centuries  formed a portion of the teachings of the Oriental Yogis.    In order to avoid misconceptions arising from the various theories  regarding this great principle, which theories are usually attached to  some name given the principle, we, in this work, will speak of the  principle as \"Prana,\" this word being the Sanskrit term meaning  \"Absolute Energy.\" Many occult authorities teach that the principle  which the Hindus term \"Prana\" is the universal principle of energy or  force, and that all energy or force is derived from that principle,  or, rather, is a particular form of manifestation of that principle.  These theories do not concern us in the consideration of the subject  matter of this work, and we will therefore confine ourselves to an  understanding of prana as the principle of energy exhibited in all  living things, which distinguishes them from a lifeless thing. We may  consider it as the active principle of life--Vital Force, if you  please. It is found in all forms of life, from the amoeba to man--from  the most elementary form of plant life to the highest form of animal  life. Prana is all pervading. It is found in all things having life,  and as the occult philosophy teaches that life is in all things--in  every atom--the apparent lifelessness of some things being only a  lesser degree of manifestation, we may understand their teachings that  prana is everywhere, in everything. Prana must not be confounded with  the Ego--that bit of Divine Spirit in every soul, around which  clusters matter and energy. Prana is merely a form of energy used by  the Ego in its material manifestation. When the Ego leaves the body,  the prana, being no longer under its control, responds only to the  orders of the individual atoms, or groups of atoms, forming the body,  and as the body disintegrates and is resolved to its original  elements, each atom takes with it sufficient prana to enable it to  form new combinations, the unused prana returning to the great  universal storehouse from which it came. With the Ego in control,  cohesion exists and the atoms are held together by the Will of the  Ego.    Prana is the name by which we designate a universal principle, which  principle is the essence of all motion, force or energy, whether  manifested in gravitation, electricity, the revolution of the planets,  and all forms of life, from the highest to the lowest. It may be  called the soul of Force and Energy in all their forms, and that  principle which, operating in a certain way, causes that form of  activity which accompanies Life.    This great principle is in all forms of matter, and yet it is not  matter. It is in the air, but it is not the air nor one of its  chemical constituents. Animal and plant life breathe it in with the  air, and yet if the air contained it not they would die even though  they might be filled with air. It is taken up by the system along with  the oxygen, and yet is not the oxygen. The Hebrew writer of the book  of Genesis knew the difference between the atmospheric air and the  mysterious and potent principle contained within it. He speaks of  neshemet ruach chayim, which, translated, means \"the breath of the  spirit of life.\" In the Hebrew neshemet means the ordinary breath of  atmospheric air, and chayim means life or lives, while the word ruach  means the \"spirit of life,\" which occultists claim is the same  principle which we speak of as Prana.    Prana is in the atmospheric air, but it is also elsewhere, and it  penetrates where the air cannot reach. The oxygen in the air plays an  important part in sustaining animal life, and the carbon plays a  similar part with plant life, but Prana has its own distinct part to  play in the manifestation of life, aside from the physiological  functions.    We are constantly inhaling the air charged with prana, and are as  constantly extracting the latter from the air and appropriating it to  our uses. Prana is found in its freest state in the atmospheric air,  which when fresh is fairly charged with it, and we draw it to us more  easily from the air than from any other source. In ordinary breathing  we absorb and extract a normal supply of prana, but by controlled and  regulated breathing (generally known as Yogi breathing) we are enabled  to extract a greater supply, which is stored away in the brain and  nerve centers, to be used when necessary. We may store away prana,  just as the storage battery stores away electricity. The many powers  attributed to advanced occultists is due largely to their knowledge of  this fact and their intelligent use of this stored-up energy. The  Yogis know that by certain forms of breathing they establish certain  relations with the supply of prana and may draw on the same for what  they require. Not only do they strengthen all parts of their body in  this way, but the brain itself may receive increased energy from the  same source, and latent faculties be developed and psychic powers  attained. One who has mastered the science of storing away prana,  either consciously or unconsciously, often radiates vitality and  strength which is felt by those coming in contact with him, and such a  person may impart this strength to others, and give them increased  vitality and health. What is called \"magnetic healing\" is performed in  this way, although many practitioners are not aware of the source of  their power.    Western scientists have been dimly aware of this great principle with  which the air is charged, but finding that they could find no chemical  trace of it, or make it register an any of their instruments, they  have generally treated the Oriental theory with disdain. They could  not explain this principle, and so denied it. They seem, however, to  recognize that the air in certain places possesses a greater amount of  \"something\" and sick people are directed by their physicians to seek  such places in hopes of regaining, lost health.    The oxygen in the air is appropriated by the blood and is made use of  by the circulatory system. The prana in the air is appropriated by the  nervous system, and is used in its work. And as the oxygenated blood  is carried to all parts of the system, building up and replenishing,  so is the prana carried to all parts of the nervous system, adding  strength and vitality. If we think of prana as being the active  principle of what we call \"vitality,\" we will be able to form a much  clearer idea of what an important part it plays in our lives. Just as  is the oxygen in the blood used up by the wants of the system, so the  supply of prana taken up by the nervous system is exhausted by our  thinking, willing, acting, etc., and in consequence constant  replenishing is necessary. Every thought, every act, every effort of  the will, every motion of a muscle, uses up a certain amount of what  we call nerve force, which is really a form of prana. To move a muscle  the brain sends out an impulse over the nerves, and the muscle  contracts, and so much prana is expended. When it is remembered that  the greater portion of prana acquired by man comes to him from the air  inhaled, the importance of proper breathing is readily understood.          CHAPTER V.      THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.    It will be noticed that the Western scientific theories regarding the  breath confine themselves to the effects of the absorption of oxygen,  and its use through the circulatory system, while the Yogi theory also  takes into consideration the absorption of Prana, and its  manifestation"]]]
