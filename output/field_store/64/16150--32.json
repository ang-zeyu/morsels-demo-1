I gave her very  high wages, and she stayed till she had obtained several expensive  articles of dress, and then, _un beau matin_, she came to me full dressed,  and said, 'I must go.' 'When shall you return, Charlotte?' 'I expect you  will see no more of me.' And so we parted. Her sister was also living with  me, but her wardrobe was not yet completed, and she remained some weeks  longer till it was.\"    \"Such being the difficulties respecting domestic arrangements,\" adds our  author, \"it is obvious, that the ladies who are brought up amongst them  cannot have leisure for any developement of the mind: it is, in fact, out  of the question; and, remembering this, it is more surprising that some  among them should be very pleasing, than that none should be highly  instructed. But, whatever may be the talents of the persons who meet  together in society, the very shape, form, and arrangement of the meeting  is sufficient to paralyze conversation. The women invariably herd together  at one part of the room, and the men at the other; but, in justice to  Cincinnati, I must acknowledge that this arrangement is by no means  peculiar to that city, or to the western side of the Alleghanies.  Sometimes a small attempt at music produces a partial reunion; a few of  the most daring youths animated by the consciousness of curled hair and  smart waistcoats, approach the piano-forte, and begin to mutter a little  to the half-grown pretty things, who are comparing with one another 'how  many quarters' music they have had.' Where the mansion is of sufficient  dignity to have two drawing-rooms, the piano, the little ladies, and the  slender gentlemen are left to themselves; and on such occasions the sound  of laughter is often heard to issue from among them. But the fate of the  more dignified personages, who are left in the other room, is extremely  dismal. The gentlemen spit, talk of elections and the price of produce,  and spit again. The ladies look at each other's dresses till they know  every pin by heart; talk of Parson Somebody's last sermon on the day of  judgment, or Dr. T'otherbody's new pills for dyspepsia, till the 'tea' is  announced, when they all console themselves together for whatever they may  have suffered in keeping awake, by taking more tea, coffee, hot cake and  custard, hoe cake, johny cake, waffle cake, and dodger cake, pickled  peaches, and preserved cucumbers, ham, turkey, hung beef, apple sauce, and  pickled oysters, than ever were prepared in any other country of the known  world. After this massive meal is over, they return to the drawing-room,  and it always appeared to me that they remained together as long as they  could bear it, and then they rise _en masse_--cloak, bonnet, shawl, and  exit.\"    _Conversation of an American Woman._    \"'Well now, so you be from the old country? Ay--you'll see sights here I  guess.' 'I hope I shall see many.' 'That's a fact.--Why they do say,  that if a poor body contrives to be smart enough to scrape together a few  dollars, that your King George always comes down upon 'em, and takes it  all away. Don't he?' 'I do not remember hearing of such a transaction.' 'I  guess they be pretty close about it.' 'Your papers ben't like ourn, I  reckon? Now we says and prints just what we likes.' 'You spend a good deal  of time in reading the newspapers.' 'And I'd like you to tell me how we  can spend it better. How should freemen spend their time, but looking  after their government, and watching that them fellers as we gives offices  to, doos their duty, and gives themselves no airs?' 'But I sometimes think,  sir, that your fences might be in more thorough repair, and your roads in  better order, if less time was spent in politics.' 'The Lord! to see how  little you knows of a free country? Why, what's the smoothness of a road  put against the freedom of a free-born American? And what does a broken  zig-zag signify, comparable to knowing that the men what we have been  pleased to send up to Congress, speaks handsome and straight, as we  chooses they should?' 'It is from a sense of duty, then, that you all go  to the liquor store to read the papers?' 'To be sure it is, and he'd be no  true-born American as didn't. I don't say that the father of a family  should always be after liquor, but I do say that I'd rather have my son  drunk three times in a week, than not to look after the affairs of his  country,'\"    _Hogs_.    \"Immense droves of hogs were continually arriving from the country by the  road that led to most of our favourite walks; they were often fed and  lodged in the prettiest valleys, and worse still, were slaughtered beside  the prettiest streams. Another evil threatened us from the same quarter,  that was yet heavier. Our cottage had an ample piazza, (a luxury almost  universal in the country houses of America,) which, shaded by a group of  acacias, made a delightful sitting-room; from this favourite spot we one  day perceived symptoms of building in a field close to it; with much  anxiety we hastened to the spot, and asked what building was to be erected  there. ''Tis to be a slaughter-house for hogs,' was the dreadful reply.  As there were several gentlemen's houses in the neighbourhood, I asked if  such an erection might not be indicted as a nuisance. 'A what?' 'A  nuisance,' I repeated, and explained what I meant. 'No, no,' was the reply,  'that may do very well for your tyrannical country, where a rich man's  nose is more thought of than a poor man's mouth; but hogs be profitable  produce here, and we be too free for such a law as that, I guess.'\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE BELL ROCK LIGHT HOUSE.    On the 9th ult., about 10 P.M., a large herring-gull struck one of the  south-eastern mullions of the Bell Rock Light House with such force, that  two of the polished plates of glass, measuring about two feet square, and  a quarter of an inch in thickness, were shivered to pieces and scattered  over the floor in a thousand atoms, to the great alarm of the keeper on  watch, and the other two inmates of the house, who rushed instantly to the  light room. It fortunately happened, that although one of the red-shaded  sides of the reflector-frame was passing in its revolution at the moment,  the pieces of broken glass were so minute, that no injury was done to the  red glass. The gull was found to measure five feet between the tips of the  wings. In his gullet was found a large herring, and in its throat a piece  of plate-glass, of about one inch in length.--(From No. I. of the  _Nautical Magazine_, a work of clever execution, great promise, and  extraordinary cheapness.)           *       *       *       *       *      NO CHALK.    It appears that the bill for the abolition of imprisonment for debt in  America \"works well,\" as applied to New York; and the system is  consequently to be put in general force all over the Union--a fact, which,  as a poet like Mr. Watts would say, adds another leaf to America's laurel.  But the paper which announced this gratifying intelligence, relates in a  paragraph nearly subjoined to it, a circumstance in natural history that  seems to have some connexion with the affairs between debtor and creditor  in the United States. It informs us, that up to the present period of  scientific investigation, \"_no chalk_ has been discovered in North  America.\" Now this is really a valuable bit of discovery; and we heartily  wish that the Geological Society, instead of wasting their resources on  anniversary-dinners, as they have lately been doing, would at once set  about establishing the proof of a similar absence of that article in this  country. Surely, our brethren on the other side of the Atlantic, will not  fail to take the hint which nature herself has so benificently thrown out  to them; and instead of abolishing the power of getting into prison, put  an end at once to the power of getting into debt. The scarcity of chalk  ought certainly to be numbered among the natural blessings of America. Had  the soil on that side of the ocean been as chalky as this, America might  have been visited by a comet, like Pitt, with a golden train of eight  hundred millions.--_Monthly Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *        THE NATURALIST.      ANGLING.    (_From the Angler's Museum, quoted in the Magazine of Natural History_.)    Every one who is acquainted with the habits of fish is sensible of the  extreme acuteness of their vision, and well knows how easily they are  scared by shadows in motion, or even at rest, projected from the bank; and  often has the angler to regret the suspension of a successful fly-fishing  by the accidental passage of a person along the opposite bank of the  stream: yet, by noting the apparently trivial habits of one of nature's  anglers, not only is our difficulty obviated, but our success insured. The  heron, guided by a wonderful instinct, preys chiefly in the absence of the  sun; fishing in the dusk of the morning and evening, on cloudy days and  moonlight nights. But should the river become flooded to discoloration,  then does the \"long-necked felon\" fish indiscriminately in sun and shade;  and in a recorded instance of his fishing on a bright day, it is related  of him, that, like a skilful angler, he occupied the shore opposite the  sun.           *       *       *       *       *      SKILFUL ANATOMISTS.    (_For the Mirror_.)    It may not be generally known that the tadpole acts the same part with  fish that ants do with birds; and that through the agency of this little  reptile, perfect skeletons, even of the smallest fishes may be obtained.  To produce this, it is but necessary to suspend the fish by threads  attached to the head and tail in an horizontal position, in a jar of water,  such as is found in a pond, and change it often, till the tadpoles have  finished their work. Two or three tadpoles will perfectly dissect a fish  in twenty-four hours.    H.S.S.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11743"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 19, No. 548, May (#3)"],[1,"such a proportion of pounded  glass was added as, without causing the ware to soften so as to  lose its form, would give it when exposed to a full red heat a  semi-transparency resembling that of the fine porcelain of China. The  Chelsea ware, besides bearing a very imperfect similarity in body to  the Chinese, admitted only of a very fusible lead glaze; and in the  taste of its patterns, and in the style of their execution, stood  as low perhaps as any on the list. The china works at Derby come, I  believe, the next in date; then those of Worcester, established in  1751: and the most modern are those of Coalport, in Shropshire; of the  neighbourhood of Newcastle, in Staffordshire, and in other parts of  that county.    The porcelain clay used at present in all the English works is  obtained in Cornwall, by pounding and washing over the gray  disintegrated granite which occurs in several parts of that county: by  this means the quartz and mica are got rid of, and the clay resulting  from the decomposition of the felspar is procured in the form of a  white, somewhat gritty powder. This clay is not fusible by the highest  heat of our furnaces, though the felspar, from the decomposition of  which it is derived, forms a spongy milk-white glass, or enamel, at  a low white heat. But felspar, when decomposed by the percolation of  water, while it forms a constituent of granite, loses the potash,  which is one of its ingredients to the amount of about 15 per cent,  and with it the fusibility that this latter substance imparts.    The siliceous ingredient is calcined flint; and in some of the  porcelain works, (particularly, I believe, those at Worcester,) the  soapstone from the Lizard-point, in Cornwall, is employed. These are  all the avowed materials; but there is little doubt that the alkalies,  or alkaline earths, either pure or in combination, are also used,  in order to dispose the other ingredients to assume that state of  semi-fusion characteristic of porcelain.    (The principal processes are) the grinding and due mixture of the  ingredients, in order to obtain a mass sufficiently plastic; the  forming this mass on the wheel; the subsequent drying of the ware;  the first firing, by which it is brought to the state of biscuit; the  application of the firmer colours occasionally on the surface of the  biscuit; the dipping the biscuit in the glaze; the second firing, by  which the glaze is vitrified; the pencilling in of the more tender  colours on the surface of the glaze; and the third and last firing  that is given to the porcelain.    It is not for me to determine which of our English porcelains is  the best; probably, indeed, one will be found superior in hardness,  another in whiteness, a third in the thinness and evenness of the  glaze, a fourth in the form of the articles, a fifth in the design,  and a sixth in the colours. In hardness and in fusibility, they are  probably all inferior to the Dresden and to the Sevres porcelain; for  pieces in biscuit and in white glaze, from both these manufactories,  are imported in considerable quantities, in order to be painted and  finished here. But it is equally certain, that the last ten years  have seen the commencement, and, in part, the completion, of such  improvements in this fabric, as will probably place the English  porcelains on an equality with the best of the continental European  ones.    Advantage has recently been taken of the semi-transparency of  porcelain biscuit to form it into plates, and to delineate upon it  some very beautiful copies of landscapes and other drawings, by so  adapting the various thicknesses of the plate as to produce, when held  between the eye and the light, the effects of light and shadow in  common drawings. The invention originated in the ingenuity of our  French neighbours.           *       *       *       *       *      NOTES OF A READER      IMPROVEMENT OF LANCASHIRE.      The west of England has considerably the advantage over the eastern  side of the island. One way or another nature did much more for it. It  is true, that the eastern side was civilized much earlier; yet human  ingenuity and industry have of late years been much more successfully  employed in turning the gifts of nature to the best possible account.  Ireland and America are customers, for whom, though they were long in  coming, it was worth while to wait. After all, Lancashire is the most  remarkable and characteristic feature in the comparison. From being  among the most backward parts of England, this county has _worked_ its  way into the front rank. The contrast between its condition up to the  middle of the last century, and the astonishing spectacle which it  exhibits at present, belongs to the transformation which a hundred  years create in a newly settled country like America, far more than to  the gradual improvements and changes of an old English county.    It would be curious to analyze the concurrent causes, and marshal  the successive steps, by which Lancashire has advanced;--not only  succeeding in appropriating to itself a leading interest in the  creative inventions of Watt and Arkwright, but connecting its name  in honourable alliance with literature and science. The very  circumstances from which a contrary presumption would originally have  been drawn, have (singularly enough) principally contributed to its  extraordinary progress. Lancashire owes the canals, by which the  commercial thoroughfare of that end of England has been turned from  the Humber to the Mersey, to the enterprise of a _Peer_. It owes the  docks, which have about them almost a Roman presentiment of future  greatness, to the spirit of a _Corporation_. It owes the taste and  accomplishments, by which the character of its wealth has been raised  above the drudgery and fanaticism of money-getting, almost entirely to  the zeal of a few _Dissenters_. The name of Governor Clinton is not so  pre-eminently united with the canal policy of America, as is the name  of the Duke of Bridgewater with the canals of England. He staked his  last shilling on the chance of thus cutting out an inland north-west  passage to the Atlantic. The corporation of Liverpool, by an  enlightened application of their vast resources, have accelerated,  consolidated, and secured the realization, of every expectation and  contingency which fortune threw in their way. They have hastened,  not to say, anticipated, events. There can be as little doubt of the  effect which the light radiating from the assemblage of Priestley,  Wakefield, Aikin, &c. at Warrington; from the presence of Percival,  Henry, Ferriar, and Dalton, at Manchester; and from that of Roscoe  and Currie at Liverpool, spread over their circle. The literary  attainments and cultivation of the manufacturers and merchants of  Lancashire, as a body, seem otherwise likely long to have lagged  behind their general powers of understanding, and their real station  in society.--_Edinburgh Review_.           *       *       *       *       *      ENNUI OF FASHION.      It must be owned that five years form an awful lapse in human life:--a  lapse whose hours and minutes leave no where a trace more sharp and  injurious than on the minds and countenances of individuals involved  in the buzzing, stinging gnatswarms of fashionable life. Elsewhere,  existence marches with a more dignified step, and the scenes pictured  among the records of our memory assume a grander aspect; they lie in  masses,--their shadows are broader,--their lights more brilliantly  thrown out. But reminiscences of a life of ton are as vexatious as  they are frivolous. The season of 1829 differs from that of 1830,  only inasmuch as its quadrilles are varied with galoppes as well  as waltzes, and danced at Lady A.'s and Lady B.'s,--instead of the  Duchess of D.'s, and Countess E.'s. The Duchess is dead,--the Countess  ruined;--but no matter!--there are still plenty of balls to be had.  \"Another and another still succeeds!\" Since young ladies _will_ grow  up to be presented, lady-mothers and aunts _must_ continue to project  breakfasts, water parties, and galas, whereby to throw them in the way  of flirtation, courtship, and marriage. Mischief, in her most smiling  mask, sits like the beautiful witch in Thalaba at an everlasting  spinning-wheel, weaving a mingled yarn of sin and sorrow for the  daughters of Fashion. Although the cauldron of Hecate and her  priestesses has vanished from the heath at Forres, it bubbles in  nightly incantations among the elm-trees of Grosvenor Square; and  Hopper and Hellway, Puckle and Straddling, now croak forth their  chorus of rejoicing where golden lamps swing blazing over the ecarte  tables, and the soft strains of the Mazurka enervate the atmosphere of  the gorgeous temples of May Fair. Never yet was there a woman _really_  improved in attraction by mingling with the motley throng of the _beau  monde_. She may learn to dress better, to step more gracefully; her  head may assume a more elegant turn, her conversation become more  polished, her air more distinguished;--but in point of _attraction_  she acquires nothing. Her simplicity of mind departs;--her generous,  confiding impulses of character are lost;--she is no longer inclined  to interpret favourably of men and things,--she listens without  believing,--sees without admiring; has suffered persecution without  learning mercy;--and been taught to mistrust the candour of others  by the forfeiture of her own. The freshness of her disposition  has vanished with the freshness of her complexion; hard lines are  perceptible in her very soul, and crowsfeet contract her very fancy.  No longer pure and fair as the statue of alabaster, her beauty, like  that of some painted waxen effigy, is tawdry and meretricious. It is  not alone the rouge upon the cheek and the false tresses adorning  the forehead, which repel the ardour of admiration; it is the  artificiality of mind with which such"]]]
