It is sufficient that the chance was not  lost, for in the eastern ambulatory of the cathedral church at  Chichester is to be seen, as a result, one of the most truly beautiful  examples of mediaeval design that English architecture now possesses.    [Illustration: THE CLERESTORY PASSAGE, NAVE, SOUTH SIDE. _From a  photograph by Mr. F. Bond_.]    In the nave some parts of the old limestone walls had been injured by  the fall of the roofs; they were also seriously damaged by the beams  that had been laid upon them, for these, after their fall, would  continue to burn as they rested against those portions of walling  which remained standing. It was no doubt by some such cause as this  that the early clerestory was disfigured and partly destroyed. In  either case, the old clerestory arcade of the twelfth century no  longer remained as it was before; and though there were already stone  vaults to the aisles of the nave before the fire occurred, yet they  also disappeared and made way for newer ones. The outer roof over the  triforium evidently shared the fate of the other coverings; and the  arched abutment in the triforium, which acted as a support to this  roof and the walling below the clerestory, now disappeared. It may be  that this arching was not completely destroyed by the fire alone; no  doubt some that remained was intentionally removed to prepare the way  for the new work.    The same bishop who had witnessed the completion of the earlier  operations began with much enterprise to see about the reconstruction,  but not the restoration, of what had been destroyed. Some portions  were repaired, others rebuilt; but the greater part of the work now  undertaken involved an entire change in the character of some of the  principal features of the earlier scheme. In fact, this incident in  the history of our subject gave \"occasion to one of the most curious  and interesting examples of the methods employed by the mediaeval  architects in the repairs of their buildings.\" [2]      [2] Willis, \"Chichester Cathedral,\" p. 6.    Having decided that they would, if possible, avoid all future risk of  a similar catastrophe, a system of vaulting was adopted as the best  solution of the problem,--this involved necessarily a remodelling of  the interior; and so, neglecting the Isle of Wight limestone and the  Sussex sandstone, which at first had been the material used for the  walling, the masons were directed to use stone of finer texture and  smaller grain. It has been thought by some that this material was  brought from Caen in Normandy. The same stone was used to re-face  parts of the nave piers. And in addition Purbeck marble was selected  instead of that which was to be found in Sussex.    It is interesting to remember that the new choir of Canterbury had  only been finished about three years before the fire occurred at  Chichester. This work had been begun by William of Sens and finished  by William the Englishman; and though it was so large an undertaking,  it appears to have been commenced and completed between the years 1174  and 1184. This would very naturally exert some influence upon the  building projects of a neighbouring see. Whether any of the actual  craftsmen from Canterbury worked again at Chichester or not we cannot  tell, but it is evident that the Kentish experience was of great help  to Sussex in the new venture. When it had been decided how they should  operate, it was natural that the covering of the building must be the  first provision. This involved the repair of the shattered clerestory,  and then they were free to proceed in other directions. Further than  this we have no means of learning what method was followed in carrying  on the new work; but it continued, so that in about twelve years the  building was dedicated again.    There is nothing now to indicate that the provision of a vault had  been intended by the original builders of these walls. This deficiency  was met by the insertion of vaulting shafts and the addition of  external buttressing; for as the pressure of the flat wooden roof was  exerted for the most part vertically upon its supports, that of the  vault would be a strong lateral thrust as well as vertical pressure,  and these were to be provided for. We shall see presently that all the  real beauties of this most interesting work were the outcome both of  the needs of practical structure and the requirements of ritual and a  ceremonial expression of the liturgy.    [Illustration: HISTORICAL SECTION FROM WILLIS'S ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY.  Original Elevation. Present Elevation. Two Bays of Retro-choir. (Scale  29'2 feet to 1 in.)]    [Illustration: THE CLERESTORY, NORTH SIDE OF NAVE. _From a photograph  by Mr. Francis Bond_. ]    It is not possible for us to discover exactly when the several parts  of the work undertaken after the fire of 1186-1187 were begun, nor  when they were finished. Of dates we have little knowledge, except  that of the dedication in 1199, the fall of two towers in 1210, and  the various indications of architectural activity at certain periods  given by the several dates mentioned in connection with donations,  bequests, and royal sanctions in the episcopal statutes and other  documents. These nearly all show that the time of greatest activity  was after 1186 and before 1250. If such a feat as has been mentioned  was performed at Canterbury between 1174 and 1184, was it not possible  also at Chichester? Then it becomes necessary to assume that the  structural alterations were continuing during the whole of the period  suggested; and this was so. Enough work had been done by 1199 to allow  of another dedication of the building. Seffrid II. had been bishop  from 1180-1204, and the register of Bishop William Rede, written one  hundred and sixty years later, explicitly states that Seffrid  \"re-edified the Church of Chichester.\" This is a comprehensive  statement, but it might easily include at least the greater part of  the vaulting with some form of external roof. Such a change as this  involved the alteration of the nave and aisle piers, so that the  slight vaulting shafts of finer stone might be inserted in the older  masonry. The lower part of each of the piers of the nave arcade on the  side towards the centre of the church was re-faced with the same  material, and smaller shafts of Purbeck marble were introduced upon  the piers, replacing probably the heavy ones of an earlier date. These  shafts formed the support to a more delicate moulded member, which was  now substituted for the original and very simple outer order of the  original arch. A string-course of Purbeck marble was inserted as a  line of separation between the nave arcade and the triforium, and also  between the triforium and clerestory. The triforium itself remained as  it had been before 1186; but the clerestory was dressed again, so that  it obtained quite a new character. It was re-faced with the  fine-grained stone, and the slight shafts which supported the  clerestory arcades were provided with Purbeck capitals and bases. This  arcading itself was also changed from its earlier type. The central  arch was still made round in form, but those on either side of it were  each pointed, and all were more finely moulded than before. Above this  point rises the new stone vault, which is carried upon a framework of  strong transverse and diagonal ribs. Between these the shell, or  filling, which formed the surface of the vault, is of chalk, roughly  cut and irregularly laid; above this was placed a thick coat of  concrete.    Some flying-buttresses were built now in order to meet the thrust  exerted by the new arched vault of the nave. These were constructed in  two series, one being concealed under the sloping roof over the  triforium and acting in place of the earlier round-arched abutment.  Its supports were provided at the points where the transverse and  diagonal arches of the nave vault began to spring away from the  vertical plane of the walls. The other series was the immediate  counter-poise to any direct thrust exerted by the arching of the vault  against the upper section of the same walls. There was, in fact, a  large buttress added to support these nave walls at that point from  which each set of vault-carrying ribs began to rise. This buttress,  though apparently sub-divided, was one thing, but of composite  structure. It was pierced first by the aisle, next by the triforium,  and then again above the roof of the triforium. It will be seen that  most of these alterations were the direct result of the introduction  of a stone vault. But the almost entire renewal of the eastern part  of the cathedral was made possible by the destruction and total  removal of the apsidal terminations of the earlier work. It has been  suggested that the fire may have so badly damaged this portion as to  allow no alternative but rebuilding. What may have been the actual  cause of its removal it is impossible for us now to know; but the  substitute is quite a perfect piece of work of its kind. This  ambulatory, or presbytery, as it is commonly misnamed, was nearly all  newly built from the foundations during the first half of the  thirteenth century. The continuation of the arcade, the triforium, the  clerestory, and the vault, the vaulting of the aisles and the chapels  forming their terminations eastwards,--all this, with the new arch at  the entrance to the earlier lady-chapel, was work of the same date.    [Illustration: PIER-CAPITALS IN THE RETRO-CHOIR. _From a photograph by  S.B. Bolas & Co_.]    Some new buttressing had been added to the south-west tower when the  upper part of the tower itself was rebuilt; but the larger works were  the addition of a vaulted sacristy in the corner between the west side  of the south end of the transept and the nave. On the opposite side of  the same part of the transept a square-ended chapel with a vestry  attached was added in place"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13334"],[0,"The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce — Volume 2: In the Midst of Life: Tales of (#3)"],[1," apart one pace. These movements  left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the  same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge. The end  upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a fourth.  This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was  now held by that of the sergeant. At a signal from the former the latter  would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down  between two ties. The arrangement commended itself to his judgment as  simple and effective. His face had not been covered nor his eyes  bandaged. He looked a moment at his \"unsteadfast footing,\" then let his  gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his  feet. A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his eyes  followed it down the current. How slowly it appeared to move! What a  sluggish stream!    He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and  children. The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding  mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the  soldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him. And now he became  conscious of a new disturbance. Striking through the thought of his dear  ones was a sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp,  distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith's hammer  upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality. He wondered what it  was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by--it seemed both. Its  recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell. He  awaited each stroke with impatience and--he knew not why--apprehension.  The intervals of silence grew progressively longer; the delays became  maddening. With their greater infrequency the sounds increased in  strength and sharpness. They hurt his ear like the thrust of a knife; he  feared he would shriek. What he heard was the ticking of his watch.    He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. \"If I could free  my hands,\" he thought, \"I might throw off the noose and spring into the  stream. By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming vigorously,  reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home. My home, thank God,  is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones are still beyond  the invader's farthest advance.\"    As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were flashed  into the doomed man's brain rather than evolved from it the captain  nodded to the sergeant. The sergeant stepped aside.    II    Peyton Farquhar was a well-to-do planter, of an old and highly respected  Alabama family. Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a  politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently  devoted to the Southern cause. Circumstances of an imperious nature,  which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from taking  service with the gallant army that had fought the disastrous campaigns  ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the inglorious  restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the larger life of  the soldier, the opportunity for distinction. That opportunity, he felt,  would come, as it comes to all in war time. Meanwhile he did what he  could. No service was too humble for him to perform in aid of the South,  no adventure too perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the  character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier, and who in good  faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of  the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war.    One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench  near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the  gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to  serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her  husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from  the front.    \"The Yanks are repairing the railroads,\" said the man, \"and are getting  ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put  it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has  issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian  caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels or trains  will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.\"    \"How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?\" Farquhar asked.    \"About thirty miles.\"    \"Is there no force on this side the creek?\"    \"Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single  sentinel at this end of the bridge.\"    \"Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the  picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,\" said Farquhar,  smiling, \"what could he accomplish?\"    The soldier reflected. \"I was there a month ago,\" he replied. \"I  observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of  driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now  dry and would burn like tow.\"    The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked  her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An hour later,  after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the  direction from which he had come. He was a Federal scout.    III    As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost  consciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was  awakened--ages later, it seemed to him--by the pain of a sharp pressure  upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen, poignant  agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fibre of  his body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash along well-defined  lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid  periodicity. They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to  an intolerable temperature. As to his head, he was conscious of nothing  but a feeling of fulness--of congestion. These sensations were  unaccompanied by thought. The intellectual part of his nature was  already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment. He  was conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he  was now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung  through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all  at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with  the noise of a loud plash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all  was cold and dark. The power of thought was restored; he knew that the  rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream. There was no  additional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already  suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die of hanging at  the bottom of a river!--the idea seemed to him ludicrous. He opened his  eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how  distant, how inaccessible! He was still sinking, for the light became  fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer. Then it began to grow  and brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface--knew it  with reluctance, for he was now very comfortable. \"To be hanged and  drowned,\" he thought, \"that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot.  No; I will not be shot; that is not fair.\"    He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist  apprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the struggle  his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without  interest in the outcome. What splendid effort!--what magnificent, what  superhuman strength! Ah, that was a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell  away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each  side in the growing light. He watched them with a new interest as first  one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it  away and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a  water-snake. \"Put it back, put it back!\" He thought he shouted these  words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by  the direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck ached horribly;  his brain was on fire; his heart, which had been fluttering faintly,  gave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth. His whole  body was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish! But his  disobedient hands gave no heed to the command. They beat the water  vigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface. He  felt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest  expanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs  engulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a  shriek!    He was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were, indeed,  preternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful disturbance of  his organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record  of things never before perceived. He felt the ripples upon his face and  heard their separate sounds as they struck. He looked at the forest on  the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves and the  veining of each leaf--saw the very insects upon them: the locusts, the  brilliant-bodied flies, the gray spiders stretching their webs from twig  to twig. He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a  million blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that danced above the  eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon-flies' wings, the  strokes of the water-spiders' legs, like oars which had lifted their  boat--all these made audible music. A fish slid along beneath his eyes  and he heard the rush of its body parting the water.    He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the  visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point,  and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers "]]]
