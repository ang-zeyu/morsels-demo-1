The houses  and public places were being decorated with branches and flowers.  No  guard was set; no work was done.  Conran sent into the town a number of  his men, some openly, as if to take part in the festivities, others  hidden at the bottom of the cars which conveyed into Marseilles the  branches and foliage from the outskirts.  He himself went and lay in  ambush in a neighboring glen, with seven thousand men, they say, but the  number is probably exaggerated, and waited for his emissaries to open the  gates to him during the night.  But once more a woman, a near relation of  the Gallic chieftain, was the guardian angel of the Greeks, and revealed  the plot to a young man of Marseilles, with whom she was in love.  The  gates were immediately shut, and so many Segobrigians as happened to be  in the town were massacred.  Then, when night came on, the inhabitants,  armed, went forth to surprise Conran in the ambush where he was awaiting  the moment to surprise them.  And there he fell with all his men.    Delivered as they were from this danger, the Massilians nevertheless  remained in a difficult and disquieting situation.  The peoplets around,  in coalition against them, attacked them often, and threatened them  incessantly.  But whilst they were struggling against these  embarrassments, a grand disaster, happening in the very same spot whence  they had emigrated half a century before, was procuring them a great  accession of strength and the surest means of defence.  In the year 542  B.C., Phocea succumbed beneath the efforts of Cyrus, King of Persia, and  her inhabitants, leaving to the conqueror empty streets and deserted  houses, took to their ships in a body, to transfer their homes elsewhere.  A portion of this floating population made straight for Marseilles;  others stopped at Corsica, in the harbor of Alalia, another Phocean  colony.  But at the end of five years they too, tired of piratical life  and of the incessant wars they had to sustain against the Carthaginians,  quitted Corsica, and went to rejoin their compatriots in Gaul.    Thenceforward Marseilles found herself in a position to face her enemies.  She extended her walls all round the bay, and her enterprises far away.  She founded on the southern coast of Gaul and on the eastern coast of  Spain, permanent settlements, which are to this day towns: eastward of  the Rhone, Hercules' harbor, Moncecus (Monaco), Niccea (Nice), Antipolis  (Antibes); westward, Heraclea Cacabaria (Saint-Gilles), Agaththae  (Agdevall), Emporia; (Ampurias in Catalonia), &c., &c.  In valley of the  Rhone, several towns of the Gauls, Cabellio were (Cavaili like on), Greek  Avenio (Avignon), Arelate (Arles), for instance, colonies, so great there  was the number of travellers or established merchants who spoke Greek.  With this commercial activity Marseilles united intellectual and  scientific activity; her grammarians were among the first to revise and  annotate the poems of Homer; and bold travellers from Marseilles,  Euthymenes and Pytheas by name, cruised, one along the western coast of  Africa beyond the Straits of Gibraltar, and the other the southern and  western coasts of Europe, from the mouth of the Tanais (Don), in the  Black Sea, to the latitudes and perhaps into the interior of the Baltic.  They lived, both of them, in the second half of the fourth century  B.C.,  and they wrote each a Periplus, or tales of their travels, which have  unfortunately been almost entirely lost.    But whatever may have been her intelligence and activity, a single town  situated at the extremity of Gaul and peopled with foreigners could have  but little influence over so vast a country and its inhabitants.  At  first civilization is very hard and very slow; it requires many  centuries, many great events, and many years of toil to overcome the  early habits of a people, and cause them to exchange the pleasures, gross  indeed, but accompanied with the idleness and freedom of barbarian life,  for the toilful advantages of a regulated social condition.  By dint of  foresight, perseverance, and courage, the merchants of Marseilles and her  colonies crossed by two or three main lines the forests, morasses, and  heaths through the savage tribes of Gauls, and there effected their  exchanges, but to the right and left they penetrated but a short  distance.  Even on their main lines their traces soon disappeared; and at  the commercial settlements which they established here and there they  were often far more occupied in self-defence than in spreading their  example.  Beyond a strip of land of uneven breadth, along the  Mediterranean, and save the space peopled towards the south-west by the  Iberians, the country, which received its name from the former of the  two, was occupied by the Gauls and the Kymrians; by the Gauls in the  centre, south-east and east, in the highlands of modern France, between  the Alps, the Vosges, the mountains of Auvergne and the Cevennes; by the  Kymrians in the north, north-west, and west, in the lowlands, from the  western boundary of the Gauls to the ocean.    Whether the Gauls and the Kymrians were originally of the same race, or  at least of races closely connected; whether they were both anciently  comprised under the general name of Celts; and whether the Kymrians, if  they were not of the same race as the Gauls, belonged to that of the  Germans, the final conquerors of the Roman empire, are questions which  the learned have been a long, long while discussing without deciding.  The only facts which seem to be clear and certain are the following.    The ancients for a long while applied without distinction the name of  Celts to the peoples who lived in the west and north of Europe,  regardless of precise limits, language, or origin.  It was a geographical  title applicable to a vast but ill-explored territory, rather than a real  historical name of race or nation.  And so, in the earliest times, Gauls,  Germans, Bretons, and even Iberians, appear frequently confounded under  the name of Celts, peoples of Celtica.    Little by little this name is observed to become more restricted and more  precise.  The Iberians of Spain are the first to be detached; then the  Germans.  In the century preceding the Christian era, the Gauls, that is,  the peoples inhabiting Gaul, are alone called Celts.  We begin even to  recognize amongst them diversities of race, and to distinguish the  Iberians of Gaul, alias Aquitanians, and the Kymrians or Belgians from  the Gauls, to whom the name of Celts is confined.  Sometimes even it is  to a confederation of certain Gallic tribes that the name Specially  applies.  However it be, the Gauls appear to have been the first  inhabitants of western Europe.  In the most ancient historical memorials  they are found there, and not only in Gaul, but in Great Britain, in  Ireland, and in the neighboring islets.  In Gaul, after a long  predominance, they commingled with other races to form the French nation.  But, in this commingling numerous traces of their language, monuments,  manners, and names of persons and places, survived and still exist,  especially to the east and south--cast, in local customs and vernacular  dialects.  In Ireland, in the highlands of Scotland, in the Hebrides and  the Isle of Man, Gauls (Gaels) still live under their primitive name.  There we still have the Gaelic race and tongue, free, if not from any  change, at least from absorbent fusion.    From the seventh to the fourth century B.C., a new population spread over  Gaul, not at once, but by a series of invasions, of which the two  principal took place at the two extremes of that epoch.  They called  themselves Kymrians or Kimrians, whence the Romans made Cimbrians, which  recalls Cimmerii or Cimmerians, the name of a people whom the Greeks  placed on the western bank of the Black Sea and in the Cimmerian  peninsula, called to this day Crimea.  During these irregular and  successively repeated movements of wandering populations, it often  happened that tribes of different races met, made terms, united, and  finished by amalgamation under one name.  All the peoples that  successively invaded Europe, Gauls, Kymrians, Germans, belonged at first,  in Asia, whence they came, to a common stern; the diversity of their  languages, traditions, and manners, great as it already was at the time  of their appearance in the West, was the work of time and of the diverse  circumstances in the midst of which they had lived; but there always  remained amongst them traces of a primitive affinity which allowed of  sudden and frequent comings, amidst their tumultuous dispersion.    The Kymrians, who crossed the Rhine and flung themselves into northern  Gaul towards the middle of the fourth century B.C., called themselves  Bolg, or Belg, or Belgians, a name which indeed is given to them by Roman  writers, and which has remained that of the country they first invaded.  They descended southwards, to the banks of the Seine and the Marne.  There they encountered the Kymrians of former invasions, who not only had  spread over the country comprised between the Seine and the Loire, to the  very heart of the peninsula bordered by the latter river, but had crossed  the sea, and occupied a portion of the large island opposite Gaul,  crowding back the Gauls, who had preceded them, upon Ireland and the  highlands of Scotland.  It was from one of these tribes and its  chieftain, called Pryd or Prydain, Brit or Britain, that Great Britain  and Brittany in France received the name which they have kept.    Each of these races, far from forming a single people bound to the same  destiny and under the same chieftains, split into peoplets, more or less  independent, who foregathered or separated according to the shifts of  circumstances, and who pursued, each on their own account and at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11952"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 2 (#3)"],[1,"to the king to embark  the crusaders; but, when the vessels arrived, they were quite inadequate  for such an operation; hardly could the king, the barons, and the knights  find room in them; and it would be necessary to abandon and expose to the  perils of the land-march the majority of the infantry and all the mere  pilgrims who had followed the army.  Louis, disconsolate, fluctuated  between the most diverse resolutions, at one time demanding to have  everybody embarked at any risk, at another determining to march by land  himself with all who could not be embarked; distributing whatever money  and provisions he had left, being as generous and sympathetic as he was  improvident and incapable, and \"never letting a day pass,\" says Odo of  Deuil, who accompanied him, \"without hearing mass and crying unto the God  of the Christians.\"  At last he embarked with his queen, Eleanor, and his  principal knights; and towards the end of March, 1148, he arrived at  Antioch, having lost more than three quarters of his army.    Scarcely had he taken a few days' rest when messengers came to him on  behalf of Baldwin III., king of Jerusalem, begging him to repair without  delay to the Holy City.  Louis was as eager to go thither as the king and  people of Jerusalem were to see him there; but his speedy departure  encountered unforeseen hinderances.  Raymond, of Poitiers, at that time  Prince of Antioch by his marriage with Constance, granddaughter of the  great Bohemond of the first crusade, was uncle to the Queen of France,  Eleanor of Aquitaine.  He was, says William of Tyre, \"a lord of noble  descent, of tall and elegant figure, the handsomest of the princes of the  earth, a man of charming affability and conversation, open-handed and  magnificent beyond measure,\" and, moreover, ambitious and eager to extend  his small dominion.  He had at heart, beyond everything, the conquest of  Aleppo and Caesarea.  In this design the King of France and the crusaders  who were still about him might be of real service; and he attempted to  win them over.  Louis answered that he would engage in no enterprise  until he had visited the holy places.  Raymond was impetuous, irritable,  and as unreasonable in his desires as unfortunate in his undertakings.  He had quickly acquired great influence over his niece, Queen Eleanor,  and he had no difficulty in winning her over to his plans.  \"She,\" says  William of Tyre, \"was a very inconsiderate woman, caring little for royal  dignity or conjugal fidelity; she took great pleasure in the court of  Antioch, where she also conferred much pleasure, even upon Mussulmans,  whom, as some chronicles say, she did not repulse; and, when the king,  her husband, spoke to her of approaching departure, she emphatically  refused, and, to justify her opposition, she declared that they could no  longer live together, as there was, she asserted, a prohibited degree of  consanguinity between them.\"  Louis, \"who loved her with an almost  excessive love,\" says William of Nangis, was at the same time angered and  grieved.  He was austere in morals, easily jealous, and religiously  scrupulous, and for a moment he was on the point of separating from his  wife; but the counsels of his chief barons dissuaded him, and, thereupon,  taking a sudden resolution, he set out from Antioch secretly, by night,  carrying off the queen almost by force.  \"They both hid their wrath as  much as possible,\" says the chronicler; \"but at heart they had ever this  outrage.\"  We shall see, before long, what were the consequences.  No  history can offer so striking an example of the importance of  well-assorted unions amongst the highest as well as the lowest, and of  the prolonged woes which may be brought upon a nation by the domestic  evils of royalty.    On approaching Jerusalem, in the month of April, 1148, Louis VII. saw  coming to meet him King Baldwin III., and the patriarch and the people,  singing, \"Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord!\"  So soon  as he had entered the city, his pious wishes were fulfilled by his being  taken to pay a solemn visit to all the holy places.  At the same time  arrived from Constantinople the Emperor Conrad, almost alone and in the  guise of a simple pilgrim.  All the remnant of the crusaders, French and  German, hurried to join them.  Impatient to exhibit their power on the  theatre of their creed, and to render to the kingdom of Jerusalem some  striking service, the two Western sovereigns, and Baldwin, and their  principal barons assembled at Ptolemais (St. Jean d'Acre) to determine  the direction to be taken by their enterprise.  They decided upon the  siege of Damascus, the most important and the nearest of the Mussulman  princedoms in Syria, and in the early part of June they moved thither  with forces incomplete and ill united.  Neither the Prince of Antioch nor  the Counts of Edessa and Tripolis had been summoned to St. Jean d'Acre;  and Queen Eleanor had not appeared.  At the first attack, the ardor of  the assailants and the brilliant personal prowess of their chiefs, of the  Emperor Conrad amongst others, struck surprise and consternation into the  besieged, who, foreseeing the necessity of abandoning their city, laid  across the streets beams, chains, and heaps of stones, to stop the  progress of the conquerors and give themselves time for flying, with  their families and their wealth, by the northern and southern gates.  But  personal interest and secret negotiations before long brought into the  Christian camp weakness, together with discord.  Many of the barons were  already disputing amongst themselves, at the very elbows of the  sovereigns, for the future government of Damascus; others were not  inaccessible to the rich offers which came to them from the city; and it  is maintained that King Baldwin himself suffered himself to be bribed by  a sum of two hundred thousand pieces of gold which were sent to him by  Modjer-Eddyn, Emir of Damascus, and which turned out to be only pieces of  copper, covered with gold leaf.  News came that the Emirs of Aleppo and  Mossoul were coming, with considerable forces, to the relief of the  place.  Whatever may have been the cause of retreat, the crusader-  sovereigns decided upon it, and, raising the siege, returned to  Jerusalem.  The Emperor Conrad, in indignation and confusion, set out  precipitately to return to Germany.  King Louis could not make up his  mind thus to quit the Holy Land in disgrace, and without doing anything  for its deliverance.  He prolonged his stay there for more than a year  without anything to show for his time and zeal.  His barons and his  knights nearly all left him, and, by sea or land, made their way back to  France.  But the king still lingered.  I am under a bond,\" he wrote to  Suger, \"not to leave the Holy Land, save with glory, and after doing  somewhat for the cause of God and the kingdom of France.\"  At last, after  many fruitless entreaties, Suger wrote to him, \"Dear king and lord, I  must cause thee to hear the voice of thy whole kingdom.  Why dost thou  fly from us?  After having toiled so hard in the East, after having  endured so many almost unendurable evils, by what harshness or what  cruelty comes it that, now when the barons and grandees of the kingdom  have returned, thou persistest in abiding with the barbarians?  The  disturbers of the kingdom have entered into it again; and thou, who  shouldst defend it, remainest in exile as if thou wert a prisoner; thou  givest over the lamb to the wolf, thy dominions to the ravishers.  We  conjure thy majesty, we invoke thy piety, we adjure thy goodness, we  summon thee in the name of the fealty we owe thee; tarry not at all, or  only a little while, beyond Easter; else thou wilt appear, in the eyes of  God, guilty of a breach of that oath which thou didst take at the same  time as the crown.\"  At length Louis made up his mind and embarked at St.  Jean d'Acre at the commencement of July, 1149; and he disembarked in the  month of October at the port of St. Gilles, at the mouth of the Rhone,  whence he wrote to Suger, \"We be hastening unto you safe and sound, and  we command you not to defer paying us a visit, on a given day and before  all our other friends.  Many rumors reach us touching our kingdom, and  knowing nought for certain, we be desirous to learn from you how we  should bear ourselves or hold our peace, in every case.  And let none but  yourself know what I say to you at this present writing.\"    This preference and this confidence were no more than Louis VII. owed to  Suger.  The Abbot of St. Denis, after having opposed the crusade with a  freedom of spirit and a far-sightedness unique, perhaps, in his times,  had, during the king's absence, borne the weight of government with a  political tact, a firmness, and a disinterestedness rare in any times.  He had upheld the authority of absent royalty, kept down the pretensions  of vassals, and established some degree of order wherever his influence  could reach; he had provided for the king's expenses in Palestine by good  administration of the domains and revenues of the crown; and, lastly, he  had acquired such renown in Europe, that men came from Italy and from  England to view the salutary effects of his government, and that the name  of Solomon of his age was conferred upon him by strangers his  contemporaries.  With the exception of great sovereigns, such as  Charlemagne or William the Conqueror, only great bishops or learned  theologians, and that by their influence in the Church or by their  writings, had obtained this European reputation; from the ninth to the  twelfth century, Suger was the first man who attained to it by the sole  merit of his political conduct, and who offered an example of a minister  justly admired, for his ability and wisdom, beyond the circle in which he  lived.  When he saw that the king's return drew near, he wrote to him,  saying, \"You will, I think,"]]]
