Doyne set the lamp on the ground and the three bent down together over  the man. Close by the neck lay the rest of the broken bottle, whose  contents had evidently run out into the snow.    \"Drunk?\" asked Biggleswade.    Doyne felt the man and laid his hand on his heart.    \"No,\" said he, \"dead.\"    McCurdie leaped to his full height. \"I told you the place was uncanny!\"  he cried. \"It's fey.\" Then he hammered wildly at the door.    There was no response. He hammered again till it rattled. This time a  faint prolonged sound like the wailing of a strange sea-creature was  heard from within the house. McCurdie turned round, his teeth  chattering.    \"Did ye hear that, Doyne?\"      [Illustration: I TOLD YOU THE PLACE WAS UNCANNY.]      \"Perhaps it's a dog,\" said the Professor.    Lord Doyne, the man of action, pushed them aside and tried the  door-handle. It yielded, the door stood open, and the gust of cold wind  entering the house extinguished the candle within. They entered and  found themselves in a miserable stone-paved kitchen, furnished with  poverty-stricken meagreness--a wooden chair or two, a dirty table, some  broken crockery, old cooking utensils, a fly-blown missionary society  almanac, and a fireless grate. Doyne set the lamp on the table.    \"We must bring him in,\" said he.    They returned to the threshold, and as they were bending over to grip  the dead man the same sound filled the air, but this time louder, more  intense, a cry of great agony. The sweat dripped from McCurdie's  forehead. They lifted the dead man and brought him into the room, and  after laying him on a dirty strip of carpet they did their best to  straighten the stiff limbs. Biggleswade put on the table a bundle which  he had picked up outside. It contained some poor provisions--a loaf, a  piece of fat bacon, and a paper of tea. As far as they could guess (and  as they learned later they guessed rightly) the man was the master of  the house, who, coming home blind drunk from some distant inn, had  fallen at his own threshold and got frozen to death. As they could not  unclasp his fingers from the broken bottleneck they had to let him  clutch it as a dead warrior clutches the hilt of his broken sword.    Then suddenly the whole place was rent with another and yet another  long, soul-piercing moan of anguish.    \"There's a second room,\" said Doyne, pointing to a door. \"The sound  comes from there.\" He opened the door, peeped in, and then, returning  for the lamp, disappeared, leaving McCurdie and Biggleswade in the pitch  darkness, with the dead man on the floor.    \"For heaven's sake, give me a drop of whiskey,\" said the Professor, \"or  I shall faint.\"    Presently the door opened and Lord Doyne appeared in the shaft of light.  He beckoned to his companions.    \"It is a woman in childbirth,\" he said in his even, tired voice. \"We  must aid her. She appears unconscious. Does either of you know anything  about such things?\"    They shook their heads, and the three looked at each other in dismay.  Masters of knowledge that had won them world-wide fame and honour, they  stood helpless, abashed before this, the commonest phenomenon of nature.    \"My wife had no child,\" said McCurdie.    \"I've avoided women all my life,\" said Biggleswade.    \"And I've been too busy to think of them. God forgive me,\" said Doyne.           *       *       *       *       *    The history of the next two hours was one that none of the three men  ever cared to touch upon. They did things blindly, instinctively, as men  do when they come face to face with the elemental. A fire was made, they  knew not how, water drawn they knew not whence, and a kettle boiled.  Doyne accustomed to command, directed. The others obeyed. At his  suggestion they hastened to the wreck of the car and came staggering  back beneath rugs and travelling bags which could supply clean linen and  needful things, for amid the poverty of the house they could find  nothing fit for human touch or use. Early they saw that the woman's  strength was failing, and that she could not live. And there, in that  nameless hovel, with death on the hearthstone and death and life  hovering over the pitiful bed, the three great men went through the pain  and the horror and squalor of birth, and they knew that they had never  yet stood before so great a mystery.    With the first wail of the newly born infant a last convulsive shudder  passed through the frame of the unconscious mother. Then three or four  short gasps for breath, and the spirit passed away. She was dead.  Professor Biggleswade threw a corner of the sheet over her face, for he  could not bear to see it.    They washed and dried the child as any crone of a midwife would have  done, and dipped a small sponge which had always remained unused in a  cut-glass bottle in Doyne's dressing-bag in the hot milk and water of  Biggleswade's thermos bottle, and put it to his lips; and then they  wrapped him up warm in some of their own woollen undergarments, and took  him into the kitchen and placed him on a bed made of their fur coats in  front of the fire. As the last piece of fuel was exhausted they took one  of the wooden chairs and broke it up and cast it into the blaze. And  then they raised the dead man from the strip of carpet and carried him  into the bedroom and laid him reverently by the side of his dead wife,  after which they left the dead in darkness and returned to the living.  And the three grave men stood over the wisp of flesh that had been born  a male into the world. Then, their task being accomplished, reaction  came, and even Doyne, who had seen death in many lands, turned faint.  But the others, losing control of their nerves, shook like men stricken  with palsy.    Suddenly McCurdie cried in a high pitched voice, \"My God! Don't you feel  it?\" and clutched Doyne by the arm. An expression of terror appeared on  his iron features.    \"There! It's here with us.\"    Little Professor Biggleswade sat on a corner of the table and wiped his  forehead.    \"I heard it. I felt it. It was like the beating of wings.\"    \"It's the fourth time,\" said McCurdie. \"The first time was just before I  accepted the Deverills' invitation. The second in the railway carriage  this afternoon. The third on the way here. This is the fourth.\"    Biggleswade plucked nervously at the fringe of whisker under his jaws  and said faintly, \"It's the fourth time up to now. I thought it was  fancy.\"    \"I have felt it, too,\" said Doyne. \"It is the Angel of Death.\" And he  pointed to the room where the dead man and woman lay.    \"For God's sake let us get away from this,\" cried Biggleswade.    \"And leave the child to die, like the others?\" said Doyne.    \"We must see it through,\" said McCurdie.           *       *       *       *       *    A silence fell upon them as they sat round in the blaze with the  new-born babe wrapped in its odd swaddling clothes asleep on the pile of  fur coats, and it lasted until Sir Angus McCurdie looked at his watch.    \"Good Lord,\" said he, \"it's twelve o'clock.\"    \"Christmas morning,\" said Biggleswade.    \"A strange Christmas,\" mused Doyne.    McCurdie put up his hand. \"There it is again! The beating of wings.\" And  they listened like men spellbound. McCurdie kept his hand uplifted, and  gazed over their heads at the wall, and his gaze was that of a man in a  trance, and he spoke:    \"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given--\"    Doyne sprang from his chair, which fell behind him with a crash.    \"Man--what the devil are you saying?\"    Then McCurdie rose and met Biggleswade's eyes staring at him through the  great round spectacles, and Biggleswade turned and met the eyes of  Doyne. A pulsation like the beating of wings stirred the air.    The three wise men shivered with a queer exaltation. Something strange,  mystical, dynamic had happened. It was as if scales had fallen from  their eyes and they saw with a new vision. They stood together humbly,  divested of all their greatness, touching one another in the instinctive  fashion of children, as if seeking mutual protection, and they looked,  with one accord, irresistibly compelled, at the child.    At last McCurdie unbent his black brows and said hoarsely:    \"It was not the Angel of Death, Doyne, but another Messenger that drew  us here.\"    The tiredness seemed to pass away from the great administrator's face,  and he nodded his head with the calm of a man who has come to the quiet  heart of a perplexing mystery.    \"It's true,\" he murmured. \"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is  given. Unto the three of us.\"    Biggleswade took off his great round spectacles and wiped them.    \"Gaspar, Melchior, Balthazar. But where are the gold, frankincense and  myrrh?\"    \"In our hearts, man,\" said McCurdie.    The babe cried and stretched its tiny limbs.      [Illustration: INSTINCTIVELY THEY ALL KNELT DOWN.]      Instinctively they all knelt down together to discover, if possible, and  administer ignorantly to, its wants. The scene had the appearance of an  adoration.           *       *       *       *       *    Then these three wise, lonely, childless men who, in furtherance of  their own greatness, had cut themselves adrift from the sweet and simple  things of life and from the kindly ways of their brethren, and had grown  old in unhappy and profitless wisdom, knew that an inscrutable  Providence had led them, as it had led three Wise Men of old, on a  Christmas morning long ago, to a nativity which should give them a new  wisdom, a new link with humanity, a new spiritual outlook, a new hope.    And, when their watch was ended, they wrapped up the babe with precious  care, and carried him with them, an inalienable joy and possession, into  the great world.

The boxes should be covered with panes of glass till the  seedlings are well started, and should be kept at a temperature of from  65 deg. to 70 deg. Fahr. It is very important to keep them covered while  the seeds are germinating, otherwise the sand will be certain to become  too dry if kept in a sufficiently warm place. Light is not necessary, and  in winter time the neighborhood of the furnace is often a very convenient  place to keep them safe from frost. They should not be in the sun while  germinating. When the first sprouts appear above the ground let another  set be planted, and so on, till a series is obtained ranging from plants  several inches high to those just starting from the seed. The seeds  themselves should be soaked for a day and the series is then ready  for study. The time required for their growth varies according to the  temperature, moisture, etc. Dr. Goodale says they should be ready in ten  days.[1]    [Footnote 1: Concerning a few Common Plants, by G.L. Goodale, Boston, D.C.  Heath & Co. This little book, which is published, in pamphlet form, for  fifteen cents, will be found exceedingly useful.]    I have never been able to raise them so quickly in the schoolroom, nor  have the pupils to whom I have given them to plant done so at home.  Generally, it is three weeks, at least, before the first specimens are as  large as is desirable.    Germinating seeds need warmth, moisture and air. The necessary conditions  are supplied in the very best way by growing them on sponge, but it would  be difficult to raise enough for a large class in this manner. Place a  piece of moist sponge in a jelly-glass, or any glass that is larger at the  top, so that the sponge may not sink to the bottom, and pour some water  into the glass, but not so much as to touch the sponge. The whole should  be covered with a larger inverted glass, which must not be so close as  to prevent a circulation of air. The plants can thus be watched at every  stage and some should always be grown in this way. The water in the  tumbler will keep the sponge damp, and the roots, after emerging from  the sponge, will grow well in the moist air. Seeds can also be grown on  blotting paper. Put the seeds on several thicknesses of moist blotting  paper on a plate, cover them with more moist paper, and invert another  plate over them, taking care to allow the free entrance of air.    If possible, it is by far the best way to have the seeds growing in the  schoolroom, and make it a regular custom for the pupils to observe them  every morning and take notes of their growth.    These lessons on seeds are suitable for pupils of every age, from adults  to the youngest children who go to school. The difference should be only  in the mode of treatment; but the same principles should be brought out,  whatever the age and power of comprehension of the pupil.    For these lessons the following seeds should be planted, according to the  above directions:    Morning-Glory, Sunflower or Squash, Bean, Pea, Red Clover, Flax, Corn,  Wheat, and Oats.[1] If they can be procured plant also acorns, Pine-seeds,  Maple-seeds, and horsechestnuts.    [Footnote 1: A package of these seeds may be obtained for fifty cents,  from Joseph Breck & Son, Boston, Mass. They will be sent by mail, postage  paid.]      2. _Study of Morning-Glory, Sunflower, Bean, and Pea_.--For reasons  hereafter given, I consider the Morning-Glory the best seedling to begin  upon. Having a series, as above described, before them, the pupils should  draw the seedlings. When the drawings are made, let them letter alike the  corresponding parts, beginning with the plantlet in the seed, and using  new letters when a new part is developed. The seed coats need not be  lettered, as they do not belong to the plantlet.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Germination of Morning Glory, _a_, caulicle; _b_,  cotyledons; _c_, plumule; _d_, roots.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Germination of Sunflower.]    After drawing the Morning-Glory series, let them draw the Sunflower or  Squash in the same way, then the Bean, and finally the Pea. Let them write  answers to the following questions:    MORNING-GLORY.[1]    [Footnote 1: It has been objected that the Morning-Glory seed is too small  to begin upon. If the teacher prefer, he may begin with the Squash, Bean,  and Pea. The questions will require but little alteration, and he can take  up the Morning-Glory later.]    Tell the parts of the Morning-Glory seed.    What part grows first?    What becomes of the seed-covering?    What appears between the first pair of leaves?    Was this to be seen in the seed?    How many leaves are there at each joint of stem after the first pair?    How do they differ from the first pair?    SUNFLOWER OR SQUASH.    What are the parts of the seed?    What is there in the Morning-Glory seed that this has not?    How do the first leaves change as the seedling grows?      BEAN.    What are the parts of the seed?    How does this differ from the Morning-Glory seed?    How from the Sunflower seed?    How do the first pair of leaves of the Bean change as they grow?    How many leaves are there at each joint of stem?[1]    [Footnote 1: There are two simple leaves at the next node to the  cotyledons; after these there is one compound leaf at each node.]    How do they differ from the first pair?      PEA.    What are the parts of the seed? Compare it with the Morning-Glory,  Sunflower, and Bean.    How does it differ in its growth from the Bean?    What have all these four seeds in common?    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Germination of Pea. _a_, caulicle; _b_,  cotyledons; _c_, plumule; _d_, roots.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Germination of Bean.]    What has the Morning-Glory seed that the others have not?    What have the Bean and Pea that the Morning-Glory has not?    How does the Pea differ from all the others in its growth?    What part grows first in all these seeds?    From which part do the roots grow?    What peculiarity do you notice in the way they come up out of the  ground?[1]    [Footnote 1: This question refers to the arched form in which they come  up. In this way the tender, growing apex is not rubbed.]    The teacher must remember that, unless the pupils have had some previous  training, they will first have to learn to use their eyes, and for this  they will need much judicious help. They should be assisted to see what is  before them, not told what is there. It is absolutely necessary that these  questions should be thoroughly understood and correctly answered before  any conclusions are drawn from them. For this purpose abundant material is  indispensable. It is better not to attempt these lessons on seeds at  all, unless there is material enough for personal observation by all the  pupils.    After this preliminary work has been done, the names of the parts can  be given to the pupils. They may be written under each drawing  thus,--A=Caulicle;[1] B=Cotyledons; C=Roots; D=Plumule. The whole plantlet  in the seed is the _embryo_ or _germ_, whence the sprouting of seeds is  called _germination_.    [Footnote 1: The term radicle is still in general use. The derivation  (little root) makes it undesirable. Dr. Gray has adopted caulicle (little  stem) in the latest edition of his text-book, which I have followed. Other  writers use the term hypocotyl, meaning under the cotyledons.]    I consider this the best order to study the seeds because in the  Morning-Glory the cotyledons are plainly leaves in the seed; and in the  Squash or Sunflower[2] the whole process is plainly to be seen whereby  a thick body, most unlike a leaf, becomes an ordinary green leaf with  veins.[3] In the Sunflower the true leaves are nearly the same shape as  the cotyledons, so that this is an especially good illustration for the  purpose. Thus, without any hint from me, my pupils often write of the  Bean, \"it has two thick leaves and two thin leaves.\" In this way the Bean  and Pea present no difficulty. The cotyledons in the first make apparently  an unsuccessful effort to become leaves, which the second give up  altogether.    [Footnote 2: The large Russian Sunflower is the best for the purpose.]    [Footnote 3: These lessons are intended, as has been said, for children  over twelve years of age. If they are adapted for younger ones, it is  especially important to begin with a seed where the leaf-like character  of the cotyledons is evident, or becomes so. Maple is excellent for the  purpose. Morning-Glory is too small. Squash will answer very well. I think  it characteristic of the minds of little children to associate a term with  the first specimen to which it is applied. If the term cotyledon be given  them first for those of the Bean and Pea they will say when they come to  the Morning-Glory, \"but those are _leaves_, not cotyledons. Cotyledons are  large and round.\" It will be very difficult to make them understand that  cotyledons are the first seed-leaves, and they will feel as if it were a  forced connection, and one that they cannot see for themselves.]    The teacher's object now is to make the pupils understand the meaning of  the answers they have given to these questions. In the first place, they  should go over their answers and substitute the botanical terms they have  just learned for the ones they have used.
