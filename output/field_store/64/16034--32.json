[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/92"],[0,"Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar (#20)"],[1," jungle he struck out directly eastward.    A few miles south of him, Jane Clayton lay panting among the branches  of a tree in which she had taken refuge from a prowling and hungry  lioness.    Her escape from the village had been much easier than she had  anticipated.  The knife which she had used to cut her way through the  brush wall of the hut to freedom she had found sticking in the wall of  her prison, doubtless left there by accident when a former tenant had  vacated the premises.    To cross the rear of the village, keeping always in the densest  shadows, had required but a few moments, and the fortunate circumstance  of the discovery of the hut poles lying so near the palisade had solved  for her the problem of the passage of the high wall.    For an hour she had followed the old game trail toward the south, until  there fell upon her trained hearing the stealthy padding of a stalking  beast behind her.  The nearest tree gave her instant sanctuary, for she  was too wise in the ways of the jungle to chance her safety for a  moment after discovering that she was being hunted.    Werper, with better success, traveled slowly onward until dawn, when,  to his chagrin, he discovered a mounted Arab upon his trail.  It was  one of Achmet Zek's minions, many of whom were scattered in all  directions through the forest, searching for the fugitive Belgian.    Jane Clayton's escape had not yet been discovered when Achmet Zek and  his searchers set forth to overhaul Werper. The only man who had seen  the Belgian after his departure from his tent was the black sentry  before the doorway of Lady Greystoke's prison hut, and he had been  silenced by the discovery of the dead body of the man who had relieved  him, the sentry that Mugambi had dispatched.    The bribe taker naturally inferred that Werper had slain his fellow and  dared not admit that he had permitted him to enter the hut, fearing as  he did, the anger of Achmet Zek. So, as chance directed that he should  be the one to discover the body of the sentry when the first alarm had  been given following Achmet Zek's discovery that Werper had outwitted  him, the crafty black had dragged the dead body to the interior of a  nearby tent, and himself resumed his station before the doorway of the  hut in which he still believed the woman to be.    With the discovery of the Arab close behind him, the Belgian hid in the  foliage of a leafy bush.  Here the trail ran straight for a  considerable distance, and down the shady forest aisle, beneath the  overarching branches of the trees, rode the white-robed figure of the  pursuer.    Nearer and nearer he came.  Werper crouched closer to the ground behind  the leaves of his hiding place.  Across the trail a vine moved.  Werper's eyes instantly centered upon the spot.  There was no wind to  stir the foliage in the depths of the jungle.  Again the vine moved.  In the mind of the Belgian only the presence of a sinister and  malevolent force could account for the phenomenon.    The man's eyes bored steadily into the screen of leaves upon the  opposite side of the trail.  Gradually a form took shape beyond them--a  tawny form, grim and terrible, with yellow-green eyes glaring  fearsomely across the narrow trail straight into his.    Werper could have screamed in fright, but up the trail was coming the  messenger of another death, equally sure and no less terrible.  He  remained silent, almost paralyzed by fear. The Arab approached.  Across  the trail from Werper the lion crouched for the spring, when suddenly  his attention was attracted toward the horseman.    The Belgian saw the massive head turn in the direction of the raider  and his heart all but ceased its beating as he awaited the result of  this interruption.  At a walk the horseman approached.  Would the  nervous animal he rode take fright at the odor of the carnivore, and,  bolting, leave Werper still to the mercies of the king of beasts?    But he seemed unmindful of the near presence of the great cat.  On he  came, his neck arched, champing at the bit between his teeth.  The  Belgian turned his eyes again toward the lion.  The beast's whole  attention now seemed riveted upon the horseman.  They were abreast the  lion now, and still the brute did not spring.  Could he be but waiting  for them to pass before returning his attention to the original prey?  Werper shuddered and half rose.  At the same instant the lion sprang  from his place of concealment, full upon the mounted man.  The horse,  with a shrill neigh of terror, shrank sideways almost upon the Belgian,  the lion dragged the helpless Arab from his saddle, and the horse  leaped back into the trail and fled away toward the west.    But he did not flee alone.  As the frightened beast had pressed in upon  him, Werper had not been slow to note the quickly emptied saddle and  the opportunity it presented. Scarcely had the lion dragged the Arab  down from one side, than the Belgian, seizing the pommel of the saddle  and the horse's mane, leaped upon the horse's back from the other.    A half hour later a naked giant, swinging easily through the lower  branches of the trees, paused, and with raised head, and dilating  nostrils sniffed the morning air.  The smell of blood fell strong upon  his senses, and mingled with it was the scent of Numa, the lion.  The  giant cocked his head upon one side and listened.    From a short distance up the trail came the unmistakable noises of the  greedy feeding of a lion.  The crunching of bones, the gulping of great  pieces, the contented growling, all attested the nearness of the king  at table.    Tarzan approached the spot, still keeping to the branches of the trees.  He made no effort to conceal his approach, and presently he had  evidence that Numa had heard him, from the ominous, rumbling warning  that broke from a thicket beside the trail.    Halting upon a low branch just above the lion Tarzan looked down upon  the grisly scene.  Could this unrecognizable thing be the man he had  been trailing?  The ape-man wondered.  From time to time he had  descended to the trail and verified his judgment by the evidence of his  scent that the Belgian had followed this game trail toward the east.    Now he proceeded beyond the lion and his feast, again descended and  examined the ground with his nose.  There was no scent spoor here of  the man he had been trailing. Tarzan returned to the tree.  With keen  eyes he searched the ground about the mutilated corpse for a sign of  the missing pouch of pretty pebbles; but naught could he see of it.    He scolded Numa and tried to drive the great beast away; but only angry  growls rewarded his efforts.  He tore small branches from a nearby limb  and hurled them at his ancient enemy.  Numa looked up with bared fangs,  grinning hideously, but he did not rise from his kill.    Then Tarzan fitted an arrow to his bow, and drawing the slim shaft far  back let drive with all the force of the tough wood that only he could  bend.  As the arrow sank deeply into his side, Numa leaped to his feet  with a roar of mingled rage and pain.  He leaped futilely at the  grinning ape-man, tore at the protruding end of the shaft, and then,  springing into the trail, paced back and forth beneath his tormentor.  Again Tarzan loosed a swift bolt.  This time the missile, aimed with  care, lodged in the lion's spine.  The great creature halted in its  tracks, and lurched awkwardly forward upon its face, paralyzed.    Tarzan dropped to the trail, ran quickly to the beast's side, and drove  his spear deep into the fierce heart, then after recovering his arrows  turned his attention to the mutilated remains of the animal's prey in  the nearby thicket.    The face was gone.  The Arab garments aroused no doubt as to the man's  identity, since he had trailed him into the Arab camp and out again,  where he might easily have acquired the apparel.  So sure was Tarzan  that the body was that of he who had robbed him that he made no effort  to verify his deductions by scent among the conglomerate odors of the  great carnivore and the fresh blood of the victim.    He confined his attentions to a careful search for the pouch, but  nowhere upon or about the corpse was any sign of the missing article or  its contents.  The ape-man was disappointed--possibly not so much  because of the loss of the colored pebbles as with Numa for robbing him  of the pleasures of revenge.    Wondering what could have become of his possessions, the ape-man turned  slowly back along the trail in the direction from which he had come.  In his mind he revolved a plan to enter and search the Arab camp, after  darkness had again fallen.  Taking to the trees, he moved directly  south in search of prey, that he might satisfy his hunger before  midday, and then lie up for the afternoon in some spot far from the  camp, where he might sleep without fear of discovery until it came time  to prosecute his design.    Scarcely had he quitted the trail when a tall, black warrior, moving at  a dogged trot, passed toward the east.  It was Mugambi, searching for  his mistress.  He continued along the trail, halting to examine the  body of the dead lion.  An expression of puzzlement crossed his  features as he bent to search for the wounds which had caused the death  of the jungle lord.  Tarzan had removed his arrows, but to Mugambi the  proof of death was as strong as though both the lighter missiles and  the spear still protruded from the carcass.    The black looked furtively about him.  The body was still warm, and  from this fact he reasoned that the killer was close at hand, yet no  sign of living man appeared.  Mugambi shook his head, and continued  along the trail, but with redoubled caution.    All day he traveled, stopping occasionally to call aloud the single  word, \"Lady,\" in the hope that at last she might hear and respond; but  in the end his loyal devotion brought him to disaster.

Some friend lies at death's door;  but if you chase it out of sight, your friend will recover  after a long and lingering sickness.    To hear the scream or the mewing of a cat, some false friend is using  all the words and work at his command to do you harm.    To dream that a cat scratches you, an enemy will succeed in wrenching  from you the profits of a deal that you have spent many days making.
