The play is somewhat Satyric in character._\"        ALCESTIS      _The scene represents the ancient Castle of_ ADMETUS _near Pherae  in Thessaly. It is the dusk before dawn_; APOLLO, _radiant in the  darkness, looks at the Castle._      APOLLO.  Admetus' House! 'Twas here I bowed my head  Of old, and chafed not at the bondman's bread,  Though born in heaven. Aye, Zeus to death had hurled  My son, Asclepios, Healer of the World,  Piercing with fire his heart; and in mine ire  I slew his Cyclop churls, who forged the fire.  Whereat Zeus cast me forth to bear the yoke  Of service to a mortal. To this folk  I came, and watched a stranger's herd for pay,  And all his house I have prospered to this day.  For innocent was the Lord I chanced upon  And clean as mine own heart, King Pheres' son,  Admetus. Him I rescued from the grave,  Beguiling the Grey Sisters till they gave  A great oath that Admetus should go free,  Would he but pay to Them Below in fee  Another living soul. Long did he prove  All that were his, and all that owed him love,  But never a soul he found would yield up life  And leave the sunlight for him, save his wife:  Who, even now, down the long galleries  Is borne, death-wounded; for this day it is  She needs must pass out of the light and die.  And, seeing the stain of death must not come nigh  My radiance, I must leave this house I love.    But ha! The Headsman of the Pit, above  Earth's floor, to ravish her! Aye, long and late  He hath watched, and cometh at the fall of fate.    _Enter from the other side_ THANATOS; _a crouching black-haired and  winged figure, carrying a drawn sword. He starts in revulsion on  seeing_ APOLLO.      THANATOS.  Aha!  Why here? What mak'st thou at the gate,    Thou Thing of Light? Wilt overtread  The eternal judgment, and abate    And spoil the portions of the dead?  'Tis not enough for thee to have blocked    In other days Admetus' doom  With craft of magic wine, which mocked    The three grey Sisters of the Tomb;      But now once more    I see thee stand at watch, and shake    That arrow-armed hand to make  This woman thine, who swore, who swore,    To die now for her husband's sake.      APOLLO.  Fear not.  I bring fair words and seek but what is just.    THANATOS (_sneering_)  And if words help thee not, an arrow must?    APOLLO.  'Tis ever my delight to bear this bow.    THANATOS.  And aid this house unjustly? Aye, 'tis so.    APOLLO.  I love this man, and grieve for his dismay.    THANATOS.  And now wilt rob me of my second prey!    APOLLO.  I never robbed thee, neither then nor now.    THANATOS.  Why is Admetus here then, not below?    APOLLO.  He gave for ransom his own wife, for whom ...    THANATOS (_interrupting_).  I am come; and straight will bear her to the tomb.    APOLLO.  Go, take her.--I can never move thine heart.    THANATOS (_mocking_).  To slay the doomed?--Nay; I will do my part.    APOLLO.  No. To keep death for them that linger late.    THANATOS (_still mocking_).  'Twould please thee, so?... I owe thee homage great.    APOLLO.  Ah, then she may yet ... she may yet grow old?    THANATOS (_with a laugh_).  No!... I too have my rights, and them I hold.    APOLLO.  'Tis but one life thou gainest either-wise.    THANATOS.  When young souls die, the richer is my prize.    APOLLO.  Old, with great riches they will bury her.    THANATOS.  Fie on thee, fie! Thou rich-man's lawgiver!    APOLLO.  How? Is there wit in Death, who seemed so blind?    THANATOS.  The rich would buy long life for all their kind.    APOLLO.  Thou will not grant me, then, this boon? 'Tis so?    THANATOS.  Thou knowest me, what I am: I tell thee, no!    APOLLO.  I know gods sicken at thee and men pine.    THANATOS.  Begone! Too many things not meant for thine  Thy greed hath conquered; but not all, not all!    APOLLO.  I swear, for all thy bitter pride, a fall  Awaits thee. One even now comes conquering  Towards this house, sent by a southland king  To fetch him four wild coursers, of the race  Which rend men's bodies in the winds of Thrace.  This house shall give him welcome good, and he  Shall wrest this woman from thy worms and thee.  So thou shalt give me all, and thereby win  But hatred, not the grace that might have been.                                         [_Exit_ APOLLO.]    THANATOS.  Talk on, talk on! Thy threats shall win no bride  From me.--This woman, whatsoe'er betide,  Shall lie in Hades' house. Even at the word  I go to lay upon her hair my sword.  For all whose head this grey sword visiteth  To death are hallowed and the Lords of death.     [THANATOS _goes into the house. Presently, as the day grows lighter,  the_ CHORUS _enters: it consists of Citizens of Pherae, who speak  severally._]      CHORUS.    LEADER.  Quiet, quiet, above, beneath!    SECOND ELDER.  The house of Admetus holds its breath.    THIRD ELDER.  And never a King's friend near,  To tell us either of tears to shed  For Pelias' daughter, crowned and dead;    Or joy, that her eyes are clear.  Bravest, truest of wives is she  That I have seen or the world shall see.    DIVERS CITIZENS, _conversing_.  (The dash -- indicates a new speaker.)    --Hear ye no sob, or noise of hands      Beating the breast? No mourners' cries        For one they cannot save?  --Nothing: and at the door there stands      No handmaid.--Help, O Paian; rise,        O star beyond the wave!    --Dead, and this quiet? No, it cannot be.  --Dead, dead!--Not gone to burial secretly!    --Why? I still fear: what makes your speech so brave?  --Admetus cast that dear wife to the grave        Alone, with none to see?    --I see no bowl of clear spring water.      It ever stands before the dread        Door where a dead man rests.  --No lock of shorn hair! Every daughter      Of woman shears it for the dead.        No sound of bruised breasts!    --Yet 'tis this very day ...--This very day?  --The Queen should pass and lie beneath the clay.  --It hurts my life, my heart!--All honest hearts    Must sorrow for a brightness that departs,        A good life worn away.    LEADER.  To wander o'er leagues of land,    To search over wastes of sea,  Where the Prophets of Lycia stand,    Or where Ammon's daughters three  Make runes in the rainless sand,    For magic to make her free--      Ah, vain! for the end is here;      Sudden it comes and sheer.  What lamb on the altar-strand    Stricken shall comfort me?    SECOND ELDER.  Only, only one, I know:    Apollo's son was he,  Who healed men long ago.    Were he but on earth to see,  She would rise from the dark below    And the gates of eternity.      For men whom the Gods had slain      He pitied and raised again;  Till God's fire laid him low,  And now, what help have we?    OTHERS.  All's done that can be. Every vow  Full paid; and every altar's brow    Full crowned with spice of sacrifice.  No help remains nor respite now.    _Enter from the Castle a_ HANDMAID, _almost in tears._    LEADER.  But see, a handmaid cometh, and the tear  Wet on her cheek! What tiding shall we hear?...    Thy grief is natural, daughter, if some ill  Hath fallen to-day. Say, is she living still  Or dead, your mistress? Speak, if speak you may.    MAID.  Alive. No, dead.... Oh, read it either way.    LEADER.  Nay, daughter, can the same soul live and die?    MAID.  Her life is broken; death is in her eye.    LEADER.  Poor King, to think what she was, and what thou!    MAID.  He never knew her worth.... He will know it now.    LEADER.  There is no hope, methinks, to save her still?    MAID.  The hour is come, and breaks all human will.    LEADER.  She hath such tendance as the dying crave?    MAID.  For sure: and rich robes ready for her grave.    LEADER.  'Fore God, she dies high-hearted, aye, and far  In honour raised above all wives that are!    MAID.  Far above all! How other? What must she,  Who seeketh to surpass this woman, be?  Or how could any wife more shining make  Her lord's love, than by dying for his sake?  But thus much all the city knows. 'Tis here,  In her own rooms, the tale will touch thine ear  With strangeness. When she knew the day was come,  She rose and washed her body, white as foam,  With running water; then the cedarn press  She opened, and took forth her funeral dress  And rich adornment. So she stood arrayed  Before the Hearth-Fire of her home, and prayed:  \"Mother, since I must vanish from the day,  This last, last time I kneel to thee and pray;  Be mother to my two children! Find some dear  Helpmate for him, some gentle lord for her.  And let not them, like me, before their hour  Die; let them live in happiness, in our  Old home, till life be full and age content.\"    To every household altar then she went  And made for each his garland of the green  Boughs of the wind-blown myrtle, and was seen  Praying, without a sob, without a tear.  She knew the dread thing coming, but her clear  Cheek never changed: till suddenly she fled  Back to her own chamber and bridal bed:  Then came the tears and she spoke all her thought.    \"O bed, whereon my laughing girlhood's knot  Was severed by this man, for whom I die,  Farewell! 'Tis thou ... I speak not bitterly....  'Tis thou hast slain me. All alone I go  Lest I be false to him or thee. And lo,  Some woman shall lie here instead of me--  Happier perhaps; more true she cannot be.\"    She kissed the pillow as she knelt, and wet  With flooding tears was that fair coverlet.    At last she had had her fill of weeping; then  She tore herself away, and rose again,  Walking with downcast eyes; yet turned before  She had left the room, and cast her down"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10542"],[0,"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\" (#3)"],[1,"nd, even as we  looked, it became plainer heard, until, in a while, it was all about  us--aye! it seemed to come floating down through the broken framework of  the skylight as though some weariful, unseen thing stood and cried upon  the decks above our heads.    Now through all that crying, none moved; none, that is, save Josh and the  bo'sun, and they went up into the scuttle to see whether anything was in  sight; but they found nothing, and so came down to us; for there was no  wisdom in exposing ourselves, unarmed as we were, save for our  sheath-knives.    And so, in a little, the night crept down upon the world, and still we  sat within the dark cabin, none speaking, and knowing of the rest only by  the glows of their pipes.    All at once there came a low, muttered growl, stealing across the land;  and immediately the crying was quenched in its sullen thunder. It died  away, and there was a full minute of silence; then, once more it came,  and it was nearer and more plain to the ear. I took my pipe from my  mouth; for I had come again upon the great fear and uneasiness which the  happenings of the first night had bred in me, and the taste of the smoke  brought me no more pleasure. The muttered growl swept over our heads and  died away into the distance, and there was a sudden silence.    Then, in that quietness, came the bo'sun's voice. He was bidding us  haste every one into the captain's cabin. As we moved to obey him, he ran  to draw over the lid of the scuttle; and Josh went with him, and,  together, they had it across; though with difficulty. When we had come  into the captain's cabin, we closed and barred the door, piling two great  sea chests up against it; and so we felt near safe; for we knew that no  thing, man nor beast, could come at us there. Yet, as may be supposed, we  felt not altogether secure; for there was that in the growling which now  filled the darkness, that seemed demoniac, and we knew not what horrid  Powers were abroad.    And so through the night the growling continued, seeming to be mighty  near unto us--aye! almost over our heads, and of a loudness far  surpassing all that had come to us on the previous night; so that I  thanked the Almighty that we had come into shelter in the midst of so  much fear.          III    The Thing That Made Search      Now at times, I fell upon sleep, as did most of the others; but, for the  most part, I lay half sleeping and half waking--being unable to attain to  true sleep by reason of the everlasting growling above us in the night,  and the fear which it bred in me. Thus, it chanced that just after  midnight, I caught a sound in the main cabin beyond the door, and  immediately I was fully waked. I sat me up and listened, and so became  aware that something was fumbling about the deck of the main cabin. At  that, I got to my feet and made my way to where the bo'sun lay, meaning  to waken him, if he slept; but he caught me by the ankle, as I stooped to  shake him, and whispered to me to keep silence; for he too had been aware  of that strange noise of something fumbling beyond in the big cabin.    In a little, we crept both of us so close to the door as the chests  would allow, and there we crouched, listening; but could not tell what  manner of thing it might be which produced so strange a noise. For it  was neither shuffling, nor treading of any kind, nor yet was it the  whirr of a bat's wings, the which had first occurred to me, knowing how  vampires are said to inhabit the nights in dismal places. Nor yet was it  the slurr of a snake; but rather it seemed to us to be as though a great  wet cloth were being rubbed everywhere across the floor and bulkheads.  We were the better able to be certain of the truth of this likeness,  when, suddenly, it passed across the further side of the door behind  which we listened: at which, you may be sure, we drew backwards both of  us in fright; though the door, and the chests, stood between us and that  which rubbed against it.    Presently, the sound ceased, and, listen as we might, we could no longer  distinguish it. Yet, until the morning, we dozed no more; being troubled  in mind as to what manner of thing it was which had made search in the  big cabin.    Then in time the day came, and the growling ceased. For a mournful while  the sad crying filled our ears, and then at last the eternal silence that  fills the day hours of that dismal land fell upon us.    So, being at last in quietness, we slept, being greatly awearied. About  seven in the morning, the bo'sun waked me, and I found that they had  opened the door into the big cabin; but though the bo'sun and I made  careful search, we could nowhere come upon anything to tell us aught  concerning the thing which had put us so in fright. Yet, I know not if I  am right in saying that we came upon nothing; for, in several places, the  bulkheads had a _chafed_ look; but whether this had been there before  that night, we had no means of telling.    Of that which we had heard, the bo'sun bade me make no mention, for he  would not have the men put more in fear than need be. This I conceived to  be wisdom, and so held my peace. Yet I was much troubled in my mind to  know what manner of thing it was which we had need to fear, and more--I  desired greatly to know whether we should be free of it in the daylight  hours; for there was always with me, as I went hither and thither, the  thought that IT--for that is how I designated it in my mind--might come  upon us to our destruction.    Now after breakfast, at which we had each a portion of salt pork, besides  rum and biscuit (for by now the fire in the caboose had been set going),  we turned-to at various matters, under the directing of the bo'sun. Josh  and two of the men made examination of the water casks, and the rest of  us lifted the main hatch-covers, to make inspection of her cargo; but lo!  we found nothing, save some three feet of water in her hold.    By this time, Josh had drawn some water off from the casks; but it was  most unsuitable for drinking, being vile of smell and taste. Yet the  bo'sun bade him draw some into buckets, so that the air might haply  purify it; but though this was done, and the water allowed to stand  through the morning, it was but little better.    At this, as might be imagined, we were exercised in our minds as to the  manner in which we should come upon suitable water; for by now we were  beginning to be in need of it. Yet though one said one thing, and another  said another, no one had wit enough to call to mind any method by which  our need should be satisfied. Then, when we had made an end of dining,  the bo'sun sent Josh, with four of the men, up stream, perchance after a  mile or two the water should prove of sufficient freshness to meet our  purpose. Yet they returned a little before sundown having no water; for  everywhere it was salt.    Now the bo'sun, foreseeing that it might be impossible to come upon  water, had set the man whom he had ordained to be our cook, to boiling  the creek water in three great kettles. This he had ordered to be done  soon after the boat left; and over the spout of each, he had hung a  great pot of iron, filled with cold water from the hold--this being  cooler than that from the creek--so that the steam from each kettle  impinged upon the cold surface of the iron pots, and being by this means  condensed, was caught in three buckets placed beneath them upon the floor  of the caboose. In this way, enough water was collected to supply us for  the evening and the following morning; yet it was but a slow method, and  we had sore need of a speedier, were we to leave the hulk so soon as I,  for one, desired.    We made our supper before sunset, so as to be free of the crying which we  had reason to expect. After that, the bo'sun shut the scuttle, and we  went every one of us into the captain's cabin, after which we barred the  door, as on the previous night; and well was it for us that we acted with  this prudence.    By the time that we had come into the captain's cabin, and secured the  door, it was upon sunsetting, and as the dusk came on, so did the  melancholy wailing pass over the land; yet, being by now somewhat inured  to so much strangeness, we lit our pipes, and smoked; though I observed  that none talked; for the crying without was not to be forgotten.    Now, as I have said, we kept silence; but this was only for a time, and  our reason for breaking it was a discovery made by George, the younger  apprentice. This lad, being no smoker, was fain to do something to  while away the time, and with this intent, he had raked out the  contents of a small box, which had lain upon the deck at the side of  the forrard bulkhead.    The box had appeared filled with odd small lumber of which a part was a  dozen or so grey paper wrappers, such as are used, I believe, for  carrying samples of corn; though I have seen them put to other purposes,  as, indeed, was now the case. At first George had tossed these aside; but  it growing darker the bo'sun lit one of the candles which we had found  in the lazarette. Thus, George, who was proceeding to tidy back the  rubbish which was cumbering the place, discovered something which caused  him to cry out to us his astonishment.    Now, upon hearing George call out, the bo'sun bade him keep silence,  thinking it was but a piece of boyish restlessness; but George drew the  candle to him, and bade us to listen; for the wrappers were covered with  fine handwriting after the fashion of a woman's.    Even as George told us of that which he had found we became aware that  the night was upon us; for suddenly the crying ceased, and in place  thereof there came out of the far distance the low thunder of the  night-growling, that had tormented us through the past two nights. For a  space, we ceased to smoke, and sat--listening; for it was a very fearsome  sound. In a very little while it seemed to surround the ship,"]]]
