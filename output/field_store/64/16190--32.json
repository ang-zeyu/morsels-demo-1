The girl, evidently the elder of the two, carries a  slate, school-books, and writing materials under her arm; the boy has a  similar equipment, which he carries in an open gray linen bag slung  across his shoulder. The girl wears a cap of white twill, that reaches  almost to her forehead, and from beneath it the outline of her broad  brow stands forth prominently; the boy's head is bare. Only one child's  step is heard, for while the boy has strong shoes on, the girl is  barefoot. Wherever the path is broad enough, the children walk side by  side, but where the space between the hedges is too narrow for this, the  girl walks ahead.    [Illustration: BERTHOLD AUERBACH Hans Meyer]    The white hoar frost has covered the faded leaves of the bushes, and the  haws and berries; and the flips especially, standing upright on their  bare stems, seem coated with silver. The sparrows in the hedges  twitter and fly away in restless groups at the children's approach; then  they settle down not far off, only to go whirring up again, till at last  they flutter into a garden and alight in an apple-tree with such force  that the leaves come showering down. A magpie flies up suddenly from the  path and shoots across to the large pear-tree, where some ravens are  perched in silence. The magpie must have told them something, for the  ravens fly up and circle round the tree; one old fellow perches himself  on the waving crown, while the others find good posts of observation on  the branches below. They, too, are doubtless curious to know why the  children, with their school things, are following the wrong path and  going out of the village; one raven, indeed, flies out as a scout and  perches on a stunted willow by the pond. The children, however, go  quietly on their way till, by the alders beside the pond, they come upon  the high-road, which they cross to reach a humble house standing on the  farther side. The house is locked up, and the children stand at the door  and knock gently. The girl cries bravely: \"Father! mother!\"--and the boy  timidly repeats it after her: \"Father! mother!\" Then the girl takes hold  of the frost-covered latch and presses it, at first gently, and listens;  the boards of the door creak, but there is no other result. And now she  ventures to rattle the latch up and down vigorously, but the sounds die  away in the empty vestibule--no human voice answers. The boy then  presses his mouth to a crack in the door and cries: \"Father! mother!\" He  looks up inquiringly at his sister--his breath on the door has also  turned to hoar frost.    From the village, lying in a shroud of mist, come the measured sounds of  the thresher's flail, now in sudden volleys, now slowly and with a  dragging cadence, now in sharp, crackling bursts, and now again with a  dull and hollow beat. Sometimes there is the noise of one flail only,  but presently others have joined in on all sides. The children stand  still and seem lost. Finally they stop knocking and calling, and sit  down on some uprooted tree-stumps. The latter lie in a heap around the  trunk of a mountain-ash which stands beside the house, and which is now  radiant with its red berries. The children's eyes are again turned  toward the door-but it is still locked.    \"Father got those out of the Mossbrook Wood,\" said the girl, pointing to  the stumps; and she added with a precocious look: \"They give out lots  of heat, and are worth quite a little; for there is a good deal of resin  in them, and that burns like a torch. But chopping them brings in the  most money.\"    \"If I were already grown up,\" replied the boy, \"I'd take father's big  ax, and the beechwood mallet, and the two iron wedges, and the ash wedge  and break it all up as if it were glass. And then I'd make a fine,  pointed heap of it like the charcoal-burner, Mathew, makes in the woods;  and when father comes home, how pleased he'll be! But you must not tell  him who did it!\" the boy concluded, raising a warning finger at his  sister.    She seemed to have a dawning suspicion that it was useless to wait there  for their father and mother, for she looked up at her brother very  sadly. When her glance fell on his shoes, she said:    \"Then you must have father's boots, too. But come, we will play ducks  and drakes-you shall see that I can throw farther than you!\"    As they walked away, the girl said:    \"I'll give you a riddle to guess: What wood will warm you without your  burning it?\"    \"The schoolmaster's ruler, when you get the spatters,\" answered the boy.    \"No, that's not what I mean: The wood that you chop makes you warm  without your burning it.\" And pausing by the hedge, she asked again:    \"On a stick he has his head, And his jacket it is red, And filled with  stone is he--Now who may he be?\"    The boy bethought himself very gravely, and cried \"Stop! You mustn't  tell me what it is!--Why, its a hip!\"    The girl nodded assentingly, and made a face as if this were the first  time she had ever given him the riddle to guess; as a matter of fact,  however, she had given it to him very often, and had used it many times  to cheer him up.    The sun had dispersed the mist, and the little valley stood in  glittering sheen, as the children turned away to the pond to skim flat  stones on the water. As they passed the house the girl pressed the latch  once more; but again the door did not open, nor was anything to be seen  at the window. And now the children played merrily beside the pond, and  the girl seemed quite content that her brother should be the more clever  at the sport, and that he should boast of it and grow quite excited over  it; indeed, she manifestly tried to be less clever at it, than she  really was, for the stones she threw almost always plumped down to the  bottom as soon as they struck the water--for which she got properly  laughed at by her companion. In the excitement of the sport the children  quite forgot where they were and why they had come there--and yet it was  a strange and sorrowful occasion.    In the house, which was now so tightly locked up, there had lived, but a  short time before, one Josenhans, with his wife and their two children,  Amrei (Anna Marie) and Damie (Damien). The father was a woodcutter in  the forest, and was, moreover, an adept at various kinds of work; the  house, which was in a dilapidated state when he bought it, he had  himself repaired and reroofed, and in the autumn he was going to  whitewash it inside--the lime was already lying prepared in the trench,  covered with withered branches. His wife was one of the best  day-laboring women in the village--ready for anything, day and night, in  weal and in woe; for she had trained her children, especially Amrei, to  manage for themselves at an early age. Industry and frugal contentment  made the house one of the happiest in the village. Then came a deadly  sickness which snatched away the mother, and the following evening, the  father; and a few days later two coffins were carried away from the  little house. The children had been taken immediately into the next  house, to \"Coaly Mathew,\" and they did not know of their parents' death  until they were dressed in their Sunday clothes to follow the bodies.    Josenhans and his wife had no near relations in the place, but there  was, nevertheless, loud weeping heard, and much mournful praise of the  dead couple. The village magistrate walked with one of the children at  each hand behind the two coffins. Even at the grave the children were  quiet and unconscious, indeed, almost cheerful, though they often asked  for their father and mother. They dined at the magistrate's house, and  everybody was exceedingly kind to them; and when they got up from the  table, each one received a parcel of cakes to take away.    But that evening, when, according to an arrangement of the village  authorities, \"Crappy Zachy\" came to get Damie, and Black Marianne called  for Amrei, the children refused to separate from each other, and cried  aloud, and wanted to go home. Damie soon allowed himself to be pacified  by all sorts of promises, but Amrei obliged them to use force--she would  not move from the spot, and the magistrate's foreman had to carry her in  his arms into Black Marianne's house. There she found her own bed--the  one she had used at home--but she would not lie down on it. Finally,  however, exhausted by crying, she fell asleep on the floor and was put  to bed in her clothes. Damie, too, was heard weeping aloud at Crappy  Zachy's, and even screaming pitiably, but soon after he was silent.    The much-defamed Black Marianne, on the other hand, showed on this first  evening how quietly anxious she was about her foster-child. For many,  many years she had not had a child about her, and now she stood before  the sleeping girl and said, almost aloud:    \"Happy sleep of childhood! Happy children who can be crying, and  before you look around they are asleep, without worry or restless  tossing!\"    [Illustration: Benjamin Vautier TWO COFFINS WERE CARRIED AWAY FROM THE  LITTLE HOUSE]    She sighed deeply.    The next morning Amrei went early to her brother to help him dress  himself, and consoled him concerning what had happened to him, declaring  that when their father came home he would pay off Crappy Zachy. Then the  two children went out to their parents' house, knocked at the door and  wept aloud, until Coaly Mathew, who lived near there, came and took them  to school. He asked the master to explain to the children that their  parents were dead, because he himself could not make it clear to  them--Amrei especially seemed determined not to understand it. The  master did all he could, and the children became quiet. But from the  school they went back to the empty house and"]]]
