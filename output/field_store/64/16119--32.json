Volume 12, No. 334, (#3)"],[1,"country like Greece, situated in the loveliest  climate in the world, must of course have some effect on the spirit of  the people, yet the degree of it seems extremely uncertain. The Swiss  seem in a great measure to have lost their renown for patriotism, by  their slavish submissions to foreign yokes during the late war, and by  the apathy with which they allow their rights to be trampled on at this  day by a tyrannical aristocracy at home. There is now a proverb of  \"_Point d'argent, point de Suisse!_\"--a melancholy reflection for a land  where Tell drew his unerring shaft in the cause of freedom--where, so  late as 1798, a patriot of the canton of Schwyz concluded an address with  these words:--\"The dew of the mountain may still moisten its verdure--the  sweets of the valley may still shed their fragrance around you--the  purple grape may still mingle with the green vine--the note of the maiden  may still sound sweetly to the ear of her lover--the soft cry of the  infant charm the feelings of the father--the confiding wife may yet  gladden the home of her husband--but the heart of man will be rotten--the  spirit of your ancestors extinguished--Switzerland no more, if you submit  to the French. If you love your country, and value your honour, be men,  and resist. If not, prove cowards, and obey.\"    Patriotism, however, does not confine itself to mountains, as witness the  history of the ancient and modern republics of Italy; of the resistance  of Holland and Belgium to their oppressors; of the English and French  revolutions. It is unnecessary to look across the Atlantic, to prove the  existence of the pure plant in its most healthy and vigorous growth. The  new world is dedicated to the cause of liberty, and from that good seed  is now springing forth fruit an hundred fold; the progress of  civilization, of knowledge, of virtue, and happiness in the United States,  is, by every recent traveller there, proved to be immense. The example of  her own children is becoming an additional security for right principles  to the mother country; and long may it so continue:      Yes! in that generous cause, for ever strong,    The patriot's virtue and the poet's song,    Still as the tide of ages rolls away,    Shall charm the world, unconscious of decay!      We cannot even contend that the sun has the effect of inflaming the  imaginations of men, and infusing into them either vivacity or a poetic  spirit. The French, Greeks, Egyptians, and Persians are all remarkable  for gaiety; while the Spaniards, Turks, and Chinese, the latitudes of  whose countries vary but little, are noted for a grave and serious  deportment. The land that has given birth to Shakspeare and Milton has no  reason to complain of the want of warmth of imagination. Klopstock and  Goethe,--the latter now allowed to be first of the living poets,--are  instances of the wide range of the spirit of poetry. Shall we, who have  seen Byron writing, as it were, in the midst of us, yield assent to  calling Greece and Italy the countries of imagination, _par excellence_,  because they have produced Homer and Dante? Assuredly not. We cannot even  admit, as a general proposition, that the languages of the south are  always the smoothest and most melodious, and the northern ones harsh, and  not adapted for music. The liquid, smooth, and effeminate language of  modern Italy is totally different from the strong, energetic, and harsh  Latin used by the ancient Romans. The Arabic will be immediately admitted,  by any who has heard a page of it read, to be extremely uncouth and  disagreeable. The Russian, on the contrary, is soft and musical. And to  recur to a more familiar instance, we shall find the Welsh tongue, on  examination, to be in fact very poetic, and peculiarly capable of giving  force and expression--whether of grandeur, of terror, or of melody--to  the idea the words are intended to convey. Let the reader who understands  the Welsh pronunciation, judge whether the following distich is not an  echo to, and as it were a picture of, the sense of the majestic sound of  thunder:--        \"Tan a dwr y'n ymwriaw,      Yw'r taranau dreigiau draw.\"      The roaring thunder, dreadful in its ire,    Is water warring with aerial fire.      The next specimen will show the capability of the Welsh to express soft  and melodious sounds:--        \"Mae mil o leisian meluson,      Mai mel o hyd ym mola hon.\"      The mellifluence of these lines, written on a harp, is totally lost in  the translation:--      Within the concave of its womb is found    The magic scale of soul-enchanting sound.      The best illustration of the comparative degree of mental excellence  between the southern and northern nations, is, perhaps, that of Bishop  Berkeley, who compares the southern wits to cucumbers, which are commonly  all good of their kind, but at best an insipid fruit; while the northern  geniuses are like melons, of which not one in fifty is good; but when it  is so, it has an excellent relish. Now it is not probable that the same  climate which is favourable to the study of the sciences and to the  reasoning powers, would prevent their being pushed to the utmost extent;  and the solution of this difference may, perhaps, depend on the question,  whether a general diffusion of learning among a people is a state of  things usually accompanied by a remarkable perfection in particular  persons. A man of ordinary acquirements in the present day might have  passed for a prodigy in the thirteenth century; and the novelty and  distinction attaching to one who rises above the rest, is, of course,  more difficult to attain in an age where knowledge is possessed  universally. Inasmuch, therefore, as the liberal arts have been imported  to us from the south, and their progress is as yet not so extensive in  cold countries, the stimulus to their cultivation in the latter is so  much the greater; which is one way of accounting for the giants in  science that have appeared in the north, It is moreover remarkable, that  the northern nations have a stronger apprehension of abstract  propositions, and a greater fondness for generalizing, than seems to be  the case in the south. The difference between a Frenchman and a German is  observable in this particular, by any one who attends to their manner of  telling stories. The former, in giving you an account of his being robbed  by a servant to whom he had been particularly kind, first tells you the  facts, and concludes with a reflection, \"_Voila que le monde est ingrat!_\"  The German, on the other hand, in order to prove to you the general  proposition of the unthankfulness of men to their benefactors, gives you  the instance that has recently happened. To the one, the fact is  interesting, because it proves the proposition; to the other, the  proposition is a conclusion, which he hastily draws from an individual  occurrence that has suggested it.    The climate does not appear to affect even the bodies of men to any  great degree. We cannot pronounce that it is the sun which makes  the African black, when we see the same heat pouring down on the  copper-coloured American, in the same degree of latitude, though in  another longitude. The inhabitants of Terra del Fuego are of a very dark  hue, approaching to black; and yet that island experiences as severe  cold as any part of the earth, as Sir Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander  have testified. The complexion and appearance of the Jews, and other  emigratory races, is the same in all parts of the world. And a stronger  proof cannot be given, than the marked distinction which still exists  among the three great families that divide Europe. These three have been  for the last 2,500 years, and still are, the Celts, the Teutonic race,  and the Slavonic race.    The Celts have black hair and eyes, and a white skin, verging to brown.  They chiefly inhabit the west of Europe, viz. the south of France,  (called by M. Dupin, _France obscure_,) Spain, Portugal, and the  greatest part of Italy. To them also belong the ancient Britons, the  Welsh, Bretons, Irish, Highland Scotch, and the Manks, or people of the  Isle of Man. The great German race, with blue eyes, yellow or reddish  hair, and a fair and red skin, occupies the middle of Europe. It  includes the Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, Danes, ancient and modern  Germans, Saxons and English, Caledonians and Lowland Scotch, the  Belgians, the Vandals, and the Goths.    The east of Europe contains the Sarmatian and Slavonic tribes, with  dark hair and eyes, darker skin than the Germans, and larger limbs than  the Celts. This race includes the Russians, Poles, Croats, Slavons,  Bohemians, Bulgarians, Cossacks, and other tribes using the Slavonic  language.    We trust we shall not give offence to such of our readers as wear the  Celtic appearance, if we assume, as undisputed, the general superiority  of the Teutonic to the Celtic or Slavonic races in mental acquirements.  We believe that the German race are pre-eminent for their sense of order,  of law, and of social institutions; and whether they derive these  advantages from the east, whence their origin has now been satisfactorily  traced, or however they have attained them, we have only to reflect on  the civilization introduced by the Saxons into England--on the actual  state of the ancient Britons at present inhabiting Wales and the  Highlands--and on the terrible disorder and barbarism that reigns in  Ireland--to be thankful that the pure Celtic blood has not been allowed  to remain unmixed in these islands.    What, then, it will be asked, is the result of these speculations? Are we  to conclude that the races of men are essentially different, or that the  variations are attributable to the various degrees of moral cultivation  that each nation has received? And our answer is, that we are inclined to  believe the capacities for improvement of races, as of individuals, to  have been differently"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11282"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 336, (#3)"],[1,"ressions, and \"_vivoit de grand  sensations_,\" (which we cannot translate), capable of the most noble  devotedness, and, persuaded that excellence is comprised in justice, he  embraced the cause of the Greeks. Still young, Byron had traversed Greece,  _properly so called_, and described the moral picture of its inhabitants.  He quitted these countries, pitying in his verses the misery of the  Greeks, blaming their lethargy, and despising their stupid submission; so  difficult is it to know a nation by a rapid glance. What was the  astonishment of the poet, when some years later he saw these people, whom  he had thought unworthy to bear the name of Greeks, rise up with  simultaneous eagerness, and declare, in the face of the world, that \"they  _would_ again become a nation.\" Byron hesitated at first; ancient  prepossessions made him attribute this rupture to a partial convulsion,  the ultimate effort of a being ready to breathe the last sigh. Soon new  prodigies, brilliant exploits, and heroic constancy, which sustained  itself in spite of every opposition, proved to him that he had ill-judged  this people, and excited him to repair his error by the sacrifice of his  fortune and life; he wished to concur in the work of regeneration. From  the shores of the beautiful Etruria he set sail for Greece, in the month  of August, 1823. He visited at first the seven Ionian Isles, where he  sojourned some time, busied in concluding the first Greek loan. The death  of Marco Botzaris redoubled the enthusiasm of Byron, and perhaps  determined him to prefer the town of Missolonghi, which already showed  for its glory the tombs of Normann, Kyriakoulis, and Botzaris. Alas! that  town was destined, four months later, to reckon another mausoleum!    Towards the month of November a Hydriote brig of war, commanded by the  nephew of the brave Criezy, sailed to Cephalonia to take him on board,  and bring him to Missolonghi; but the Septinsular government, not  permitting ships bearing a Greek flag to come into its harbours, Byron  was obliged to pass to Zante in a small vessel, and to join the Greek  brig afterwards, which was waiting for him near Zante. Hardly was Byron  on board when he kissed the mainmast, calling it \"_sacred wood_.\" The  ship's crew astonished at this whimsical behaviour, regarded him in  silence; suddenly Byron turned towards the captain and the sailors, whom  he embraced with tears, and said to them, \"It is by this wood that you  will consolidate your independence.\" At these words the sailors, moved  with enthusiasm, regarded him with admiration. Byron soon reached  Missolonghi: the members of the Administrative Council received him at  the head of two thousand soldiers drawn up in order. The artillery of the  place, and the discharge of musquetry announced the happy arrival of this  great man. All the inhabitants ran to the shore, and welcomed him with  acclamations. As soon as he had entered the town, he went to the hotel of  the Administrative Council, where he was complimented by Porphyrios,  Archbishop of Arta, Lepanto and Etolia, accompanied by all his clergy.  The first words of Byron were, \"Where is the brother of the modern  Leonidas?\" Constantine Botzaris, a young man, tall and well made,  immediately stepped forward, and Byron thus accosted him:--\"Happy mortal!  Thou art the brother of a hero, whose name will never be effaced in the  lapse of ages!\" Then perceiving a great crowd assembled under the windows  of the hotel, he advanced towards the casement, and said, \"Hellenes! you  see amongst you an Englishman who has never ceased to study Greece in her  antiquity, and to think of her in her modern state; an Englishman who has  always invoked by his vows that liberty, for which you are now making so  many heroic efforts. I am grateful for the sentiments which you testify  towards me; in a short time you will see me in the middle of your  phalanxes, to conquer or perish with you.\" A month afterwards the  government sent him a deputation, charged to offer him a sword and the  patent of Greek citizenship; at the same time the town of Missolonghi  inscribed him in its archives. For this public act they prepared a solemn  ceremony for him; they fixed beforehand the day--they invited there by  circular letters the inhabitants of the neighbouring districts--and more  than twenty thousand persons arrived at Missolonghi. Byron in a Greek  costume, preceded and followed by all the military, who loved him,  proceeded to the church, where the Archbishop Porphyrios and the bishop  of Rogon, Joseph, that martyr of religion and his country, received him  in the vestibule of the church, clothed in their sacerdotal habits; and,  after having celebrated mass, they offered him the sword and the patent  of citizenship. Byron demanded that the sword should be first dedicated  on the tomb of Marco Botzaris; and immediately the whole retinue, and an  immense crowd, went out of the church to the tomb of that warrior, which  had been ornamented with beautiful marble at the expense of the poet.    The archbishop placed the sword upon this tomb, and then Byron, to  inspire the Greeks with enthusiasm, advanced with a religious silence,  and stopping all on a sudden, he pronounced this discourse in the Greek  tongue:--\"What man reposes buried under this stone? What hollow voice  issues from this tomb? What is this sepulchre, from whence will spring  the happiness of Greece? But what am I saying? Is it not the tomb of  Marco Botzaris, who has been dead some months, and who, with a handful of  brave men, precipitated himself upon the numerous ranks of the most  formidable enemies of Greece? How dare I approach the sacred place where  he reposes--I, who neither possess his heroism nor his virtues? However,  in touching this tomb, I hope that its emanations will always inflame my  heart with patriotism.\" So saying, and advancing towards the sepulchre,  he kissed it while shedding tears. Every spectator exclaimed, \"Lord Byron  for ever!\" \"I see,\" added his lordship, \"the sword and the letter of  citizenship, which the government offers me; from this day I am the  fellow-citizen of this hero, and of all the brave people who surround me.  Hellenes! I hope to live with you, to fight the enemy with you, and to  die with you if it be necessary.\" Byron, superior to vulgar prejudice,  saw in the manners of the _pallikares_ an ingenuous simplicity, a manly  frankness and rustic procedure, but full of honour; he observed in the  people a docility and constancy capable of the greatest efforts, when it  shall be conducted by skilful and virtuous men; he observed amongst the  Greek women natural gaiety, unstudied gentleness, and religious  resignation to misfortunes.    Byron did not pretend to bend a whole people to his tastes and European  habits. He came not to censure with a stern look their costumes, their  dances, and their music; on the contrary, he entered into their national  dances, he learned their warlike songs, he dressed himself like them, he  spoke their language; in a word, he soon became a true _Roumeliote_.  Consequently, he was adored by all Western Greece; every captain  acknowledged him with pleasure as his chief; the proud Souliots gloried  in being under his immediate command. The funds of the first loan being  addressed to him, and submitted to his inspection, gave him influence,  not only over continental Greece, but even over the Peloponnesus; so that  he was in a situation, if not sufficient to stifle discord, at least to  keep it within bounds. Not having yet fathomed the character of all the  chief people, as well civil as military, he was sometimes deceived in the  beginning of his sojourn, which a little hurt his popularity; but being  completely above trifling passions, being able to strengthen by his union  with it the party which appeared to him the most patriotic, he might  without any doubt, with time and experience, have played a part the most  magnificent and salutary to Greece. At first he had constructed, at his  own expense, a fort in the little isle of Xeclamisma, the capture of  which would have given great facilities to the enemies to attack by sea  Missolonghi or Anatoliko. Missolonghi gave to this important fort the  name of \"Fort Byron.\" This nobleman conceived afterwards, studied and  prepared an expedition against the strong place of Lepanto, the capture  of which would have produced consequences singularly favourable. Once in  possession of the means of regularly paying the soldiers, he would have  been able to form a choice body, and take the town, which did not present  any difficulty of attack, either on account of the few troops shut up  there, or the weakness of its fortifications. Byron only waited the  arrival of the loan, to begin his march.    Thus he led an agreeable life in the midst of a nation which he aimed at  saving. Enchanted with the bravery of the Souliots, and their manners,  which recalled to him the simplicity of Homeric times, he assisted at  their banquets, extended upon the turf; he learnt their pyrrhic dance,  and he sang in unison the airs of Riga, harmonizing his steps to the  sound of their national mandolin. Alas! he carried too far his benevolent  condescension. Towards the beginning of April he went to hunt in the  marshes of Missolonghi. He entered on foot in the shallows; he came out  quite wet, and, following the example of the _pallikares_ accustomed to  the _malaria_, he would not change his clothes, and persisted in having  them dried upon his body. Attacked with an inflammation upon the lungs,  he refused to let himself be bled, notwithstanding the intreaties of his  physician, of Maurocordato and all his friends. His malady quickly grew  worse; on the fourth day Byron became delirious; by means of bleeding he  recovered from his drowsiness, but without being able to speak; then,  feeling his end approaching, he gave his attendants to understand that he"]]]
