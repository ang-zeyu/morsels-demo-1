Volume 10, No. 268, August (#3)"],[1,"with the name of Black Beard, whom  traditionary history represents as a pirate, who acquired immense wealth  in his predatory voyages, and was accustomed to bury his treasures in  the banks of creeks and rivers. For a period as low down as the American  revolution, it was common for the ignorant and credulous to dig along  these banks in search of hidden treasures; and impostors found an ample  basis in these current rumours for schemes of delusion. Black Beard,  though tradition says a great deal more of him than is true, was yet a  real person, who acquired no small fame by his maritime exploits during  the first part of the eighteenth century. Among many authentic and  recorded particulars concerning him, the following account of his death  may gratify curiosity:--    From the nature of Black Beard's position in a sloop of little draught  of water, on a coast abounding with creeks, and remarkable for the  number and intricacy of its shoals, with which he had made himself  intimately acquainted, it was deemed impossible to approach him in  vessels of any force. Two hired sloops were therefore manned from the  Pearl and Lime frigates, in the Chesapeake, and put under the command of  Lieutenant Maynard, with instructions to hunt down and destroy this  pirate wherever he should be found. On the 17th of November, in the year  1718, this force sailed from James River, and in the evening of the 21st  came to an inlet in North Carolina, where Black Beard was discovered at  a distance, lying in wait for his prey. The sudden appearance of an  enemy, preparing to attack him, occasioned some surprise; but his sloop  mounting several guns, and being manned with twenty-five of his  desperate followers, he determined to make a resolute defence; and,  having prepared his vessel over night for action, sat down to his  bottle, stimulating his spirits to that pitch of frenzy by which only he  could rescue himself in a contest for his life. The navigation of the  inlet was so difficult, that Maynard's sloops were repeatedly grounded  in their approach, and the pirate, with his experience of the soundings,  possessed considerable advantage in manoeuvring, which enabled him for  some time to maintain a running fight. His vessel, however, in her turn,  having at length grounded, and the close engagement becoming now  inevitable, he reserved her guns to pour in a destructive fire on the  sloops as they advanced to board him. This he so successfully executed,  that twenty-nine men of Maynard's small number were either killed or  wounded by the first broadside, and one of the sloops for a time  disabled. But notwithstanding this severe loss, the lieutenant  persevered in his resolution to grapple with his enemy, or perish in the  attempt. Observing that his own sloop, which was still fit for action,  drew more water than the pirate's, he ordered all her ballast to be  thrown out, and, directing his men to conceal themselves between decks,  took the helm in person, and steered directly aboard of his antagonist,  who continued inextricably fixed on the shoal. This desperate wretch,  previously aware of his danger, and determined never to expiate his  crimes in the hands of justice, had posted one of his banditti, with a  lighted match, over his powder-magazine, to blow up his vessel in the  last extremity. Luckily in this design he was disappointed by his own  ardour and want of circumspection; for, as Maynard approached, having  begun the encounter at close quarters, by throwing upon his antagonist a  number of hand-grenadoes of his own composition, which produced only a  thick smoke, and conceiving that, from their destructive agency, the  sloop's deck had, been completely cleared, he leaped over her bows,  followed by twelve of his men, and advanced upon the lieutenant, who was  the only person then in view; but the men instantly springing up to the  relief of their commander, who was now furiously beset, and in imminent  danger of his life, a violent contest ensued. Black Beard, after seeing  the greater part of his men destroyed at his side, and receiving himself  repeated wounds, at length, stepping back to cock, a pistol, fainted  with the loss of blood, and expired on the spot. Maynard completed his  victory, by securing the remainder of these desperate wretches, who were  compelled to sue for mercy, and a short respite from a less honourable  death at the hands of the executioner.      ISLANDS PRODUCED BY INSECTS.      The whole group of the _Thousand Islands_, and indeed the greater part  of all those whose surfaces are flat, in the neighbourhood of the  equator, owe their origin to the labours of that order of marine worms  which Linnaeus has arranged under the name of _Zoophyta_. These little  animals, in a most surprising manner, construct their calcareous  habitations, under an infinite variety of forms, yet with that order and  regularity, each after its own manner, which to the minute inquirer, is  so discernable in every part of the creation. But, although the eye may  be convinced of the fact, it is difficult for the human mind to conceive  the possibility of insects so small being endued with the power, much  less of being furnished in their own bodies with the materials of  constructing the immense fabrics which, in almost every part of the  Eastern and Pacific Oceans lying between the tropics, are met with in  the shape of detached rocks, or reefs of great extent, just even with  the surface, or islands already clothed with plants, whose bases are  fixed at the bottom of the sea, several hundred feet in depth, where  light and heat, so very essential to animal life, if not excluded, are  sparingly received and feebly felt. Thousands of such rocks, and reefs,  and islands, are known to exist in the eastern ocean, within, and even  beyond, the limits of the tropics. The eastern coast of New Holland is  almost wholly girt with reefs and islands of coral rock, rising  perpendicularly from the bottom of the abyss. Captain Kent, of the  Buffalo, speaking of a coral reef of many miles in extent, on the  south-west coast of New Caledonia, observes, that \"it is level with the  water's edge, and towards the sea, as steep to as a wall of a house;  that he sounded frequently within twice the ship's length of it with a  line of one hundred and fifty fathoms, or nine hundred feet, without  being able to reach the bottom.\" How wonderful, how inconceivable, that  such stupendous fabrics should rise into existence from the silent but  incessant, and almost imperceptible, labours of such insignificant  worms!    To buy books, as some do who make no use of them, only because they were  published by an eminent printer, is much as if a man should buy clothes  that did not fit him, only because they were made by some famous  tailor.--_Pope_.           *       *       *       *       *      TO MY BROTHER, ON HIS LEAVING ENGLAND.

But home after all things--that dear little spot,      Tho' it be but a desert can ne'er be forgot.

The youngsters turned and  flew down the stairs at break-neck speed, and hardly had they started  when the door of the \"Main-top\" was flung open, and its two occupants  rushed down after them.  As though to ensure the retreat being nothing  less than a regular rout, Mugford, who was leading, missed his footing  on the last step, causing every one to fall over him in turn, until all  five boys were sprawling together in a mixed heap upon the floor.    Freeing themselves with some little difficulty from the general  entanglement, they rose to their feet, and after surveying each other  for a moment in silence, gave vent to a simultaneous ejaculation of  \"_The ghost_!\"    \"What were you fellows doing up there?\" asked Kennedy.    \"Why, we came up to have a joke with you,\" answered Vance; \"but just  when we got up to the landing, it--it made that noise!\"    There was the sound of the key turning in the lock of Mr. Blake's door.    \"_Cave_!\" whispered Mugford.    \"Tell him about it,\" added Vance; and giving Diggory a push, they all  three darted into their room just as the master emerged from his,  arrayed in dressing-gown and slippers.    \"Now, then,\" exclaimed the latter, holding his candle above his head,  and peering down the passage, \"what's the meaning of this disturbance?  I thought the whole house was falling down.--Come here, you two, and  explain yourselves!\"    \"Please, sir,\" answered Kennedy and Jacobs in one breath, \"it's the  ghost!\"    \"The ghost!  What ghost?  What d'you mean?\"    The two \"Main-top\" men began a hasty account of the cause of their  sudden fright, taking care, however, to make no mention of the three  hostile visitors who had shared in the surprise.    Mr. Blake listened to their story in silence, then all at once he burst  out laughing, and without a word turned on his heel and went quickly  upstairs.  He entered the attic, and in about half a minute they heard  him coming back.    \"Ha, ha!  I've got your ghost; I've been trying to lay him for some time  past.\"    The jingle of a chain was distinctly audible; Mr. Blake was evidently  bringing the spectre down in his arms!  Diggory and Vance could no  longer restrain their curiosity; they hopped out of bed and glanced  round the corner of the door.  The master held in his hand a rusty old  gin, the iron jaws of which were tightly closed upon the body of an  enormous rat.    \"There's a monster for you!\" he said; \"I think it's the biggest I ever  saw.  He'd carried the trap, chain and all, right across the room, but  that finished him; he was as dead as a stone when I picked him up.  Now get back to bed; I should think you're both nearly frozen.\"    Diggory and Jack Vance followed the advice given to Kennedy and Jacobs,  and did so rather sheepishly.  They felt they had been making tools of  themselves; yet it would never have done to own to such a thing.    \"What a lark!\" said the new boy, after a few moments' silence.    \"Wasn't it!\" returned Jack Vance; \"it's the best joke I've had for a  long time.  But we didn't pay those fellows out for throwing those  snowballs; we must do it some other night.  And now we three must swear  to be friends, and stand by each other against all the world, and  whatever happens.  What shall we call our room?\"    \"I know,\" answered Diggory: \"we'll call it 'The Triple Alliance!'\"        CHAPTER II.      THE PHILISTINES.    The Triple Alliance, the formation of which has just been described, was  destined to be no mere form of speech or empty display of friendship.  The members had solemnly sworn to stand by one another whatever  happened, and the manner in which they carried out their resolve, and  the important consequences which resulted from their concerted actions,  will be made known to the reader as our story progresses.    Poor Mugford certainly seemed likely to be a heavy drag on the  association; he was constantly tumbling into trouble, and needing to be  pulled out again by those who had promised to be his friends.    An instance of this occurred on the day following Diggory's arrival at  The Birches.  He and Vance had gone down after morning school into what  was called the playroom, to partake of two more of the latter's  mince-pies, and on their return to the schoolroom found a crowd  assembled round Acton, who, seated on the top of a small cupboard which  always served as a judicial bench, was hearing a case in which Mugford  was the defendant, while Jacobs and another boy named Cross appeared as  plaintiffs.    The charge was that the former was indebted to the latter for the sum of  half a crown, which he had borrowed towards the end of the previous  term, in separate amounts of one shilling and eighteen pence, promising  to repay them, with interest, immediately after the holidays.  The money  had been expended in the purchase of a disreputable old canary bird, for  which Noaks, the manservant, had agreed to find board and lodging during  the Christmas vacation.  Now, when the creditors reminded Mugford of his  obligations, they found him totally unable to meet their demands for  payment.    \"Now, look here,\" said Acton, addressing the defendant with great  severity, \"no humbug--how much money did you bring back with you?\"    \"Well, I had to pay my brother before I came away for my share in a  telescope we bought last summer, and then--\"    \"Bother your brother and the telescope!  Why can't you answer my  question? How much money did you bring back with you?\"    \"Only five bob.\"    \"Then why in the name of Fortune don't you pay up?\"    \"Because I had to pay all that to Noaks for bird-seed.\"    \"D'you mean to say that that bird ate five shillings' worth of seed in  four weeks?\"    \"Well, so Noaks says; he told me he'd kept scores of birds in his time,  but he'd 'never seen one so hearty at its grub before.'  Those were the  very words he used, and he said it was eating nearly all the day, and  that's one reason why it looks such a dowdy colour, and never sings.\"    \"Well, all I can say is, if you believe all Noaks tells you, you're a  fool.  But that's no reason why these two chaps should be done out of  their money; so now, how are you going to pay them?\"    \"If they only wait till pocket-money's given out--\" began Mugford.    \"Oh no, we shan't!\" interrupted Cross.  \"He only gets sixpence a week,  and he's always breaking windows and other things, and having it  stopped.\"    There seemed only one way out of the difficulty, and that was to put as  it were an execution into Mugford's desk, and realize a certain amount  of his private property.    \"Look here,\" said Acton, \"he must sell something.--Now, then,\" he added,  turning to the defendant, \"just shell out something and bring it here at  once, and we'll have an auction.\"    The boy walked off to his desk, and after rummaging about in it for some  little time, returned with a miscellaneous collection of small articles  in his arms, which he proceeded to hand up one by one for the judge's  inspection.    \"What's this?\"    \"Oh, its a book that was given me on my birthday, called 'Lofty Thoughts  for Little Thinkers.'\"    \"Lofty grandmother!\" said Acton impatiently.    \"What else have you got ?\"    \"Well, here's a wire puzzle, only I think a bit of it's lost, and the  clasp of a cricket belt, and old Dick Rodman's chessboard and some of  the men, and some stuff for chilblains, and--\"    \"Oh, dry up!\" interrupted Acton; \"what bosh!  Who d'you expect would buy  any of that rubbish?  Look here, we'll give you till after dinner, and  unless you find something sensible by then, we shall come and hunt for  ourselves.\"    \"That's just like Mug,\" said Jack Vance to Diggory, as the group of boys  slowly dispersed; \"he's always doing something stupid.  But I suppose as  we made that alliance, we ought to try to help the beggar somehow.\"    They followed their unfortunate comrade to his desk, which when opened  displayed a perfect chaos of ragged books, loose sheets of paper, broken  pen-holders, pieces of string, battered cardboard boxes, and other  rubbish.    \"Look here, Mug, what have you got to sell? you'll have to fork out  something.\"    \"I don't know,\" returned the other mournfully, stirring up the contents  of the desk as though he were making a Christmas pudding.  \"I've got  nothing, except--well, there's this book of Poe's, 'Tales of Adventure,  Mystery, and Imagination,' and my clasp-knife; and perhaps some one  would buy these fret-saw patterns or this dog-chain.\"    He turned out two or three more small articles and laid them on the  form.    \"Are there any of these things you particularly wish to keep?\" asked  Diggory; \"because, if so, Vance and I'll bid for them, and then you can  buy them back from us again when you've got some more money.\"    \"That's awfully kind of you,\" answered Mugford, brightening up.  \"I'll  tell you what I should like to keep, and that's my clasp-knife and the  book; they're such jolly stories.  'The Pit and the Pendulum' always  gives me bad dreams, and 'The Premature Burial' makes you feel certain  you'll be buried alive.\"    \"All right; and did you bring a cake back with you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, then, sell that first, and you can share our grub.\"    The auction was held directly after dinner.  The cake fetched a  shilling, and Diggory and Vance bid ninepence each for the book and  pocket-knife; so Mugford came out of his difficulty without suffering  any further loss than what was afterwards made good again by the  generosity of his two comrades.  They, for their part, made no fuss over  this little act of kindness, but handed the book and clasp-knife over  to Mugford without waiting for the money, and little thinking what an  important part these trifling possessions would play in the subsequent  history of the Triple Alliance.    The sale had not long been concluded, and the little community were  preparing to obey Acton's order to \"Come"]]]
