Occasionally he caught  a glimpse of low hills in the distance. He had hunted often in that  section, and knew where to find grass and water. When he reached  this higher ground he did not, however, halt at the first favorable  camping-spot, but went on and on. Once he came out upon the brow of a  hill and saw a considerable stretch of country beneath him. It had the  gray sameness characterizing all that he had traversed. He seemed to  want to see wide spaces--to get a glimpse of the great wilderness lying  somewhere beyond to the southwest. It was sunset when he decided to camp  at a likely spot he came across. He led the horse to water, and then  began searching through the shallow valley for a suitable place to camp.  He passed by old camp-sites that he well remembered. These, however, did  not strike his fancy this time, and the significance of the change in  him did not occur at the moment. At last he found a secluded spot, under  cover of thick mesquites and oaks, at a goodly distance from the old  trail. He took saddle and pack off the horse. He looked among his  effects for a hobble, and, finding that his uncle had failed to put one  in, he suddenly remembered that he seldom used a hobble, and never on  this horse. He cut a few feet off the end of his lasso and used that.  The horse, unused to such hampering of his free movements, had to be  driven out upon the grass.    Duane made a small fire, prepared and ate his supper. This done, ending  the work of that day, he sat down and filled his pipe. Twilight had  waned into dusk. A few wan stars had just begun to show and brighten.  Above the low continuous hum of insects sounded the evening carol of  robins. Presently the birds ceased their singing, and then the quiet  was more noticeable. When night set in and the place seemed all the more  isolated and lonely for that Duane had a sense of relief.    It dawned upon him all at once that he was nervous, watchful, sleepless.  The fact caused him surprise, and he began to think back, to take note  of his late actions and their motives. The change one day had wrought  amazed him. He who had always been free, easy, happy, especially when  out alone in the open, had become in a few short hours bound, serious,  preoccupied. The silence that had once been sweet now meant nothing  to him except a medium whereby he might the better hear the sounds  of pursuit. The loneliness, the night, the wild, that had always been  beautiful to him, now only conveyed a sense of safety for the present.  He watched, he listened, he thought. He felt tired, yet had no  inclination to rest. He intended to be off by dawn, heading toward the  southwest. Had he a destination? It was vague as his knowledge of that  great waste of mesquite and rock bordering the Rio Grande. Somewhere out  there was a refuge. For he was a fugitive from justice, an outlaw.    This being an outlaw then meant eternal vigilance. No home, no rest, no  sleep, no content, no life worth the living! He must be a lone wolf  or he must herd among men obnoxious to him. If he worked for an honest  living he still must hide his identity and take risks of detection. If  he did not work on some distant outlying ranch, how was he to live? The  idea of stealing was repugnant to him. The future seemed gray and somber  enough. And he was twenty-three years old.    Why had this hard life been imposed upon him?    The bitter question seemed to start a strange iciness that stole  along his veins. What was wrong with him? He stirred the few sticks of  mesquite into a last flickering blaze. He was cold, and for some reason  he wanted some light. The black circle of darkness weighed down upon  him, closed in around him. Suddenly he sat bolt upright and then froze  in that position. He had heard a step. It was behind him--no--on the  side. Some one was there. He forced his hand down to his gun, and the  touch of cold steel was another icy shock. Then he waited. But all  was silent--silent as only a wilderness arroyo can be, with its low  murmuring of wind in the mesquite. Had he heard a step? He began to  breathe again.    But what was the matter with the light of his camp-fire? It had taken  on a strange green luster and seemed to be waving off into the outer  shadows. Duane heard no step, saw no movement; nevertheless, there was  another present at that camp-fire vigil. Duane saw him. He lay there in  the middle of the green brightness, prostrate, motionless, dying. Cal  Bain! His features were wonderfully distinct, clearer than any cameo,  more sharply outlined than those of any picture. It was a hard face  softening at the threshold of eternity. The red tan of sun, the coarse  signs of drunkenness, the ferocity and hate so characteristic of Bain  were no longer there. This face represented a different Bain, showed all  that was human in him fading, fading as swiftly as it blanched white.  The lips wanted to speak, but had not the power. The eyes held an agony  of thought. They revealed what might have been possible for this man  if he lived--that he saw his mistake too late. Then they rolled, set  blankly, and closed in death.    That haunting visitation left Duane sitting there in a cold sweat, a  remorse gnawing at his vitals, realizing the curse that was on him.  He divined that never would he be able to keep off that phantom. He  remembered how his father had been eternally pursued by the furies of  accusing guilt, how he had never been able to forget in work or in sleep  those men he had killed.    The hour was late when Duane's mind let him sleep, and then dreams  troubled him. In the morning he bestirred himself so early that in the  gray gloom he had difficulty in finding his horse. Day had just broken  when he struck the old trail again.    He rode hard all morning and halted in a shady spot to rest and graze  his horse. In the afternoon he took to the trail at an easy trot. The  country grew wilder. Bald, rugged mountains broke the level of the  monotonous horizon. About three in the afternoon he came to a little  river which marked the boundary line of his hunting territory.    The decision he made to travel up-stream for a while was owing to two  facts: the river was high with quicksand bars on each side, and he felt  reluctant to cross into that region where his presence alone meant that  he was a marked man. The bottom-lands through which the river wound to  the southwest were more inviting than the barrens he had traversed. The  rest or that day he rode leisurely up-stream. At sunset he penetrated  the brakes of willow and cottonwood to spend the night. It seemed to  him that in this lonely cover he would feel easy and content. But he  did not. Every feeling, every imagining he had experienced the previous  night returned somewhat more vividly and accentuated by newer ones of  the same intensity and color.    In this kind of travel and camping he spent three more days, during  which he crossed a number of trails, and one road where cattle--stolen  cattle, probably--had recently passed. Thus time exhausted his supply  of food, except salt, pepper, coffee, and sugar, of which he had a  quantity. There were deer in the brakes; but, as he could not get close  enough to kill them with a revolver, he had to satisfy himself with a  rabbit. He knew he might as well content himself with the hard fare that  assuredly would be his lot.    Somewhere up this river there was a village called Huntsville. It  was distant about a hundred miles from Wellston, and had a reputation  throughout southwestern Texas. He had never been there. The fact was  this reputation was such that honest travelers gave the town a wide  berth. Duane had considerable money for him in his possession, and he  concluded to visit Huntsville, if he could find it, and buy a stock of  provisions.    The following day, toward evening, he happened upon a road which  he believed might lead to the village. There were a good many fresh  horse-tracks in the sand, and these made him thoughtful. Nevertheless,  he followed the road, proceeding cautiously. He had not gone very far  when the sound of rapid hoof-beats caught his ears. They came from his  rear. In the darkening twilight he could not see any great distance back  along the road. Voices, however, warned him that these riders, whoever  they were, had approached closer than he liked. To go farther down the  road was not to be thought of, so he turned a little way in among the  mesquites and halted, hoping to escape being seen or heard. As he was  now a fugitive, it seemed every man was his enemy and pursuer.    The horsemen were fast approaching. Presently they were abreast of  Duane's position, so near that he could hear the creak of saddles, the  clink of spurs.    \"Shore he crossed the river below,\" said one man.    \"I reckon you're right, Bill. He's slipped us,\" replied another.    Rangers or a posse of ranchers in pursuit of a fugitive! The knowledge  gave Duane a strange thrill. Certainly they could not have been hunting  him. But the feeling their proximity gave him was identical to what  it would have been had he been this particular hunted man. He held  his breath; he clenched his teeth; he pressed a quieting hand upon his  horse. Suddenly he became aware that these horsemen had halted. They  were whispering. He could just make out a dark group closely massed.  What had made them halt so suspiciously?    \"You're wrong, Bill,\" said a man, in a low but distinct voice.    \"The idee of hearin' a hoss heave. You're wuss'n a ranger. And you're  hell-bent on killin' that rustler. Now I say let's go home and eat.\"    \"Wal, I'll just take a look at the sand,\" replied the man called Bill.    Duane heard the clink of spurs on steel stirrup and the thud of boots on  the ground. There followed a short silence which was broken by a sharply  breathed exclamation."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10317"],[0,"Betty Gordon at Boarding School; Or, The Treasure of Indian Chasm (#3)"],[1,". \"Anybody sick?\"    \"Oh, Bob, such fun!\" Betty's eyes danced with pleasure. \"What do you  think! Norma and Alice Guerin are going to Shadyside!\"    \"Well, I'm willing to jump with joy, but could you tell me what  Shadyside is, and where?\" said Bob humbly. \"Why do the Guerin girls want  to go there?\"    \"I forgot you didn't know,\" apologized Betty. \"Shadyside is the boarding  school, Bob. That's the name of the station, too. It's five hours' ride  from Washington. Let's see, there's Bobby and Louise Littell and Libbie,  and now Norma and Alice--five girls I know already! I guess I won't be  homesick or lonely.\"    But as she said it she glanced uncertainly at Bob.    That young man snickered, turned it into a cough, and that failing,  essayed to whistle.    \"Bob, you act too funny for anything!\" This time Betty's glance was not  one of approval. \"What does ail you?\"    \"Nothing, nothing at all, Betsey,\" Bob assured her. \"I'm my usual  charming self. Are Norma and Alice going to Washington first?\"    \"No. I wish they were,\" answered Betty, taking up the letter again.  \"Bob, I'm afraid they're having a hard time with money matters. You know  Dr. Guerin is so easy-going he never collects one-third of the bills he  sends out, and any one can get his services free if they tell him a hard  luck story. Norma writes that she and Alice have always wanted to go to  Shadyside because their mother graduated from there when it was only a  day school. Mrs. Guerin's people lived around there somewhere. And last  year, you know, Norma went to an awfully ordinary school--good enough, I  suppose, but not very thorough. She couldn't prepare for college there.\"    \"Well, couldn't we fix it some way for them?\" asked Bob interestedly.  \"I'd do anything in the world for Doctor Guerin. Didn't he row me that  time he found us out in the fields at two o'clock in the morning? You  think up some way to make him accept some money, Betty.\"    Doctor Hal Guerin and his wife and daughters had been good friends to Bob  and Betty in the Bramble Farm days. The doctor, with a large country  practice that brought him more affection and esteem than ready cash, had  managed to look after the boy and girl more or less effectively, and  Norma, his daughter, had supplied Bob with orders from her school friends  for little carved pendants that he made with no better tools than an old  knife. This money had been the first Bob had ever earned and had given  him his first taste of independence.    \"I don't think you could make Doctor Guerin take money, even as a  loan,\" said Betty slowly, in answer to Bob's proposal. \"Norma wouldn't  like it if she thought her letter had suggested such a thing. What  makes it hard for them, I think, is that Mrs. Guerin expected to have  quite a fortune some day. Her mother was really wealthy, and she was an  only child. I don't know where the money went, but I do know the  Guerins never had any of it.\"    Bob jumped to his feet as she finished the sentence.    \"Here's Uncle Dick!\" he cried. \"Did you see the new well come in, sir?\"          CHAPTER III    SURPRISING BOB      Betty shook back her hair and rose to kiss the gray-haired gentleman who  put an arm affectionately about her.    \"I heard about that blast,\" he said, and smiled good-humoredly. \"Lee  Chang was much worried when I went in to dinner. His one consolation was  that you had eaten the tart before the oil began to fall.\"    \"We were all right, only of course it rather daubed us up,\" said Bob.  \"Betty had to wash her hair.\"    \"My hair's nothing,\" declared Betty scornfully. \"But my brand-new blouse  that I worked on for two days--you ought to see it, Uncle Dick! Grandma  Watterby thinks maybe she can get the oil out, but she says the color may  come out, too.\"    Mr. Gordon sat down on the step and took off his hat.    \"You've a clear claim for damages, Betty,\" he assured his niece gravely.  \"To save time, I'm willing to make good; what does a new blouse cost?\"    \"This wasn't exactly new,\" explained Betty fairly. \"Aunt Faith had the  material in her trunk for years. But it was the first thing I ever made,  and I was so proud of it.\"    \"Well, we'll see that you have something to take its place,\" promised her  uncle, drawing her down beside him. \"I have some news for you, Betsey.  When you go East next week, I'm going, too. That is, as far as Chicago.  From there I take a little run up into Canada.\"    \"But you said you'd spend Christmas with us!\" argued Betty.    \"Oh, Christmas is months off,\" returned Mr. Gordon comfortably. \"I expect  to be back in the States long before the holidays. And Bob's aunts have  finally made up their minds where they want to spend the winter. Aunt  Faith has commissioned me to buy two tickets for southern California.\"    \"But there's Bob!\" Betty gazed anxiously at her uncle. \"What's Bob going  to do without any one at all, Uncle Dick?\"    Mr. Gordon looked at Bob, and an unwilling grin turned the corners of the  boy's mouth.    \"That's the way he's been acting all day,\" scolded Betty. \"What ails  him? I think it's silly to sit there and smile when there's nothing to  smile about.\"    \"I suspect Bob doesn't take kindly to secrets,\" returned her uncle.  \"Suppose you 'fess up, Bob, and when the atmosphere is clear we can have  a little talk.\"    \"All right,\" said Bob, with manifest relief. \"I kept quiet only because I  wanted to be sure I was going, sir. Betty, Mr. Littell wrote me about a  military academy in the East and put me in, touch with several boys who  attend it. Uncle Dick thinks it is just the school for me, and I'm going.  Timothy Derby is one of the boys. He's a son of the man I worked for in  Washington.\"    \"How splendid!\" With characteristic enthusiasm Betty forgot her momentary  displeasure at Bob's method of keeping a secret. \"When are you going,  Bob? Where is the school?\"    \"That's the best part,\" said Bob boyishly. \"It's the Salsette Military  Academy, Betty, and it's right across the lake from the Shadyside school.  All five of the boys Mr. Littell told me of are friends of the Littell  girls, so you see it is going to be great fun all around.\"    \"I never knew of anything so nice!\" declared Betty. \"Never! So you knew  when I told you about Shadyside that you were going to be so near!\"    Bob nodded.    \"Have to keep an eye on you,\" he said with mock seriousness, at which  Betty made a little face.    \"You haven't much time to get ready,\" Mr. Gordon warned them. \"The aunts  will leave Wednesday and our train pulls out at ten twenty-six on Friday  morning. Of course you will do your shopping in Washington and be guided  by the advice of Mr. and Mrs. Littell. I wish I could go to Washington  with you, but that is impossible now. You must write me faithfully, both  of you, though I suppose we'll have to expect the same delay between  letters that we've experienced before. Most of my time will be spent on a  farm thirty miles from a railroad. If you get into any difficulties, go  to the Littells, and for little troubles, help each other.\"    Mr. Gordon went on to say that while Bob and Betty were independent to a  greater degree than most boys and girls of their age, the same force of  circumstances that made this possible also gave them a heavier  responsibility. He explained that each was to have an allowance and asked  that each keep a cash account to be submitted to him on his return from  Canada, not, he said, to serve as a check upon extravagant or foolish  expenditures, but that he might be better able to advise them and to  point out avoidable mistakes.    After supper that night he drew the boy aside for further discussion.    \"I'm really leaving Betty in your charge,\" he said, and Bob stood fully  two inches taller. \"Not that I think she will get into any serious  trouble, but there's no telling what a bevy of high-spirited girls will  think up. And you know what Betty is when once started, she can not be  stopped. I rely on you to keep her confidence and hold her back if she  seems inclined to act rashly. The Littells are splendid people, but they  will be five hours' distance away, while you will be across the lake. I  put my trust in you, Bob.\"    Bob silently resolved to be worthy. Betty had been his first friend, and  to her he gave all the pent-up loyalty and starved affection of a lonely  boy nature. When Mr. Gordon came into his life, and especially when he  was made his legal guardian, Bob experienced the novel sensation of  having some one interested in his future. Though the various older men  he had met were more than willing to help him, Mr. Gordon was the only  one to succeed in winning over Bob's almost fanatical pride and the lad  who admired, respected, and loved him, would have done anything in the  world for him.    The next few days were extremely busy ones for Bob, the aunts, and Betty.  Miss Hope and Miss Charity were so excited at the prospect of a journey  that they completely lost their faculty for planning, and most of the  work fell on Bob and Betty. Luckily there was little packing to be done,  for the few bits of old furniture were to be sold for what they would  bring, and the keepsakes that neither Miss Hope nor her sister could  bring themselves to part with were stored in several old trunks to be  housed in the Watterby attic.    \"Betty, child,\" her uncle's voice broke in upon Betty's orderly packing  one afternoon, \"I know you're going to be disappointed, but we mustn't  cry over what can't be helped. I've had a wire and must leave for  Chicago Wednesday morning. You and Bob will have to make the Washington  trip alone.\"    \"I knew it was too good to be true,\" mourned Betty, a tear dropping on  the yellowed silk shawl she was neatly folding. \"Oh, dear, Uncle Dick, I  did want you to go with us part of the way!\"    \"Better luck next time,\" replied Mr. Gordon. \"There's no use grumbling  over what you can't change.\"    This was his philosophy, and he followed it"]]]
