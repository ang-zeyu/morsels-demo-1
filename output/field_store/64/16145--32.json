If there is any  risk of the instrument getting broken from fall of materials or other  causes, it may be fitted with an ingenious self-acting apparatus shutting  off the supply. For this purpose the water which has passed the  thermometer is made to fall into a funnel hung on the longer arm of a  balanced lever. With an ordinary flow the water stands at a certain height  in the funnel, and, while this is so, the lever remains balanced; but if  from any accident the flow is diminished, the level of the water in the  funnel descends, the other arm of the lever falls, and in doing so  releases two springs, one of which in flying up rings a bell, and the  other by detaching a counterweight closes a cock and stops the supply of  water altogether.    It will be seen that these instruments are not adapted for shifting about  from place to place in order to observe different temperatures, but rather  for following the variations of temperature at one and the same place. For  many purposes this is of great importance. They have been used with great  success in porcelain furnaces, both at the famous manufactories at Sevres  and at another porcelain works in Limoges. From both these establishments  very favorable reports as to their working have been received.--_W.R.  Browne, in Nature_.           *       *       *       *       *    [NATURE.]          THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SOLAR SURFACE.      I have, during the summer solstice of 1884, carried out an experimental  investigation for the purpose of demonstrating the temperature of the  solar surface corresponding with the temperature transmitted to the sun  motor. Referring to the illustrations previously published, it will be  seen that the cylindrical heater of the sun motor, constructed solely for  the purpose of generating steam or expanding air, is not well adapted for  an exact determination of the amount of surface exposed to the action of  the reflected solar rays. It will be perceived on inspection that only  part of the bottom of the cylindrical heater of the motor is acted upon by  the reflected rays, and that their density diminishes _gradually_ toward  the sides of the vessel; also that owing to the imperfections of the  surface of the reflecting plates the exact course of the terminal rays  cannot be defined. Consequently, the most important point in the  investigation, namely, the area acted upon by the reflected radiant heat,  cannot be accurately determined. I have accordingly constructed an  instrument of large dimensions, a polygonal reflector (see Fig. 1),  composed of a series of inclined mirrors, and provided with a central  heater of conical form, acted upon by the reflected radiation in such a  manner that each point of its surface receives an equal amount of radiant  heat in a given time. The said reflector is contained within two regular  polygonal planes twelve inches apart, each having ninety-six sides, the  perimeter of the upper plane corresponding with a circle of eight feet  diameter, that of the lower plane being six feet. The corresponding sides  of these planes are connected by flat taper mirrors composed of thin glass  silvered on the outside. When the reflector faces the sun at right angles,  each mirror intercepts a pencil of rays of 32.61 square inches section,  hence the entire reflecting surface receives the radiant heat of an  annular sunbeam of 32.61 x 96 = 3,130 square inches section. It should be  observed that the area thus stated is 0.011 less than the total  foreshortened superficies of the ninety-six mirrors if sufficiently wide  to come in perfect contact at the vertices. Fig. 2 represents a transverse  section of the instrument as it appears when facing the sun; the direct  and reflected rays being indicated by dotted lines. The reflector and  conical heater are sustained by a flat hub and eight radial spokes bent  upward toward the ends at an angle of 45 deg.. The hub and spokes are  supported by a vertical pivot, by means of which the operator is enabled  to follow the diurnal motion of the sun, while a horizontal axle, secured  to the upper end of the pivot, and held by appropriate bearings under the  hub, enables him to regulate the inclination to correspond with the  altitude of the luminary. The heater is composed of rolled plate iron  0.017 inch thick, and provided with bead and bottom formed of  non-conducting materials. By means of a screw-plug passing through the  bottom and entering the face of the hub the heater may be applied and  removed in the course of five minutes, an important fact, as will be seen  hereafter. It is scarcely necessary to state that the proportion of the  ends of the conical heater should correspond with the perimeters of the  reflector, hence the diameter of the upper end, at the intersection of the  polygonal plane, should be to that of the lower end as 8 to 6, in order  that every part may be acted upon by reflected rays of equal density. This  condition being fulfilled, the temperature communicated will be perfectly  uniform. A short tube passes through the upper head of the heater, through  which a thermometer is inserted for measuring the internal temperature.  The stem being somewhat less than the bore of the tube, a small opening is  formed by which the necessary equilibrium of pressure will be established  with the external atmosphere. It should be mentioned that the indications  of the thermometer during the experiment have been remarkably prompt, the  bulb being subjected to the joint influence of radiation and convection.    The foregoing particulars, it will be found, furnish all necessary data  for determining with absolute precision the _diffusion_ of rays acting on  the central vessel of the solar pyrometer. But the determination of  temperature which uninterrupted solar radiation is capable of transmitting  to the polygonal reflector calls for a correct knowledge of atmospheric  absorption. Besides, an accurate estimate of the loss of radiant heat  attending the reflection of the rays by the mirrors is indispensable. Let  us consider these points separately.    [Illustration: _Fig._ 2.]    _Atmospheric Absorption._--The principal object of conducting the  investigation during the summer solstice has been the facilities afforded  for determining atmospheric absorption, the sun's zenith distance at noon  being only 17 deg. 12' at New York. The retardation of the sun's rays in  passing through a clear atmosphere obviously depends on the depth  penetrated; hence--neglecting the curvature of the atmospheric limit--the  retardation will be as the secants of the zenith distances. Accordingly,  an observation of the temperature produced by solar radiation at a zenith  distance whose secant is _twice_ that of the secant of 17 deg. 12', viz., 61 deg.  28', determines the minimum atmospheric absorption at New York. The result  of observations conducted during a series of years shows that the maximum  solar intensity at 17 deg. 12' reaches 66.2 deg. F., while at a zenith distance of  61 deg. 28' it is 52.5 deg. F.; hence, minimum atmospheric absorption at New York,  during the summer solstice,                                   13.7  is 66.2 deg.-52.5 deg. = 13.7 deg. F., or ------ = 0.207 of the sun's                                 66.2    radiant energy where the rays enter the terrestrial atmosphere.    [Illustration: CAPTAIN ERICSSON'S SOLAR PYROMETER, ERECTED AT NEW YORK,  1884.]    In order to determine the loss of energy attending the reflection of the  rays by the diagonal mirrors, I have constructed a special apparatus,  which, by means of a parallactic mechanism, faces the sun at right angles  during observations. It consists principally of two small mirrors,  manufactured of the same materials as the reflector, placed diagonally at  right angles to each other; a thermometer being applied between the two,  whose stem points toward the sun. The direct solar rays entering through  perforations of an appropriate shade, and reflected by the inclined  mirrors, act simultaneously on opposite sides of the bulb. The mean result  of repeated trials, all differing but slightly, show that the energy of  the direct solar rays acting on the polygonal reflector is reduced 0.235  before reaching the heater.    In accordance with the previous article, the investigation has been based  on the assumption that _the temperatures produced by radiant heat at given  distances from its source are inversely as the diffusion of the rays at  those distances. In other words, the temperature produced by solar  radiation is as the density of the rays._    It will be remembered that Sir Isaac Newton, in estimating the temperature  to which the comet of 1680 was subjected when nearest to the sun, based  his calculations on the result of his practical observations that the  maximum temperature produced by solar radiation was one-third of that of  boiling water. Modern research shows that the observer of 1680 underrated  solar intensity only 5 deg. for the latitude of London. The distance of the  comet from the center of the sun being to the distance of the earth from  the same as 6 to 1,000, the author of the \"Principia\" asserted that the  density of the rays was as 1,000 squared to 6 squared = 28,000 to 1; hence the comet was  subjected to a temperature of 28,000 x 180 deg./3 = 1,680,000 deg., an intensity  exactly \"2,000 times greater than that of red-hot iron\" at a temperature  of 840 deg.. The distance of the comet from the solar surface being equal to  one-third of the sun's radius, it will be seen that, in accordance with  the Newtonian doctrine, the temperature to which it was subjected  indicated a solar intensity of    4 squared x 1,680,000  -------------- = 2,986,000 deg. F.       3    The writer has established the correctness of the assumption that \"the  temperature is as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11649"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 799, April 25, 1891 (#3)"],[1," floating the ship with failure.    It has been seen that the method of raising the Ulunda was very simple.  She was floated off by the rising tide. If there had been only a small  instead of an 18 foot rise, some other mode would have to have been  adopted. No attempt was made to stop any of the leaks, except the one  just stated, but a deck above the lacerations was made water-tight, and  this, together with the sides of the ship hanging down, formed a kind of  diving bell, the pressure of air in which, caused by the water outside,  acting on this deck, being the principal means of buoying up the ship,  assisted by the buoyancy of the two water-tight compartments. The deck  afterward built was only necessary for the safety of the ship, she being  able to float without it; but it would have been suicidal to trust the  ship on the Atlantic in the state she was in when raised, since with any  swell on, the compressed air would escape and its place be taken by  water, the buoyancy necessary for keeping her afloat being thus lost.    It only remains to be said that the risks run in steaming around to  Halifax by herself were, as it was, very great, and had the wind and sea  been less favorable, the undertaking would probably have proved a  disastrous failure.           *       *       *       *       *          THE THERMIC MOTOR OF THE FUTURE?      Up to recent years there was no reason for putting the question that  forms the title of this article, for it was admitted by all that the  conversion of thermic energy, or heat produced by the combustion of  coal, into mechanical energy or work could no longer be effected  economically except by having recourse to steam. In ordinary language,  and even to manufacturers, steam engine was the equivalent of thermic  motor, and it would not have occurred to any one to use anything else  but steam to effect the transformation.    The progress that has been made during the last twenty years in the  thermatic study and construction of gas motors (without speaking of hot  air motors) has shown that the use of steam is not absolutely  indispensable for the production of work, and it has demonstrated that,  as regards dynamic product, the gas motor preserves the advantage,  although the relatively high price of the illuminating gas employed in  the production of the motive power generally renders the use of this  combustible more costly than steam, especially for high powers.    The economic truth of twenty years ago, when gas motors absorbed 1,500  liters per horse hour and exceeded with difficulty an effective power of  from 8 to 10 horses, has become less and less certain, when the  consumption has successively descended to 1,200, 1,000, 800 and even to  600 liters of gas per horse hour, the power of the motors rising  gradually to 25, 50 and 100 horses with a motor having a single cylinder  of a diameter of 57 centimeters.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--CORLISS ENGINE AND BOILER OF 100 INDICATED  H.P.--ELEVATION AND PLAN.    A, cylinder; B, condenser; C, boiler; R, feed water heater; D, chimney.]    But these results did not suffice, and it was desired to do better still  by dispensing with the use of high priced illuminating gas. An endeavor  was made to obviate the difficulty by manufacturing a special gas for  the motive power, as steam is produced for the same object, by  distilling coal, carbureting air, producing water gas by the Dowson  process, and by other equivalent processes.    The strides made in this direction were finally crowned with success,  and the results obtained in the recent experiments due to Mr. Aime Witz,  an undoubted authority in the matter, permit of affirming that now and  hereafter, in many circumstances, a gas generator supplying a gas motor  will be able to advantageously dethrone a steam boiler supplying a steam  engine of the same power.    These conclusions, which tend to nothing less than to limit the reign of  the steam engine, are confirmed on the one hand by an experiment carried  on for the last two years in the Barataud flour mill of Marseilles,  where a 50 h.p. \"Simplex\" motor has been running day and night for  several months without stopping, and consuming but about 500 grammes of  English anthracite per effective horse hour, and, on another hand, by  some personal experiments of Mr. Witz's, to which we shall shortly  advert, and whence there results a sensibly equivalent production for a  motor of 100 indicated h.p., corresponding to a power of 75 effective  horses.    Before establishing, with Mr. Witz, a comparison of the two systems in  pressure, steam or gas, let us state in a few words in what the latter  consists, the steam engine and the boiler that supplies it being so well  known that no description is necessary.    The Dowson gas generator does not differ essentially from the numerous  generators devised during recent years for the manufacture of gaseous  combustibles, the use of which is so often convenient. The motor that it  supplies is the most powerful single cylinder one that has hitherto been  constructed. It is of 100 indicated h.p., and its normal angular  velocity is 100 revolutions per minute. On trial it has yielded 112  indicated h.p., and 76.8 effective h.p., corresponding to an organic  rendering of 69 per cent. This motor, elaborated by Messrs.  Delamare-Bouteville & Malandin, of Rouen, operates by compression and in  four periods, according to the Beau de Rochas cycle. We give the aspect  of it in Fig. 3. In the first period the mixture of air and gas is  sucked in, in the second it is compressed, in the third it is ignited,  and in the fourth the products of combustion are expelled.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--SIMPLEX MOTOR, DOWSON GENERATOR OF 100 INDICATED  H.P.--ELEVATION AND PLAN.

The angular  velocity is regulated by a Watt's governor, which secures an isochronism  of the motion independently of the charge.    The setting in motion of so powerful an engine is effected very easily  by means of an arrangement that permits of introducing into the  cylinder, while the piston is in the center of the stroke, a mixture of  air and gas whose pressure is sufficient at the arrival to expel the  inert products. After this the ignition takes place, and the explosion  is sufficient to set the motor in motion.    The trials made by Mr. Witz with the motor represented in Fig. 3 gave  the following results, deduced from an experiment of 68 hours. The  figures relate to one effective horse power, measured with the brake  upon the shaft of the motor.      Consumption of anthracite.              516 grammes.         \"       \" coke.                     96    \"    Consumption of water for the injection      of steam.                               0.487 liters.

Consumption of grease.                    0.45    \"    Consumption of gas reduced to      0 deg. C. and to 760 mm.                2,370    liters.    This last figure will appear very high, but the fact must not be lost  sight of that it is a question of poor gas, the net cost of which varies  between one and two centimes per cubic meter, and the calorific power of  which is but 1,487 heat units per cubic meter of constant volume, and  supposing the steam condensed. This combustion of 612 grammes of  combustible per effective horse hour is remarkable, and fully shows what  may be expected of the gas motor supplied by a gas generator in putting  to profit certain improvements that will hereafter be possible, such,  for example, as the lightening of the movable parts of the motor, the  bettering of its organic rendering (now quite feeble), the use of better  oils, the reduction of the consumption of water, the superheating of the  steam injected into the gas generator, etc.    A well constructed steam engine, carefully kept in repair and as much  improved as it is possible to make it, would certainly consume twice as  much coal to produce the same quantity of effective work, say at least  1,200 grammes per horse hour. But, as has been objected with reason, it  does not suffice to compare the figures as to the consumption of fuel in  order to institute a serious comparison between the steam engine and the  motor using poor gas.    The gas generator requires the use of English anthracite, while a steam  boiler is heated with any kind of coal. The prices of unity of weight  are therefore very different. Moreover, the gas motor necessitates an  immense amount of water for the washing of the gas and the cooling of  the cylinder, through circulation in the jacket. It is well to keep this  fact in view. On another hand, the lubrification of the cylinders  requires a profusion of oil whose flashing point must be at a very high  temperature, else it would burn at every explosion and fill the cylinder  with coom. Such oil is very costly.    Does not the expenditure of oil in large motors largely offset the  saving in coal? And then, gas motors are sold at high prices, as are gas  generators, and this installation necessarily requires the addition of a  large gasometer, scrubbers, etc. The wear of these apparatus is rapid,  and if we take into account the interest and amortization of the capital  engaged, we shall find that the use of steam is still more economical.  The obstruction caused by bulky apparatus is another inconvenience, upon  which it is"]]]
