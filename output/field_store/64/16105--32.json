Douglass had learned to read, partly from childish curiosity and the  desire to be able to do what others around him did; but it was with a  definite end in view that he learned to write. By the slave code  it was unlawful for a slave to go beyond the limits of his own  neighborhood without the written permission of his master. Douglass's  desire to write grew mainly out of the fact that in order to escape  from bondage, which he had early determined to do, he would probably  need such a \"pass,\" as this written permission was termed, and could  write it himself if he but knew how. His master for the time being  kept a ship-yard, and in this and neighboring establishments of  the same kind the boy spent much of his time. He noticed that the  carpenters, after dressing pieces of timber, marked them with certain  letters to indicate their positions in the vessel. By asking questions  of the workmen he learned the names of these letters and their  significance. He got up writing matches with sticks upon the ground  with the little white boys, copied the italics in his spelling-book,  and in the secrecy of the attic filled up all the blank spaces of his  young master's old copy-books. In time he learned to write, and thus  again demonstrated the power of the mind to overleap the bounds that  men set for it and work out the destiny to which God designs it.          II.      It was the curious fate of Douglass to pass through almost every phase  of slavery, as though to prepare him the more thoroughly for his  future career. Shortly after he went to Baltimore, his master, Captain  Anthony, died intestate, and his property was divided between his two  children. Douglass, with the other slaves, was part of the personal  estate, and was sent for to be appraised and disposed of in the  division. He fell to the share of Mrs. Lucretia Auld, his masters  daughter, who sent him back to Baltimore, where, after a month's  absence, he resumed his life in the household of Mrs. Hugh Auld,  the sister-in-law of his legal mistress. Owing to a family  misunderstanding, he was taken, in March, 1833, from Baltimore back to  St. Michaels.    His mistress, Lucretia Auld, had died in the mean time; and the new  household in which he found himself, with Thomas Auld and his second  wife, Rowena, at its head, was distinctly less favorable to the slave  boy's comfort than the home where he had lived in Baltimore. Here he  saw hardships of the life in bondage that had been less apparent in a  large city. It is to be feared that Douglass was not the ideal slave,  governed by the meek and lowly spirit of Uncle Tom. He seems, by his  own showing, to have manifested but little appreciation of the wise  oversight, the thoughtful care, and the freedom from responsibility  with which slavery claimed to hedge round its victims, and he was  inclined to spurn the rod rather than to kiss it. A tendency to  insubordination, due partly to the freer life he had led in Baltimore,  got him into disfavor with a master easily displeased; and, not  proving sufficiently amenable to the discipline of the home  plantation, he was sent to a certain celebrated negro-breaker by the  name of Edward Covey, one of the poorer whites who, as overseers and  slave-catchers, and in similar unsavory capacities, earned a living as  parasites on the system of slavery. Douglass spent a year under Coveys  ministrations, and his life there may be summed up in his own words:  \"I had neither sufficient time in which to eat nor to sleep, except on  Sundays. The overwork and the brutal chastisements of which I was the  victim, combined with that ever-gnawing and soul-destroying thought,  'I am a slave,--a slave for life,' rendered me a living embodiment of  mental and physical wretchedness.\"    But even all this did not entirely crush the indomitable spirit of a  man destined to achieve his own freedom and thereafter to help win  freedom for a race. In August, 1834, after a particularly atrocious  beating, which left him wounded and weak from loss of blood, Douglass  escaped the vigilance of the slave-breaker and made his way back to  his own master to seek protection. The master, who would have lost  his slave's wages for a year if he had broken the contract with  Covey before the year's end, sent Douglass back to his taskmaster.  Anticipating the most direful consequences, Douglass made the  desperate resolution to resist any further punishment at Covey's  hands. After a fight of two hours Covey gave up his attempt to whip  Frederick, and thenceforth laid hands on him no more. That Covey did  not invoke the law, which made death the punishment of the slave who  resisted his master, was probably due to shame at having been worsted  by a negro boy, or to the prudent consideration that there was no  profit to be derived from a dead negro. Strength of character,  re-enforced by strength of muscle, thus won a victory over brute force  that secured for Douglass comparative immunity from abuse during the  remaining months of his year's service with Covey.    The next year, 1835, Douglass was hired out to a Mr. William Freeland,  who lived near St. Michael's, a gentleman who did not forget justice  or humanity, so far as they were consistent with slavery, even  in dealing with bond-servants. Here Douglass led a comparatively  comfortable life. He had enough to eat, was not overworked, and found  the time to conduct a surreptitious Sunday-school, where he tried to  help others by teaching his fellow-slaves to read the Bible.          III.      The manner of Douglass's escape from Maryland was never publicly  disclosed by him until the war had made slavery a memory and  the slave-catcher a thing of the past. It was the theory of the  anti-slavery workers of the time that the publication of the details  of escapes or rescues from bondage seldom reached the ears of those  who might have learned thereby to do likewise, but merely furnished  the master class with information that would render other escapes  more difficult and bring suspicion or punishment upon those who had  assisted fugitives. That this was no idle fear there is abundant  testimony in the annals of the period. But in later years, when there  was no longer any danger of unpleasant consequences, and when it had  become an honor rather than a disgrace to have assisted a distressed  runaway, Douglass published in detail the story of his flight. It  would not compare in dramatic interest with many other celebrated  escapes from slavery or imprisonment. He simply masqueraded as a  sailor, borrowed a sailors \"protection,\" or certificate that he  belonged to the navy, took the train to Baltimore in the evening, and  rode in the negro car until he reached New York City. There were many  anxious moments during this journey. The \"protection\" he carried  described a man somewhat different from him, but the conductor did not  examine it carefully. Fear clutched at the fugitive's heart whenever  he neared a State border line. He saw several persons whom he knew;  but, if they recognized him or suspected his purpose, they made no  sign. A little boldness, a little address, and a great deal of good  luck carried him safely to his journey's end.    Douglass arrived in New York on September 4, 1838, having attained  only a few months before what would have been in a freeman his legal  majority. But, though landed in a free State, he was by no means a  free man. He was still a piece of property, and could be reclaimed  by the law's aid if his whereabouts were discovered. While local  sentiment at the North afforded a measure of protection to fugitives,  and few were ever returned to bondage compared with the number that  escaped, yet the fear of recapture was ever with them, darkening their  lives and impeding their pursuit of happiness.    But even the partial freedom Douglass had achieved gave birth to a  thousand delightful sensations. In his autobiography he describes this  dawn of liberty thus:    \"A new world had opened up to me. I lived more in one day than in a  year of my slave life. I felt as one might feel upon escape from a den  of hungry lions. My chains were broken, and the victory brought me  unspeakable joy.\"    But one cannot live long on joy; and, while his chains were broken,  he was not beyond the echo of their clanking. He met on the streets,  within a few hours after his arrival in New York, a man of his own  color, who informed him that New York was full of Southerners at that  season of the year, and that slave-hunters and spies were numerous,  that old residents of the city were not safe, and that any recent  fugitive was in imminent danger. After this cheerful communication  Douglass's informant left him, evidently fearing that Douglass himself  might be a slave-hunting spy. There were negroes base enough to play  this role. In a sailor whom he encountered he found a friend. This  Good Samaritan took him home for the night, and accompanied him next  day to a Mr. David Ruggles, a colored man, the secretary of the New  York Vigilance Committee and an active antislavery worker. Mr. Ruggles  kept him concealed for several days, during which time the woman  Douglass loved, a free woman, came on from Baltimore; and they were  married. He had no money in his pocket, and nothing to depend upon but  his hands, which doubtless seemed to him quite a valuable possession,  as he knew they had brought in an income of several hundred dollars a  year to their former owner.    Douglass's new friends advised him to go to New Bedford,  Massachusetts, where whaling fleets were fitted out, and where he  might hope to find work at his trade of ship-calker. It was believed,  too, that he would be safer there, as the anti-slavery sentiment was  considered too strong to permit a fugitive slave's being returned to  the South.

[Sidenote: Differences between Ancient and Modern Conditions of  Thought.]    But the enormous interval of time separating us from those early Indian  thinkers necessarily involves very great differences in conditions of  thought. And we should not be surprised if amidst much in their writings  that stirs our sympathy, there is also a great deal which is to us  incongruous and absurd. Therefore, it may be well before quoting these  writings to note one or two points marking an almost incommensurable  difference between their mode and ours of regarding the world.    [Sidenote: 1. Survival In their day of Fetishistic and Animistic Ideas.]    1. First, they were much less removed than we are from the influence of  fetishistic and animistic traditions. Even in the Greek and Roman  classics the casual reader is often revolted by the grossly absurd  stories told of gods and heroes. And, indeed, it is impossible to  conceive of the amours of Zeus (or Jove), for instance, with Leda,  Europa or Danae as having been first conceived during an age marked by  the poetic genius and comparative culture evinced in the most ancient  epics. But the most probable solution of the puzzle is that the earliest  civilization inherited a number of animal stories, such as are  characteristic of savagery in all parts of the world, and that the first  literary generations into whose poetic myths those stories were  transferred, being as much accustomed to them as to other surroundings  of their childhood, such as bloody sacrifices, mystic expiations, and  fantastic initiations, saw no incongruity in anything told them of the  gods. Besides, as those wild myths were associated with sacred rites,  the inveterate conservatism of religion, which insisted on stone knives  in sacrifices long after bronze and iron came in, was likely enough to  maintain the divine importance of those fables, just as the historicity  of Balaam's ass and Jonah's whale is in some churches piously upheld  still.    [Sidenote: 2. Ancient Ignorance of Natural Order.]    2. In the times from which the first known Pantheistic teaching dates,  ideas of nature's order were incongruous and indeed incommensurable with  ours. Not that the world was then regarded as a chaos. But such order as  existed was considered to be a kind of \"balance of power\" between  various unseen beings, some good, some evil, some indifferent. True,  some Indian prophets projected an idea of One Eternal Being including  all such veiled Principalities and Powers. But their Pantheism was  necessarily conditioned by their ignorance of natural phenomena. In  fact, an irreducible inconsistency marred their view of the world. For  while their Pantheism should have taught them to think of a universal  life or energy as working within all things, their theological habit of  mind bound them to the incongruous notion of devils or deities moulding,  or at least ruling, matter from without. And, indeed, the nearest  approach they made to the more genuine Pantheism of modern times was the  conception of a world emanating from and projected outside Brahma, to be  re-merged in him after the lapse of ages. Now, if I am right in my  definition of Pantheism as absolutely identifying God with the  Universe,[3] so that, in fact, there cannot be anything but God, the  inconsistency here noted must be regarded as fatal to the genuineness of  the Indian or indeed of any other ancient Pantheism. For the defect  proved during many centuries to be incurable, and was not indeed fully  removed until Spinoza's time.    [Sidenote: 3. Absence of Definite Creeds.]    3. Another difference between ancient Pantheists and ourselves was the  absence in their case of any religious creed, sanctioned by supernatural  authority and embodied in a definite form, like that of the three  Anglican creeds, or the Westminster Confession of Faith. Not that those  ancients supposed themselves to be without a revelation. For the Vedas,  at least, were considered to be of divine authority, and their words,  metres, and grammar were regarded with a superstitious awe, such as  reminds us of what has been called the \"bibliolatry\" of the Jewish  Rabbis. But subject to this verbal veneration, the Rishis, or learned  divines, used the utmost freedom in regard to the forced and fanciful  interpretations extorted from the sacred text, a freedom which again  reminds us of the paradoxical caprice shown by some schools of Jewish  Rabbis in their treatment of the volume they professed to regard with  awe. The various finite gods, such as Vishnu, Indra, Krishna, Marut, or  Varuna, were not the subjects of any church creed chanted every day, and  carefully stereotyped in the tender minds of children. On the contrary,  various roles were assigned by successive generations to these  divinities. So that, for instance, Varuna was at one time the god of the  ocean, and at another of the sky. But the uniform tendency of all poets  and Rishis alike was to seek, beyond all these gods, one unbeginning,  unending, and all comprehensive Being, from whom these \"devas\" emerged,  and into whom they must return. Not only so, but it is clearly suggested  in many passages, of which an instance will presently be quoted, that  the Eternal, called Brahma who was the true Self of all gods, was also  the true Self of man and bird and beast. So that, in fact,  notwithstanding the illogical emanation theory, He was the only real  Being, the All in All.    [Sidenote: Illustration from the Upanishads.]    [Sidenote: Monism.]    Thus, one section of the Khandogya Upanishad[4] consists entirely of  instructions given by a father, Uddalaka, to his son, Svetaketu, who had  gone through the ordinary courses of study in the Vedas, but who, in the  father's view, had failed to reach the true significance of life.  Accordingly, Uddalaka inquires: \"Have you ever asked for that  instruction by which we hear what cannot be heard, by which we perceive  what cannot be perceived, by which we know what cannot be known?\"[5] The  youth, more accustomed than we are to teaching by paradox, expresses no  surprise at this mode of putting things, but simply asks: \"What is that  instruction, sir?\" The father then proceeds to give an explanation of  what in these days is called \"Monism,\" that is, the absolute singleness  of ultimate Being, and traces all that is, or seems to be, up to one  ultimate Essence. Now, whether in the form given by Uddalaka to his  exposition, his theory can properly be called Pantheism, according to  the definition of it assumed above, is perhaps questionable. But that it  was intended to be Pantheism there can be no doubt. \"In the beginning,\"  says Uddalaka, \"there was that only which is ([Greek: to hon]); one  only, without a second. Others say, in the beginning there was that only  which is not ([Greek: to mae hon]); one only, without a second; and from  that which is not, that which is was born.\" But Uddalaka rejects this  latter doctrine as unthinkable--which, indeed, many explorers of Hegel  have found with pain and anguish of mind. And then the father traces all  the multiformity of the Universe to the desire or will of the original  One, \"that which is.\"    [Sidenote: Evolution from the One through Desire.]    \"It thought, 'may I be many; may I grow forth.' It sent forth fire.\" My  limits do not allow me to quote further the fantastic account given of  the farther process by which water and earth, plants, animals, and men  sprang out of that desire of the One: \"May I become many; may I grow  forth.\" For our purpose it is more important to show that in the view of  Uddalaka--however inconsistently he may express himself--the original  One was never really divided, but remains the true Self of every finite  being, however apparently separate. Thus, consider the following  dialogue, the first words being a direction of the father, Uddalaka:--    \"Fetch me from thence a fruit of the Nyagrodha tree.\" \"Here is one,  sir.\" \"Break it.\" \"It is broken, sir.\" \"What do you see there?\" \"These  seeds, almost infinitesimal.\" \"Break one of them.\" \"It is broken, sir.\"  \"What do you see there?\" \"Not anything, sir.\" The father said: \"My son,  that subtile essence which you do not perceive there, of that very  essence this great Nyagrodha tree exists. Believe it, my son. That which  is the subtile essence, in it all that exists has itself. It is the  True. It is the Self; and thou, O Svetaketu, art it.\"    Here we are clearly taught that the \"self,\" or inmost reality of every  person and thing is the Eternal One, or Brahma, or God.    [Sidenote: Illustration from the Bhagavad Gita.]    The same doctrine is taught in a more advanced form by the poem called  the \"Bhagavad Gita,\" the date of which is probably more than a thousand  years later than that of the Upanishad just quoted. In this poem,  Krishna, incarnate for the nonce as Arjuna's charioteer, reveals for a  special purpose his identity with Brahma, the Eternal All; and Arjuna,  when sufficiently instructed adores him thus:--      \"O infinite Lord of Gods! the world's abode,     Thou undivided art, o'er all supreme.     Thou art the first of Gods, the ancient Sire,     The treasure-house supreme of all the worlds.     The Knowing and the Known, the highest seat.     From Thee the All has sprung, O boundless Form!     Varuna, Vayu, Agni, Yama thou,[6]     The Moon; the Sire and Grandsire too of men.       The Infinite in power, of boundless force,     The All thou dost embrace; the Thou art All.\"[7]    [Sidenote: Omission of Buddhism.]    These illustrations must suffice for Indian Pantheism.
