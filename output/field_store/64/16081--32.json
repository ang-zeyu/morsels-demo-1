Whatever fantastic objection you may have taken to it, I wear this  jacket.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    He went on with his unpacking. I said no more on the subject. I had won  the victory, and we Woosters do not triumph over a beaten foe. Presently,  having completed my toilet, I bade the man a cheery farewell and in  generous mood suggested that, as I was dining out, why didn't he take the  evening off and go to some improving picture or something. Sort of olive  branch, if you see what I mean.    He didn't seem to think much of it.    \"Thank you, sir, I will remain in.\"    I surveyed him narrowly.    \"Is this dudgeon, Jeeves?\"    \"No, sir, I am obliged to remain on the premises. Mr. Fink-Nottle  informed me he would be calling to see me this evening.\"    \"Oh, Gussie's coming, is he? Well, give him my love.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And a whisky and soda, and so forth.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"Right ho, Jeeves.\"    I then set off for the Drones.    At the Drones I ran into Pongo Twistleton, and he talked so much about  the forthcoming merry-making of his, of which good reports had already  reached me through my correspondents, that it was nearing eleven when I  got home again.    And scarcely had I opened the door when I heard voices in the  sitting-room, and scarcely had I entered the sitting-room when I found  that these proceeded from Jeeves and what appeared at first sight to be  the Devil.    A closer scrutiny informed me that it was Gussie Fink-Nottle, dressed as  Mephistopheles.        -2-      \"What-ho, Gussie,\" I said.    You couldn't have told it from my manner, but I was feeling more than a  bit nonplussed. The spectacle before me was enough to nonplus anyone. I  mean to say, this Fink-Nottle, as I remembered him, was the sort of shy,  shrinking goop who might have been expected to shake like an aspen if  invited to so much as a social Saturday afternoon at the vicarage. And  yet here he was, if one could credit one's senses, about to take part in  a fancy-dress ball, a form of entertainment notoriously a testing  experience for the toughest.    And he was attending that fancy-dress ball, mark you--not, like every  other well-bred Englishman, as a Pierrot, but as Mephistopheles--this  involving, as I need scarcely stress, not only scarlet tights but a  pretty frightful false beard.    Rummy, you'll admit. However, one masks one's feelings. I betrayed no  vulgar astonishment, but, as I say, what-hoed with civil nonchalance.    He grinned through the fungus--rather sheepishly, I thought.    \"Oh, hullo, Bertie.\"    \"Long time since I saw you. Have a spot?\"    \"No, thanks. I must be off in a minute. I just came round to ask Jeeves  how he thought I looked. How do you think I look, Bertie?\"    Well, the answer to that, of course, was \"perfectly foul\". But we  Woosters are men of tact and have a nice sense of the obligations of a  host. We do not tell old friends beneath our roof-tree that they are an  offence to the eyesight. I evaded the question.    \"I hear you're in London,\" I said carelessly.    \"Oh, yes.\"    \"Must be years since you came up.\"    \"Oh, yes.\"    \"And now you're off for an evening's pleasure.\"    He shuddered a bit. He had, I noticed, a hunted air.    \"Pleasure!\"    \"Aren't you looking forward to this rout or revel?\"    \"Oh, I suppose it'll be all right,\" he said, in a toneless voice.  \"Anyway, I ought to be off, I suppose. The thing starts round about  eleven. I told my cab to wait.... Will you see if it's there, Jeeves?\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    There was something of a pause after the door had closed. A certain  constraint. I mixed myself a beaker, while Gussie, a glutton for  punishment, stared at himself in the mirror. Finally I decided that it  would be best to let him know that I was abreast of his affairs. It might  be that it would ease his mind to confide in a sympathetic man of  experience. I have generally found, with those under the influence, that  what they want more than anything is the listening ear.    \"Well, Gussie, old leper,\" I said, \"I've been hearing all about you.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"This little trouble of yours. Jeeves has told me everything.\"    He didn't seem any too braced. It's always difficult to be sure, of  course, when a chap has dug himself in behind a Mephistopheles beard, but  I fancy he flushed a trifle.    \"I wish Jeeves wouldn't go gassing all over the place. It was supposed to  be confidential.\"    I could not permit this tone.    \"Dishing up the dirt to the young master can scarcely be described as  gassing all over the place,\" I said, with a touch of rebuke. \"Anyway,  there it is. I know all. And I should like to begin,\" I said, sinking my  personal opinion that the female in question was a sloppy pest in my  desire to buck and encourage, \"by saying that Madeline Bassett is a  charming girl. A winner, and just the sort for you.\"    \"You don't know her?\"    \"Certainly I know her. What beats me is how you ever got in touch. Where  did you meet?\"    \"She was staying at a place near mine in Lincolnshire the week before  last.\"    \"Yes, but even so. I didn't know you called on the neighbours.\"    \"I don't. I met her out for a walk with her dog. The dog had got a thorn  in its foot, and when she tried to take it out, it snapped at her. So, of  course, I had to rally round.\"    \"You extracted the thorn?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And fell in love at first sight?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, dash it, with a thing like that to give you a send-off, why didn't  you cash in immediately?\"    \"I hadn't the nerve.\"    \"What happened?\"    \"We talked for a bit.\"    \"What about?\"    \"Oh, birds.\"    \"Birds? What birds?\"    \"The birds that happened to be hanging round. And the scenery, and all  that sort of thing. And she said she was going to London, and asked me  to look her up if I was ever there.\"    \"And even after that you didn't so much as press her hand?\"    \"Of course not.\"    Well, I mean, it looked as though there was no more to be said. If a chap  is such a rabbit that he can't get action when he's handed the thing on a  plate, his case would appear to be pretty hopeless. Nevertheless, I  reminded myself that this non-starter and I had been at school together.  One must make an effort for an old school friend.    \"Ah, well,\" I said, \"we must see what can be done. Things may brighten.  At any rate, you will be glad to learn that I am behind you in this  enterprise. You have Bertram Wooster in your corner, Gussie.\"    \"Thanks, old man. And Jeeves, of course, which is the thing that really  matters.\"    I don't mind admitting that I winced. He meant no harm, I suppose, but  I'm bound to say that this tactless speech nettled me not a little.  People are always nettling me like that. Giving me to understand, I mean  to say, that in their opinion Bertram Wooster is a mere cipher and that  the only member of the household with brains and resources is Jeeves.    It jars on me.    And tonight it jarred on me more than usual, because I was feeling pretty  dashed fed with Jeeves. Over that matter of the mess jacket, I mean.  True, I had forced him to climb down, quelling him, as described, with  the quiet strength of my personality, but I was still a trifle shirty at  his having brought the thing up at all. It seemed to me that what Jeeves  wanted was the iron hand.    \"And what is he doing about it?\" I inquired stiffly.    \"He's been giving the position of affairs a lot of thought.\"    \"He has, has he?\"    \"It's on his advice that I'm going to this dance.\"    \"Why?\"    \"She is going to be there. In fact, it was she who sent me the ticket of  invitation. And Jeeves considered----\"    \"And why not as a Pierrot?\" I said, taking up the point which had struck  me before. \"Why this break with a grand old tradition?\"    \"He particularly wanted me to go as Mephistopheles.\"    I started.    \"He did, did he? He specifically recommended that definite costume?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Ha!\"    \"Eh?\"    \"Nothing. Just 'Ha!'\"    And I'll tell you why I said \"Ha!\" Here was Jeeves making heavy weather  about me wearing a perfectly ordinary white mess jacket, a garment not  only _tout ce qu'il y a de chic_, but absolutely _de rigueur_, and in the  same breath, as you might say, inciting Gussie Fink-Nottle to be a blot  on the London scene in scarlet tights. Ironical, what? One looks askance  at this sort of in-and-out running.    \"What has he got against Pierrots?\"    \"I don't think he objects to Pierrots as Pierrots. But in my case he  thought a Pierrot wouldn't be adequate.\"    \"I don't follow that.\"    \"He said that the costume of Pierrot, while pleasing to the eye, lacked  the authority of the Mephistopheles costume.\"    \"I still don't get it.\"    \"Well, it's a matter of psychology, he said.\"    There was a time when a remark like that would have had me snookered. But  long association with Jeeves has developed the Wooster vocabulary  considerably. Jeeves has always been a whale for the psychology of the  individual, and I now follow him like a bloodhound when he snaps it out  of the bag.    \"Oh, psychology?\"    \"Yes. Jeeves is a great believer in the moral effect of clothes. He  thinks I might be emboldened in a striking costume like this. He said a  Pirate Chief would be just as good. In fact, a Pirate Chief was his first  suggestion, but I objected to the boots.\"    I saw his point. There is enough sadness in life without having fellows  like Gussie Fink-Nottle going about in sea boots.    \"And are you emboldened?\"    \"Well, to be absolutely accurate, Bertie, old man, no.\"    A gust of compassion shook me. After all, though we had lost touch a bit  of recent years, this man and I had once thrown inked darts at each  other.    \"Gussie,\" I said, \"take an old friend's advice, and don't go within a  mile of this binge.\"    \"But it's my last chance of seeing her. She's off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10556"],[0,"The Old Man in the Corner (#3)"],[1,"land of importance and notoriety. Sir Arthur Inglewood,  I think, disappointed him by stating that he had no questions to ask of  him. Mueller had been brimful of answers, ready with the most perfect  indictment, the most elaborate accusations against the bloated  millionaire who had decoyed his dear friend Kershaw, and murdered him in  Heaven knows what an out-of-the-way corner of the East End.    \"After this, however, the excitement grew apace. Mueller had been  dismissed, and had retired from the court altogether, leading away Mrs.  Kershaw, who had completely broken down.    \"Constable D 21 was giving evidence as to the arrest in the meanwhile.  The prisoner, he said, had seemed completely taken by surprise, not  understanding the cause or history of the accusation against him;  however, when put in full possession of the facts, and realizing, no  doubt, the absolute futility of any resistance, he had quietly enough  followed the constable into the cab. No one at the fashionable and  crowded Hotel Cecil had even suspected that anything unusual had  occurred.    \"Then a gigantic sigh of expectancy came from every one of the  spectators. The 'fun' was about to begin. James Buckland, a porter at  Fenchurch Street railway station, had just sworn to tell all the truth,  etc. After all, it did not amount to much. He said that at six o'clock  in the afternoon of December the 10th, in the midst of one of the  densest fogs he ever remembers, the 5.5 from Tilbury steamed into the  station, being just about an hour late. He was on the arrival platform,  and was hailed by a passenger in a first-class carriage. He could see  very little of him beyond an enormous black fur coat and a travelling  cap of fur also.    \"The passenger had a quantity of luggage, all marked F.S., and he  directed James Buckland to place it all upon a four-wheel cab, with the  exception of a small hand-bag, which he carried himself. Having seen  that all his luggage was safely bestowed, the stranger in the fur coat  paid the porter, and, telling the cabman to wait until he returned, he  walked away in the direction of the waiting-rooms, still carrying his  small hand-bag.    \"'I stayed for a bit,' added James Buckland, 'talking to the driver  about the fog and that; then I went about my business, seein' that the  local from Southend 'ad been signalled.'    \"The prosecution insisted most strongly upon the hour when the stranger  in the fur coat, having seen to his luggage, walked away towards the  waiting-rooms. The porter was emphatic. 'It was not a minute later than  6.15,' he averred.    \"Sir Arthur Inglewood still had no questions to ask, and the driver of  the cab was called.    \"He corroborated the evidence of James Buckland as to the hour when the  gentleman in the fur coat had engaged him, and having filled his cab in  and out with luggage, had told him to wait. And cabby did wait. He  waited in the dense fog--until he was tired, until he seriously thought  of depositing all the luggage in the lost property office, and of  looking out for another fare--waited until at last, at a quarter before  nine, whom should he see walking hurriedly towards his cab but the  gentleman in the fur coat and cap, who got in quickly and told the  driver to take him at once to the Hotel Cecil. This, cabby declared, had  occurred at a quarter before nine. Still Sir Arthur Inglewood made no  comment, and Mr. Francis Smethurst, in the crowded, stuffy court, had  calmly dropped to sleep.    \"The next witness, Constable Thomas Taylor, had noticed a shabbily  dressed individual, with shaggy hair and beard, loafing about the  station and waiting-rooms in the afternoon of December the 10th. He  seemed to be watching the arrival platform of the Tilbury and Southend  trains.    \"Two separate and independent witnesses, cleverly unearthed by the  police, had seen this same shabbily dressed individual stroll into the  first-class waiting-room at about 6.15 on Wednesday, December the 10th,  and go straight up to a gentleman in a heavy fur coat and cap, who had  also just come into the room. The two talked together for a while; no  one heard what they said, but presently they walked off together. No one  seemed to know in which direction.    \"Francis Smethurst was rousing himself from his apathy; he whispered to  his lawyer, who nodded with a bland smile of encouragement. The employes  of the Hotel Cecil gave evidence as to the arrival of Mr. Smethurst at  about 9.30 p.m. on Wednesday, December the 10th, in a cab, with a  quantity of luggage; and this closed the case for the prosecution.    \"Everybody in that court already _saw_ Smethurst mounting the gallows.  It was uninterested curiosity which caused the elegant audience to wait  and hear what Sir Arthur Inglewood had to say. He, of course, is the  most fashionable man in the law at the present moment. His lolling  attitudes, his drawling speech, are quite the rage, and imitated by the  gilded youth of society.    \"Even at this moment, when the Siberian millionaire's neck literally and  metaphorically hung in the balance, an expectant titter went round the  fair spectators as Sir Arthur stretched out his long loose limbs and  lounged across the table. He waited to make his effect--Sir Arthur is a  born actor--and there is no doubt that he made it, when in his slowest,  most drawly tones he said quietly;    \"'With regard to this alleged murder of one William Kershaw, on  Wednesday, December the 10th, between 6.15 and 8.45 p.m., your Honour, I  now propose to call two witnesses, who saw this same William Kershaw  alive on Tuesday afternoon, December the 16th, that is to say, six days  after the supposed murder.'    \"It was as if a bombshell had exploded in the court. Even his Honour was  aghast, and I am sure the lady next to me only recovered from the shock  of the surprise in order to wonder whether she need put off her dinner  party after all.    \"As for me,\" added the man in the corner, with that strange mixture of  nervousness and self-complacency which had set Miss Polly Burton  wondering, \"well, you see, _I_ had made up my mind long ago where the  hitch lay in this particular case, and I was not so surprised as some of  the others.    \"Perhaps you remember the wonderful development of the case, which so  completely mystified the police--and in fact everybody except myself.  Torriani and a waiter at his hotel in the Commercial Road both deposed  that at about 3.30 p.m. on December the 10th a shabbily dressed  individual lolled into the coffee-room and ordered some tea. He was  pleasant enough and talkative, told the waiter that his name was William  Kershaw, that very soon all London would be talking about him, as he was  about, through an unexpected stroke of good fortune, to become a very  rich man, and so on, and so on, nonsense without end.    \"When he had finished his tea he lolled out again, but no sooner had he  disappeared down a turning of the road than the waiter discovered an old  umbrella, left behind accidentally by the shabby, talkative individual.  As is the custom in his highly respectable restaurant, Signor Torriani  put the umbrella carefully away in his office, on the chance of his  customer calling to claim it when he had discovered his loss. And sure  enough nearly a week later, on Tuesday, the 16th, at about 1 p.m., the  same shabbily dressed individual called and asked for his umbrella. He  had some lunch, and chatted once again to the waiter. Signor Torriani  and the waiter gave a description of William Kershaw, which coincided  exactly with that given by Mrs. Kershaw of her husband.    \"Oddly enough he seemed to be a very absent-minded sort of person, for  on this second occasion, no sooner had he left than the waiter found a  pocket-book in the coffee-room, underneath the table. It contained  sundry letters and bills, all addressed to William Kershaw. This  pocket-book was produced, and Karl Mueller, who had returned to the  court, easily identified it as having belonged to his dear and lamented  friend 'Villiam.'    \"This was the first blow to the case against the accused. It was a  pretty stiff one, you will admit. Already it had begun to collapse like  a house of cards. Still, there was the assignation, and the undisputed  meeting between Smethurst and Kershaw, and those two and a half hours of  a foggy evening to satisfactorily account for.\"    The man in the corner made a long pause, keeping the girl on  tenterhooks. He had fidgeted with his bit of string till there was not  an inch of it free from the most complicated and elaborate knots.    \"I assure you,\" he resumed at last, \"that at that very moment the whole  mystery was, to me, as clear as daylight. I only marvelled how his  Honour could waste his time and mine by putting what he thought were  searching questions to the accused relating to his past. Francis  Smethurst, who had quite shaken off his somnolence, spoke with a curious  nasal twang, and with an almost imperceptible soupcon of foreign accent,  He calmly denied Kershaw's version of his past; declared that he had  never been called Barker, and had certainly never been mixed up in any  murder case thirty years ago.    \"'But you knew this man Kershaw,' persisted his Honour, 'since you wrote  to him?'    \"'Pardon me, your Honour,' said the accused quietly, 'I have never, to  my knowledge, seen this man Kershaw, and I can swear that I never wrote  to him.'    \"'Never wrote to him?' retorted his Honour warningly. 'That is a strange  assertion to make when I have two of your letters to him in my hands at  the present moment.'    \"'I never wrote those letters, your Honour,' persisted the accused  quietly, 'they are not in my handwriting.'    \"'Which we can easily prove,' came in Sir Arthur Inglewood's drawly  tones, as he handed up a packet to his Honour; 'here are a number of  letters written by my client since he has landed in this country, and  some of which were"]]]
