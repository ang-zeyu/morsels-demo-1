Grecian brilliancy was  helpless against Roman strength of union.    [Footnote 12: See _First Battle between Greeks and Romans_, page 166.]    Then came the far more serious contest between Rome and Carthage.[13]  Carthage was a Phoenician, a Semite state; and hers was the last, the  most gigantic struggle made by Semitism to recover its waning  superiority, to dominate the ancient world. Three times in three  tremendous wars did she and Rome put forth their utmost strength against  each other. Hannibal, perhaps the greatest military genius who ever  lived, fought upon the side of Carthage. At one time Rome seemed  crushed, helpless before him.[14] Yet in the end Rome won.[15] It was  not by the brilliancy of her commanders, not by the superiority of her  resources. It was the grim, cool courage of the Aryan mind, showing  strongest and calmest when face to face with ruin.    [Footnote 13: See _The Punic Wars_, page 179.]    [Footnote 14: See _Battle of the Metaurus_, page 195.]    [Footnote 15: See _Scipio Africanus Crushes Hannibal at Zama and  Subjugates Carthage_, page 224.]    Our modern philosophers, being Aryan, assure us that the victory of  Carthage would have been an irretrievable disaster to mankind; that her  falsity, her narrow selfishness, her bloody inhumanity, would have  stifled all progress; that her dominion would have been the tyranny of a  few heartless masters over a world of tortured slaves. On the other  hand, Rome up to this point had certainly been a generous mistress to  her subjects. She had left them peace and prosperity among themselves;  she had given them as much political freedom as was consistent with her  sovereignty; she had wellnigh succeeded in welding all Italy into a  Roman nation. It is noteworthy that the large majority of the Italian  cities clung to her, even in the darkest straits to which she was  reduced by Hannibal.    Yet when the fall of her last great rival left Rome irresistible abroad,  her methods changed. It is hard to see how even Carthaginians could have  been more cruel, more grasping, more corrupt than the Roman rulers of  the provinces. Having conquered the governments of the world, Rome had  to face outbreak after outbreak from the unarmed, unsheltered masses of  the people. Her barbarity drove them to mad despair. \"Servile\" wars,  slave outbreaks are dotted over all the last century of the Roman  Republic.    The good, if there was any good, that Roman dominion brought the world  at that period was the spreading of Greek culture across the western  half of the world. As Rome mastered the Greek states one by one, their  genius won a subtler triumph over the conqueror. Her generals recognized  and admired a culture superior to their own. They carried off the  statues of Greece for the adornment of their villas, and with equal  eagerness they appropriated her manners and her thought, her literature  and her gods.    But this superficial culture could not save the Roman Republic from the  dry-rot that sapped her vitals from within. As a mere matter of numbers,  the actual citizens of Rome or even of the semi-Roman districts close  around her were too few to continue fighting over all the vast empire  they controlled. The sturdy peasant population of Italy slowly  disappeared. The actual inhabitants of the capital came to consist of a  few thousand vastly wealthy families, who held all the power, a few  thousand more of poorer citizens dependent on the rich, and then a vast  swarm of slaves and foreigners, feeders on the crumbs of the Roman  table.    In the battles against Carthage, the mass of Rome's armies had consisted  of her own citizens or of allies closely united to them in blood and  fortune. Her later victories were won by hired troops, men gathered from  every clime and every race. Roman generals still might lead them, Roman  laws environ them, Roman gold employ them. Yet the fact remained, that  in these armies lay the strength of the Republic, no longer within her  own walls, no longer in the stout hearts of her citizens.    Perhaps the world itself was slow in seeing this degeneration. The  Gracchi brothers tried to stem the tide, and they were slain, sacrificed  by the nation they sought to save.[16] Cornelius Sulla was the man who  completed, and at the same time made plain to all, the change that had  been growing up. Having bitter grievances against his enemies in the  capital, he appealed for redress, not to the Roman senate, not to the  votes of the populace, but to the swords of the legions he commanded.  Twice he marched his soldiers against Rome. He brushed aside the feeble  resistance that was offered, and entered the city like a conqueror. The  blood of those who had opposed his wishes flowed in streams. Three  thousand senators and knights, the flower of the Roman aristocracy, were  slain at his nod. Of the common folk and of the Italians throughout the  peninsula, the slaughter was immeasurable. And when his bloody vengeance  was at last glutted, Sulla ruled as an extravagant, conscienceless,  licentious dictator. Rome had found a fitting master.    [Footnote 16: See _The Gracchi and Their Reforms_, page 259.]    THE STRUGGLE OF INDIVIDUALS FOR SUPREMACY    The Roman people, the mighty race who had defied a Hannibal at their  gates, were clearly come to an end. Sulla had proved the power of the  Republic to be an empty shell. After his death, men used the empty forms  awhile; but the surviving aristocrats had learned their awful lesson.  They put no further faith in the strength of the city; they watched the  armies and the generals; they intrigued for the various commands. It was  an exciting game. Life and fortune were the stakes they risked; the  prize--the mastery of a helpless world, waiting to be plundered.    Pompey and Caesar proved the ablest players. Pompey overthrew what was  left of the Greek Asiatic kingdoms and returned to Rome the idol of his  troops, wellnigh as powerful as had been Sulla. Caesar, looking in his  turn for a place to build up an army devoted to himself, selected Gaul  and spent eight years in subduing and civilizing what was in a way the  most important of all Rome's conquests. In Gaul he came in contact with  another, fresher Aryan race.[17] Rome received new soldiers for her  legions, new brains fitted to understand and carry on the work of  civilizing the world.    [Footnote 17: See _Caesar Conquers Gaul_, page 267.]    When Caesar, turning away from Britain,[18] marched these new-formed  legions back against Rome, even as Sulla had done, it was almost like  another Gallic invasion of the South. Pompey fled. He gathered his  legions from Asia; and the world resounded once more to the clash of  arms.    [Footnote 18: See _Roman Invasion and Conquest of Britain_, page 285.]    This, then, was the third and final stage of the huge struggle for  empire. War was still the business of the world. Rome had first defeated  foreign nations; then she had to defeat the uprisings of the subject  peoples; now her chiefs, finding her exhausted, fought among themselves  for the supreme power. Armies of Asiatics, armies of Gauls, each  claiming to represent Rome, battled over her helpless body.    Caesar was victorious. But when the conquering power which had once  belonged to the united nation became embodied in a single man, there was  a new way by which it might be checked. The government of Rome, like  that of the Greek and Asiatic tyrannies, became a \"despotism tempered by  assassination\"; and Caesar was its foremost victim.[19]    [Footnote 19: See _Assassination of Caesar_, page 313.]    His death did not stop the fascinating gamble for empire. It only added  one more move to the possible complexities of the game. The lesser  players had their chance. They intrigued and they fought. Egypt, the  last remaining civilized state outside of Rome, was drawn into the  whirlpool also.[20] Cleopatra and Antony acted their reckless parts, and  at length out of the world-wide tumult emerged \"young Octavius,\" to  assume his _role_ as \"Augustus Caesar,\" acknowledged emperor of the  world.[21]    [Footnote 20: See _Cleopatra's Conquest of Caesar and Antony_, page  295.]    [Footnote 21: See _Rome Becomes a Monarchy_, page 333.]    Note, however, that the term \"world\" is still one of boast, not truth.  Emperor over many men, Augustus was; but the powers of nature still shut  many races safe beyond his mastery. The ocean bounded his dominion on  the west; the deserts to the south and east; the German forests to the  north. These last he did essay to conquer, but they proved beyond him.  The wild German tribes having no cities, which they must defend at any  cost, could afford to flee or hide. Choosing their own time and place  they rose suddenly, smote the legions of Augustus, and melted into the  wilderness again.[22]    [Footnote 22: See _Germans Under Arminius Revolt against Rome_, page  362.]    Rome was checked at last. No civilized nation had been able to stand  against her; but the wild tribes of the Germans and the Parthians did.  Barbarism had still by far the larger portion of the world wherein to  live and develop, and gather brain and brawn. Rome could not conquer the  wilderness.
