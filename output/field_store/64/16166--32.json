At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike  another; and at the same moment a knock, so quiet and stealthy as to be  scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.    The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage.  He stood  motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated.  Then he  turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him.  A third knock sounded through the house.    \"What's that?\"  cried the old woman, starting up.    \"A rat,\" said the old man in shaking tones--\"a rat.  It passed me on the  stairs.\"    His wife sat up in bed listening.  A loud knock resounded through the  house.    \"It's Herbert!\"  she screamed.  \"It's Herbert!\"    She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by  the arm, held her tightly.    \"What are you going to do?\"  he whispered hoarsely.    \"It's my boy; it's Herbert!\"  she cried, struggling mechanically.  \"I forgot it was two miles away.  What are you holding me for?  Let go.  I must open the door.\"    \"For God's sake don't let it in,\" cried the old man, trembling.    \"You're afraid of your own son,\" she cried, struggling.  \"Let me go.  I'm  coming, Herbert; I'm coming.\"    There was another knock, and another.  The old woman with a sudden wrench  broke free and ran from the room.  Her husband followed to the landing,  and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs.  He heard the  chain rattle back and the bottom bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the  socket.  Then the old woman's voice, strained and panting.    \"The bolt,\" she cried, loudly.  \"Come down.  I can't reach it.\"    But her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in  search of the paw.  If he could only find it before the thing outside got  in.  A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house, and he  heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage  against the door.  He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly  back, and at the same moment he found the monkey's paw, and frantically  breathed his third and last wish.    The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the  house.  He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened.  A cold wind  rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and  misery from his wife gave him courage to run down to her side, and then  to the gate beyond.  The street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet  and deserted road."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1216"],[0,"Reflections on the Decline of Science in England, and on Some of Its Causes (#3)"],[1,",  must be left to the historian. It is not within the province of one who,  having mixed sufficiently with scientific society in England to see  and regret the weakness of some of its greatest ornaments, and to see  through and deplore the conduct of its pretended friends, offers these  remarks, with the hope that they may excite discussion,--with the  conviction that discussion is the firmest ally of truth,--and with the  confidence that nothing but the full expression of public opinion can  remove the evils that chill the enthusiasm, and cramp the energies of  the science of England.    The causes which have produced, and some of the effects which have  resulted from, the present state of science in England, are so mixed,  that it is difficult to distinguish accurately between them. I shall,  therefore, in this volume, not attempt any minute discrimination,  but rather present the result of my reflections on the concomitant  circumstances which have attended the decay, and at the conclusion of  it, shall examine some of the suggestions which have been offered for  the advancement of British science.        CHAPTER I. ON THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE OF SCIENCE AND EDUCATION.    That the state of knowledge in any country will exert a directive  influence on the general system of instruction adopted in it, is a  principle too obvious to require investigation. And it is equally  certain that the tastes and pursuits of our manhood will bear on them  the traces of the earlier impressions of our education. It is therefore  not unreasonable to suppose that some portion of the neglect of science  in England, may be attributed to the system of education we pursue. A  young man passes from our public schools to the universities, ignorant  almost of the elements of every branch of useful knowledge; and at these  latter establishments, formed originally for instructing those who  are intended for the clerical profession, classical and mathematical  pursuits are nearly the sole objects proposed to the student's ambition.    Much has been done at one of our universities during the last fifteen  years, to improve the system of study; and I am confident that there  is no one connected with that body, who will not do me the justice to  believe that, whatever suggestions I may venture to offer, are prompted  by the warmest feelings for the honour and the increasing prosperity of  its institutions. The ties which connect me with Cambridge are indeed of  no ordinary kind.    Taking it then for granted that our system of academical education ought  to be adapted to nearly the whole of the aristocracy of the country, I  am inclined to believe that whilst the modifications I should propose  would not be great innovations on the spirit of our institutions, they  would contribute materially to that important object.    It will be readily admitted, that a degree conferred by an university,  ought to be a pledge to the public that he who holds it possesses a  certain quantity of knowledge. The progress of society has rendered  knowledge far more various in its kinds than it used to be; and to meet  this variety in the tastes and inclinations of those who come to us for  instruction, we have, besides the regular lectures to which all must  attend, other sources of information from whence the students may  acquire sound and varied knowledge in the numerous lectures on  chemistry, geology, botany, history, &c. It is at present a matter of  option with the student, which, and how many of these courses he shall  attend, and such it should still remain. All that it would be necessary  to add would be, that previously to taking his degree, each person  should be examined by those Professors, whose lectures he had attended.  The pupils should then be arranged in two classes, according to their  merits, and the names included in these classes should be printed. I  would then propose that no young man, except his name was found amongst  the \"List of Honours,\" should be allowed to take his degree, unless he  had been placed in the first class of some one at least of the courses  given by the professors. But it should still be imperative upon the  student to possess such mathematical knowledge as we usually require. If  he had attained the first rank in several of these examinations, it  is obvious that we should run no hazard in a little relaxing the  strictness of his mathematical trial.    If it should be thought preferable, the sciences might be grouped, and  the following subjects be taken together:--         Modern History.       Laws of England.       Civil Law.         Political Economy.       Applications of Science to Arts and Manufactures.         Chemistry.       Mineralogy.       Geology.         Zoology, including Physiology and Comparative Anatomy.       Botany, including Vegetable Physiology and Anatomy.    One of the great advantages of such a system would be, that no young  person would have an excuse for not studying, by stating, as is most  frequently done, that the only pursuits followed at Cambridge, classics  and mathematics, are not adapted either to his taste, or to the wants of  his after life. His friends and relatives would then reasonably expect  every student to have acquired distinction in SOME pursuit. If it should  be feared that this plan would lead to too great a diversity of pursuits  in the same individual, a limitation might be placed upon the number of  examinations into which the same person might be permitted to enter. It  might also be desirable not to restrict the whole of these examinations  to the third year, but to allow the student to enter on some portion of  them in the first or second year, if he should prefer it.    By such an arrangement, which would scarcely interfere seriously with  our other examinations, we should, I think, be enabled effectually to  keep pace with the wants of society, and retaining fully our power  and our right to direct the studies of those who are intended for the  church, as well as of those who aspire to the various offices connected  with our academical institutions; we should, at the same time, open  a field of honourable ambition to multitudes, who, from the exclusive  nature of our present studies, leave us with but a very limited addition  to their stock of knowledge.    Much more might be said on a subject so important to the interests of  the country, as well as of our university, but my wish is merely to open  it for our own consideration and discussion. We have already done so  much for the improvement of our system of instruction, that public  opinion will not reproach us for any unwillingness to alter. It is our  first duty to be well satisfied that we can improve: such alterations  ought only to be the result of a most mature consideration, and of a  free interchange of sentiments on the subject, in order that we may  condense upon the question the accumulated judgment of many minds.    It is in some measure to be attributed to the defects of our system of  education, that scientific knowledge scarcely exists amongst the  higher classes of society. The discussions in the Houses of Lords or of  Commons, which arise on the occurrence of any subjects connected with  science, sufficiently prove this fact, which, if I had consulted the  extremely limited nature of my personal experience, I should, perhaps,  have doubted.        CHAPTER II. OF THE INDUCEMENTS TO INDIVIDUALS TO CULTIVATE SCIENCE.    Interest or inclination form the primary and ruling motives in this  matter: and both these exert greater or less proportionate influence in  each of the respective cases to be examined.          SECTION 1. PROFESSIONAL IMPULSES.    A large portion of those who are impelled by ambition or necessity to  advance themselves in the world, make choice of some profession in which  they imagine their talents likely to be rewarded with success; and there  are peculiar advantages resulting to each from this classification of  society into professions. The ESPRIT DE CORPS frequently overpowers the  jealousy which exists between individuals, and pushes on to advantageous  situations some of the more fortunate of the profession; whilst, on the  other hand, any injury or insult offered to the weakest, is redressed or  resented by the whole body. There are other advantages which are perhaps  of more importance to the public. The numbers which compose the learned  professions in England are so considerable, that a kind of public  opinion is generated amongst them, which powerfully tends to repress  conduct that is injurious either to the profession or to the public.  Again, the mutual jealousy and rivalry excited amongst the whole body  is so considerable, that although the rank and estimation which an  individual holds in the profession may be most unfairly appreciated,  by taking the opinion of his rival; yet few estimations will be found  generally more correct than the opinion of a whole profession on the  merits of any one of its body. This test is of great value to the  public, and becomes the more so, in proportion to the difficulty of the  study to which the profession is devoted. It is by availing themselves  of it that men of sense and judgment, who have occasion for the services  of professional persons, are, in a great measure, guided in their  choice.    The pursuit of science does not, in England, constitute a distinct  profession, as it does in many other countries. It is therefore, on  that ground alone, deprived of many of the advantages which attach  to professions. One of its greatest misfortunes arises from this  circumstance; for the subjects on which it is conversant are so  difficult, and require such unremitted devotion of time, that few who  have not spent years in their study can judge of the relative knowledge  of those who pursue them. It follows, therefore, that the public, and  even that men of sound sense and discernment, can scarcely find means  to"]]]
