Moreover,  by establishing himself as a sort of miracle worker (for so the cure was  regarded), it would be understood that curiosity was not the basis for the  investigation into the domestic life of the patient and her husband, but  that a desire to do more good inspired it.    The physician started his investigation with the statement that he knew from  past experience that some conflict was going on between husband and wife;  that there was some source of irritation which caused these outbursts of  symptoms on the part of the patient, and that unless they told him what was  behind the matter his help would be limited to the relief of the present  symptoms. It was firmly stated that any denial of such discord would not be  believed, and that only a complete confidence would be helpful.    The patient, who had been listening to this statement with lowered eyes and  nervously intertwining fingers, then burst out as follows: There WAS trouble  between them and there always would be until it was settled right,--this  with much emphasis and emotional manifestation. So long as he insisted on  living where they did, just so long would she quarrel with him.  She did not  like the neighbors, especially the woman downstairs, she did not like the  room, she did not like anything about the place or the neighborhood, hated  the very sight of it and would never cease attempting to move from there. It  came out on further questioning that the woman downstairs, whom the patient  particularly disliked, was a storm center in that the wife was jealous of  her, although she adduced no very good reasons for her attitude.  Moreover,  the patient stated that she wished to move to a district where she had  friends, though other sources of information showed that these friends were  of a rather unsavory character. Her husband was absolutely determined not to  move from his house. He stated that he would rather have her go away and  stay away than move from there; that the rent was too high in the place  where she wanted to move, and that the rent was suitable where they were.  Moreover, for his part, he hated his wife's desired neighborhood and would  never consent to changing his residence from the present place to the other.  It came out that her fainting and vomiting spells and headaches usually  followed bitter quarrels, and on other matters these symptoms usually placed  the victory on her side. On this particular point, however, her husband had  remained obdurate. It was shown that the present attack of paralysis and  aphonia, symptoms of an unusually severe character, followed an unusually  bitter quarrel which had lasted for a whole day and into the night of the  attack.    The question arises at this point, \"Why did this attack take the form of a  paralysis?\"  At first this seemed unaccountable, but later it was found that  the old woman for whom the patient had been caring had a \"stroke\" with loss  of the power to speak, though no aphonia. The patient had gone to work as a  sort of nurse for the old woman under protest, for she did not wish to do  anything outside of her own light housekeeping, although the added income  was sorely needed since work was slack in her husband's place of employment.  The pain in her side caused her to quit work as nurse, much to her husband's  dissatisfaction until she convinced him that her pain and disability were  marked. It was evident that despite the controversies and quarrels that  prevailed in the household, her husband sincerely loved her, for he stayed  away from his work during the three weeks of her illness to act as her  nurse. Moreover, he spent his earnings quite freely in consulting various  physicians in order to cure her.    It was shown from what both the patient and her husband said, and from the  whole history of their marital life, that she had used as a weapon, though  not with definite conscious purpose, for the gaining of her point in  whatever quarrel came up, symptoms that are usually called hysterical; that  is to say, vomiting, fainting spells and pains without definite physical  cause. This method usually assured her victory by playing upon her husband's  alarm and concern as well as by causing him intense dissatisfaction. With  the advent of a disagreement which could not be settled her way by her usual  symptoms, there followed, not by any means through her volition or conscious  purpose, more severe symptoms; namely, spastic paralysis and aphonia, which,  in a general way, were suggested by her patient. There seems to have been,  and there undoubtedly was, a sexual element entering into this last quarrel;  namely, that she was jealous of the woman who lived downstairs, though  without any proof of her husband's infidelity.    Both patient and her husband finally agreed to the physician's statement  that the symptoms were directly referable to the quarrels, although both  claimed that it had never occurred to them before, a fact made evident by  their questions and objections. No psychoanalysis was possible in this case,  for the man and woman belong to that class of people who feel that they are  cured when their symptoms are relieved.  It may be argued, without any  possibility of contradiction, that a psychoanalysis would have revealed a  deeper reaching mechanism and that a closer relationship and connection  between the paralysis and other symptoms with the past sexual experiences of  the patient could have been established. This last claim may be doubted,  however, for there is always a gap between the alleged \"conversion\" of  mental states into physical symptoms, and this gap can in no case be bridged  over even by Freud's own accounts. The conversion always remains as a mere  statement and is a logical connection between the appearance of physical  symptoms and the so-called conflicts; in other words, it is an explanation  and not a FACT.  Compared with the complex Freudian mechanism, with its  repressions, compressions, censors, dreams, etc., the conception of  hysterical symptoms as a marital weapon as comparable with the tears of more  normal women seems very simple and probably too simple. In fact, it does not  explain the hysteria, it merely gives a USE for its symptoms, and the writer  is driven back to the statement that the neuropathic person is characterized  by his or her bizarre and prolonged emotional reactions, which, in turn,  brings us back to a defect ab origine.  And the Freudians, starting out to  prove that the experiences of the individual ALONE cause hysteria, by  pushing back the TIME of those experiences to INFANCY (and lately to foetal  life), have proved the contrary, that is, the inborn nature of the disease.        THE ANALYSIS OF A NIGHTMARE    BY RAYMOND BELLAMY    Professor of Education, Emory and Henry College, Emory, Va.    A FEW nights ago I experienced a very interesting nightmare, and,  immediately on awakening, I got up and recorded it, analyzing it as fully as  I was able.  This is the first nightmare I have had for several years, and I  never was especially addicted to them. Two years ago I made an introductory  study of dreams,[1] and at that time dreamed profusely, but recently I have  been dreaming very rarely, and when I do dream the experiences are not at  all vivid. I use the term \"nightmare\" in a somewhat popular sense to mean a  painful or frightful dream accompanied by physical disturbances, such as  heart flutter and disturbances of breathing, and followed on awakening by a  certain amount of the painful emotion which was a part of the dream.  Accepting this definition, the experience which I have to relate was a  typical nightmare.  A few words of explanation are necessary to give the  proper setting for the experience. At present I am teaching in the summer  school at this place and my wife is visiting her folks; during her absence,  in order to keep from getting too lonesome, I invited one of the young men  in the summer school to come and room with me and keep me company. With this  as an explanation, I shall copy the original account of the dream as nearly  as possible, making a few corrections of the barbarous language I used in  the half-asleep state.    [1] At Clark University, 1912-1913.    On the night of August 9, 1914, I went to bed at 11.40 o'clock and was soon  asleep.  About 3.40 in the morning, the young man, F. K. S., roused me and I  awoke weak, scared, and with a fluttering heart; he said I had been making a  distressing sort of noise, but he could not distinguish any words.  Immediately, I judged that the dream was caused by my lying on my back, and  in an uncomfortable position. As a rule I do not sleep on my back, but for  some reason I had gone to sleep that way this time.  Also, it had been  raining when I went to bed, and I had put the windows down, and the  ventilation was bad.    The dream, as nearly as it was remembered, was as follows: I was with  somebody in a buggy and we drove down a hill, across a little stream, and up  the other hill, where we arrived at our destination. I seemed to find  trouble in getting a place to hitch, and I had to take the horse out of the  buggy and I think take the harness off. I distinctly remember that in the  dream this was a hardship to me, as it would have been in waking life, for I  am not a good hand with horses, and do not like to work with them. All this  is very hazy to me, and I do not know with whom I was driving, but think it  was a lady, possibly my wife. There were other people at this place and  other horses and buggies. (Could it be called a case of reversion to  childhood, in that there were only horses and buggies and no automobiles?)  There is a break in the dream here, and we were within some kind of a  building where there was a crowd of people.  As it seems now, we were around  some kind of a rotunda, but this is very vague. The important part seems to  be that there were two people, a man and a woman,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12261"],[0,"Balder the Beautiful, Volume I.
