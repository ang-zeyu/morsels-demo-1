It is certain, however, that shortly after the committal it became  known that much new evidence was to be forthcoming at the trial; that  the case against the prisoner would be found even blacker than before;  and that the witnesses were so many in number, and their testimony so  entirely circumstantial, that the proceedings were expected to occupy a  week.    Sure enough, the case was accorded first place in the November Sessions,  with a fair start on a Monday morning toward the latter end of the  month. In the purlieus of the mean, historic court, it was a morning not  to be forgotten, and only to be compared with those which followed  throughout the week. The prisoner's sex, her youth, her high bearing,  and the peculiar isolation of her position, without a friend to stand by  her in her need, all appealed to the popular imagination, and produced a  fascination which was only intensified by the equally general feeling  that no one else could have committed the crime. From the judge  downward, all connected with the case were pestered for days beforehand  with more or less unwarrantable applications for admission. And when the  time came, the successful suppliant had to elbow every yard of his way  from Newgate Street or Ludgate Hill; to pass three separate barriers  held by a suspicious constabulary; to obtain the good offices of the  Under Sheriff, through those of his liveried lackeys; and finally to  occupy the least space, on the narrowest of seats, in a varnished stall  filled with curiously familiar faces, within a few feet of the heavily  veiled prisoner in the dock, and not many more from the red-robed judge  upon the bench.    The first to take all this trouble on the Monday morning, and the last  to escape from the foul air (shot by biting draughts) when the court  adjourned, was a white-headed gentleman of striking appearance and  stamina to match; for, undeterred by the experience, he was in like  manner first and last upon each subsequent day. Behind him came and went  the well-known faces, the authors and the actors with a  semi-professional interest in the case; but they were not well known to  the gentleman with the white head. He heard no more than he could help  of their constant whisperings, and, if he knew not at whom he more than  once had occasion to turn and frown, he certainly did not look the man  to care. He had a well-preserved reddish face, with a small mouth of  extraordinary strength, a canine jaw, and singularly noble forehead; but  his most obvious distinction was his full head of snowy hair. The only  hair upon his face, a pair of bushy eyebrows, was so much darker as to  suggest a dye; but the eyes themselves were black as midnight, with a  glint of midnight stars, and of such a subtle inscrutability that a  certain sweetness of expression came only as the last surprise in a face  full of contrast and contradiction.    No one in court had ever seen this man before; no one but the Under  Sheriff learnt his name during the week; but by the third day his  identity was a subject of discussion, both by the professional students  of the human countenance, who sat behind him (balked of their study by  the prisoner's veil), and among the various functionaries who had  already found him as free with a sovereign as most gentlemen are with a  piece of silver. So every day he was ushered with ceremony to the same  place, at the inner end of the lowest row; there he would sit watching  the prisoner, a trifle nearer her than those beside or behind him; and  only once was his attentive serenity broken for an instant by a change  of expression due to any development of the case.    It was not when the prisoner pleaded clearly through her veil, in the  first breathless minutes of all; it was not a little later, when the  urbane counsel for the prosecution, wagging his pince-nez at the jury,  thrilled every other hearer with a mellifluous forecast of the new  evidence to be laid before them. The missing watch and chain had been  found; they would presently be produced, and the jury would have an  opportunity of examining them, together with a plan of the chimney of  the room in which the murder had been committed; for it was there that  they had been discovered upon a second search instituted since the  proceedings before the magistrates. The effect of this announcement may  be conceived; it was the sensation of the opening day. The whole case of  the prosecution rested on the assumption that there had been, on the  part of some inmate of the house, who alone (it was held) could have  committed the murder, a deliberate attempt to give it the appearance of  the work of thieves. Thus far this theory rested on the bare facts that  the glass of the broken window had been found outside, instead of  within; that no other mark of foot or hand had been made or left by the  supposititious burglars; whereas a brace of revolvers had been  discovered in the dead man's bureau, both loaded with such bullets as  the one which had caused his death, while one of them had clearly been  discharged since the last cleaning. The discovery of the missing watch  and chain, in the very chimney of the same room, was a piece of ideal  evidence of the confirmatory kind. But it was not the point that made an  impression on the man with the white hair; it did not increase his  attention, for that would have been impossible; he was perhaps the one  spectator who was not, if only for the moment, perceptibly thrilled.    Thrilling also was the earlier evidence, furnished by maid-servants and  police constables in pairs; but here there was no surprise. The maids  were examined not only as to what they had seen and heard on the night  of the murder--and they seemed to have heard everything except the fatal  shot--but upon the previous relations of their master and mistress--of  which they showed an equally extensive knowledge. The constables were  perforce confined to their own discoveries and observations when the  maids had called them in. But all four witnesses spoke to the prisoner's  behavior when shown the dead body of her husband, and there was the  utmost unanimity in their several tales. The prisoner had exhibited  little or no surprise; it was several minutes before she had uttered a  syllable; and then her first words had been to point out that burglars  alone could have committed the murder.    In cross-examination the senior counsel for the defence thus early  showed his hand; and it was not a strong one to those who knew the game.  A Queen's Counsel, like the leader for the Crown, this was an  altogether different type of lawyer; a younger man, with a more engaging  manner; a more brilliant man, who sought with doubtful wisdom to blind  the jury with his brilliance. His method was no innovation at the Old  Bailey; it was to hold up every witness in turn to the derision and  contempt of the jury and the court. So both the maids were reduced to  tears, and each policeman cleverly insulted as such. But the testimony  of all four remained unshaken; and the judge himself soothed the young  women's feelings with a fatherly word, while wigs were shaken in the  well of the court. That was no road to the soft side of a decent,  conscientious, hard-headed jury, of much the same class as these  witnesses themselves; even the actors and authors had a sound opinion on  the point, without waiting to hear one from the professional gentlemen  in the well. But the man in front with the very white hair--the man who  was always watching the prisoner at the bar--there was about as much  expression of opinion upon his firm, bare face as might be seen through  the sable thickness of her widow's veil.    It was the same next day, when, for some five hours out of a possible  five and a half, the attention of the court was concentrated upon a  point of obviously secondary significance. It was suggested by the  defence that the watch and chain found up the study chimney were not  those worn by the deceased at the time he met his death. The contention  was supported by photographs of Alexander Minchin wearing a watch-chain  that might or might not be of another pattern altogether; expert  opinions were divided on the point; and experts in chains as well as in  photography were eventually called by both sides. Interesting in the  beginning, the point was raised and raised again, and on subsequent  days, until all were weary of the sight of the huge photographic  enlargements, which were handed about the court upon each occasion. Even  the prisoner would droop in her chair when the \"chain photograph\" was  demanded for the twentieth time by her own unflagging counsel; even the  judge became all but inattentive on the point, before it was finally  dropped on an intimation from the jury that they had made up their minds  about the chains; but no trace of boredom had crossed the keen, alert  face of the unknown gentleman with the snowy hair.    So the case was fought for Mrs. Minchin, tooth and nail indeed, yet  perhaps with more asperity than conviction, and certainly at times upon  points which were hardly worth the fighting. Yet, on the Friday  afternoon, when her counsel at last played his masterstroke, and,  taking advantage of the then new Act, put the prisoner herself in the  witness-box, it was done with the air of a man who is throwing up his  case. The truth could be seen at a glance at the clean-cut, handsome,  but too expressive profile of the crushing cross-examiner of female  witnesses and insolent foe to the police. As it had been possible to  predict, from the mere look with which he had risen to his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12595"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 10, No. 272, (#3)"],[1,"along the luxuriant shores  of the Mediterranean, or surrounded by ice-bergs in the Polar sea,--one  thought, one feeling possessed my soul, and that was devoted to the  being I adored. Years rolled away; but that deep, strong, deathless  passion distance could not subdue, nor old age founder. 'Tis now about  seven years since the British troops under Wellington were landed on the  Continent. I was employed with a party of seamen on shore in  transporting the artillery and erecting batteries. A body of the French  attacked one of our detachments, and, after considerable slaughter on  both sides, the enemy were compelled to retreat. We were ordered to the  field to bring in the wounded and prisoners. Never--never shall I forget  that day: the remembrance even now unmans me. Oh, lady! forgive these  tears, and pity the anguish of an old man's heart. Day had just began to  dawn when we arrived upon the plain, and commenced our search among the  bodies, to see if there were any who yet remained lingering in  existence. Passing by and over heaps of dead, my progress was suddenly  arrested, and every fibre of my heart was racked, on seeing a female  sitting by the mangled remains of an English soldier. She was crouched  upon the ground, her face resting on her lap, and every feature hid from  view. Her long black hair hung in dishevelled flakes about her  shoulders, and her garments closed round her person, heavy with the cold  night-rains; one hand clasped that of the dead soldier, the other arm  was thrown around his head. Every feeling of my soul was roused to  exertion--I approached--she raised herself up, and--and--great Heaven!  'twas she--the woman whom I loved! She gazed with sickly horror; and,  though greatly altered--though time and sorrow had chased away the bloom  of health--though scarce a trace of former beauty remained, those  features were too deeply engraven on my memory for me to be mistaken;  but she knew me not. I forgot all my wrongs, and rushing forward,  clasped her to my breast. Oh, what a moment was that! she made an  ineffectual struggle for release, and then fainted in my arms. Some of  my shipmates came to the spot, and, turning over the lifeless form  before us, my eyes rested on the countenance of him who had once been  nay friend. But death disarms resentment; he was beyond my vengeance,  and had already been summoned to the tribunal of the Most High. When I  had last seen them, affluence, prosperity, and happiness, were the  portion of us all. Now--but I cannot, cannot repeat the distressing  tale; let it suffice, lady, that she was carried to a place of safety,  and every effort used to restore animation, in which we were eventually  successful. How shall I describe our meeting, when she recognised me?--it  is impossible; I feel it now in every nerve, but to tell you is beyond  my power. Through the kindness of a generous officer, I procured her a  passage to England, and gave her all that I possessed, with this one  request, that she would remain at Plymouth till my return to port. In  a few months afterwards we anchored in the Sound, and, as soon as duty  would permit, I hastened to obtain leave to go on shore; it was denied  me--yes, cruelly denied me. Stung to madness, I did not hesitate; but as  soon as night had closed in, slipped down the cables and swam to land.  With eager expectation I hurried to the house in which I had requested  her to remain. I crossed the threshold unobserved, for all was silent  as the grave, and gently ascended the stairs. The room door was partly  open, and a faint light glimmered on the table. The curtains of the  bed were undrawn, and there--there lay gasping in the last convulsive  agonies of nature--Oh, lady! she was dying--I rushed into the room,  threw myself by her side, and implored her to live for me. She knew  me--yes, she knew me--but at that very instant an officer with an armed  party entered the apartment. They had watched me, and I was arrested as  a deserter--arrested did I say? Ay! but not till I had stretched one of  the insulting rascals at my feet. I was handcuffed, and bayonets were  pointed at my breast. Vain was every entreaty for one hour, only one  hour. The dying woman raised herself upon her pillow--she stretched  forth her hand to mine, manacled as they were--she fell back, and  Emma--yes, my Emma was no more. Despair, rage, fury, worked up the  fiends within my soul! I struggled to burst my fetters, dashed them at  all who approached me; but overcome at length, was borne to the common  gaol. I was tried for desertion, and, on account of my resistance, was  flogged through the fleet. I had acted improperly as a seaman, but I had  done my duty as a man. It was not my intention to desert my ship, but my  feelings overpowered me, and I obeyed their dictates. Yet now I felt  indignant at my punishment, and took the first opportunity to escape;  but whither could I go?--there was no protection for me. One visit, one  lonely visit was paid to the grave of her who was now at rest for ever;  and I again entered on board the ----, bound to the West India station.  I fought in several actions, and lost my arm. But the R* for desertion  was still against my name, and though I obtained a pension for my wound,  I could obtain none for servitude. I cannot apply to the friends of my  youth, for they believe me dead; and who would credit the assertions of  a broken-hearted sailor?--No, no: a few-short months, and the voyage of  life will be over; then will old Will Jennings be laid in peace by the  side of Emma Wentworth, and wait for the last great muster before Him  who searches all hearts, and rewards those seamen who have done their  duty.\" Here he ceased, while D---- turned to his wife, whose loud sobs  gave witness to the sympathy of her heart; but the agony increased to  hysteric convulsions--she sprang hastily on her feet--shrieked, \"'Tis  he! 'tis William! 'tis my uncle!\" and fell upon his neck!--_Literary  Magnet_.

Oh! poverty, thou tyrant of the mind,    How eager would I shun thy cold embrace,    And try some hospitable shore to find!    Some welcome refuge; some more happy place.      But ah! the stars shone adverse at my birth,    Tho' boyish pleasures all my youth beguil'd,    And little thought amidst those scenes of mirth,    That I was doom'd to be misfortune's child.      At last the haggard wretch is come; and I,    Like some poor hark, toss'd by the mighty wave,    Am solitary left, nor have wherewith to fly    Her dread embrace, save to man's friend--the grave.      No hope, alas! possesses now my mind,    Plung'd in the deepest gulf of penury;    No earthly friend, to pity none inclined;    To soothe the bitter pang of misery.      'Tis hope that raises us to heaven,    While pure affection breathes no other love,    And makes to those to whom it's given    A something like a paradise above.      Alas! for me no earthly paradise awaits;    No true affection nor no friendly tear;    Spurn'd at by _friends_, and scorned at by the _great_;    And all that poverty can bring is here.      Then hail thou grateful visitant, oh death,    And stop the troubled ocean of my breast:    Lull the rude waves; nor let my parting breath    E'er cause a sigh, or break one moment's rest.      Then when my clay-cold form shall bid adieu,    Hid in its parent's bosom, kindred earth,    Let not the errors e'er appear in view,    But turn from them, and only speak his worth.

Actors are rather generally esteemed to be what is commonly called \"good  company.\" For our part, we think the companionable qualities of the  members of the _corps dramatique_ are much overrated. There are  many of them, we know full well, as pleasant and agreeable spirits as  any extant; but the great mass of actors are too outrageously  professional to please. Their conversation is too much tainted with  theatricals--they do not travel off the stage in their discourse--their  gossip smacks of the green-room--their jests and good things are, for  the most part, extracts from plays--they lack originality--the drama is  their world, and they think nothing worthy of argument but men and  matters connected with it. They are the weakest of all critics, their  observations on characters in plays are hereditary opinions of the  corps, which descend as heir looms with the part to its successive  representatives. There are, doubtless, some splendid exceptions--we  could name several performers, who talk finely on general subjects, who  are not confined to the foot-lights in their fancies, who utter jests of  the first water, whose sayings are worth hearing, and whose anecdotes  are made up of such good materials, and are so well told withal, that  our \"lungs have crowed like chanticleer\" to hear them. Others, we have  met with, who are the antipodes of those drama-doating gentlemen whom  we have noticed above, who rarely, unless purposely inveigled into it,  mention the stage or those who tread it. One highly gifted individual,  when alive, enjoyed a discourse on the merits of Molyneux, the small  talk of the P.C., or a vivid description of an old-school fight;  another has a keen relish for all matters connected with the Great  St. Ledger--the state of the odds against the outside fillies for the  Oaks--the report of those deep versed in veterinary lore, upon the  cough of the favourite for the Derby; you cannot please a certain  excellent melo-dramatic actor better than by placing him alongside of  an enthusiastic young sailor, who will talk with him about maintops  and mizens--sky-scrapers"]]]
