Fletcher, _The Purple Island_, ix. (1633).    ACRAS'IA, Intemperance personified. Spenser says she is an enchantress  living in the \"Bower of Bliss,\" in \"Wandering Island.\" She had the  power of transforming her lovers into monstrous shapes; but sir Guyon  (_temperance_), having caught her in a net and bound her, broke down  her bower and burnt it to ashes.--_Faery Queen_, ii. 12 (1590).    ACRA'TES (3 _syl_.), Incontinence personified in _The Purple Island_,  by Phineas Fletcher. He had two sons (twins) by Caro, viz., Methos  (_drunkenness_) and Gluttony, both fully described in canto vii.  (Greek, _akrates_, \"incontinent.\")    _Acra'tes_ (3 _syl_.), Incontinence personified in _The Faery Queen_,  by Spenser. He is the father of Cymoch'les and Pyroch'les.--Bk. ii. 4  (1590).    ACRES (_Bob_), a country gentleman, the rival of ensign Beverley,  _alias_ captain Absolute, for the hand and heart of Lydia Languish,  the heiress. He tries to ape the man of fashion, gets himself up as a  loud swell, and uses \"sentimental oaths,\" _i. e_. oaths bearing on  the subject. Thus if duels are spoken of he says, _ods triggers and  flints_; if clothes, _ods frogs and tambours_; if music, _ods minnums_  [minims] _and crotchets_; if ladies, _ods blushes and blooms_. This  he learnt from a militia officer, who told him the ancients swore by  Jove, Bacchus, Mars, Venus, Minerva, etc., according to the sentiment.  Bob Acres is a great blusterer, and talks big of his daring, but when  put to the push \"his courage always oozed out of his fingers' ends.\"  J. Quick was the original Bob Acres.--Sheridan, _The Rivals_ (1775).      As thro' his palms _Bob Acres_' valor oozed,    So Juan's virtue ebbed, I know not how.    Byron, _Don Juan_.    Joseph Jefferson's impersonation of Bob Acres is inimitable for  fidelity to the spirit of the original, and informed throughout with  exquisite humor that never degenerates into coarseness.    ACRIS'IUS, father of Dan'ae. An oracle declared that Danae would give  birth to a son who would kill him, so Acrisius kept his daughter shut  up in an apartment under ground, or (as some say) in a brazen tower.  Here she became the mother of Per'seus (2 _syl_.), by Jupiter in the  form of a shower of gold. The king of Argos now ordered his daughter  and her infant to be put into a chest, and cast adrift on the sea,  but they were rescued by Dictys, a fisherman. When grown to manhood,  Perseus accidentally struck the foot of Acrisius with a quoit, and the  blow caused his death. This tale is told by Mr. Morris in _The Earthly  Paradise_ (April).    ACTAE'ON, a hunter, changed by Diana into a stag. A synonym for a  cuckold.      Divulge Page himself for a secure and wilful    Actaeon [cuckold].    Shakespeare, _Merry Wives_, etc., act iii. sc. 2 (1596).    ACTE'A, a female slave faithful to Nero in his fall. It was this  hetaera who wrapped the dead body in cerements, and saw it decently  interred.      This Actea was beautiful. She was seated on    the ground; the head of Nero was on her lap,    his naked body was stretched on those winding-sheets    in which she was about to fold him, to lay    him in his grave upon the garden hill.--Ouida,    _Ariadne_, i. 7.    ACTORS AND ACTRESSES. The last male actor that took a woman's  character on the stage was Edward Kynaston, noted for his beauty  (1619-1687). The first female actor for hire was Mrs. Saunderson,  afterwards Mrs. Betterton, who died in 1712.    AD, AD'ITES (2 _syl_.). Ad is a tribe descended from Ad, son of Uz,  son of Irem, son of Shem, son of Noah. The tribe, at the Confusion  of Babel, went and settled on Al-Ahkaf [_the Winding Sands_], in the  province of Hadramant. Shedad was their first king, but in consequence  of his pride, both he and all the tribe perished, either from drought  or the Sarsar (_an icy wind_).--Sale's _Koran_, 1.      Woe, woe, to Irem! Woe to Ad!    Death, has gone up into her palaces!....    They fell around me. Thousands fell around.    The king and all his people fell;    All, all, they perished all.      Southey, _Thalaba the Destroyer_, i. 41, 45 (1797).    A'DAH, wife of Cain. After Cain had been conducted by Lucifer through  the realms of space, he is restored to the home of his wife and child,  where all is beauty, gentleness, and love. Full of faith and fervent  in gratitude, Adah loves her infant with a sublime maternal affection.  She sees him sleeping, and says to Cain--      How lovely he appears! His little cheeks    In their pure incarnation, vying with    The rose leaves strewn beneath them.    And his lips, too,    How beautifully parted! No; you shall not    Kiss him; at least not now. He will awake soon--    His hour of midday rest is nearly over.      Byron, _Cain_.    ADAM. In _Greek_ this word is compounded of the four initial letters  of the cardinal quarters:      Arktos, [Greek: _arktos_]. north.    Dusis, [Greek: _dusis_]. west.    Anatole, [Greek: _anatolae_]. east.    Mesembria, [Greek: _mesaembria_]. south.    The _Hebrew_ word ADM forms the anagram of A [dam], D [avid], M  [essiah].    _Adam, how made_. God created the body of Adam of _Salzal_, _i.e._  dry, unbaked clay, and left it forty nights without a soul. The clay  was collected by Azrael from the four quarters of the earth, and God,  to show His approval of Azrael's choice, constituted him the angel of  death.--Rabadan.    _Adam, Eve, and the Serpent_. After the fall _Adam_ was placed on  mount Vassem in the east; _Eve_ was banished to Djidda (now Gedda,  on the Arabian coast); and the _Serpent_ was exiled to the coast of  Eblehh.    After the lapse of 100 years Adam rejoined Eve on mount Arafaith  [_place of Remembrance_], near Mecca.--D'Ohsson.    _Death of Adam_. Adam died on Friday, April 7, at the age of 930  years. Michael swathed his body, and Gabriel discharged the funeral  rites. The body was buried at Ghar'ul-Kenz [_the grotto of treasure_],  which overlooks Mecca.    His descendants at death amounted to 40,000 souls.--D'Ohsson.    When Noah, entered the ark (the same writer says) he took the body of  Adam in a coffin with him, and when he left the ark restored it to the  place he had taken it from.    _Adam_, a bailiff, a jailer.    Not that Adam that kept the paradise, but that Adam that keeps the  prison.--Shakespeare, _Comedy of Errors_, act iv. sc. 3 (1593).    _Adam_, a faithful retainer in the family of sir Eowland de Boys. At  the age of fourscore, he voluntarily accompanied his young master  Orlando into exile, and offered to give him his little savings.  He has given birth to the phrase, \"A Faithful Adam\" [_or  man-servant_].--Shakespeare, _As You Like It_ (1598).    ADAM BELL, a northern outlaw, noted for his archery. The name, like  those of Clym of the Clough, William of Cloudesly, Robin Hood, and  Little John, is synonymous with a good archer.    ADAMASTOR, the Spirit of the Cape, a hideous phantom, of unearthly  pallor; \"erect his hair uprose of withered red, his lips were black,  his teeth blue and disjointed, his beard haggard, his face scarred by  lightning, his eyes shot livid fire, his voice roared.\" The sailors  trembled at sight of him, and the fiend demanded how they dared to  trespass \"where never hero braved his rage before?\" He then told them  \"that every year the shipwrecked should be made to deplore their  foolhardiness.\"--Camoeens, _The Lusiad_, v. (1569).    ADAM'IDA, a planet on which reside the unborn spirits of saints,  martyrs, and believers. U'riel, the angel of the sun, was ordered  at the crucifixion to interpose this planet between the sun and the  earth, so as to produce a total eclipse.    Adamida, in obedience to the divine command, flew amidst overwhelming  storms, rushing clouds, falling mountains, and swelling seas. Uriel  stood on the pole of the star, but so lost in deep contemplation on  Golgotha, that he heard not the wild uproar. On coming to the region  of the sun, Adamida slackened her course, and advancing before the  sun, covered its face and intercepted all its rays.--Klopstock, _The  Messiah_, viii. (1771).    ADAMS _(John)_, one of the mutineers of the _Bounty_ (1790), who  settled in Tahiti. In 1814 he was discovered as the patriarch of a  colony, brought up with a high sense of religion and strict regard to  morals. In 1839 the colony was voluntarily placed under the protection  of the British Government.    _Adams (Parson)_, the beau-ideal of a simple-minded, benevolent, but  eccentric country clergyman, of unswerving integrity, solid learning,  and genuine piety; bold as a lion in the cause of truth, but modest as  a girl in all personal matters; wholly ignorant of the world, being  \"_in_ it but not _of_ of it.\"--Fielding, _Joseph Andrews_ (1742).    His learning, his simplicity, his evangelical purity of mind are so  admirably mingled with pedantry, absence of mind, and the habit of  athletic ... exercise ... that he may be safely termed one of the  richest productions of the muse of fiction. Like Don Quixote, parson  Adams is beaten a little too much and too often, but the cudgel  lights upon his shoulders ... without the slightest stain to his  reputation.--Sir W. Scott.    AD'DISON OF THE NORTH, Henry Mackenzie, author of _The Man of Feeling_  (1745-1831).    ADELAIDE, daughter of the count of Narbonne, in love with Theodore.  She is killed by her father in mistake for another.--Robt. Jephson,  _Count of Narbonne_ (1782).    ADELAIDE FISHER, daughter-in-law of Grandpa and Grandma Fisher in  Sallie Pratt McLean Greene's _Cape Cod Folks_. She has a sweet voice  and an edged temper, and it would seem from certain cynical remarks  of her own, and Grandma's \"Thar, daughter, I wouldn't mind!\" has a  history she does not care to reveal (1881).    ADELAIDE YATES, the wife of Steve Yates and mother of Little Moses in  Charles Egbert Craddock's _In the \"Stranger People's\" Country_. Her  husband has been seized and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11438"],[0,"The Willows (#3)"],[1,"foaming waves, swept rapidly  past. It kept disappearing and coming up to the surface again. It was about  twenty feet from the shore, and just as it was opposite to where we stood  it lurched round and looked straight at us. We saw its eyes reflecting the  sunset, and gleaming an odd yellow as the body turned over. Then it gave a  swift, gulping plunge, and dived out of sight in a flash.    \"An otter, by gad!\" we exclaimed in the same breath, laughing.    It was an otter, alive, and out on the hunt; yet it had looked exactly like  the body of a drowned man turning helplessly in the current. Far below it  came to the surface once again, and we saw its black skin, wet and shining  in the sunlight.    Then, too, just as we turned back, our arms full of driftwood, another  thing happened to recall us to the river bank. This time it really was a  man, and what was more, a man in a boat. Now a small boat on the Danube was  an unusual sight at any time, but here in this deserted region, and at  flood time, it was so unexpected as to constitute a real event. We stood  and stared.    Whether it was due to the slanting sunlight, or the refraction from the  wonderfully illumined water, I cannot say, but, whatever the cause, I found  it difficult to focus my sight properly upon the flying apparition. It  seemed, however, to be a man standing upright in a sort of flat-bottomed  boat, steering with a long oar, and being carried down the opposite shore  at a tremendous pace. He apparently was looking across in our direction,  but the distance was too great and the light too uncertain for us to make  out very plainly what he was about. It seemed to me that he was  gesticulating and making signs at us. His voice came across the water to us  shouting something furiously, but the wind drowned it so that no single  word was audible. There was something curious about the whole  appearance--man, boat, signs, voice--that made an impression on me out of  all proportion to its cause.    \"He's crossing himself!\" I cried. \"Look, he's making the sign of the  Cross!\"    \"I believe you're right,\" the Swede said, shading his eyes with his hand  and watching the man out of sight. He seemed to be gone in a moment,  melting away down there into the sea of willows where the sun caught them  in the bend of the river and turned them into a great crimson wall of  beauty. Mist, too, had begun to ruse, so that the air was hazy.    \"But what in the world is he doing at nightfall on this flooded river?\" I  said, half to myself. \"Where is he going at such a time, and what did he  mean by his signs and shouting? D'you think he wished to warn us about  something?\"    \"He saw our smoke, and thought we were spirits probably,\" laughed my  companion. \"These Hungarians believe in all sorts of rubbish; you remember  the shopwoman at Pressburg warning us that no one ever landed here because  it belonged to some sort of beings outside man's world! I suppose they  believe in fairies and elementals, possibly demons, too. That peasant in  the boat saw people on the islands for the first time in his life,\" he  added, after a slight pause, \"and it scared him, that's all.\"    The Swede's tone of voice was not convincing, and his manner lacked  something that was usually there. I noted the change instantly while he  talked, though without being able to label it precisely.    \"If they had enough imagination,\" I laughed loudly--I remember trying to  make as much noise as I could--\"they might well people a place like this  with the old gods of antiquity. The Romans must have haunted all this  region more or less with their shrines and sacred groves and elemental  deities.\"    The subject dropped and we returned to our stew-pot, for my friend was not  given to imaginative conversation as a rule. Moreover, just then I remember  feeling distinctly glad that he was not imaginative; his stolid, practical  nature suddenly seemed to me welcome and comforting. It was an admirable  temperament, I felt; he could steer down rapids like a red Indian, shoot  dangerous bridges and whirlpools better than any white man I ever saw in a  canoe. He was a grand fellow for an adventurous trip, a tower of strength  when untoward things happened. I looked at his strong face and light curly  hair as he staggered along under his pile of driftwood (twice the size of  mine!), and I experienced a feeling of relief. Yes, I was distinctly glad  just then that the Swede was--what he was, and that he never made remarks  that suggested more than they said.    \"The river's still rising, though,\" he added, as if following out some  thoughts of his own, and dropping his load with a gasp. \"This island will  be under water in two days if it goes on.\"    \"I wish the wind would go down,\" I said. \"I don't care a fig for the  river.\"    The flood, indeed, had no terrors for us; we could get off at ten minutes'  notice, and the more water the better we liked it. It meant an increasing  current and the obliteration of the treacherous shingle-beds that so often  threatened to tear the bottom out of our canoe.    Contrary to our expectations, the wind did not go down with the sun. It  seemed to increase with the darkness, howling overhead and shaking the  willows round us like straws. Curious sounds accompanied it sometimes, like  the explosion of heavy guns, and it fell upon the water and the island in  great flat blows of immense power. It made me think of the sounds a planet  must make, could we only hear it, driving along through space.    But the sky kept wholly clear of clouds, and soon after supper the full  moon rose up in the east and covered the river and the plain of shouting  willows with a light like the day.    We lay on the sandy patch beside the fire, smoking, listening to the noises  of the night round us, and talking happily of the journey we had already  made, and of our plans ahead. The map lay spread in the door of the tent,  but the high wind made it hard to study, and presently we lowered the  curtain and extinguished the lantern. The firelight was enough to smoke and  see each other's faces by, and the sparks flew about overhead like  fireworks. A few yards beyond, the river gurgled and hissed, and from time  to time a heavy splash announced the falling away of further portions of  the bank.    Our talk, I noticed, had to do with the faraway scenes and incidents of our  first camps in the Black Forest, or of other subjects altogether remote  from the present setting, for neither of us spoke of the actual moment more  than was necessary--almost as though we had agreed tacitly to avoid  discussion of the camp and its incidents. Neither the otter nor the  boatman, for instance, received the honor of a single mention, though  ordinarily these would have furnished discussion for the greater part of  the evening. They were, of course, distinct events in such a place.    The scarcity of wood made it a business to keep the fire going, for the  wind, that drove the smoke in our faces wherever we sat, helped at the same  time to make a forced draught. We took it in turn to make some foraging  expeditions into the darkness, and the quantity the Swede brought back  always made me feel that he took an absurdly long time finding it; for the  fact was I did not care much about being left alone, and yet it always  seemed to be my turn to grub about among the bushes or scramble along the  slippery banks in the moonlight. The long day's battle with wind and  water--such wind and such water!--had tired us both, and an early bed was  the obvious program. Yet neither of us made the move for the tent. We lay  there, tending the fire, talking in desultory fashion, peering about us  into the dense willow bushes, and listening to the thunder of wind and  river. The loneliness of the place had entered our very bones, and silence  seemed natural, for after a bit the sound of our voices became a trifle  unreal and forced; whispering would have been the fitting mode of  communication, I felt, and the human voice, always rather absurd amid the  roar of the elements, now carried with it something almost illegitimate. It  was like talking out loud in church, or in some place where it was not  lawful, perhaps not quite safe, to be overheard.    The eeriness of this lonely island, set among a million willows, swept by a  hurricane, and surrounded by hurrying deep waters, touched us both, I  fancy. Untrodden by man, almost unknown to man, it lay there beneath the  moon, remote from human influence, on the frontier of another world, an  alien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of willows. And  we, in our rashness, had dared to invade it, even to make use of it!  Something more than the power of its mystery stirred in me as I lay on the  sand, feet to fire, and peered up through the leaves at the stars. For the  last time I rose to get firewood.    \"When this has burnt up,\" I said firmly, \"I shall turn in,\" and my  companion watched me lazily as I moved off into the surrounding shadows.    For an unimaginative man I thought he seemed unusually receptive that  night, unusually open to suggestion of things other than sensory. He too  was touched by the beauty and loneliness of the place. I was not altogether  pleased, I remember, to recognize this slight change in him, and instead of  immediately collecting sticks, I made my way to the far point of the island  where the moonlight on plain and river could be seen to better advantage.  The desire to be alone had come suddenly upon me; my former dread returned  in force; there was a vague feeling in me I wished to face and probe to the  bottom.    When I reached the point of sand jutting out among the waves, the spell of  the place descended upon me with a positive shock. No mere \"scenery\" could  have produced such an effect. There was something more here, something to  alarm.    I gazed across the waste of wild waters; I watched the whispering willows;  I"]]]
