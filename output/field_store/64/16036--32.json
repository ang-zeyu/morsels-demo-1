Even the  exterior of this handsome building, erected in the style of the Italian  renaissance after the design of Miss Sophia G. Hayden of Boston--with its  exquisite sculptural decorations--executed by Miss Alice Rideout of St.  Francisco--bore testimony to the fact, that women are entitled to enter  into competition with their male colleagues.    Here, we beheld exhibits forwarded to this unique structure by women of  every clime and section of the globe. Even ladies of European monarchal  families were represented--the Queen of England and her daughters by works  of art--the Empresses of Germany, Russia, and Austria as well as the Queen  of Italy by costly laces--often the work of their own hands--and  invaluable jewels--with romantic histories.    The decorative needle-work exhibit constituted a very selected and  complete collection; there being offered to view pieces of embroidery to  the value of $8,000.    All that was to be seen in this edifice proved the opinion that women are  justified in demanding a position equal to men.    Nevertheless, many refuse to acknowledge this claim of equalization by  pronouncing woman inferior to man concerning intellectual abilities. Daily  experience and the records of the past, however, demonstrate sufficiently  that many modern industrial pursuits have successfully been carried on by  female activity. Not only the occupations, which require manual dexterity  and good taste, also the higher branches of various sciences and arts have  been excellently mastered by educated ladies, performing professional  duties, whose execution demands a vast amount of intelligence and  learning. Thus the official U.S. census of 1890 contained the enumeration  of 2,438 doctresses; 110 female lawyers; 2,136 architectresses; and  155,000 lady teachers in public schools. Among the students, attending the  diverse colleges in the Republic, more than 18,000 are young ladies. Even  as inventors, women have distinguished themselves, as we may judge from  the fact that during the last three decades, about 2,500 patents have been  granted to female claimants, and scientific papers published--in 1884--a  list of contrivances deriving their existence from the inventiveness of  females.    Of the uncountable evidences of woman's inventive genius, the enumeration  of the following devices and improvements may suffice: a chain elevator;  an appliance for lessening the noise of elevated cars; a lubricating felt  for diminishing friction (very useful for railroad cars); a portable  water-reservoir for extinguishing small fires; an apparatus for weighing  wool (one of the most sensitive machines ever invented, and of  incalculable advantage for the wool industry); a rotary loom (performing  thrice the work of an ordinary one); furthermore, manifold improvements to  the sewing-machine, such as a device for threading the needle while the  machine is in full operation; an appliance for sewing leather--contrived  by a woman in New York who runs a saddlery business there--; and many  others. To the sensational inventions, originated in female brains,  belong--the sea-telescope devised by Mrs. Mather, an instrument for the  purpose of examining the keel of a ship without requiring her being put  into the dry-dock--and a complicated machine for manufacturing paper bags,  a very intricate affair which many eminent mechanicians have made but  unsuccessful efforts to contrive. Since then, Miss Maggie Knight, the  inventress of the machine above mentioned, has found out another; namely  for folding paper-bags. The latter performs the work of thirty men, and  has been put up under that lady's personal supervision in Amherst, Mass.    The wonderful achievements made by women in America, have not been  attained by females of any other country on the globe. This circumstance  is mainly due to the fact that the public school as well as the college  system in the United States--contrary to that of other nations--makes a  finished education accessible to both men and women.    According to a report given by President White of the University of  Michigan--an institution that admits students of both sexes--out of 1,300  attendants of the Greek class, the best scholar was a young lady. In  mathematics and other scientific studies, girls had the highest standing.  Furthermore, the profession of teaching in this country is principally in  the hands of women; which proves that the possibility of cultivating the  female mind to a high stage of perfection is absolutely unquestionable.    Moreover, philosophers of modern times have demonstrated that it is wrong  to assign to woman a position inferior to man by basing it on the  theory--that her brains have smaller dimensions. For, it is not the  quantity of the _viscus_ alone that settles this scientific question; but  the weight of the brains in direct proportion to that of the person's  body.    Recent scientific researches, accomplished by the noted Parisian  physiologist Broca, yielded the result that the ratio of woman's brains  compared with man's, contains even a surplus of one to four per cent.    Now, that science acknowledges that the female intellect is educable to  the same degree as that of man; would it not appear to be a perversion of  judgment to undervalue ingenuity, because it accidentally had its seat in  female brains? Would it not be unjust to leave talents undeveloped and  without cultivation, simply because a woman possesses them?    The active part woman took in the promotion of the Columbian Exposition is  additional proof of her ability; and on this occasion she comes to the  front rank more than ever before in her history.    Repairing to the northern portion of the park, we entered the \"ART PALACE\"  through the southern of its four main entrances. We found ourselves in a  gallery where the magnificent sculpture exhibit captivated our eyes.    In the court running east and west, we beheld a fine display of  architecture showing models of many famous edifices in the world, and  their exquisite portals and architectural ornaments.    The American section located in the northeastern part of the building,  comprised a collection _par excellence_ of elegant paintings, masterpieces  from the best artists of this country. Very interesting was the  retrospective art exhibit in this department; illustrating the various  stages in the development of American art, from its incipiency to the  present perfection.    The remaining space in the eastern pavilion was taken up by the French  _division_, which--we acknowledged unanimously--contained the most  laudable contribution made by a foreign nation.    Great Britain's select display, representing some of its great artists,  constituted the most extensive foreign section next to France.    German art was represented by 580 fine paintings, including all the German  schools that have gained celebrity; as the Bavarian in Munich--the Saxon  in Dresden--and many others.--Holland, Belgium, Russia, Spain, Austria,  Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Canada had their share in the splendid  effect, likewise.    The Japanese showing, elucidating the style of art, peculiar to that  skillful nation, was very attractive and novel.    If we trace back the records of the previous international expositions, we  cannot find any report giving account of a similar collection representing  modern works of art. In consequence of political causes, France had seldom  made contributions to any but her own _expositions_. But the United  States, not fostering hostility with any nation, was universally assisted  in her gigantic enterprise. In fact, it would require volumes to describe  in detail this elaborate display, whose prominent part--the home  exhibits--verified Irving's words: \"In America literature and the elegant  arts must grow up side by side with the coarser plants of daily  necessity.\"    The Art Palace environed groups and figures in marble and bronze, and  other sculptural master-pieces--paintings in oil and water colors, on  ivory, enamel, metal, and porcelain--fresco paintings on walls--  engravings--etchings--pastel and many studies in chalk and charcoal; in  short, every description of modern progress in this direction, even to  excellent effects produced on wood with hot irons.    Art is but the human effort to seize some of Nature's notable transitory  features to perpetuate them. The unusual scenes of grandeur and of beauty  our divine mother reveals to us in some of her moods, we adore, while they  are inspirations to the poet and painter; and in this untiring course of  art, many geniuses have become apotheosized.    To take a lovely landscape at sunset: when from the side of some  enchanting stream, you look toward the mountains in the west, and see the  crimson and light blue curtains of the evening slowly shaken out; their  fringes of burnished gold glowing with indescribable magnificence--who can  portray it and do it justice? This evening robing of those variegated  crests! That mingling of color, until it fades into deep violet dyes! They  in their turn passing away to give place to the jewels of the night, whose  unchanging song of eternal praise goes on----    Before such scenes, a Corot, or an Aubert dips the pencil in the glowing  sky, and transfers its hues to the canvas; so that, in after time, our  souls are gladdened by some retrospect, which makes life dearer to us  amidst its cares.    We must not consider art as the rival of nature, but her child that pays  to her the most graceful tribute of homage by making her impressions  permanent.

And the Prince of Bekhten [also] caused his gifts to be brought, and he  set his eldest daughter at the head of them all, and he addressed words  of praise to His Majesty, and prayed to him for his life.  And the  maiden was beautiful, and His Majesty considered her to be the most  lovely [woman] in the world, and he wrote down as her title, \"Great  Royal Wife, Ra-neferu\"; and when His Majesty arrived in Egypt, he did  for her whatsoever was done for the Royal Wife.    On the twenty-second day of the second month of the season of  Shemu,[FN#160] in the fifteenth year [of his reign], behold, His  Majesty was in Thebes, the Mighty [city], the Mistress of cities,  performing the praises of Father Amen, the Lord of the thrones of the  Two Lands, in his beautiful Festival of the Southern Apt,[FN#161] which  was the seat of his heart (i.e., the chosen spot) from primaeval time,  [when] one came to say to His Majesty, \"An ambassador of the Prince of  Bekhten hath arrived bearing many gifts for the Royal Wife.\"        [FN#160]  The summer.  The Copts called the second month of this season  Paoni.      [FN#161]  The modern Temple of Luxor.        And having been brought into the presence of His Majesty with his  gifts, he spake words of adoration to His Majesty, saying, \"Praise be  unto thee, O thou Sun (Ra) of the Nine Nations of the Bow, permit us to  live before thee!\"  And when he had spoken, and had smelt the earth  before His Majesty, he continued his speech before His Majesty, saying,  \"I have come unto thee, my King and Lord, on behalf of Bent-Resht, the  younger sister of the Royal Wife Ra-neferu.  [Some] disease hath  penetrated into her members, and I beseech Thy Majesty to send a man of  learning to see her.\"      And His Majesty said, \"Bring to me the magicians (or, scribes) of the  House of Life, and the nobles of the palace.\"  And having been brought  into his presence straightway, His Majesty said unto them, \"Behold, I  have caused you to be summoned [hither] in order that ye may hear this  matter.  Now bring to me [one] of your company whose heart is  wise[FN#162], and whose fingers are deft.\"  And the royal scribe  Tehuti-em-heb came into the presence of His Majesty, and His Majesty  commanded him to depart to Bekhten with that ambassador.        [FN#162]  Or, a skilled craftsman.          And when the man of learning had arrived in Bekhten, he found Bent-  Resht in the condition of a woman who is possessed by a spirit, and he  found 12 this spirit to be an evil one, and to be hostile in his  disposition towards him.    And the Prince of Bekhten sent a messenger a second time into the  presence of His Majesty, saying, \"O King, my Lord, I pray His (i.e.,  Thy) Majesty to command that a god be brought hither to contend  against the spirit.\"      Now when the messenger came to His Majesty in the first month[FN#163]  of the season of Shemu, in the twenty-sixth year [of his reign], on the  day which coincided with that of the Festival of Amen, His Majesty was  in the palace (or, temple?) of Thebes.  And His Majesty spake a second  time[FN#164] in the presence of Khensu in Thebes, [called] \"Nefer-  Hetep,\" saying, \"O my fair Lord, I present myself before thee a second  time on behalf of the daughter of the Prince of Bekhten.\"  Then Khensu,  in Thebes, [called] \"Nefer-Hetep\", was carried to Khensu, [called] \"Pa-  ari-sekher,\" the great god who driveth away the spirits which attack.  And His Majesty spake before Khensu in Thebes, [called] \"Nefer-Hetep,\"  saying, \"O my fair Lord, if thou wilt give (i.e., turn) thy face to  Khensu, [called] 'Pa-ari-sekher,' the great god who driveth away the  spirits which attack, permit thou that he may depart to Bekhten;\" [and  the god] inclined his head with a deep inclination twice.  And His  Majesty said, \"Let, I pray, thy protective (or, magical) power [go]  with him, so that I may make His Majesty to go to Bekhten to deliver  the daughter of the Prince of Bekhten [from the spirit].\"        [FN#163]  The month Pakhon of the Copts.
