In short, these six  parties, during the month, enable me to pay my rent, and produce me a  tolerable pittance.\"    This meloncholy recital affected me so much, that, on its being  terminated, I was unable to speak; but I have reason to think that a  favourable construction was put on my silence. A volume, of the size  of a family bible, would not be sufficient to display half the  contrasts engendered by the revolution. Many a _Marquise_ has been  obliged to turn sempstress, in order to gain a livelihood; but my  friend the _Comtesse_ had much ready wit, though no talents of that  description. Having soothed her mind by venting a few imprecations  against the murderers of her departed relatives, she informed me that  her company began to assemble between the hours of eleven and twelve,  and begged that I would not fail to come to her    PRIVATE BALL.    About twelve o'clock, I accordingly went thither, as I had promised,  when I found the rooms perfectly crowded. Among a number of very  agreeable ladies, several were to be distinguished for the elegance  of their figure, though there were no more than three remarkable for  beauty. These terrestrial divinities would not only have embarrassed  the Grand Signior for a preference, but even have distracted the  choice of the Idalian shepherd himself. The dancing was already begun  to an excellent band of music, led by Citizen JULIEN, a mulatto,  esteemed the first player of country-dances in Paris. Of the dancers,  some of the women really astonished me by the ease and gracefulness  of their movements: steps, which are known to be the most difficult,  seemed to cost them not the smallest exertion. Famous as they have  ever been for dancing, they seem now, in Cibber's words, \"to outdo  their usual outdoings.\"    In former times, an extraordinary degree of curiosity was excited by  any female who excelled in this pleasing accomplishment. I remember  to have read that Don Juan of Austria, governor of the Low Countries,  set out post from Brussels, and came to Paris _incog._ on purpose to  see Marguerite de Valois dance at a dress-ball, this princess being  reckoned, at that time, the best dancer in Europe. What then would be  the admiration of such an _amateur_, could he now behold the  perfection attained here by some of the beauties of the present day?    The men, doubtless, determined to vie with the women, seemed to pride  themselves more on agility than grace, and, by attempting whatever  required extraordinary effort, reminded me of _figurans_ on the  stage, so much have the Parisian youth adopted a truly theatrical  style of dancing.    The French country-dances (or cotilions, as we term them in England)  and waltzes, which are as much in vogue here as in Germany, were  regularly interchanged. However, the Parisians, in my opinion, cannot  come up to the Germans in this, their native dance. I should have  wished to have had Lavater by my side, and heard his opinion of the  characters of the different female waltzers. It is a very curious and  interesting spectacle to see one woman assume a languishing air,  another a vacant smile, a third an aspect of stoical indifference;  while a fourth seems lost in a voluptuous trance, a fifth captivates  by an amiable modesty, a sixth affects the cold insensibility of a  statue, and so on in ever-varying succession, though all turning to  the animating changes of the same lively waltz. In short I observed  that, in this species of dance, the eyes and feet of almost every  woman appeared to be constantly at variance.    Without assuming the part of a moralist, I cannot help thinking that  Werter was not altogether in the wrong when he swore, that, were it  to cost him his life, no woman on whom he had set his affections,  should ever waltz with any one but himself. I am not singular in this  opinion; for I recollect to have met with the same ideas in a book  written by M. JACOBI, I think, a German author.    Speaking of the waltz, \"We either ought,\" says he, \"not to boast so  much of the propriety of our manners, or else not suffer that our  wives and daughters, in a complete delirium, softly pressed in the  arms of men, bosom to bosom, should thus be hurried away by the sound  of intoxicating music. In this _whirligig_ dance, every one seems to  forget the rules of decorum; and though an innocent, young creature,  exposed in this manner, were to remain pure and spotless, can she,  without horror, reflect that she becomes, the sport of the  imagination of the licentious youths to whom she so abandons herself?  It were to be wished,\" adds he, \"that our damsels (I mean those who  preserve any vestige of bashfulness), might, concealed in a private  corner, hear sometimes the conversation of those very men to whom  they yield themselves with so little reserve and caution.\"    To the best of my recollection, these are the sentiments of M.  JACOBI, expressed twelve or fourteen years ago; yet I do not find  that the waltz is discontinued, or even less practised, in Germany,  than it was at the time when his work first appeared. This dance,  like every other French fashion, has now found its way into England,  and is introduced between the acts, by way of interlude I presume, at  some of our grand private balls and assemblies. But, however I may be  amused by the waltzing of the Parisian belles, I feel too much regard  for my fair country-women to wish to see them adopt a dance, which,  by throwing them off their guard, lays them completely open to the  shafts of ridicule and malice.    Leaving this point to be settled by the worthy part of our British  matrons, let us return to the Parisian ball, from which I have been  led into a little digression.    The dancing continued in this manner, that is, French country-dances  and waltzes alternately, till four o'clock, when soup was brought  round to all the company. This was dispatched _sans fa√ßon_, as fast  as it could be procured. It was a prelude to the cold supper, which  was presently served in another spacious apartment. No sooner were  the folding-doors of an adjoining room thrown open, than I observed  that, large as it was, it could not possibly afford accommodation to  more than half of the number present. I therefore remained in the  back-ground, naturally supposing that places would first be provided  for all the women. Not so, my friend; several men seated themselves,  and, in the twinkling of an eye, deranged the economy of the whole  table; while the female bystanders were necessitated to seek seats at  some temporary tables placed in the ballroom. Here too were they in  luck if they obtained a few fragments from the grand board; for, such  determined voracity was there exhibited, that so many vultures or  cormorants could not have been more expeditious in clearing the  dishes.    For instance, an enormous salmon, which would have done honour to the  Tweed or the Severn, graced the middle of the principal table. In  less than five minutes after the company were seated, I turned round,  and missing the fish, inquired whether it had proved tainted. No: but  it is all devoured, was the reply of a young man, who, pointing to  the bone, offered me a pear and a piece of bread, which he shrewdly  observed was all that I might probably get to recruit my strength at  this entertainment. I took the hint, and, with the addition of a  glass of common wine, at once made my supper.    In half an hour, the tables being removed, the ball was resumed, and  apparently with renewed spirit. The card-room had never been  deserted. _Mind the main chance_ is a wholesome maxim, which the good  lady of the house seemed not to have forgotten. Assisted by a sort of  _croupier_, she did the honours of the _bouillotte_ with that  admirable sang-froid which you and I have often witnessed in some of  our hostesses of fashion; and, had she not communicated to me the  secret, I should have been the last to suspect, while she appeared so  indifferent, that she, like those ladies, had so great an interest in  the card-party being continued till morning.    As an old acquaintance, she took an opportunity of saying to, me,  with joy in her eyes: \"_Le jeu va bien_;\" but, at the same time,  expressed her regret that the supper was such a scramble. While we  were in conversation, I inquired the name and character of the most  striking women in the room, and found that, though a few of them  might be reckoned substantial in fortune, as well as in reputation,  the female part of the company was chiefly composed of ladies who,  like herself, had suffered by the revolution; several were divorced  from their husbands, but as incompatibility of temper was the general  plea for such a disunion, that alone could not operate as a blemish.    To judge of the political predilection of these belles from their  exterior, a stranger would, nine times out of ten, be led into a  palpable error. He might naturally conclude them to be attached to a  republican system, since they have, in general, adopted the Athenian  form of attire as their model; though they have not, in the smallest  degree, adopted the simple manners of that people. Their arms are  bare almost to the very shoulder; their bosom is, in a great measure,  uncovered; their ankles are encircled by narrow ribbands in imitation  of the fastenings of sandals; and their hair, turned up close behind,  is confined on the crown of the head in a large knot, as we see it in  the antique busts of Grecian beauties.    The rest of their dress is more calculated to display, than to veil  the contours of their person. It was thus explained to me by my  friend, the _ci-devant Comtesse_, who at the same time assured  me  that young French women, clad in this airy manner,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#20)"],[1,"rage.  These root words were so  similar to those in use among the great anthropoids as to suggest that  the language of the Manus was the mother tongue.  At best it lent  itself to but material and sordid exchange.  Dreams, aspirations, hopes,  the past, the future held no place in the conversation of Manu, the  monkey. All was of the present--particularly of filling his belly and  catching lice.    Poor food was this to nourish the mental appetite of a girl just upon  the brink of womanhood.  And so, finding Manu only amusing as an  occasional playfellow or pet, Meriem poured out her sweetest soul  thoughts into the deaf ears of Geeka's ivory head.  To Geeka she spoke  in Arabic, knowing that Geeka, being but a doll, could not understand  the language of Korak and Akut, and that the language of Korak and Akut  being that of male apes contained nothing of interest to an Arab doll.    Geeka had undergone a transformation since her little mother had left  the village of The Sheik.  Her garmenture now reflected in miniature  that of Meriem.  A tiny bit of leopard skin covered her ratskin torso  from shoulder to splinter knee.  A band of braided grasses about her  brow held in place a few gaudy feathers from the parakeet, while other  bits of grass were fashioned into imitations of arm and leg ornaments  of metal.  Geeka was a perfect little savage; but at heart she was  unchanged, being the same omnivorous listener as of yore.  An excellent  trait in Geeka was that she never interrupted in order to talk about  herself.  Today was no exception.  She had been listening attentively  to Meriem for an hour, propped against the bole of a tree while her  lithe, young mistress stretched catlike and luxurious along a swaying  branch before her.    \"Little Geeka,\" said Meriem, \"our Korak has been gone for a long time  today.  We miss him, little Geeka, do we not?  It is dull and lonesome  in the great jungle when our Korak is away.  What will he bring us this  time, eh?  Another shining band of metal for Meriem's ankle?  Or a  soft, doeskin loin cloth from the body of a black she?  He tells me  that it is harder to get the possessions of the shes, for he will not  kill them as he does the males, and they fight savagely when he leaps  upon them to wrest their ornaments from them.  Then come the males with  spears and arrows and Korak takes to the trees.  Sometimes he takes the  she with him and high among the branches divests her of the things he  wishes to bring home to Meriem.  He says that the blacks fear him now,  and at first sight of him the women and children run shrieking to their  huts; but he follows them within, and it is not often that he returns  without arrows for himself and a present for Meriem.  Korak is mighty  among the jungle people--our Korak, Geeka--no, MY Korak!\"    Meriem's conversation was interrupted by the sudden plunge of an  excited little monkey that landed upon her shoulders in a flying leap  from a neighboring tree.    \"Climb!\" he cried.  \"Climb!  The Mangani are coming.\"    Meriem glanced lazily over her shoulder at the excited disturber of her  peace.    \"Climb, yourself, little Manu,\" she said.  \"The only Mangani in our  jungle are Korak and Akut.  It is they you have seen returning from the  hunt.  Some day you will see your own shadow, little Manu, and then you  will be frightened to death.\"    But the monkey only screamed his warning more lustily before he raced  upward toward the safety of the high terrace where Mangani, the great  ape, could not follow.  Presently Meriem heard the sound of approaching  bodies swinging through the trees.  She listened attentively.  There  were two and they were great apes--Korak and Akut.  To her Korak was an  ape--a Mangani, for as such the three always described themselves.  Man  was an enemy, so they did not think of themselves as belonging any  longer to the same genus.  Tarmangani, or great white ape, which  described the white man in their language, did not fit them all.  Gomangani--great black ape, or Negro--described none of them so they  called themselves plain Mangani.    Meriem decided that she would feign slumber and play a joke on Korak.  So she lay very still with eyes tightly closed.  She heard the two  approaching closer and closer.  They were in the adjoining tree now and  must have discovered her, for they had halted.  Why were they so quiet?  Why did not Korak call out his customary greeting?  The quietness was  ominous.  It was followed presently by a very stealthy sound--one of  them was creeping upon her.  Was Korak planning a joke upon his own  account?  Well, she would fool him.  Cautiously she opened her eyes the  tiniest bit, and as she did so her heart stood still.  Creeping  silently toward her was a huge bull ape that she never before had seen.  Behind him was another like him.    With the agility of a squirrel Meriem was upon her feet and at the same  instant the great bull lunged for her.  Leaping from limb to limb the  girl fled through the jungle while close behind her came the two great  apes.  Above them raced a bevy of screaming, chattering monkeys,  hurling taunts and insults at the Mangani, and encouragement and advice  to the girl.    From tree to tree swung Meriem working ever upward toward the smaller  branches which would not bear the weight of her pursuers.  Faster and  faster came the bull apes after her.  The clutching fingers of the  foremost were almost upon her again and again, but she eluded them by  sudden bursts of speed or reckless chances as she threw herself across  dizzy spaces.    Slowly she was gaining her way to the greater heights where safety lay,  when, after a particularly daring leap, the swaying branch she grasped  bent low beneath her weight, nor whipped upward again as it should have  done.  Even before the rending sound which followed Meriem knew that  she had misjudged the strength of the limb.  It gave slowly at first.  Then there was a ripping as it parted from the trunk.  Releasing her  hold Meriem dropped among the foliage beneath, clutching for a new  support.  She found it a dozen feet below the broken limb.  She had  fallen thus many times before, so that she had no particular terror of  a fall--it was the delay which appalled her most, and rightly, for  scarce had she scrambled to a place of safety than the body of the huge  ape dropped at her side and a great, hairy arm went about her waist.    Almost at once the other ape reached his companion's side.  He made a  lunge at Meriem; but her captor swung her to one side, bared his  fighting fangs and growled ominously.  Meriem struggled to escape.  She  struck at the hairy breast and bearded cheek.  She fastened her strong,  white teeth in one shaggy forearm.  The ape cuffed her viciously across  the face, then he had to turn his attention to his fellow who quite  evidently desired the prize for his own.    The captor could not fight to advantage upon the swaying bough,  burdened as he was by a squirming, struggling captive, so he dropped  quickly to the ground beneath.  The other followed him, and here they  fought, occasionally abandoning their duel to pursue and recapture the  girl who took every advantage of her captors' preoccupation in battle  to break away in attempted escape; but always they overtook her, and  first one and then the other possessed her as they struggled to tear  one another to pieces for the prize.    Often the girl came in for many blows that were intended for a hairy  foe, and once she was felled, lying unconscious while the apes,  relieved of the distraction of detaining her by force, tore into one  another in fierce and terrible combat.    Above them screamed the little monkeys, racing hither and thither in a  frenzy of hysterical excitement.  Back and forth over the battle field  flew countless birds of gorgeous plumage, squawking their hoarse cries  of rage and defiance.  In the distance a lion roared.    The larger bull was slowly tearing his antagonist to pieces.  They  rolled upon the ground biting and striking.  Again, erect upon their  hind legs they pulled and tugged like human wrestlers; but always the  giant fangs found their bloody part to play until both combatants and  the ground about them were red with gore.    Meriem, through it all, lay still and unconscious upon the ground.  At  last one found a permanent hold upon the jugular of the other and thus  they went down for the last time.  For several minutes they lay with  scarce a struggle.  It was the larger bull who arose alone from the  last embrace.  He shook himself.  A deep growl rumbled from his hairy  throat.  He waddled back and forth between the body of the girl and  that of his vanquished foe.  Then he stood upon the latter and gave  tongue to his hideous challenge.  The little monkeys broke, screaming,  in all directions as the terrifying noise broke upon their ears.  The  gorgeous birds took wing and fled.  Once again the lion roared, this  time at a greater distance.    The great ape waddled once more to the girl's side.  He turned her over  upon her back, and stooping commenced to sniff and listen about her  face and breast.  She lived.  The monkeys were returning.  They came in  swarms, and from above hurled down insults upon the victor.    The ape showed his displeasure by baring his teeth and growling up at  them.  Then he stooped and lifting the girl to his shoulder waddled off  through the jungle.  In his wake followed the angry mob.          Chapter 11      Korak, returning from the hunt, heard the jabbering of the excited  monkeys.  He knew that something was seriously amiss.  Histah, the  snake, had doubtless coiled his slimy folds about some careless Manu.  The youth hastened ahead.  The monkeys were Meriem's friends.  He would  help them if he could.  He traveled rapidly along the middle terrace.  In the tree by Meriem's shelter he deposited his trophies of the hunt  and called aloud to her.  There was"]]]
