Wilkinson enumerates  seventy-three principal divinities, and Birch sixty-three; but there  were some hundreds of lesser gods, discharging peculiar functions and  presiding over different localities. Every town had its guardian deity,  to whom prayers or sacrifices were offered by the priests. The more  complicated the religious rites the more firmly cemented was the power  of the priestly caste, and the more indispensable were priestly services  for the offerings and propitiations.    Of these Egyptian deities there were eight of the first rank; but the  list of them differs according to different writers, since in the great  cities different deities were worshipped. These were Ammon--the  concealed god,--the sovereign over all (corresponding to the Jupiter of  the Romans), whose sacred city was Thebes. At a later date this god was  identified with Ammon Ra, the physical sun. Ra was the sun-god,  especially worshipped at Heliopolis,--the symbol of light and heat.  Kneph was the spirit of God moving over the face of the waters, whose  principal seat of worship was in Upper Egypt. Phtha was a sort of  artisan god, who made the sun, moon, and the earth, \"the father of  beginnings;\" his sign was the scarabaeus, or beetle, and his patron city  was Memphis. Khem was the generative principle presiding over the  vegetable world,--the giver of fertility and lord of the harvest. These  deities are supposed to have represented spirit passing into matter and  form,--a process of divine incarnation.    But the most popular deity was Osiris. His image is found standing on  the oldest monument, a form of Ra, the light of the lower world, and  king and judge of Hades. His worship was universal throughout Egypt, but  his chief temples were at Abydos and Philae. He was regarded as mild,  beneficent, and good. In opposition to him were Set, malignant and evil,  and Bes, the god of death. Isis, the wife and sister of Osiris, was a  sort of sun goddess, representing the productive power of Nature. Khons  was the moon god. Maut, the consort of Ammon, represented Nature. Sati,  the wife of Kneph, bore a resemblance to Juno. Nut was the goddess of  the firmament; Ma was the goddess of truth; Horus was the mediator  between creation and destruction.    But in spite of the multiplicity of deities, the Egyptian worship  centred in some form upon heat or fire, generally the sun, the most  powerful and brilliant of the forces of Nature. Among all the ancient  pagan nations the sun, the moon, and the planets, under different names,  whether impersonated or not, were the principal objects of worship for  the people. To these temples were erected, statues raised, and  sacrifices made.    No ancient nation was more devout, or more constant to the service of  its gods, than were the Egyptians; and hence, being superstitious, they  were pre-eminently under the control of priests, as the people were in  India. We see, chiefly in India and Egypt, the power of  caste,--tyrannical, exclusive, and pretentious,--and powerful in  proportion to the belief in a future state. Take away the belief in  future existence and future rewards and punishments, and there is not  much religion left. There may be philosophy and morality, but not  religion, which is based on the fear and love of God, and the destiny of  the soul after death. Saint Augustine, in his \"City of God,\" his  greatest work, ridicules all gods who are not able to save the soul, and  all religions where future existence is not recognized as the most  important thing which can occupy the mind of man.    We cannot then utterly despise the religion of Egypt, in spite of the  absurdities mingled with it,--the multiplicity of gods and the doctrine  of metempsychosis,--since it included a distinct recognition of a future  state of rewards and punishments \"according to the deeds done in the  body.\" On this belief rested the power of the priests, who were supposed  to intercede with the deities, and who alone were appointed to offer to  them sacrifices, in order to gain their favor or deprecate their wrath.  The idea of death and judgment was ever present to the thoughts of the  Egyptians, from the highest to the lowest, and must have modified their  conduct, stimulating them to virtue, and restraining them from vice; for  virtue and vice are not revelations,--they are instincts implanted in  the soul. No ancient teacher enjoined the duties based on an immutable  morality with more force than Confucius, Buddha, and Epictetus. Who in  any land or age has ignored the duties of filial obedience, respect to  rulers, kindness to the miserable, protection to the weak, honesty,  benevolence, sincerity, and truthfulness? With the discharge of these  duties, written on the heart, have been associated the favor of the  gods, and happiness in the future world, whatever errors may have crept  into theological dogmas and speculations.    Believing then in a future state, where sin would be punished and virtue  rewarded, and believing in it firmly and piously, the ancient Egyptians  were a peaceful and comparatively moral people. All writers admit their  industry, their simplicity of life, their respect for law, their loyalty  to priests and rulers. Hence there was permanence to their institutions,  for rapine, violence, and revolution were rare. They were not warlike,  although often engaged in war by the command of ambitious kings.  Generally the policy of their government was conservative and pacific.  Military ambition and thirst for foreign conquest were not the peculiar  sins of Egyptian kings; they sought rather to develop national  industries and resources. The occupation of the people was in  agriculture and the useful arts, which last they carried to considerable  perfection, especially in the working of metals, textile fabrics, and  ornamental jewelry. Their grand monuments were not triumphal arches, but  temples and mausoleums. Even the pyramids may have been built to  preserve the bodies of kings until the soul should be acquitted or  condemned, and therefore more religious in their uses than as mere  emblems of pride and power; and when monuments were erected to  perpetuate the fame of princes, their supreme design was to receive the  engraven memorials of the virtuous deeds of kings as fathers of  the people.    The priests, whose business it was to perform religious rites and  ceremonies to the various gods of the Egyptians, were extremely  numerous. They held the highest social rank, and were exempt from taxes.  They were clothed in white linen, which was kept scrupulously clean.  They washed their whole bodies twice a day; they shaved the head, and  wore no beard. They practised circumcision, which rite was of extreme  antiquity, existing in Egypt two thousand four hundred years before  Christ, and at least four hundred years before Abraham, and has been  found among primitive peoples all over the world. They did not make a  show of sanctity, nor were they ascetic like the Brahmans. They were  married, and were allowed to drink wine and to eat meat, but not fish  nor beans, which disturbed digestion. The son of a priest was generally  a priest also. There were grades of rank among the priesthood; but not  more so than in the Roman Catholic Church. The high-priest was a great  dignitary, and generally belonged to the royal family. The king himself  was a priest.    The Egyptian ritual of worship was the most complicated of all rituals,  and their literature and philosophy were only branches of theology.  \"Religious observances,\" says Freeman Clarke, \"were so numerous and so  imperative that the most common labors of daily life could not be  performed without a perpetual reference to some priestly regulation.\"  There were more religious festivals than among any other ancient nation.  The land was covered with temples; and every temple consecrated to a  single divinity, to whom some animal was sacred, supported a large body  of priests. The authorities on Egyptian history, especially Wilkinson,  speak highly, on the whole, of the morals of the priesthood, and of  their arduous and gloomy life of superintending ceremonies, sacrifices,  processions, and funerals. Their life was so full of minute duties and  restrictions that they rarely appeared in public, and their aspect as  well as influence was austere and sacerdotal.    One of the most distinctive features of the Egyptian religion was the  idea of the transmigration of souls,--that when men die; their souls  reappear on earth in various animals, in expiation of their sins. Osiris  was the god before whose tribunal all departed spirits appeared to be  judged. If evil preponderated in their lives, their souls passed into a  long series of animals until their sins were expiated, when the purified  souls, after thousands of years perhaps, passed into their old bodies.  Hence it was the great object of the Egyptians to preserve their mortal  bodies after death, and thus arose the custom of embalming them. It is  difficult to compute the number of mummies that have been found in  Egypt. If a man was wealthy, it cost his family as much as one thousand  dollars to embalm his body suitably to his rank. The embalmed bodies of  kings were preserved in marble sarcophagi, and hidden in gigantic  monuments.    The most repulsive thing in the Egyptian religion was animal-worship. To  each deity some animal was sacred. Thus Apis, the sacred bull of  Memphis, was the representative of Osiris; the cow was sacred to Isis,  and to Athor her mother. Sheep were sacred to Kneph, as well as the  asp. Hawks were sacred to Ra; lions were emblems of Horus, wolves of  Anubis, hippopotami of Set. Each town was jealous of the honor of its  special favorites among the gods.    \"The worst form of this animal worship,\" says Rawlinson, \"was the belief  that a deity absolutely became incarnate in an individual animal, and so  remained until the animal's death."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10478"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 02: Jewish Heroes and Prophets (#3)"],[1,"this  period. With the growth of cities and the power of kings idolatry  increased, and the knowledge of the true God declined. From such  influences it was necessary that Abram should be removed if he was to  found a nation with a monotheistic belief. So, in obedience to a call  from God, he left the city of his birthplace, and went toward the land  of Canaan and settled in Haran, where he remained until the death of his  father, who it seems had accompanied him in his wanderings, but was  probably too infirm to continue the fatiguing journey. Abram, now the  head of his tribe and doubtless a powerful chieftain, received another  call, and with it the promise that he should be the founder of a great  nation, and that in him all the families of the earth should be blessed.    What was that call, coupled with such a magnificent and cheering  promise? It was the voice of God commanding Abram to leave country and  kindred and go to a country utterly unknown to him, not even indicated  to him, but which in due time should be revealed to him. He is not  called to repudiate idolatry, but by divine command to go to an unknown  country. He must have been already a believer in the One Supreme God, or  he would not have felt the command to be imperative. Unless his belief  had been monotheistic, we must attribute to him a marvellous genius and  striking originality of mind, together with an independence of character  still more remarkable; for it requires not only original genius to soar  beyond popular superstitions, but also great force of will and lofty  intrepidity to break away from them,--as when Buddha renounced  Brahmanism, or Socrates ridiculed the Sophists of Attica. Nothing  requires more moral courage than the renunciation of a popular and  generally received religious belief. It was a hard struggle for Luther  to give up the ideas of the Middle Ages in reference to self-expiation.  It is exceedingly rare for any one to be emancipated from the tyranny of  prevailing dogmas.    So, if Abram was not divinely instructed in a way that implies  supernatural illumination, he must have been the most remarkable sage of  all antiquity to found a religion never abrogated by succeeding  revelations, which has lasted from his time to ours, and is to-day  embraced by so large a part of the human race, including Christians,  Mohammedans, and Jews. Abram must have been more gifted than the whole  school of Ionian philosophers united, from Thales downward, since after  three hundred years of speculation and lofty inquiries they only arrived  at the truth that the being who controls the universe must be  intelligent. Even Socrates, Plato, and Cicero--the most gifted men of  classical antiquity--had very indefinite notions of the unity and  personality of God, while Abram distinctly recognized this great truth  even amid universal idolatry and a degrading polytheism.    Yet the Bible recognizes in Abram moral rather than intellectual  greatness. He was distinguished for his faith, and a faith so exalted  and pure that it was accounted unto him for righteousness. His faith in  God was so profound that it was followed by unhesitating obedience to  God's commands. He was ready to go wherever he was sent, instantly,  without conditions or remonstrance.    In obedience to the divine voice then, Abram, after the death of his  father Terah, passed through the land of Canaan unto Sichem, or Shechem,  afterward a city of Samaria. He then went still farther south, and  pitched his tent on a mountain having Bethel on the west and Hai on the  east, and there he built an altar unto the Lord. After this it would  appear that he proceeded still farther to the south, probably near the  northern part of Idumaea.    Wherever Abram journeyed he found the Canaanites--descendants of  Ham--petty tribes or nations, governed by kings no more powerful than  himself. They are supposed in their invasions to have conquered the  aboriginal inhabitants, whose remote origin is veiled in impenetrable  obscurity, but who retained some principles of the primitive religion.  It is even possible that Melchizedek, the unconquered King of Salem, who  blessed Abram, belonged to those original people who were of Semitic  origin. Nevertheless the Canaanites, or Hametic tribes, were at this  time the dominant inhabitants.    Of these tribes or nations the Sidonians, or Phoenicians, were the most  powerful. Next to them, according to Ewald, \"were three nations living  toward the South,--the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites; then  two in the most northerly country conquered by Israel,--the Girgashites  and the Hivites; then four in Phoenicia; and lastly, the most northern  of all, the well known kingdom of Hamath on the Orontes.\" The Jebusites  occupied the country around Jerusalem; the Amorites also dwelt in the  mountainous regions, and were warlike and savage, like the ancient  Highlanders of Scotland. They entrenched themselves in strong castles.  The Hittites, or children of Heth, were on the contrary peaceful, having  no fortified cities, but dwelling in the valleys, and living in  well-ordered communities. The Hivites dwelt in the middle of the  country, and were also peaceful, having reached a considerable  civilization, and being in the possession of the most flourishing inland  cities. The Philistines entered the land at a period subsequent to the  other Canaanites, probably after Abram, coming it is supposed  from Crete.    It would appear that Abram was not molested by these various petty  Canaanitish nations, that he was hospitably received by them, that he  had pleasant relations with them, and even entered into their battles as  an ally or protector. Nor did Abram seek to conquer territory. Powerful  as he was, he was still a pilgrim and a wanderer, journeying with his  servants and flocks wherever the Lord called him; and hence he excited  no jealousy and provoked no hostilities. He had not long been settled  quietly with his flocks and herds before a famine arose in the land, and  he was forced to seek subsistence in Egypt, then governed by the  shepherd kings called Hyksos, who had driven the proud native monarch  reigning at Memphis to the southern part of the kingdom, in the vicinity  of Thebes. Abram was well received at the court of the Pharaohs, until  he was detected in a falsehood in regard to his wife, whom he passed as  his sister. He was then sent away with all that he had, together with  his nephew Lot.    Returning to the land of Canaan, Abram came to the place where he had  before pitched his tent, between Bethel and Hai, unto the altar which he  had some time before erected, and called upon the name of the Lord. But  the land was not rich enough to support the flocks and herds of both  Abram and Lot, and there arose a strife between their respective  herdsmen; so the patriarch and his nephew separated, Lot choosing for  his residence the fertile plain of the Jordan, and Abram remaining in  the land of Canaan. It was while sojourning at Bethel that the Lord  appeared again unto Abram, and promised to him the whole land as a  future possession of his posterity. After that he removed his tent to  the plain of Mamre, near or in Hebron, and again erected an altar to  his God.    Here Abram remained in true patriarchal dignity without further  migrations, abounding in wealth and power, and able to rescue his nephew  Lot from the hands of Chedorlaomer the King of Elam, and from the other  Oriental monarchs who joined his forces, pursuing them even to Damascus.  For this signal act of heroism Abram was blessed by Melchizedek, in the  name of their common lord the most high God. Who was this Prince of  Salem? Was he an earthly potentate ruling an unconquered city of the  aboriginal inhabitants; or was he a mysterious personage, without  father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning nor  end of days, nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God, an  incarnation of the Deity, to repeat the blessing which the patriarch had  already received?    The history of Abram until his supreme trial seems principally to have  been repeated covenants with God, and the promises held out of the  future greatness of his descendants. The greatness of the Israelitish  nation, however, was not to be in political ascendancy, nor in great  attainments in the arts and sciences, nor in cities and fortresses and  chariots and horses, nor in that outward splendor which would attract  the gaze of the world, and thus provoke conquests and political  combinations and grand alliances and colonial settlements, by which the  capital on Zion's hill would become another Rome, or Tyre, or Carthage,  or Athens, or Alexandria,--but quite another kind of greatness. It was  to be moral and spiritual rather than material or intellectual, the  centre of a new religious life, from which theistic doctrines were to go  forth and spread for the healing of the nations,--all to culminate, when  the proper time should come, in the mission of Jesus Christ, and in his  teachings as narrated and propagated by his disciples.    This was the grand destiny of the Hebrew race; and for the fulfilment of  this end they were located in a favored country, separated from other  nations by mountains, deserts, and seas, and yet capable by cultivation  of sustaining a great population, while they were governed by a polity  tending to keep them a distinct, isolated, and peculiar people. To the  descendants of Ham and Japhet were given cities, political power,  material civilization; but in the tents of Shem religion was to dwell.  \"From first to last,\" says Geikie, \"the intellect of the Hebrew dwelt  supremely on the matters of his faith. The triumphs of the pencil or the  chisel he left with contemptuous indifference to Egypt, or Assyria, or  Greece. Nor had the Jew any such interest in religious philosophy as has  marked other people. The Aryan nations, both East and"]]]
