Of these we have frequent notices in the Old Testament, as  of that raised by Jacob at Lug, afterwards named Bethel; a pillar was  also raised by him at the grave of Rachel. The Gentiles set up pillars  for idolatrous purposes. The Paphians worshipped their Venus under the  form of a white pyramid, and the Brachmans the great God under the  figure of a little column of stone. Many large stones are found at this  day in Wales and Cornwall, which are supposed to have been raised by the  Phoenicians and Grecians, who frequently resorted thither for tin and  other metals.    In Ireland some of these large stones have crosses cut on them, supposed  to have been sculptured by Christians, out of compliance with Druidical  prejudices, that the converts from Paganism not easily diverted from  their reverence for these stones, might pay them a kind of justifiable  adoration, when thus appropriated to the use of Christian memorials, by  the sign of the Cross. Some signs of adoration are at this day paid to  such stones, in the Scottish Western Isles; they are called _bowing  stones_. In the Isle of Barra there is one about seven feet high, and  when the inhabitants come near, they take a religious turn round it,  according with ancient Druidical custom.    Stones were raised also as memorials of _civil contracts_; as by Jacob,  in his contract with Laban, when the attendants of the latter raised a  heap, to signify their assent to the treaty. Those conical, pyramidal,  and cylindric stones, perpendicularly raised, which are seen in the  British Isles, were formerly introduced in general, to ascertain the  boundaries of districts. On these, representations of the crucifixion  were frequently cut, and the name of crosses were given to the boundary  stones in general, though remaining without this symbol. Many instances  might be given of these termini. At High Cross, on the intersection of  the Watling Street and Foss Roman roads, there was formerly a pillar  which marked the limits of Warwickshire and Leicestershire--the present  column is of modern date; another distinguished the boundaries of  Asfordby and Frisby, in the latter county. One at Crowland, in the  county of Lincoln, the inscription on which has caused considerable  dispute amongst antiquarians, has been much noticed. A famous one near  Landoris, in Fifeshire, placed, as Camden says, as a boundary between  the districts of Fife and Stathern, was also a place of sanctuary.    Stone pillars, or crosses were also raised to record remarkable events;  as where a battle had been fought, or over persons of distinction slain  therein. Crosses were likewise erected where any particular instance of  mercy had been shown by the Almighty, or where any person had been  murdered by robbers, or had met with a violent death; where the corpse  of any great person had rested on its way to interment, as those  splendid ones erected by Edward I. in memory of his beloved Queen  Elinor; often in churchyards, and in early times at most places of  public concourse; in market-places, perhaps to repress all idea of undue  gain or extortion; and at the meeting of four roads.    Penances were often finished at crosses. Near Stafford stood one called  _Weeping Cross_, from its being a place designated for the expiation of  penances, which concluded with weeping and other signs of contrition. A  great number of sepulchral crosses were erected in Great Britain and  Ireland, soon after prayers for the dead came into use, by the desire of  individuals, at their places of interment, to remind pious people to  pray for their souls.    The ancient practice of consecrating Pagan antiquities to religious  purposes, has been continued to times comparatively modern; thus, Pope  Sixtus V. purified the Antonine column and that of Trajan, dedicating  them to St. Peter and St. Paul, whose statues, of a colossal size, he  placed on their summits. Succeeding Popes followed these examples,  dedicating ancient columns, pillars, and obelisks to different Saints  and Apostles.    A CORRESPONDENT.           *       *       *       *       *        NOTES OF A READER.           *       *       *       *       *      THE LONDON UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE,    No. 1.      It is seldom that we \"turn critics;\" but our very bile rises at the  ill-timed dedication of this work to the King, as the \"first fruits of  the combined exertions of a few of your majesty's subjects, educated  within the GROSSLY misrepresented UNIVERSITY of LONDON.\" It is quite  unnecessary for us to explain _why_ this Dedication deserves the epithet  we have chosen: it stands with the signature of \"the Proprietors,\" and  we hope is not the act of the editors; but for the credit of the  University, the publishers, the proprietors, and editors, we recommend  their friends to cancel the leaf bearing this very offensive  inscription, whether they care or not for the golden opinions of all  sorts of people.    If the present Number be a fair sample of the _London University  Magazine_, we can promise the reader but little amusement in our \"Notes\"  from its pages. It may prove useful enough to the students of the  University, but it wofully lacks the attractive features of a Magazine  for the public; it may suit the library-table, but not the \"excellent  coffee room,\" or the \"retired cigar room\" of the University Hotel. \"On a  general Judgment--A new System of communicating Scientific Information  in a Tabular form--On the Study of the Law and Medicine--On Apoplexy,\"  and the general business of the University, are very grave matters for  little more than 100 pages. \"On the Metamorphosis of Plants,\" by Goethe,  is more attractive; but Magazine readers do not want the lumber of law  and medicine--the dry material of parchment, or the blood and filth of  the physiological chair. How different too, is all this from the  pleasantry and attic wit of \"_The Etonian_,\" into whose volumes we still  dip with undiminished gratification.    As we have enumerated the least attractive of the papers in the London  University Magazine, we ought also to run over the lighter portions of  its pages. These are \"A young head, and, what is still better, a young  heart,\"--discursive enough--\"A Tale of the Irish Rebellion--the Guerilla  Bride, a Poem,\" beginning        \"It is a tale of Spain--Romantic Spain!\"    --and a Sketch of the Irish Exchequer Court. A description of the  University, with a Vignette view, and ground plan, is perhaps, the most  interesting of the whole Number; but as dramatic critics sometimes say  of a new performer, we had rather see him in another character before we  form an estimate of his talents--so we wait for better things from the  London University Magazine.           *       *       *       *       *      THE EDINBURGH JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE, No. 1.      We expected much from the announcement of this work, and are not  disappointed in its first Number. It contains original  papers--scientific Reviews--geographical and natural History  Collections--and an abundance of scientific intelligence--somewhat on  the plan of Mr. Loudon's excellent Magazines. We have not at present  room for extract; but the Number before us will furnish several  interesting Notes for a portion of our next publication. _A Tour in the  Island of Jersey_ is one of the most amusing articles we have read for  some time, and we hope to abridge it for our columns.           *       *       *       *       *      THE FOREIGN REVIEW.      The Eighth Number of this valuable Journal is just published, and its  table of contents is exceedingly attractive. Among these are  Phrenology--a characteristic article on Germany--the French and Italian  Drama--anecdotical papers on Napoleon and General Jackson and the United  States of America, and the History of the Cid. Ours will be a pleasing  task to \"note\" through this Number.           *       *       *       *       *      UNPUBLISHED LINES ON DR. JOHNSON.    _By the late Dr. Wolcot.

To force up one poor nipperkin of water;    Bids ocean labour with tremendous roar,    To heave a cockle-shell upon the shore.    Alike in every theme his pompous art,    Heaven's awful thunder, or a rumbling cart!    _New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      GAS LIGHTS.

The name and address she gave  were false. So that was the end of that business.\"    \"Had any of the servants left you between the time the brooch was lost and  the date of the pawn ticket?\"    \"No.\"    \"Were all your servants at home on the day the brooch was pawned?\"    \"Oh, yes! I made that inquiry myself.\"    \"Very good! What next?\"    \"Yesterday--and this is what made me send for you. My late wife's sister  came here last Tuesday, and we gave her the room from which Mrs. Heath  lost her bracelet. She had with her a very old-fashioned brooch,  containing a miniature of her father, and set in front with three very  fine brilliants and a few smaller stones. Here we are, though, at the  Croft. I'll tell you the rest indoors.\"    Hewitt laid his hand on the baronet's arm. \"Don't pull up, Sir James,\" he  said. \"Drive a little farther. I should like to have a general idea of the  whole case before we go in.\"    \"Very good!\" Sir James Norris straightened the horse's head again and went  on. \"Late yesterday afternoon, as my sister-in-law was changing her dress,  she left her room for a moment to speak to my daughter in her room, almost  adjoining. She was gone no more than three minutes, or five at most, but  on her return the brooch, which had been left on the table, had gone. Now  the window was shut fast, and had not been tampered with. Of course the  door was open, but so was my daughter's, and anybody walking near must  have been heard. But the strangest circumstance, and one that almost makes  me wonder whether I have been awake to-day or not, was that there lay _a  used match_ on the very spot, as nearly as possible, where the brooch had  been--and it was broad daylight!\"    Hewitt rubbed his nose and looked thoughtfully before him. \"Um--curious,  certainly,\" he said, \"Anything else?\"    \"Nothing more than you shall see for yourself. I have had the room locked  and watched till you could examine it. My sister-in-law had heard of your  name, and suggested that you should be called in; so, of course, I did  exactly as she wanted. That she should have lost that brooch, of all  things, in my house is most unfortunate; you see, there was some small  difference about the thing between my late wife and her sister when their  mother died and left it. It's almost worse than the Heaths' bracelet  business, and altogether I'm not pleased with things, I can assure you.  See what a position it is for me! Here are three ladies, in the space of  one year, robbed one after another in this mysterious fashion in my house,  and I can't find the thief! It's horrible! People will be afraid to come  near the place. And I can do nothing!\"    \"Ah, well, we'll see. Perhaps we had better turn back now. By-the-by, were  you thinking of having any alterations or additions made to your house?\"    \"No. What makes you ask?\"    \"I think you might at least consider the question of painting and  decorating, Sir James--or, say, putting up another coach-house, or  something. Because I should like to be (to the servants) the architect--or  the builder, if you please--come to look around. You haven't told any of  them about this business?\"    \"Not a word. Nobody knows but my relatives and Lloyd. I took every  precaution myself, at once. As to your little disguise, be the architect  by all means, and do as you please. If you can only find this thief and  put an end to this horrible state of affairs, you'll do me the greatest  service I've ever asked for--and as to your fee, I'll gladly make it  whatever is usual, and three hundred in addition.\"    Martin Hewitt bowed. \"You're very generous, Sir James, and you may be sure  I'll do what I can. As a professional man, of course, a good fee always  stimulates my interest, although this case of yours certainly seems  interesting enough by itself.\"    \"Most extraordinary! Don't you think so? Here are three persons, all  ladies, all in my house, two even in the same room, each successively  robbed of a piece of jewelry, each from a dressing-table, and a used match  left behind in every case. All in the most difficult--one would say  impossible--circumstances for a thief, and yet there is no clue!\"    \"Well, we won't say that just yet, Sir James; we must see. And we must  guard against any undue predisposition to consider the robberies in a  lump. Here we are at the lodge gate again. Is that your gardener--the man  who left the ladder by the lawn on the first occasion you spoke of?\"    Mr. Hewitt nodded in the direction of a man who was clipping a box border.    \"Yes; will you ask him anything?\"    \"No, no; at any rate, not now. Remember the building alterations. I think,  if there is no objection, I will look first at the room that the  lady--Mrs.----\" Hewitt looked up, inquiringly.    \"My sister-in-law? Mrs. Cazenove. Oh, yes! you shall come to her room at  once.\"    \"Thank you. And I think Mrs. Cazenove had better be there.\"    They alighted, and a boy from the lodge led the horse and dog-cart away.    Mrs. Cazenove was a thin and faded, but quick and energetic, lady of  middle age. She bent her head very slightly on learning Martin Hewitt's  name, and said: \"I must thank you, Mr. Hewitt, for your very prompt  attention. I need scarcely say that any help you can afford in tracing the  thief who has my property--whoever it may be--will make me most grateful.  My room is quite ready for you to examine.\"    The room was on the second floor--the top floor at that part of the  building. Some slight confusion of small articles of dress was observable  in parts of the room.    \"This, I take it,\" inquired Hewitt, \"is exactly as it was at the time the  brooch was missed?\"    \"Precisely,\" Mrs. Cazenove answered. \"I have used another room, and put  myself to some other inconveniences, to avoid any disturbance.\"    Hewitt stood before the dressing-table. \"Then this is the used match,\" he  observed, \"exactly where it was found?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where was the brooch?\"    \"I should say almost on the very same spot. Certainly no more than a very  few inches away.\"    Hewitt examined the match closely. \"It is burned very little,\" he  remarked. \"It would appear to have gone out at once. Could you hear it  struck?\"    \"I heard nothing whatever; absolutely nothing.\"    \"If you will step into Miss Norris' room now for a moment,\" Hewitt  suggested, \"we will try an experiment. Tell me if you hear matches struck,  and how many. Where is the match-stand?\"    The match-stand proved to be empty, but matches were found in Miss Norris'  room, and the test was made. Each striking could be heard distinctly, even  with one of the doors pushed to.    \"Both your own door and Miss Norris' were open, I understand; the window  shut and fastened inside as it is now, and nothing but the brooch was  disturbed?\"    \"Yes, that was so.\"    \"Thank you, Mrs. Cazenove. I don't think I need trouble you any further  just at present. I think, Sir James,\" Hewitt added, turning to the  baronet, who was standing by the door----\"I think we will see the other  room and take a walk outside the house, if you please. I suppose, by the  by, that there is no getting at the matches left behind on the first and  second occasions?\"    \"No,\" Sir James answered. \"Certainly not here. The Scotland Yard man may  have kept his.\"    The room that Mrs. Armitage had occupied presented no peculiar feature. A  few feet below the window the roof of the billiard-room was visible,  consisting largely of skylight. Hewitt glanced casually about the walls,  ascertained that the furniture and hangings had not been materially  changed since the second robbery, and expressed his desire to see the  windows from the outside. Before leaving the room, however, he wished to  know the names of any persons who were known to have been about the house  on the occasions of all three robberies.    \"Just carry your mind back, Sir James,\" he said. \"Begin with yourself, for  instance. Where were you at these times?\"    \"When Mrs. Heath lost her bracelet, I was in Tagley Wood all the  afternoon. When Mrs. Armitage was robbed, I believe I was somewhere about  the place most of the time she was out. Yesterday I was down at the farm.\"  Sir James' face broadened. \"I don't know whether you call those suspicious  movements,\" he added, and laughed.    \"Not at all; I only asked you so that, remembering your own movements, you  might the better recall those of the rest of the household. Was anybody,  to your knowledge--_anybody_, mind--in the house on all three occasions?\"    \"Well, you know, it's quite impossible to answer for all the servants.  You'll only get that by direct questioning--I can't possibly remember  things of that sort. As to the family and visitors--why, you don't suspect  any of them, do you?\"    \"I don't suspect a soul, Sir James,\" Hewitt answered, beaming genially,  \"not a soul. You see, I can't suspect people till I know something about  where they were. It's quite possible there will be independent evidence  enough as it is, but you must help me if you can. The visitors, now. Was  there any visitor here each time--or even on the first and last occasions  only?\"    \"No, not one. And my own sister, perhaps you will be pleased to know, was  only there at the time of the first robbery.\"    \"Just so! And your daughter, as I have gathered, was clearly absent from  the spot each time--indeed, was in company with the party robbed. Your  niece, now?\"    \"Why hang it all, Mr. Hewitt, I can't talk of my niece as a suspected  criminal! The poor girl's under my protection, and I really can't  allow----\"    Hewitt raised his hand, and shook his head deprecatingly.    \"My dear sir, haven't I said that I don't suspect a soul? _Do_ let me know  how the people were distributed, as nearly as possible. Let me see. It was  your, niece, I think, who found that Mrs. Armitage's door was locked--this  door, in fact--on the day she"]]]
