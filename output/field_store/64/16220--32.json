TO DR. SCHADE,--AUGSBURG.    Bonn, 1787. Autumn.    MY MOST ESTEEMED FRIEND,--    I can easily imagine what you must think of me, and I cannot deny that you  have too good grounds for an unfavorable opinion. I shall not, however,  attempt to justify myself, until I have explained to you the reasons why my  apologies should be accepted. I must tell you that from the time I left  Augsburg[1] my cheerfulness, as well as my health, began to decline; the  nearer I came to my native city, the more frequent were the letters from my  father, urging me to travel with all possible speed, as my mother's health  was in a most precarious condition. I therefore hurried forwards as fast as  I could, although myself far from well. My longing once more to see my  dying mother overcame every obstacle, and assisted me in surmounting the  greatest difficulties. I found my mother indeed still alive, but in the  most deplorable state; her disease was consumption, and about seven weeks  ago, after much pain and suffering, she died [July 17]. She was indeed a  kind, loving mother to me, and my best friend. Ah! who was happier than I,  when I could still utter the sweet name of mother, and it was heard? But to  whom can I now say it? Only to the silent form resembling her, evoked by  the power of imagination. I have passed very few pleasant hours since my  arrival here, having during the whole time been suffering from asthma,  which may, I fear, eventually turn to consumption; to this is added  melancholy,--almost as great an evil as my malady itself. Imagine yourself  in my place, and then I shall hope to receive your forgiveness for my long  silence. You showed me extreme kindness and friendship by lending me three  Carolins in Augsburg, but I must entreat your indulgence for a time. My  journey cost me a great deal, and I have not the smallest hopes of earning  anything here. Fate is not propitious to me in Bonn. Pardon my intruding on  you so long with my affairs, but all that I have said was necessary for my  own justification.    I do entreat you not to deprive me of your valuable friendship; nothing do  I wish so much as in any degree to become worthy of your regard. I am, with  all esteem, your obedient servant and friend,    L. V. BEETHOVEN,    _Cologne Court Organist._    [Footnote 1: On his return from Vienna, whither Max Franz had sent him for  the further cultivation of his talents.]      3.    TO THE ELECTOR MAXIMILIAN FRANCIS.[1]    1793.    MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND GRACIOUS PRINCE,--    Some years ago your Highness was pleased to grant a pension to my father,  the Court tenor Van Beethoven, and further graciously to decree that 100 R.  Thalers of his salary should be allotted to me, for the purpose of  maintaining, clothing, and educating my two younger brothers, and also  defraying the debts incurred by our father. It was my intention to present  this decree to your Highness's treasurer, but my father earnestly implored  me to desist from doing so, that he might not be thus publicly proclaimed  incapable himself of supporting his family, adding that he would engage to  pay me the 25 R.T. quarterly, which he punctually did. After his death,  however (in December last), wishing to reap the benefit of your Highness's  gracious boon, by presenting the decree, I was startled to find that my  father had destroyed it.    I therefore, with all dutiful respect, entreat your Highness to renew this  decree, and to order the paymaster of your Highness's treasury to grant me  the last quarter of this benevolent addition to my salary (due the  beginning of February). I have the honor to remain,    Your Highness's most obedient and faithful servant,    LUD. V. BEETHOVEN,    _Court Organist._    [Footnote 1: An electoral decree was issued in compliance with this request  on May 3, 1793.]      4.    TO ELEONORE VON BREUNING,--BONN.    Vienna, Nov. 2, 1793.    MY HIGHLY ESTEEMED ELEONORE, MY DEAREST FRIEND,--    A year of my stay in this capital has nearly elapsed before you receive a  letter from me, and yet the most vivid remembrance of you is ever present  with me. I have often conversed in thought with you and your dear family,  though not always in the happy mood I could have wished, for that fatal  misunderstanding still hovered before me, and my conduct at that time is  now hateful in my sight. But so it was, and how much would I give to have  the power wholly to obliterate from my life a mode of acting so degrading  to myself, and so contrary to the usual tenor of my character!    Many circumstances, indeed, contributed to estrange us, and I suspect that  those tale-bearers who repeated alternately to you and to me our mutual  expressions were the chief obstacles to any good understanding between us.  Each believed that what was said proceeded from deliberate conviction,  whereas it arose only from anger, fanned by others; so we were both  mistaken. Your good and noble disposition, my dear friend, is sufficient  security that you have long since forgiven me. We are told that the best  proof of sincere contrition is to acknowledge our faults; and this is what  I wish to do. Let us now draw a veil over the whole affair, learning one  lesson from it,--that when friends are at variance, it is always better to  employ no mediator, but to communicate directly with each other.    With this you will receive a dedication from me [the variations on \"Se vuol  ballare\"]. My sole wish is that the work were greater and more worthy of  you. I was applied to here to publish this little work, and I take  advantage of the opportunity, my beloved Eleonore, to give you a proof of  my regard and friendship for yourself, and also a token of my enduring  remembrance of your family. Pray then accept this trifle, and do not forget  that it is offered by a devoted friend. Oh! if it only gives you pleasure,  my wishes will be fulfilled. May it in some degree recall the time when I  passed so many happy hours in your house! Perhaps it may serve to remind  you of me till I return, though this is indeed a distant prospect. Oh! how  we shall then rejoice together, my dear Eleonore! You will, I trust, find  your friend a happier man, all former forbidding, careworn furrows smoothed  away by time and better fortune.    When you see B. Koch [subsequently Countess Belderbusch], pray say that it  is unkind in her never once to have written to me. I wrote to her twice,  and three times to Malchus (afterwards Westphalian Minister of Finance),  but no answer. Tell her that if she does not choose to write herself, I beg  that she will at least urge Malchus to do so. At the close of my letter I  venture to make one more request--I am anxious to be so fortunate as again  to possess an Angola waistcoat knitted by your own hand, my dear friend.  Forgive my indiscreet request; it proceeds from my great love for all that  comes from you; and I may privately admit that a little vanity is connected  with it, namely, that I may say I possess something from the best and most  admired young lady in Bonn. I still have the one you were so good as to  give me in Bonn; but change of fashion has made it look so antiquated, that  I can only treasure it in my wardrobe as your gift, and thus still very  dear to me. You would make me very happy by soon writing me a kind letter.  If mine cause you any pleasure, I promise you to do as you wish, and write  as often as it lies in my power; indeed everything is acceptable to me that  can serve to show you how truly I am your admiring and sincere friend,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.    P.S. The variations are rather difficult to play, especially the shake in  the _Coda_; but do not be alarmed at this, being so contrived that you only  require to play the shake, and leave out the other notes, which also occur  in the violin part. I never would have written it in this way, had I not  occasionally observed that there was a certain individual in Vienna who,  when I extemporized the previous evening, not unfrequently wrote down next  day many of the peculiarities of my music, adopting them as his own [for  instance, the Abbe Gelinek]. Concluding, therefore, that some of these  things would soon appear, I resolved to anticipate this. Another reason  also was to puzzle some of the pianoforte teachers here, many of whom are  my mortal foes; so I wished to revenge myself on them in this way, knowing  that they would occasionally be asked to play the variations, when these  gentlemen would not appear to much advantage.    BEETHOVEN.      5.    TO ELEONORE VON BREUNING,--BONN.    The beautiful neckcloth, embroidered by your own hand, was the greatest  possible surprise to me; yet, welcome as the gift was, it awakened within  me feelings of sadness. Its effect was to recall former days, and to put me  to shame by your noble conduct to me. I, indeed, little thought that you  still considered me worthy of your remembrance.    Oh! if you could have witnessed my emotions yesterday when this incident  occurred, you would not think that I exaggerate in saying that such a token  of your recollection brought tears to my eyes, and made me feel very sad.  Little as I may deserve favor in your eyes, believe me, my dear _friend_,  (let me still call you so,) I have suffered, and still suffer severely from  the privation of your friendship. Never can I forget you and your dear  mother. You were so kind to me that your loss neither can nor will be  easily replaced. I know what I have forfeited, and what you were to me, but  in order to fill up this blank I must recur to scenes equally painful for  you to hear and for me to detail.    As a slight requital of your kind _souvenir_, I take the liberty to send  you some variations, and a Rondo with violin accompaniment.

Yet all his  previous agony was surpassed when he was being brought to, and the blood  began to circulate freely again. A last ignominy, and one strangely  dreaded by some of the most hardened criminals, was hanging in irons.  When life was extinct the corpse was placed in a sort of iron cage and  thus suspended from a gibbet, usually by the highway or near the place  where the crime had been committed. There it hung until it fell to  pieces from the effects of Time and the weather, and only a few hideous  bones and scraps of dried flesh remained as evidence of the strong hand  of the Law.          With the exception of minor alterations in punctuation and spellings  this book is a complete reprint of three volumes printed and sold by  John Osborn, at the Golden Ball, in Paternoster Row, 1735.    A. L. H.          LIVES OF THE CRIMINALS    VOLUME ONE          THE PREFACE      _The clemency of the Law of England is so great that it does not take  away the life of any subject whatever, but in order to the preservation  of the rest both by removing the offender from a possibility of  multiplying his offences, and by the example of his punishment intending  to deter others from such crimes as the welfare of society requires  should be punished with the utmost severity of the Law. My intention in  communicating to the public the lives of those who, for about a dozen  years past have been victims to their own crimes, is to continue to  posterity the good effects of such examples, and by a recital of their  vices to warn those who become my readers from ever engaging in those  paths which necessarily have so fatal an end. In the work itself I have,  as well as I am able, painted in a proper light those vices which induce  men to fall into those courses which are so justly punished by the  Legislature._    _I flatter myself that however contemptible the_ Lives of the Criminals,  _etc., may seem in the eyes of those who affect great wisdom and put on  the appearance of much learning, yet it will not be without its uses  amongst the middling sort of people, who are glad to take up with books  within the circle of their own comprehension. It ought to be the care of  all authors to treat their several subjects so that while they are read  for the sake of amusement they may, as it were imperceptibly, convey  notions both profitable and just. The adventures of those who, for the  sake of supplying themselves with money for their debaucheries, have  betaken themselves to the desperate trade of knights of the road, often  have in them circumstances diverting enough and such as serve to show us  what sort of amusements they are by which vice betrays us to ruin, and  how the fatal inclination to gratify our passions hurries us finally to  destruction._    _I would not have my readers imagine however, because I talk of  rendering books of this kind useful, that I have thrown out any part of  what may be styled interesting. On the contrary, I have carefully  preserved this and as far as the subject would give me leave, improved  it, but with this caution always, that I have set forth the  entertainments of vice in their proper colours, lest young people might  be led to take them for innocent diversions, and from figures not  uncommon in modern authors, learn to call lewdness gallantry, and the  effects of unbridled lust the starts of too warm an imagination. These  are notions which serve to cheat the mind and represent as the road of  pleasure that which is indeed the highway to the gallows. This, I  conceived, was the use proper to be made of the lives, or rather the  deaths of malefactors, and if I have done no other good in writing them,  I shall have at least this satisfaction, that I have preserved them from  being presented to the world in such a dress as might render the_  Academy of Thieving _their proper title, a thing once practised before,  and if one may guess from the general practice of mankind, might  probably have been attempted again, with success. How a different method  will fare in the world, time only can determine, and to that I leave it.  Yet considering the method in which I treat this subject, I readily  forsaw one objection which occasioned my writing so long a preface as  this, in order that it might be fully obviated._    _Though in the body of the work itself I have carefully traced the rise  of those corrupt inclinations which bring men to the committing of facts  within the cognizance of the Law, it still remains necessary that my  readers also become acquainted, at least in general, with what those  facts are which are so severely punished. In doing this I shall not  speak of matters in the style of a lawyer, but preserve the same  plainness of language which, as I thought it the most proper, I have  endeavoured throughout the whole piece._    _The order of things requires that I should first of all take notice how  the Law comes to have a right of punishing those who live under it with  Death or other grievous penalties, and this in a few words arises thus.  We enter into society for the sake of protection, and as this renders  certain laws necessary, we are justly concluded by them in other cases  for the protection of others; but of all the criminal institutions which  have been settled in any nation, never was any more just, more  reasonable, or fuller of clemency, than that which is called the Crown  Law in England. In speaking of this it may not be improper to explain  the meaning of that term, which seems to take its rise from the  conclusion of indictments, which run always_ contra pacem dicti domini  regis, coronam et dignitatem suam _(against the peace of our Sovereign  Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity) and therefore, as the Crown is  always the prosecutor against such offenders, the Law which creates the  offence is with propriety enough styled the Crown Law._    _The first head of Crown Law is that which concerns offences committed  against God, and anciently there were three which were capital, viz.,  heresy, witchcraft and sodomy; but the law passed in the reign of King  Charles the Second for taking away the writ_ de Haeretica comburendo,  _leaves the first not now punishable with death, even in its highest  degree. However, by a statute made in the reign of King William, persons  educated in the Christian religion who are convicted of denying the  Trinity, the Christian religion, or the authority of the Scriptures, are  for the first offence to be adjudged incapable of office, for the second  to be disabled from suing in any action, and over and above other  incapacities to suffer three years' imprisonment. As to witchcraft, it  was formerly punished in the same manner as heresy. In the time of  Edward the Third, one taken with the head and face of a dead man and a  book of sorcery about him, was brought into the King's Bench, and only  sworn that he would not thenceforth be a sorcerer, and so dismissed, the  head, however, being burnt at his charge. There was a law made against  conjurations, enchantments and witchcraft, in the days of Queen  Elizabeth, but it stands repealed by a statute of King James's time,  which is the law whereon all proceedings at this day are founded. By  this law, any person invoking or conjuring any evil spirit, covenanting  with, employing, feeding, or rewarding them, or taking up any dead  person out of their grave, or any part of them, and making use of it in  any witchcraft, sorcery, etc., shall suffer death as a felon, without  benefit of clergy, and this whether the spirits appear, or whether the  charm take effect or no. By the same statute those who take upon them by  witchcraft, etc., to tell where treasure is hid, or things lost or  stolen should be found, or to engage unlawful love, shall suffer for the  first offence a year's imprisonment, and stand in the pillory once every  quarter in that year six hours, and if guilty a second time, shall  suffer death; even though such discoveries should prove false, or  charms, etc., should have no effect. Executions upon this Act were  heretofore frequent, but of late years, prosecutions on these heads in  which vulgar opinion often goes a great way have been much discouraged  and discontinued. As for the last head it remains yet capital, by virtue  of a statute made in the reign of Henry VIII, which had been repealed in  the first of Queen Mary, and was revived in the fifth of Queen  Elizabeth, by which statute, after reciting that the laws then in being  in this realm were not sufficient for punishing that detestable vice, it  is enacted that such crimes for the future, whether committed with  mankind or beasts, should be punished as felonies without benefit of  clergy._    _It is wide of my purpose to dwell any longer on those crimes which are  by the laws styled properly against God, seeing none of the persons  mentioned in the following work were executed for doing anything against  them. Let us therefore pass on to the second great branch of the Crown  Law, viz., offences immediately against the King, and these are either  treasons or felonies. Of treasons there are four kinds, all settled by  the Statute of the 25th of Edward the Third. The two latter only, viz.,  offences against the King's great or privy seal, and offences in  counterfeiting money, have anything to do with our present design, and  therefore we shall speak particularly of them. Not only the persons who  actually counterfeit those seals, but even the aiders and consenters to  such counterfeiting, are within the Act, and by a statute made in the  reign of Queen Mary, counterfeiting the sign manual or privy signet, is  also made high treason. By the same statute of Edward the Third, the  making of false money, or the bringing it into this realm, in deceit of  our Lord the King and his people, was also declared to be high treason,  but this Act being found insufficient, clippers being not"]]]
