I recalled all I had ever heard about  Wiyaka-Napbina; and I tried to assure myself that though he might pass  near by, he would not come to our wigwam because there was no little  girl around our grounds.    Just then, from without a hand lifted the canvas covering of the  entrance; the shadow of a man fell within the wigwam, and a large  roughly moccasined foot was planted inside.    For a moment I did not dare to breathe or stir, for I thought that could  be no other than Wiyaka-Napbina. The next instant I sighed aloud in  relief. It was an old grandfather who had often told me Iktomi legends.    \"Where is your mother, my little grandchild?\" were his first words.    \"My mother is soon coming back from my aunt's tepee,\" I replied.    \"Then I shall wait awhile for her return,\" he said, crossing his feet  and seating himself upon a mat.    At once I began to play the part of a generous hostess. I turned to my  mother's coffeepot.    Lifting the lid, I found nothing but coffee grounds in the bottom. I set  the pot on a heap of cold ashes in the centre, and filled it half full  of warm Missouri River water. During this performance I felt conscious  of being watched. Then breaking off a small piece of our unleavened  bread, I placed it in a bowl. Turning soon to the coffeepot, which would  never have boiled on a dead fire had I waited forever, I poured out a  cup of worse than muddy warm water. Carrying the bowl in one hand and  cup in the other, I handed the light luncheon to the old warrior. I  offered them to him with the air of bestowing generous hospitality.    \"How! how!\" he said, and placed the dishes on the ground in front of his  crossed feet. He nibbled at the bread and sipped from the cup. I sat  back against a pole watching him. I was proud to have succeeded so well  in serving refreshments to a guest all by myself. Before the old warrior  had finished eating, my mother entered. Immediately she wondered where I  had found coffee, for she knew I had never made any, and that she had  left the coffeepot empty. Answering the question in my mother's eyes,  the warrior remarked, \"My granddaughter made coffee on a heap of dead  ashes, and served me the moment I came.\"    They both laughed, and mother said, \"Wait a little longer, and I shall  build a fire.\" She meant to make some real coffee. But neither she nor  the warrior, whom the law of our custom had compelled to partake of my  insipid hospitality, said anything to embarrass me. They treated my  best judgment, poor as it was, with the utmost respect. It was not till  long years afterward that I learned how ridiculous a thing I had done.          V.    THE DEAD MAN'S PLUM BUSH.      One autumn afternoon many people came streaming toward the dwelling of  our near neighbor. With painted faces, and wearing broad white bosoms of  elk's teeth, they hurried down the narrow footpath to Haraka Wambdi's  wigwam. Young mothers held their children by the hand, and half pulled  them along in their haste. They overtook and passed by the bent old  grandmothers who were trudging along with crooked canes toward the  centre of excitement. Most of the young braves galloped hither on their  ponies. Toothless warriors, like the old women, came more slowly, though  mounted on lively ponies. They sat proudly erect on their horses. They  wore their eagle plumes, and waved their various trophies of former  wars.    In front of the wigwam a great fire was built, and several large black  kettles of venison were suspended over it. The crowd were seated about  it on the grass in a great circle. Behind them some of the braves stood  leaning against the necks of their ponies, their tall figures draped in  loose robes which were well drawn over their eyes.    Young girls, with their faces glowing like bright red autumn leaves,  their glossy braids falling over each ear, sat coquettishly beside their  chaperons. It was a custom for young Indian women to invite some older  relative to escort them to the public feasts. Though it was not an iron  law, it was generally observed.    Haraka Wambdi was a strong young brave, who had just returned from his  first battle, a warrior. His near relatives, to celebrate his new rank,  were spreading a feast to which the whole of the Indian village was  invited.    Holding my pretty striped blanket in readiness to throw over my  shoulders, I grew more and more restless as I watched the gay throng  assembling. My mother was busily broiling a wild duck that my aunt had  that morning brought over.    \"Mother, mother, why do you stop to cook a small meal when we are  invited to a feast?\" I asked, with a snarl in my voice.    \"My child, learn to wait. On our way to the celebration we are going to  stop at Chanyu's wigwam. His aged mother-in-law is lying very ill, and  I think she would like a taste of this small game.\"    Having once seen the suffering on the thin, pinched features of this  dying woman, I felt a momentary shame that I had not remembered her  before.    On our way I ran ahead of my mother and was reaching out my hand to pick  some purple plums that grew on a small bush, when I was checked by a low  \"Sh!\" from my mother.    \"Why, mother, I want to taste the plums!\" I exclaimed, as I dropped my  hand to my side in disappointment.    \"Never pluck a single plum from this brush, my child, for its roots are  wrapped around an Indian's skeleton. A brave is buried here. While he  lived he was so fond of playing the game of striped plum seeds that, at  his death, his set of plum seeds were buried in his hands. From them  sprang up this little bush.\"    Eyeing the forbidden fruit, I trod lightly on the sacred ground, and  dared to speak only in whispers until we had gone many paces from it.  After that time I halted in my ramblings whenever I came in sight of the  plum bush. I grew sober with awe, and was alert to hear a  long-drawn-out whistle rise from the roots of it. Though I had never  heard with my own ears this strange whistle of departed spirits, yet I  had listened so frequently to hear the old folks describe it that I knew  I should recognize it at once.    The lasting impression of that day, as I recall it now, is what my  mother told me about the dead man's plum bush.          VI.    THE GROUND SQUIRREL.      In the busy autumn days my cousin Warca-Ziwin's mother came to our  wigwam to help my mother preserve foods for our winter use. I was very  fond of my aunt, because she was not so quiet as my mother. Though she  was older, she was more jovial and less reserved. She was slender and  remarkably erect. While my mother's hair was heavy and black, my aunt  had unusually thin locks.    Ever since I knew her she wore a string of large blue beads around her  neck,--beads that were precious because my uncle had given them to her  when she was a younger woman. She had a peculiar swing in her gait,  caused by a long stride rarely natural to so slight a figure. It was  during my aunt's visit with us that my mother forgot her accustomed  quietness, often laughing heartily at some of my aunt's witty remarks.    I loved my aunt threefold: for her hearty laughter, for the cheerfulness  she caused my mother, and most of all for the times she dried my tears  and held me in her lap, when my mother had reproved me.    Early in the cool mornings, just as the yellow rim of the sun rose above  the hills, we were up and eating our breakfast. We awoke so early that  we saw the sacred hour when a misty smoke hung over a pit surrounded by  an impassable sinking mire. This strange smoke appeared every morning,  both winter and summer; but most visibly in midwinter it rose  immediately above the marshy spot. By the time the full face of the sun  appeared above the eastern horizon, the smoke vanished. Even very old  men, who had known this country the longest, said that the smoke from  this pit had never failed a single day to rise heavenward.    As I frolicked about our dwelling I used to stop suddenly, and with a  fearful awe watch the smoking of the unknown fires. While the vapor was  visible I was afraid to go very far from our wigwam unless I went with  my mother.    From a field in the fertile river bottom my mother and aunt gathered an  abundant supply of corn. Near our tepee they spread a large canvas upon  the grass, and dried their sweet corn in it. I was left to watch the  corn, that nothing should disturb it. I played around it with dolls made  of ears of corn. I braided their soft fine silk for hair, and gave them  blankets as various as the scraps I found in my mother's workbag.    There was a little stranger with a black-and-yellow-striped coat that  used to come to the drying corn. It was a little ground squirrel, who  was so fearless of me that he came to one corner of the canvas and  carried away as much of the sweet corn as he could hold. I wanted very  much to catch him and rub his pretty fur back, but my mother said he  would be so frightened if I caught him that he would bite my fingers. So  I was as content as he to keep the corn between us. Every morning he  came for more corn. Some evenings I have seen him creeping about our  grounds; and when I gave a sudden whoop of recognition he ran quickly  out of sight.    When mother had dried all the corn she wished, then she sliced great  pumpkins into thin rings; and these she doubled and linked together  into long chains. She hung them on a pole that stretched between two  forked posts. The wind and sun soon thoroughly dried the chains of  pumpkin. Then she packed them away in a case of thick and stiff  buckskin.    In the sun and wind she also dried many wild fruits,--cherries, berries,  and plums. But chiefest among my early recollections of autumn is that  one of the corn drying and the ground squirrel.    I have few memories of winter days at this period of my life, though  many of the summer. There is one only which I can recall.    Some missionaries gave me a little bag of marbles."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10380"],[0,"Bible Stories and Religious Classics (#3)"],[1,"and said: Adam, where art thou?  Calling him in blaming him and not as knowing where he was, but as who  said: Adam, see in what misery thou art. Which answered: I have hid me,  Lord, for I am naked. Our Lord said: Who told thee that thou wert naked,  but that thou hast eaten of the tree forbidden? He then not meekly  confessing his trespass, but laid the fault on his wife, and on him as  giver of the woman to him, and said: The woman that thou gavest to me as  a fellow, gave to me of the tree, and I ate thereof. And then our Lord  said to the woman: Why didst thou so? Neither she accused herself, but  laid the sin on the serpent, and privily she laid the fault on the maker  of him. The serpent was not demanded, for he did it not of himself, but  the devil by him.    And our Lord, cursing them, began at the serpent, keeping an order and  congruous number of curses. The serpent was the first and sinned most,  for he sinned in three things. The woman next and sinned less than he,  but more than the man, for she sinned in two things. The man sinned last  and least, for he sinned but in one. The serpent had envy, he lied, and  deceived, for these three he had three curses. Because he had envy at  the excellence of man, it was said to him: Thou shalt go and creep on  thy breast; because he lied he is punished in his mouth, when it was  said: Thou shalt eat earth all the days of thy life. Also he took away  his voice and put venom in his mouth. And because he deceived, it was  said: I shall put enmity between thee and woman, and thy seed and her  seed. She shall break thy head, etc. In two things the woman sinned, in  pride and eating the fruit. Because she sinned in pride, he meeked her,  saying: Thou shalt be under the power of man, and he shall have lordship  over thee, and he shall put thee to affliction. Now is she subject to a  man by condition and dread, which before was but subject by love; and  because she sinned in the fruit, she is punished in her fruit, when it  was said to her: Thou shalt bring forth children in sorrow; in the pain  of sorrow standeth the curse, but in bringing forth of children is a  blessing. And so, in punishing, God forgat not to have mercy. And  because Adam sinned but only in eating of the fruit, therefore he was  punished in seeking his meat, as it is said to him: Accursed be the  earth in thy work, that is to say for thy work of thy sin, for which is  made that the earth that brought forth good and wholesome fruits  plenteously, from henceforth shall bring forth but seldom, and also none  without man's labor, and also sometime weeds, briars, and thorns shall  grow. And he added: Thereto shalt thou eat herbs of the earth, as who  saith thou shalt be like a beast or jument. He cursed the earth because  the trespass was of the fruit of the earth and not of the water. He  added thereto to him of labor: In the sweat of thy cheer [face] thou  shalt eat thy bread unto the time thou return again into the earth; that  is to say till thou die, for thou art earth, and into earth thou shalt  go again.    Then Adam, wailing and sorrowing the misery that was to come of his  posterity, named his wife Eve, which is to say, mother of all living  folk. Then God made to Adam and Eve two leathern coats of the skins of  dead beasts, to the end that they bare with them the sign of mortality,  and said: Lo, Adam is made as one of us, knowing good and evil, now lest  he put his hand and take of the tree of life and live ever, as who  saith: beware and cast him out, lest he take and eat of the tree of  life. And so he was cast out of Paradise, and set in the field of  Damascus where as he was made and taken from, for to work and labor  there. And our Lord set Cherubim to keep Paradise of delight with a  burning sword and pliant, to the end that none should enter there ne  come to the tree of life.    After then that Adam was cast out of Paradise and set in the world, he  engendered Cain, the fifteenth year after he was made, and his sister  Calmana; but after another fifteen years was Abel born, and his sister  Delbora.    When Adam was an hundred and thirty years of age, Cain slew Abel his  brother. Truth it is, after many days Cain and Abel offered sacrifice  and gifts unto God. It is to be believed that Adam taught his sons to  offer to God their tithes and first fruits. Cain offered fruits, for he  was a ploughman and tiller of earth, and Abel offered milk and the first  of the lambs, Moses saith, of the fattest of the flock. And God beheld  the gifts of Abel, for he and his sacrifices were acceptable to our  Lord; and as to Cain his sacrifices, God beheld them not, for they were  not to him acceptable, he offered withies and thorns. And as some  doctors say, fire came from heaven and lighted the sacrifice of Abel,  and the gifts of Cain pleased not our Lord, for the sacrifice would not  belight nor burn clear in the light of God. Whereof Cain had great envy  unto his brother Abel, which arose against him and slew him. And our  Lord said to him: Where is Abel thy brother? He answered and said: I wot  never, am I keeper of my brother? Then our Lord said: What hast thou  done? The voice of the blood of thy brother crieth to thee from the  earth, wherefore thou art cursed, and accursed be the earth that  received the blood of thy brother by his mouth of thy hands. When thou  shalt work and labor the earth it shall bring forth no fruit, but thou  shalt be fugitive, vagabond, and void on the earth. This Cain deserved  well to be cursed, knowing the pain of the first trespass of Adam, yet  he added thereto murder and slaughter of his brother.    Then Cain, dreading that beasts should devour him, or if he went forth  he should be slain of the men, or if he dwelt with them, they would slay  him for his sin, damned himself, and in despair said: My wickedness is  more than I can deserve to have forgiveness, whoso find me shall slay  me. This he said of dread, or else wishing, as who said, would God he  would slay me. Then our Lord said: Nay not so, thou shalt die, but not  soon, for whosoever slayeth Cain shall be punished seven sithes more,  for he should deliver him from dread, from labor and misery, and added  that he should be punished personally sevenfold more. This punition  shall endure to him in pain unto the seventh, Lameth, whosomever shall  slay Cain shall loose seven vengeances. Some hold that his pain endured  unto the seventh generation, for he committed seven sins. He departed  not truly, he had envy to his brother, he wrought guilefully, he slew  his brother falsely, he denied it, he despaired and damned, he did no  penance. And after he went into the east, fugitive and vagabond. Cain  knew his wife which bare Enoch, and he made a city and named it Enoch  after the name of his son Enoch. Here it showeth well that this time  were many men, though their generation be not said, whom Cain called to  his city, by whose help he made it, whom he induced to theft and  robbery.    He was the first that walled or made cities; dreading them that he  hurted, for surety he brought his people into the towns. Then Enoch gat  Irad, and Irad Mehujael, and he gat Methusael, and he gat Lameth, which  was the seventh from Adam and worst, for he brought in first bigamy.  This Lameth took two wives, Adah and Zilla; of Adah he gat Jabal which  found first the craft to make folds for shepherds and to change their  pasture, and ordained flocks of sheep, and departed the sheep from the  goats after the quality, the lambs by themselves, and the older by  themselves, and understood the feeding of them after the season of the  year. The name of his brother was Jubal, father of singers in the harp  and organs, not of the instruments, for they were found long after, but  he was the finder of music, that is to say of consonants of accord, such  as shepherds use in their delights and sports. And forasmuch as he heard  Adam prophesy of two judgments by the fire and water, that all things  should be destroyed thereby, and that his craft new found should not  perish, he did do write it in two pillars or columns, one of marble,  another of clay of the earth, to the end that one should endure against  the water, and that other against the fire. Josephus saith that the  pillar of marble is yet in the land of Syria. Of Zilla he begat  Tubal-cain, which found first the craft of smithery and working of iron,  and made things for war, and sculptures and gravings in metal to the  pleasure of the eyes, which he so working, Tubal, tofore said, had  delight in the sound of his hammers, of which he made the consonants and  tunes of accord in his song. Noema, sister of Tubal-cain, found first  the craft of diverse texture.    Lameth was a shooter, and used to shoot at wild beasts, for none use of  the meat of them, but only for to have the skins for their clothing, and  lived so long that he was blind and had a child to lead him. And on a  time by adventure he slew Cain. For Cain was always afeard and hid him  among bushes and briars, and the child that led Lameth had supposed it  had been some wild beast and directed Lameth to shoot thereat, and so,  weening to shoot at a beast, slew Cain. And when he knew that he had  slain Cain, he with his bow slew the child, and thus he slew them both  to his damnation; therefore as the sin of Cain was punished seven  sithes, so was the sin of Lameth seventy sithes and seven. That is to  say, seventy-seven souls that came of Lameth were perished in the deluge  and Noah's flood; also his wife did him much sorrow, and evil-entreated  him. And he being wroth said that he suffered that for his double  homicide and manslaughter, yet nevertheless he feared him by pain,  saying: Why will ye slay me? he shall be more and sorer punished that  slayeth me, than he that slew Cain.    Josephus said that when Abel was slain and Cain fled away, Adam when he  was one hundred and thirty years old engendered Seth"]]]
