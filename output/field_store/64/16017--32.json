When to  these difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction,  instrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the  probable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he learns that time  may be sidereal, mean solar, local, Greenwich, or Washington, and he is  referred to an ephemeris and table of logarithms for data, he becomes  lost in \"confusion worse confounded,\" and gives up in despair, settling  down to the conviction that the simple method of compass surveying is  the best after all, even if not the most accurate.    Having received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I  have thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the  method of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently  clear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make  use of such information.    This will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with  the      DEFINITIONS.    The _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all  celestial objects are projected. Its radius is infinite.    The _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves.    The _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the  earth, or of the celestial sphere.    A _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing  through the axis. All meridians are therefore north and south lines  passing through the poles.    From these definitions it follows that if there were a star exactly at  the pole it would only be necessary to set up an instrument and take a  bearing to it for the meridian. Such not being the case, however, we are  obliged to take some one of the near circumpolar stars as our object,  and correct the observation according to its angular distance from the  meridian at the time of observation.    For convenience, the bright star known as Ursae Minoris or Polaris, is  generally selected. This star apparently revolves about the north pole,  in an orbit whose mean radius is 1 deg. 19' 13\",[1] making the revolution in  23 hours 56 minutes.    [Footnote 1: This is the codeclination as given in the Nautical Almanac.  The mean value decreases by about 20 seconds each year.]    During this time it must therefore cross the meridian twice, once above  the pole and once below; the former is called the _upper_, and the  latter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_. It must also pass  through the points farthest east and west from the meridian. The former  is called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_.    An observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points,  or at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too  complicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.    If the observation were made upon the star at the time of its upper or  lower culmination, it would give the true meridian at once, but this  involves a knowledge of the true local time of transit, or the longitude  of the place of observation, which is generally an unknown quantity; and  moreover, as the star is then moving east or west, or at right angles to  the place of the meridian, at the rate of 15 deg. of arc in about one hour,  an error of so slight a quantity as only four seconds of time would  introduce an error of one minute of arc. If the observation be made,  however, upon either elongation, when the star is moving up or down,  that is, in the direction of the vertical wire of the instrument, the  error of observation in the angle between it and the pole will be  inappreciable. This is, therefore, the best position upon which to make  the observation, as the precise time of the elongation need not be  given. It can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a glance at the  relative positions of the star Alioth, in the handle of the Dipper,  and Polaris (see Fig. 1). When the line joining these two stars is  horizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the  latter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and _vice versa_, thus:    [Illustration]    But since the star at either elongation is off the meridian, it will  be necessary to determine the angle at the place of observation to be  turned off on the instrument to bring it into the meridian. This angle,  called the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the  observer, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be  computed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his  _latitude_ before he can apply it. Let N be the north pole of the  celestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation;  then N S=1 deg. 19' 13\", a constant quantity. The azimuth of Polaris at the  latitude 40 deg. north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60 deg.  north, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle  of the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the  latitude.    We have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_.    Of the several methods for doing this, we shall select the simplest,  preceding it by a few definitions.    A _normal_ line is the one joining the point directly overhead, called  the _zenith_, with the one under foot called the _nadir_.    The _celestial horizon_ is the intersection of the celestial sphere by a  plane passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the  normal.    A _vertical circle_ is one whose plane is perpendicular to the horizon,  hence all such circles must pass through the normal and have the zenith  and nadir points for their poles. The _altitude_ of a celestial object  is its distance above the horizon measured on the arc of a vertical  circle. As the distance from the horizon to the zenith is 90 deg., the  difference, or _complement_ of the altitude, is called the _zenith  distance_, or _co-altitude_.    The _azimuth_ of an object is the angle between the vertical plane  through the object and the plane of the meridian, measured on the  horizon, and usually read from the south point, as 0 deg., through west, at  90, north 180 deg., etc., closing on south at 0 deg. or 360 deg.    These two co-ordinates, the altitude and azimuth, will determine the  position of any object with reference to the observer's place. The  latter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude  referred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates.    The _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator,  and the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian.    We are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to  the latitude of the place of observation_.    Let H P Z Q1, etc., Fig. 2, represent a meridian section of the sphere,  in which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H1  will be the horizon, Q Q1 the equator, H P will be the altitude of P,  and Q1 Z the latitude of Z. These two arcs are equal, for H C Z = P C  Q1 = 90 deg., and if from these equal quadrants the common angle P C Z be  subtracted, the remainders H C P and Z C Q1, will be equal.    To _determine the altitude of the pole_, or, in other words, _the  latitude of the place_.    Observe the altitude of the pole star _when on the meridian_, either  above or below the pole, and from this observed altitude corrected for  refraction, subtract the distance of the star from the pole, or its  _polar distance_, if it was an upper transit, or add it if a lower.  The result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for  ordinary purposes.    The time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with  sufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens. The refraction  is _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by  looking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude. Thus, if the  observer's altitude should be 40 deg. 39' the nearest refraction 01' 07\",  should be subtracted from 40 deg. 37' 00\", leaving 40 deg. 37' 53\" for the  latitude.      TO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS.    As we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the  latitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the  required azimuth. For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical  triangle, Z S P, Fig. 4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the  north pole, and S is Polaris. In this triangle we have given the polar  distance, P S = 10 deg. 19' 13\"; the angle at S = 90 deg.; and the distance Z  P, being the complement of the latitude as found above, or 90 deg.--L.  Substituting these in the formula for the azimuth, we will have sin. Z =  sin. P S / sin P Z or sin. of Polar distance / sin. of co-latitude, from  which, by assuming different values for the co-latitude, we compute the  following table:           AZIMUTH TABLE FOR POINTS BETWEEN 26 deg. and 50 deg.

He was about to proceed, when a man mounted on a fine Moorish  horse, which was covered with sweat and foam, entered the court, and  signifying that he had something of importance to communicate, the king  immediately took up his sandals, which is the signal to strangers to  retire. I accordingly took leave, but desired my boy to stay about the  place, in order to learn something of the intelligence that this  messenger had brought. In about an hour the boy returned, and informed me  that the Bambarra army had left Fooladoo, and was on its march towards  Kaarta; that the man I had seen, who had brought this intelligence, was  one of the scouts or watchmen employed by the king, each of whom has his  particular station, (commonly on some rising ground,) from whence he has  the best view of the country, and watches the motions of the enemy.    In the evening the king sent me a fine sheep; which was very acceptable,  as none of us had tasted victuals during the day. Whilst we were employed  in dressing supper, evening prayers were announced; not by the call of  the priest, as usual, but by beating on drums, and blowing through large  elephants' teeth, hollowed out in such a manner as to resemble  bugle-horns; the sound is melodious, and, in my opinion, comes nearer to  the human voice than any other artificial sound. As the main body of  Daisy's army was, at this juncture, at Kemmoo, the mosques were very much  crowded; and I observed that the disciples of Mahomet composed nearly one  half of the army of Kaarta.    Feb. 13th. At daylight I sent my horse-pistols and holsters as a present  to the king, and being very desirous to get away from a place which was  likely soon to become the seat of war, I begged the messenger to inform  the king, that I wished to depart from Kemmoo as soon as he should find  it convenient to appoint me a guide. In about an hour the king sent his  messenger to thank me for the present, and eight horsemen to conduct me  to Jarra. They told me that the king wished me to proceed to Jarra with  all possible expedition, that they might return before any thing decisive  should happen between the armies of Bambarra and Kaarta; we accordingly  departed forthwith from Kemmoo, accompanied by three of Daisy's sons, and  about two hundred horsemen, who kindly undertook to see me a little way  on my journey.          CHAPTER VIII.    _Journey from Kemmoo to Funingkedy.--Some account of the Lotus.--A youth  murdered by the Moors--interesting scene at his death.--Author passes  through Simbing.--Some particulars concerning Major Houghton,--Author  reaches Jarra--situation of the surrounding states at the period of his  arrival there, and a brief account of the war between Kaarta and  Bambarra._      On the evening of the day of our departure from Kemmoo, (the king's  eldest son and great part of the horsemen having returned,) we reached a  village called Marina, where we slept. During the night some thieves  broke into the hut where I had deposited my baggage, and having cut open  one of my bundles, stole a quantity of beads, part of my clothes, and  some amber and gold; which happened to be in one of the pockets. I  complained to my protectors, but without effect. The next day (Feb. 14th)  was far advanced before we departed from Marina, and we travelled slowly,  on account of the excessive heat, until four o'clock in the afternoon,  when two Negroes were observed sitting among some thorny bushes at a  little distance from the road. The king's people, taking it for granted  that they were runaway slaves, cocked their muskets, and rode at full  speed in different directions through the bushes, in order to surround  them, and prevent their escaping. The Negroes, however, waited with great  composure until we came within bowshot of them, when each of them took  from his quiver a handful of arrows, and putting two between his teeth,  and one in his bow, waved to us with his hand to keep at a distance upon  which one of the king's people called out to the strangers to give some  account of themselves. They said that \"they were natives of Toorda, a  neighbouring village, and had come to that place to gather _tomberongs_.\"  These are small farinaceous berries, of a yellow colour and delicious  taste, which I knew to be the fruit of the _rhamnus lotus_ of Linnaeus.  The Negroes showed us two large baskets full, which they had collected in  the course of the day. These berries are much esteemed by the natives,  who convert them into a sort of bread, by exposing them for some days to  the sun, and afterwards pounding them gently in a wooden mortar, until  the farinaceous part of the berry is separated from the stone. This meal  is then mixed with a little water, and formed into cakes; which, when  dried in the sun, resemble in colour and flavour the sweetest  gingerbread. The stones are afterwards put into a vessel of water, and  shaken about so as to separate the meal which may still adhere to them;  this communicates a sweet and agreeable taste to the water, and, with the  addition of a little pounded millet, forms a pleasant gruel called  _fondi_, which is the common breakfast in many parts of Ludamar, during  the months of February and March. The fruit is collected by spreading a  cloth upon the ground, and beating, the branches with a stick.    The lotus is very common in all the kingdoms which I visited; but is  found in the greatest plenty on the sandy soil of Kaarta, Ludamar, and  the northern parts of Bambarra, where it is one of the most common shrubs  of the country. I had observed the same species at Gambia. The leaves of  the desert shrub are, however, much smaller; and more resembling, in that  particular, those represented in the engraving given by Desfontaines, in  the Memoires de l'Academie Royale des Sciences, 1788, p. 443.    As this shrub is found in Tunis, and also in the Negro kingdoms, and as  it furnishes the natives of the latter with a food resembling bread, and  also with a sweet liquor, which is much relished by them, there can be  little doubt of its being the lotus mentioned by Pliny as the food of  the Lybian Lotophagi. An army may very well have been fed with the bread  I have tasted, made of the meal of the fruit, as is said by Pliny to have  been done in Lybia; and as the taste of the bread is sweet and agreeable,  it is not likely that the soldiers would complain of it.    We arrived in the evening at the village of Toorda; when all the rest of  the king's people turned back except two, who remained with me as guides  to Jarra.    Feb. 15th. I departed from Toorda, and about two o'clock came to a  considerable town called Funingkedy. As we approached the town the  inhabitants were much alarmed; for, as one of my guides wore a turban,  they mistook us for some Moorish banditti. This misapprehension was soon  cleared up, and we were well received by a Gambia Slatee, who resides at  this town, and at whose house we lodged.    Feb. 16th. We were informed that a number of people would go from this  town to Jarra on the day following; and as the road was much infested by  the Moors, we resolved to stay and accompany the travellers. In the  meantime, we were told, that a few days before our arrival, most of the  Bushreens and people of property in Funingkedy had gone to Jarra, to  consult about removing their families and effects to that town, for fear  of the approaching war; and that the Moors, in their absence, had stolen  some of their cattle.    About two o'clock, as I was lying asleep upon a bullock's hide behind the  door of the hut, I was awakened by the screams of women, and a general  clamour and confusion among the inhabitants. At first I suspected that  the Bambarrans had actually entered the town; but observing my boy upon  the top of one of the huts, I called to him to know what was the matter.  He informed me that the Moors were come a second time to steal the  cattle, and that they were now close to the town. I mounted the roof of  the hut, and observed a large herd of bullocks coming towards the town,  followed by five Moors on horseback, who drove the cattle forward with  their muskets. When they had reached the wells, which are close to the  town, the Moors selected from the herd sixteen of the finest beasts, and  drove them off at full gallop.    During this transaction, the townspeople, to the number of five hundred,  stood collected close to the walls of the town; and when the Moors drove  the cattle away, though they passed within pistol shot of them, the  inhabitants scarcely made a show of resistance. I only saw four muskets  fired, which, being loaded with gunpowder of the Negroes' own  manufacture, did no execution. Shortly after this I observed a number of  people supporting a young man upon horseback, and conducting him slowly  towards the town. This was one of the herdsmen, who, attempting to throw  his spear, had been wounded by a shot from one of the Moors. His mother  walked on before, quite frantic with grief, clapping her hands, and  enumerating the good qualities of her son. _Ee maffo fonio_, (he never  told a lie,) said the disconsolate mother, as her wounded son was carried  in at the gate--_Ee maffo fonio abada_, (he never told a lie; no, never.)  When they had conveyed him to his hut, and laid him upon a mat, all the  spectators joined in lamenting his fate, by screaming and howling in the  most piteous manner.    After their grief had subsided a little, I was desired to examine the  wound. I found that the ball had passed quite through his leg, having  fractured both bones a little below the knee. The poor boy was faint from  the loss of blood, and his situation withal so very precarious, that I  could not console his relations with any great hopes of his recovery.  However, to give him a possible chance, I observed to them that it was  necessary to "]]]
