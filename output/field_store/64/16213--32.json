CHAPTER II    INTRODUCTION TO COLORED INKS      My room in the Sherman House, then, as now, one of the most  conveniently located hotels in the business district of Chicago, was  the scene of Eugene Field's first introduction to the use of colored  inks. His exquisitely neat, small, and beautifully legible handwriting  has always been the subject of wondering comment and admiration. He  adopted and perfected that style of chirography deliberately to reduce  the labor of writing to a minimum. And he succeeded, for few pen-men  could exceed him in the rapidity with which he produced \"copy\" for the  printer and none excelled him in sending that copy to the compositor in  a form so free from error as to leave no question where blame for  typographical blunders lay. In over twenty years' experience in  handling copy I have only known one regular writer for the press who  wrote as many words to a sheet as Field. That was David H. Mason, the  tariff expert, whose handwriting was habitually so infinitesimal that  he put more than a column of brevier type matter on a single page,  note-paper size.    Strange to say, the compositors did not complain of this eye-straining  copy, which attracted them by its compactness and stretched out to  nearly half a column in the \"strings\" by which their pay was measured.  From this it may be inferred that there was never any complaint of  Field's manuscript from the most exacting and captious of all newspaper  departments--the composing room.    However, I set out to relate the genesis of Field's use of the colored  inks, with which he not only embellished his correspondence and  presentation copies of his verse, but with which he was wont to  illuminate his copy for the printer. It came about in this way:    In the winter of 1885 Walter Cranston Larned, author of the \"Churches  and Castles of Mediaeval France,\" then the art critic for the News,  contributed to it a series of papers on the Walters gallery in  Baltimore. These attracted no small attention at the time, and were the  subject of animated discussion in art circles in Chicago. They were  twelve in number, and ran along on the editorial page of the News from  February 23d till March 10th. At first we of the editorial staff took  only a passing interest in Mr. Larned's contributions. But one day  Field, Ballantyne, and I, from a discussion of the general value of art  criticism in a daily newspaper, were led to question whether it  conveyed an intelligible impression of the subject, and more  particularly of the paintings commented on, to the ordinary reader. The  point was raised as to the practicability of artists themselves  reproducing any recognizable approach to the original paintings by  following Mr. Larned's verbal descriptions. Thereupon we deliberately  set about, in a spirit of frolic to be sure, to attempt what we each  and all considered a highly improbable feat.    Armed with the best water colors we could find in Abbott's art store,  we converted my bachelor quarters in the Sherman House into an amateur  studio, where we daily labored for an hour or so in producing most  remarkable counterfeits of the masterpieces in Mr. Walters's gallery  as seen through Mr. Larned's text. We were innocent of the first  principles of drawing and knew absolutely nothing about the most  rudimentary use of water colors. Somehow, Field made a worse botch in  mixing and applying the colors than did either Ballantyne or I. They  would never produce the effects intended. He made the most whimsical  drawings, only to obliterate every semblance to his original conception  in the coloring. To prevent his going on a strike, I ransacked Chicago  for colored inks to match those required in the pictures that had been  assigned to him. This inspired him with renewed enthusiasm, and he  devoted himself to the task of realizing Mr. Larned's descriptions in  colored inks with the zest that produces the masterpieces over which  artists and critics rave.    His first work in this line was a reproduction--or shall I call it a  restoration--of Corot's \"St. Sebastian.\" In speaking of this as one of  the noteworthy paintings in the Walters gallery, Mr. Larned had said  that it was a landscape in which the figures were quite subordinate and  seemed merely intended to illustrate the deeper meaning of the painter  in his rendition of nature. According to the critic's detailed  description, it was a forest scene. \"Great trees rise on the right to  the top of the canvas. On the left are also some smaller trees, whose  upper branches reach across and make, with the trees on the right, a  sort of arch through which is seen a wonderful stretch of sky. A rocky  path leads away from the foreground beneath the overhanging trees,  sloping upward until it reaches the crest of a hill beneath the sky.  Just at this point the figures of two retreating horsemen are seen.  These are the men who have been trying to kill St. Sebastian, and have  left him, as they thought, dead in the depth of the forest. In the  immediate foreground lies the figure of the half dead saint, whose  wounds are being dressed by two women. Hovering immediately above this  group, far up among the tree branches, two lovely little angels are  seen holding the palm and crown of the martyr. All the figures are  better painted than is usual with Corot, and the angels are very light  and delicate, both in color and form.\" Mr. Earned quoted from a  celebrated French authority that this was \"the most sincerely religious  picture of the nineteenth century.\" I leave it to the reader if Mr.  Larned's description conveys any such impression. To Field's mind, it  only suggested the grotesque, and his reproduction was a _chef  d'oeuvre_, as he was wont to say. He followed the general outline of  the scene as described above, but made the landscape subordinate to the  figures. The retreating ruffians bore an unmistakable resemblance to  outlawed American cowboys. The saint showed carmine ink traces of  having been most shamefully abused. But the chief interest in the  picture was divided between a lunch-basket in the foreground, from  which protruded a bottle of \"St. Jacob's\" oil, and a brace of vividly  pink cupids hopping about in the tree-tops, rejoicing over the magical  effect of the saintly patent medicine. His treatment of this picture  proved, if it proved anything, that Corot had gone dangerously near the  line where the sublime suggests the ridiculous.    In Fortuny's \"Don Quixote\" Field found a subject that tickled his fancy  and lent itself to his untrammelled sense of the absurd. According to  Mr. Larned, Fortuny's picture--a water-color--in the Walters gallery  was one which represents the immortal knight in the somewhat  undignified occupation of searching for fleas in his clothing. He has  thrown off his doublet and his under garment is rolled down to his  waist, leaving the upper portion of his body nude, excepting the  immense helmet which hides his bent-down head. Both hands grasp the  under garment, and the eyes are evidently turned in eager expectancy  upon the folds which the hands are clasping, in the hope that the  roving tormentor has at last been captured. \"What an astonishing freak  of genius!\" exclaimed Mr. Larned. \"For genius it certainly is. The  color and the drawing of the figure are simply masterly, and the entire  tone of the picture is wonderfully rich; indeed, for a water-color, it  is quite marvellous. This is one of Fortuny's celebrated pictures, but  how the 'Ecole des Beaux Arts' would in the old days have held up its  hands and closed its eyes in holy horror! Possibly an earnest disciple  of Lessing, even, might have a rather dubious feeling about such a  choice of subjects.\"    But it suited Field's pen and colored inks to a T. He entered into  Fortuny's spirit as far as he dared to go and helped it over the edge  of the merely dubious to the unmistakably safe grotesque. His own Don  Quixote was clad in modern costume, from the riding-boots and monster  spurs up to the belt. From that point his emaciated body--a fearfully  and wonderfully articulated semi-skeleton--was nude save for one or two  sporadic hairs. In the place of the traditional helmet, the Don's head  was encased in a garden watering-pot, on the spout of which, and  dominating the entire canvas, as artists say, poised on one foot and  evidently enjoying the sorrowful knight's discomfiture, was the  pestiferous _pulex irritans_.    In the Walters gallery were several pictures of child-life by Frere, in  which, according to Mr. Lamed, \"every little figure is full of  character\"--a fact about which there is no doubt in the accompanying  reproduction of Frere's \"The Little Dressmaker,\" which by some chance  was preserved from those \"artist days.\"    The completed results of our many off-hours of artist life were bound  in a volume which was presented to Mr. Larned at a formal lunch given  in his honor at the Sherman House. The speech of presentation was made  by our friend, \"Colonel\" James S. Norton, in what the rural paragrapher  would have described as \"the most felicitous effort of his life,\" and  the wonderful collection was commended to Mr. Larned's grateful  preservation by the judgment of Mr. Henry Field, whose own choice  selection of paintings is the most valued possession of the Chicago Art  Institute. Mr. Field testified that he recognized everyone of the  amazing reproductions from their resemblance, grotesque in the main, to  the originals in the Walters gallery, with which he was familiar.

Even chess was too poetical for him;  he disliked chess because it was full of knights and castles,  like a poem.  He avowedly preferred the black discs of draughts,  because they were more like the mere black dots on a diagram.  Perhaps the strongest case of all is this:  that only one great English  poet went mad, Cowper.  And he was definitely driven mad by logic,  by the ugly and alien logic of predestination.  Poetry was not  the disease, but the medicine; poetry partly kept him in health.  He could sometimes forget the red and thirsty hell to which his  hideous necessitarianism dragged him among the wide waters and  the white flat lilies of the Ouse.  He was damned by John Calvin;  he was almost saved by John Gilpin.  Everywhere we see that men  do not go mad by dreaming.  Critics are much madder than poets.  Homer is complete and calm enough; it is his critics who tear him  into extravagant tatters.  Shakespeare is quite himself; it is only  some of his critics who have discovered that he was somebody else.  And though St. John the Evangelist saw many strange monsters in  his vision, he saw no creature so wild as one of his own commentators.  The general fact is simple.  Poetry is sane because it floats  easily in an infinite sea; reason seeks to cross the infinite sea,  and so make it finite.  The result is mental exhaustion,  like the physical exhaustion of Mr. Holbein.  To accept everything  is an exercise, to understand everything a strain.  The poet only  desires exaltation and expansion, a world to stretch himself in.  The poet only asks to get his head into the heavens.  It is the logician  who seeks to get the heavens into his head.  And it is his head  that splits.         It is a small matter, but not irrelevant, that this striking  mistake is commonly supported by a striking misquotation.  We have  all heard people cite the celebrated line of Dryden as \"Great genius  is to madness near allied.\"  But Dryden did not say that great genius  was to madness near allied.  Dryden was a great genius himself,  and knew better.  It would have been hard to find a man more romantic  than he, or more sensible.  What Dryden said was this, \"Great wits  are oft to madness near allied\"; and that is true.  It is the pure  promptitude of the intellect that is in peril of a breakdown.  Also people might remember of what sort of man Dryden was talking.  He was not talking of any unworldly visionary like Vaughan or  George Herbert.  He was talking of a cynical man of the world,  a sceptic, a diplomatist, a great practical politician.  Such men  are indeed to madness near allied.  Their incessant calculation  of their own brains and other people's brains is a dangerous trade.  It is always perilous to the mind to reckon up the mind.  A flippant  person has asked why we say, \"As mad as a hatter.\"  A more flippant  person might answer that a hatter is mad because he has to measure  the human head.         And if great reasoners are often maniacal, it is equally true  that maniacs are commonly great reasoners.  When I was engaged  in a controversy with the CLARION on the matter of free will,  that able writer Mr. R.B.Suthers said that free will was lunacy,  because it meant causeless actions, and the actions of a lunatic  would be causeless.  I do not dwell here upon the disastrous lapse  in determinist logic.  Obviously if any actions, even a lunatic's,  can be causeless, determinism is done for.  If the chain of  causation can be broken for a madman, it can be broken for a man.  But my purpose is to point out something more practical.  It was natural, perhaps, that a modern Marxian Socialist should not  know anything about free will.  But it was certainly remarkable that  a modern Marxian Socialist should not know anything about lunatics.  Mr. Suthers evidently did not know anything about lunatics.  The last thing that can be said of a lunatic is that his actions  are causeless.  If any human acts may loosely be called causeless,  they are the minor acts of a healthy man; whistling as he walks;  slashing the grass with a stick; kicking his heels or rubbing  his hands.  It is the happy man who does the useless things;  the sick man is not strong enough to be idle.  It is exactly such  careless and causeless actions that the madman could never understand;  for the madman (like the determinist) generally sees too much cause  in everything.  The madman would read a conspiratorial significance  into those empty activities.  He would think that the lopping  of the grass was an attack on private property.  He would think  that the kicking of the heels was a signal to an accomplice.  If the madman could for an instant become careless, he would  become sane.  Every one who has had the misfortune to talk with people  in the heart or on the edge of mental disorder, knows that their  most sinister quality is a horrible clarity of detail; a connecting  of one thing with another in a map more elaborate than a maze.  If you argue with a madman, it is extremely probable that you will  get the worst of it; for in many ways his mind moves all the quicker  for not being delayed by the things that go with good judgment.  He is not hampered by a sense of humour or by charity, or by the dumb  certainties of experience.  He is the more logical for losing certain  sane affections.  Indeed, the common phrase for insanity is in this  respect a misleading one.  The madman is not the man who has lost  his reason.  The madman is the man who has lost everything except  his reason.         The madman's explanation of a thing is always complete, and often  in a purely rational sense satisfactory.  Or, to speak more strictly,  the insane explanation, if not conclusive, is at least unanswerable;  this may be observed specially in the two or three commonest kinds  of madness.  If a man says (for instance) that men have a conspiracy  against him, you cannot dispute it except by saying that all the men  deny that they are conspirators; which is exactly what conspirators  would do.  His explanation covers the facts as much as yours.  Or if a man says that he is the rightful King of England, it is no  complete answer to say that the existing authorities call him mad;  for if he were King of England that might be the wisest thing for the  existing authorities to do.  Or if a man says that he is Jesus Christ,  it is no answer to tell him that the world denies his divinity;  for the world denied Christ's.         Nevertheless he is wrong.  But if we attempt to trace his error  in exact terms, we shall not find it quite so easy as we had supposed.  Perhaps the nearest we can get to expressing it is to say this:  that his mind moves in a perfect but narrow circle.  A small circle  is quite as infinite as a large circle; but, though it is quite  as infinite, it is not so large.  In the same way the insane explanation  is quite as complete as the sane one, but it is not so large.  A bullet is quite as round as the world, but it is not the world.  There is such a thing as a narrow universality; there is such  a thing as a small and cramped eternity; you may see it in many  modern religions.  Now, speaking quite externally and empirically,  we may say that the strongest and most unmistakable MARK of madness  is this combination between a logical completeness and a spiritual  contraction.  The lunatic's theory explains a large number of things,  but it does not explain them in a large way.  I mean that if you  or I were dealing with a mind that was growing morbid, we should be  chiefly concerned not so much to give it arguments as to give it air,  to convince it that there was something cleaner and cooler outside  the suffocation of a single argument.  Suppose, for instance,  it were the first case that I took as typical; suppose it were  the case of a man who accused everybody of conspiring against him.  If we could express our deepest feelings of protest and appeal  against this obsession, I suppose we should say something like this:  \"Oh, I admit that you have your case and have it by heart,  and that many things do fit into other things as you say.  I admit  that your explanation explains a great deal; but what a great deal it  leaves out!  Are there no other stories in the world except yours;  and are all men busy with your business?  Suppose we grant the details;  perhaps when the man in the street did not seem to see you it was  only his cunning; perhaps when the policeman asked you your name it  was only because he knew it already.  But how much happier you would  be if you only knew that these people cared nothing about you!  How much larger your life would be if your self could become smaller  in it; if you could really look at other men with common curiosity  and pleasure; if you could see them walking as they are in their  sunny selfishness and their virile indifference!  You would begin  to be interested in them, because they were not interested in you.  You would break out of this tiny and tawdry theatre in which your  own little plot is always being played, and you would find yourself  under a freer sky, in a street full of splendid strangers.\"  Or suppose it were the second case of madness, that of a man who  claims the crown, your impulse would be to answer, \"All right!  Perhaps you know that you are the King of England; but why do you care?  Make one magnificent effort and you will be a human being and look  down on all the kings of the earth.\"  Or it might be the third case,  of the madman who called himself Christ.  If we said what we felt,  we should say, \"So you are the Creator and Redeemer of the world:  but what a small world it must be!  What a little heaven you must inhabit,  with angels no bigger than butterflies!  How sad it must be to be God;  and an inadequate God!  Is there really no life fuller and no love  more marvellous than yours; and is it really in your small and"]]]
