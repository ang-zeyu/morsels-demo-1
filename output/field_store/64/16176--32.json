When a bow is bent there is a  compression of the fibres on the inner or concave side and an  elongation of the fibres on the outer or convex side. There is  also a tendency of the various fibres to slide past one another  in a longitudinal direction. If the bow were made of two or more  separate pieces of equal length it would be noted on bending  that slipping occurred along the surfaces of contact, and that  the ends would no longer be even. If these pieces were securely  glued together they would no longer slip, but the tendency to do  so would exist just the same. Moreover, it would be found in the  latter case that the bow would be much harder to bend than where  the pieces were not glued together--in other words, the  _stiffness_ of the bow would be materially increased.    ~Stiffness~ is the property by means of which a body acted upon  by external forces tends to retain its natural size and shape,  or resists deformation. Thus a material that is difficult to  bend or otherwise deform is stiff; one that is easily bent or  otherwise deformed is _flexible_. Flexibility is not the exact  counterpart of stiffness, as it also involves toughness and  pliability.    If successively larger loads are applied to a body and then  removed it will be found that at first the body completely  regains its original form upon release from the stress--in other  words, the body is ~elastic~. No substance known is perfectly  elastic, though many are practically so under small loads.  Eventually a point will be reached where the recovery of the  specimen is incomplete. This point is known as the ~elastic  limit~, which may be defined as the limit beyond which it is  impossible to carry the distortion of a body without producing a  permanent alteration in shape. After this limit has been  exceeded, the size and shape of the specimen after removal of  the load will not be the same as before, and the difference or  amount of change is known as the ~permanent set~.    Elastic limit as measured in tests and used in design may be  defined as that unit stress at which the deformation begins to  increase in a faster ratio than the applied load. In practice  the elastic limit of a material under test is determined from  the stress-strain diagram. It is that point in the line where  the diagram begins perceptibly to curve.[2] (See Fig. 1.)    [Footnote 2: If the straight portion does not pass through the  origin, a parallel line should be drawn through the origin, and  the load at elastic limit taken from this line. (See Fig. 32.)]    ~Resilience~ is the amount of work done upon a body in deforming  it. Within the elastic limit it is also a measure of the  potential energy stored in the material and represents the  amount of work the material would do upon being released from a  state of stress. This may be graphically represented by a  diagram in which the abscissae represent the amount of deflection  and the ordinates the force acting. The area included between  the stress-strain curve and the initial line (which is zero)  represents the work done. (See Fig. 1.) If the unit of space is  in inches and the unit of force is in pounds the result is  inch-pounds. If the elastic limit is taken as the apex of the  triangle the area of the triangle will represent the ~elastic  resilience~ of the specimen. This amount of work can be applied  repeatedly and is perhaps the best measure of the toughness of  the wood as a working quality, though it is not synonymous with  toughness.    Permanent set is due to the ~plasticity~ of the material. A  perfectly plastic substance would have no elasticity and the  smallest forces would cause a set. Lead and moist clay are  nearly plastic and wood possesses this property to a greater or  less extent. The plasticity of wood is increased by wetting,  heating, and especially by steaming and boiling. Were it not for  this property it would be impossible to dry wood without  destroying completely its cohesion, due to the irregularity of  shrinkage.    A substance that can undergo little change in shape without  breaking or rupturing is ~brittle~. Chalk and glass are common  examples of brittle materials. Sometimes the word _brash_ is  used to describe this condition in wood. A brittle wood breaks  suddenly with a clean instead of a splintery fracture and  without warning. Such woods are unfitted to resist shock or  sudden application of load.    The measure of the stiffness of wood is termed the ~modulus of  elasticity~ (or _coefficient of elasticity_). It is the ratio of  stress per unit of area to the deformation per unit of          {      unit stress  }  length. { E = ------------- } It is a number indicative of          {      unit strain  }  stiffness, not of strength, and only applies to conditions  within the elastic limit. It is nearly the same whether derived  from compression tests or from tension tests.    A large modulus indicates a stiff material. Thus in green wood  tested in static bending it varies from 643,000 pounds per  square inch for arborvitae to 1,662,000 pounds for longleaf pine,  and 1,769,000 pounds for pignut hickory. (See Table IX.) The  values derived from tests of small beams of dry material are  much greater, approaching 3,000,000 for some of our woods. These  values are small when compared with steel which has a modulus of  elasticity of about 30,000,000 pounds per square inch.

This external pull is communicated to the  interior, so that any portion of the material exerts a pull or  tensile force upon the remainder, the ability to do so depending  upon the property of cohesion. The result is an elongation or  stretching of the material in the direction of the applied  force. The action is the opposite of compression.    Wood exhibits its greatest strength in tension parallel to the  grain, and it is very uncommon in practice for a specimen to be  pulled in two lengthwise. This is due to the difficulty of  making the end fastenings secure enough for the full tensile  strength to be brought into play before the fastenings shear off  longitudinally. This is not the case with metals, and as a  result they are used in almost all places where tensile strength  is particularly needed, even though the remainder of the  structure, such as sills, beams, joists, posts, and flooring,  may be of wood. Thus in a wooden truss bridge the tension  members are steel rods.    The tensile strength of wood parallel to the grain depends upon  the strength of the fibres and is affected not only by the  nature and dimensions of the wood elements but also by their  arrangement. It is greatest in straight-grained specimens with  thick-walled fibres. Cross grain of any kind materially reduces  the tensile strength of wood, since the tensile strength at  right angles to the grain is only a small fraction of that  parallel to the grain.    |--------------------------------------------------------------|  |                           TABLE II                           |  |--------------------------------------------------------------|  |   RATIO OF STRENGTH OF WOOD IN TENSION AND IN COMPRESSION    |  |           (Bul. 10, U.

Grate a pound of fine potatoes in two quarts of water, add to it the  trimmings of any meat, amounting to about a pound in quantity, a cup  of rice, a few sweet herbs, and a head of celery, stew well till the  liquor is considerably reduced, then strain it through a sieve; if,  when strained, it is too thin and watery, add a little thickening; it  should be flavoured only with white pepper and salt.           *       *       *       *       *    SOUP CRESSY.    Grate six carrots, and chop some onions with a lettuce, adding a few  sweet herbs, put them all into a stewpan, with enough of good broth  to moisten the whole, adding occasionally the remainder; when nearly  done, put in the crumb of a French roll, and when soaked, strain the  whole through a sieve, and serve hot in a tureen.           *       *       *       *       *    CARROT SOUP.    Take a dozen carrots scraped clean, rasp them, but do not use the  core, two heads of celery, two onions thinly sliced, season to taste,  and pour over a good stock, say about two quarts, boil it, then pass  it through a sieve; it should be of the thickness of cream, return it  to the saucepan, boil it up and squeeze in a little lemon juice, or  add a little vinegar.           *       *       *       *       *    PALESTINE SOUP.    Stew a knuckle of veal, and a calf's foot, and one pound of  _chorissa_, and a large fowl, in four quarts of water, add a piece of  fresh lemon peel, six Jerusalem artichokes, a bunch of sweet herbs,  a little salt and white pepper, and a little nutmeg, and a blade of  mace; when the fowl is thoroughly done, remove the white parts to  prepare for thickening, and let the rest continue stewing till the  stock is sufficiently strong, the white parts of the fowl must be  pounded and sprinkled with flower or ground rice, and stirred in the  soup after it has been strained, until it thickens.           *       *       *       *       *    A SIMPLE WHITE SOUP.    Break a knuckle of veal, place it in a stewpan, also a piece of  _chorissa_, a carrot, two onions, three or four turnips, and a blade  of mace, pour over two or three quarts of water or weak broth,  season with salt, a sprig of parsley, and whole white pepper; when  sufficiently boiled, skim and strain it, and thicken with pounded  vermicelli.           *       *       *       *       *    VERMICELLI SOUP.    Make a fine strong stock from the shin of beef, or any other part  preferred, and add, a short time before serving, a handful of  vermicelli, which should be broken, so that it may be in pieces of  convenient length, the stock should be more or less flavoured with  vegetables, and herbs, according to taste.           *       *       *       *       *    MATSO SOUP.    Boil down half a shin of beef, four pounds of gravy beef, and a calf's  foot may be added, if approved, in three or four quarts of water;  season with celery, carrots, turnips, pepper and salt, and a bunch of  sweet herbs; let the whole stew gently for eight hours, then strain  and let it stand to get cold, when the fat must be removed, then  return it to the saucepan to warm up. Ten minutes before serving,  throw in the balls, from which the soup takes its name, and which are  made in the following manner:    Take half a pound of _matso_ flour, two ounces of chopped suet, season  with a little pepper, salt, ginger, and nutmeg; mix with this, four  beaten eggs, and make it into a paste, a small onion shred and browned  in a desert spoonful of oil is sometimes added; the paste should be  made into rather large balls, and care should be taken to make them  very light.           *       *       *       *       *    TOMATA SOUP.    Take a dozen unpealed tomatas, with a bit of clarified suet, or a  little sweet oil, and a small Spanish onion; sprinkle with flour, and  season with salt and cayenne pepper, and boil them in a little gravy  or water; it must be stirred to prevent burning, then pass it through  a sieve, and thin it with rich stock to the consistency of winter  pea-soup; flavour it with lemon juice, according to taste, after it  has been warmed up and ready for serving.           *       *       *       *       *    ALMONDEGOS SOUP: A SUPERIOR WHITE SOUP.    Put a knuckle of veal and a calf's foot into two quarts of water, with  a blade of mace and a bunch of sweet herbs, a turnip, a little white  pepper, and salt; when sufficiently done, strain and skim it, and  add balls of forced meat, and egg balls. A quarter of an hour before  serving beat up the yolks of four eggs with a desert spoonful of lemon  juice, and three ounces of sweet almonds blanched and beaten with a  spoonful of powdered white sugar. This mixture is to be stirred into  the soup till it thickens, taking care to prevent its curdling.           *       *       *       *       *    A FINE VEGETABLE OR FRENCH SOUP.    Take two quarts of strong stock made of gravy beef, add to this,  carrots, turnips, leek, celery, brocoli, peas and French beans, all  cut as small as possible, add a few lumps of white sugar, pepper, and  salt, let it simmer till the vegetables are perfectly soft, and throw  in a few force-meat balls.           *       *       *       *       *    ASPARAGUS SOUP.    Take eight pounds of gravy beef, with five pints of water, a few sweet  herbs, and an onion shred, with a little pepper and salt; when the  strength of the meat is sufficiently extracted, strain off the soup,  and add to it a bundle of asparagus, cut small, with a little chopped  parsley and mint; the asparagus should be thoroughly done. A few  minutes before serving, throw in some fried bread cut up the size  of dice; pound a little spinach to a pulp, and squeeze it through a  cloth, stir about a tea-cup full of this essence into the soup, let it  boil up after to prevent a raw taste.           *       *       *       *       *    SOUP MAIGRE.    Chop three lettuces, a large handful of spinach, a little chervil, a  head of celery, two or three carrots, and four onions, put them on  the fire with half a pound of butter, and let them fry till slightly  browned, season with a little salt, sifted white sugar, and white  pepper, stew all gently in five pints of boiling water for about two  hours and a half, and just before serving the soup, thicken it with  the beaten yolks of four eggs, mixed first with a little of the soup,  and then stirred into the remainder.           *       *       *       *       *    SUMMER PEA SOUP.    Take a peck of peas, separate the old from the young, boil the former  till they are quite tender in good stock, then pass them through a  sieve, and return them to the stock, add the young peas, a little  chopped lettuce, small pieces of cucumber fried to a light brown, a  little bit of mint, pepper, and salt; two or three lumps of sugar give  a fine flavor.           *       *       *       *       *    WINTER PEA SOUP.    Soak a quart of white peas in water, boil them till soft, in as much  water as will cover them, pass them through a sieve, and add them to  any broth that may be ready, a little piece of _chorissa_ or smoked  beef will improve the flavour; this soup should be served with mint  and fried bread.           *       *       *       *       *    GIBLET SOUP.    Add to a fine strong well-seasoned beef stock, of about three quarts,  two sets of giblets, which should be previously stewed separately in  one quart of water (the gizzards require scalding for some time before  they are put in with the rest); white pepper, salt, and the rind of  lemon should season them; when they are tender, add them with their  gravy to the stock, and boil for about ten minutes together, then stir  in a glass of white wine, a table spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and  the juice of half a lemon; it will require to be thickened with a  little flour browned; the giblets are served in the soup.           *       *       *       *       *    BARLEY SOUP.    Put in a stew-pan, a knuckle of mutton, or four pounds of the neck,  with three quarts of water, boil it gently and keep it well skimmed;  a sprig of parsley, a couple of sliced turnips, a carrot, an onion or  more, if approved, with a little white pepper and salt, are sufficient  seasoning, a breakfast cup full of barley should be scalded and put in  the stew-pan with the meat, if when done, the soup is thin and watery,  a little prepared barley, mixed smoothly, should be stirred in.           *       *       *       *       *    SOUP DE POISSON, OR FISH SOUP.    Make a good stock, by simmering a cod's-head in water, enough to cover  the fish; season it with pepper and salt, mace, celery, parsley, and  a few sweet herbs, with two or three onions, when sufficiently done,  strain it, and add cutlets of fish prepared in the following manner:  cut very small, well-trimmed cutlets from any fish, sole or brill are  perhaps best suited; stew them in equal quantities of water and wine,  but not more than will cover them, with a large lump of butter, and  the juice of a lemon; when they have stewed gently for about fifteen  or twenty minutes, add them to the soup, which thicken with cream and  flour, serve the soup with the cutlets in a tureen; force-meat balls  of cod's liver are sometimes added.           *       *       *       *       *    OX TAIL SOUP.    Have two well cleaned tails and a neat's foot, cut them in small  joints and soak them in water, put them in a stew-pan with a large  piece of clarified suet or fat, and let them simmer for ten minutes,  then put to them between three and four quarts of cold water, four  onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, a carrot, a turnip, a head of celery,  and season with whole pepper, allspice, two or three cloves, and salt;  let it stew till the meat is tender enough to leave the bones, then  remove it from them, as the bones are unsightly in the soup; thicken  if necessary with browned flour, and just before serving, add a glass "]]]
