No! no! I will nibble your strings as long as my teeth  last, and afterwards do my best for the others. To preserve dependents  by sacrificing oneself is nowhere enjoined by wise moralists; on the  contrary--        'Keep wealth for want, but spend-it for thy wife,      And wife, and wealth, and all to guard thy life,'    \"Friend,\" replied King Speckle-neck, \"that may be the rule of policy,  but I am one that can by no means bear to witness the distress of those  who depend on me, for--        'Death, that must come, comes nobly when we give      Our wealth, and life, and all, to make men live,'    And you know the verse,        'Friend, art thou faithful? guard mine honor so!      And let the earthy rotting body go,'\"    When King Golden-skin heard this answer his heart was charmed, and his  fur bristled up for pure pleasure. \"Nobly spoken, friend,\" said he,  \"nobly spoken! with such a tenderness for those that look to thee, the  Sovereignty of the Three Worlds might be fitly thine.\" So saying he set  himself to cut all their bonds. This done, and the pigeons extricated,  the King of the Mice[6] gave them his formal welcome. \"But, your  Majesty,\" he said, \"this capture in the net was a work of destiny; you  must not blame yourself as you did, and suspect a former fault. Is it  not written--        'Floating on his fearless pinions, lost amid the noon-day skies,      Even thence the Eagle's vision kens the carcase where it lies;      But the hour that comes to all things comes unto the Lord of Air,      And he rushes, madly blinded, to his ruin in the snare,'\"    With this correction Golden-skin proceeded to perform the duties of  hospitality, and afterwards, embracing and dismissing them, the pigeons  left for such destination as they fancied, and the King of the Mice  retired again into his hole.    Now Light o' Leap, the Crow, had been a spectator of the whole  transaction, and wondered at it so much that at last he called out, \"Ho!  Golden-skin, thou very laudable Prince, let me too be a friend of thine,  and give me thy friendship.\"    \"Who art thou?\" said Golden-skin, who heard him, but would not come out  of his hole.    \"I am the Crow Light o' Leap,\" replied the other.    \"How can I possibly be on good terms with thee?\" answered Golden-skin  with a laugh; \"have you never read--        'When Food is friends with Feeder, look for Woe,      The Jackal ate the Deer, but for the Crow,'    \"No! how was that?\"    \"I will tell thee,\" replied Golden-skin:--      THE STORY OF THE JACKAL, DEER, AND CROW    \"Far away in Behar there is a forest called Champak-Grove,[7] and in it  had long lived in much affection a Deer and a Crow. The Deer, roaming  unrestrained, happy and fat of carcase, was one day descried by a  Jackal. 'Ho! ho!' thought the Jackal on observing him, 'if I could but  get this soft meat for a meal! It might be--if I can only win his  confidence,' Thus reflecting he approached, and saluted him.    'Health be to thee, friend Deer!'    'Who art thou?' said the Deer.    'I'm Small-wit, the Jackal,' replied the other. 'I live in the wood  here, as the dead do, without a friend; but now that I have met with  such a friend as thou, I feel as if I were beginning life again with  plenty of relations. Consider me your faithful servant.'    'Very well,' said the Deer; and then, as the glorious King of Day, whose  diadem is the light, had withdrawn himself, the two went together to the  residence of the Deer. In that same spot, on a branch of Champak, dwelt  the Crow Sharp-sense, an old friend of the Deer. Seeing them approach  together, the Crow said,    'Who is this number two, friend Deer?'    'It is a Jackal,' answered the Deer, 'that desires our acquaintance.'    'You should not become friendly to a stranger without reason,' said  Sharp-sense. 'Don't you know?'        \"To folks by no one known house-room deny:--      The Vulture housed the Cat, and thence did die.\"    'No! how was that?' said both.    'In this wise,' answered the Crow.      THE STORY OF THE VULTURE, THE CAT, AND THE BIRDS    \"On the banks of the Ganges there is a cliff called Vulture-Crag, and  thereupon grew a great fig-tree. It was hollow, and within its shelter  lived an old Vulture, named Grey-pate, whose hard fortune it was to have  lost both eyes and talons. The birds that roosted in the tree made  subscriptions from their own store, out of sheer pity for the poor  fellow, and by that means he managed to live. One day, when the old  birds were gone, Long-ear, the Cat, came there to get a meal of the  nestlings; and they, alarmed at perceiving him, set up a chirruping that  roused Grey-pate.    'Who comes there?' croaked Grey-pate.    \"Now Long-ear, on espying the Vulture, thought himself undone; but as  flight was impossible, he resolved to trust his destiny and approach.    'My lord,' said he, 'I have the honor to salute thee.'    'Who is it?' said the Vulture.    'I am a Cat,'    'Be off, Cat, or I shall slay thee,' said the Vulture.    'I am ready to die if I deserve death,' answered the Cat; 'but let what  I have to say be heard,'    'Wherefore, then, comest thou?' said the Vulture.    'I live,' began Long-ear, 'on the Ganges, bathing, and eating no flesh,  practising the moon-penance,[8] like a Bramacharya. The birds that  resort thither constantly praise your worship to me as one wholly given  to the study of morality, and worthy of all trust; and so I came here to  learn law from thee, Sir, who art so deep gone in learning and in years.  Dost thou, then, so read the law of strangers as to be ready to slay a  guest? What say the books about the householder?--        'Bar thy door not to the stranger, be he friend or be he foe,      For the tree will shade the woodman while his axe doth lay it low,'    And if means fail, what there is should be given with kind words, as--        'Greeting fair, and room to rest in; fire, and water from the well--      Simple gifts--are given freely in the house where good men dwell,'--    and without respect of person--        'Young, or bent with many winters; rich, or poor, whate'er thy guest,      Honor him for thine own honor--better is he than the best,'    Else comes the rebuke--        'Pity them that ask thy pity: who art thou to stint thy hoard,      When the holy moon shines equal on the leper and the lord!'    And that other, too,        'When thy gate is roughly fastened, and the asker turns away,      Thence he bears thy good deeds with him, and his sins on thee doth lay    For verily,        'In the house the husband ruleth, men the Brahmans \"master\" call;      Agni is the Twice-born Master--but the guest is lord of all,'    \"To these weighty words Grey-pate answered,    'Yes! but cats like meat, and there are young birds here, and therefore  I said, go,'    'Sir,' said the Cat (and as he spoke he touched the ground, and then his  two ears, and called on Krishna to witness to his words), 'I that have  overcome passion, and practised the moon-penance, know the Scriptures;  and howsoever they contend, in this primal duty of abstaining from  injury they are unanimous. Which of them sayeth not--        'He who does and thinks no wrong--      He who suffers, being strong--      He whose harmlessness men know--      Unto Swerga such doth go.'    \"And so, winning the old Vulture's confidence, Long-ear, the Cat,  entered the hollow tree and lived there. And day after day he stole away  some of the nestlings, and brought them down to the hollow to devour.  Meantime the parent birds, whose little ones were being eaten, made an  inquiry after them in all quarters; and the Cat, discovering this fact,  slipped out from the hollow, and made his escape. Afterwards, when the  birds came to look closely, they found the bones of their young ones in  the hollow of the tree where Grey-pate lived; and the birds at once  concluded that their nestlings had been killed and eaten by the old  Vulture, whom they accordingly executed. That is my story, and why I  warned you against unknown acquaintances.\"    \"Sir,\" said the Jackal, with some warmth, \"on the first day of your  encountering the Deer you also were of unknown family and character: how  is it, then, that your friendship with him grows daily greater? True, I  am only Small-wit, the Jackal, but what says the saw?--        \"In the land where no wise men are, men of little wit are lords;      And the castor-oil's a tree, where no tree else its shade affords.\"    The Deer is my friend; condescend, sir, to be my friend also.\"    'Oh!' broke in the Deer, 'why so much talking? We'll all live together,  and be friendly and happy--        'Foe is friend, and friend is foe,      As our actions make them so,'    \"Very good,\" said Sharp-sense; \"as you will;\" and in the morning each  started early for his own feeding-ground (returning at night). One day  the Jackal drew the Deer aside, and whispered, 'Deer, in one corner of  this wood there is a field full of sweet young wheat; come and let me  show you.' The Deer accompanied him, and found the field, and afterwards  went every day there to eat the green corn, till at last the owner of  the ground spied him and set a snare. The Deer came again very shortly,  and was caught in it, and (after vainly struggling) exclaimed, 'I am  fast in the net, and it will be a net of"]]]
