[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13489"],[0,"The Brochure Series of Architectural Illustration, Vol. 01, No. 01, January 1895 (#3)"],[1," *      A well-selected collection of foreign photographs has come to be as  necessary and invariable a feature in a well-equipped architect's  office as good drawing instruments or as Vignola's treatise on the  Roman Orders. But unfortunately a really satisfactory collection of  photographs is seldom within the reach of more than a small proportion  of the architects who could use them to advantage. This is partly on  account of the expense of a good collection, as photographs can hardly  be bought for less than twenty-five cents each, and partly on account  of the difficulty of finding a desirable stock from which to make  selections on this side of the Atlantic. Nearly all of the most  valuable collections have been gathered together abroad by the owners  and are the result of gradual accumulation, probably extending over  years of travel, and representing no small investment of money.    Such a collection, it is needless to say, is not within the grasp of  the young and struggling draughtsman, but he, of all others, would  profit most by possession and use of such a treasure if it could be  placed in his hands. It would help to form and direct his tastes,  making him familiar with the masterpieces of the past, and would  furnish a basis for comparison of the current work about him.    Of course a draughtsman in any of the larger offices will have certain  opportunities to study and work from the collection in the office  library. This is a valuable privilege, but it is only open to a few  out of the many draughtsmen in the country, and is not to be compared  in its resulting benefits to the actual possession of even a very much  smaller collection.           *       *       *       *       *    It is the purpose of the BROCHURE SERIES to place in the hands  of draughtsmen a most carefully selected series of photographic  reproductions, chosen both for their educational value and their  usefulness as practical reference material for everyday work. This can  be done at one fiftieth the cost of ordinary photographs, and thus be  easily within the reach of any draughtsman.    No attempt will be made to follow any systematic arrangement of the  subjects presented, although it will be frequently found advisable,  as in the present issue, to group a number of subjects of more or  less related character. The main result to be sought for is the  presentation of the greatest amount of the most valuable material in  the most available shape, and at the least cost. The possibility of  realizing this ambitious purpose remains to be demonstrated. It need  only be said that this initial number is put forward as an earnest of  the work to follow.           *       *       *       *       *    A most important feature in recent educational work as applied to  architecture is to be found in the formation of a number of classes,  or _ateliers_ as they are called, modelled in the main after those in  Paris. They are all formed with the purpose of furnishing instruction  in those elements of academic design which are unattainable in the  routine experience of office practice. The details of arrangement for  accomplishing this purpose vary somewhat in the different _ateliers_.  We believe the first to be started was the one connected with the  office of Messrs. Carrere & Hastings in New York. Here a limited  number of students, both young men and young women, are received, and  as a return for the instruction given them are expected to render such  assistance in the regular work of the draughting-room as they can.  This service is exactly similar to the \"niggering,\" as it is called,  required by long-established custom of the younger men at the Ecole  des Beaux-Arts at Paris, which is one of the most valuable features of  the school work. In Paris by this method the younger students have an  opportunity to come in personal and intimate contact with those more  advanced, and have the benefit of working on larger and more important  work than they are capable of undertaking unaided. In the new  _atelier_ a problem in design is given to the class, thus more than  ordinarily equipped for the work before him.      [Illustration:  VII. Portion of the Facade of the Ca D'oro, Venice.]      His work while abroad was systematic, well directed, and untiring, and  no one of the succeeding scholars has labored to better advantage or  accomplished more than he, although each in turn has had the example  and experience of his predecessors as a guide and stimulus to  increased endeavor. Mr. Blackall's time was devoted largely to travel,  together with the sketching and measuring of important work.    Since his return he has built up a successful and varied practice.    As an active member of the Boston Society of Architects and the  first president of the Boston Architectural Club, he has done much to  advance the best interests of the profession, both within its ranks  and in its relations to the public. To nothing so much as to his  faithful labors can the success of the Architectural Club be laid. He  has made it the largest and most effective organization of its kind  in the country, and the draughtsmen of Boston have every reason to be  thankful to him for his unselfish devotion to their interests.    He has, for several years, been the permanent chairman of the  Committee of the Boston Society of Architects, appointed to administer  the Rotch Scholarship, and through his earnest work the opportunities  open to its holders are being constantly increased.    (_To be continued_.)           *       *       *       *       *      Club Notes.      The youngest of the architectural societies of the country is the  Cleveland Architectural Club. It was organized in November last with a  membership of fifteen, which number has been rapidly growing and bids  fair to grow much further. In this instance, as has been the case in  all the other large cities where similar clubs have been formed, it  is the better class of draughtsmen who have felt the need of an  organization that would bring them together socially, and give an  opportunity for organized study and mutual improvement; and it is a  most encouraging symptom of the generally diseased condition of the  public mind in relation to architecture that these clubs have become  so numerous in the last few years. Aside from the direct influence  upon its own membership, the manifestation of a progressive and  aggressive spirit cannot help provoking curiosity and discussion  outside, if it accomplishes nothing further. It is somewhat surprising  that with the unusually active interest which Cleveland has always  evinced in matters relating to art, such a movement has not been  started before. We shall have occasion before long to refer more in  detail to this new and flourishing society.           *       *       *       *       *    The Illinois Chapter of the American Institute of Architects announces  the second annual competition for a gold medal, to be open to members  of the Chicago Architectural Club who are not practicising architects  of over two years' standing. The problem is the design for a memorial  building for the study of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, and is to  be finished on April 29.           *       *       *       *       *    The Chicago Architectural Club mingles work and play in a thoroughly  Bohemian fashion. A recent invitation card bid its members to attend a  \"Rip-Snorter at the Club House,\" stating that \"provisions and provisos  would be provided and Frou Frous be on tap.\" The exact significance  of this cabalistic description is known only to the members and their  guests. The same card announced that the new Constitution and By-Laws  would be finally voted upon at the same meeting, and further announced  the conditions of a forthcoming sketch competition. Things move  rapidly in Chicago.           *       *       *       *       *    The Chicago Architectural Club will hold its eighth annual exhibition  of works of architecture and the allied arts at the Art Institute  for two weeks beginning May 23. For further particulars, address John  Robert Dillon, secretary, 274 Michigan Avenue, Chicago.           *       *       *       *       *    The Buffalo Chapter of the A.I.A. will hold its second annual  exhibition in the Art Gallery, Library Building, in connection with  the exhibition of the Buffalo Society of Artists, from March 18 to  30.

The cheapest  time to lay down eggs, is early in spring, and the middle and last  of September. It is bad economy to buy eggs by the dozen, as you want  them.    New iron should be very gradually heated at first. After it has become  inured to the heat, it is not as likely to crack.    It is a good plan to put new earthen ware into cold water, and let it  heat gradually, until it boils,--then cool again. Brown earthen ware,  in particular, may be toughened in this way. A handful of rye, or  wheat, bran, thrown in while it is boiling, will preserve the glazing,  so that it will not be destroyed by acid or salt.    Clean a brass kettle, before using it for cooking, with salt and  vinegar.    Skim-milk and water, with a bit of glue in it, heated scalding hot, is  excellent to restore old, rusty, black Italian crape. If clapped and  pulled dry, like nice muslin, it will look as well, or better, than  when new.    Wash-leather gloves should be washed in clean suds, scarcely warm.    The oftener carpets are shaken, the longer they wear; the dirt that  collects under them, grinds out the threads.    Do not have carpets swept any oftener than is absolutely necessary.  After dinner, sweep the crumbs into a dusting-pan with your  hearth-brush; and if you have been sewing, pick up the shreds by hand.  A carpet can be kept very neat in this way; and a broom wears it very  much.    Buy your woollen yarn in quantities from some one in the country, whom  you can trust. The thread-stores make profits upon it, of course.    It is not well to clean brass andirons, handles, &c. with vinegar.  It makes them very clean at first; but they soon spot and tarnish.  Rotten-stone and oil are proper materials for cleaning brasses. If  wiped every morning with flannel and New England rum, they will not  need to be cleaned half as often.    If you happen to live in a house which has marble fire-places, never  wash them with suds; this destroys the polish, in time. They should be  dusted; the spots taken off with a nice oiled cloth, and then rubbed  dry with a soft rag.    Feathers should be very thoroughly dried before they are used. For  this reason they should not be packed away in bags, when they are  first plucked. They should be laid lightly in a basket, or something  of that kind, and stirred up often. The garret is the best place to  dry them; because they will there be kept free from dirt and moisture;  and will be in no danger of being blown away. It is well to put the  parcels, which you may have from time to time, into the oven, after  you have removed your bread, and let them stand a day.    If feather-beds smell badly, or become heavy, from want of proper  preservation of the feathers, or from old age, empty them, and wash  the feathers thoroughly in a tub of suds; spread them in your garret  to dry, and they will be as light and as good as new.    New England rum, constantly used to wash the hair, keeps it very  clean, and free from disease, and promotes its growth a great deal  more than Macassar oil. Brandy is very strengthening to the roots of  the hair; but it has a hot, drying tendency, which N.E. rum has not.    If you wish to preserve fine teeth, always clean them thoroughly after  you have eaten your last meal at night.    Rags should never be thrown away because they are dirty. Mop-rags,  lamp-rags, &c. should be washed, dried, and put in the rag-bag. There  is no need of expending soap upon them: boil them out in dirty suds,  after you have done washing.    Linen rags should be carefully saved; for they are extremely useful in  sickness. If they have become dirty and worn by cleaning silver, &c.,  wash them, and scrape them into lint.    After old coats, pantaloons, &c. have been cut up for boys, and are no  longer capable of being converted into garments, cut them into strips,  and employ the leisure moments of children, or domestics, in sewing  and braiding them for door-mats.    If you are troubled to get soft water for washing, fill a tub or  barrel half full of ashes, and fill it up with water, so that you may  have lye whenever you want it. A gallon of strong lye put into a great  kettle of hard water will make it as soft as rain water. Some people  use pearlash, or potash; but this costs something, and is very apt to  injure the texture of the cloth.    If you have a strip of land, do not throw away suds. Both ashes and  suds are good manure for bushes and young plants.    When a white Navarino bonnet becomes soiled, rip it in pieces, and  wash it with a sponge and soft water. While it is yet damp, wash it  two or three times with a clean sponge dipped into a strong saffron  tea, nicely strained. Repeat this till the bonnet is as dark a straw  color as you wish. Press it on the wrong side with a warm iron, and it  will look like a new Leghorn.    About the last of May, or the first of June, the little millers, which  lay moth-eggs begin to appear. Therefore brush all your woollens, and  pack them away in a dark place covered with linen. Pepper, red-cedar  chips, tobacco,--indeed, almost any strong spicy smell,--is good to  keep moths out of your chests and drawers. But nothing is so good as  camphor. Sprinkle your woollens with camphorated spirit, and scatter  pieces of camphor-gum among them, and you will never be troubled with  moths. Some people buy camphor-wood trunks, for this purpose; but they  are very expensive, and the gum answers just as well.    The first young leaves of the common currant-bush, gathered as soon as  they put out, and dried on tin, can hardly be distinguished from green  tea.    Cream of tartar, rubbed upon soiled white kid gloves, cleanses them  very much.    Bottles that have been used for rose-water, should be used for nothing  else; if scalded ever so much, they will kill the spirit of what is  put in them.    If you have a greater quantity of cheeses in the house than is likely  to be soon used, cover them carefully with paper, fastened on with  flour paste, so as to exclude the air. In this way they may be kept  free from insects for years. They should be kept in a dry, cool place.    Pulverized alum possesses the property of purifying water. A large  spoonful stirred into a hogshead of water will so purify it, that in  a few hours the dirt will all sink to the bottom, and it will be as  fresh and clear as spring water. Four gallons may be purified by a  tea-spoonful.    Save vials and bottles. Apothecaries and grocers will give something  for them. If the bottles are of good thick glass, they will always be  useful for bottling cider or beer; but if they are thin French glass,  like claret bottles, they will not answer.    Woollens should be washed in very hot suds, and not rinsed. Lukewarm  water shrinks them.    On the contrary, silk, or anything that has silk in it, should be  washed in water almost cold. Hot water turns it yellow. It may be  washed in suds made of nice white soap; but no soap should be put upon  it. Likewise avoid the use of hot irons in smoothing silk. Either rub  the articles dry with a soft cloth, or put them between two towels,  and press them with weights.    Do not let knives be dropped into hot dish-water. It is a good plan  to have a large tin pot to wash them in, just high enough to wash the  blades, _without wetting_ the handles. Keep your castors covered with  blotting-paper and green flannel. Keep your salt-spoons out of the  salt, and clean them often.    Do not wrap knives and forks in woollens. Wrap them in good, strong  paper. Steel is injured by lying in woollens.    If it be practicable, get a friend in the country to procure you a  quantity of lard, butter, and eggs, at the time they are cheapest, to  be put down for winter use. You will be likely to get them cheaper  and better than in the city market; but by all means put down your  winter's stock. Lard requires no other care than to be kept in a dry,  cool place. Butter is sweetest in September and June; because food is  then plenty, and not rendered bitter by frost. Pack your butter in a  clean, scalded firkin, cover it with strong brine, and spread a cloth  all over the top, and it will keep good until the Jews get into Grand  Isle. If you happen to have a bit of salt-petre, dissolve it with  the brine. Dairy-women say that butter comes more easily, and has a  peculiar hardness and sweetness, if the cream is scalded and strained  before it is used. The cream should stand down cellar over night,  after being scalded, that it may get perfectly cold.    Suet and lard keep better in tin than in earthen.    Suet keeps good all the year round, if chopped and packed down in a  stone jar, covered with molasses.    Pick suet free from veins and skin, melt it in water before a moderate  fire, let it cool till it forms into a hard cake, then wipe it dry,  and put it in clean paper in linen bags.    Preserve the backs of old letters to write upon. If you have children  who are learning to write, buy coarse white paper by the quantity, and  keep it locked up, ready to be made into writing books. It does not  cost half as much as it does to buy them at the stationer's.    Do not let coffee and tea stand in tin. Scald your wooden ware often;  and keep your tin ware dry.    When mattresses get hard and bunchy, rip them, take the hair out, pull  it thoroughly by hand, let it lie a day or two to air, wash the tick,  lay it in as light and even as possible, and catch it down, as before.  Thus prepared, they will be as good as new.    It is poor economy to buy vinegar by the gallon, Buy a barrel, or half  a barrel, of really strong vinegar, when you begin house-keeping.  As you use it, fill the barrel with old cider, sour beer, or  wine-settlings, &c., left in pitchers, decanters or tumblers; weak tea  is likewise said to be good: nothing is hurtful, which has a tolerable  portion of spirit, or acidity.
