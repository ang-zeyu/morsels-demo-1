Men? You mean devils.... Were they your enemies--Mormons?\"    \"Yes, ma'am.\"    \"To take revenge on a horse! Lassiter, the men of my creed are  unnaturally cruel. To my everlasting sorrow I confess it. They have been  driven, hated, scourged till their hearts have hardened. But we women  hope and pray for the time when our men will soften.\"    \"Beggin' your pardon, ma'am--that time will never come.\"    \"Oh, it will!... Lassiter, do you think Mormon women wicked? Has your  hand been against them, too?\"    \"No. I believe Mormon women are the best and noblest, the most  long-sufferin', and the blindest, unhappiest women on earth.\"    \"Ah!\" She gave him a grave, thoughtful look. \"Then you will break bread  with me?\"    Lassiter had no ready response, and he uneasily shifted his weight  from one leg to another, and turned his sombrero round and round in his  hands. \"Ma'am,\" he began, presently, \"I reckon your kindness of heart  makes you overlook things. Perhaps I ain't well known hereabouts, but  back up North there's Mormons who'd rest uneasy in their graves at the  idea of me sittin' to table with you.\"    \"I dare say. But--will you do it, anyway?\" she asked.    \"Mebbe you have a brother or relative who might drop in an' be offended,  an' I wouldn't want to--\"    \"I've not a relative in Utah that I know of. There's no one with a right  to question my actions.\" She turned smilingly to Venters. \"You will come  in, Bern, and Lassiter will come in. We'll eat and be merry while we  may.\"    \"I'm only wonderin' if Tull an' his men'll raise a storm down in the  village,\" said Lassiter, in his last weakening stand.    \"Yes, he'll raise the storm--after he has prayed,\" replied Jane. \"Come.\"    She led the way, with the bridle of Lassiter's horse over her arm.  They entered a grove and walked down a wide path shaded by great  low-branching cottonwoods. The last rays of the setting sun sent golden  bars through the leaves. The grass was deep and rich, welcome contrast  to sage-tired eyes. Twittering quail darted across the path, and from a  tree-top somewhere a robin sang its evening song, and on the still air  floated the freshness and murmur of flowing water.    The home of Jane Withersteen stood in a circle of cottonwoods, and was  a flat, long, red-stone structure with a covered court in the center  through which flowed a lively stream of amber-colored water. In the  massive blocks of stone and heavy timbers and solid doors and shutters  showed the hand of a man who had builded against pillage and time; and  in the flowers and mosses lining the stone-bedded stream, in the bright  colors of rugs and blankets on the court floor, and the cozy corner with  hammock and books and the clean-linened table, showed the grace of a  daughter who lived for happiness and the day at hand.    Jane turned Lassiter's horse loose in the thick grass. \"You will want  him to be near you,\" she said, \"or I'd have him taken to the alfalfa  fields.\" At her call appeared women who began at once to bustle about,  hurrying to and fro, setting the table. Then Jane, excusing herself,  went within.    She passed through a huge low ceiled chamber, like the inside of a fort,  and into a smaller one where a bright wood-fire blazed in an old open  fireplace, and from this into her own room. It had the same comfort as  was manifested in the home-like outer court; moreover, it was warm and  rich in soft hues.    Seldom did Jane Withersteen enter her room without looking into her  mirror. She knew she loved the reflection of that beauty which since  early childhood she had never been allowed to forget. Her relatives and  friends, and later a horde of Mormon and Gentile suitors, had fanned  the flame of natural vanity in her. So that at twenty-eight she scarcely  thought at all of her wonderful influence for good in the little  community where her father had left her practically its beneficent  landlord, but cared most for the dream and the assurance and the  allurement of her beauty. This time, however, she gazed into her  glass with more than the usual happy motive, without the usual slight  conscious smile. For she was thinking of more than the desire to be fair  in her own eyes, in those of her friend; she wondered if she were to  seem fair in the eyes of this Lassiter, this man whose name had crossed  the long, wild brakes of stone and plains of sage, this gentle-voiced,  sad-faced man who was a hater and a killer of Mormons. It was not  now her usual half-conscious vain obsession that actuated her as she  hurriedly changed her riding-dress to one of white, and then looked long  at the stately form with its gracious contours, at the fair face  with its strong chin and full firm lips, at the dark-blue, proud, and  passionate eyes.    \"If by some means I can keep him here a few days, a week--he will never  kill another Mormon,\" she mused. \"Lassiter!... I shudder when I think  of that name, of him. But when I look at the man I forget who he is--I  almost like him. I remember only that he saved Bern. He has suffered. I  wonder what it was--did he love a Mormon woman once? How splendidly he  championed us poor misunderstood souls! Somehow he knows--much.\"    Jane Withersteen joined her guests and bade them to her board.  Dismissing her woman, she waited upon them with her own hands. It was a  bountiful supper and a strange company. On her right sat the ragged  and half-starved Venters; and though blind eyes could have seen what  he counted for in the sum of her happiness, yet he looked the gloomy  outcast his allegiance had made him, and about him there was the shadow  of the ruin presaged by Tull. On her left sat black-leather-garbed  Lassiter looking like a man in a dream. Hunger was not with him, nor  composure, nor speech, and when he twisted in frequent unquiet movements  the heavy guns that he had not removed knocked against the table-legs.  If it had been otherwise possible to forget the presence of Lassiter  those telling little jars would have rendered it unlikely. And Jane  Withersteen talked and smiled and laughed with all the dazzling play  of lips and eyes that a beautiful, daring woman could summon to her  purpose.    When the meal ended, and the men pushed back their chairs, she leaned  closer to Lassiter and looked square into his eyes.    \"Why did you come to Cottonwoods?\"    Her question seemed to break a spell. The rider arose as if he had just  remembered himself and had tarried longer than his wont.    \"Ma'am, I have hunted all over the southern Utah and Nevada  for--somethin'. An' through your name I learned where to find it--here  in Cottonwoods.\"    \"My name! Oh, I remember. You did know my name when you spoke first.  Well, tell me where you heard it and from whom?\"    \"At the little village--Glaze, I think it's called--some fifty miles or  more west of here. An' I heard it from a Gentile, a rider who said you'd  know where to tell me to find--\"    \"What?\" she demanded, imperiously, as Lassiter broke off.    \"Milly Erne's grave,\" he answered low, and the words came with a wrench.    Venters wheeled in his chair to regard Lassiter in amazement, and Jane  slowly raised herself in white, still wonder.    \"Milly Erne's grave?\" she echoed, in a whisper. \"What do you know of  Milly Erne, my best-beloved friend--who died in my arms? What were you  to her?\"    \"Did I claim to be anythin'?\" he inquired. \"I know  people--relatives--who have long wanted to know where she's buried,  that's all.\"    \"Relatives? She never spoke of relatives, except a brother who was shot  in Texas. Lassiter, Milly Erne's grave is in a secret burying-ground on  my property.\"    \"Will you take me there?... You'll be offendin' Mormons worse than by  breakin' bread with me.\"    \"Indeed yes, but I'll do it. Only we must go unseen. To-morrow,  perhaps.\"    \"Thank you, Jane Withersteen,\" replied the rider, and he bowed to her  and stepped backward out of the court.    \"Will you not stay--sleep under my roof?\" she asked.    \"No, ma'am, an' thanks again. I never sleep indoors. An' even if I did  there's that gatherin' storm in the village below. No, no. I'll go to  the sage. I hope you won't suffer none for your kindness to me.\"    \"Lassiter,\" said Venters, with a half-bitter laugh, \"my bed too, is the  sage. Perhaps we may meet out there.\"    \"Mebbe so. But the sage is wide an' I won't be near. Good night.\"    At Lassiter's low whistle the black horse whinnied, and carefully picked  his blind way out of the grove. The rider did not bridle him, but walked  beside him, leading him by touch of hand and together they passed slowly  into the shade of the cottonwoods.    \"Jane, I must be off soon,\" said Venters. \"Give me my guns. If I'd had  my guns--\"    \"Either my friend or the Elder of my church would be lying dead,\" she  interposed.    \"Tull would be--surely.\"    \"Oh, you fierce-blooded, savage youth! Can't I teach you forebearance,  mercy? Bern, it's divine to forgive your enemies. 'Let not the sun go  down upon thy wrath.'\"    \"Hush! Talk to me no more of mercy or religion--after to-day. To-day  this strange coming of Lassiter left me still a man, and now I'll die a  man!... Give me my guns.\"    Silently she went into the house, to return with a heavy cartridge-belt  and gun-filled sheath and a long rifle; these she handed to him, and as  he buckled on the belt she stood before him in silent eloquence.    \"Jane,\" he said, in gentler voice, \"don't look so. I'm not going out to  murder your churchman. I'll try to avoid him and all his men. But can't  you see I've reached the end of my rope? Jane, you're a wonderful woman.  Never was there a woman so unselfish and good. Only you're blind in one  way.... Listen!\"    From behind the grove came"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13003"],[0,"Pioneers in Canada (#3)"],[1,"the seashore, and could get it fresh whenever they  liked, but among those who lived at a distance inland, and were still  required to fast when the Church so directed. Of course in many parts  of Europe they could get freshwater fish from the rivers or lakes. But  the supply was not equal to the demand; and fish sent up from the  seacoast soon went bad, so that the plan of salting and curing fish  was adopted. The Norsemen found it a paying business to fish  industriously in the seas round Iceland, Norway, Scotland, and  Ireland, salt and cure the fish, and then carry it to more southern  countries, where they exchanged it against wine, oil, clothing  materials, and other goods. This led to the Venetians (who had  absorbed so much of the carrying trade of the Mediterranean) sending  their ships through the Straits of Gibraltar into the northern seas  and trading with the Baltic for amber and salt fish. In the course of  this trade some Venetians, such as Antonio Zeno, found their way to  Norway and Iceland.[5] It is thought that by this means Venice became  acquainted with the records of the Icelandic voyages to North  America, and that her explorers thus grew to entertain the idea of a  sea journey westward, or north-westward, of Britain, bringing mariners  to a New World represented by the far-eastern extension of Asia.    [Footnote 5: Antonio Zeno served as pilot to Earl Sinclair of the  Faeroe Islands and of Roslyn, a Norman-Scottish nobleman who owed  joint fealty to the kings of Norway and Scotland. Sinclair was so  impressed with the stories of a \"Newland\" beyond Greenland that he  sailed to find it about 1390, but only reached Greenland.]    Christopher Columbus, the Genoese, conceived a similar idea, which  also may have owed something to the tradition of the Norsemen's  discovery of Vinland. But Columbus's theories were based on better  evidence, such as the discovery on the coasts of the Azores  archipelago, Madeira, and Portugal of strange seeds, tree trunks,  objects of human workmanship, and even (it is said) the bodies of  drowned savages--Amerindians--which had somehow drifted across, borne  by the current of the Gulf Stream, and escaping the notice of the  sharks.    Whilst Columbus was bestirring himself to find Asia across the  Atlantic, a sea pilot, JOHN CABOT (Zuan Cabota)--Genoese by birth, but  a naturalized subject of Venice--came to England and offered himself  to King Henry VII as a discoverer of new lands across the ocean. At  first he was employed at Copenhagen to settle fishery quarrels about  Iceland, and probably Cabota, or Cabot, visited Iceland in King  Henry's service, and there heard of the Icelandic colonies on the  other side of the Atlantic, only recently abandoned.    In 1496 King Henry VII provided money to cover some of the expense of  a voyage of discovery to search for the rumoured island across the  ocean. The people of Bristol were ordered to assist John Cabot, and by  them he was furnished with a small sailing ship, the _Matthew_, and a  crew of fifteen mariners. Cabot, with his two sons, Luis and Sancio,  sailed for Ireland and the unknown West in May, 1497, and, after a sea  voyage quite as wonderful as that of Columbus, reached the coast of  Cape Breton Island (or \"the New Isle\", as it was first named[6]) on  June 24, 1497. They found \"the land excellent, and the climate  temperate\". The sea was so full of fish along these coasts that the  mariners opined (truly) that henceforth Bristol need not trouble about  the Iceland trade. Here along this \"new isle\" were the predestined  fisheries of Britain.[7]    [Footnote 6: Cape Breton was not then, or for nearly two hundred years  afterwards, known to be an island. It was thought to be part of the  \"island\" (peninsula) of what we now call Nova Scotia, and the whole of  this region which advances so prominently into the Atlantic was  believed to be at first the great unknown \"New Island\" of Irish and  English legends--legends based on the Norse discoveries of the  eleventh century. Cape Breton was thus named by the Breton seaman who  came thither soon after the Cabot expeditions to fish for cod. This  large island is separated from Nova Scotia by the Gut of Canso, a  strait no broader than a river.]    [Footnote 7: Dr. S.E. DAWSON (_The St. Lawrence Basin_) says of this  voyage: \"When the forest wilderness of Cape Breton listened to the  voices of Cabot's little company (of Bristol mariners) it was the  first faint whisper of the mighty flood of English speech which was  destined to overflow the continent to the shores of another  ocean....\"]    They encountered no inhabitants, though they found numerous traces of  their existence in the form of snares, notched trees, and bone netting  needles. John Cabot hoisted the English flag of St. George and the  Venetian standard of St. Mark; then--perhaps after coasting a little  along Nova Scotia--fearful that a longer stay might cause them to run  short of provisions, he turned the prow of the _Matthew_ eastward, and  reached Bristol once more about August 6, and London on August 10,  1497, with his report to King Henry VII, who rewarded him with a  donation of L10. He was further granted a pension of L20 a year (which  he only drew for two years, probably because he died after returning  from a second voyage to the North-American coast), and he received a  renewal of his patent of discovery in February, 1498. In this patent  it is evidently inferred that King Henry VII assumed a sovereignty  over these distant regions because of John Cabot's hoisting of the  English flag on \"the new Isle\" (Cape Breton Island) in the preceding  year.    The new expedition of 1498 was a relatively important affair. The  king assisted to finance the ventures of the Bristol captains, and  five of his ships formed part of the little fleet. It is probable that  John Cabot was in command, and almost certain that his young son  Sebastian was a passenger, possibly an assistant pilot. The course  followed lay much farther to the north, and brought the little sailing  vessels amongst the icebergs, ice floes, polar bears, and stormy seas  of Greenland and Labrador. Commercially the voyage was a failure,  almost a disaster. The ships returned singly, and after a considerable  interval of time. Nevertheless, some of the king's loans were repaid  to him; and in 1501 a regular chartered company was formed (perhaps at  Bristol), with three Bristolians and three Portuguese as directors.  Henry VII not only gave a royal patent to this association, but lent  more money to enable it to explore and colonize these new lands across  the western sea.    There can be little doubt that between 1498 and 1505 these Bristol  ships, directed by Italian, English, and Portuguese pilots, first  revealed to the civilized world of western Europe the coasts of  Newfoundland, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Massachusetts, and  Delaware. They must have got as far south as the State of Delaware  (according to Sebastian Cabot, their southern limit was lat. 38 deg.),  because in 1505 they were able to bring back parrots (\"popyngays\"), as  well as hawks and lynxes (\"catts of the mountaigne\"), for the  delectation of King Henry; and parrots even at that period could not  have been obtained from farther north than the latitude of New  York.[8]    [Footnote 8: Almost certainly this was _Conurus carolinensis_, a green  and orange parrakeet still found in the south-eastern States of North  America, but formerly met with as far north as New York and Boston.]    But after 1505 English interest in \"the Newe founde launde\" and the  \"Newe Isle\" languished; the exploration of North America was taken up  and carried farther by Portuguese, Bretons and Normans of France,  Italians, and Spaniards.[9] It revived again under Henry VIII, owing  to the irresistible attraction of the Newfoundland fisheries and the  knowledge that the ships from France were returning every autumn with  great supplies of fish cured and salted; for an adequate supply of  salt fish was becoming a matter of great importance to the markets of  western Europe. In 1527 Henry VIII sent two ships under the command of  John Rut to explore the North-American coast, and Captain Rut seems  to have reached the Straits of Belle Isle between Newfoundland  and Labrador (then blocked with ice so that he took them for  a bay), and afterwards to have passed along the east coast of  Newfoundland--already much frequented by the Bretons, Normans, and  Portuguese--and to have stopped at the harbour of St. John's, thence  sailing as far south as Massachusetts.    [Footnote 9: The name _America_ probably appears for the first time in  English print in the old play or masque the _Four Elements_, which was  published about 1518. In a review of the geography of the Earth, as  known at that period, a description is given of this vast New World  across the Ocean: \"But these new landys found lately, been called  America, because only Americus did find them first\". Americus was a  Florentine bank clerk--Amerigo Vespucci--at Seville who gave up the  counting-house for adventure, sailed with a Spanish captain to the  West Indies and the mainland of Venezuela (off which he notes that he  met an English sailing vessel, and this as early as 1499!), and then  joined the first exploring voyage of the Portuguese to Brazil. He  returned to Europe, and in a letter to a fellow countryman at Paris,  written in the late autumn of 1502, he claimed to have discovered a  New World across the Ocean. His clear statement about what was really  the South American Continent aroused so much enthusiasm in civilized  Europe that five years afterwards the New World was called after him  by a German printer (Walzmueller) at the little Alsatian University of  St. Die. By 1518 the English writers and mariners were probably aware  that the discoveries of Cabot, Columbus, and the Portuguese indicated  the extension of \"America\""]]]
