While Fitch was in  London, Miss Leslie's father was one of his warmest friends, and  the papers of her family enable her to give many particulars of his  history unknown to other biographers. When several years ago. R.W.  Griswold published his Sketches of the Life and Labors of John Fitch,  the late Noah Webster sent him the following interesting letter upon  the subject:        DEAR SIR:--In your sketch of John Fitch you justly remarked      that his biography is still a desideratum. The facts related      of him by Mr. St. John to Mr. Stone, and published in the _New      York Commercial Advertiser_, are new to me; and never before      had I heard of Mr. Fitch at _Sharon_, in Connecticut; but      I know Mr. St. John very well, and cannot discredit his      testimony any more than I can Mr. Stone's memory. The      substance of the account given of Mr. Fitch by the      indefatigable J.W. Barber, in his Connecticut Historical      Collections, is as follows: John Fitch was born in East      Windsor, in Connecticut, and apprenticed to Mr. Cheney, a      watch and clock-maker, of East Hartford, now Manchester, a      new town separated from East Hartford. He married, but did not      live happily with his wife, and he left her and went to New      Brunswick, in New Jersey, where he set up the business of      clock-making, engraving, and repairing muskets, before the      revolution. When New Jersey was invaded by the British troops,      Mr. Fitch removed into the interior of Pennsylvania, where he      employed his time in repairing arms for the army.        Mr. Fitch conceived the project of steam navigation in 1785,      as appears by his advertisement. He built his boat in 1787.      In my Diary I have myself noted that I visited the boat, lying      at the wharf in the Delaware, on the ninth day of February,      1787. The Governor and Council were so much gratified with      the success of the boat that they presented Mr. Fitch with a      superb flag. About that time, the company, aiding Mr. Fitch,      sent him to France, at the request of Mr. Vail, our consul at      L'Orient, who was one of the company. But this was when France      began to be agitated by the revolution, and nothing in favor      of Mr. Fitch was accomplished; he therefore returned. Mr. Vail      afterward _presented to Mr. Fulton for examination the papers      of Mr. Fitch_, containing his scheme of steam navigation.      After Mr. Fitch returned to this country, he addressed a      letter to Mr. Rittenhouse, in which he predicted that in time      the _Atlantic would be crossed by steam power_; he complained      of his poverty, and urged Mr. Rittenhouse to buy his land in      Kentucky, for raising funds to complete his scheme. But he      obtained no efficient aid. Disappointed in his efforts to      obtain funds, he resorted to indulgence in drink; he retired      to Pittsburgh, and finally ended his life by plunging into      the Alleghany. His books and papers he bequeathed to the      Philadelphia Library, with the injunction that they were to      remain closed for thirty years. At the end of that period,      the papers were opened, and found to contain a minute account      of his perplexities and disappointments. Thus chiefly the      narration of Mr. Barber, who refers for authority to the      American edition of the Edinburgh Encyclopedia. It may be      worth while for some gentleman to attempt to find these      papers. N. WEBSTER.        Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.    The papers to which Dr. Webster alludes in the above letter, have  been examined by Miss Leslie, and the curious details they contain  of Fitch's early life, his courtship, unfortunate marriage, captivity  among the Indians, experiments, &c. will be embraced in her work,  which will undoubtedly be one of the most interesting biographies of  this country.           *       *       *       *       *    The director of the Museum of Paris has opened a very interesting  gallery of American antiquities, from Yucatan, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia,  and other countries of the New World.           *       *       *       *       *    ILLUMINATED BOOKS.    Mr. Owen Jones, an English architect, and the author of a very  beautiful work on the Alhambra, has been enabled, by the curious  process of chromo-lithography, originally discovered by the Bavarian,  Alois Sennefelder, to popularize and multiply almost indefinitely  the delicate and highly-finished illuminations executed by the pious  monkish artists of the middle ages.    According to Felton, the manuscript illuminators \"borrowed their title  from the illumination which a bright genius giveth to his work,\" and  they form the connecting link in the chain which unites the ancient  with the modern schools of painting. Their works, considered as a  subordinate branch of pictorial art, though frequently grotesque and  barbarous, are singularly characteristic of the epoch in which they  lived, whether we retrace the art to its Byzantine origin in the  earliest ages of Christianity, or follow it to its most complete  and harmonious development in the two centuries which preceded the  discovery of the printing press.    The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable  repugnance to the introduction of images, and the first notice we have  of the use of pictures is in the censure of the Council of Illiberis,  300 years after the Christian era. Of these one of the earliest and  most curious specimens is the consecrated banner which animated the  victorious soldiers of Constantine. The Labarum was a long pike,  topped with a crown of gold, inclosing a monogram expressive of  the cross and the two initial letters of the name of Christ, and  intersected by a transverse beam, from which hung a silken vail  curiously inwrought with the images of the reigning monarch and his  children. A medal of the Emperor Constantius is said to be still  extant in which the mysterious symbol is accompanied with the  memorable words, \"By this sign shalt thou conquer.\" The austere  simplicity of the Primitive Christians yielded at length to this  innovation of sacred splendor. Before the end of the sixth century the  use and even the worship of images, or pictorial representations of  sacred persons and subjects, was firmly established in the capital,  and those \"made without hands\" were propagated in the camps and cities  of the Eastern empire by monkish artists, whose flat delineations were  in the last degeneracy of taste.    In the eighth century, Leo the Isaurian ascended the throne of the  East, and for a time the public or private worship of images was  proscribed, but the edict was vigorously and successfully resisted by  the Latins of the Western church. Charlemagne, whose literary tastes  are attested by his encouragement of the learned, by the foundation of  schools, and by his patronage of the arts of music and painting, gave  a great impulse to the practice of illumination: and the Benedictines,  whose influence extended throughout Europe, assigned an eminent  rank among monastic virtues to the guardianship and reproduction of  valuable manuscripts. In each Benedictine monastery a chamber was set  apart for this sacred purpose, and Charlemagne assigned to Alcuin,  a member of their order, the important office of preparing a perfect  copy of the Scriptures.    The process of laving on and burnishing gold and silver appears  to have been familiar to oriental nations from a period of remote  antiquity, and the Greeks are supposed to have acquired from them the  art of thus ornamenting manuscripts, which they in turn communicated  to the Latins. Their most precious manuscripts were written in gold  or silver letters, on the finest semi-transparent vellum, stained of a  beautiful violet color (the imperial purple), and these were executed  only for crowned heads. One of the most ancient existing specimens of  this mode of caligraphy in the fourth century, the _Codex Argenteus_  of Ulphilas, the inventor of the Visigothic alphabet, was discovered  in the library of Wolfenbuettel, and is now at Upsal, Sweden. This  fine MS. is written in letters of gold and silver on a purple ground;  and the fragments of a Greek MS. of the Eusebian Canons of the sixth  century, preserved in the British Museum, is perhaps a unique example  of a MS. in which both sides of the leaves are illuminated upon a  golden ground. Mr. Owen Jones' illustrations commence with a page  from the celebrated Durham book, or _Gospels of St. Cuthbert_, in  the Hiberno-Saxon style of the seventh century, which was borrowed  originally from the Romans, and afterward diffused throughout Europe  by the itinerant-Saxon Benedictines. This style is formed by an  ingenious disposition of interweaving threads or ribbons of different  colors, varied by the introduction of extremely attenuated lizard-like  reptiles, birds, and other animals. The initial letters are of  gigantic size, and of extreme intricacy, and are generally surrounded  with rows of minute red dots.    The Coronation Oath Book of the Anglo-Saxon kings is a curious  specimen of the rude state of art in the ninth century. The Lombard  and the Carlovingian styles, of which latter the Psalter of Charles  the Bold, is a fine specimen, prevailed on the continent during the  eighth and ninth centuries. Toward the end of the tenth century,  the Anglo-Saxon school, under the patronage of Bishop Ethelwold,  at Winchester, assumed a new and distinct character, which was not  surpassed by any works executed at the same period. This style, with  its bars of gold, forming complete frames to the text, when enriched  with interweaving foliage of the acanthus and the ivy, became the  basis of the latter and more florid school of illumination, which  attained its highest perfection in the twelfth century, and of which  the Arnstein Bible is an example."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 1 (#3)"],[1,"portraits testify, beautiful Mistress Kellogg to be his wife. Here to  them were born \"them Field boys,\" Charles K. (April 24th, 1803) and  Roswell M. (February 22d, 1807), destined to be thorns in their  father's flesh throughout their school-days, his opponents in every  justice's court where they could volunteer to match their wits against  his, and, in the person of Roswell Martin, to be the distraction and  despair of the courts of Windsor County and Vermont, until a decision  of the Supreme Court so outraged that son's sense of the sacredness of  the marriage vow, that he shook the granite dust of Vermont from his  feet, and turned his face to the west, where he became the original  counsel in the Dred Scott case, married and had sons of his own.    [Illustration: GENERAL MARTIN FIELD.  _Eugene Field's Grandfather._]    But before taking up the thread of Roswell Martin Field's strange and  unique story, let me give a letter written by his father to his  sister, Miss Mary Field, then at the school of Miss Emma Willard in  Troy, N.Y., as exhibit number one, that Eugene Field came by his  peculiarities, literary and otherwise, by direct lineal descent.  Roswell was a phenomenal scholar, as his own eldest son was not. At  the age of eleven he was ready for college, and entered Middlebury  with his brother Charles, his senior by four years. How they conducted  themselves there may be judged from this letter to their sister:      Newfane, March 31st, 1822.      Dear Mary:      I sit down to write you my last letter while you remain at Troy.    Yours by Mr. Read was received, in which I find you allude to the    \"severe and satyrical language\" of mine in a former letter. That    letter was written upon the conduct of my children, which is an    important subject to me. If children are disobedient, a parent has a    right to be severe with them. If I recollect right I expressed to    you that your two oldest brothers' conduct was very reprehensible,    and I there predicted their ruin. But I then little thought that I    should soon witness the sad consequences of their ill-conduct. I    received a letter from President Bates about two weeks since and    another from Charles the same day, that Charles had been turned away    and forever dismissed from the college for his misconduct; Roswell    must suffer a public admonition and perhaps more punishment for his    evil deeds. Charles was turned out of college the 7th of March, and    I wrote on the week after to have him come directly home, but we    have heard nothing from him since. Where he is we can form no    conjecture. But probably he is five hundred miles distant without    money and without friends. I leave you to conjecture the rest.    Roswell is left alone at the age of fifteen to get along, if he is    permitted to stay through college.      These, Mary, are the consequences of dissipation and bad conduct.    And seeing as I do the temper and disposition of my children, that    they \"are inclined to evil and that continually,\" can you wonder    that I write with severity to them? Our hopes are blasted as relates    to Charles and Roswell, and you cannot conceive the trouble which    they have given us. Your mother is almost crazy about them; nor are    we without fears as to you. I say now, as I said in my former    letter, that I wish my children were all at home at work. I am    convinced that an education will only prove injurious to them. If I    had as many sons as had the patriarch Jacob not one should ever    again go nigh a college. It is not a good calculation to educate    children for destruction. The boys' conduct has already brought a    disgrace upon our family which we can never outgrow. They    undoubtedly possess respectable talents and genius, but what are    talents worth when wholly employed in mischief?      I have expended almost two thousand dollars in educating the boys,    and now just at the close they are sent off in disgrace and infamy.    The money is nothing in comparison to the disgrace and ruin that    must succeed. Mary, think of these things often, and especially when    you feel inclined to be gay and airy. Let your brother's fate be a    striking lesson to you. For you may well suppose that you possess    something of the same disposition that he does, but I hope that you    will exercise more prudence than he has. You must now return home    with a fixed resolution to become a steady, sober, and industrious    girl. Give up literary pursuits and quietly and patiently follow    that calling which I am convinced is most proper for my children.      It does appear to me that if children would consider how much    anxiety their parents have for them they would conduct themselves    properly, if it was only to gratify their parents. But it is not so.    Many of them seem determined not only to wound the feelings of the    parents in the most cruel manner but also to ruin themselves.      Remember us respectfully to Dr. and Mrs. Willard, and I am your    affectionate father      MARTIN FIELD.    That Mary did return home to be the mediator between her incensed and  stern father and his wayward and mischievous, but not incorrigible  sons, is part of the sequel to this letter. What her daughter, Mary  Field French, afterwards became to the sons of the younger of the  reprehensible pair of youthful collegians will appear later on in this  narrative. It is beautifully acknowledged in the dedication of Eugene  Field's \"Little Book of Western Verse,\" which I had the honor of  publishing for the subscribers in 1889, more than three score years  after the date of the foregoing letter. In that dedication, with the  characteristic license of a true artist, Field credited the choice of  Miss French for the care of his youthful years to his mother:      _A dying mother gave to you      Her child a many years ago;    How in your gracious love he grew,      You know dear, patient heart, you know._           *       *       *       *       *      _To you I dedicate this book,      And, as you read it line by line.    Upon its faults as kindly look      As you have always looked on mine._    In truth, however, it was the living bereaved father who turned in the  bewilderment of his grief to the \"dear patient heart\" of his sister,  to find a second mother for his two motherless boys. To Martin Field,  Mary was a guardian daughter, to Charles K. and Roswell M. 1st, she  was a loyal and mediating sister, and to Eugene and Roswell M. 2d, she  was a loving aunt, as her daughter Mary was an indulgent mother and  unfailing friend. The last name survived \"the love and gratitude\" of  Eugene's dedication ten years.    As may have been surmised the parental forebodings of the grieved and  satirical General Field were not realized in the eternal perdition of  his two sons. Education did not prove their destruction. With more  than respectable talents Charles was reinstated at Middlebury, and  four months later graduated with high honors, while Roswell took his  degree when only fifteen years old, the plague and admiration of his  preceptors, and, we may well suppose, the pride and joy of the  agonized parents, who welcomed the graduates to Newfane with all the  profusion of a prodigal father and the love of a distracted but doting  mother. They never had any reason to doubt the nature of sister Mary's  reception.    Charles and Roswell studied law with their father in the quaint little  office detached from the Field homestead at Newfane. The word edifice  might fittingly be applied to this building which, though only one  room square and one story high, has a front on the public square,  with miniature Greek columns to distinguish it from the ordinary  outbuildings that are such characteristic appendages of New England  houses. The troubles of General Field with his two sons were not to  end when he got them away from the temptations of college life, for  they were prone to mischief, \"and that continually,\" even under his  severe and watchful eye. This took one particular form which is the  talk of Windham County even yet. By reason of their presence in  General Field's office they were early apprised of actions at law  which he was retained to institute; whereupon they sought out the  defendant and offered their services to represent him gratis. Thus  the elder counsellor frequently found himself pitted in the justice's  courts against his keen-witted and graceless sons, who availed  themselves of every obsolete technicality, quirk, and precedent of  the law to obstruct justice and worry their dignified parent, whom  they addressed as \"our learned but erring brother in the law.\" Not  infrequently these youthful practitioners triumphed in these legal  tilts, to the mortification of their father, who, in his indignation,  could not conceal his admiration for the ingenuity of their  misdirected professional zeal.    [Illustration: ESTHER S. FIELD.  _Eugene Field's Grandmother._]    Two years after his graduation, and when only seventeen years of age,  Eugene Field's father was sufficiently learned in the law to be  admitted to the bar of Vermont. They wasted no time in those good old  days. Before he was thirty, Roswell M. Field had represented his  native town in the General Assembly, had been elected several times  State's Attorney, and in every way seemed destined to play a notable  part in the affairs of Vermont, if not on a broader field. He was not  only a lawyer of full and exact learning, an ingenious pleader, and  a powerful advocate, but an exceptionally accomplished scholar. His  knowledge of Greek, Latin, French, and German rendered their  literature a perennial source upon which to draw for the illumination  and embellishment of the pure and virile English of which he was  master. It was from him that Eugene inherited his delight in queer and  rare objects of vertu and that \"rich, strong, musical and sympathetic  voice\" which"]]]
