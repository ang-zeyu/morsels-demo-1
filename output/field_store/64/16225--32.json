THE Psalms of David,  In Metre.      Psalm 1:1. Common Metre,  The way and end of the righteous and the wicked.    1 Blest is the man who shuns the place  Where sinners love to meet;  Who fears to tread their wicked ways,  And hates the scoffer's seat:    2 But in the statutes of the Lord  Has plac'd his chief delight;  By day he reads or hears the word,  And meditates by night.    3 [He like a plant of generous kind,  By living waters set,  Safe from the storms and blasting wind,  Enjoys a peaceful state.]    4 Green as the leaf and ever fair  Shall his profession shine,  While fruits of holiness appear  Like clusters on the vine.    5 Not so the impious and unjust;  What vain designs they form!  Their hopes are blown away like dust,  Or chaff before the storm.    6 Sinners in judgment shall not stand  Amongst the sons of grace,  When Christ the Judge, at his right hand,  Appoints his saints a place.    7 His eye beholds the path they tread,  His heart approves it well;  But crooked ways of sinners lead  Down to the gates of hell.      Psalm 1:2. S. M.  The saint happy, the sinner miserable.    1 The man is ever blest  Who shuns the sinner's ways,  Among their counsels never stands,  Nor takes the scorner's place;    2 But makes the Law of God  His study and delight,  Amidst the labours of the day,  And watches of the night.    3 He like a tree shall thrive,  With waters near the root:  Fresh as the leaf his name shall live,  His works are heavenly fruit.    4 Not so th' ungodly race,  They no such blessings find;  Their hopes shall flee like empty chaff  Before the driving wind.    5 How will they bear to stand  Before that judgment-seat,  Where all the saints at Christ's right hand  In full assembly meet?    6 He knows, and he approves  The way the righteous go;  But sinners and their works shall meet  A dreadful overthrow.      Psalm 1:3. L. M.  The difference between the righteous and the wicked.    1 Happy the man whose cautious feet  Shun the broad way that sinners go,  Who hates the place where atheists meet,  And fears to talk as scoffers do.    2 He loves t' employ his morning light  Amongst the statutes of the Lord:  And spends the wakeful hours at night,  With pleasure pondering o'er the word.    3 He like a plant by gentle streams,  Shall flourish in immortal green;  And heaven will shine with kindest beams  On every work his hands begin.    4 But sinners find their counsels crost;  As chaff before the tempest flies,  So shall their hopes be blown and lost,  When the last trumpet shakes the skies.    5 In vain the rebel seeks to stand  In judgment with the pious race;  The dreadful Judge with stern command  Divides him to a different place.    6 \"Straight is the way my saints have trod,  \"I blest the path and drew it plain;  \"But you would choose the crooked road,  \"And down it leads to endless pain.      Psalm 2:1. S. M.  Translated according to the divine pattern,  Acts iv. 24 &c.    Christ dying, rising, interceding, and reigning.    1 [Maker and sovereign Lord  Of heaven, and earth, and seas,  Thy providence confirms thy word,  And answers thy decrees.    2 The things so long foretold  By David are fulfill'd,  When Jews and Gentiles join to slay  Jesus, thine holy child.]    3 Why did the Gentiles rage,  And Jews with one accord  Bend all their counsels to destroy  Th' anointed of the Lord?    4 Rulers and kings agree  To form a vain design;  Against the Lord their powers unite,  Against his Christ they join.    5 The Lord derides their rage,  And will support his throne;  He that hath rais'd him from the dead  Hath own'd him for his Son.    PAUSE.    6 Now he's ascended high,  And asks to rule the earth;  The merit of his blood be pleads,  And pleads his heavenly birth.    7 He asks, and God bestows  A large inheritance;  Far as the world's remotest ends  His kingdom shall advance.    8 The nations that rebel  Must feel his iron rod;  He'll vindicate those honours well  Which he receiv'd from God.    9 [Be wise, ye rulers, now,  And worship at his throne;  With trembling joy, ye people, bow  To God's exalted Son.    10 If once his wrath arise,  Ye perish on the place;  Then blessed is the soul that flies  For refuge to his grace.]    Psalm 2:2. C. M.  The same.    1 Why did the nations join to slay  The Lord's anointed Son?  Why did they cast his laws away,  And tread his gospel down?    2 The Lord that sits above the skies,  Derides their rage below,  He speaks with vengeance in his eyes,  And strikes their spirits thro'.    3 \"I call him my Eternal Son,  \"And raise him from the dead;  \"I make my holy hill his throne,  \"And wide his kingdom spread.    4 \"Ask me, my Son, and then enjoy  \"The utmost heathen lands:  \"Thy rod of iron shall destroy  \"The rebel that withstands.\"    5 Be wise, ye rulers of the earth,  Obey th' anointed Lord,  Adore the king of heavenly birth,  And tremble at his word.    6 With humble love address his throne,  For if he frown ye die;  Those are secure, and those alone,  Who on his grace rely.      Psalm 2:3. L. M.  Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension.    1 Why did the Jews proclaim their rage?  The Romans why their swords employ?  Against the Lord their powers engage  His dear anointed to destroy?    2 \"Come, let us break his bands,\" they say,  \"This man shall never give us laws ;\"  And thus they cast his yoke away,  And nail'd the monarch to the cross.    3 But God, who high in glory reigns,  Laughs at their pride, their rage controls;  He'll vex their hearts with inward pains,  And speak in thunder to their souls.    4 \"I will maintain the King I made  \"On Zion's everlasting hill,  \"My hand shall bring him from the dead,  \"And he shall stand your sovereign still.\"    5 [His wondrous rising from the earth  Makes his eternal Godhead known!  The Lord declares his heavenly birth,  \"This day have I begot my Son.    6 \"Ascend, my Son, to my right hand,  \"There thou shalt ask, and I bestow  \"The utmost bounds of heathen lands;  \"To thee the northern isles shall bow.\"]    7 But nations that resist his grace  Shall fall beneath his iron stroke;  His rod shall crush his foes with ease  As potters' earthen work is broke.    PAUSE.    8 Now, ye that sit on earthly thrones,  Be wise, and serve the Lord, the Lamb;  at his feet submit your crowns,  Rejoice and tremble at his name.    9 With humble love address the Son,  Lest he grow angry and ye die;  His wrath will burn to worlds unknown  If ye provoke his jealousy.    10 His storms shall drive you quick to hell:  He is a God, and ye but dust:  Happy the souls that know him well,  And make his grace their only trust.      Psalm 3:1. C. M.  Doubts and fears supprest; or, God  our defence from sin and Satan.    1 My God, how many are my fears!  How fast my foes increase!  Conspiring my eternal death,  They break my present peace.    2 The lying tempter would persuade  There's no relief in heaven;  And all my swelling sins appear  Too big to be forgiven.    3 But thou, my glory and my strength,  Shalt on the tempter tread,  Shalt silence all my threatening guilt,  And raise my drooping head.    4 [I cry'd, and from his holy hill  He bow'd a listening ear,  I call'd my Father, and my God,  And he subdu'd my fear.    5 He shed soft slumbers on mine eyes,  In spite of all my foes;  I woke, and wonder'd at the grace  That guarded my repose.]    6 What though the hosts of death and hell  All arm'd against me stood,  Terrors no more shall shake my soul,  My refuge is my God.    7 Arise, O Lord, fulfil thy grace,  While I thy glory sing:  My God has broke the serpent's teeth,  And death has lost his sting.    8 Salvation to the Lord belongs,  His arm alone can save;  Blessings attend thy people here,  And reach beyond the grave.      Psalm 3:2. 1 2 3 4 5 8. L. M.  A morning Psalm.    1 O Lord, how many are my foes,  In this weak state of flesh and blood!  My peace they daily discompose,  But my defence and hope is God.    2 Tir'd with the burdens of the day,  To thee I rais'd an evening cry;  Thou heardst when I began to pray,  And thine almighty help was nigh.    3 Supported by thine heavenly aid,  I laid me down and slept secure;  Not death should make my heart afraid,  Tho' I should wake and rise no more.    4 But God sustain'd me all the night;  Salvation doth to God belong;  He rais'd my head to see the light,  And make his praise my morning song.      Psalm 4:1. 1 2 3 5 6 7. L. M.  Hearing prayer; or, God our  portion, and Christ our hope.    1 O God of grace and righteousness,  Hear and attend when I complain;  Thou hast enlarg'd me in distress,  Bow down a gracious ear again.    2 Ye sons of men, in vain ye try  To turn my glory into shame;  How long will scoffers love to lie,  And dare reproach my Saviour's name!    3 Know that the Lord divides his saints  From all the tribes of men beside;  He hears the cry of penitents  For the dear sake of Christ that dy'd.    4 When our obedient hands have done  A thousand works of righteousness,  We put our trust in God alone,  And glory in his pardoning grace.    5 Let the unthinking many say,  \"Who will bestow some earthly good?\"  But, Lord, thy light"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13172"],[0,"True Stories of Crime From the District Attorney's Office (#3)"],[1,"far enough, threw the money on the  table and asked Clark to count it, at the same tune telling Mrs. Parker  that she was in custody. The girl turned white, uttered a little scream,  and then, regaining her self-possession, remarked as nonchalently as you  please:    \"Well, clever as you think you are, you have destroyed the only evidence  against me--my handwriting.\"    \"Not much,\" remarked Peabody, producing the sheet of paper.    The girl saw that the game was up and made a mock bow to the two  detectives.    \"I take off my hat to the New York police,\" said she.    At this time, apparently, no thought of denying her guilt had entered  her mind, and at the station house she talked freely to the sergeant,  the matron and the various newspaper men who were present, even drawing  pictures of herself upon loose sheets of paper and signing her name,  apparently rather enjoying the notoriety which her arrest had  occasioned. A thorough search of her apartment was now made with the  result that several sheets of paper were found there bearing what were  evidently practice signatures of the name of Alice Kauser. (Fig. 5.)  Evidence was also obtained showing that, on the day following her  husband's arrest, she had destroyed large quantities of blank check  books and blank checks.    Upon the trial of Mrs. Parker the hand-writing experts testified that  the Bierstadt and Kauser signatures were so perfect that it would be  difficult to state that they were not originals. The Parker woman was  what is sometimes known as a \"free hand\" forger; she never traced  anything, and as her forgeries were written by a muscular imitation of  the pen movement of the writer of the genuine signature they were almost  impossible of detection. When Albert T. Patrick forged the signature of  old Mr. Rice to the spurious will of 1900 and to the checks for $25,000,  $65,000 and $135,000 upon Swenson's bank and the Fifth Avenue Trust Co.,  the forgeries were easily detected from the fact that as Patrick had  _traced_ them they were _all almost exactly alike and practically could  be superimposed one upon another, line for line, dot for dot_.[1]    [Footnote 1: See _Infra_, p. 304.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Practice signatures of the name of Alice  Kauser.]    Mabel Parker's early history is shrouded in a certain amount of  obscurity, but there is reason to believe that she was the offspring of  respectable laboring people who turned her over, while she was still an  infant, to a Mr. and Mrs. Prentice, instructors in physical culture in  the public schools, first of St. Louis and later of St. Paul, Minnesota.  As a child, and afterwards as a young girl, she exhibited great  precocity and a considerable amount of real ability in drawing and in  English composition, but her very cleverness and versatility were the  means of her becoming much more sophisticated than most young women of  her age, with the result that while still in her teens she gave her  adopted parents ground for considerable uneasiness. Accordingly they  decided to place her for the next few years in a convent near New York.  By this time she had attained a high degree of proficiency in writing  short stories and miscellaneous articles, which she illustrated herself,  for the papers and inferior magazines. Convent life proved very dull for  this young lady, and accordingly one dark evening, she made her exit  from the cloister by means of a conveniently located window.    Waiting for her in the grounds below was James Parker, twenty-seven  years old, already of a large criminal experience, although never yet  convicted of crime. The two made their way to New York, were married,  and the girl entered upon her career. Her husband, whose real name was  James D. Singley, was a professional Tenderloin crook, ready to turn his  hand to any sort of cheap crime to satisfy his appetites and support  life; the money easily secured was easily spent, and Singley, at the  time of his marriage, was addicted to most of the vices common to the  habitues of the under world. His worst enemy was the morphine habit and  from her husband Mrs. Singley speedily learned the use of the drug. At  this time Mabel Prentice-Parker-Singley was about five feet two inches  in height, weighing not more than 105 or 110 pounds, slender to  girlishness and showing no maturity save in her face, which, with its  high color, brilliant blue eyes, and her yellow hair, often led those  who glanced at her casually to think her good looking. Further  inspection, however, revealed a fox-like expression, an irregularity in  the position of the eyes, a hardness in the lines of the mouth and a  flatness of the nose which belied the first impression. This was  particularly true when, after being deprived of morphine in the Tombs,  her ordinary high color gave way at her second trial to a waxy paleness  of complexion. But the story of her career in the Tenderloin would  prove neither profitable nor attractive.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--The check on which the indictment for forgery  was brought.]    The subsequent history of the Parker case is a startling example of the  credulity of the ordinary jury. The evidence secured was absolutely  conclusive, but unfortunately juries are generally unwilling to take the  uncorroborated word of a policeman against that of a  defendant--particularly if the defendant be a young and pretty woman.  Here at the very outset was a complete confession on the part of Mrs.  Parker, supplemented by illustrations from her own pen of what she could  do. Comparison showed that the signatures she had written without a  model upon the Peabody sheet were identical with those upon the forged  checks (Fig. 6) and with Mr. Bierstadt's and Miss Kauser's handwriting.  When Mrs. Parker's case, therefore, came on for pleading, her counsel,  probably because they could think of nothing else to do, entered a plea  of _insanity_. It was also intimated that the young woman would probably  plead guilty, and the case was therefore placed upon the calendar and  moved for trial without much preparation on the part of the prosecution.  Instead of this young person confessing her guilt, however, she amused  herself by ogling the jury and drawing pictures of the Court, the  District Attorney and the various witnesses.    Probably no more extraordinary scene was ever beheld in a court of law  than that exhibited by Part II of the General Sessions upon Mabel  Parker's first trial for forgery. Attired in a sky blue dress and  picture hat, with new white gloves, she sat jauntily by the side of her  counsel throughout the proceedings toying with her pen and pencil and in  the very presence of the jury copying handwriting which was given her  for that purpose by various members of the yellow press who crowded  close behind the rail. From time to time she would dash off an aphorism  or a paragraph in regard to the trial which she handed to a reporter. If  satisfactory this was elaborated and sometimes even illustrated by her  for the evening edition of his paper.    The Assistant District Attorney complained that this was clearly a  contempt of court, particularly as the defendant had drawn a picture  not only of himself, but of the presiding justice and a witness, which  had appeared in one of the evening papers. The Court, however, did not  see that anything could be done about it and the girl openly continued  her literary and artistic recreation. The Court itself was not a little  amused at the actions of the defendant, and when Detective Peabody was  called to the stand the general hilarity had reached such a pitch that  he was unable to give his testimony without smiling. The natural result,  therefore, at the first trial, was that the detective succeeded in  giving the unqualified impression that he was drawing the long bow in a  most preposterous fashion.    At the conclusion of the People's case the evidence that Mrs. Parker had  forged the checks amounted simply to this: That an officer who was  greatly interested in her conviction had sworn to a most astonishing  series of facts from which the jury must infer that this exceedingly  astute young person had not only been entirely and completely deceived  by a detective, but also that at almost their first meeting she had  confessed to him in detail the history of her crimes. Practically the  only other evidence tending to corroborate his story were a few  admissions of a similar character made by her to newspaper men, matrons  and officers at the police station. Unless the jury were to believe that  Mrs. Parker had actually written the signatures on \"the Peabody sheet\"  there was no evidence that she was the actual forger; hence upon  Peabody's word alone depended the verdict of the jury. The trouble with  the case was that it was _too_ strong, _too_ good, to be entirely  credible, and had there been no defense it is exceedingly probable that  the trial would have resulted in an acquittal, since the prosecution had  elected to go to the jury upon the question of whether or not the  defendant had actually signed the checks herself.    Mrs. Parker, however, had withdrawn her plea of insanity and determined  to put in a defense, which proved in its turn to be even more  extraordinary than the case against her. This, in brief, was to the  effect that she had known Peabody to be a police officer all along, but  that it had occurred to her that if she could deceive him into believing  that it was she _herself_ who had committed the forgeries her husband  might get off, and that later she might in turn establish her own  innocence. She had therefore hastily scratched her name on the top of a  sheet already containing her husband's handwriting and had told Peabody  that the signatures had been written by herself. That the sheet had been  written in the officer's presence she declared to be a pure invention  on his part to secure her conviction. She told her extremely"]]]
