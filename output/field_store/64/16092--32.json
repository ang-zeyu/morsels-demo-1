For I believe of a  surety that God had forgiven him all his sins, and he would now suffer no  more because of the cares and the troubles of this life. Thus Queen Helen  found him, and finding him she made no moan or outcry of any kind, only she  looked for a long while into his dead face, which she could see very  plainly now, because that the dawn had already broken. And by and by she  said: \"Dear Lord, thou art at this time in a happier case than I.\" And by  and by she said to Foliot: \"Go and bring his horse to this place, that we  may bear him hence.\" \"Lady,\" said Foliot, \"it is not good for you to be  left here alone.\" \"Foliot,\" said the Queen, \"thou dost not know how much  alone I am; thy leaving me here cannot make me more alone.\" Therewith she  fell to weeping with great passion.    Then Foliot wept also in great measure and, still weeping like rain, he  went away and left her. When he came again with King Ban's horse the sun  had risen and all the birds were singing with great jubilation and  everything was so blithe and gay that no one could have believed that care  and trouble could dwell in a world that was so beautiful.    [Sidenote: The Lady Helen bringeth her dead down from the Mountain] So  Queen Helen and Foliot lifted the dead king to his horse and then the Queen  said: \"Come thou, Foliot, at thine own gait, and I will go ahead and seek  my child, for I have yet Launcelot to be my joy. Haply he will be needing  me at this moment.\" So the Queen made haste down the steep hill ahead of  Foliot and by and by she came to the margin of that little lake where they  had rested awhile since.    By now the sun had risen very strong and warm so that all the lake, and the  meadows circumadjacent, and the forest that stood around about that meadow  were illumined with the glory of his effulgence.    Now as Queen Helen entered that meadow she beheld that a very wonderful  lady was there, and this lady bare the child Launcelot in her arms. And the  lady sang to Launcelot, and the young child looked up into her face and  laughed and set his hand against her cheek. All this Queen Helen beheld;  and she likewise beheld that the lady was of a very extraordinary  appearance, being clad altogether in green that glistered and shone with a  wonderful brightness. And she beheld that around the neck of the lady was a  necklace of gold, inset with opal stones and emeralds; and she perceived  that the lady's face was like ivory--very white and clear--and that her  eyes, which were very bright, shone like jewels set into ivory. And she saw  that the lady was very wonderfully beautiful, so that the beholder, looking  upon her, felt a manner of fear--for that lady was Fay.    (And that lady was the Lady of the Lake, spoken of aforetime in the Book of  King Arthur, wherein it is told how she aided King Arthur to obtain that  wonderful, famous sword yclept Excalibur, and how she aided Sir Pellias,  the Gentle Knight, in the time of his extremity, and took him into the lake  with her. Also divers other things concerning her are told of therein.)    Then the Queen came near to where the lady was, and she said to her,    \"Lady, I pray you give me my child again!\" Upon this the Lady of the Lake  smiled very strangely and said: \"Thou shalt have thy child again, lady, but  not now; after a little thou shalt have him again.\" Then Queen Helen cried  out with great agony of passion: \"Lady, would you take my child from me?  Give him to me again, for he is all I have left in the world. Lo, I have  lost house and lands and husband, and all the other joys that life has me  to give, wherefore, I beseech you, take not my child from me.\" To this the  Lady of the Lake said: \"Thou must endure thy sorrow a while longer; for it  is so ordained that I must take thy child; for I take him only that I may  give him to thee again, reared in such a wise that he shall make the glory  of thy house to be the glory of the world. For he shall become the greatest  knight in the world, and from his loins shall spring a greater still than  he, so that the glory of the House of King Ban shall be spoken of as long  as mankind shall last.\" But Queen Helen cried out all the more in a great  despair: \"What care I for all this? I care only that I shall have my little  child again! Give him to me!\"    [Sidenote: The Lady of the Lake taketh Launcelot into the Lake] Therewith  she would have laid hold of the garments of the Lady of the Lake in  supplication, but the Lady of the Lake drew herself away from Queen Helen's  hand and said: \"Touch me not, for I am not mortal, but Fay.\" And thereupon  she and Launcelot vanished from before Queen Helen's eyes as the breath  vanishes from the face of a mirror.    For when you breathe upon a mirror the breath will obscure that which lieth  behind; but presently the breath will disappear and vanish, and then you  shall behold all things entirely clear and bright to the sight again. So  the Lady of the Lake vanished away, and everything behind her where she had  stood was clear and bright, and she was gone.    Then Queen Helen fell down in a swoon, and lay beside the lake of the  meadow like one that is dead; and when Foliot came he found her so and wist  not what to do for her. There was his lord who was dead and his lady who  was so like to death that he knew not whether she was dead or no. So he  knew not what to do but sat down and made great lamentation for a long  while.    [Sidenote: The Lady Helen taketh to a Nunnery] What time he sat thus there  came that way three nuns who dwelt in an abbey of nuns which was not a  great distance away from that place. These made great pity over that  sorrowful sight, and they took away from there the dead King and the woeful  Queen, and the King they buried in holy ground, and the Queen they let live  with them and she was thereafter known as the \"Sister of Sorrows.\"    [Sidenote: How Launcelot dwelt in the lake] Now Launcelot dwelt for nigh  seventeen years with the Lady Nymue of the Lake in that wonderful,  beautiful valley covered over with the appearance of such a magical lake as  hath been aforetime described in the Book of King Arthur.    And that land of the lake was of this sort that shall here be described:--    Unto anyone who could enter into the magic water of that lake (and there  were very few of those who were mortal who were allowed to come to those  meadows of Faery that were there concealed beneath those enchanted waters)  he would behold before him a wide and radiant field of extraordinary  beauty. And he would behold that that field was covered all over with such  a multitude of exquisite and beautiful flowers that the heart of the  beholder would be elated with pure joy to find himself in the midst of that  waving sea of multitudinous and fragrant blossoms. And he would behold many  fair and shady groves of trees that here and there grew up from that  valley, each glade overshadowing a fountain of water as clear as crystal.  And he would perhaps behold, at such pleasant places beneath the shade of  those trees, some party of the fair and gentle folk of that country; and he  would see them playing in sport, or he would hear them chanting to the  music of shining golden harps. And he would behold in the midst of that  beautiful plain a wonderful castle with towers and roofs uplifted high into  the sky, and all shining in the peculiar radiance of that land, like to  castles and battlements of pure gold.    Such was the land unto which Launcelot was brought, and from what I have  told you you may see what a wonderful, beautiful place it was.    And the mystery of that place entered into the soul of Launcelot, so that  thereafter, when he came out thence, he was never like other folk, but  always appeared to be in a manner remote and distant from other of his  fellow-mortals with whom he dwelt.    For though he smiled a great deal, it was not often that he laughed; and if  he did laugh, it was never in scorn, but always in loving-kindness.          *       *       *       *       *    It was here in this land that Sir Pellias had now dwelt for several years,  with great peace and content. (For it hath been told in the Book of King  Arthur how, when he was upon the edge of death, the Lady Nymue of the Lake  brought him back to life again, and how, after that time, he was half fay  and half mortal.)    And the reason why Launcelot was brought to that place was that Sir Pellias  might teach him and train him in all the arts of chivalry. For no one in  all the world was more skilful in arms than Sir Pellias, and no one could  so well teach Launcelot the duties of chivalry as he.    So Sir Pellias taught Launcelot all that was best of knighthood, both as to  conduct of manner, and as to the worthiness and skill at arms, wherefore it  was that when Launcelot was completely taught, there was no knight in all  the world who was his peer in strength of arms or in courtesy of behavior,  until his own son, Sir Galahad, appeared in the courts of chivalry as shall  by and by be told of.    So when Launcelot came forth into the world again he became the greatest  knight in all the history of chivalry, wherefore that prophecy of his  mother was fulfilled as to his being like to a bright star of exceeding  lustre.    Accordingly, I have herein told you with great particularity all these  circumstances of his early history so that you may know exactly how it was  that he was taken away into the lake, and why it was that he was afterward  known as Sir Launcelot, surnamed of the Lake.    As to how he came into the world to achieve that greatness unto which he  had been preordained, and as to how King Arthur made him knight, and as to  many very excellent adventures that befell him, you shall immediately read  in what followeth.

In the  flood-tides of the spring the water in this chasm has risen 126 feet.  The word \"Dalles\" is rather misleading. The word is French, \"dalle,\"  and means, variously, \"a plate,\" \"a flagstone,\" \"a slab,\" alluding to  the oval or square shaped stones which abound in the river bed and the  valley above. But the early French hunters and trappers called a chasm  or a defile or gorge, \"dalles,\" meaning in their vernacular \"a  trough\"--and \"Dalles\" it has remained. There is a quaint Indian legend  connected with the spot which may interest the curious, and it runs  something on this wise, Clark's Fork and the Snake river, it will be  remembered, unite at Ainsworth to form the Columbia. It flows furiously  for a hundred miles and more westward, and when it reaches the outlying  ridges of the Cascade chain it finds an immense low surface paved with  enormous sheets of basaltic rock. But here is the legend:    THE LEGEND OF THE DALLES.    In the very ancient far-away times the sole and only inhabitants of the  world were fiends, and very highly uncivilized fiends at that. The  whole Northwest was then one of the centres of volcanic action. The  craters of the Cascades were fire breathers and fountains of liquid  flame. It was an extremely fiendish country, and naturally the  inhabitants fought like devils. Where the great plains of the Upper  Columbia now spread was a vast inland sea, which beat against a rampart  of hills to the east of The Dalles. And the great weapon of the fiends  in warfare was their tails, which were of prodigious size and terrible  strength. Now, the wisest, strongest, and most subtle fiend of the  entire crew was one fiend called the \"Devil.\" He was a thoughtful  person and viewed with alarm the ever increasing tendency among his  neighbors toward fighting and general wickedness. The whole tribe met  every summer to have a tournament after their fashion, and at one of  these reunions the Devil arose and made a pacific speech. He took  occasion to enlarge on the evils of constant warfare, and suggested  that a general reconciliation take place and that they all live in  peace. The astonished fiends could not understand any such unwarlike  procedure from _him_, and with one accord, suspecting treachery, made  straight at the intended reformer, who, of course, took to his heels.  The fiends pressed him hard as he sped over the plains of The Dalles,  and as he neared the defile he struck a Titanic blow with his tail on  the pavement--and a chasm opened up through the valley, and down rushed  the waters of the inland sea. But a battalion of the fiends still  pursued him, and again he smote with his tail and more strongly, and a  vaster cleft went up and down the valley, and a more terrific torrent  swept along. The leading fiends took the leap, but many fell into the  chasm--and still the Devil was sorely pursued. He had just time to rap  once more and with all the vigor of a despairing tail. And this time he  was safe. A third crevice, twice the width of the second, split the  rocks, riving a deeper cleft in the mountain that held back the inland  sea, making a gorge through the majestic chain of the Cascades and  opening a way for the torrent oceanward. It was the crack of doom for  the fiends. Essaying the leap, they fell far short of the edge, where  the Devil lay panting. Down they fell and were swept away by the flood;  so the whole race of fiends perished from the face of the earth. But  the Devil was in sorry case. His tail was unutterably dislocated by his  last blow; so, leaping across the chasm he had made, he went home to  rear his family thoughtfully. There were no more antagonists; so,  perhaps, after all, tails were useless. Every year he brought his  children to The Dalles and told them the terrible history of his  escape. And after a time the fires of the Cascades burned away; the  inland sea was drained and its bed became a fair and habitable land,  and still the waters gushed through the narrow crevices roaring  seaward. But the Devil had one sorrow. All his children born before the  catastrophe were crabbed, unregenerate, stiff-tailed fiends. After that  event every new-born imp wore a flaccid, invertebrate, despondent  tail--the very last insignium of ignobility. So runs the legend of The  Dalles--a shining lesson to reformers.    Leaving The Dalles in the morning, a splendid panorama begins to unfold  on this lordly stream--\"Achilles of rivers,\" as Winthrop called it. It  is difficult to describe the charm of this trip. Residents of the East  pronounce it superior to the Hudson, and travelers assert there is  nothing like it in the Old World. It is simply delicious to those  escaped from the heat and dust of their far-off homes to embark on this  noble stream and steam smoothly down past frowning headlands and \"rocks  with carven imageries,\" bluffs lined with pine trees, vivid green, past  islands and falls, and distant views of snowy peaks. There is no trip  like it on the coast, and for a river excursion there is not its equal  in the United States.    THE ISLE OF THE DEAD.    Twelve miles below \"The Dalles\" there is a lonely, rugged island anchored  amid stream. It is bare, save for a white monument which rises from its  rocky breast. No living thing, no vestige of verdure, or tree, or shrub,  appears. And Captain McNulty, as he stood at the wheel and steadied the  \"Queen,\" said:    \"That monument? It's Victor Trevet's. Of course you never heard of him,  but he was a great man, all the same, here in Oregon in the old times.  Queer he was, and no mistake. Member of one of the early legislatures;  sort of a general peacemaker; everybody went to him with their troubles,  and when he said a lawsuit didn't go, it didn't, and he always stuck up  for the Indians, and always called his own kind 'dirty mean whites.' I  used to think that was put on, and maybe it was, but anyhow that's the  way he used to talk. And a hundred times he has said to me, 'John, when  I die, I want to be buried on Memaloose Isle.' That's the 'Isle of the  Dead,' which we just passed, and has been from times away back the burial  place of the Chinook Indians. It's just full of 'em. And I says to him,  'Now, Vic., it's fame your after.' 'John,' says he, 'I'll tell you: I'm  not indifferent to glory; and there's many a big gun laid away in the  cemetery that people forget in a year, and his grave's never visited  after a few turns of the wheel; but if I rest on Memaloose Isle, I'll not  be forgotten while people travel this river. And another thing: You know,  John, the dirty, mean whites stole the Indian's burial ground and built  Portland there. Everyday the papers have an account of Mr. Bigbug's  proposed palace, and how Indian bones were turned up in the excavation. I  won't be buried alongside any such dirty, mean thieves. And I'll tell you  further, John, that it may be if I am laid away among the Indians, when  the Great Day comes I can slip in kind of easy. They ain't going to have  any such a hard time as the dirty whites will have, and maybe I won't be  noticed, and can just slide in quiet along with their crowd.'    \"And I tell you,\" said the honest Captain, as he swung the \"Queen\" around  a sharp headland, and the monument and island vanished, \"he has got his  wish. He don't lay among the whites, and there isn't a day in summer when  the name of Vic. Trevet ain't mentioned, either on yon train or on a boat,  just as I am telling it to you now. When he died in San Francisco five  years ago, some of his old friends had him brought back to 'The Dalles,'  and one lovely Sunday (being an off day) we buried him on Memaloose Isle,  and then we put up the monument. His earthly immortality is safe and sure,  for that stone will stand as long as the island stays. She's eight feet  square at the base, built of the native rock right on the island, then  three feet of granite, then a ten-foot column. It cost us $1,500, and  Vic. is bricked up in a vault underneath. Yes, sir, he's there for sure  till resurrection day. Queer idea? Why, blame it all, if he thought he  could get in along with the Chinooks it's all right, ain't it? Don't want  a man to lose any chances, do you?\"    [Illustration: MULTNOMAH FALLS, COLUMBIA RIVER, ORE. On the Union Pacific  Ry.]    So much has been said of this mighty river that the preconceived idea  of the tourist is of a surging flood of unknown depth rushing like a  mountain torrent. The plain facts are that the Lower Columbia is rather  a placid stream, with a sluggish current, and the channel shoals up to  eight feet, then falling to twelve, fifteen and seventeen feet, and  suddenly dropping to 100 feet of water and over. In the spring months  it will rise from twenty-five to forty feet, leaving driftwood high up  among the trees on the banks. The tide ebbs and flows at Portland from  eighteen inches to three feet, according to season, and this tidal  influence is felt, in high water, as far up as the Cascades. It is  fifty miles of glorious beauty from \"The Dalles\" to the Cascades. Here  we leave the steamer and take a narrow-gauge railway for six miles  around the magnificent rapids. At the foot of the Cascades we board a  twin boat, fitted up with equal taste and comfort.    THE MIDDLE COLUMBIA.    Swinging once more down stream we pass hundreds of charming spots, sixty  miles of changeful beauty all the way to Portland; Multnomah Falls, a  filmy veil of water falling 720 feet into a basin on the hillside and  then 130 feet to the river; past the rocky walls of Cape Horn, towering  up a thousand feet; past that curious freak of nature, Rooster Rock, and  the palisades; past Fort Vancouver, where Grant and Sheridan were once  stationed, and just at sunset leaving the Columbia, which by this time  has broadened into noble dimensions, we ascend the Willamette twelve  miles to Portland.
