They landed in Florida, where almost  the entire band was, very properly, destroyed by the Indians. In 1539, de  Soto sailed from Havana, with five hundred and seventy men and two hundred  and twenty-three horses, for an extended exploration. They wandered for  three years throughout what is now the southern part of the United States  from Georgia and South Carolina westward to Arkansas and Missouri. After a  series of almost incredible experiences, de Soto died in 1542, on the banks  of the Mississippi River at a point probably not far from the Red River.  These and other expeditions, from Cuba and from Mexico, to what is now  territory of the United States, produced no permanent results. No gold was  found.    Of the inhabitants of Cuba, as found by the Spaniards, comparatively little  is recorded. They seem to have been a somewhat negative people, generally  described as docile, gentle, generous, and indolent. Their garments were  quite limited, and their customs altogether primitive. They disappear  from Cuba's story in its earliest chapters. Very little is known of their  numbers. Some historians state that, in the days of Columbus, the island  had a million inhabitants, but this is obviously little if anything more  than a rough guess. Humboldt makes the following comment: \"No means now  exist to arrive at a knowledge of the population of Cuba in the time of  Columbus; but how can we admit what some otherwise judicious historians  state, that when the island of Cuba was conquered in 1511, it contained a  million inhabitants of whom only 14,000 remained in 1517. The statistical  information which we find in the writings of Las Casas is filled with  contradictions.\" Forty years or so later the Dominican friar, Luis Bertram,  on his return to Spain, predicted that \"the 200,000 Indians now in the  island of Cuba, will perish, victims to the cruelty of the Europeans.\" Yet  Gomara stated that there was not an Indian in Cuba after 1553. Whatever the  exact truth regarding numbers, it is evident that they disappeared rapidly,  worked to death by severe task-masters. The institution of African slavery,  to take the place of the inefficient and fast disappearing native labor,  had its beginning in 1521. Baron Humboldt states that from that time until  1790, the total number of African negroes imported as slaves was 90,875.  In the next thirty years, the business increased rapidly, and Humboldt  estimates the total arrivals, openly entered and smuggled in, from 1521 to  1820, as 372,449. Mr. J.S. Thrasher, in a translation of Humboldt's work,  issued in 1856, added a footnote showing the arrivals up to 1854 as  644,000. A British official authority, at the same period, gives the total  as a little less than 500,000. The exact number is not important. The  institution on a large scale, in its relation to the total number of  whites, was a fact.    It is, of course, quite impossible even today to argue the question of  slavery. To many, the offence lies in the mere fact; to others, it lies in  the operation of the system. At all events, the institution is no longer  tolerated in any civilized country. While some to whom the system itself  was a bitter offence have found much to criticize in its operation in Cuba,  the general opinion of observers appears to be that it was there notably  free from the brutality usually supposed to attend it. The Census Report of  1899, prepared under the auspices of the American authorities, states that  \"while it was fraught with all the horrors of this nefarious business  elsewhere, the laws for the protection of slaves were unusually humane.  Almost from the beginning, slaves had a right to purchase their freedom or  change their masters, and long before slavery was abolished they could own  property and contract marriage. As a result, the proportion of free colored  to slaves has always been large.\" Humboldt, who studied the institution  while it was most extensive, states that \"the position of the free negroes  in Cuba is much better than it is elsewhere, even among those nations which  have for ages flattered themselves as being most advanced in civilization.\"  The movement for the abolition of slavery had its beginning in 1815, with  the treaty of Vienna, to which Spain was a party. Various acts in the same  direction appear in the next fifty years. The Moret law, enacted in 1870 by  the Spanish Cortes, provided for gradual abolition in Spain's dominions,  and a law of 1880, one of the results of the Ten Years' War, definitely  abolished the system. Traces of it remained, however, until about 1887,  when it may be regarded as having become extinct forever in Cuba.    For the first two hundred and fifty years of Cuba's history, the city of  Havana appears as the special centre of interest. There was growth in other  sections, but it was slow, for reasons that will be explained elsewhere.  In 1538, Havana was attacked and totally destroyed by a French privateer.  Hernando de Soto, then Governor of the island, at once began the  construction of defences that are now one of the special points of interest  in the city. The first was the Castillo de la Fuerza. In 1552, Havana  became the capital city. In 1555, it was again attacked, and practically  destroyed, including the new fortress, by French buccaneers. Restoration  was effected as rapidly as possible. In 1589, La Fuerza was enlarged, and  the construction of the Morro and of La Punta, the fortress at the foot of  the Prado, was begun. The old city wall, of which portions still remain,  was of a later period. Despite these precautions, the city was repeatedly  attacked by pirates and privateers. Some reference to these experiences  will be made in a special chapter on the city. The slow progress of the  island is shown by the fact that an accepted official report gives the  total population in 1775 as 171,620, of whom less than 100,000 were white.  The absence of precious metals is doubtless the main reason for the lack of  Spanish interest in the development of the country. For a long time after  the occupation, the principal industry was cattle raising. Agriculture, the  production of sugar, tobacco, coffee, and other crops, on anything properly  to be regarded as a commercial scale, was an experience of later years. The  reason for this will be found in the mistaken colonial policy of Spain, a  policy the application of which, in a far milder manner, cost England its  richest colony in the Western Hemisphere, and which, in the first quarter  of the 19th Century, cost Spain all of its possessions in this half of the  world, with the exception of Cuba and Porto Rico.          II    _NEW CUBA_      While there is no point in Cuba's history that may be said to mark a  definite division between the Old Cuba and the New Cuba, the beginning of  the 19th Century may be taken for that purpose. Cuba's development dragged  for two hundred and fifty years. The population increased slowly and  industry lagged. For this, Spain's colonial policy was responsible. But it  was the policy of the time, carried out more or less effectively by all  nations having colonies. England wrote it particularly into her Navigation  Acts of 1651, 1660, and 1663, and supported it by later Acts. While not  rigorously enforced, and frequently evaded by the American colonists, the  system at last proved so offensive that the colonists revolted in 1775.  Most of Spain's colonies in the Western Hemisphere, for the same reason,  declared and maintained their independence in the first quarter of the  19th Century. At the bottom of Cuba's several little uprisings, and at the  bottom of its final revolt in 1895, lay the same cause of offence. In those  earlier years, it was held that colonies existed solely for the benefit  of the mother-country. In 1497, almost at the very beginning of Spain's  colonial enterprises in the New World, a royal decree was issued under  which the exclusive privilege to carry on trade with the colonies was  granted to the port of Seville. This monopoly was transferred to the port  of Cadiz in 1717, but it continued, in somewhat modified form in later  years, until Spain had no colonies left.    While Santiago was the capital of the island, from 1522 to 1552, trade  between Spain and the island could be carried on only through that port.  When Havana became the capital, in 1552, the exclusive privilege of trade  was transferred to that city. With the exception of the years 1762 and  1763, when the British occupied Havana and declared it open to all trade,  the commerce of the island could only be done through Havana with Seville,  until 1717, and afterward with Cadiz. Baracoa, or Santiago, or Trinidad,  or any other Cuban city, could not send goods to Santander, or Malaga, or  Barcelona, or any other Spanish market, or receive goods directly from  them. The law prohibited trade between Cuba and all other countries, and  limited all trade between the island and the mother-country to the port of  Havana, at one end, and to Seville or Cadiz, according to the time of the  control of those ports, at the other end. Even intercolonial commerce was  prohibited. At times, and for brief periods, the system was modified to  the extent of special trade licences, and, occasionally, by international  treaties. But the general system of trade restriction was maintained  throughout all of Spain's colonial experience. Between 1778 and 1803, most  of Cuba's ports were opened to trade with Spain. The European wars of the  early years of the 19th Century led to modification of the trade laws, but  in 1809 foreign commerce with Spanish American ports was again prohibited.  A few years later, Spain had lost nearly all its American colonies. A new  plan was adopted in 1818. Under that, Spain sought to hold the trade of  Cuba and Porto Rico by tariffs so highly favorable to merchandise from  the mother-country as to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11487"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

But Schinderhannes, the boldest of the bold, young, active  and subtle, converted the obscure exploits of banditti into the  comparatively magnificent ravages of \"the outlaw and his men;\" and  sometimes marched at the head of sixty or eighty of his troop to the  attack of whole villages. Devoted to pleasure, no fear ever crossed him  in its pursuit; he walked publicly with his mistress, a beautiful girl  of nineteen, in the very place which the evening before had been the  scene of one of his criminal exploits; he frequented the fairs and  taverns, which were crowded with his victims; and such was the terror  he had inspired, that these audacious exposures were made with perfect  impunity. Free, generous, handsome, and jovial, it may even be conceived  that sometime he gained the protection from love which could not have  been extorted by force.    It is scarcely a wonder that with the admirable regulations of the  robbers, they should have succeeded even to so great an extent as they  did in that unsettled country. Not more than two or three of them were  allowed to reside in the same town or village; they were scattered over  the whole face of the district, and apparently connected with each other  only by some mysterious free-masonry of their craft. When a blow was  to be struck, a messenger was sent round by the chief to warn his  followers; and at the mustering place the united band rose up, like the  clan of Roderick Dhu from the heather, to disappear as suddenly again  in darkness when the object was accomplished. Their clothing, names and  nations were changed perpetually; a Jew broker at Cologne would figure  some days after at Aix-la-Chapelle or Spa as a German baron, or a Dutch  merchant, keeping open table, and playing a high game; and the next week  he might be met with in a forest at the head of his troop. Young and  beautiful women were always in their suite, who, particularly in the  task of obtaining or falsifying passports, did more by their address  than their lovers could have effected by their courage. Spies,  principally Jews, were employed throughout the whole country, to give  notice where a booty might be obtained. Spring and autumn were the  principal seasons of their harvest; in winter the roads were almost  impassable, and in summer the days were too long; the light of the moon,  in particular, was always avoided, and so were the betraying foot prints  in the snow. They seldom marched in a body to the place of attack, but  went thither two or three in a party, some on foot, some on horseback,  and some even in carriages. As soon as they had entered a village, their  first care was to muffle the church bell, so as to prevent an alarm  being rung; or to commence a heavy fire, to give the inhabitants an  exaggerated idea of their numbers, and impress them with the feeling  that it would be more prudent to stay at home than to venture out into  the fray.    John Buckler, _alias_ Schinderhannes, the worthy whose youthful arm  wielded with such force a power constituted in this manner, was the son  of a currier, and born at Muhlen, near Nastoeten, on the right bank of  the Rhine. The family intended to emigrate to Poland, but on the way the  father entered the Imperial service at Olmutz, in Moravia. He deserted,  and his wife and child followed him to the frontiers of Prussia, and  subsequently the travellers took up their abode again in the environs  of the Rhine.    At the age of fifteen, Schinderhannes commenced his career of crime by  spending a louis, with which he had been entrusted, in a tavern. Afraid  to return home, he wandered about the fields till hunger compelled him  to steal a horse, which he sold. Sheep stealing was his next vocation,  but in this he was caught and transferred to prison. He made his escape,  however, the first night, and returned in a very business-like manner to  receive two crowns which were due to him on account of the sheep he had  stolen. After being associated with the band as their chief, he went to  buy a piece of linen, but thinking, from the situation of the premises,  that it might be obtained without any exchange of coin on his part, he  returned the same evening, and stealing a ladder in the neighbourhood,  placed it at a window of the warehouse, and got in. A man was writing in  the interior, but the robber looked at him steadily, and shouldering his  booty, withdrew. He was taken a second time, but escaped as before on  the same night.    His third escape was from a dark and damp vault in the prison of  Schneppenbach, where, having succeeded in penetrating to the kitchen,  he tore an iron bar from the window by main force, and leaped out at  hazard. He broke his leg in the fall, but finding a stick, managed  to drag himself along, in the course of three nights, to Birkenmuhl,  without a morsel of food, but on the contrary, having left some ounces  of skin and flesh of his own on the road.    Marianne Schoeffer was the first avowed mistress of Schinderhannes.  She was a young girl of fourteen, of ravishing beauty, and always  \"se mettait avec une elegance extreme.\" Blacken Klos, one of the band,  an unsuccessful suitor of the lady, one day, after meeting with a  repulse, out of revenge carried off her clothes. When the outrage was  communicated to Schinderhannes, he followed the ruffian to a cave where  he had concealed himself, and slew him. It was Julia Blaesius, however,  who became the permanent companion of the young chief. The account  given by her of the manner in which she was united to the destiny of the  robber is altogether improbable. A person came to her, she said, and  mentioned that somebody wished to speak to her in the forest of Dolbach;  she kept the assignation, and found there a handsome young man who told  her that she must follow him--an invitation which she was obliged at  length by threats to accede to. It appears sufficiently evident,  however, that the personal attractions of Schinderhannes, who was then  not twenty-two, had been sufficient of themselves to tempt poor Julia  to her fate, and that of her own accord        \"She fled to the forest to hear a love tale.\"      It may be, indeed, as she affirmed, that she was at first ignorant of  the profession of her mysterious lover, who might address her somewhat  in the words of the Scottish free-booter--        \"A lightsome eye, a soldier's mien--    A bonnet of the blue,    A doublet of the Lincoln green,    'Twas all of me you knew.\"      But it is known that afterwards she even accompanied him personally in  some of his adventures dressed in men's clothes.    The robberies of this noted chief became more audacious and extensive  every day, and at last he established a kind of \"black mail\" among the  Jews, at their own request. Accompanied one day by only two of his  comrades, he did not hesitate to attack a cavalcade of forty-five Jews  and five Christian peasants. The booty taken was only two bundles of  tobacco, the robbers returning some provisions on a remonstrance from  one of the Jews, who pleaded poverty. Schinderhannes then ordered them  to take off their shoes and stockings, which he threw into a heap,  leaving to every one the care of finding his own property. The affray  that ensued was tremendous; the forty-five Jews who had patiently  allowed themselves to be robbed by three men, fought furiously with each  other about their old shoes; and the robber, in contempt of their  cowardice, gave his carbine to one of them to hold while he looked on.    His daring career at length drew to a close, and he and his companions  were arrested by the French authorities, and brought to trial. The  chief, with nineteen others, were condemned to death in November, 1803,  and Julia Blaesius to two years' imprisonment. The former met his fate  with characteristic intrepidity, occupied to the last moment with his  cares about Julia and his father.--_From the Foreign Quarterly  Review.--An excellent work_.           *       *       *       *       *          RESTROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS.           *       *       *       *       *      OLD MANSIONS.      We are in the habit of passing by our old stone manor houses without  knowing that they were important village fortresses, and substitutes for  castles.

When he was brought to the bar, he would  not speak or plead, though often urged to it, and the sentence to be  inflicted on such as stand mute, read to him, in vain. Four or five  persons in the court, swore that they had heard him speak, and the boy  who was his accomplice, and apprehended, was there to be a witness  against him; yet he continued mute; whereupon he was carried back to  Horsham gaol, to be pressed to death, if he would not plead--when they  laid on him 100 weight, then added 100 more, and he still continued  obstinate; they then added 100 more, which made 300 lb. weight, yet he  would not speak; 50 lb. more was added, when he was nearly dead, having  all the agonies of death upon him; then the executioner, who weighed  about 16 or 17 stone, laid down upon the board which was over him, and,  adding to the weight, killed him in an instant.
