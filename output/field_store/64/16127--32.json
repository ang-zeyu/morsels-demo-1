The English drover applied to  the bailiff on the property, who was known to him. It chanced that the  Cumbrian Squire, who had entertained some suspicions of his manager's  honesty, was taking occasional measures to ascertain how far they were  well founded, and had desired that any inquiries about his enclosures,  with a view to occupy them for a temporary purpose, should be referred  to himself. As, however, Mr. Ireby had gone the day before upon a  journey of some miles distance to the northward, the bailiff chose  to consider the check upon his full powers as for the time removed,  and concluded that he should best consult his master's interest  and perhaps his own, in making an agreement with Harry Wakefield.  Meanwhile, ignorant of what his comrade was doing, Robin Oig, on his  side, chanced to be overtaken by a well-looked smart little man upon a  pony, most knowingly hogged and cropped, as was then the fashion, the  rider wearing tight leather breeches, and long-necked bright spurs.  This cavalier asked one or two pertinent questions about markets and  the price of stock. So Donald, seeing him a well-judging, civil  gentleman, took the freedom to ask him whether he could let him know  if there was any grass-land to be let in that neighbourhood, for the  temporary accommodation of his drove. He could not have put the  question to more willing ears. The gentleman of the buckskins was the  proprietor, with whose bailiff Harry Wakefield had dealt, or was in  the act of dealing.    \"Thou art in good luck, my canny Scot,\" said Mr. Ireby, \"to have  spoken to me, for I see thy cattle have done their day's work, and I  have at my disposal the only field within three miles that is to be  let in these parts.\"    \"The drove can pe gang two, three, four miles very pratty weel  indeed--\" said the cautious Highlander; \"put what would his honour pe  axing for the peasts pe the head, if she was to tak the park for twa  or three days?\"    \"We wont differ, Sawney, if you let me have six stots for winterers,  in the way of reason.\"    \"And which peasts wad your honour pe for having?\"    \"Why--let me see--the two black--the dun one--yon doddy--him with the  twisted horn--and brockit--How much by the head?\"    \"Ah,\" said Robin, \"your honour is a shudge--a real shudge--I couldna  have set off the pest six peasts petter myself, me that ken them as if  they were my pairns, puir things.\"    \"Well, how much per head, Sawney,\" continued Mr. Ireby.    \"It was high markets at Doune and Falkirk,\" answered Robin.    And thus the conversation proceeded, until they had agreed on the  _prix juste_ for the bullocks, the Squire throwing in the temporary  accommodation of the enclosure for the cattle into the boot, and Robin  making, as he thought, a very good bargain, providing the grass was  but tolerable. The Squire walked his pony alongside of the drove,  partly to show him the way, and see him put into possession of the  field, and partly to learn the latest news of the northern markets.    They arrived at the field, and the pasture seemed excellent. But what  was their surprise when they saw the bailiff quietly inducting the  cattle of Harry Wakefield into the grassy Goshen which had just been  assigned to those of Robin Oig M'Combich by the proprietor himself.  Squire Ireby set spurs to his horse, dashed up to his servant, and  learning what had passed between the parties, briefly informed the  English drover that his bailiff had let the ground without his  authority, and that he might seek grass for his cattle wherever he  would, since he was to get none there. At the same time he rebuked his  servant severely for having transgressed his commands, and ordered him  instantly to assist in ejecting the hungry and weary cattle of Harry  Wakefield, which were just beginning to enjoy a meal of unusual  plenty, and to introduce those of his comrade, whom the English drover  now began to consider as a rival.    The feelings which arose in Wakefield's mind, would have induced him  to resist Mr. Ireby's decision; but every Englishman has a tolerably  accurate sense of law and justice, and John Fleecebumpkin, the  bailiff, having acknowledged that he had exceeded his commission,  Wakefield saw nothing else for it than to collect his hungry and  disappointed charge, and drive them on to seek quarters elsewhere.  Robin Oig saw what had happened with regret, and hastened to offer  to his English friend to share with him the disputed possession. But  Wakefield's pride was severely hurt, and he answered disdainfully,  \"Take it all man--take it all--never make two bites of a cherry--thou  canst talk over the gentry, and blear a plain man's eye--Out upon you,  man--I would not kiss any man's dirty latchets for leave to bake in  his oven.\"    Robin Oig, sorry but not surprised at his comrade's displeasure,  hastened to entreat his friend to wait but an hour till he had gone  to the Squire's house to receive payment for the cattle he had sold,  and he would come back and help him to drive the cattle into some  convenient place of rest, and explain to him the whole mistake they  had both of them fallen into. But the Englishman continued indignant:  \"Thou hast been selling, hast thou? Ay, ay--thou is a cunning lad for  kenning the hours of bargaining. Go to the devil with thyself, for I  will ne'er see thy fause loon's visage again--thou should be ashamed  to look me in the face.\"    \"I am ashamed to look no man in the face,\" said Robin Oig, something  moved; \"and, moreover, I will look you in the face this blessed day,  if you will bide at the Clachan down yonder.\"    \"Mayhap you had as well keep away,\" said his comrade; and turning his  back on his former friend, he collected his unwilling associates,  assisted by the bailiff, who took some real and some affected interest  in seeing Wakefield accommodated.    After spending some time in negotiating with more than one of the  neighbouring farmers, who could not, or would not, afford the  accommodation desired, Henry Wakefield, at last, and in his necessity,  accomplished his point by means of the landlord of the alehouse at which  Robin Oig and he had agreed to pass the night, when they first separated  from each other. Mine host was content to let him turn his cattle on a  piece of barren moor, at a price little less than the bailiff had asked  for the disputed enclosure; and the wretchedness of the pasture, as well  as the price paid for it, were set down as exaggerations of the breach  of faith and friendship of his Scottish crony. This turn of Wakefield's  passions was encouraged by the bailiff (who had his own reasons for  being offended against poor Robin, as having been the unwitting cause of  his falling into disgrace with his master), as well as by the innkeper,  and two or three chance guests, who soothed the drover in his resentment  against his quondam associate,--some from the ancient grudge against the  Scots, which, when it exists any where, is to be found lurking in the  Border counties, and some from the general love of mischief, which  characterizes mankind in all ranks of life, to the honour of Adam's  children be it spoken. Good John Barleycorn also, who always heightens  and exaggerates the prevailing passions, be they angry or kindly, was  not wanting in his offices on this occasion; and confusion to false  friends and hard masters, was pledged in more than one tankard.    In the meanwhile, Mr. Ireby found some amusement in detaining the  northern drover at his ancient hall. He caused a cold round of beef  to be placed before the Scot in the butler's pantry, together with a  foaming tankard of home-brewed, and took pleasure in seeing the hearty  appetite with which these unwonted edibles were discussed by Robin Oig  M'Combich. The squire himself lighting his pipe, compounded between his  patrician dignity and his love of agricultural gossip, by walking up and  down while he conversed with his guest.    \"I passed another drove,\" said the squire, with one of your countrymen  behind them, they were something less beasts than your drove--doddies  most of them; a big man was with them--none of your kilts though, but  a decent pair of breeches;--d'ye know who he may be?\"    \"Hout ay--that might, could, and would pe Hughie Morrison--I didna  think he could hae peen sae weel up. He has made a day on us; put his  Argyle-shires will have wearied shanks. How far was he pehind?\"    \"I think about six or seven miles,\" answered the squire, \"for I passed  them at the Christenbury Cragg, and I overtook you at the Hollan Bush.  If his beasts be leg-weary, he will be may be selling bargains.\"    \"Na, na, Hughie Morrison is no the man for pargains--ye maun come to  some Highland body like Robin Oig hersell for the like of these;--put  I maun be wishing you good night, and twenty of them, let alane ane,  and I maun down to the Clachan to see if the lad Henry Waakfelt is out  of his humdudgeons yet.\"    The party at the alehouse were still in full talk, and the treachery  of Robin Oig still the theme of conversation, when the supposed  culprit entered the apartment. His arrival, as usually happens in  such a case, put an instant stop to the discussion of which he had  furnished the subject, and he was received by the company assembled  with that chilling silence, which more than a thousand exclamations  tells an intruder that he is unwelcome. Surprised and offended, but  not appalled by the reception which he experienced, Robin entered with  an undaunted, and even a haughty air, attempted no greeting as he saw  he was received with none, and placed himself by the side of the fire,  a little apart from a table, at which Harry Wakefield, the bailiff,  and two or three other persons, were seated.

Be they then  restored, this very Christmas, to the English character; the opportunity  is fast approaching--be it employed.    I know nothing better to conclude with than a good old Christmas carol  from _Poor Robin's Almanack_ for 1695, preserved in Brand's _Popular  Antiquities_, to which work I refer those of my readers who may require  further information on the subject of Christmas customs and  festivities:--      Now, thrice welcome, Christmas!      Which brings us good cheer;    Mince-pies and plum-pudding--      Strong ale and strong beer;    With pig, goose, and capon,      The best that may be:    So well doth the weather      And our stomachs agree.      Observe how the chimneys      Do smoke all about;    The cooks are providing      For dinner no doubt.    But those on whose tables      No victuals appear,    O may they keep Lent      All the rest of the year!      With holly and ivy,      So green and so gay,    We deck up our houses      As fresh as the day;    With bays and rosemary,      And laurel complete,--    And every one now      Is a king in conceit,      But as for curmudgeons      Who will not be free,    I wish they may die      On a two-legged tree!

The men shave  their heads, but wear long beards, and are extremely proud of their  mustaches, which are usually turned downwards, and which give the other  features of the face a cast of peculiar pensiveness. They wear turbans,  sometimes white, of an enormous size on their heads, and never remove  them but when they go to repose. Their breeches, or drawers, are united  with their stockings, and they have slippers, which they never put off  but when they enter a mosque, or the house of a great man. Large shirts  are worn, and over them is a vest tied with a sash; the outer garment  being a sort of loose gown. Every man, in whatever station he is,  carries a dagger in his sash. The women's attire much resembles that of  the other sex, only they have a cap on their heads, something like a  bishop's mitre, instead of a turban. Their hair is beautiful and long,  mostly black, but their faces, which are remarkably handsome, are so  covered when they walk out, that nothing is to be seen but their eyes.  The ladies of the sultan's _haram_ are lovely virgins, either captives  taken during war, or presents from the governors of provinces. They are  never allowed to stir abroad except when the grand signior removes; and  then they are put into close chariots, signals being made at certain  distances that no man may approach the road through which the ladies  pass, on pain of death. There are a great number of female _slaves_ in  the sultan's haram, whose task it is to wait on the ladies, who have,  besides, a black eunuch for their superintendant.    There are three colleges in Turkey where the children of distinguished  men are educated and fitted for state employments. The children are  first approved by the grand signior before they are allowed to enter  these seminaries; and none dare come into his majesty's presence who are  not handsome and well-made. Silence is first taught them, and a becoming  behaviour to their superiors; then they are instructed in the Mahometan  faith, the Turkish and Persian languages, and afterwards in the Arabic.  At the age of twenty-one they are taught all manner of manly exercises,  and above all, the use of arms. As they advance to proficiency in these,  and other useful arts, and as government places become vacant, they are  preferred; but it is to be observed, that they generally attain the age  of forty before they are thought capable of being entrusted with  important slate affairs.    Those who hold any office under the grand signior are called his slaves;  the term slave, in Turkey, signifying the most honourable title a  subject can bear. The grand signior is commonly supposed among his own  people, to be something more than human; for he is not bound by any laws  except that of professing and maintaining the Mahometan religion. A  stranger desiring to be admitted into his majesty's presence, is first  examined by proper persons, and his arms taken from him; he is then  ushered before the royal personage between two strong supporters, but is  not even then permitted to approach near enough to kiss the sultan's  foot.[1] This custom, which is observed by every sultan, originated in  the following manner:--Amurath I. having obtained a great victory over  the Christians, was on the field of battle with his officers viewing the  dead, when a wounded Christian soldier, rising from among the slain,  came staggering towards him. The king, supposing the man intended to beg  for his life, ordered the guards to make way for him; but drawing near,  he drew a dagger from under, his coat, and plunged it into the heart of  the great king, who instantly died.    [1] The ceremony of kissing the foot, as well as the hand, of a  sovereign, is yet observed in the east.    In Turkey, no man marries a deformed wife for the sake of a fortune, as  with us; beauty and good sense, to their credit be it spoken, are the  only inducements to matrimony among the Turks. But they are an indolent  people, and are much averse to improving their country by commerce,  planting, or building; appearing to take delight in letting their  property run to ruin. Alexandria, Tyre, and Sidon, which once commanded  the navigation and trade of the whole world, are at present in the  Turks' possession, but are only very inconsiderable places. Indeed,  observes a judicious author, it is well for us that the Turks are such  an indolent people, for their situation and vast extent of empire, would  enable them to monopolize the trade of the world if they attended to it.  They appear to possess very little genius or inclination for the  improvement of _arts and sciences_ although they live in countries which  were once in the possession of the classic Greeks; but seem to prefer a  slothful mode of life to an active one, continually sauntering away their  time, either among women, or in taking coffee and smoking. Being men of  great taciturnity, they very seldom disturb a stranger with questions; and  a person may live in their country a dozen years, without having twenty  words addressed to him, except on important business. They seldom  travel, and have very little wish to be informed of the state of their  own, or any other country; when a minister of state is turned out of his  place, or strangled, (which is a frequent custom,) they coldly observe  that there will be a new one, without inquiring into the reason of the  disgrace of the former. The doctrine of predestination prevails, and  they therefore think it wicked to endeavour to avoid their fate;  frequently entering houses where they know the plague is raging.    All religions are tolerated in Turkey, though none are encouraged but  the Mahometan faith. The Christians have churches, which the Turks not  unfrequently convert into mosques for their own use; nor will they  suffer any new churches, or temples, to be built, without extorting an  exorbitant fine from the poor Christians. The high-priest of the  Mahometan religion is called the _mufti_; he is invested with great  power, and his seal is necessary to the passing of all acts of state.  But any individual, who pleases to take the habit, may be a priest, and  may leave the office when he is weary of it; for there is nothing like  ordination among them.    G. W. N.      PULQUE.    Pulque, which is the favourite drink of the Mexicans, is extracted from  the Manguey, or Great American Aloe; at the time of throwing its flower  stem, it is hollowed in the centre and the juice which should have  supplied the flowers, is taken from it daily, for about two months;  which juice when fermented is immediately fit for drinking. A very  strong brandy is obtained by distillation. So great is the consumption  that the duty collected at the city gates, amounts annually to 600,000  dollars--_From a Correspondent_.      HATCHING CHICKENS.    The following singular, though effectual mode of hatching chickens,  prevails in the interior of Sumatra; and is vouched for by Major Clayton  of the Bencoolen council:--    The hens, whether from being frightened off their nests by the rats,  which are very numerous and destructive, or from some other cause  hitherto prevalent in Sumatra, do not hatch their chickens in the  ordinary way, as is seen in almost all other climates. The natives have  for this purpose, in each village, several square rooms, the walls of  which are made of a kind of brick, dried in the sun. In the middle of  these rooms they make a large fire, round which they place their eggs at  regular distances. In this manner they let them lie for fourteen days,  now and then turning them, that the warmth may be equal in all parts;  and on the fifteenth day, the chicken makes its appearance, and proves  in every respect as strong as those hatched according to the course of  nature.--_From a Correspondent._    AFRICAN COOKERY.
