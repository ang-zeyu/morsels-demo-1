Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.      Wife. She's not fourteen.      Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-      And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-      She is not fourteen. How long is it now      To Lammastide?      Wife. A fortnight and odd days.      Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,      Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.      Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)      Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;      She was too good for me. But, as I said,      On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;      That shall she, marry; I remember it well.      'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;      And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),      Of all the days of the year, upon that day;      For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,      Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.      My lord and you were then at Mantua.      Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,      When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple      Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,      To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!      Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,      To bid me trudge.      And since that time it is eleven years,      For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,      She could have run and waddled all about;      For even the day before, she broke her brow;      And then my husband (God be with his soul!      'A was a merry man) took up the child.      'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?      Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;      Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,      The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'      To see now how a jest shall come about!      I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,      I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,      And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'      Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.      Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh      To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'      And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow      A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;      A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.      'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?      Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;      Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'      Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.      Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!      Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.      An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.      Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme      I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,      How stands your disposition to be married?      Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.      Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,      I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.      Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,      Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,      Are made already mothers. By my count,      I was your mother much upon these years      That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:      The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.      Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man      As all the world- why he's a man of wax.      Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.      Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.      Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?      This night you shall behold him at our feast.      Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,      And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;      Examine every married lineament,      And see how one another lends content;      And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies      Find written in the margent of his eyes,      This precious book of love, this unbound lover,      To beautify him only lacks a cover.      The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride      For fair without the fair within to hide.      That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,      That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;      So shall you share all that he doth possess,      By having him making yourself no less.      Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men      Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?      Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;      But no more deep will I endart mine eye      Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.                            Enter Servingman.        Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,      my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and      everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you      follow straight.      Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].      Juliet, the County stays.      Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.                                                           Exeunt.          Scene IV.  A street.    Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;  Torchbearers.        Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?      Or shall we on without apology?      Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.      We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,      Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,      Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;      Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke      After the prompter, for our entrance;      But, let them measure us by what they will,      We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.      Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.      Being but heavy, I will bear the light.      Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.      Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes      With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead      So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.      Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings      And soar with them above a common bound.      Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft      To soar with his light feathers; and so bound      I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.      Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.      Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-      Too great oppression for a tender thing.      Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,      Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.      Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.      Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.      Give me a case to put my visage in.      A visor for a visor! What care I      What curious eye doth quote deformities?      Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.      Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in      But every man betake him to his legs.      Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart      Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;      For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,      I'll be a candle-holder and look on;      The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.      Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!      If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire      Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st      Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!      Rom. Nay, that's not so.      Mer. I mean, sir, in delay      We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.      Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits      Five times in that ere once in our five wits.      Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;      But 'tis no wit to go.      Mer. Why, may one ask?      Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.      Mer. And so did I.      Rom. Well, what was yours?      Mer. That dreamers often lie.      Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.      Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.      She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes      In shape no bigger than an agate stone      On the forefinger of an alderman,      Drawn with a team of little atomies      Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;      Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,      The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;      Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;      Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;      Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;      Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,      Not half so big as a round little worm      Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;      Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,      Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,      Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.      And in this state she 'gallops night by night      Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;      O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;      O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;      O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,      Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,      Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.      Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,      And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;      And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail      Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,      Then dreams he of another benefice.      Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,      And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,      Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,      Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon      Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,      And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two      And sleeps again. This is that very Mab      That plats the manes of horses in the night      And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,      Which once untangled much misfortune bodes      This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,      That presses them and learns them first to bear,      Making them women of good carriage.      This is she-      Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!      Thou talk'st of nothing.      Mer. True, I talk of dreams;      Which are the children of an idle brain,      Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;      Which is as thin of substance as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11123"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 01 (#3)"],[1," as in the church hymns.    This impoverishment of the language the century of the great war tried  to remedy in two opposite ways. For the majority the easiest solution  was to borrow from their richer neighbors, and thus originated that  affectation of all things foreign, which, in speaking, led to the most  variegated use and misuse of foreign words. Patriotically-minded men,  on the contrary, endeavored to cultivate the purity of their mother  tongue the while they enriched it; this, above all, was the ambition  of the various \"Linguistic Societies.\" Their activity, though soon  deprived of a wide usefulness by pedantry and a clannish spirit,  prepared the way for great feats of linguistic reorganization. Through  Christian Wolff a philosophic terminology was systematically created;  from Pietism were received new mediums of expression for intimate  conditions of the soul; neither must we quite overlook the fact that  to some extent a new system of German titles and official designations  was associated with the new institutions of the modern state. More  important, however, than these details--which might have been  accomplished by men like Johann Gottfried Herder, Immanuel Kant and  Goethe; like the statesman, Heinrich Freiherr von Stein; and the  warrior, General von Scharnhorst--was this fact that, in general, an  esthetic interest had been again awakened in the language, which too  long had served as a mere tool. Also the slowly developing study of  language was of some help; even the falsest etymology taught people to  look upon words as organisms; even the most superficial grammar, to  observe broad relationships and parallel formations. So, then, the  eighteenth century could, in the treatment of the mother tongue, enter  upon a goodly heritage, of which for a long time Johann Christoph  Gottsched might not unjustly be counted the guardian. It was a  thoroughly conservative linguistic stewardship, which received  gigantic expression in Adelung's Dictionary--with all its  deficiencies, the most important German dictionary that had been  compiled up to that time. Clearness, intelligibleness, exactitude were  insisted upon. It was demanded that there should be a distinct  difference between the language of the writer and that in everyday  use, and again a difference between poetic language and prose; on the  other hand, great care had to be taken that the difference should  never become too great, so that common intelligibility should not  suffer. Thus the new poetic language of Klopstock, precisely on  account of its power and richness, was obliged to submit to the  bitterest mockery and the most injudicious abuse from the partisans of  Gottsched. As the common ideal of the pedagogues of language, who were  by no means merely narrow-minded pedants, one may specify that which  had long ago been accomplished for France--namely, a uniform choice of  a stock of words best suited to the needs of a clear and luminous  literature for the cultivated class, and the stylistic application of  the same. Two things, above all, were neglected: they failed to  realize (as did France also) the continual development of a healthy  language, though the ancients had glimpses of this; and they failed  (this in contrast to France) to comprehend the radical differences  between the various forms of literary composition. Therefore the  pre-classical period still left enough to be done by the classical.    It was Klopstock who accomplished the most; he created a new, a lofty  poetic language, which was to be recognized, not by the use of  conventional metaphors and swelling hyperboles, but by the direct  expression of a highly exalted mood. However, the danger of a forced  overstraining of the language was combatted by Christoph Martin  Wieland, who formed a new and elegant narrative prose on Greek,  French, and English models, and also introduced the same style into  poetic narrative, herein abetted by Friedrich von Hagedorn as his  predecessor and co-worker. Right on the threshold, then, of the great  new German literature another mixture of styles sprang up, and we see,  for example, Klopstock strangely transplanting his pathos into the  field of theoretical researches on grammar and metrics, and Wieland  not always keeping his irony aloof from the most solemn subjects. But  beside them stood Gotthold Ephraim Lessing who proved himself to be  the most thoughtful of the reformers of poetry, in that he emphasized  the divisions--especially necessary for the stylistic development of  German poetry--of literary categories and the arts. The most  far-reaching influence, however, was exercised by Herder, when he  preached that the actual foundation of all poetic treatment of  language was the individual style, and exemplified the real nature of  original style, i. e., inwardly-appropriate modes of expression, by  referring, on the one hand, to the poetry of the people and, on the  other, to Shakespeare or the Bible, the latter considered as a higher  type of popular poetry.    So the weapons lay ready to the hand of the dramatist Lessing, the  lyric poet Goethe, and the preacher Herder, who had helped to forge  them for their own use; for drama, lyrics, and oratory separate  themselves quite naturally from ordinary language, and yet in their  subject matter, in the anticipation of an expectant audience, in the  unavoidable connection with popular forms of speech, in singing, and  the very nature of public assemblies, they have a basis that prevents  them from becoming conventional. But not quite so favorable was the  condition of the different varieties of narrative composition. Here a  peculiarly specific style, such as the French novel especially  possesses, never reached complete perfection. The style of Wieland  would necessarily appear too light as soon as the subject matter of  the novel became more intimate and personal; that of the imitators of  Homer necessarily too heavy. Perhaps here also Lessing's sense of  style might have furnished a model of permanent worth, in the same way  that he furnished one for the comedy and the didactic drama, for the  polemic treatise and the work of scientific research. For is not the  tale of the three rings, which forms the kernel of _Nathan the Wise_,  numbered among the great standard pieces of German elocution, in spite  of all the contradictions and obscurities which have of late been  pointed out in it, but which only the eye of the microscopist can  perceive? In general it is the \"popular philosophers\" who have, more  than any one else, produced a fixed prose style; as a reader of good  but not exclusively classical education once acknowledged to me that  the German of J.J. Engel was more comprehensible to him and seemed  more \"modern\" than that of Goethe. As a matter of fact, the narrator  Goethe, in the enchanting youthful composition of _Werther_, did  venture very close to the lyrical, but in his later novels his style  at times dangerously approached a dry statement of facts, or a  rhetorically inflated declamation; and even in _The Elective  Affinities_, which stands stylistically higher than any of his other  novels, he has not always avoided a certain stiltedness that forms a  painful contrast to the warmth of his sympathy for the characters. On  the other hand, in scientific compositions he succeeded in  accomplishing what had hitherto been unattainable--just because, in  this case, the new language had first to be created by him.    Seldom are even the great writers of the following period quite free  from the danger of a lack-lustre style in their treatment of the  language, above all in narrative composition. It is only in the  present day that Thomas Mann, Jacob Wassermann, and Ricarda Huch are  trying along different lines, but with equal zeal, to form a fixed  individual style for the German prose-epic. The great exceptions of  the middle period, the writers of prose-epics Jeremias Gotthelf and  Gottfried Keller, the novelists Paul Heyse and Marie von  Ebner-Eschenbach, the narrator of anecdotes Ludwig Anzengruber, with  his greater predecessor Johann Peter Hebel, and his lesser  contemporary Peter Rosegger, the portrayer of still-life Adalbert  Stifter and a few others, have, more by a happy instinct than anything  else, hit upon the style proper to their form of composition, lack of  which prevents us from enjoying an endless number of prose works of  the nineteenth century, which, as far as their subject matter goes,  are not unimportant. In this connection I will only mention Karl  Gutzkow's novels describing his own period, or, from an earlier time,  Clemens Brentano's fairy tales, Friedrich Hebbel's humoresques, or  even the rhetorically emotional historical compositions of Heinrich  von Treitschke, found in certain parts of his work. But this lack of a  fixed specific style spread likewise to other forms of composition;  Schiller's drama became too rhetorical; Friedrich Rueckert's lyric  poetry too prosaically didactic; that of Annette von Droste-Huelshoff  often too obscure and sketchy.    If, therefore, the struggle with the language was fought out  successfully by modern German literature only on the battleground of  the lyric (and even there, as we have seen, not without exceptions),  on the other hand a second conservative force was placed at the  service of the literary development with more uniform success, namely  _Metrics_. To be sure, here again this applies only to verse, for the  corresponding art of prose rhythm has been as good as lost to the  Germans, in contrast to the French, and almost more so to the English.  In prose also a conscious and systematic attempt to make an artistic  division into paragraphs, chapters, and books, has only been made in  recent times, above all in and since the writings of Nietzsche. For as  far as the treatment of language in itself is concerned, German  literature has hardly yet fully developed an artistic"]]]
