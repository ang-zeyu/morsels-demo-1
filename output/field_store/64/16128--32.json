A little water which had remained, quenched my burning thirst. I  wished that the waves would rush over me. My hunger soon became  dreadful, but I had no means of relieving it. I endeavoured to sleep,  that I might for awhile, forget my torments; and my wearied frame  yielded for awhile to slumber. When I awoke I was not, however,  refreshed; I was weak, and felt a burning pain at my stomach. I became  hourly more feeble; I lay down, but was unable to rise again. My limbs  lost their strength; my lips and tongue were parched; a convulsive  shuddering agitated me; my eyes seemed darkened, and I gasped for  breath.    The burning at my stomach now departed; I experienced no pain; but a  dull torpor came over me; my hands and feet became cold; I believed I  was dying, and I rejoiced at the thought. Presently I lost all thought  and feeling, and lay, without sense, on a few boards, which divided me  from the ocean. In this situation, as I was afterwards informed, I was  taken up by a small vessel, and carried to a seaport town. I slowly  recovered, and found that I alone, of all who were on board the vessel  in which I had embarked, had escaped death. The crew, who had departed  in the boats, after murdering the captain, had met their reward--the  boats were shattered against a rock.    _December Tales._           *       *       *       *       *        THE SELECTOR, AND LITERARY NOTICES OF NEW WORKS.      A STORM IN THE INDIAN SEAS.      While the sun was setting with even more than its usual brilliancy,  and leaving its path marked with streaks of gold, a bird hovered over  our heads, and suddenly alighted on our taffrail: it was one of  \"Mother Carey's chickens,\" which by mariners are considered as  harbingers of ill, and generally of a furious storm. At a warning of  this kind I did not then feel disposed to take alarm; but there were  other warnings not to be slighted--the horizon to the east presented  the extraordinary appearance of a black cloud in the shape of a bow,  with its convex towards the sea, and which kept its singular shape and  position unchanged until nightfall. For the period too of twenty  minutes after the setting of the sun, the clouds to the north-west  continued of the colour of blood; but that which most attracted our  observation was, to us, a remarkable phenomenon--the sea immediately  around us, and, as far as the eye could discern by the light of the  moon, appeared, for about forty minutes, of a perfectly milk white. We  were visited by two more chickens of Mother Carey, both of which  sought refuge, with our first visiter, on the mainmast. We sounded,  but found no bottom at a hundred fathoms; a bucket of the water was  then drawn up, the surface of which was apparently covered with  innumerable sparks of fire--an effect said to be caused by the  animalculae which abound in sea-water: it is at all times common, but  the sparks are not in general so numerous, nor of such magnitude, as  were those which then presented themselves. The hand too, being dipped  in the water, and immediately withdrawn, thousands of them would seem  to adhere to it. A dismal hollow breeze, which, as the night drew on,  howled through our rigging, and infused into us all a sombre,  melancholy feeling, increased by gathering clouds, and the altogether  portentous state of the atmosphere and elements, ushered in the first  watch, which was to be kept by Thomson.    About eight o'clock, loud claps of thunder, each in kind resembling a  screech, or the blast of a trumpet, rather than the rumbling sound of  thunder in Europe, burst over our heads, and were succeeded by vivid  flashes of forked lightning. We now made every necessary preparation  for a storm, by striking the top-gallant-masts, with their yards,  close reefing the topsails and foresail, bending the storm-staysail,  and battening down the main hatch, over which two tarpaulins were  nailed, for the better preservation of the cargo. We observed  innumerable shoals of fishes, the motions of which appeared to be more  than usually vivid and redundant.    At twelve o'clock, on my taking charge of the deck, the scene bore a  character widely different from that which it presented but three  hours before. We now sailed under close-reefed maintopsail and  foresail. The sea ran high; our bark laboured hard, and pitched  desperately, and the waves lashed her sides with fury, and were  evidently increasing in force and size. Over head nothing was to be  seen but huge travelling clouds, called by sailors the \"scud,\" which  hurried onwards with the fleetness of the eagle in her flight. Now and  then the moon, then in her second quarter, would show her disc for an  instant, but be quickly obscured; or a star of \"paly\" light peep out,  and also disappear. The well was sounded, but the vessel did not yet  make more water than what might be expected in such a sea; we,  however, kept the pumps going at intervals, in order to prevent the  cargo from sustaining damage. The wind now increased, and the waves  rose higher; about two o'clock A.M. the weather maintopsail-sheet gave  way; the sail then split to ribbons, and before we could clue it up,  was completely blown away from the bolt-rope. The foresail was then  furled, not without great difficulty, and imminent hazard to the  seamen, the storm staysail alone withstanding the mighty wind, which  seemed to gain strength every half-hour, while the sea, in frightful  sublimity, towered to an incredible height, frequently making a  complete breach over our deck.    At four A.M. I was relieved by Thomson, who at daylight apprized me  that the maintopmast was sprung, and that the gale was increasing.  Scarcely had I gone on deck, when a tremendous sea struck us a little  \"abaft the beam,\" carrying every thing before it, and washing  overboard hencoops, cables, water-casks, and indeed every movable  article on the deck. Thomson, almost by miracle, escaped being lost;  but having, in common with the lascars, taken the precaution to lash a  rope round his waist, we were able, by its means, to extricate him  from danger; at the same time the vessel made an appalling lurch,  lying down on her beam-ends, in which position she remained for the  space of two minutes, when the maintopmast, followed by the  foretopmast, went by the board with a dreadful crash; she then  righted, and we were all immediately engaged in going aloft, and with  hatchets cutting away the wreck, each of us being lashed with a rope  round the waist; ropes were also fastened across the deck, in parallel  lines, to hold on by; for such was the violence of the vessel's  motion, that without such assistance it would have been impossible to  stand. As for my Virginia, she was in her cot, hearing all that was  going forward on deck,--sensible of her danger, and a prey to the  apprehension of meeting a death similar to that of her prototype, and  equally dreadful.    A drizzling shower now came on, and having continued for some time,  was at length succeeded by heavy rain, which having been converted  into sleet, was carried in flakes swiftly along the tops of the  towering mountains of sea; while the cold sensibly affected the  already exhausted lascars, at once disinclining them from exertion,  and incapacitating them from making any; some of them even sat down  like inanimate statues, with a fixed stare, and a deathlike hue upon  their countenances: the most afflicting circumstance was, their being  destitute of warm clothing, which they had neglected to provide  themselves with, as they ought to have done, out of the four months'  advance they received in Calcutta. All that I could spare was given to  Thomson; but unable to endure the sight of their misery, I distributed  among them many articles which I could ill spare,--sheets, shirts,  and blankets, except one of the latter, which I had reserved as a  provision against any further extreme of suffering which might yet  await us. There was one poor lascar, a simple inoffensive youth, about  nineteen, who was an object of the liveliest commiseration; he was  nearly naked, and in that state had been continually drenched by the  sea and rain, during the whole of the day and night; he was holding  his hands up to heaven in a supplicating attitude, and shaking  in an aguish fit; the tears fell in torrents down his cheeks,  while he uttered his plaints in loud and piercing lamentations.  Unable, at last, to witness his misery any longer, I rushed  down to my cabin--\"Can you, Virginia, spare me this blanket without  feeling the cold too much yourself?--it is to save the life of a  fellow-creature.\"--\"Yes, take it; but stay with me, or, under the  horrors I feel, I shall die in this cabin, and alone. I know we must  perish, and why not die together?\" I entreated her to support herself  with all the fortitude she could collect, urged the impossibility of  my keeping her company, as every moment called for my assistance; and  assuring her there was no real danger, I hurried on deck with the  blanket, and wrapped the poor wretch in its folds. I thought he  would have worshipped me.           *       *       *       *       *    It was about four o'clock, on the fifth morning, that I ventured  into my cabin, to repose myself on my cot until daylight, more with  the persuasion that my presence would inspire Virginia with fresh  hopes, and, in consequence, better spirits, than that the storm had  in the least abated, or that the peril had become less imminent.  At six, Thomson, whom I had left in charge of the deck, aroused  me by bawling, in a voice necessarily raised to the highest pitch,  to make itself heard amidst the howling, or rather screaming of the  elements--\"Naufragus!\" I instantly jumped up, without waiting any  specific communication, and, on reaching the deck, found the pumps at  work, and was informed that we had five feet water in the hold, and  that the water was gaining upon us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11385"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 446, July 19, 1884 (#3)"],[1," drawn to it, with the result of developing  improvements, so that it is now utilized in many ways.    The need in the West of a motive power where water power is rare and  fuel expensive has done much to develop and perfect wind mills.    Wind mills, as at present constructed in this country, are of recent  date.    The mill known as the \"Eclipse\" was the first mill of its class built.  It is known as the \"solid-wheel, self-regulating pattern,\" and was  invented about seventeen years ago. The wind wheel is of the rosette  type, built without any joints, which gives it the name \"solid wheel,\"  in contradistinction to wheels made with loose sections or fans hinged  to the arms or spokes, and known as \"section wheel mills.\"    The regulation of the Eclipse mill is accomplished by the use of a small  adjustable side vane, flexible or hinged rudder vane, and weighted  lever, as shown in Plate 1 (on the larger sizes of mills iron balls  attached to a chain are used in place of the weighted lever). The side  vane and weight on lever being adjustable, can be set to run the mill at  any desired speed.    Now you will observe from the model that the action of the governing  mechanism is automatic. As the velocity of the wind increases, the  pressure on the side vane tends to carry the wind wheel around edgewise  to the wind and parallel to the rudder vane, thereby changing the angle  and reducing the area exposed to the wind; at the same time the lever,  with adjustable weight attached, swings from a vertical toward a  horizontal position, the resistance increasing as it moves toward the  latter position. This acts as a counterbalance of varying resistance  against the pressure of the wind on the side vane, and holds the mill at  an angle to the plane of the wind, insuring thereby the number of  revolutions per minute required, according to the position to which the  governing mechanism has been set or adjusted.    If the velocity of the wind is such that the pressure on the side vane  overcomes the resistance of the counter weight, then the side vane is  carried around parallel with the rudder vane, presenting only the edge  of the wind wheel or ends of the fans to the wind, when the mill stops  running.    This type of mill presents more effective wind receiving or working  surface when in the wind, and less surface exposed to storms when out of  the wind, than any other type of mill. It is at all times under the  control of an operator on the ground.    A 22-foot Eclipse mill presents 352 square feet of wind receiving and  working surface in the wind, and only 91/2 square feet of wind resisting  surface when out of the wind.    Solid-wheel mills are superseding all others in this country, and are  being exported largely to all parts of the world, in sizes from 10 to 30  feet in diameter. Many of these mills have withstood storms without  injury, where substantial buildings in the immediate vicinity have been  badly damaged. I will refer to some results accomplished with pumping  mills:    In the spring of 1881 there was erected for Arkansas City, Kansas, a  14-foot diameter pumping wind mill; a 32,000-gallon water tank, resting  on a stone substructure 15 feet high, the ground on which it stands  being 4 feet higher than the main street of the town. One thousand four  hundred feet of 4-inch wood pipe was used for mains, with 1,200 feet of  11/2-inch wrought iron pipe. Three 3-inch fire hydrants were placed on the  main street. The wind mill was located 1,100 feet from the tank, and  forced the water this distance, elevating it 50 feet. We estimate that  this mill is pumping from 18,000 to 20,000 gallons of water every  twenty-four hours. We learned that these works have saved two buildings  from burning, and that the water is being used for sprinkling the  streets, and being furnished to consumers at the following rates per  annum: Private houses, $5; stores, $5; hotels, $10; livery stables, $15.  At these very low rates, the city has an income of $300 per annum. The  approximate cost of the works was $2,000. This gives 15 per cent.  interest on the investment, not deducting anything for repairs or  maintenance, which has not cost $5 per annum so far.    [Illustration: Plate 2. THE ECLIPSE WIND MILL.]    In June, 1883, a wind water works system was erected for the city of  McPherson, Kansas, consisting of a 22-foot diameter wind mill on a  75-foot tower, which pumps the water out of a well 80 feet deep, and  delivers it into a 60,000-gallon tank resting on a substructure 43 feet  above the ground. Sixteen hundred feet of 6-inch and 300 feet of 4-inch  cast iron pipe furnish the means of distribution; eight 21/2-inch double  discharge fire hydrants were located on the principal streets. A gate  valve was placed in the 6-inch main close to the elbow on lower end of  the down pipe from the tank. This pipe is attached to the bottom of the  tank; another pipe was run up through the bottom of tank 9 feet (the  tank being 18 feet deep), and carried down to a connection with the main  pipe just outside the gate valve. The operation of this arrangement is  as follows:    The gate valve being closed, the water cannot be drawn below the 9-foot  level in tank, which leaves about 35,000 gallons in store for fire  protection, and is at once available by opening the gate valve referred  to. The tank rests on ground about 5 feet above the main streets, which  gives a head of 57 feet when the tank is half full. The distance from  tank to the farthest hydrant being so short, they get the pressure due  to this head at the hydrant, when playing 2-inch, or 1-1/8-inch streams,  with short lines of 21/2-inch hose; this gives fair fire streams for a  town with few if any buildings over two stories high. It is estimated  that this mill is pumping from 30,000 to 38,000 gallons on an average  every twenty-four hours. There is an automatic device attached to this  mill, which stops it when the tank is full, but as soon as the water in  the tank is lowered, it goes to pumping again. The cost of these works  complete to the city was a trifle over $6,000.    In November last a wind mill 18 feet in diameter was erected over a coal  mine at Richmond, in this State. The conditions were as follows:    The mine produces 11,000 gallons of water every twenty-four hours. The  sump holds 11,000 gallons. Two entries that can be dammed up give a  storage of 16,500 gallons, making a total storage capacity of 27,500  gallons. It takes sixty hours for the mine to produce this quantity of  water, which allows for days that the wind does not blow. The average  elevation that the water has to be raised is 65 feet, measuring from  center of sump to point of delivery. A record of ninety days shows that  this mill has kept the mine free from water with the exception of 6,000  gallons, which was raised in the boxes that the coal is raised in. The  location is not good for a wind mill, as it stands in a narrow ravine or  valley a short distance from its mouth, which terminates at the bottom  lands of the Missouri River. This, taken in connection with the fact  that the grit in the water cuts the pump plunger packing so fast that in  a short time the pump will not work up to its capacity, accounts for the  apparent small amount of power developed by this mill.    There has been some discussion of late in regard to the horse power of  wind mills, one party claiming that they were capable of doing large  amounts of grinding and showing a development of power that was  surprising to the average person unacquainted with wind mills, while the  other party has maintained that they were not capable of developing any  great amount of power, and has cited their performance in pumping water  to sustain his argument. My experience has has led me to the conclusion  that pumping water with a wind mill is not a fair test of the power that  it is capable of developing, for the following reasons:    A pumping wind mill is ordinarily attached to a pump of suitable size to  allow the mill to run at a mean speed in an 8 to 10 mile wind. Now, if  the wind increases to a velocity of 16 to 20 miles per hour, the mill  will run up to its maximum speed and the governor will begin to act,  shortening sail before the wind attains this velocity. Therefore, by a  very liberal estimate, the pump will not throw more than double the  quantity that it did in the 8 to 10 mile wind, while the power of the  mill has quadrupled, and is capable of running at least two pumps as  large as the one to which it is attached. As the velocity of the wind  increases, this same proportion of difference in power developed to work  done holds good.    St. Louis is not considered a very windy place, therefore the following  table may be a surprise to some. This table was compiled from the  complete record of the year 1881, as recorded by the anemometer of the  United States Signal Office on the Mutual Life Insurance Building,  corner of Sixth and Locust streets, this city. It gives the number of  hours each month that the wind blew at each velocity, from 6 to 20 miles  per hour during the year; also the maximum velocity attained each month.    _Complete Wind Record at St. Louis for the Year 1881._    _______________________________________________________________________________        |No.    |No.    |No.    |No.    |No.    |No.    |No.    |No.    |        |hours  |hours  |hours  |hours  |hours  |hours  |hours  |hours  |Maximum        |wind   |wind   |wind   |wind   |wind   |wind   |wind   |wind   |velocity  YEAR  |blew 6 |blew 8 |blew 10|blew 12|blew 14|blew 16|blew 18|blew 20|during  1881. |miles  |miles  |miles  |miles  |miles  |miles  |miles  |miles  |each  MONTHS|or over|or over|or over|or over|or over|or over|or over|or over|month.  ______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|____        |H.
