In the 9th of the same reign the Commons presented him their  Speaker; as they did likewise in the 11th year. Soon after this Queen  Jane, granted to him for his good service, the manor of Woodstock,  Hannerborough and Wotten during life; and in the 13th year, he was  again presented Speaker as he was in the 2d of Henry V, and much  about that time he was sent by the king, to treat of a marriage  with Catherine daughter to the duke of Burgundy; he was sent again  ambassador to France, and passed thro' a great many public stations.  Mr. Stebbing says that he was knighted, but we find no such title  given him in any record. He died at Ewelm, the chief place of his  residence, in the year 1434. By his wife Maud he had one daughter  named Alice, who was thrice married, first to Sir John Philips, and  afterwards to Thomas Montacute earl of Salisbury: her third husband  was the famous William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, who lost his head  by the fury of the Yorkists, who dreaded his influence in the opposite  party, tho' he stood proscribed by the parliament of Henry VI. for  misguiding that easy prince. Their son John had three sons, the second  of whom, Edmund, forfeited his life to the crown for treason against  Henry VII, by which means the estates which Chaucer's family possessed  came to the crown. But to return to our poet: By means of the duke  of Lancaster's marriage with his sister in law, he again grew to a  considerable share of wealth; but being now about seventy years of  age, and fatigued with a tedious view of hurried greatness, he quitted  the stage of grandeur where he had acted so considerable a part with  varied success, and retired to Dunnigton castle[3] near Newbury, to  reflect at leisure upon past transactions in the still retreats of  contemplation. In this retirement did he spend his few remaining  years, universally loved and honoured; he was familiar with all men of  learning in his time, and contracted friendship with persons of the  greatest eminence as well in literature as politics; Gower, Occleve,  Lidgate, Wickliffe were great admirers, and particular friends  of Chaucer; besides he was well acquainted with foreign poets,  particularly Francis Petrarch the famous Italian poet, and refiner of  the language. A Revolution in England soon after this happened,  in which we find Chaucer but little concerned; he made no mean  compliments to Henry IV, but Gower his cotemporary, though then very  old, flattered the reigning prince, and insulted the memory of his  murdered Sovereign. All acts of parliament and grants in the last  reign being annulled, Chaucer again repaired to Court to get fresh  grants, but bending with age and weakness, tho' he was successful in  his request, the fatigue of attendance so overcame him, that death  prevented his enjoying his new possessions. He died the 25th of  October in the year 1400, in the second of Henry IV, in the 72d of  his age, and bore the shock of death with the same fortitude and  resignation with which he had undergone a variety of pressures, and  vicissitudes of fortune.    Dryden says, he was poet laureat to three kings, but Urry is of  opinion that Dryden must be mistaken, as among all his works not one  court poem is to be found, and Selden observes, that he could find no  poet honoured with that title in England before the reign of Edward  IV, to whom one John Kaye dedicated the Siege of Rhodes in prose by  the title of his Humble Poet Laureat.    I cannot better display the character of this great man than in the  following words of Urry. \"As to his temper, says he, he had a mixture  of the gay, the modest and the grave. His reading was deep and  extensive, his judgment sound and discerning; he was communicative of  his knowledge, and ready to correct or pass over the faults of his  cotemporary writers. He knew how to judge of and excuse the slips of  weaker capacities, and pitied rather than exposed the ignorance of  that age. In one word, he was a great scholar, a pleasant wit, a  candid critic, a sociable companion, a stedfast friend, a great  philosopher, a temperate oeconomist, and a pious christian.\" As to  his genius as a poet, Dryden (than whom a higher authority cannot be  produced) speaking of Homer and Virgil, positively asserts, that our  author exceeded the latter, and stands in competition with the former.    His language, how unintelligible soever it may seem, is almost as  modern as any of his cotemporaries, or of those who followed him at  the distance of 50 or 60 years, as Harding, Skelton and others, and  in some places it is so smooth and beautiful, that Dryden would not  attempt to alter it; I shall now give some account of his works in  the order in which they were written, so far as can be collected from  them, and subjoin a specimen of his poetry, of which profession as he  may justly be called the Morning Star, so as we descend into later  times; we may see the progress of poetry in England from its great  original, Chaucer, to its full blaze, and perfect consummation in  Dryden.    Mr. Philips supposes a greater part of his works to be lost, than what  we have extant of him; of that number may be many a song, and many a  lecherous lay, which perhaps might have been written by him while he  was a student at Cambridge.    The Court of Love, as has been before observed, was written while he  resided at Cambridge in the 18th year of his age.    The Craft Lovers was written in the year of our Lord, 1348, and  probably the Remedy of Love was written about that time, or not long  after.    The Lamentation of Mary Magdalen taken from Origen, was written by him  in his early years, and perhaps Boethius de Consolatione Philosophiae  was translated by him about the same time.    The Romaunt of the Rose, is a translation from the French: this poem  was begun by William de Lerris, and continued by John de Meun, both  famous French poets; it seems to have been translated about the  time of the rise of Wickliffe's Opinions, it consisting of violent  invectives against religious orders.    The Complaint of the Black Knight, during John of Gaunt's courtship  with Blanch is supposed to be written on account of the duke of  Lancaster's marriage.    The poem of Troilus and Creseide was written in the early part of  his life, translated (as he says) from Lollius an historiographer in  Urbane in Italy; he has added several things of his own, and borrowed  from others what he thought proper for the embellishment of this work,  and in this respect was much indebted to his friend Petrarch the  Italian poet.    The House of Fame; from this poem Mr. Pope acknowledges he took the  hint of his Temple of Fame.    The book of Blaunch the Duchess, commonly called the Dreme of Chaucer,  was written upon the death of that lady.    The Assembly of Fowls (or Parlement of Briddis, as he calls it in his  Retraction) was written before the death of queen Philippa.    The Life of St. Cecilia seems to have been first a single poem,  afterwards made one of his Canterbury Tales which is told by the  second Nonne: and so perhaps was that of the Wife of Bath, which he  advises John of Gaunt to read, and was afterwards inserted in his  Canterbury Tales.    The Canterbury Tales were written about the year 1383. It is certain  the Tale of the Nonnes Priest was written after the Insurrection of  Jack Straw and Wat Tyler.    The Flower and the Leaf was written by him in the Prologue to the  Legend of Gode Women.    Chaucer's ABC, called la Priere de nostre Dame, was written for the  use of the duchess Blaunch.    The book of the Lion is mentioned in his Retraction, and by Lidgate in  the prologue to the Fall of Princes, but is now lost, as is that.    De Vulcani vene, i. e. of the Brocke of Vulcan, which is likewise  mentioned by Lidgate.    La belle Dame sans Mercy, was translated from the French of Alain  Chartier, secretary to Lewis XI, king of France.    The Complaint of Mars and Venus was translated from the French of Sir  Otes de Grantson, a French poet.    The Complaint of Annilida to false Arcite.    The Legend of Gode Women (called the Assembly of Ladies, and by some  the Nineteen Ladies) was written to oblige the queen, at the request  of the countess of Pembroke.    The treatise of the Conclusion of the Astrolabie was written in the  year 1391.    Of the Cuckow and Nightingale, this seems by the description to have  been written at Woodstock.    The Ballade beginning In Feverre, &c. was a compliment to the countess  of Pembroke.    Several other ballads are ascribed to him, some of which are justly  suspected not to have been his. The comedies imputed to him are no  other than his Canterbury Tales, and the tragedies were those the  monks tell in his Tales.    The Testament of Love was written in his trouble the latter part of  his life.    The Song beginning Fly fro the Prese, &c. was written in his  death-bed.    Leland says, that by the content of the learned in his time, the  Plowman's Tale was attributed to Chaucer, but was suppressed in the  edition then extant, because the vices of the clergy were exposed in  it. Mr. Speight in his life of Chaucer, printed in 1602, mentions a  tale in William Thynne's first printed book of Chaucer's works more  odious to the clergy than the Plowman's Tale. One thing must not be  omitted concerning the works of Chaucer. In the year 1526 the bishop  of London prohibited a great number of books which he thought had a  tendency to destroy religion and virtue, as did also the king in 1529,  but in so great esteem were his works then, and so highly valued by  the people of taste, that they were excepted out of the prohibition of  that act.

Taug saw him depart, and then, quite casually, the big beast hunted  closer and closer to Teeka in his search for food.  At last he was  within a few feet of her, and when he shot a covert glance at her he  saw that she was appraising him and that there was no evidence of anger  upon her face.    Taug expanded his great chest and rolled about on his short legs,  making strange growlings in his throat.  He raised his lips, baring his  fangs.  My, but what great, beautiful fangs he had! Teeka could not but  notice them.  She also let her eyes rest in admiration upon Taug's  beetling brows and his short, powerful neck.  What a beautiful creature  he was indeed!    Taug, flattered by the unconcealed admiration in her eyes, strutted  about, as proud and as vain as a peacock.  Presently he began to  inventory his assets, mentally, and shortly he found himself comparing  them with those of his rival.    Taug grunted, for there was no comparison.  How could one compare his  beautiful coat with the smooth and naked hideousness of Tarzan's bare  hide? Who could see beauty in the stingy nose of the Tarmangani after  looking at Taug's broad nostrils? And Tarzan's eyes! Hideous things,  showing white about them, and entirely unrimmed with red.  Taug knew  that his own blood-shot eyes were beautiful, for he had seen them  reflected in the glassy surface of many a drinking pool.    The bull drew nearer to Teeka, finally squatting close against her.  When Tarzan returned from his hunting a short time later it was to see  Teeka contentedly scratching the back of his rival.    Tarzan was disgusted.  Neither Taug nor Teeka saw him as he swung  through the trees into the glade.  He paused a moment, looking at them;  then, with a sorrowful grimace, he turned and faded away into the  labyrinth of leafy boughs and festooned moss out of which he had come.    Tarzan wished to be as far away from the cause of his heartache as he  could.  He was suffering the first pangs of blighted love, and he  didn't quite know what was the matter with him.  He thought that he was  angry with Taug, and so he couldn't understand why it was that he had  run away instead of rushing into mortal combat with the destroyer of  his happiness.    He also thought that he was angry with Teeka, yet a vision of her many  beauties persisted in haunting him, so that he could only see her in  the light of love as the most desirable thing in the world.    The ape-boy craved affection.  From babyhood until the time of her  death, when the poisoned arrow of Kulonga had pierced her savage heart,  Kala had represented to the English boy the sole object of love which  he had known.    In her wild, fierce way Kala had loved her adopted son, and Tarzan had  returned that love, though the outward demonstrations of it were no  greater than might have been expected from any other beast of the  jungle.  It was not until he was bereft of her that the boy realized  how deep had been his attachment for his mother, for as such he looked  upon her.    In Teeka he had seen within the past few hours a substitute for  Kala--someone to fight for and to hunt for--someone to caress; but now  his dream was shattered.  Something hurt within his breast.  He placed  his hand over his heart and wondered what had happened to him.  Vaguely  he attributed his pain to Teeka.  The more he thought of Teeka as he  had last seen her, caressing Taug, the more the thing within his breast  hurt him.    Tarzan shook his head and growled; then on and on through the jungle he  swung, and the farther he traveled and the more he thought upon his  wrongs, the nearer he approached becoming an irreclaimable misogynist.    Two days later he was still hunting alone--very morose and very  unhappy; but he was determined never to return to the tribe.  He could  not bear the thought of seeing Taug and Teeka always together.  As he  swung upon a great limb Numa, the lion, and Sabor, the lioness, passed  beneath him, side by side, and Sabor leaned against the lion and bit  playfully at his cheek.  It was a half-caress. Tarzan sighed and hurled  a nut at them.    Later he came upon several of Mbonga's black warriors.  He was upon the  point of dropping his noose about the neck of one of them, who was a  little distance from his companions, when he became interested in the  thing which occupied the savages.  They were building a cage in the  trail and covering it with leafy branches.  When they had completed  their work the structure was scarcely visible.    Tarzan wondered what the purpose of the thing might be, and why, when  they had built it, they turned away and started back along the trail in  the direction of their village.    It had been some time since Tarzan had visited the blacks and looked  down from the shelter of the great trees which overhung their palisade  upon the activities of his enemies, from among whom had come the slayer  of Kala.    Although he hated them, Tarzan derived considerable entertainment in  watching them at their daily life within the village, and especially at  their dances, when the fires glared against their naked bodies as they  leaped and turned and twisted in mimic warfare.  It was rather in the  hope of witnessing something of the kind that he now followed the  warriors back toward their village, but in this he was disappointed,  for there was no dance that night.    Instead, from the safe concealment of his tree, Tarzan saw little  groups seated about tiny fires discussing the events of the day, and in  the darker corners of the village he descried isolated couples talking  and laughing together, and always one of each couple was a young man  and the other a young woman.    Tarzan cocked his head upon one side and thought, and before he went to  sleep that night, curled in the crotch of the great tree above the  village, Teeka filled his mind, and afterward she filled his  dreams--she and the young black men laughing and talking with the young  black women.    Taug, hunting alone, had wandered some distance from the balance of the  tribe.  He was making his way slowly along an elephant path when he  discovered that it was blocked with undergrowth.  Now Taug, come into  maturity, was an evil-natured brute of an exceeding short temper.  When  something thwarted him, his sole idea was to overcome it by brute  strength and ferocity, and so now when he found his way blocked, he  tore angrily into the leafy screen and an instant later found himself  within a strange lair, his progress effectually blocked,  notwithstanding his most violent efforts to forge ahead.    Biting and striking at the barrier, Taug finally worked himself into a  frightful rage, but all to no avail; and at last he became convinced  that he must turn back.  But when he would have done so, what was his  chagrin to discover that another barrier had dropped behind him while  he fought to break down the one before him! Taug was trapped.  Until  exhaustion overcame him he fought frantically for his freedom; but all  for naught.    In the morning a party of blacks set out from the village of Mbonga in  the direction of the trap they had constructed the previous day, while  among the branches of the trees above them hovered a naked young giant  filled with the curiosity of the wild things.  Manu, the monkey,  chattered and scolded as Tarzan passed, and though he was not afraid of  the familiar figure of the ape-boy, he hugged closer to him the little  brown body of his life's companion.  Tarzan laughed as he saw it; but  the laugh was followed by a sudden clouding of his face and a deep sigh.    A little farther on, a gaily feathered bird strutted about before the  admiring eyes of his somber-hued mate.  It seemed to Tarzan that  everything in the jungle was combining to remind him that he had lost  Teeka; yet every day of his life he had seen these same things and  thought nothing of them.    When the blacks reached the trap, Taug set up a great commotion.  Seizing the bars of his prison, he shook them frantically, and all the  while he roared and growled terrifically.  The blacks were elated, for  while they had not built their trap for this hairy tree man, they were  delighted with their catch.    Tarzan pricked up his ears when he heard the voice of a great ape and,  circling quickly until he was down wind from the trap, he sniffed at  the air in search of the scent spoor of the prisoner.  Nor was it long  before there came to those delicate nostrils the familiar odor that  told Tarzan the identity of the captive as unerringly as though he had  looked upon Taug with his eyes.  Yes, it was Taug, and he was alone.    Tarzan grinned as he approached to discover what the blacks would do to  their prisoner.  Doubtless they would slay him at once.  Again Tarzan  grinned.  Now he could have Teeka for his own, with none to dispute his  right to her.  As he watched, he saw the black warriors strip the  screen from about the cage, fasten ropes to it and drag it away along  the trail in the direction of their village.    Tarzan watched until his rival passed out of sight, still beating upon  the bars of his prison and growling out his anger and his threats.  Then the ape-boy turned and swung rapidly off in search of the tribe,  and Teeka.    Once, upon the journey, he surprised Sheeta and his family in a little  overgrown clearing.  The great cat lay stretched upon the ground, while  his mate, one paw across her lord's savage face, licked at the soft  white fur at his throat.    Tarzan increased his speed then "]]]
