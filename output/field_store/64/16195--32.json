[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12630"],[0,"The Adventures of Old Mr. Toad (#3)"],[1," use your eyes or your ears.\"    Peter looked more foolish than ever. But he ventured another question. It  wouldn't be Peter to let a chance for questions go by. \"Have I ever heard  you singing up on the meadows or in the Old Orchard?\"    \"No,\" replied Old Mr. Toad, \"I only sing in the springtime. That's the time  for singing. I just _have_ to sing then. In the summer it is too hot, and  in the winter I sleep. I always return to my old home to sing. You know I  was born here. All my family gathers here in the spring to sing, so of  course I come too.\"    Old Mr. Toad filled out his queer music bag under his chin and began to  sing again. Peter watched him. Now it just happened that Old Mr. Toad was  facing him, and so Peter looked down straight into his eyes. He never had  looked into Mr. Toad's eyes before, and now he just stared and stared, for  it came over him that those eyes were very beautiful, very beautiful  indeed.    \"Oh!\" he exclaimed, \"what beautiful eyes you have, Mr. Toad!\"    \"So I've been told before,\" replied Old Mr. Toad. \"My family always has had  beautiful eyes. There is an old saying that every Toad has jewels in his  head, but of course he hasn't, not real jewels. It is just the beautiful  eyes. Excuse me, Peter, but I'm needed in that chorus.\" Old Mr. Toad once  more swelled out his throat and began to sing.    Peter watched him a while longer, then hopped away to the dear Old  Briarpatch, and he was very thoughtful.    \"Never again will I call anybody homely and ugly until I know all about  him,\" said Peter, which was a very wise decision. Don't you think so?          VII      A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE SMILING POOL      Here's what Mr. Toad says;      Heed it well, my dear:    \"Time to watch for clouds is     When the sky is clear.\"    He says that that is the reason that he lives to a good old age, does Old  Mr. Toad. I suppose he means that when the sky is cloudy, everybody is  looking for rain and is prepared for it, but when the sun is shining, most  people forget that there is such a thing as a storm, so when it comes  suddenly very few are prepared for it. It is the same way with danger and  trouble. So Old Mr. Toad very wisely watches out when there seems to be the  least need of it, and he finds it always pays.    It was a beautiful spring evening. Over back of the Purple Hills to which  Old Mother West Wind had taken her children, the Merry Little Breezes, and  behind which jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had gone to bed, there was still a  faint, clear light. But over the Green Meadows and the Smiling Pool the  shadows had drawn a curtain of soft dusk which in the Green Forest became  black. The little stars looked down from the sky and twinkled just to see  their reflections twinkle back at them from the Smiling Pool. And there and  all around it was perfect peace. Jerry Muskrat swam back and forth, making  little silver lines on the surface of the Smiling Pool and squeaking  contentedly, for it was the hour which he loves best. Little Friend the  Song Sparrow had tucked his head under his wing and gone to sleep among the  alders along the Laughing Brook and Redwing the Blackbird had done the same  thing among the bulrushes. All the feathered songsters who had made joyous  the bright day had gone to bed.    But this did not mean that the glad spring chorus was silent. Oh, my, no!  No indeed! The Green Meadows were silent, and the Green Forest was silent,  but as if to make up for this, the sweet singers of the Smiling Pool, the  hylas and the frogs and Old Mr. Toad, were pouring out their gladness as if  they had not been singing most of the departed day. You see it was the hour  they love best of all, the hour which seems to them just made for singing,  and they were doing their best to tell Old Mother Nature how they love her,  and how glad they were that she had brought back sweet Mistress Spring to  waken them from their long sleep.    It was so peaceful and beautiful there that it didn't seem possible that  danger of any kind could be lurking near. But Old Mr. Toad, swelling out  that queer music bag in his throat and singing with all his might, never  once forgot that wise saying of his, and so he was the first to see what  looked like nothing so much as a little detached bit of the blackness of  the Green Forest floating out towards the Smiling Pool. Instantly he  stopped singing. Now that was a signal. When he stopped singing, his  nearest neighbor stopped singing, then the next one and the next, and in a  minute there wasn't a sound from the Smiling Pool save the squeak of Jerry  Muskrat hidden among the bulrushes. That great chorus stopped as abruptly  as the electric lights go out when you press a button.    Back and forth over the Smiling Pool, this way and that way, floated the  shadow, but there was no sign of any living thing in the Smiling Pool.  After awhile the shadow floated away over the Green Meadows without a  sound.    \"Hooty the Owl didn't get one of us that time,\" said Old Mr. Toad to his  nearest neighbor with a chuckle of satisfaction. Then he swelled out his  music bag and began to sing again. And at once, as abruptly as it had  stopped, the great chorus began again as joyous as before, for nothing had  happened to bring sadness as might have but for the watchfulness of Old Mr.  Toad.          VIII      OLD MR. TOAD'S BABIES      The Smiling Pool's a nursery      Where all the sunny day    A thousand funny babies      Are taught while at their play.    Really the Smiling Pool is a sort of kindergarten, one of the most  interesting kindergartens in the world. Little Joe Otter's children learn  to swim there. So do Jerry Muskrat's babies and those of Billy Mink, the  Trout and Minnow babies, and a lot more. And there you will find the  children and grandchildren of Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad.    Peter Rabbit had known for a long time about the Frog babies, but though he  knew that Old Mr. Toad was own cousin to Grandfather Frog, he hadn't known  anything about Toad babies, except that at a certain time in the year he  was forever running across tiny Toads, especially on rainy days, and each  little Toad was just like Old Mr. Toad, except for his size. Peter had  heard it said that Toads rain down from the sky, and sometimes it seems as  if this must be so. Of course he knew it couldn't be, but it puzzled him a  great deal. There wouldn't be a Toad in sight. Then it would begin to rain,  and right away there would be so many tiny Toads that it was hard work to  jump without stepping on some.    He remembered this as he went to pay his daily call on Old Mr. Toad in the  Smiling Pool and listen to his sweet song. He hadn't seen any little Toads  this year, but he remembered his experiences with them in other years, and  he meant to ask about them.    Old Mr. Toad was sitting in his usual place, but he wasn't singing. He was  staring at something in the water. When Peter said \"Good morning,\" Old Mr.  Toad didn't seem to hear him. He was too much interested in what he was  watching. Peter stared down into the water to see what was interesting Old  Mr. Toad so much, but he saw nothing but a lot of wriggling tadpoles.    \"What are you staring at so, Mr. Sobersides?\" asked Peter, speaking a  little louder than before.    Old Mr. Toad turned and looked at Peter, and there was a look of great  pride in his face. \"I'm just watching my babies. Aren't they lovely?\" said  he.    Peter stared harder than ever, but he couldn't see anything that looked  like a baby Toad.    \"Where are they?\" asked he. \"I don't see any babies but those of  Grandfather Frog, and if you ask me, I always did think tadpoles about the  homeliest things in th' world.\"    Old Mr. Toad grew indignant. \"Those are not Grandfather Frog's children;  they're mine!\" he sputtered. \"And I'll have you know that they are the most  beautiful babies in th' world!\"    Peter drew a hand across his mouth to hide a smile. \"I beg your pardon, Mr.  Toad,\" said he. \"I--I thought all tadpoles were Frog babies. They all look  alike to me.\"    \"Well, they're not,\" declared Old Mr. Toad. \"How any one can mistake my  babies for their cousins I cannot understand. Now mine are beautiful,  while--\"    \"Chug-arum!\" interrupted the great deep voice of Grandfather Frog. \"What  are you talking about? Why, your babies are no more to be compared with my  babies for real beauty than nothing at all! I'll leave it to Peter if they  are.\"    But Peter wisely held his tongue. To tell the truth, he couldn't see beauty  in any of them. To him they were all just wriggling pollywogs. They were  more interesting now, because he had found out that some of them were Toads  and some were Frogs, and he hadn't known before that baby Toads begin life  as tadpoles, but he had no intention of being drawn into the dispute now  waxing furious between Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad.          IX      THE SMILING POOL KINDERGARTEN      Play a little, learn a little, grow a little too;    That's what every pollywoggy tries his best to do.    Of course. That's what a kindergarten is for. And you may be sure that the  babies of Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad and Stickytoes the Tree Toad  did all of these things in the kindergarten of the Smiling Pool. They  looked considerably alike, did these little cousins, for they were all  pollywogs to begin with. Peter Rabbit came over every day to watch them.  Always he had thought pollywogs just homely, wriggling things, not the  least bit interesting, but since he had discovered how proud of them were  Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad, he had begun to wonder about them and  then to watch them.    \"There's one thing about them, and that is they are not in danger the way  any babies are,\" said Peter, talking to himself as is his way when there is  no one else to talk to. Just then a funny little black pollywog wriggled  into sight, and while Peter was watching him, a stout-jawed water-beetle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12648"],[0,"The Beautiful Necessity (#3)"],[1," a short interval in every human life, is yet  that for which all antecedent states seem a preparation, and of  which all subsequent ones are in some sort an effect. Greece typifies  adolescence, the love age, and so throughout the centuries humanity  has turned to the contemplation of her, just as a man all his life  long secretly cherishes the memory of his first love.    An impassioned sense of beauty and an enlightened reason characterize  the productions of Greek architecture during its best period. The  perfection then attained was possible only in a nation whereof the  citizens were themselves critics and amateurs of art, one wherein  the artist was honored and his work appreciated in all its beauty  and subtlety. The Greek architect was less bound by tradition and  precedent than was the Egyptian, and he worked unhampered by any  restrictions save such as, like the laws of harmony in music, helped  rather than hindered his genius to express itself--restrictions  founded on sound reason, the value of which had been proved by  experience.    The Doric order was employed for all large temples, since it possessed  in fullest measure the qualities of simplicity and dignity, the  attributes appropriate to greatness. Quite properly also its formulas  were more fixed than those of any other style. The Ionic order,  the feminine of which the Doric may be considered the corresponding  masculine, was employed for smaller temples; like a woman it was more  supple and adaptable than the Doric, its proportions were more slender  and graceful, its lines more flowing, and its ornament more delicate  and profuse. A freer and more elaborate style than either of these,  infinitely various, seeming to obey no law save that of beauty, was  used sometimes for small monuments and temples, such as the Tower of  the Winds, and the monument of Lysicrates at Athens.    [Illustration 1]    Because the Greek architect was at liberty to improve upon the work of  his predecessors if he could, no temple was just like any other,  and they form an ascending scale of excellence, culminating in the  Acropolis group. Every detail was considered not only with relation  to its position and function, but in regard to its intrinsic beauty as  well, so that the merest fragment, detached from the building of which  it formed a part, is found worthy of being treasured in our museums  for its own sake.    Just as every detail of a Greek temple was adjusted to its position  and expressed its office, so the building itself was made to fit  its site and to show forth its purpose, forming with the surrounding  buildings a unit of a larger whole. The Athenian Acropolis is an  illustration of this: it is an irregular fortified hill, bearing  diverse monuments in various styles, at unequal levels and at  different angles with one another, yet the whole arrangement seems as  organic and inevitable as the disposition of the features of a face.  The Acropolis is an example of the ideal architectural republic  wherein each individual contributes to the welfare of all, and at the  same time enjoys the utmost personal liberty (Illustration 1).    Very different is the spirit bodied forth in the architecture of  Imperial Rome. The iron hand of its sovereignty encased within the  silken glove of its luxury finds its prototype in buildings which were  stupendous crude brute masses of brick and concrete, hidden within a  covering of rich marbles and mosaics, wrought in beautiful but often  meaningless forms by clever degenerate Greeks. The genius of Rome  finds its most characteristic expression, not in temples to the high  gods, but rather in those vast and complicated structures--basilicas,  amphitheatres, baths--built for the amusement and purely temporal  needs of the people.    If Egypt typifies the childhood of the race and Greece its beautiful  youth, Republican Rome represents its strong manhood--a soldier filled  with the lust of war and the love of glory--and Imperial Rome its  degeneracy: that soldier become conqueror, decked out in plundered  finery and sunk in sensuality, tolerant of all who minister to his  pleasures but terrible to all who interfere with them.    The fall of Rome marked the end of the ancient Pagan world. Above  its ruin Christian civilization in the course of time arose. Gothic  architecture is an expression of the Christian spirit; in it is  manifest the reaction from licentiousness to asceticism. Man's  spiritual nature, awakening in a body worn and weakened by  debaucheries, longs ardently and tries vainly to escape. Of some such  mood a Gothic cathedral is the expression: its vaulting, marvelously  supported upon slender shafts by reason of a nicely adjusted  equilibrium of forces; its restless, upward-reaching pinnacles and  spires; its ornament, intricate and enigmatic--all these suggest the  over-strained organism of an ascetic; while its vast shadowy interior  lit by marvelously traceried and jeweled windows, which hold the eyes  in a hypnotic thrall, is like his soul: filled with world sadness,  dead to the bright brief joys of sense, seeing only heavenly visions,  knowing none but mystic raptures.    Thus it is that the history of architecture illustrates and enforces  the theosophical teaching that everything of man's creating is made in  his own image. Architecture mirrors the life of the individual and of  the race, which is the life of the individual written large in time  and space. The terrors of childhood; the keen interests and appetites  of youth; the strong stern joy of conflict which comes with manhood;  the lust, the greed, the cruelty of a materialized old age--all these  serve but as a preparation for the life of the spirit, in which the  man becomes again as a little child, going over the whole round, but  on a higher arc of the spiral.    The final, or fourth state being only in some sort a repetition of  the first, it would be reasonable to look for a certain correspondence  between Egyptian and Gothic architecture, and such a correspondence  there is, though it is more easily divined than demonstrated. In  both there is the same deeply religious spirit; both convey, in some  obscure yet potent manner, a sense of the soul being near the surface  of life. There is the same love of mystery and of symbolism; and in  both may be observed the tendency to create strange composite figures  to typify transcendental ideas, the sphinx seeming a blood-brother to  the gargoyle. The conditions under which each architecture flourished  were not dissimilar, for each was formulated and controlled by small  well-organized bodies of sincerely religious and highly enlightened  men--the priesthood in the one case, the masonic guilds in the  other--working together toward the consummation of great undertakings  amid a populace for the most part oblivious of the profound and subtle  meanings of which their work was full. In Mediaeval Europe, as in  ancient Egypt, fragments of the Ancient Wisdom--transmitted in the  symbols and secrets of the cathedral builders--determined much of  Gothic architecture.    The architecture of the Renaissance period, which succeeded the  Gothic, corresponds again, in the spirit which animates it, to Greek  architecture, which succeeded the Egyptian, for the Renaissance as  the name implies was nothing other than an attempt to revive Classical  antiquity. Scholars writing in what they conceived to be a Classical  style, sculptors modeling Pagan deities, and architects building  according to their understanding of Vitruvian methods succeeded  in producing works like, yet different from the originals they  followed--different because, animated by a spirit unknown to the  ancients, they embodied a new ideal.    In all the productions of the early Renaissance, \"that first  transcendent springtide of the modern world,\" there is the evanescent  grace and beauty of youth which was seen to have pervaded Greek art,  but it is a grace and beauty of a different sort. The Greek artist  sought to attain to a certain abstract perfection of type; to build  a temple which should combine all the excellencies of every similar  temple, to carve a figure, impersonal in the highest sense, which  should embody every beauty. The artist of the Renaissance on the other  hand delighted not so much in the type as in the variation from it.  Preoccupied with the unique mystery of the individual soul--a sense of  which was Christianity's gift to Christendom--he endeavored to portray  that wherein a particular person is unique and singular. Acutely  conscious also of his own individuality, instead of effacing it he  made his work the vehicle and expression of that individuality. The  history of Renaissance architecture, as Symonds has pointed out,  is the history of a few eminent individuals, each one moulding and  modifying the style in a manner peculiar to himself alone. In the  hands of Brunelleschi it was stern and powerful; Bramante made  it chaste, elegant and graceful; Palladio made it formal, cold,  symmetrical; while with Sansovino and Sammichele it became sumptuous  and bombastic.    As the Renaissance ripened to decay its architecture assumed more and  more the characteristics which distinguished that of Rome during the  decadence. In both there is the same lack of simplicity and sincerity,  the same profusion of debased and meaningless ornament, and there is  an increasing disposition to conceal and falsify the construction by  surface decoration.    The final part of this second or modern architectural cycle lies still  in the future. It is not unreasonable to believe that the movement  toward mysticism, of which modern theosophy is a phase and the  spiritualization of science an episode, will flower out into an  architecture which will be in some sort a reincarnation of and a  return to the Gothic spirit, employing new materials, new methods,  and developing new forms to show forth the spirit of the modern"]]]
