Towards the end of the year 1835 I was apprised that the governor of New  South Wales was desirous of having the survey of the Darling completed  with the least possible delay. His excellency proposed that I should  return for this purpose to the extreme point on the Darling where my last  journey terminated and that, after having traced the Darling into the  Murray, I should embark on the latter river and, passing the carts and  oxen to the left bank at the first convenient opportunity, proceed  upwards by water as far as practicable and regain the colony somewhere  about Yass Plains.    EQUIPMENT.    The preparations for this journey were made, as on the former occasion,  chiefly in the lumber-yard at Parramatta, and under the superintendence  of the same officer, Mr. Simpson. Much of the equipment used for the last  expedition was available for this occasion. The boats and boat-carriage  were as serviceable as ever, with the advantage of being better seasoned;  and we could now, having had so much experience, prepare with less  difficulty for such an undertaking.    In consequence of a long-continued drought serviceable horses and  bullocks were at that time scarce, and could only be obtained at high  prices; but no expense was spared by the government in providing the  animals required.    The party having preceded me by some weeks on the road, I at length  overtook it on the 15th of March in a valley near the Canobolas which I  had fixed as the place of rendezvous, and where, from the great  elevation, I hoped still to find some grass. How we were to proceed  however without water was the question I was frequently asked; and I was  informed at Bathurst that even the Lachlan was dried up.    On the following day I organised the party, and armed the men. I  distributed to each a suit of new clothing; consisting of grey trousers  and a red woollen shirt, the latter article, when crossed by white  braces, giving the men somewhat of a military appearance.    Their names and designation were as follows:    LIST OF THE MEN.    LIST OF THE PARTY PROCEEDING TO THE DARLING IN MARCH 1836.*    (*Footnote. The men whose names are printed in uppercase had obtained  their freedom as a reward for past services in the interior. The  asterisks distinguish the names of men who had been with me on one or  both the former expeditions. Those to whose names the letter T is also  prefixed having previously obtained a ticket of leave releasing them from  a state of servitude. Each man was also furnished with a small case  containing six cartridges which he was ordered always to wear about his  waist.)    COLUMN 1: NAMES.  COLUMN 2: OCCUPATION IN THE EXPLORING PARTY.

It would lead us too far into the history of the following period, to  enumerate and characterize the members of these regular societies.  It may suffice to mention, that in addition to all the guests who  frequented Madame de Tencin's, all the friends of Voltaire's school,  and at first also Rousseau, made a part of the society at the house of  Madame Geoffrin. We have already remarked that no prince, minister, or  distinguished man of all Europe came to Paris who did not visit Madame  Geoffrin, and think it an honor to be invited to her house, because he  there found united all that was exclusively called talent in Europe.    Kaunitz also, who was then only a courtier in Versailles, came  to Madame Geoffrin's parties. He was a man who combined in a most  surprising manner true philosophy and a deep knowledge of political  economy, with the outward appearance of a fop and a trifler. Among the  other distinguished men who lived in Paris, Marmontel names with high  praise the Abbe Galliani, Caraccioli, who was afterward Neapolitan  ambassador, and the Swedish ambassador, Count Creutz.    Marmontel was so much delighted with this society, even at a very  advanced age, that he gives us also accounts of their evening parties:  \"As I was in the habit of dining with the learned and with the artists  at Madame Geoffrin's, so was I also of supping with her in her more  limited and select circle. At these _petits soupers_ there was no  carousing or luxuries,--a fowl, spinach and pancakes constituted the  usual fare. The society was not numerous: there met together only five  or six of her particular friends, or even persons of the highest rank,  who were suited to each other, and therefore enjoyed themselves.\" It  appears distinctly from the passage already quoted from Marmontel,  how the high nobility on these occasions treated the learned, and  how the learned demeaned themselves toward the nobility. It appears,  therefore, that Rousseau was not in error when he alleged that  emptiness and wantonness only were cherished in these societies, and  that the literature which was then current was only a slow poison.    Madame du Deffant appeared on the stage of the great world  contemporaneously with Geoffrin, and attained so high a degree of  celebrity, that the Emperor Joseph paid her a visit in her advanced  period of life, and thus afforded her the opportunity of paying him  that celebrated compliment which is found related in every history  of France. With respect to Deffant, however, we must not listen to  Marmontel; she stood above his rhymes, his love tales, his sentimental  wanton stories, and besides, he knew her only when she had become  old. What we Germans name feminine and good morals formed no part of  the distinction of Deffant, but talents only. Like Tencin, she was  ill-reputed in her youth on account of her amours, and reckoned the  Regent among her fortunate wooers; at a later period she turned her  attention to literature.    Deffant brought together at her house all those persons whom Voltaire  visited when he was in Paris; among these the President Henault,  and, at a later period of which we now speak, D'Alembert attracted  to this circle distinguished foreigners and Frenchmen, who made  any pretensions to culture and education. Deffant assumed quite a  different tone among the learned from that of Geoffrin. She set up  for a judge in questions of philosophy and taste, and carried on a  constant correspondence with Voltaire. Among celebrated foreigners,  the Englishman Horace Walpole played the same character in this house  which the Swede Creutz had assumed in that of Geoffrin. Deffant and  her Walpole became celebrated throughout Europe by their printed  correspondence, which, on account of its smoothness and emptiness,  like all books written for the great world, found very numerous  readers.    Deffant, moreover, like Geoffrin. was faithless to her friends; she  wished indeed to enjoy the most perfect freedom in their society, but  she was unwilling that they should publish abroad this freedom. And  she strongly disapproved of the vehemence with which her friends  assailed the existing order of things.    When she afterward lost a considerable part of her property, and  became blind, she occupied a small dwelling in an ecclesiastical  foundation in Paris, but continued to receive philosophers, poets  and artists in her house; and in order to give a little more life to  the conversation, she invited a young lady whose circumstances were  straitened to be her companion. This was Mademoiselle l'Espinasse.  L'Espinasse was not beautiful, but she was young, amiable, lively, and  more susceptible than we in Germany are accustomed either to allow or  to pardon. Deffant, on the other hand, was witty and intelligent, but  old, bitter, and withal egotistically insensible. The boldest scoffers  assembled around L'Espinasse, and there was afterward formed around  her a circle of her own. Deffant turned day into night, and night into  day. She and the Duchess of Luxembourg, who was inseparable from her,  received learned distinguished personages and foreigners, from six  o'clock in the evening during the greater part of the night.    The importance in which such ladies and such societies were held, not  merely in France but in all Europe, may be judged of from the fact,  that the breach between Deffant and her young companion was treated  in some measure as a public European event. The French minister and  foreign ambassadors took part in it, and the whole literary world felt  its effect. After this breach there were two tone-giving tribunals for  the guidance of public opinion in matters of literature and taste,  and their decisions were circulated by letter over all Europe. Horace  Walpole, Henault, Montesquieu. Voltaire, whose correspondence with  Deffant has been published in the present century, remained true to  her cause. D'Alembert, whose correspondence with Deffant, as well as  that of the Duchess of Maine, have also been published in our century,  went over to L'Espinasse. This academician, whose name and influence  was next in importance to that of Voltaire, formed the nucleus of a  new society in the house of L'Espinasse, and was grievously tormented  by his _inamorata_, who pursued one plan of conquest after another  when she saw one scheme of marriage after another fail of success. It  appears from the whole of the transactions and consequences connected  with this breach, however surprising it may be, that this formation  of a new circle in Paris for evening entertainment may be with truth  compared to the institution of a new academy for the promotion of  European culture and refinement. The Duchess of Luxembourg, who  continued to be a firm friend of Deffant, took upon herself to provide  suitable apartments for the society, whilst the minister of the day  (the Duc de Choiseul) prevailed upon the king to grant a pension of no  inconsiderable amount to L'Espinasse.    This new circle was the point of union for all the philosophical  reformers. Here D'Alembert and Diderot led the conversation; and the  renowned head of the political economists, Tuergot, who was afterward  minister of state, was a member of this bolder circle of men who  became celebrated and ill-renowned under the name of Encyclopaedists.  We shall enter upon a fuller consideration of the tone and taste which  reigned in this assembly, as well as in the society which met in  the house of Holbach, and of the history of the Encyclopaedia, in the  following period, and shall only now mention at the conclusion of the  present, and that very slightly, some of the other clever societies  of Parisians who were all in their day celebrated in Europe. It is  scarcely possible for us to judge of the charm which these societies  possessed in the great world. This may be best learned from their  own writings and conversation, a specimen of which may be found  in Marmontel's 'Memoirs,' and formed the subject of a conversation  between him and the Duke of Brunswick (who fell at Jena in 1806) and  his duchess.    The society of _beaux esprits_ which met at the house of Madame de  Popliniere, in the time of Madame de Tencin, was only short-lived,  like the good fortune of the lady herself. In her house there  assembled members of the great world who were addicted to carousing  and debauchery, and learned men who sought to obtain their favor  and approbation. The same sort of society was afterward kept up in  the house of Holbach. A smaller society, which frequented the house  of the farmer-general Pelletier, consisted of unmarried people,  who were known as persons who indulged in malicious and licentious  conversation. Colle, the younger Crebillon and Bernard, who,  notwithstanding his helplessness, was called _le gentil_, played the  chief characters in this reunion, and the Gascon nature of Marmontel,  which was always forward and intrusive, helped him into this society  also. Baron Holbach, who was a native of the Palatinate, and the  able Helvetius who was wanton merely from vanity, brought together  expressly and intentionally at a later period, around their  well-spread table, all those who declared open war against religion  and morality. We must, however, return to these men in the following  period.    Holbach for a whole quarter of a century had regular dinner-parties  on Sundays, which are celebrated in the history of atheism. All those  were invited, who were too bold and too out-spoken for Geoffrin; and  even D'Alembert also at a later period withdrew from their society.    Grimm, whose copious correspondence has also been published in the  nineteenth century, gives minutes and notices of all the memorable  sayings and doings that served to entertain and occupy the  polite world in Europe. Grimm also entertained and feasted these  distinguished gentlemen. He was not at that time consul for Gotha, or  employed and"]]]
