Surtr sits on the border  to guard the land; at the end of the world he will fare forth, and harry  and overcome all the gods and burn the world with fire. Ere the races  were yet mingled, or the folk of men grew, Yawning-gap, which looked  towards the north parts, was filled with thick and heavy ice and  rime, and everywhere within were fog and gusts; but the south side  of Yawning-gap lightened by the sparks and gledes that flew out of  Muspell-heim; as cold arose out of Niflheim and all things grim, so was  that part that looked towards Muspell hot and bright; but Yawning-gap  was as light as windless air, and when the blast of heat met the rime,  so that it melted and dropped and quickened; from those life-drops  there was shaped the likeness of a man, and he was named Ymir; he was  bad, and all his kind; and so it is said, when he slept he fell into a  sweat; then waxed under his left hand a man and a woman, and one of his  feet got a son with the other, and thence cometh the Hrimthursar. The  next thing when the rime dropped was that the cow hight Audhumla was  made of it; but four milk-rivers ran out of her teats, and she fed Ymir;  she licked rime-stones that were salt, and the first day there came at  even, out of the stones, a man's hair, the second day a man's head, the  third day all the man was there. He is named Turi; he was fair of  face, great and mighty; he gat a son named Bor, who took to him Besla,  daughter of Bolthorn, the giant, and they had three sons, Odin, Vili,  and Ve. Bor's sons slew Ymir the giant, but when he fell there ran so  much blood out of his wounds that all the kin of the Hrimthursar were  drowned, save Hvergelmir and his household, who got away in a boat. Then  Bor's sons took Ymir and bore him into the midst of Yawning-gap, and  made of him the earth; of his blood seas and waters, of his flesh earth  was made; they set the earth fast, and laid the sea round about it in  a ring without; of his bones were made rocks; stones and pebbles of his  teeth and jaws and the bones that were broken; they took his skull and  made the lift thereof, and set it up over the earth with four sides, and  under each corner they set dwarfs, and they took his brain and cast it  aloft, and made clouds. They took the sparks and gledes that went loose,  and had been cast out of Muspellheim, and set them in the lift to give  light; they gave resting-places to all fires, and set some in the lift;  some fared free under it, and they gave them a place and shaped their  goings. A wondrous great smithying, and deftly done. The earth is  fashioned round without, and there beyond, round about it lies the deep  sea; and on that sea-strand the gods gave land for an abode to the giant  kind, but within on the earth made they a burg round the world against  restless giants, and for this burg reared they the brows of Ymir, and  called the burg Midgard. The gods went along the sea-strand and found  two stocks, and shaped out of them men; the first gave soul and life,  the second wit and will to move, the third face, hearing, speech, and  eyesight. They gave them clothing and names; the man Ask and the woman  Embla; thence was mankind begotten, to whom an abode was given under  Midgard. Then next Bor's sons made them a burg in the midst of the  world, that is called Asgard; there abode the gods and their kind, and  wrought thence many tidings and feats, both on earth and in the Sky.  Odin, who is hight Allfather, for that he is the father of all men and  sat there in his high seat, seeing over the whole world and each man's  doings, and knew all things that he saw. His wife was called Frigg, and  their offspring is the Asa-stock, who dwell in Asgard and the realms  about it, and all that stock are known to be gods. The daughter and wife  of Odin was Earth, and of her he got Thor, him followed strength and  sturdiness, thereby quells he all things quick; the strongest of all  gods and men, he has also three things of great price, the hammer  Miolnir, the best of strength belts, and when he girds that about him  waxes his god strength one-half, and his iron gloves that he may not  miss for holding his hammer's haft. Balidr is Odin's second son, and  of him it is good to say, he is fair and: bright in face, and hair, and  body, and him all praise; he is wise and fair-spoken and mild, and that  nature is in him none may withstand his doom. Tyr is daring and best of  mood; there is a saw that he is tyrstrong who is before other men and  never yields; he is also so wise that it is said he is tyrlearned who  is wise. Bragi is famous for wisdom, and best in tongue-wit, and cunning  speech, and song-craft. 'And many other are there, good and great; and  one, Loki, fair of face, ill in temper and fickle of mood, is called the  backbiter of the Asa, and speaker of evil redes and shame of all gods  and men; he has above all that craft called sleight, and cheats all  in all things. Among the children of Loki are Fenris-wolf and  Midgards-worm; the second lies about all the world in the deep sea,  holding his tail in his teeth, though some say Thor has slain him; but  Fenris-wolf is bound until the doom of the gods, when gods and men shall  come to an end, and earth and heaven be burnt, when he shall slay Odin.  After this the earth shoots up from the sea, and it is green and fair,  and the fields bear unsown, and gods and men shall be alive again, and  sit in fair halls, and talk of old tales and the tidings that  happened aforetime. The head-seat, or holiest-stead, of the gods is at  Yggdrasil's ash, which is of all trees best and biggest; its boughs are  spread over the whole world and stand above heaven; one root of the ash  is in heaven, and under the root is the right holy spring; there hold  the gods doom every day; the second root is with the Hrimthursar,  where before was Yawning-gap; under that root is Mimir's spring, where  knowledge and wit lie hidden; thither came Allfather and begged a drink,  but got it not before he left his eye in pledge; the third root is  over Niflheim, and the worm Nidhogg gnaws the root beneath. A fair hall  stands under the ash by the spring, and out of it come three maidens,  Norns, named Has-been, Being, Will-be, who shape the lives of men; there  are beside other Norns, who come to every man that is born to shape his  life, and some of these are good and some evil. In the boughs of the  ash sits an eagle, wise in much, and between his eyes sits the hawk  Vedrfalnir; the squirrel Ratatoskr runs up and down along the ash,  bearing words of hate betwixt the eagle and the worm. Those Norns who  abide by the holy spring draw from it every day water, and take the clay  that lies around the well, and sprinkle them up over the ash for that  its boughs should not wither or rot. All those men that have fallen in  the fight, and borne wounds and toil unto death, from the beginning of  the world, are come to Odin in Valhall; a very great throng is there,  and many more shall yet come; the flesh of the boar Soerfmnir is sodden  for them every day, and he is whole again at even; and the mead they  drink that flows from the teats of the she-goat Heidhrun. The meat Odin  has on his board he gives to his two wolves, Geri and Freki, and he  needs no meat, wine is to him both meat and drink; ravens twain sit on  his shoulders, and say into his ear all tidings that they see and hear;  they are called Huginn and Muninn (mind and memory); them sends he at  dawn to fly over the whole world, and they come back at breakfast-tide,  thereby becomes he wise in many tidings, and for this men call him  Raven's-god. Every day, when they have clothed them, the heroes put on  their arms and go out into the yard and fight and fell each other; that  is their play, and when it looks toward mealtime, then ride they home to  Valhall and sit down to drink. For murderers and men forsworn is a great  hall, and a bad, and the doors look northward; it is altogether wrought  of adder-backs like a wattled house, but the worms' heads turn into the  house, and blow venom, so that rivers of venom run along the hall, and  in those rivers must such men wade forever.\" There was no priest-class;  every chief was priest for his own folk, offered sacrifice, performed  ceremonies, and so on.    In politics the homestead, with its franklin-owner, was the unit; the  \"thing\", or hundred-moot, the primal organisation, and the \"godord\",  or chieftainship, its tie. The chief who had led a band of kinsmen and  followers to the new country, taken possession of land, and shared it  among them, became their head-ruler and priest at home, speaker and  president of their Thing, and their representative in any dealings with  neighbouring chiefs and their clients. He was not a feudal lord, for  any franklin could change his \"godord\" as he liked, and the right  of \"judgment by peers\" was in full use. At first there was no higher  organisation than the local thing. A central thing, and a speaker to  speak a single \"law\" for the whole island, was instituted in 929, and  afterwards the island was divided in four quarters, each with a court,  under the Al-thing. Society was divided only into two classes of men,  the free and unfree, though political power was in the hands of the  franklins alone; \"godi\" and thrall ate the same food, spoke the same  tongue, wore much the same clothes, and were nearly alike in life and  habits. Among the free men there was equality in all but wealth and the  social standing that cannot be separated therefrom. The thrall was a  serf rather than a slave, and could own a house, etc., of his own. In a  generation or so the freeman or landless retainer, if he got a homestead  of his own, was the peer of the highest in the land.

A wealthy Canadian  newspaper mogul named Conrad Black financed a new daily  in Toronto called The National Post. Black told readers  that his paper would advance an alternative point of  view, a far right conservative position on politics in  Canada. As owner of London's Daily Telegraph, the  Jerusalem Post, and Chicago's Sun-Times, Mr. Black  hired top talent and spared no expense, at least for  the first two years, to make the Post successful in  creating and wooing the conservative voice in Canada.  In the 2000 election, his paper became as one-sided as  Navhind Times was in 1963. The paper supported a new  party called Canadian Alliance, a highly conservative  group drawn mostly from western Canada, and was  hell-bent to destroy Prime Minister Jean Chretien and  the Liberals. Alas, the people didn't buy it! And the  Liberals forged ahead with a third majority win.    During this time, Mr. Black's personal agenda of  wanting to be a peer in the House of Lords in England  came out front and centre. The British Prime Minister  Tony Blair recommended and the Queen accepted that  Conrad Black be made a Lord. But sweet revenge raised  its arms and Jean Chretien said Black couldn't be a  Lord while being a Canadian citizen. Black was forced  to renounce his Canadian citizenship. Not only that,  but Black sold the National Post in 2001 for a tidy  profit. He is now Lord Black of Crossharbour in the  House of Lords.    I started this article with the observation that facts  are sacred and comment is free. Both elements of  journalism, it seems to me, are flawed. Like beauty and  sex, freedom of the press is in the eye of the beholder  and in the loins of the performer. It's all relative,  never absolute.      Chapter 2:  Goan journalism: Views from near and far    Eugene CorreiaCanada-based Eugene Correia has worked for a wide range  of national-level newspapers published in India.  Besides those listed below, he has also written for  India Today, and a number of expat Indian publications  published from overseas. What stands out is this  journalist's sharp understanding of Goan issues and  politics, and his memory for detail, all the more  remarkable since he has been based outside Goa for  virtually his entire working life.    I must admit I have no direct connection with  journalism in Goa, in the sense of having worked in the  state. However, I was involved in Goan journalism in  Mumbai (then Bombay), but that too in a limited way. I  wrote few pieces for the Konkani-language papers such  as The Goa Times and Ave Maria and the English-Konkani  weekly, The Goan Sports Weekly. After Goa's Liberation,  and till I left India for Canada in late 1981, I took  more than a cursory look at how journalism is practiced  in Goa. I read The Navhind Times often, as the paper  was available in Mumbai during the 1970s.    I was involved in mainstream journalism in Mumbai since  my college days, first with The Indian Express and  later with the Free Press Journal. I provided freelance  services for both papers in the sports department. It  was my dad's cousin, Felix Valois Rodrigues, who  inspired me to take up journalism. A versatile writer  in English, Konkani and Portuguese, he worked for the  Indian Express in New Delhi till his retirement.     Getting into the field    Felix Uncle, as I called him, introduced me to the news  editor of Indian Express in Mumbai and I was given a  chance to work in the sports department under CSA Swami  . The news editor, S Krishnamoorty, popularly known as  SKM, who regarded by many as more powerful then the  editor because of his close relationship with Ramnath Goenka,  The Indian Express proprietor.    As a freedom fighter who served in jail for his  anti-Portuguese activities, Rodrigues was  well-connected in Goa. After my graduation, he gave me  an introductory letter to Lamberto Mascarenhas, who was  by then no longer the joint editor of The Navhind Times,  Goa's first English-language daily.    Mascarenhas, in turn, gave me an introductory note to  K.S.K. Menon, who had been co-editor with Mascarenhas,  and later promoted to editor. I took the letter to  Menon and, after reading it, said he would contact me  if any position arose.    He gave me back the note. I read the Mascarenhas'  scribbled note and was shocked. Mascarenhas had  introduced me as a \"chap\" from \"my village\". It was  true, we both came from Colva, but to a young man like  me seeking a job it was horrifying to read a learned  man like Mascarenhas call me a chap.    It's also true that Mascarenhas and I belong to  different strata in Goa's caste system. I couldn't  believe a man of his stature could introduce me in such  a demeaning way. I think I have the note somewhere in  my collection of memorabilia.    I never got a job at The Navhind Times. In later years,  I met Mascarenhas in the office of Goa Today. From his  days at The Navhind Times to owning Goa Today,  Mascarenhas had become an icon in Goan journalism. He  had also gained reputation as a novelist for his  acclaimed book, Sorrowing Lies My Land. In subsequent  years, I learnt a lot about Mascarenhas as a man and  his role as a freedom fighter in the liberation  struggle in Mumbai. One of his best friends, Professor  Edward Mendonca taught me at St. Xavier's College.  Mendonca and I came to know each other well after me  finishing my graduation. Twice I saw him very drunk and  I had to hail a taxi for him and drop him near his  house in Colaba.    Mendonca reputation for booze is legendary as his  mastery over the English language and his ability to  teach. He and me spoke at times of Mascarenhas's  reputed novel. Mendonca's hand can be been throughout  the book, and many English scholars have also been  curious about it. Because of his alcoholism, it became  easy for many to dismiss Mendonca's influence in  Mascarenhas's book as a boast from a drunkard. Those  like me who knew Mendonca reasonably well have reason  to believe that Mendonca could be anything but a liar.    I held no grudge against Mascarenhas for calling me a  \"chap\", but deep inside me I carried the wound. Even in  Goa I would go to see him. On one such visit, I asked  him if he would provide me with an opportunity to write  for his magazine. He dismissed me summarily saying he  prefers reputed writers. I thought he would encourage a  young journalist like me. I resolved never to write for  the magazine and I have never written for it.    When I learnt the magazine was taken over by the Salgaocars,  I felt happy. Happy not because the magazine no  longer belonged to Mascarenhas, but happy because I  felt the new owners and the new editor would give  opportunities to new writers. As we now know, it has  happened. Goa Today was no longer the domain of one man  and his ego.    On another visit during summer, I was dressed in a  suit. I was to meet the then Chief Minister Dayanand Bandodkar   and later attend a wedding in the city. Since I had no  personal means of transport, for me to travel from  Bogmallo to Panaji and back twice would be difficult,  so I had worn the suit and left home early morning. As  soon as I told Mascarenhas that I was going to meet  Bandodkar, Mascarenhas's face changed colour. He  admonished me for wearing a suit to see the chief  minister, saying that journalists must be dressed  informally. I explained to Mascarenhas, but I could see  that Mascarenhas bore some hatred for the late  Bhausaheb, as the chief minister was affectionately known.    That very same day, I met some journalists, including  Michael Fernandes who, I believe, was The Indian Express   correspondent in Goa. I told them that Mascarenhas  seemed piqued at me for wearing a suit. If I remember  correctly, Fernandes said that Mascarenhas has a  personal bias against Bandodkar regarding the  withdrawal of government advertisement. He told me that  Mascarenhas and Bandodkar were once on a friendly  basis, but both had fallen apart.    I think my second adventure in getting a job in Goa  came when Erasmo de Sequeira launched his paper, Goa Monitor  . I applied for a position but never got appointed. The  paper lived for a brief time.    Some years later, my uncle told me that he has an offer  from the Chowgules to start a Konkani daily. I came to  Goa for a visit and went to see Rodrigues at his  residence in Darbandora. He and I designed the logo for Uzvadd,  though it may have been refined when the paper was  launched. Rodrigues never took up the position as he  was to be under the editorial supervision of Madhav Gadkari,  the then editor of Gomantak. Gadkari was fiercely pro-Marathi   and my uncle felt his efforts to promote Konkani journalism   would be subverted by Gadkari. To my surprise, Evagrio Jorge,  the noted freedom fighter and news reader at  All-India Radio in Panaji, was its first editor. The  paper was well received. As expected, Jorge and the  owners or probably Gadkari had a difference of opinion.  In a short time, Jorge was out and he launched his own  paper, Novem Uzvadd.     Throwing light on Uzvadd    Without the financial muscles of the Chowgules that  sustained Uzvadd, Jorge's paper suffered. I think it  was also during this time that a group started another Konkani   daily, Novem Goem. I am not sure why Uzvadd eventually  folded up.    My friend, Cyril D'Cunha, started a sports weekly  called Goal, and I was its Mumbai correspondent. I  contributed many stories till the paper went under for  reasons unknown to me. This was my direction connection  to Goa's journalism. Later on, I was offered a job at  the West Coast Times, a daily launched by the House of  Timblos. At least two senior colleagues of mine at the  Free Press Journal went to Goa to start the paper. One  of them was Y.M. Hegde and the other, P.R. Menon.    Before going to Goa and even after the paper began  publishing from Margao in South Goa, Hegde said it  would be good for me to come to Goa. I"]]]
