DIAGRAMS.          THE EVOLUTION OF MODESTY.    I.    The Definition of Modesty--The Significance of Modesty--Difficulties in  the Way of Its Analysis--The Varying Phenomena of Modesty Among Different  Peoples and in Different Ages.      Modesty, which may be provisionally defined as an almost instinctive fear  prompting to concealment and usually centering around the sexual  processes, while common to both sexes is more peculiarly feminine, so that  it may almost be regarded as the chief secondary sexual character of women  on the psychical side. The woman who is lacking in this kind of fear is  lacking, also, in sexual attractiveness to the normal and average man. The  apparent exceptions seem to prove the rule, for it will generally be found  that the women who are, not immodest (for immodesty is more closely  related to modesty than mere negative absence of the sense of modesty),  but without that fear which implies the presence of a complex emotional  feminine organization to defend, only make a strong sexual appeal to men  who are themselves lacking in the complementary masculine qualities. As a  psychical secondary sexual character of the first rank, it is necessary,  before any psychology of sex can be arranged in order, to obtain a clear  view of modesty.        The immense importance of feminine modesty in creating masculine      passion must be fairly obvious. I may, however, quote the      observations of two writers who have shown evidence of insight      and knowledge regarding this matter.        Casanova describes how, when at Berne, he went to the baths, and      was, according to custom, attended by a young girl, whom he      selected from a group of bath attendants. She undressed him,      proceeded to undress herself, and then entered the bath with him,      and rubbed him thoroughly all over, the operation being performed      in the most serious manner and without a word being spoken. When      all was over, however, he perceived that the girl had expected      him to make advances, and he proceeds to describe and discuss his      own feelings of indifference under such circumstances. \"Though      without gazing on the girl's figure, I had seen enough to      recognize that she had all that a man can desire to find in a      woman: a beautiful face, lively and well-formed eyes, a beautiful      mouth, with good teeth, a healthy complexion, well-developed      breasts, and everything in harmony. It is true that I had felt      that her hands could have been smoother, but I could only      attribute this to hard work; moreover, my Swiss girl was only      eighteen, and yet I remained entirely cold. What was the cause of      this? That was the question that I asked myself.\"        \"It is clear,\" wrote Stendhal, \"that three parts of modesty are      taught. This is, perhaps, the only law born of civilization which      produces nothing but happiness. It has been observed that birds      of prey hide themselves to drink, because, being obliged to      plunge their heads in the water, they are at that moment      defenceless. After having considered what passes at Otaheite, I      can see no other natural foundation for modesty. Love is the      miracle of civilization. Among savage and very barbarous races we      find nothing but physical love of a gross character. It is      modesty that gives to love the aid of imagination, and in so      doing imparts life to it. Modesty is very early taught to little      girls by their mothers, and with extreme jealousy, one might say,      by _esprit de corps_. They are watching in advance over the      happiness of the future lover. To a timid and tender woman there      ought to be no greater torture than to allow herself in the      presence of a man something which she thinks she ought to blush      at. I am convinced that a proud woman would prefer a thousand      deaths. A slight liberty taken on the tender side by the man she      loves gives a woman a moment of keen pleasure, but if he has the      air of blaming her for it, or only of not enjoying it with      transport, an awful doubt must be left in her mind. For a woman      above the vulgar level there is, then, everything to gain by very      reserved manners. The play is not equal. She hazards against a      slight pleasure, or against the advantage of appearing a little      amiable, the danger of biting remorse, and a feeling of shame      which must render even the lover less dear. An evening passed      gaily and thoughtlessly, without thinking of what comes after, is      dearly paid at this price. The sight of a lover with whom one      fears that one has had this kind of wrong must become odious for      several days. Can one be surprised at the force of a habit, the      slightest infractions of which are punished with such atrocious      shame? As to the utility of modesty, it is the mother of love. As      to the mechanism of the feeling, nothing is simpler. The mind is      absorbed in feeling shame instead of being occupied with desire.      Desires are forbidden, and desires lead to actions. It is evident      that every tender and proud woman--and these two things, being      cause and effect, naturally go together--must contract habits of      coldness which the people whom she disconcerts call prudery. The      power of modesty is so great that a tender woman betrays herself      with her lover rather by deeds than by words. The evil of      modesty is that it constantly leads to falsehood.\" (Stendhal, _De      l'Amour_, Chapter XXIV.)        It thus happens that, as Adler remarks (_Die Mangelhafte      Geschlechtsempfindung des Weibes_, p. 133), the sexual impulse in      women is fettered by an inhibition which has to be conquered. A      thin veil of reticence, shyness, and anxiety is constantly cast      anew over a woman's love, and her wooer, in every act of      courtship, has the enjoyment of conquering afresh an oft-won      woman.        An interesting testimony to the part played by modesty in      effecting the union of the sexes is furnished by the fact--to      which attention has often been called--that the special modesty      of women usually tends to diminish, though not to disappear, with      the complete gratification of the sexual impulses. This may be      noted among savage as well as among civilized women. The      comparatively evanescent character of modesty has led to the      argument (Venturi, _Degenerazioni Psico-sessuali_, pp. 92-93)      that modesty (_pudore_) is possessed by women alone, men      exhibiting, instead, a sense of decency which remains at about      the same level of persistency throughout life. Viazzi (\"Pudore      nell 'uomo e nella donna,\" _Rivista Mensile di Psichiatria      Forense_, 1898), on the contrary, following Sergi, argues that      men are, throughout, more modest than women; but the points he      brings forward, though often just, scarcely justify his      conclusion. While the young virgin, however, is more modest and      shy than the young man of the same age, the experienced married      woman is usually less so than her husband, and in a woman who is      a mother the shy reticences of virginal modesty would be rightly      felt to be ridiculous. (\"Les petites pudeurs n'existent pas pour      les meres,\" remarks Goncourt, _Journal des Goncourt_, vol. iii,      p. 5.) She has put off a sexual livery that has no longer any      important part to play in life, and would, indeed, be      inconvenient and harmful, just as a bird loses its sexual plumage      when the pairing season is over.        Madame Celine Renooz, in an elaborate study of the psychological      sexual differences between men and women (_Psychologie Comparee      de l'Homme et de la Femme_, 1898, pp. 85-87), also believes that      modesty is not really a feminine characteristic. \"Modesty,\" she      argues, \"is masculine shame attributed to women for two reasons:      first, because man believes that woman is subject to the same      laws as himself; secondly, because the course of human evolution      has reversed the psychology of the sexes, attributing to women      the psychological results of masculine sexuality. This is the      origin of the conventional lies which by a sort of social      suggestion have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13611"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 2 (#3)"],[1,"of the  opposite sex at once restored them to normal conditions.[3] Bombarda of  Lisbon states that in Portugal it is well known that in every herd of  bulls there is nearly always one bull who is ready to lend himself to the  perverted whims of his companions.[4] It may easily be observed how a cow  in heat exerts an exciting influence on other cows, impelling them to  attempt to play the bull's part. Lacassagne has also noted among young  fowls and puppies, etc., that, before ever having had relations with the  opposite sex, and while in complete liberty, they make hesitating attempts  at intercourse with their own sex.[5] This, indeed, together with similar  perversions, may often be observed, especially in puppies, who afterward  become perfectly normal. Among white rats, which are very sexual animals,  Steinach found that, when deprived of females, the males practise  homosexuality, though only with males with whom they have long associated;  the weaker rats play the passive part. But when a female is introduced  they immediately turn to her; although they are occasionally altogether  indifferent to sex, they never actually prefer their own sex.[6]    With regard to the playing of the female part by the weaker rats it is  interesting to observe that Fere found among insects that the passive part  in homosexual relations is favored by fatigue; among cockchafers it was  the male just separated from the female who would take the passive part  (on the rare occasions when homosexual relations occurred) with a fresh  male.[7]    Homosexuality appears to be specially common among birds. It was among  birds that it attracted the attention of the ancients, and numerous  interesting observations have been made in more recent times. Thus Selous,  a careful bird-watcher, finds that the ruff, the male of the _Machetes  pugnax_, suffers from sexual repression owing to the coyness of the female  (the reeve), and consequently the males often resort to homosexual  intercourse. It is still more remarkable that the reeves also, even in the  presence of the males, will court each other and have intercourse.[8] We  may associate this with the high erotic development of birds, the  difficulty with which tumescence seems to occur in them, and their long  courtships.    Among the higher animals, again, female monkeys, even when grown up (as  Moll was informed), behave in a sexual way to each other, though it is  difficult to say how far this is merely in play. Dr. Seitz, Director of  the Frankfurt Zooelogical Garden, gave Moll a record of his own careful  observations of homosexual phenomena among the males and females of  various animals confined in the Garden (_Antelope cervicapra, Bos Indicus,  Capra hircus, Ovis steatopyga_).[9] In all such cases we are not concerned  with sexual inversion, but merely with the accidental turning of the  sexual instinct into an abnormal channel, the instinct being called out  by an approximate substitute, or even by diffused emotional excitement, in  the absence of the normal object.    It is probable, however, that cases of true sexual inversion--in which  gratification is preferably sought in the same sex--may be found among  animals, although observations have rarely been made or recorded. It has  been found by Muccioli, an Italian authority on pigeons, that among  Belgian carrier-pigeons inverted practices may occur, even in the presence  of many of the other sex.[10] This seems to be true inversion, though we  are not told whether these birds were also attracted toward the opposite  sex. The birds of this family appear to be specially liable to sexual  perversion. Thus M.J. Bailly-Maitre, a breeder of great knowledge and a  keen observer, wrote to Girard that \"they are strange creatures in their  manners and customs and are apt to elude the most persistent observer. No  animal is more depraved. Mating between males, and still more frequently  between females, often occurs at an early age: up to the second year. I  have had several pairs of pigeons formed by subjects of the same sex who  for many months behaved as if the mating were natural. In some cases this  had taken place among young birds of the same nest, who acted like real  mates, though both subjects were males. In order to mate them productively  we have had to separate them and shut each of them up for some days with a  female.\"[11] In the Berlin Zooelogical Gardens also, it has been noticed  that two birds of the same sex will occasionally become attached to each  other and remain so in spite of repeated advances from individuals of  opposite sex. This occurred, for instance, in the case of two males of the  Egyptian goose who were thus to all appearance paired, and always kept  together, vigorously driving away any female that approached. Similarly a  male Australian sheldrake was paired to a male of another species.[12]    Among birds generally, inverted sexuality seems to accompany the  development of the secondary sexual characters of the opposite sex which  is sometimes found. Thus, a poultry-breeder describes a hen (colored  Dorking) crowing like a cock, only somewhat more harshly, as a cockerel  crows, and with an enormous comb, larger than is ever seen in the male.  This bird used to try to tread her fellow-hens. At the same time she laid  early and regularly, and produced \"grand chickens.\"[13] Among ducks, also,  it has occasionally been observed that the female assumes at the same time  both male livery and male sexual tendencies. It is probable that such  observations will be multiplied in the future, and that sexual inversion  in the true sense will be found commoner among animals than at present it  appears to be.    Traces of homosexual practices, sometimes on a large scale, have been  found among all the great divisions of the human race. It would be  possible to collect a considerable body of evidence under this head.[14]  Unfortunately, however, the travellers and others on whose records we are  dependent have been so shy of touching these subjects, and so ignorant of  the main points for investigation, that it is very difficult to discover  sexual inversion in the proper sense in any lower race. Travellers have  spoken vaguely of crimes against nature without defining the precise  relationship involved nor inquiring how far any congenital impulse could  be distinguished.    Looking at the phenomena generally, so far as they have been recorded  among various lower races, we seem bound to recognize that there is a  widespread natural instinct impelling men toward homosexual relationships,  and that this has been sometimes, though very exceptionally, seized upon  and developed for advantageous social purposes. On the whole, however,  unnatural intercourse (sodomy) has been regarded as an antisocial offense,  and punishable sometimes by the most serious penalties that could be  invented. This was, for instance, the case in ancient Mexico, in Peru,  among the Persians, in China, and among the Hebrews and Mohammedans.    Even in very early history it is possible to find traces of homosexuality,  with or without an implied disapproval. Its existence in Assyria and  Babylonia is indicated by the Codex Hamurabi and by inscriptions which do  not on the whole refer to it favorably.[15] As regards Egypt we learn from  a Fayum papyrus, found by Flinders Petrie, translated by Griffiths, and  discussed by Oefele,[16] that more than four thousand years ago homosexual  practices were so ancient that they were attributed to the gods Horus and  Set. The Egyptians showed great admiration of masculine beauty, and it  would seem that they never regarded homosexuality as punishable or even  reprehensible. It is notable, also, that Egyptian women were sometimes of  very virile type, and Hirschfeld considers that intermediate sexual types  were specially widespread among the Egyptians.[17]    One might be tempted to expect that homosexual practices would be  encouraged whenever it was necessary to keep down the population.  Aristotle says that it was allowed by law in Crete for this end. And  Professor Haddon tells me that at Torres Straits a native advocated sodomy  on this ground.[18] There seems, however, on the whole, to be little  evidence pointing to this utilization of the practice. The homosexual  tendency appears to have flourished chiefly among warriors and warlike  peoples. During war and the separation from women that war involves, the  homosexual instinct tends to develop; it flourished, for instance, among  the Carthaginians and among the Normans, as well as among the warlike  Dorians, Scythians, Tartars, and Celts,[19] and, when there has been an  absence of any strong moral feeling against it, the instinct has been  cultivated and, idealized as a military virtue, partly because it  counteracts the longing for the softening feminine influences of the home  and partly because it seems to have an inspiring influence in promoting  heroism and heightening _esprit de corps_. In the lament of David over  Jonathan we have a picture of intimate friendship--\"passing the love of  women\"--between comrades in arms among a barbarous, warlike race. There is  nothing to show that such a relationship was sexual, but among warriors in  New Caledonia friendships that were undoubtedly homosexual were recognized  and regulated; the fraternity of arms, according to Foley,[20] complicated  with pederasty, was more sacred than uterine fraternity. We have,  moreover, a recent example of the same relationships recognized in a  modern European race--the Albanians.        Hahn, in the course of his _Albanische Studien_ (1854, p. 166),      says that the young men between 16 and 24 lore boys from about 12      to 17. A Gege marries at the age of 24 or 25, and then he      usually, but not always, gives up boy-love. The following passage      is reported by Hahn as the actual language used to him by an      Albanian Gege: \"The lover's feeling "]]]
