G., Speaker  of the House of Representatives of Federated Australia, contributed the  following article to the N. Y. Independent, of June 9, 1904. Lady Holder  has taken a leading part in philanthropic work in South Australia. She  says:    \"The women of South Australia were placed in a position of political  equality with men several years ago. Accordingly, everybody has become  accustomed to the arrangement, and it seems perfectly natural. It has  not produced any marked effect on female character, or made any  particular difference to domestic life. Women are more interested in  public affairs than they used to be, and politicians deal more earnestly  with home and social questions, but no neglect of private duties on that  account can be laid to the women's charge. We are well supplied with  high-class newspapers, the same sources of information are open to women  as to men, and the questions that arise are not by any means beyond the  scope of their intelligence. At election meetings there is commonly a  good sprinkling of women voters in the audiences. It is said that their  presence tends to prevent disorderliness, and I have never heard of a  lady at any meeting being rudely treated.    \"Voting, with us, is one of the simplest things in the world. When an  elector's mind is made up, there is less difficulty in expressing it  through the ballot-box than in matching a ribbon, and the one act is not  considered more unfeminine than the other. Our freedom has not developed  a class of political women, we have no \"shrieking sisterhood,\" but we  know and use our power. We can do a great deal toward securing members  of good character in the Parliament and influencing their votes, and are  generally content with the results of our enfranchisement.    \"I have described the conditions in my own State thus fully because,  though it is one of the smaller States in the Australian Commonwealth,  in this matter it is further advanced than most of the others. When  federation came, adult suffrage was the law only in South Australia and  Western Australia; it has since been adopted in New South Wales and  Tasmania, but it has not yet been granted, so far as the State  Legislatures are concerned, in the other two. The Federal Parliament,  however, had to make its own electoral laws, and to establish uniformity  was obliged to adopt the broadest existing basis, because the  constitution forbade the outrage and anomaly of disfranchising persons  by whom some of its members had been elected. Accordingly, the women of  New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Tasmania were somewhat  suddenly placed in the same position of political equality, so far as  the Commonwealth is concerned, as their South Australian and West  Australian sisters. They were legally qualified to act in the Federal  elections of last December, and as they had not been allowed a similar  privilege at elections for their legislatures, of course the event  produced considerable sensation and wore an air of strangeness and  novelty. The newspapers gave special attention to the new voters, and  teemed with exhortations as to the way they should go, and it was  amusing to observe how some candidates who had fought against woman's  suffrage with all their might tried to show their supreme regard and  esteem for the voters whose rights they had previously refused. By the  time polling day arrived, the average woman was probably as well  prepared to discharge her electoral duty as the average man.    \"Three women offered themselves as candidates, Mrs. Martell and Mrs.  Moore, in New South Wales, and Miss Vida Goldstein in Victoria. The  candidature of the two former was not unanimously approved by the  Women's Association of their own State, and their defeat was a foregone  conclusion; but Miss Goldstein was indorsed by the Victorian  organization to which she belonged, and, though unsuccessful, the fact  that she received 51,497 votes proved that she had many sympathizers.  She did not ally herself with either of the great political parties. Her  object was avowedly to show that home interests ought to be represented  in Parliament and by women, as well as manufacturing, mining, farming,  and other interests, by persons who were engaged in them. Next to the  votes she received, the most significant thing was the considerate and  respectful treatment she met throughout. It showed that the political  woman who respects herself may trust for protection to the chivalry of  men.\"    Australian experience has conclusively disposed of the objection that  women have no aptitude for politics or interest in public affairs. They  have proved that they possess both, and while they have no general  ambition or desire for parliamentary honors, and display no sex  antagonism, they regard their right to vote for representatives as a  responsible trust. It is rendered equally clear that they can and do  exercise a salutary influence on the political life of the country  without sustaining in the slightest degree any of the injuries or  disabilities that have been supposed to follow. They are as good wives,  mothers, and sisters as ever, and better companions for their men folk  because of their widened interest and the truer equality in which they  stand.           *       *       *       *       *    Subscribe For    PROGRESS    Official Organ N.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg  Literary Archive Foundation    Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide  spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be  freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest  array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt  status with the IRS.    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United  States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up  with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND  DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular  state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who  approach us with offers to donate.    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from  outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.    Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation  methods and addresses.
