It is said to-day that Sir Bampfylde Fuller  recommended certain measures about education, and that the Government  have now adopted them. But the circumstances are completely changed.  What was thought by Lord Minto and his Council to be a rash and  inexpedient course in those days, is not thought so now that the  circumstances have changed. I will only mention one point. There was  a statement the other day in a very important newspaper that the  condition of anti-British feeling in Eastern Bengal had gained in  virulence since Sir Bampfylde Fuller's resignation. This, the Viceroy  assures me, is an absolute perversion of the facts. The whole  atmosphere has changed for the better. When I say that Lord Minto was  justified in the course he took, I say it without any prejudice to  Sir Bampfylde Fuller, or the slightest wish to injure his future  prospects.    Now I come to the subject of the disorders. I am extremely sorry to  say that some disorder has broken out in the Punjab. I think I may  assume that the House is aware of the general circumstances from  Answers to Questions. Under the Regulation of 1818 (which is still  alive), coercive measures were adopted. Here I would like to examine,  so far as I can, the action taken to preserve the public interests. It  would be quite wrong, in dealing with the unrest in the Punjab, not to  mention the circumstances that provided the fuel for the agitation.  There were ravages by the plague, and these ravages have been cruel.  The seasons have not been favourable. A third cause was an Act then on  the stocks, which was believed to be injurious to the condition of a  large body of men. Those conditions affecting the Colonisation Act  were greatly misrepresented. An Indian member of the Punjab Council  pointed out how impolitic he thought it was; and, as I told the House  about a week ago, the Viceroy, declining to be frightened by the  foolish charge of pandering to agitation and so forth, refused assent  to that proposal. But in the meantime the proposal of the colonisation  law had become a weapon in the hands of the preachers of sedition. I  suspect that the Member for East Nottingham will presently get up and  say that this mischief connected with the Colonisation Act accounted  for the disturbance. But I call attention to this fact, in order that  the House may understand whether or not the Colonisation Act was the  main cause of the disturbance. The authorities believe that it was  not. There were twenty-eight meetings known to have been held by the  leading agitators in the Punjab between 1st March, and 1st May. Of  these five only related, even ostensibly, to agricultural grievances;  the remaining twenty-three were all purely political. The figures seem  to dispose of the contention that agrarian questions are at the root  of the present unrest in the Punjab. On the contrary, it rather  looks as if there was a deliberate heating of the public atmosphere  preparatory to the agrarian meeting at Rawalpindi on the 21st April,  which gave rise to the troubles. The Lieutenant-Governor visited  twenty-seven out of twenty-nine districts. He said the situation  was serious, and it was growing worse. In this agitation special  attention, it is stated, has been paid to the Sikhs, who, as the House  is aware, are among the best soldiers in India, and in the case of  Lyallpur, to the military pensioners. Special efforts have been made  to secure their attendance at meetings to enlist their sympathies  and to inflame their passions. So far the active agitation has been  virtually confined to the districts in which the Sikh element is  predominant. Printed invitations and leaflets have been principally  addressed to villages held by Sikhs; and at a public meeting at  Ferozepore, at which disaffection was openly preached, the men of the  Sikh regiments stationed there were specially invited to attend, and  several hundreds of them acted upon the invitation. The Sikhs were  told that it was by their aid, and owing to their willingness to  shoot down their fellow countrymen in the Mutiny, that the Englishmen  retained their hold upon India. And then a particularly odious line of  appeal was adopted. It was asked, \"How is it that the plague attacks  the Indians and not the Europeans?\" \"The Government,\" said these men,  \"have mysterious means of spreading the plague; the Government spreads  the plague by poisoning the streams and wells.\" In some villages the  inhabitants have actually ceased to use the wells. I was informed only  the other day by an officer, who was in the Punjab at that moment,  that when visiting the settlements, he found the villagers disturbed  in mind on this point. He said to his men: \"Open up your kits, and let  them see whether these horrible pills are in them.\" The men did as  they were ordered, but the suspicion was so great that people insisted  upon the glasses of the telescopes being unscrewed, in order to be  quite sure that there was no pill behind them.    See the emergency and the risk. Suppose a single native regiment had  sided with the rioters. It would have been absurd for us, knowing we  had got a weapon there at our hands by law--not an exceptional law,  but a standing law--and in the face of the risk of a conflagration,  not to use that weapon; and I for one have no apology whatever to  offer for using it. Nobody appreciates more intensely than I do the  danger, the mischief, and a thousand times in history the iniquity of  what is called \"reason of State.\" I know all about that. It is full of  mischief and full of danger; but so is sedition, and we should have  incurred criminal responsibility if we had opposed the resort to this  law.    I do not wish to detain the House with the story of events in Eastern  Bengal and Assam. They are of a different character from those in the  Punjab, and in consequence of these disturbances the Government of  India, with my approval, have issued an Ordinance, which I am sure the  House is familiar with, under the authority and in the terms of an Act  of Parliament. The course of events in Eastern Bengal appears to have  been mainly this--first, attempts to impose the boycott on Mahomedans  by force; secondly, complaints by Hindus if the local officials stop  them, and by Mahomedans if they do not try to stop them; thirdly,  retaliation by Mahomedans; fourthly, complaints by Hindus that the  local officials do not protect them from this retaliation; fifthly,  general lawlessness of the lower classes on both sides, encouraged by  the spectacle of the fighting among the higher classes; sixthly, more  complaints against the officials. The result of the Ordinance has been  that down to May 29th it had not been necessary to take action in any  one of these districts.    I noticed an ironical look on the part of the right hon. Gentleman  when I referred with perfect freedom to my assent to the resort to the  weapon we had in the law against sedition. I have had communications  from friends of mine that, in this assent, I am outraging the  principles of a lifetime. I should be ashamed if I detained the House  more than two minutes on anything so small as the consistency of my  political life. That can very well take care of itself. I began by  saying that this is the first time that British democracy in its full  strength, as represented in this House, is face to face with the  enormous difficulties of Indian Government. Some of my hon. friends  look even more in sorrow than in anger upon this alleged backsliding  of mine. Last year I told the House that India for a long time to  come, so far as my imagination could reach, would be the theatre  of absolute and personal government, and that raised some doubts.  Reference has been made to my having resisted the Irish Crimes Act, as  if there were a scandalous inconsistency between opposing the policy  of that Act, and imposing this policy on the natives of India. That  inconsistency can only be established by anyone who takes up the  position that Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, is exactly on the  same footing as these 300,000,000 people--composite, heterogeneous,  with different histories, of different races, different faiths. Does  anybody contend that any political principle whatever is capable  of application in every sort of circumstances without reference to  conditions--in every place, and at every time? I, at all events, have  never taken that view, and I would like to remind my hon. friends that  in such ideas as I have about political principles, the leader of my  generation was Mr. Mill. Mill was a great and benignant lamp of wisdom  and humanity, and it was at that lamp I and others kindled our modest  rushlights. What did Mill say about the government of India? Remember  he was not merely that abject and despicable being, a philosopher. He  was a man practised in government, and in what government? Why, he was  responsible, experienced, and intimately concerned in the government  of India. What did he say? If there is anybody who can be quoted as  having been a champion of representative government it is Mill; and in  his book, which, I take it, is still the classic book on that subject,  this is what he says--        \"Government by the dominant country is as legitimate as any other,      if it is the one which, in the existing state of civilization of      the subject people, most facilitates their transition to a higher      state of civilization.\"    Then he says this--        \"The ruling country ought to be able to do for its subjects      all that could be done by a succession of absolute monarchs,      guaranteed by irresistible force against the precariousness of      tenure attendant on barbarous despotisms, and qualified by their      genius to anticipate all that experience"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#3)"],[1,"avement--Propagation of the system of education, in the  neighborhood of London, and ultimately in most of the principal  places in England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland--Misapprehension  and perversion of the principles of infant education--Signs of  advancement--Hope for the future_.           *       *       *       *       *      Be it a weakness, it deserves some praise,    We love the play-place of our early days;    The scene is touching.\"--_Cowper_      \"What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under    the sun?\"--_Ecclesiastes i. 3_.           *       *       *       *       *      How came you to think of the Infant School system of teaching?--is  a question that I have often been asked; and my friends think it  advisable that it should, in part at least, be answered. I proceed  therefore, in compliance with their wishes, to give some little of  the required information in this place, as perhaps it may throw light  upon, or explain more clearly, the fundamental principles laid down  and advocated throughout this volume. In few words, then, I would  reply,--_circumstances_ forced me to it. Born an only child, under  peculiar circumstances, and living in an isolated neighbourhood, I had  no childish companions from infancy; I was, consequently, thrown much  on my own resources, and early became a _thinker_, and in some measure  a contriver too. I beheld a beautiful world around me, full of  everything to admire and to win attention. As soon as I could think at  all, I saw that there must be a Maker, Governor, and Protector of this  world. Such things as had life won my admiration, and thus I became  very fond of animals. Flowers and fruits, stones and minerals, I also  soon learned to observe and to mark their differences. This led to  enquiries as to how they came--where from--who made them? My mother  told me they came from God, that he made them and all things that I  saw; and also that he made herself and me. From that moment I never  doubted His wonderful existence. I could not, nor did I have, at that  age, any correct idea of God; but I soon learned to have elevated  notions of His works, and through them I was led to adore something  invisible--something I was convinced of within, but could not see. My  mother, to my knowledge, never deceived me, or told me an untruth:  therefore, I believed her implicitly; and to this day I never doubted.  So much for the implanting an early _faith_ in the Unseen. But the  beautiful world and the things in it which I saw, and with which I  came in contact, Oh! how wonderful they appeared to me! They were my  companions! Other children were strange to me, and they were not nigh  either to help or to thwart me.    My mother was my oracle during the first six years of childhood,  resolving my difficulties and answering my questions. I was  happy--very happy! and still look back to those days with  indescribable pleasure and satisfaction. I had no tasks. I was not  pestered with _A.B. C_., nor _ab. eb. ib_. From _things_ my parents  chiefly taught me my first lessons, and they have been as durable as  life. For days and weeks did I study such lessons. My parents waited  till I asked for information, and when it was required it was never  denied. The world and the wonders in it formed as it were a heaven to  me. I am told I gave but little trouble at this age. In the beautiful  fields and wild coppices about Hornsey, as yet unencroached upon by  suburban extension; and by the side of the then solitary banks of the  New River, I was always to be found. In cold and wet weather I had  a stock of similar lessons in my home. Small live animals were my  constant companions; they taught me that love begets love. I did love  and delight in them, and when they died I mourned their loss. Every  day brought me new information, which my parents perfected. At length  the alphabet was mastered, and afterwards spelling, reading, and  so forth. My mind _being thus previously filled with ideas_, the  acquirement of words and abstract terms became less irksome, and I  cannot remember that thus far it cost me any trouble, much less pain.  Information of every kind fit for childhood then really gave me  pleasure. No doubt I am greatly indebted to my parents for their  judicious management. My father always in the evening, took great  pains to explain things to me; he nurtured but never crammed; he knew  when to teach and when to let alone. Unfortunately, through very  peculiar circumstances, I was removed from the immediate care and  superintendence of both parents rather early in life; and, at an age  the most dangerous, was left to grapple nearly alone with the wide  world and the beings in it, with little of either parental guidance.  It was then I saw the immense importance and advantage of early  impressions. To me they were of incalculable benefit, and no doubt  led, when I became a man, to the thoughts which ended in the  development and practical working of the Infant System and method of  education.    Schools for infants then existed, but what were they? Simply  dame-schools, with the hornbook for boys and girls, and perhaps a  little sewing for the latter. Their sign was--\"Children taught to read  and work here,\" and their furniture the cap and bells, the rod in  pickle, and a corner for dunces. The finishing stroke was seen in the  parlour of the inn, or the farm-house, in the shape of needlework as a  samplar;--\"Lydia Languish, her work, done at ---- school, in the year  of our Lord, 1809.\" Such were the schools in country places then in  existence, the little ones doing nothing. In after-life, I thought  a remedy was required and might be found, and therefore set about  working it out. How it was done shall be hereafter explained.    I knew my own infant state had been a happy one, and I wondered to see  children crying to go to school, when learning had been such a delight  to me. But I soon ceased to wonder when I was sent there myself. At my  first school I can truly say I learnt nothing, except it be that I had  especially the sense of feeling. I often had raps with the cane on the  head, across the shoulders, and on the hand, and I found it was mainly  for not learning what the teacher had _forgotten to teach me_. The  terms used were \"master\" and \"mistress,\" and they were tolerably  appropriate as far as I was concerned, for to me both became objects  of terror, so much so, that for the first time in my life, I really  fretted when the hour of teaching came. My parents were not long in  perceiving this although I did not complain. They told me it was for  my good that I should go to school, and I thoroughly believed them.  Yet I could not understand why it should be associated with so much  dislike and pain on my part, when my first school,--the beautiful  world of nature, had been so lovely, and my first teachers had always  increased the delight by removing my difficulties, and this so much  so that I now longed for evening to come to have fresh light and  instruction given. My father now decided that I should not go to  school, and he became my teacher as before, the world being my great  book. I was delighted with Robinson Crusoe, and this work became my  companion, and to which was added the Pilgrim's Progress. After these,  my great favourite was Buffon's Natural History. I used to go alone,  taking a volume at a time, to read amidst the pleasant country around,  but most frequently in the quiet nooks and retreats of Hornsey Wood.  It seems, however, that I was always watched and superintended by my  mother during these readings and rural rambles, for whenever danger  was near she generally appeared, but seldom otherwise, so that I had  perfect freedom in these matters. I have every reason to believe that  the first seven years of my life laid the basis of all I know that is  worth knowing, and led to the formation of my character and future  career in life. Of my schooling afterwards it is unnecessary to say  much, as it was the usual routine such as others had, but it never  satisfied me, and I even then saw errors throughout the whole, and  this strengthened my first impressions, and tended to mature the  after-thought in me, that something wanted doing and _must be done_.  It is not my intention in this introductory chapter to write an  auto-biography; but my object is simply to show, how one impression  followed another in my case, and what led to it; to point out briefly  the various plans and inventions I had recourse to in carrying out my  views and intentions; and, finally, to allude to their propagation  through the country personally by myself, on purpose to show, in  conclusion, that although infant education has been extensively  adopted, and many of its principles, being based on nature, have been  applied with great success to older children, yet especially in the  case of infants, that strict adherence to nature and simplicity which  is so fundamental and so requisite, has been often overlooked, and in  some cases totally discarded.    It will, I trust, appear from what has been already said, that even  from early childhood I both saw and felt that there was a period in  human life, and that the most important period, as experience has  proved to my full satisfaction, not legislated for, that is, not duly  provided with suitable and appropriate methods of education. To see  this was one thing, to provide a remedy for it and to _invent plans_  for carrying out that remedy, was another. The systems of Bell and of  Lancaster were then commencing operations, but were quite unsuitable  for children under seven years of age at least, and therefore took  little or no cognizance of that early period, which I had been  inwardly convinced was of such eminent importance. I was destined for  business, and served the usual apprenticeship to become qualified for  it, and also continued in it for a short period on my own account.  Even at"]]]
