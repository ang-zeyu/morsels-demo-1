[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#3)"],[1,"    \"And think if he'd ever lay a hold on one of us like that!\" said  Harry. He went to the stump and examined the side of one of the roots.  It was stained with crimson.    \"Look where his finger tips worked through the dirt and the bark,  right down to the solid wood,\" murmured Joe.    They looked at each other uneasily. \"My gosh,\" said Joe, \"think of the  way I handled him the other night! He--he let me trip him up and throw  him!\" He shuddered. \"Why, if he'd laid hold of me just once, he'd of  squashed my muscles like they was rotten fruit!\"    Of one accord they turned back to the house. At the door they paused  and peered in, as into the den of a bear. There sat Bull on the  floor--he risked his weight to none of the crazy chairs--still looking  at his stained hands. Then they drew back and again looked at each  other with scared eyes and spoke in undertones.    \"After this maybe he won't want to follow orders. Maybe he'll get sort  of free and easy and independent.\"    \"If he does, you watch Dad give him his marching orders. Dad won't  have no one lifting heads agin' him.\"    \"Neither will I,\" snapped Joe. \"I guess we own this house. I guess we  support that big hulk. I'm going to try him right quick.\"    He went back to the door of the shack. \"Bull, they ain't any wood for  the stove tonight. Go chop some quick.\"    The floor squeaked and groaned under Bull's weight as he rose, and  again the brothers looked to each other.    \"All right,\" came cheerily from Bull Hunter.    He came through the door with his ax and went to the log pile. The  brothers watched him throw aside the top logs and get at the heavier  trunks underneath. He tore one of these out, laid it in place, and the  sun flashed on the swift circle of the ax. Joe and Harry stepped back  as though the light had blinded them.    \"He didn't never work like that before,\" declared Joe.    The ax was buried almost to the haft in the tough wood, and the steel  was wrenching out with a squeak of the metal against the resisting  wood. Again the blinding circle and the indescribable sound of the  ax's impact, slicing through the wood. A great chip snapped up high  over the shoulder of the chopper and dropped solidly to the ground at  the feet of the brothers. Again they exchanged glances and drew a  little closer together. The log divided under the shower of eating  blows, and Bull attacked the next section.    Presently he came to a pause, leaning on the handle of the ax and  staring into the distance. At this the brothers sighed with relief.    \"I guess he ain't changed so much,\" said Harry. \"But it was queer, eh?  Kind of like a bear waking up after he'd been sleeping all winter!\"    They jarred Bull out of his dream with a shout and set him to work  again; then they started the preparations for the evening meal. The  simple preparations were soon completed, but after the potatoes were  boiled, they delayed frying the bacon, for their father, old Bill  Campbell, had not yet returned from his hunting trip and he disliked  long-cooked food. Things had to be freshly served to suit Bill, and  his sons dared the wrath of heaven rather than the biting reproaches  of the old man.    It was strange that Bill delayed his coming so long. As a rule he was  always back before the coming of evening. An old and practiced  mountaineer, he had never been known to lose sense of direction or  sense of distance, and he was an hour overdue when the sun went down  and the soft, beautiful mountain twilight began.    There were other reasons which would ordinarily have disturbed Bill  and brought him home even ahead of time. Snow had fallen heavily above  the timberline a few days before, and now the keen whistling of the  wind and the swift curtaining of clouds, which was drawing across the  sky, threatened a new storm that might even reach down to the shack.    And yet no Bill appeared.    The brothers waited in the shack, and the darkness was increasing. Any  one of a number of things might have happened to their father, but  they were not worried. For one thing, they wasted no love on the stern  old man. They knew well enough that he had plenty of money, but he  kept them here to a dog's life in the shack, and they hated him for  it. Besides, they had a keen grievance which obscured any worry about  Bill--they were hungry, wildly hungry. The darkness set in, and the  feeble light wandered from the smoked chimney of the lantern and made  the window black.    Outside, the wind began to scream, sighing in the distance among the  firs, and then pouncing upon the cabin and shaking it as though in  rage. The fire would smoke in the stove at every one of these blasts,  and the flame leaped in the lantern.    Bull Hunter had to lean closer to the light and frown to make out the  print of his book. The sight of his stolid immobility merely sharpened  their hunger, for there was never any passion in this hulk of a man.  When he relaxed over a book the world went out like a snuffed candle  for him. He read slowly, lingering over every page, for now and again  his eyes drifted away from the print, and he dreamed over what he had  read. In reality he was not reading for the plot, but for the pictures  he found, and he dreaded coming to the end of a book also, for books  were rare in his life. A scrap of a magazine was a treasure. A full  volume was a nameless delight.    And so he worked slowly through every paragraph and made it his and  dreamed over it until he knew every thought and every picture by  heart. Once slowly devoured in this way, it was useless to reread a  book. It was far better to simply sit and let the slow memory of it  trail through his mind link by link, just as he had first read it and  with all the embroiderings which his own fancy had conjured up.    Often this stupid pondering over a book would madden the two brothers.  It irritated them till they would move the lantern away from him. But  he always followed the light with a sigh and uncomplainingly settled  down again. Sometimes they even snatched the book out of his hands. In  that case he sat looking down at his empty fingers, dreaming over his  own thoughts as contentedly as though the living page were in his  vision. There was small satisfaction in tormenting him in these ways.    Tonight they dared not bother him. The stained hands were still in  their minds, and the tremendous, joyous laughter as he whirled the  stump over his head still rang in their ears. But they watched him  with a sullen envy of his immobility. Just as a man without an  overcoat envies the woolly coat of a dog on a windy December day.    Only one sound roused the reader. It was a sudden loud snorting from  the shed behind the house and a dull trampling that came to him  through the noise of the rising wind. It brought Bull lurching to his  feet, and the stove jingled as his weight struck the yielding center  boards of the floor. Out into the blackness he strode. The wind shut  around him at once and plastered his clothes against his body as if he  had been drenched to the skin in water. Then he closed the door.    \"What brung him to life?\" asked Harry.    \"Nothin', He just heard ol' Maggie snort. Always bothers him when  Maggie gets scared of something--the old fool!\"    Maggie was an ancient, broken-down draft horse. Strange vicissitudes  had brought her up into the mountains via the logging camp. She was  kept, not because there was any real hauling to be done for Bill  Campbell, but because, having got her for nothing, she reminded him of  the bargain she had been. And Bull, apparently understanding the  sluggish nature of the old mare by sympathy of kind, use to work her  to the single plow among the rocks of their clearing. Here, every  autumn, they planted seed that never grew to mature grain. But that  was Bill Campbell's idea of making a home.    Presently Bull came back and settled with a slump into his old place.    \"Going to snow?\" asked Harry.    \"Yep.\"    \"Feel it in the wind?\"    It was an old joke among them, for Bull often declared with ridiculous  solemnity that he could foretell snow by the change in the air.    \"Yep,\" answered Bull, \"I felt the wind.\"    He looked up at them, abashed, but they were too hungry to waste  breath with laughter. They merely sneered at him as he settled back  into his book. And, just as his head bowed, a far shouting swept down  at them as the wind veered to a new point.    \"Uncle Bill!\" said Bull and rose again to open the door.    The others wedged in behind his bulk and stared into the blackness.          CHAPTER 3      They stood with the wind taking them with its teeth and pressing them  heavily back. They could hear the fire flare and flutter in the stove;  then the wind screamed again, and the wail came down to them.    \"Uncle Bill!\" repeated Bull and, lowering his head, strode into the  storm.    The others exchanged frightened glances and then followed, but not  outside of the shaft of light from the door. In the first place it was  probably not their father. Who could imagine Bill shouting for help?  Such a thing had never been dreamed of by his worst enemies, and they  knew that their father's were legion. Besides it was cold, and this  was a wild-goose chase which meant a chilled hide and no gain.    But, presently, through the darkness they made out the form of a  horseman and the great bulk of Bull coming back beside him. Then they  ran out into the night.    They recognized the hatless, squat figure of their father at once,  even in the dark, with the wind twitching his beard sideways. When  they called to him he did not speak. Then they saw that Bull was  leading the horse.    Plainly something was wrong, and presently they discovered that Bill  Campbell was actually tied upon his horse. He gave no orders, and they  cut the ropes in silence. Still he did not dismount.    \"Bull,\" he commanded, \"lift me off the hoss!\"    The giant plucked him out of the saddle and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10338"],[0,"With the Turks in Palestine (#3)"],[1,"  generally treated kindly. We knew most of the drill-exercises from the  gymnastic training we had practiced since childhood, and the officers  realized that we were educated and came from respectable families. The  same was also true with regard to the native Christians, most of whom  can read and write and are of a better class than the Mohammedans of the  country. When Turkey threw in her lot with the Germanic powers, the  attitude toward the Jews and Christians changed radically; but of this I  shall speak later.    It was a hard life we led while in training at Saffed; evening would  find us dead tired, and little disposed for anything but rest. As the  tremendous light-play of the Eastern sunsets faded away, we would gather  in little groups in the courtyard of our mosque--its minaret towering  black against a turquoise sky--and talk fitfully of the little  happenings of the day, while the Arabs murmured gutturally around us.  Occasionally, one of them would burst into a quavering, hot-blooded  tribal love-song. It happened that I was fairly well known among these  natives through my horse Kochba--of pure Maneghi-Sbeli blood--which I  had purchased from some Anazzi Bedouins who were encamped not far from  Aleppo: a swift and intelligent animal he was, winner of many races, and  in a land where a horse is considerably more valuable than a wife, his  ownership cast quite a glamour over me.    [ILLUSTRATION: THE AUTHOR ON HIS HORSE KOCHBA]    In the evenings, then, the Arabs would come up to chat. As they speak  seldom of their children, of their women-folk never, the conversation  was limited to generalities about the crops and the weather, or to the  recitation of never-ending tales of Abou-Zeid, the famous hero of the  Beni-Hilal, or of Antar the glorious. Politics, of which they have  amazing ideas, also came in for discussion. Napoleon Bonaparte and Queen  Victoria are still living figures to them; but (significantly enough)  they considered the Kaiser king of all the kings of this world, with the  exception of the Sultan, whom they admitted to equality.    Seldom did an evening pass without a dance. As darkness fell, the Arabs  would gather in a great circle around one of their comrades, who  squatted on the ground with a bamboo flute; to a weird minor music they  would begin swaying and moving about while some self-chosen poet among  them would sing impromptu verses to the flute _obbligato_. As a rule the  themes were homely.    \"To-morrow we shall eat rice and meat,\" the singer would wail.    \"_Yaha lili-amali\"_ (my endeavor be granted), came the full-throated  response of all the others. The chorus was tremendously effective.  Sometimes the singer would indulge in pointed personalities, with  answering roars of laughter.    These dances lasted for hours, and as they progressed the men gradually  worked themselves up into a frenzy. I never failed to wonder at these  people, who, without the aid of alcohol, could reproduce the various  stages of intoxication. As I lay by and watched the moon riding serenely  above these frantic men and their twisting black shadows, I reflected  that they were just in the condition when one word from a holy man would  suffice to send them off to wholesale murder and rapine.    It was my good fortune soon to be released from the noise and dirt of  the mosque. I had had experience with corruptible Turkish officers; and  one day, when barrack conditions became unendurable, I went to the  officer commanding our division--an old Arab from Latakieh who had been  called from retirement at the time of the mobilization. He lived in a  little tent near the mosque, where I found him squatting on the floor,  nodding drowsily over his comfortable paunch. As he was an officer of  the old regime, I entered boldly, squatted beside him and told him my  troubles. The answer came with an enormous shrug of the shoulders.    \"You are serving the Sultan. Hardship should be sweet!\"    \"I should be more fit to serve him if I got more sleep and rest.\"    He waved a fat hand about the tent.    \"Look at me! Here I am, an officer of rank and\"--shooting a knowing  look at me--\"I have not even a nice blanket.\"    \"A crime! A crime!\" I interrupted. \"To think of it, when I, a humble  soldier, have dozens of them at home! I should be honored if you would  allow me--\" My voice trailed off suggestively.    \"How could you get one?\" he asked.    \"Oh, I have friends here in Saffed but I _must_ be able to sleep in a  nice place.\"    \"Of course; certainly. What would you suggest?\"    \"That hotel kept by the Jewish widow might do,\" I replied.    More amenities were exchanged, the upshot of which was that my four  friends and I were given permission to sleep at the inn--a humble place,  but infinitely better than the mosque. It was all perfectly simple.    [ILLUSTRATION: SOLDIERS' TENTS IN SAMARIA]          CHAPTER III    THE GERMAN PROPAGANDA      So passed the days of our training, swiftly, monotonously, until the  fateful December morning when the news came like a thunderbolt that  Turkey was about to join hands with Germany. We had had reports of the  war--of a kind. Copies of telegrams from Constantinople, printed in  Arabic, were circulated among us, giving accounts of endless German  victories. These, however, we had laughed at as fabrications of a  Prussophile press agency, and in our skepticism we had failed to give  the Teutons credit for the successes they had actually won. To us, born  and bred in the East as we were, the success of German propaganda in the  Turkish Empire could not come as an overwhelming surprise; but its  fullness amazed us.    It may be of timely interest to say a few words here regarding this  propaganda as I have seen it in Palestine, spreading under strong and  efficient organization for twenty years.    In order to realize her imperialistic dreams, Germany absolutely needed  Palestine. It was the key to the whole Oriental situation. No mere  coincidence brought the Kaiser to Damascus in November, 1898,--the same  month that Kitchener, in London, was hailed as Gordon's avenger,--when  he uttered his famous phrase at the tomb of Saladin: \"Tell the three  hundred million Moslems of the world that I am their friend!\" We have  all seen photographs of the imperial figure, draped in an amazing  burnous of his own designing (above which the Prussian _Pickelhaube_  rises supreme), as he moved from point to point in this portentous  visit: we may also have seen Caran d'Ache's celebrated cartoon (a  subject of diplomatic correspondence) representing this same imperial  figure, in its Oriental toggery, riding into Jerusalem on an ass.    The nations of Europe laughed at this visit and its transparent purpose,  but it was all part of the scheme which won for the Germans the  concessions for the Konia-Bagdad Railway, and made them owners of the  double valley of the Euphrates and Tigris. Through branch lines  projected through the firman, they are practically in control of both  the Syrian routes toward the Cypriotic Mediterranean and the Lebanon  valleys. They also control the three Armenian routes of Cappadocia, the  Black Sea, and the trans-Caucasian branch of Urfa, Marach, and Mardine.  (The fall of Erzerum has altered conditions respecting this last.) They  dominate the Persian routes toward Tauris and Teheran as well; and last,  but not least, the Gulf branch of Zobeir. These railways delivered into  German hands the control of Persia, whence the road to India may be made  easy: through Syria lies the route to the Suez Canal and Egypt, which  was used in February, 1915, and will probably be used again this year.    To make this Oriental dream a reality, the Germans have not relied on  their railway concessions alone. Their Government has done everything in  its power to encourage German colonization in Palestine. Scattered all  over the country are German mills that half of the time have nothing to  grind. German hotels have been opened in places seldom frequented by  tourists. German engineers appeared in force, surveying, sounding,  noting. All these colonists held gatherings in the Arab villages, when  the ignorant natives were told of the greatness of Germany, of her good  intentions, and of the evil machinations of other powers. What I state  here can be corroborated by any one who knows Palestine and has lived in  it.    About the time when we first knew that Turkey would join the Germanic  powers came the news that the \"Capitulations\" had been revoked. As is  generally known, foreigners formerly enjoyed the protection of their  respective consuls. The Turkish Government, under the terms of the  so-called Capitulations, or agreements, had no jurisdiction over an  American, for instance, or a Frenchman, who could not be arrested  without the consent of his consul. In the Ottoman Empire, where law and  justice are not at a premium, such protection was a wholesome and  necessary policy.    The revoking of the Capitulations was a terrible blow to all the  Europeans, meaning, as it did, the practical abolition of all their  rights. Upon the Arabs it acted like an intoxicant. Every boot-black or  boatman felt that he was the equal of the accursed Frank, who now had no  consul to protect him; and abuses began immediately. Moreover, as if by  magic, the whole country became Germanized. In all the mosques, Friday  prayers were ended with an invocation for the welfare of the Sultan and  \"Hadji Wilhelm.\" The significance of this lies in the fact that the  title \"Hadji\" can be properly applied only to a Moslem who has made the  pilgrimage to Mecca and kissed the sacred stone of the Kaaba. Instant  death is the penalty paid by any Christian who is found within that  enclosure: yet Wilhelm II, head of the Lutheran faith, stepped forward  as \"Hadji Wilhelm.\" His pictures were sold everywhere; German officers  appeared; and it seemed as if a wind of brutal mastery were blowing.
