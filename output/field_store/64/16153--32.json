This manoeuvre was  long; we should have come to the wind, as soon as they cried, \"a man  overboard,\" it is true that somebody cried aloud from the poop, that he was  saved; and a sailor had indeed caught him by the arm, but he had been  obliged to let him go, because he would have been pulled overboard himself:  a boat was however let down; it was a six-oared barge in which there were  only three men: it was all in vain; and after having looked for some time,  the boat came on board again without having found even the buoy. If the  unfortunate youth, who seemed to swim pretty well, had strength to reach  it, he doubtless perished on it, after having experienced the most cruel  sufferings. The ship was trimmed, and we resumed our course.    The _Echo_ rejoined us, and for some time she kept within hail; but we soon  lost her. On the 26th, we plied to windward during the night, fearing lest  we should strike on the eight rocks, which are situated the most  _Northerly_, in 34 deg. 45', Latitude, and the most _Southerly_ in latitude,  34 deg. 30', so that the extent of this danger is about five leagues from  _North_ to _South_ and about four leagues from _East_ to _West_: the most  southerly rock is distant about forty leagues to the _North_, 5 deg. East, from  the East point of Madeira.    On the 27th, in the morning we expected to see the island of Madeira, we  however proceeded to no purpose till noon, at which hour we made an  observation to ascertain our situation. The solar observation made us East,  and West of Porto Santo; we continued on the same tack, and in the evening  at sunset, the man at the mast head discovered, land.[10] This error in the  arrival, was at least thirty leagues in the East. It was attributed to the  currents of the straits of Gibraltar; if this error really arises from the  currents of the strait, it merits the attention of vessels which frequent  these seas. The whole night we proceeded with few sails up; at midnight we  tacked, in order not to approach too near to the land.[A1]    The next morning at day break we saw very distinctly the islands of Madeira  Porto Santo; on the larboard, were those called Desert; Madeira was at  least twelve leagues off: sailing before the wind we made nine knots, and  in a few hours we were very near it. For a considerable time we ran along  the coast of the island at a small distance from shore: we passed before  the principal towns, Funchal and Do Sob.[A2]    Madeira appears like an amphitheatre; the country houses which cover it  seem to be in a very good taste, and give it a charming appearance. All  these delightful habitations are surrounded by fine gardens, and fields  covered with orange and lemon trees, which when the wind blows from the  shore, diffuse for full half a league in the open sea, the most agreeable  perfume. The hills are covered with vineyards, bordered with banian trees:  in short every thing is combined to render Madeira one of the most  beautiful islands of Africa. Its soil is only a vegetable sand, mixed with  an ash, which gives it astonishing fertility; it shews every where nothing  but the remains of a volcanised earth, the colour of which is that of the  element, by which it was long consumed. Funchal, the capital town of the  islands is situated in long. 19 deg.. 20'. 30.\" in lat. 32 deg. 37'. 40\". This town  is far from handsome, the streets are narrow and the houses in general ill  built: the highest part of the island is the Pic de Ruvio, which rises  about two hundred metres above the level of the sea. The population of  Madeira is from 85,000 to 90,000, inhabitants as we are assured by a person  worthy of credit, who has resided for some time in that fine colony.    We sailed in this manner along the coast of Madeira, because the intention  of the commander was to send a boat on shore for refreshments; but being  surprised by a calm under the land, we were afraid of approaching too near,  lest we should not be able to stem the strong currents which set towards  it. A gentle breeze arising, enabled us to get out to sea, where the wind  became favorable, and pretty brisk; it was resolved that the boat should  not go on shore: and we resumed our course going at eight knots. We had  remained three hours opposite Funchal bay. At nightfall Madeira was in full  sight: the next morning at sun-rise we saw the islands called Salvages, and  in the evening we descried the Pico of Teneriffe, on the island of that  name. This lofty mountain, behind which the sun had just set, presented a  sight truly magnificent; its summit seemed to be crowned with fire: its  elevation above the level of the sea, is 3711 metres; it is situated in  lat. 28 deg. 17' and in long. 19 deg.. Several persons on board affirmed that they  saw the Pico at eight o'clock in the morning; and yet we were at least  thirty leagues distant from it; the sky it is true, was extremely clear.    The commander resolved to send a boat to St. Croix, one of the principal  towns in the island, to fetch fruits, and some filtering stones, which are  made in that town; they are only a kind of mortar, made of the volcanic  stone of the country. In consequence, during the whole night we made short  tacks; the next morning we coasted the island, at the distance of two  musket shot, and passed under the guns of a little fort, called _Fort  Francais_. One of our companions leaped for joy, at the sight of this  little fort, which was raised in haste by a few Frenchmen, when the  English, under Admiral Nelson, attempted to take possession of the Colony.  It was there, said he, that a numerous fleet, commanded by one of the  bravest Admirals of the English navy, failed before a handful of French,  who covered themselves with glory and saved Teneriffe; the Admiral was  obliged to take flight, after having lost an arm in the contest, which was  long and obstinate.    Having doubled a point which extends into the sea, we entered the bay, at  the bottom of which is the town of St. Croix. The appearance of Teneriffe  is majestic: the whole island is composed of mountains, which are extremely  high, and crowned with rocks terrifying from their size, which on the north  side, seem to rise perpendicularly above the surface of the ocean, and to  threaten every moment to crush by their fall, the vessels which pass near  their base. Above them all rises the Pico, the summit of which is lost in  the clouds. We did not perceive that the Pic was constantly covered with  snow as some voyagers affirm, nor that it vomits forth lava of melted  metal; for when we observed it, its summit seemed intirely destitute of  snow and of volcanic eruptions. At the foot of the mountain, and up to a  certain elevation excavations filled with sulphur are observed; and in its  neighbourhood several of the sepulchral caverns of the Guanches, the  ancient inhabitants of the island.    Towards noon the _Echo_ corvette, which had parted company, rejoined us,  and passed under the stern of the frigate: she was ordered to imitate our  manoeuvres, which she instantly did; she did not send any boat on shore.  Thus united, we lay to together in the bay of St. Croix. About four o'clock  in the afternoon, the boat having returned on board we directed our course  for Senegal. They had bought in the town some earthen jars of a large size,  precious wines, oranges, lemons, banian figs, and vegetables of all kinds.    Several unfortunate Frenchmen were on the island who had been long  prisoners of war; they lived upon what the Spaniards chose to give them.  They had been restored to liberty on the conclusion of peace, and waited  only for a favorable opportunity to return to France. Their entreaties to  the officer who commanded the boat were useless; he had the cruelty to  refuse to restore them to their country and their families. In this boat  there was another officer M. Laperere, who strongly insisted on bringing  away these unfortunate persons; his entreaties could not move him who  commanded the boat.    The depravity of morals at St. Croix is extreme; so much so that when the  women heard that some Frenchmen were arrived in the town, they placed  themselves at their doors, and when they passed, urged them to enter. All  this is usually done in the presence of the husbands, who have no right to  oppose it, because the Holy Inquisition will have it so, and because the  monks who are very numerous in the island take care that this custom is  observed. They possess the art of blinding the husbands, by means of the  _prestiges_ of religion, which they abuse in the highest degree; they cure  them of their jealousy, to which they are much inclined, by assuring them  that their passion, which they call ridiculous, or conjugal mania, is  nothing but the persecution of Satan which torments them, and from which  they alone are able to deliver them, by inspiring their dear consorts with  some religious sentiments. These abuses are almost inevitable in a burning  climate, where the passion of love is often stronger than reason, and  sometimes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#3)"],[1,"at the blank wall before her. With  her little satin shoe she tapped the carpet, biting her under lip and  seeming to be listening. Nothing stirred. Not even an echo of busy Bond  Street penetrated to the place. Mrs. Irvin unfastened her cloak and  allowed it to fall back upon the settee. Her bare shoulders looked waxen  and unnatural in the weird light which shone down upon them. She was  breathing rapidly.    The minutes passed by in unbroken silence. So still was the room that  Mrs. Irvin could hear the faint crackling sound made by the burning  charcoal in the brass vessel near her. Wisps of blue-grey smoke arose  through the perforated lid and she began to watch them fascinatedly,  so lithe they seemed, like wraiths of serpents creeping up the green  draperies.    So she was seated, her foot still restlessly tapping, but her gaze  arrested by the hypnotic movements of the smoke, when at last a sound  from the outer world, penetrated to the room. A church clock struck the  hour of seven, its clangor intruding upon the silence only as a muffled  boom. Almost coincident with the last stroke came the sweeter note of a  silver gong from somewhere close at hand.    Mrs. Irvin started, and her eyes turned instantly in the direction  of the greenly draped wall before her. Her pupils had grown suddenly  dilated, and she clenched her hands tightly.    The light above her head went out.    Now that the moment was come to which she had looked forward with  mingled hope and terror, long pent-up emotion threatened to overcome  her, and she trembled wildly.    Out of the darkness dawned a vague light and in it a shape seemed to  take form. As the light increased the effect was as though part of the  wall had become transparent so as to reveal the interior of an inner  room where a figure was seated in a massive ebony chair. The figure was  that of an oriental, richly robed and wearing a white turban. His long  slim hands, of the color of old ivory, rested upon the arms of  the chair, and on the first finger of the right hand gleamed a big  talismanic ring. The face of the seated man was lowered, but from under  heavy brows his abnormally large eyes regarded her fixedly.    So dim the light remained that it was impossible to discern the details  with anything like clearness, but that the clean-shaven face of the man  with those wonderful eyes was strikingly and intellectually handsome  there could be no doubt.    This was Kazmah, \"the dream reader,\" and although Mrs. Irvin had seen  him before, his statuesque repose and the weirdness of his unfaltering  gaze thrilled her uncannily.    Kazmah slightly raised his hand in greeting: the big ring glittered in  the subdued light.    \"Tell me your dream,\" came a curious mocking voice; \"and I will read its  portent.\"    Such was the set formula with which Kazmah opened all interviews. He  spoke with a slight and not unmusical accent. He lowered his hand again.  The gaze of those brilliant eyes remained fixed upon the woman's face.  Moistening her lips, Mrs. Irvin spoke.    \"Dreams! What I have to say does not belong to dreams, but to reality!\"  She laughed unmirthfully. \"You know well enough why I am here.\"    She paused.    \"Why are you here?\"    \"You know! You know!\" Suddenly into her voice had come the unmistakable  note of hysteria. \"Your theatrical tricks do not impress me. I know what  you are! A spy--an eavesdropper who watches--watches, and listens! But  you may go too far! I am nearly desperate--do you understand?--nearly  desperate. Speak! Move! Answer me!\"    But Kazmah preserved his uncanny repose.    \"You are distracted,\" he said. \"I am sorry for you. But why do you come  to me with your stories of desperation? You have insisted upon seeing  me. I am here.\"    \"And you play with me--taunt me!\"    \"The remedy is in your hands.\"    \"For the last time, I tell you I will never do it! Never, never, never!\"    \"Then why do you complain? If you cannot afford to pay for your  amusements, and you refuse to compromise in a simple manner, why do you  approach me?\"    \"Oh, my God!\" She moaned and swayed dizzily--\"have pity on me! Who are  you, what are you, that you can bring ruin on a woman because--\" She  uttered a choking sound, but continued hoarsely, \"Raise your head. Let  me see your face. As heaven is my witness, I am ruined--ruined!\"    \"Tomorrow--\"    \"I cannot wait for tomorrow--\"    That quivering, hoarse cry betrayed a condition of desperate febrile  excitement. Mrs. Irvin was capable of proceeding to the wildest  extremities. Clearly the mysterious Egyptian recognized this to be the  case, for slowly raising his hand:    \"I will communicate with you,\" he said, and the words were spoken almost  hurriedly. \"Depart in peace--\"; a formula wherewith he terminated every  seance. He lowered his hand.    The silver gong sounded again--and the dim light began to fade.    Thereupon the unhappy woman acted; the long suppressed outburst came at  last. Stepping rapidly to the green transparent veil behind which Kazmah  was seated, she wrenched it asunder and leapt toward the figure in the  black chair.    \"You shall not trick me!\" she panted. \"Hear me out or I go straight to  the police--now--now!\" She grasped the hands of Kazmah as they rested  motionless, on the chair-arms.    Complete darkness came.    Out of it rose a husky, terrified cry--a second, louder cry; and then a  long, wailing scream... horror-laden as that of one who has touched some  slumbering reptile....        CHAPTER IV. THE CLOSED DOOR    Rather less than five minutes later a taxicab drew up in old Bond  Street, and from it Quentin Gray leapt out impetuously and ran in at the  doorway leading to Kazmah's stairs. So hurried was his progress that  he collided violently with a little man who, carrying himself with a  pronounced stoop, was slinking furtively out.    The little man reeled at the impact and almost fell, but:    \"Hang it all!\" cried Gray irritably. \"Why the devil don't you look where  you're going!\"    He glared angrily into the face of the other. It was a peculiar and  rememberable face, notable because of a long, sharp, hooked nose  and very little, foxy, brown eyes; a sly face to which a small, fair  moustache only added insignificance. It was crowned by a wide-brimmed  bowler hat which the man wore pressed down upon his ears like a Jew  pedlar.    \"Why!\" cried Gray, \"this is the second time tonight you have jostled  me!\"    He thought he had recognized the man for the same who had been following  himself, Mrs. Irvin and Sir Lucien Pyne along old Bond Street.    A smile, intended to be propitiatory, appeared upon the pale face.    \"No, sir, excuse me, sir--\"    \"Don't deny it!\" said Gray angrily. \"If I had the time I should give you  in charge as a suspicious loiterer.\"    Calling to the cabman to wait, he ran up the stairs to the second floor  landing. Before the painted door bearing the name of Kazmah he halted,  and as the door did not open, stamped impatiently, but with no better  result.    At that, since there was neither bell nor knocker, he raised his fist  and banged loudly.    No one responded to the summons.    \"Hi, there!\" he shouted. \"Open the door! Pyne! Rita!\"    Again he banged--and yet again. Then he paused, listening, his ear  pressed to the panel.    He could detect no sound of movement within. Fists clenched, he stood  staring at the closed door, and his fresh color slowly deserted him and  left him pale.    \"Damn him!\" he muttered savagely. \"Damn him! he has fooled me!\"    Passionate and self-willed, he was shaken by a storm of murderous anger.  That Pyne had planned this trick, with Rita Irvin's consent, he did not  doubt, and his passive dislike of the man became active hatred of the  woman he dared not think. He had for long looked upon Sir Lucien in  the light of a rival, and the irregularity of his own infatuation for  another's wife in no degree lessened his resentment.    Again he pressed his ear to the door, and listened intently. Perhaps  they were hiding within. Perhaps this charlatan, Kazmah, was an  accomplice in the pay of Sir Lucien. Perhaps this was a secret place of  rendezvous.    To the manifest absurdity of such a conjecture he was blind in his  anger. But that he was helpless, befooled, he recognized; and with a  final muttered imprecation he turned and slowly descended the stair.  A lingering hope was dispelled when, looking right and left along Bond  Street, he failed to perceive the missing pair.    The cabman glanced at him interrogatively. \"I shall not require you,\"  said Gray, and gave the man half-a-crown.    Busy with his poisonous conjectures, he remained all unaware of the  presence of a furtive, stooping figure which lurked behind the railings  of the arcade at this point linking old Bond Street to Albemarle Street.  Nor had the stooping stranger any wish to attract Gray's attention.  Most of the shops in the narrow lane were already closed, although the  florist's at the corner remained open, but of the shadow which lay along  the greater part of the arcade this alert watcher took every advantage.  From the recess formed by a shop door he peered out at Gray, where the  light of a street lamp fell upon him, studying his face, his movements,  with unrelaxing vigilance.    Gray, following some moments of indecision, strode off towards  Piccadilly. The little man came out cautiously from his hiding-place  and looked after him. Out of a dark porch, ten paces along Bond Street,  appeared a burly figure to fall into step a few yards behind Gray. The  little man licked his lips appreciatively and returned to the doorway  below the premises of Kazmah.    Reaching Piccadilly, Gray stood for a time on the corner, indifferent  to the jostling of passers-by. Finally he crossed, walked along to  the Prince's Restaurant, and entered the lobby. He glanced at his  wrist-watch. It registered the hour of seven-twenty-five.    He cancelled his order for a "]]]
