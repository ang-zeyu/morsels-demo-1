At times he had managed  affairs for Tom, and helped him finance projects. Ned was now an  important bank official, and since the United States had entered the  war had had charge of some Red Cross work, as well as Liberty Bond  campaigns.    Somehow, as she sat there in the craft which seemed disabled, Mary  Nestor could not help thinking of Tom's many activities, in some of  which she had shared.    \"Oh, if he falls now, and is killed!\" she thought. \"Oh, what will  happen to us?\"    \"It's all right, Mary! Don't worry! It's all right!\" cried Tom, through  the speaking tube.    \"What's that? I can't hear you very well!\" she called back.    \"No wonder, with the racket this motor is making,\" he answered.  \"Why  can't something be done so you can talk in an aeroplane as well as in a  balloon? That's an idea! If I could tell you what was the matter now  you wouldn't be a bit frightened, for it isn't anything. But, as it  is--\"    \"What are you saying, Tom? I can't hear you!\" cried Mary, still much  frightened.    \"I say it's all right--don't get scared. And don't jump!\" Tom shouted  until his ears buzzed. \"It's all nonsense--having a motor making so  much noise one can't talk!\" he went on, irritatedly.    A strange idea had come to the young inventor, but there was no time to  think of it now. Mentally he registered a vow to take up this idea and  work on it as soon as possible. But, just now, the aeroplane needed all  his attention.    As he had told Mary, there was really nothing approaching any great  danger. But it was rather an anxious moment. If Tom had been alone he  would have thought little of it, but with Mary along he felt a double  responsibility.    What had happened was that the craft had suddenly gone into an \"air  pocket\" or partial vacuum, and there had been a sudden fall and a slide  slip. In trying to stop this too quickly Tom had broken one of his  controls, and he was busily engaged in putting an auxiliary one in  place and trying to reassure Mary at the same time.    \"But it's mighty hard trying to do that through a speaking tube with a  motor making a noise like a boiler factory,\" mused the young inventor.  Tom worked quickly and to good purpose. In a few moments, though to  Mary they seemed like hours, the machine was again gliding along on a  level keel, and Tom breathed more easily.    \"And now for my great idea!\" he told himself.    But it was some time before he could give his attention to that.          CHAPTER III    THE BIG OFFER      Working with all the skill he possessed, Tom had got the aeroplane in  proper working order again. As has been said, the accident was a  trivial one, and had he been alone, or with an experienced aviator, he  would have thought little of it. Then, very likely, he would have  volplaned to earth and made the repairs there. But he did not want to  frighten Mary Nestor, so he fixed the control while gliding along, and  made light of it. Thus his passenger was reassured.    \"Are we all right?\" asked Mary through the tube, as they sailed along.    \"Right as a fiddle,\" answered Tom, shouting through the same means of  communication.    \"What's that about a riddle?\" asked Mary, in surprise at his seeming  flippancy at such a time.    \"I didn't say anything about a riddle--I said we are as fit as a  fiddle!\" cried Tom. \"Never mind. No use trying to talk with the racket  this motor makes, and it isn't the noisiest of its kind, either. I'll  tell you when we get down. Do you like it?\"    \"Yes, I like it better than I did at first,\" answered Mary, for she had  managed to understand the last of Tom's questions. Then he sailed a  little higher, circled about, and, a little later, not to get Mary too  tired and anxious, he headed for his landing field.    \"I'll take you home in the auto,\" he cried to his passenger.  \"We could  go up to your house this way--in style--if there was a field near by  large enough to land in. But there isn't. So it will have to be a  plain, every-day auto.\"    \"That's good enough for me,\" said Mary. \"Though this trip is  wonderful--glorious! I'll go again any time you ask me.\"    \"Well, I'll ask you,\" said Tom. \"And when I do maybe it won't be so  hard to hold a conversation. It will be more like this,\" and he shut  off the motor and began to glide gently down. The quiet succeeding the  terrific noise of the motor exhaust was almost startling, and Tom and  Mary could converse easily without using the tube.    Then followed the landing on the soft, springy turf, a little glide  over the ground, and the machine came to a halt, while mechanics ran  out of the hangar to take charge of it.    \"I'll just go in and change these togs,\" said Mary, as she alighted and  looked at her leather costume.    \"No, don't,\" advised Tom. \"You look swell in em. Keep 'em on.  They're  yours, and you'll need 'em when we go up again. Here comes the auto.  I'll take you right home in it. Keep the aviation suit on.    \"I wonder what Mr. Damon could have wanted,\" remarked Tom, as he drove  Mary along the country road.    \"He seemed very much excited,\" she replied.    \"Oh, he almost always is that way--blessing everything he can think of.  You know that. But this time it was different, I'll admit. I hope  nothing is the matter. I might have stopped and spoken to him, but I  was afraid if I did you'd back out and wouldn't come for a sky ride.\"    \"Well, I might have. But now that I've had one, even with an accident  thrown in, I'll go any time you ask me, Tom,\" and Mary smiled at the  young inventor.    \"Shucks, that wasn't a real accident!\" he laughed. \"But I do wonder  what Mr. Damon wanted.\"    \"Better go back and find out, Tom,\" advised Mary, as they stopped in  front of her house.    \"Oh, I want to come in and talk to you. Haven't had a chance for a good  talk today, that motor made such a racket.\"    \"No, go along now, but come back and see me this afternoon if you like.\"    \"I do like, all right! And I suppose Mr. Damon will be fussing until he  sees me. Well, glad you liked your first ride in the air, Mary--that  is, the first one of any account,\" for Mary had been in an aeroplane  before, though only up a little way--a sort of \"grass-cutting stunt,\"  Tom called it.    Waving farewell to the pretty girl, the young aviator turned the auto  about and speeded for his home and the shops adjoining it. His father  had not been well, of late, and Tom was a bit anxious about him.    \"Mr. Damon may bother him, though he wouldn't mean to,\" thought Tom.  \"He seemed to have his mind filled with some new idea. I wonder if it  is anything like mine? No, it couldn't be. Well, I'll soon find out,\"  and, putting his foot on the accelerator, Tom sent the machine along at  a pace that soon brought him within sight of his home.    \"Is father all right?\" he asked Mrs. Baggert, who was out on the front  porch, as though waiting for him.    \"Oh, yes, Tom, he's all right,\" the housekeeper answered.    \"Is Mr. Damon with him?\"    \"No.\"    \"He hasn't gone home, has he?\"    \"No, he's around somewhere. But some one else is with your father. Some  visitors.\"    \"Any relations?\"    \"No; strangers. They came to see you, and they're rather impatient. I  came out to see if you were in sight. Your father sent me.\"    \"Are they bothering him--talking business that I ought to attend to  when he's ill? That mustn't be.\"    \"Well, I suppose it is business that the strangers are talking over  with your father, Tom,\" said Mrs. Baggert, \"for I heard sums of money  spoken of. But your father seems to be all right, only a trifle anxious  that you should come.\"    \"Well, I'm here now and I'll attend to things. Where are the strangers,  and who are they?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered the housekeeper. \"I never saw them before, but  they're in the library with your father. Do you think they'll stay to  dinner? If you do, I'll have Eradicate or Koku catch and kill a  chicken.\"    \"If you let one do it don't tell the other about it,\" said Tom with a  laugh, \"or you'll have a chicken race around the yard that will make  the visitors sit up and take notice.\"    There was great rivalry between Eradicate Sampson, the aged colored  man, and Koku, the giant, and they were continually disputing. Each one  loved and served Tom in his own way, and there was jealousy between  them. Koku, the giant Tom had brought with him from the land where the  young inventor had been made captive, was a big, powerful man, and  could do things the aged colored servant could not attempt. But \"Rad,\"  as he was often called, and his mule \"Boomerang\" had long been fixtures  on the Swift homestead. But old age crept on apace with Eradicate,  though he hated to admit it, and Koku did many things the colored man  had formerly attended to, and Rad was always on the lookout not to be  supplanted. Hence Tom's warning to Mrs. Baggert about letting the two  be entrusted with the same mission of catching a chicken for the pot.    \"Better get the fowl yourself and say nothing to either of them about  it,\" Tom advised the housekeeper. \"Mr. Damon will stay to dinner, as he  always does when he comes, and as it's near twelve now, and as I may be  delayed talking business to these strangers, you'd better get up a  bigger meal than usual.\"    \"I will, Tom,\" promised Mrs. Baggert. And then the young inventor,  having seen that one of the men took the automobile to the garage, went  into the house.    \"Oh, here you are!\" was his father's greeting, as he came out into the  hall from the library. \"I've been waiting anxiously for you, my boy. I  couldn't think what was keeping you.\"    \"Oh, I had a little trouble with the air machine--nothing serious.\"    A moment later Tom was standing before two well-dressed,  prosperous-looking business men, who smiled pleasantly at him.    \"Mr. Thomas Swift?\" interrogated one, the elder, as he held out his  hand.    \"That's my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12855"],[0,"Elizabethan Sea-Dogs: A Chronicle of Drake and His Companions (#3)"],[1,"Mary; and his last ten years were spent in England, where he died in the  odor of sanctity as Governor of the Muscovy Company and citizen of  London. Whatever his faults, he was a hearty-good-fellow with his boon  companions; and the following 'personal mention' about his octogenarian  revels at Gravesend is well worth quoting exactly as the admiring  diarist wrote it down on the 27th of April, 1556, when the pinnace  _Serchthrift_ was on the point of sailing to Muscovy and the Directors  were giving it a great send-off.         After Master Cabota and divers gentlemen and gentlewomen had viewed       our pinnace, and tasted of such cheer as we could make them aboard,       they went on shore, giving to our mariners right liberal rewards;       and the good old Gentleman, Master Cabota, gave to the poor most       liberal alms, wishing them to pray for the good fortune and       prosperous success of the _Serchthrift_, our pinnace. And then, at       the sign of the Christopher, he and his friends banqueted, and       made me and them that were in the company great cheer; and for very       joy that he had to see the towardness of our intended discovery he       entered into the dance himself, amongst the rest of the young and       lusty company--which being ended, he and his friends departed, most       gently commending us to the governance of Almighty God.          CHAPTER II    HENRY VIII, KING OF THE ENGLISH SEA      The leading pioneers in the Age of Discovery were sons of Italy, Spain,  and Portugal.[2] Cabot, as we have seen, was an Italian, though he  sailed for the English Crown and had an English crew. Columbus, too, was  an Italian, though in the service of the Spanish Crown. It was the  Portuguese Vasco da Gama who in the very year of John Cabot's second  voyage (1498) found the great sea route to India by way of the Cape of  Good Hope. Two years later the Cortereals, also Portuguese, began  exploring the coasts of America as far northwest as Labrador. Twenty  years later again the Portuguese Magellan, sailing for the King of  Spain, discovered the strait still known by his name, passed through it  into the Pacific, and reached the Philippines. There he was killed. But  one of his ships went on to make the first circumnavigation of the  globe, a feat which redounded to the glory of both Spain and Portugal.  Meanwhile, in 1513, the Spaniard Balboa had crossed the Isthmus of  Panama and waded into the Pacific, sword in hand, to claim it for his  king. Then came the Spanish explorers--Ponce de Leon, De Soto, Coronado,  and many more--and later on the conquerors and founders of New  Spain--Cortes, Pizarro, and their successors.    [2: Basque fishermen and whalers apparently forestalled Jacques  Cartier's discovery of the St. Lawrence in 1535; perhaps they knew the  mainland of America before John Cabot in 1497. But they left no written  records; and neither founded an oversea dominion nor gave rights of  discovery to their own or any other race.]    During all this time neither France nor England made any lodgment in  America, though both sent out a number of expeditions, both fished on  the cod banks of Newfoundland, and each had already marked out her own  'sphere of influence.' The Portuguese were in Brazil; the Spaniards, in  South and Central America. England, by right of the Bristol voyages,  claimed the eastern coasts of the United States and Canada; France, in  virtue of Cartier's discovery, the region of the St. Lawrence. But,  while New Spain and New Portugal flourished in the sixteenth century,  New France and New England were yet to rise.    In the sixteenth century both France and England were occupied with  momentous things at home. France was torn with religious wars. Tudor  England had much work to do before any effective English colonies could  be planted. Oversea dominions are nothing without sufficient sea power,  naval and mercantile, to win, to hold, and foster them. But Tudor  England was gradually forming those naval and merchant services without  which there could have been neither British Empire nor United States.    Henry VIII had faults which have been trumpeted about the world from his  own day to ours. But of all English sovereigns he stands foremost as the  monarch of the sea. Young, handsome, learned, exceedingly accomplished,  gloriously strong in body and in mind, Henry mounted the throne in 1509  with the hearty good will of nearly all his subjects. Before England  could become the mother country of an empire overseas, she had to shake  off her medieval weaknesses, become a strongly unified modern state, and  arm herself against any probable combination of hostile foreign states.  Happily for herself and for her future colonists, Henry was richly  endowed with strength and skill for his task. With one hand he welded  England into political unity, crushing disruptive forces by the way.  With the other he gradually built up a fleet the like of which the world  had never seen. He had the advantage of being more independent of  parliamentary supplies than any other sovereign. From his thrifty father  he had inherited what was then an almost fabulous sum--nine million  dollars in cash. From what his friends call the conversion, and his  enemies the spoliation, of Church property in England he obtained many  millions more. Moreover, the people as a whole always rallied to his  call whenever he wanted other national resources for the national  defence.    Henry's unique distinction is that he effected the momentous change from  an ancient to a modern fleet. This supreme achievement constitutes his  real title to the lasting gratitude of English-speaking peoples. His  first care when he came to the throne in 1509 was for the safety of the  'Broade Ditch,' as he called the English Channel. His last great act was  to establish in 1546 'The Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs.'  During the thirty-seven years between his accession and the creation of  this Navy Board the pregnant change was made.    'King Henry loved a man.' He had an unerring eye for choosing the right  leaders. He delighted in everything to do with ships and shipping. He  mixed freely with naval men and merchant skippers, visited the  dockyards, promoted several improved types of vessels, and always  befriended Fletcher of Rye, the shipwright who discovered the art of  tacking and thereby revolutionized navigation. Nor was the King only a  patron. He invented a new type of vessel himself and thoroughly mastered  scientific gunnery. He was the first of national leaders to grasp the  full significance of what could be done by broadsides fired from sailing  ships against the mediaeval type of vessel that still depended more on  oars than on sails.    Henry's maritime rivals were the two greatest monarchs of continental  Europe, Francis I of France and Charles V of Spain. Henry, Francis, and  Charles were all young, all ambitious, and all exceedingly capable men.  Henry had the fewest subjects, Charles by far the most. Francis had a  compact kingdom well situated for a great European land power. Henry had  one equally well situated for a great European sea power. Charles ruled  vast dominions scattered over both the New World and the Old. The  destinies of mankind turned mostly on the rivalry between these three  protagonists and their successors.    Charles V was heir to several crowns. He ruled Spain, the Netherlands,  the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and important principalities in  northern Italy. He was elected Emperor of Germany. He owned enormous  oversea dominions in Africa; and the two Americas soon became New Spain.  He governed each part of his European dominions by a different title and  under a different constitution. He had no fixed imperial capital, but  moved about from place to place, a legitimate sovereign everywhere and,  for the most part, a popular one as well. It was his son Philip II who,  failing of election as Emperor, lived only in Spain, concentrated the  machinery of government in Madrid, and became so unpopular elsewhere.  Charles had been brought up in Flanders; he was genial in the Flemish  way; and he understood his various states in the Netherlands, which  furnished him with one of his main sources of revenue. Another and much  larger source of revenue poured in its wealth to him later on, in  rapidly increasing volume, from North and South America.    Charles had inherited a long and bitter feud with France about the  Burgundian dominions on the French side of the Rhine and about domains  in Italy; besides which there were many points of violent rivalry  between things French and Spanish. England also had hereditary feuds  with France, which had come down from the Hundred Years' War, and which  had ended in her almost final expulsion from France less than a century  before. Scotland, nursing old feuds against England and always afraid of  absorption, naturally sided with France. Portugal, small and open to  Spanish invasion by land, was more or less bound to please Spain.    During the many campaigns between Francis and Charles the English  Channel swarmed with men-of-war, privateers, and downright pirates.  Sometimes England took a hand officially against France. But, even when  England was not officially at war, many Englishmen were privateers and  not a few were pirates. Never was there a better training school of  fighting seamanship than in and around the Narrow Seas. It was a  continual struggle for an existence in which only the fittest survived.  Quickness was essential. Consequently vessels that could not increase  their speed were soon cleared off the sea.    Spain suffered a good deal by this continuous raiding. So did the  Netherlands. But such was the power of Charles that, although his navies  were much weaker than his armies, he yet was able to fight by sea on two  enormous fronts, first, in the Mediterranean against the Turks and other  Moslems,"]]]
