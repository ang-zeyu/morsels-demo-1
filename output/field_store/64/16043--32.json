Glinda's art could have opened any ordinary door, you may be sure, but  you must realize that this marble door of the island had been commanded  not to open save in obedience to one magic word, and therefore all  other magic words could have no effect upon it. The magic word that  guarded the door had probably been invented by Coo-ee-oh, who had now  forgotten it. The only way, then, to gain entrance to the sunken island  was to break the charm that held the door fast shut. If this could be  done no magic would be required to open it.    The next day the Sorceress and the Wizard again entered the boat and  made it submerge and go to the marble door, which they tried in various  ways to open, but without success.    \"We shall have to abandon this attempt, I think,\" said Glinda. \"The  easiest way to raise the island would be for us to gain admittance to  the Dome and then descend to the basement and see in what manner  Coo-ee-oh made the entire island sink or rise at her command. It  naturally occurred to me that the easiest way to gain admittance would  be by having the boat take us into the basement through the marble door  from which Coo-ee-oh launched it. But there must be other ways to get  inside the Dome and join Ozma and Dorothy, and such ways we must find  by study and the proper use of our powers of magic.\"    \"It won't be easy,\" declared the Wizard, \"for we must not forget that  Ozma herself understands considerable magic, and has doubtless tried to  raise the island or find other means of escape from it and failed.\"    \"That is true,\" returned Glinda, \"but Ozma's magic is fairy magic,  while you are a Wizard and I am a Sorceress. In this way the three of  us have a great variety of magic to work with, and if we should all  fail it will be because the island is raised and lowered by a magic  power none of us is acquainted with. My idea therefore is to seek--by  such magic as we possess--to accomplish our object in another way.\"    They made the circle of the Dome again in their boat, and once more saw  Ozma and Dorothy through their windows and exchanged signals with the  two imprisoned girls.    Ozma realized that her friends were doing all in their power to rescue  her and smiled an encouragement to their efforts. Dorothy seemed a  little anxious but was trying to be as brave as her companion.    After the boat had returned to the camp and Glinda was seated in her  tent, working out various ways by which Ozma and Dorothy could be  rescued, the Wizard stood on the shore dreamily eying the outlines of  the Great Dome which showed beneath the clear water, when he raised his  eyes and saw a group of strange people approaching from around the  lake. Three were young women of stately presence, very beautifully  dressed, who moved with remarkable grace. They were followed at a  little distance by a good-looking young Skeezer.    The Wizard saw at a glance that these people might be very important,  so he advanced to meet them. The three maidens received him graciously  and the one with the golden hair said:    \"I believe you are the famous Wizard of Oz, of whom I have often heard.  We are seeking Glinda, the Sorceress, and perhaps you can lead us to  her.\"    \"I can, and will, right gladly,\" answered the Wizard. \"Follow me,  please.\"    The little Wizard was puzzled as to the identity of the three lovely  visitors but he gave no sign that might embarrass them.    He understood they did not wish to be questioned, and so he made no  remarks as he led the way to Glinda's tent.    With a courtly bow the Wizard ushered the three visitors into the  gracious presence of Glinda, the Good.          Chapter Twenty-One    The Three Adepts      The Sorceress looked up from her work as the three maidens entered, and  something in their appearance and manner led her to rise and bow to  them in her most dignified manner. The three knelt an instant before  the great Sorceress and then stood upright and waited for her to speak.    \"Whoever you may be,\" said Glinda, \"I bid you welcome.\"    \"My name is Audah,\" said one.    \"My name is Aurah,\" said another.    \"My name is Aujah,\" said the third.    Glinda had never heard these names before, but looking closely at the  three she asked:    \"Are you witches or workers in magic?\"    \"Some of the secret arts we have gleaned from Nature,\" replied the  brownhaired maiden modestly, \"but we do not place our skill beside that  of the Great Sorceress, Glinda the Good.\"    \"I suppose you are aware it is unlawful to practice magic in the Land  of Oz, without the permission of our Ruler, Princess Ozma?\"    \"No, we were not aware of that,\" was the reply.  \"We have heard of  Ozma, who is the appointed Ruler of all this great fairyland, but her  laws have not reached us, as yet.\"    Glinda studied the strange maidens thoughtfully; then she said to them:    \"Princess Ozma is even now imprisoned in the Skeezer village, for the  whole island with its Great Dome, was sunk to the bottom of the lake by  the witchcraft of Coo-ee-oh, whom the Flathead Su-dic transformed into  a silly swan. I am seeking some way to overcome Coo-ee-oh's magic and  raise the isle to the surface again. Can you help me do this?\"    The maidens exchanged glances, and the white-haired one replied:    \"We do not know; but we will try to assist you.\"    \"It seems,\" continued Glinda musingly, \"that Coo-ee-oh derived most of  her witchcraft from three Adepts at Magic, who at one time ruled the  Flatheads. While the Adepts were being entertained by Coo-ee-oh at a  banquet in her palace, she cruelly betrayed them and after transforming  them into fishes cast them into the lake.    \"If I could find these three fishes and return them to their natural  shapes--they might know what magic Coo-ee-oh used to sink the island. I  was about to go to the shore and call these fishes to me when you  arrived. So, if you will join me, we will try to find them.\"    The maidens exchanged smiles now, and the golden-haired one, Audah,  said to Glinda:    \"It will not be necessary to go to the lake. We are the three fishes.\"    \"Indeed!\" cried Glinda. \"Then you are the three Adepts at Magic,  restored to your proper forms?\"    \"We are the three Adepts,\" admitted Aujah.    \"Then,\" said Glinda, \"my task is half accomplished. But who destroyed  the transformation that made you fishes?\"    \"We have promised not to tell,\" answered Aurah; \"but this young Skeezer  was largely responsible for our release; he is brave and clever, and we  owe him our gratitude.\"    Glinda looked at Ervic, who stood modestly behind the Adepts, hat in  hand. \"He shall be properly rewarded,\" she declared, \"for in helping  you he has helped us all, and perhaps saved his people from being  imprisoned forever in the sunken isle.\"    The Sorceress now asked her guests to seat themselves and a long talk  followed, in which the Wizard of Oz shared.    \"We are quite certain,\" said Aurah, \"that if we could get inside the  Dome we could discover Coo-ee-oh's secrets, for in all her work, after  we became fishes, she used the formulas and incantations and arts that  she stole from us. She may have added to these things, but they were  the foundation of all her work.\"    \"What means do you suggest for our getting into the Dome?\" inquired  Glinda.    The three Adepts hesitated to reply, for they had not yet considered  what could be done to reach the inside of the Great Dome. While they  were in deep thought, and Glinda and the Wizard were quietly awaiting  their suggestions, into the tent rushed Trot and Betsy, dragging  between them the Patchwork Girl.    \"Oh, Glinda,\" cried Trot, \"Scraps has thought of a way to rescue Ozma  and Dorothy and all of the Skeezers.\"    The three Adepts could not avoid laughing merrily, for not only were  they amused by the queer form of the Patchwork Girl, but Trot's  enthusiastic speech struck them as really funny. If the Great Sorceress  and the famous Wizard and the three talented Adepts at Magic were  unable as yet to solve the important problem of the sunken isle, there  was little chance for a patched girl stuffed with cotton to succeed.    But Glinda, smiling indulgently at the earnest faces turned toward her,  patted the children's heads and said:    \"Scraps is very clever. Tell us what she has thought of, my dear.\"    \"Well,\" said Trot, \"Scraps says that if you could dry up all the water  in the lake the island would be on dry land, an' everyone could come  and go whenever they liked.\"    Glinda smiled again, but the Wizard said to the girls:    \"If we should dry up the lake, what would become of all the beautiful  fishes that now live in the water?\"    \"Dear me! That's so,\" admitted Betsy, crestfallen; \"we never thought of  that, did we Trot?\"    \"Couldn't you transform 'em into polliwogs?\" asked Scraps, turning a  somersault and then standing on one leg. \"You could give them a little,  teeny pond to swim in, and they'd be just as happy as they are as  fishes.\"    \"No indeed!\" replied the Wizard, severely. \"It is wicked to transform  any living creatures without their consent, and the lake is the home of  the fishes and belongs to them.\"    \"All right,\" said Scraps, making a face at him; \"I don't care.\"    \"It's too bad,\" sighed Trot, \"for I thought we'd struck a splendid  idea.\"    \"So you did,\" declared Glinda, her face now grave and thoughtful.  \"There is something in the Patchwork Girl's idea that may be of real  value to us.\"    \"I think so, too,\" agreed the golden-haired Adept. \"The top of the  Great Dome is only a few feet below the surface of the water. If we  could reduce the level of the lake until the Dome sticks a little above  the water, we could remove some of the glass and let ourselves down  into the village by means of ropes.\"    \"And there would be plenty of water left for the fishes to swim in,\"  added the white-haired"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],[0,"The Botanic Garden (#20)"],[1,"    The tuneful tones along her shadowy dells,       Her wrinkling founts with soft vibration shakes,       Curls her deep wells, and rimples all her lakes,    5  Thrills each wide stream, Britannia's isle that laves,       Her headlong cataracts, and circumfluent waves.       --Thick as the dews, which deck the morning flowers,       Or rain-drops twinkling in the sun-bright showers,       Fair Nymphs, emerging in pellucid bands,   10  Rise, as she turns, and whiten all the lands.           I. \"YOUR buoyant troops on dimpling ocean tread,       Wafting the moist air from his oozy bed,       AQUATIC NYMPHS!--YOU lead with viewless march       The winged vapours up the aerial arch,   15  On each broad cloud a thousand sails expand,       And steer the shadowy treasure o'er the land,       Through vernal skies the gathering drops diffuse,       Plunge in soft rains, or sink in silver dews.--       YOUR lucid bands condense with fingers chill   20  The blue mist hovering round the gelid hill;       In clay-form'd beds the trickling streams collect,       Strain through white sands, through pebbly veins direct;       Or point in rifted rocks their dubious way,       And in each bubbling fountain rise to day.    [_The winged vapours_. l. 14. See additional note No. XXV. on  evaporation.]    [_On each broad cloud_. l. 15. The clouds consist of condensed vapour,  the particles of which are too small separately to overcome the tenacity  of the air, and which therefore do not descend. They are in such small  spheres as to repel each other, that is, they are applied to each other  by such very small surfaces, that the attraction of the particles of  each drop to its own centre is greater than its attraction to the  surface of the drop in its vicinity; every one has observed with what  difficulty small spherules of quicksilver can be made to unite, owing to  the same cause; and it is common to see on riding through shallow water  on a clear day, numbers of very small spheres of water as they are  thrown from the horses feet run along the surface for many yards before  they again unite with it. In many cases these spherules of water, which  compose clouds, are kept from uniting by a surplus of electric fluid;  and fall in violent showers as soon as that is withdrawn from them, as  in thunder storms. See note on Canto I. l. 553.    If in this state a cloud becomes frozen, it is torn to pieces in its  descent by the friction of the air, and falls in white flakes of snow.  Or these flakes are rounded by being rubbed together by the winds, and  by having their angles thawed off by the warmer air beneath as they  descend; and part of the water produced by these angles thus dissolved  is absorbed into the body of the hailstone, as may be seen by holding a  lump of snow over a candle, and there becomes frozen into ice by the  quantity of cold which the hailstone possesses beneath the freezing  point, or which is produced by its quick evaporation in falling; and  thus hailstones are often found of greater or less density according as  they consist of a greater portion of snow or ice. If hailstones  consisted of the large drops of showers frozen in their descent, they  would consist of pure transparent ice.    As hail is only produced in summer, and is always attended with storms,  some philosophers have believed that the sudden departure of electricity  from a cloud may effect something yet unknown in this phenomenon; but it  may happen in summer independent of electricity, because the aqueous  vapour is then raised higher in the atmosphere, whence it has further to  fall, and there is warmer air below for it to fall through.]    [_Or sink in silver dews_. l. 18. During the coldness of the night the  moisture before dissolved in the air is gradually precipitated, and as  it subsides adheres to the bodies it falls upon. Where the attraction of  the body to the particles of water is greater than the attractions of  those particles to each other, it becomes spread upon their surface, or  slides down them in actual contact; as on the broad parts of the blades  of moist grass: where the attraction of the surface to the water is less  than the attraction of the particles of water to each other, the dew  stands in drops; as on the points and edges of grass or gorse, where the  surface presented to the drop being small it attracts it so little as  but just to support it without much changing its globular form: where  there is no attraction between the vegetable surface and the dew drops,  as on cabbage leaves, the drop does not come into contact with the leaf,  but hangs over it repelled, and retains it natural form, composed of the  attraction and pressure of its own parts, and thence looks like  quicksilver, reflecting light from both its surfaces. Nor is this owing  to any oiliness of the leaf, but simply to the polish of its surface, as  a light needle may be laid on water in the same manner without touching  it; for as the attractive powers of polished surfaces are greater when  in actual contact, so the repulsive power is greater before contact.]    [_The blue mist_. l. 20. Mists are clouds resting on the ground, they  generally come on at the beginning of night, and either fill the moist  vallies, or hang on the summits of hills, according to the degree of  moisture previously dissolved, and the eduction of heat from them. The  air over rivers during the warmth of the day suspends much moisture, and  as the changeful surface of rivers occasions them to cool sooner than  the land at the approach of evening, mists are most frequently seen to  begin over rivers, and to spread themselves over moist grounds, and fill  the vallies, while the mists on the tops of mountains are more properly  clouds, condensed by the coldness of their situation.    On ascending up the side of a hill from a misty valley, I have observed  a beautiful coloured halo round the moon when a certain thickness of  mist was over me, which ceased to be visible as soon as I emerged out of  it; and well remember admiring with other spectators the shadow of the  three spires of the cathedral church at Lichfield, the moon rising  behind it, apparently broken off, and lying distinctly over our heads as  if horizontally on the surface of the mist, which arose about as high as  the roof of the church. There are some curious remarks on shadows or  reflexions seen on the surface of mists from high mountains in Ulloa's  Voyages. The dry mist of summer 1783, was probably occasioned by  volcanic eruption, as mentioned in note on Chunda, Vol. II. and  therefore more like the atmosphere of smoke which hangs on still days  over great cities.    There is a dry mist, or rather a diminished transparence of the air,  which according to Mr. Saussure accompanies fair weather, while great  transparence of air indicates rain. Thus when large rivers two miles  broad, such as at Liverpool, appear narrow, it is said to prognosticate  rain; and when wide, fair weather. This want of transparence of the air  in dry weather, may be owing to new combinations or decompositions of  the vapours dissolved in it, but wants further investigation.

The phenomena of the tides have been well  investigated and satisfactorily explained by Sir Isaac Newton and Dr.  Halley from the reciprocal gravitations of the earth, moon, and sun. As  the earth and moon move round a centre of motion near the earth's  surface, at the same time that they are proceeding in their annual orbit  round the sun, it follows that the water on the side of the earth  nearest this centre of motion between the earth and moon will be more  attracted by the moon, and the waters on the opposite side of the"]]]
