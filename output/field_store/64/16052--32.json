There was much work, too, in teaching him to turn in  the cow-pony fashion, dropping his head almost to the ground and bunching  his feet altogether. For nothing of its size that lives is so deft in  dodging as the cow-pony. That part of El Sangre's education was not  completed, however, for only the actual work of a round-up could give him  the faultless surety of a good cow-pony. And, indeed, the ranchman  declared him useless for real roundup work.    \"A no-good, high-headed fool,\" he termed El Sangre, having sprained his  bank account with an attempt to buy the stallion from Terry the day  before.    At the end of a fortnight the first stranger passed, and ill-luck made it  a man from Craterville. He knew Terry at a glance, and the next morning  the rancher called Terry aside.    The work of that season, he declared, was going to be lighter than he had  expected. Much as he regretted it, he would have to let his new hand go.  Terry taxed him at once to get at the truth.    \"You've found out my name. That's why you're turning me off. Is that the  straight of it?\"    The sudden pallor of the other was a confession.    \"What's names to me?\" he declared. \"Nothing, partner. I take a man the  way I find him. And I've found you all right. The reason I got to let you  go is what I said.\"    But Terry grinned mirthlessly.    \"You know I'm the son of Black Jack Hollis,\" he insisted. \"You think that  if you keep me you'll wake up some morning to find your son's throat cut  and your cattle gone. Am I right?\"    \"Listen to me,\" the rancher said uncertainly. \"I know how you feel about  losing a job so suddenly when you figured it for a whole season. Suppose  I give you a whole month's pay and--\"    \"Damn your money!\" said Terry savagely. \"I don't deny that Black Jack was  my father. I'm proud of it. But listen to me, my friend. I'm living  straight. I'm working hard. I don't object to losing this job. It's the  attitude behind it that I object to. You'll not only send me away, but  you'll spread the news around--Black Jack's son is here! Am I a plague  because of that name?\"    \"Mr. Hollis,\" insisted the rancher in a trembling voice, \"I don't mean to  get you all excited. Far as your name goes, I'll keep your secret. I give  you my word on it. Trust me, I'll do what's right by you.\"    He was in a panic. His glance wavered from Terry's eyes to the revolver  at his side.    \"Do you think so?\" said Terry. \"Here's one thing that you may not have  thought of. If you and the rest like you refuse to give me honest work,  there's only one thing left for me--and that's dishonest work. You turn  me off because I'm the son of Black Jack; and that's the very thing that  will make me the son of Black Jack in more than name. Did you ever stop  to realize that?\"    \"Mr. Hollis,\" quavered the rancher, \"I guess you're right. If you want to  stay on here, stay and welcome, I'm sure.\"    And his eye hunted for help past the shoulder of Terry and toward the  shed, where his eldest son was whistling. Terry turned away in mute  disgust. By the time he came out of the bunkhouse with his blanket roll,  there was neither father nor son in sight. The door of the shack was  closed, and through the window he caught a glimpse of a rifle. Ten  minutes later El Sangre was stepping away across the range at a pace that  no mount in the cattle country could follow for ten miles.        CHAPTER 20      There was an astonishing deal of life in the town, however. A large  company had reopened some old diggings across the range to the north of  Calkins, and some small fragments of business drifted the way of the  little cattle town. Terry found a long line of a dozen horses waiting to  be shod before the blacksmith shop. One great wagon was lumbering out at  the farther end of the street, with the shrill yells of the teamster  calling back as he picked up his horses one by one with his voice.  Another freight-wagon stood at one side, blocking half the street. And a  stir of busy life was everywhere in the town. The hotel and store  combined was flooded with sound, and the gambling hall across the street  was alive even at midday.    It was noon, and Terry found that the dining room was packed to the last  chair. The sweating waiter improvised a table for him in the corner of  the hall and kept him waiting twenty minutes before he was served with  ham and eggs. He had barely worked his fork into the ham when a familiar  voice hailed him.    \"Got room for another at that table?\"    He looked up into the grinning face of Denver. For some reason it was a  shock to Terry. Of course, the second meeting was entirely coincidental,  but a still small voice kept whispering to him that there was fate in it.  He was so surprised that he could only nod. Denver at once appropriated a  chair and seated himself in his usual noiseless way.    When he rearranged the silver which the waiter placed before him, there  was not the faintest click of the metal. And Terry noted, too, a certain  nice justness in every one of Denver's motions. He was never fiddling  about with his hands; when they stirred, it was to do something, and when  the thing was done, the hands became motionless again.    His eyes did not rove; they remained fixed for appreciable periods  wherever they fell, as though Denver were finding something worth  remembering in the wall, or in a spot on the table. When his glance  touched on a face, it hung there in the same manner. After a moment one  would forget all the rest of his face, brutal, muscular, shapeless, and  see only the keen eyes.    Terry found it difficult to face the man. There was need to be excited  about something, to talk with passion, in order to hold one's own in the  presence of Denver, even when the chunky man was silent. He was not  silent now; he seemed in a highly cheerful, amiable mood.    \"Here's luck,\" he said. \"I didn't know this God-forsaken country could  raise as much luck as this!\"    \"Luck?\" echoed Terry.    \"Why not? D'you think I been trailing you?\"    He chuckled in his noiseless way. It gave Terry a feeling of expectation.  He kept waiting for the sound to come into that laughter, but it never  did. Suddenly he was frank, because it seemed utterly futile to attempt  to mask one's real thoughts from this fellow.    \"I don't know,\" he said, \"that it would surprise me if you _had_ been  tailing me. I imagine you're apt to do queer things, Denver.\"    Denver hissed, very softly and with such a cutting whistle to his breath  that Terry's lips remained open over his last word.    \"Forget that name!\" Denver said in a half-articulate tone of voice.    He froze in his place, staring straight before him; but Terry gathered an  impression of the most intense watchfulness--as though, while he stared  straight before him, he had sent other and mysterious senses exploring  for him. He seemed suddenly satisfied that all was well, and as he  relaxed, Terry became aware of a faint gleam of perspiration on the brow  of his companion.    \"Why the devil did you tell me the name if you didn't want me to use it?\"  he asked.    \"I thought you'd have some savvy; I thought you'd have some of your dad's  horse sense,\" said Denver.    \"No offense,\" answered Terry, with the utmost good nature.    \"Call me Shorty if you want,\" said Denver. In the meantime he was  regarding Terry more and more closely.    \"Your old man would of made a fight out of it if I'd said as much to him  as I've done to you,\" he remarked at length.    \"Really?\" murmured Terry.    And the portrait of his father swept back on him--the lean, imperious,  handsome face, the boldness of the eyes. Surely a man all fire and  powder, ready to explode. He probed his own nature. He had never been  particularly quick of temper--until lately. But he began to wonder if his  equable disposition might not rise from the fact that his life in Bear  Valley had been so sheltered. He had been crossed rarely. In the outer  world it was different. That very morning he had been tempted wickedly to  take the tall rancher by the throat and grind his face into the sand.    \"But maybe you're different,\" went on Denver. \"Your old man used to flare  up and be over it in a minute. Maybe you remember things and pack a  grudge with you.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said Terry, grown strangely meek. \"I hardly know.\"    Indeed, he thought, how little he really knew of himself. Suddenly he  said: \"So you simply happened over this way, Shorty?\"    \"Sure. Why not? I got a right to trail around where I want. Besides, what  would there be in it for me--following you?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Terry gravely. \"But I expect to find out sooner or  later. What else are you up to over here?\"    \"I have a little job in mind at the mine,\" said Denver. \"Something that  may give the sheriff a bit of trouble.\" He grinned.    \"Isn't it a little--unprofessional,\" said Terry dryly, \"for you to tell  me these things?\"    \"Sure it is, bo--sure it is! Worst in the world. But I can always tell a  gent that can keep his mouth shut. By the way, how many jobs you been  fired from already?\"    Terry started. \"How do you know that?\"    \"I just guess at things.\"    \"I started working for an infernal idiot,\" sighed Terry. \"When he learned  my name, he seemed to be afraid I'd start shooting up his place one of  these days.\"    \"Well, he was a wise gent. You ain't cut out for working, son. Not a bit.  It'd be a shame to let you go to waste simply raising calluses on your  hands.\"    \"You talk well,\" sighed Terry, \"but you can't convince me.\"    \"Convince you? Hell, I ain't trying to convince your father's son. You're  like Black Jack. You got to find out yourself. We was with a Mick, once.  Red-headed devil, he was. I says to Black Jack: 'Don't crack no jokes  about the Irish around this guy!'    \"'Why not?' says your dad.    \"'Because there'd be an explosion,' says I.    \"'H'm,' says Black Jack, and lifts his eyebrows in a way"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#20)"],[1," Swiftly ascending this path she came at length to a point where it was  possible to see some distance ahead. The ascent became hardly  noticeable. Then, as she turned a bend of the trail, the light grew  brighter and brighter, until presently all was open and clear. An oval  space, covered with stones, lay before her. A big, blasted chestnut  stood near by. Beyond was the dim, purple haze of distance. Above, the  pale, blue sky just faintly rose-tinted by the setting sun. Far to her  left the scraggly trees of a low hill were tipped with orange and  russet shades. She had reached the summit.    Desolate and lonely was this little plateau. Helen felt immeasurably  far away from home. Yet she could see in the blue distance the  glancing river, the dark fort, and that cluster of cabins which marked  the location of Fort Henry. Sitting upon the roots of the big chestnut  tree she gazed around. There were the remains of a small camp-fire.  Beyond, a hollow under a shelving rock. A bed of dry leaves lay packed  in this shelter. Some one had been here, and she doubted not that it  was the borderman.    She was so tired and her wrist pained so severely that she lay back  against the tree-trunk, closed her eyes and rested. A weariness, the  apathy of utter exhaustion, came over her. She wished the bordermen  would hurry and come before she went to sleep.    Drowsily she was sinking into slumber when a long, low rumble aroused  her. How dark it had suddenly become! A sheet of pale light flared  across the overcast heavens.    \"A storm!\" exclaimed Helen. \"Alone on this mountain-top with a storm  coming. Am I frightened? I don't believe it. At least I'm safe from  that ruffian Brandt. Oh! if my borderman would only come!\"    Helen changed her position from beside the tree, to the hollow under  the stone. It was high enough to permit of her sitting upright, and  offered a safe retreat from the storm. The bed of leaves was soft and  comfortable. She sat there peering out at the darkening heavens.    All beneath her, southward and westward was gray twilight. The  settlement faded from sight; the river grew wan and shadowy. The ruddy  light in the west was fast succumbing to the rolling clouds. Darker  and darker it became, until only one break in the overspreading vapors  admitted the last crimson gleam of sunshine over hills and valley,  brightening the river until it resembled a stream of fire. Then the  light failed, the glow faded. The intense blackness of night  prevailed.    Out of the ebon west came presently another flare of light, a quick,  spreading flush, like a flicker from a monster candle; it was followed  by a long, low, rumbling roll.    Helen felt in those intervals of unutterably vast silence, that she  must shriek aloud. The thunder was a friend. She prayed for the storm  to break. She had withstood danger and toilsome effort with fortitude;  but could not brave this awful, boding, wilderness stillness.    Flashes of lightning now revealed the rolling, pushing, turbulent  clouds, and peals of thunder sounded nearer and louder.    A long swelling moan, sad, low, like the uneasy sigh of the sea,  breathed far in the west. It was the wind, the ominous warning of the  storm. Sheets of light were now mingled with long, straggling ropes of  fire, and the rumblings were often broken by louder, quicker  detonations.    Then a period, longer than usual, of inky blackness succeeded the  sharp flaring of light. A faint breeze ruffled the leaves of the  thicket, and fanned Helen's hot cheek. The moan of the wind became  more distinct, then louder, and in another instant like the far-off  roar of a rushing river. The storm was upon her. Helen shrank closer  against the stone, and pulled her jacket tighter around her  trembling form.    A sudden, intense, dazzling, blinding, white light enveloped her. The  rocky promontory, the weird, giant chestnut tree, the open plateau,  and beyond, the stormy heavens, were all luridly clear in the flash of  lightning. She fancied it was possible to see a tall, dark figure  emerging from the thicket. As the thunderclap rolled and pealed  overhead, she strained her eyes into the blackness waiting for the  next lightning flash.    It came with brilliant, dazing splendor. The whole plateau and thicket  were as light as in the day. Close by the stone where she lay crept  the tall, dark figure of an Indian. With starting eyes she saw the  fringed clothing, the long, flying hair, and supple body peculiar to  the savage. He was creeping upon her.    Helen's blood ran cold; terror held her voiceless. She felt herself  sinking slowly down upon the leaves.          CHAPTER XII    The sun had begun to cast long shadows the afternoon of Helen's hunt  for Jonathan, when the borderman, accompanied by Wetzel, led a string  of horses along the base of the very mountain she had ascended.    \"Last night's job was a good one, I ain't gainsayin'; but the redskin  I wanted got away,\" Wetzel said gloomily.    \"He's safe now as a squirrel in a hole. I saw him dartin' among the  trees with his white eagle feathers stickin' up like a buck's flag,\"  replied Jonathan. \"He can run. If I'd only had my rifle loaded! But  I'm not sure he was that arrow-shootin' Shawnee.\"    \"It was him. I saw his bow. We ought'er taken more time an' picked him  out,\" Wetzel replied, shaking his head gravely. \"Though mebbe that'd  been useless. I think he was hidin'. He's precious shy of his red  skin. I've been after him these ten year, an' never ketched him  nappin' yet. We'd have done much toward snuffin' out Legget an' his  gang if we'd winged the Shawnee.\"    \"He left a plain trail.\"    \"One of his tricks. He's slicker on a trail than any other Injun on  the border, unless mebbe it's old Wingenund, the Huron. This Shawnee'd  lead us many a mile for nuthin', if we'd stick to his trail. I'm long  ago used to him. He's doubled like an old fox, run harder'n a skeered  fawn, an', if needs be, he'll lay low as cunnin' buck. I calkilate  once over the mountain, he's made a bee-line east. We'll go on with  the hosses, an' then strike across country to find his trail.\"    \"It 'pears to me, Lew, that we've taken a long time in makin' a show  against these hoss-thieves,\" said Jonathan.    \"I ain't sayin' much; but I've felt it,\" replied Wetzel.    \"All summer, an' nothin' done. It was more luck than sense that we run  into those Injuns with the hosses. We only got three out of four, an'  let the best redskin give us the slip. Here fall is nigh on us, with  winter comin' soon, an' still we don't know who's the white traitor in  the settlement.\"    \"I said it's be a long, an' mebbe, our last trail.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because these fellars red or white, are in with a picked gang of the  best woodsmen as ever outlawed the border. We'll get the Fort Henry  hoss-thief. I'll back the bright-eyed lass for that.\"    \"I haven't seen her lately, an' allow she'd left me word if she  learned anythin'.\"    \"Wal, mebbe it's as well you hain't seen so much of her.\" In silence  they traveled and, arriving at the edge of the meadow, were about to  mount two of the horses, when Wetzel said in a sharp tone:    \"Look!\"    He pointed to a small, well-defined moccasin track in the black earth  on the margin of a rill.    \"Lew, it's a woman's, sure's you're born,\" declared Jonathan.    Wetzel knelt and closely examined the footprint; \"Yes, a woman's, an'  no Injun.\"    \"What?\" Jonathan exclaimed, as he knelt to scrutinize the imprint.    \"This ain't half a day old,\" added Wetzel. \"An' not a redskin's  moccasin near. What d'you reckon?\"    \"A white girl, alone,\" replied Jonathan as he followed the trail a  short distance along the brook. \"See, she's makin' upland. Wetzel,  these tracks could hardly be my sister's, an' there's only one other  girl on the border whose feet will match 'em! Helen Sheppard has  passed here, on her way up the mountain to find you or me.\"    \"I like your reckonin'.\"    \"She's suddenly discovered somethin', Injuns, hoss-thieves, the Fort  Henry traitor, or mebbe, an' most likely, some plottin'. Bein' bound  to secrecy by me, she's not told my brother. An' it must be call for  hurry. She knows we frequent this mountain-top; said Eb told her about  the way we get here.\"    \"I'd calkilate about the same.\"    \"What'll you do? Go with me after her?\" asked Jonathan.    \"I'll take the hosses, an' be at the fort inside of an hour. If  Helen's gone, I'll tell her father you're close on her trail. Now  listen! It'll be dark soon, an' a storm's comin'. Don't waste time on  her trail. Hurry up to the rock. She'll be there, if any lass could  climb there. If not, come back in the mornin', hunt her trail out, an'  find her. I'm thinkin', Jack, we'll find the Shawnee had somethin' to  do with this. Whatever happens after I get back to the fort, I'll  expect you hard on my trail.\"    Jonathan bounded across the brook and with an easy lope began the  gradual ascent. Soon he came upon a winding path. He ran along this  for perhaps a quarter of an hour, until it became too steep for rapid  traveling, when he settled down to a rapid walk. The forest was  already dark. A slight rustling of the leaves beneath his feet was the  only sound, except at long intervals the distant rumbling of thunder.    The mere possibility of Helen's being alone on that mountain seeking  him, made Jonathan's heart beat as it never had before. For weeks he  had avoided her, almost forgot her. He had conquered the strange,  yearning weakness which assailed him after that memorable Sunday, and  once more the silent shaded glens, the mystery of the woods, the  breath of his wild, free life had claimed him. But now as this  evidence of her spirit, her recklessness, was before him, and he  remembered Betty's avowal, a pain, which was almost physical, tore at  his heart. How terrible it would be if she came to her death through  him! He pictured the big, alluring eyes, the perfect lips, "]]]
