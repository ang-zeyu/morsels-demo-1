The Caliph desired to see so great a genius, and to possess him at his  court. Osmyn was overwhelmed with favours; he sung the praises of the  Caliph with a delicacy that other poets were far from being able to  imitate. The Caliph admired delicate praise the more because it is rare  at court.    So much merit and favour besides, soon created the jealousy of other  poets, and likewise of the courtiers. Even those, who had showed  themselves the most enthusiastic admirers of Osmyn's talents, feared to  see themselves eclipsed by this new comer, and resolved to destroy the  idol they had raised so much higher than they wished.    One of the poets, Osmyn's enemy, was employed to compose a satire  against the Caliph, and it was agreed that this should be circulated  under the favourite's name. From that time the avenger of the common  cause never quitted Osmyn, nor ceased to load him with praises and  caresses.    One day when Osmyn delivered an extempore poem before the Caliph, his  rival, after having warmly applauded him, cast down his eyes by  accident, and saw shining on the floor one of the pastilles that Osmyn,  who was led away by the vivacity of his declamation, had let fall by  mistake. The traitor snatched it up, and put it mechanically in his  mouth.    The pastille produced its effect; the poet felt a sudden inspiration,  left the hall and flew to compose the projected satire. He was surprised  at his own aptitude; the verses cost him no trouble, but flowed of  themselves. The bitterest expressions escaped from his pen without his  seeking for them. In short, in an instant, he brought forth a true  _chef-d'oeuvre_ of malice.    He continued some moments in ecstacy with his work, and carried it in  triumph to his friends--or rather to his accomplices. The satire was  received with the liveliest applause: it was the pure and vigorous style  of Osmyn. The writer had imitated his handwriting; and soon the libel  was spread about in his name.    Murmurs arose on all sides against the ingratitude of Osmyn. The satire  fell into the hands of the Caliph, who in his rage ordered the  unfortunate Osmyn to be stript of all his property, and driven from  Bagdad. Osmyn, overpowered by the blow, could not defend himself;  besides, how could he make his innocence heard amidst the cries of his  calumniators.    After having wandered a long time, every where imploring pity--sometimes  meeting with kindness, but oftener repulsed with selfishness--he  arrived, at nightfall, before a superb country house, magnificently  illuminated. He heard the accents of joy mingled with the sounds of a  brilliant concert of music, and saw all the signs of a splendid fete.  However, the thunder began to roll, the sky was obscured by heavy  clouds, and Osmyn's miserable clothing was soon drenched by the rain.    He approached this beautiful house, in hopes to find there, if not  hospitality for the night, at least an asylum for some minutes. The  slaves perceived him, and said to him harshly--\"What do you ask,  beggar?\"    \"A humble shelter from the storm, a morsel of bread to appease my  hunger, and a little straw to rest my body on, borne down by fatigue.\"    \"Thou shalt have none of these.\"    \"For pity--\"    \"Begone!\"    \"See how it rains!--Hear how it thunders!\"    \"Go elsewhere, and come not to disturb by thy presence the pleasures of  our master.\"    Osmyn was on the point of obeying this order, when the master of the  house, who had witnessed this scene from a window, came down, called his  slaves, and ordered them to receive the unfortunate man, to procure him  clothes, a bed, and all he was in need of. \"Misery,\" said he, \"misery is  for him who revels in the presence of the poor, and suffers them to  plead for assistance in vain; and misfortune for the rich who, cloyed  with luxuries, refuse a morsel of bread to a famishing stranger. Poor  traveller, go and repose thyself, and may the Prophet send thee  refreshing slumbers, that thou mayst for a time forget thy sufferings.\"    \"Oh Heaven!\" cried Osmyn, \"what voice strikes my ear? It is the  voice--the voice of Zambri!\"    \"Zambri! what! do you know him?\"    \"Heavens! do I know him?--Do I know my brother?\"    \"You my brother!\" cried Zambri in his turn. \"Can it be? That voice--those  features, disfigured by poverty and misery. Ah! I recognise you, my dear  Osmyn!\"    No more need be said: he flew to embrace his brother; but Osmyn,  overcome by the excess of his joy, fell senseless at his feet.    He was conveyed into the finest apartment of the villa, every assistance  was afforded him, and he was soon restored. Zambri ordered him  magnificent apparel, and taking him by the hand, conducted him to the  banquet, and presented him to his friends. After the repast, Osmyn  related all the vicissitudes of his fortune, his long suffering, his  rapid glory, the jealousy and perfidy of his enemies, \"But thou,\" added  he, \"my dear Zambri, by what good fortune do I find you in such an  enviable situation? What! this beautiful house, this crowd of slaves,  these sumptuous ornaments!--to what dost thou owe them?\"    \"_To the receipt for preparing Sherbet,_\" said Zambri, smiling. \"Listen  to my story, it is very simple. Soon after we parted, I directed my  steps towards Teflis, where I sought only to gain a livelihood. On my  arrival, I went into the public places where the opulent people  assemble, to refresh themselves with ices and sherbet. I solicited  employment there, but was refused, and harshly sent away. Not knowing  what to do, and not having money to procure a subsistence, I went at  length to one of the obscure cafes, frequented by the lowest people. The  master of this wretched place, who was named Mehdad, agreed to accept my  services. I prepared a bottle of the liquor for which the good genius  had given me the receipt, but the ingredients of which, although cheap,  I had not before been able to purchase, and soon I found an immense  company crowding to Mehdad's cafe. The rich people also would take no  other; and Mehdad soon had before him the prospect of becoming opulent.    \"He had a daughter; she was young and beautiful; I became enamoured of  her, and ventured to ask her hand. I had preserved the secret of my  receipt. Mehdad was ignorant that he owed his good fortune to me, and  believed that it was through his own talent. He rejected my offer with  disdain, and drove me from his house. Poor fellow! he was not the first  who, without knowing it, had driven good luck from his home.    \"I had gained some money in his service; and I employed the fruit of my  economy in forming for myself an establishment in one of the public  gardens of Teflis, on the banks of the charming river Khur. Here I  erected a small, but elegant pavilion, and I sold my Sherbet to all the  promenaders of the garden. In a short time Mehdad, and all the cafes of  Teflis, were abandoned for my little pavilion. Zambri's Sherbet was  alone in demand: it was spoken of in all companies--it was taken at all  festivals. The garden of Zambri was crowded from morning till night. The  multitude was attracted towards my pavilion like swarms of flies towards  a honey-comb. I was compelled to erect a pavilion ten times larger than  the former, and I decorated it magnificently.    \"A year had scarcely elapsed before I had acquired a considerable  fortune. I quitted my new establishment, returned to the city, and  purchased merchandize of all descriptions. I prepared a great quantity  of this favourite liquor, to which I owe all my wealth. I sent it to all  the cities of Persia, and into the most distant countries. Heaven seemed  to smile on my exertions. A beautiful widow, aged twenty years, saw and  loved me; I was not insensible to her charms. We made mutual vows of  attachment, and marriage crowned my happiness.    \"We have acquired this charming retreat, and reside here during the most  beautiful season of the year, amongst our good friends, who, in  partaking our pleasures, add to them the charms of their society.    \"How many times, dear Osmyn, have my thoughts been occupied with thee!  Often have I said, in the midst of my prosperity, Where is my  brother?--where dwells Osmyn? No doubt the invaluable secret he  possesses has gained him an immense fortune, and raised him to the  pinnacle of honour. But I see that in these times happiness,  tranquillity, and perhaps riches, are more easily obtained by humble and  modest employment, than by splendid abilities. In the course of my  transactions, I have met with vexations and disappointments. Sometimes  my Sherbet has been imitated; but the fraud has always been discovered,  and the intrigues of my rivals have added to my reputation. At length I  have found that it is easier to satisfy the caprice than the judgment of  mankind, and that those who could not understand the merits of a clever  work, would readily agree upon the subject of a delicious and agreeable  beverage.\"    Thus spoke the good Zambri: he strove affectionately to console Osmyn.  The two brothers separated no more; and, thanks to the _receipt for  preparing_ _Sherbet_, they lived long together amidst the pleasures  that wealth commands, and the still more true and solid happiness  procured by peace and friendship.             *       *       *       *       *        THE NATURALIST.      BOTANY OF SHAKSPEARE.      At a recent meeting of the Medico-Botanical Society, a very interesting  dissertation on the medicinal plants which occur in the plays of  Shakspeare, from the pen of Mr. Rootsay, of Bristol, was read, and  excited considerable attention. The hebenon henbane alluded to in  _Hamlet_, the mandragora, the various plants so beautifully alluded to  in _Romeo and Juliet_, and in other dramas, were the subject of the  inquiry, and much classical information was displayed by the ingenious  author in the illustration of the subject.

In shape they are moderately broad  ovals, a good deal pointed towards the small end, but, as in the  Oriole, greatly elongated varieties are very common, and short  globular ones almost unknown. The texture of the egg is close and  hard, but they usually exhibit little or no gloss. In the colour of  the ground, as well as in the colour, extent, and character of the  markings, the eggs vary surprisingly. The ground-colour is in some  a clear pale greenish blue; in others pale blue; in others a dingy  olive; and in others again a pale stone-colour. The markings are  blackish brown, sepia and olive-brown, and rather pale inky purple.  Some have the markings small, sharply defined, and thinly sprinkled:  others are extensively blotched and streakily clouded; others are  freckled or smeared over the entire surface, so as to leave but  little, if any, of the ground-colour visible. Often several styles of  marking and shades of colouring are combined in the same egg. Almost  each nest of eggs exhibits some peculiarity, and varieties are  endless. With sixty or seventy eggs before one, it is easy to pick out  in almost every case all the eggs that belong to the same nest, and  this is a peculiarity that I have observed in the eggs of many members  of this family. All the eggs out of the same nest usually closely  resemble each other, while almost _any_ two eggs out of different  nests are markedly dissimilar.    They vary from 1.72 to 2.25 in length, and from 1.2 to 1.37 in width;  but the average of seventy-two eggs measured is 1.94 by 1.31.    Mandelli's men found four eggs of the larger Sikhim bird in Native  Sikhim, high up towards the snows, where they were shooting  Blood-Pheasants.    These eggs are long ovals, considerably pointed towards one end;  the shell is strong and firm, and has scarcely any gloss. The  ground-colour is pale bluish green, and the eggs are smudged and  clouded all over with pale sepia; on the top of the eggs there are a  few small spots and streaks of deep brownish black. They were found on  the 5th March, and vary in length from 1.83 to 1.96, in breadth from  1.18 to 1.25.      3. Corvus corone, Linn. _The Carrion-Crow_.    Corvus corone, _Linn., Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 295; _Hume, Rough Draft  N. & E._ no. 659[A].    [Footnote A: Mr. Hume, at one time separated the Indian Carrion-Crow  from _Corvus corone_ under the name _C. pseudo-corone_. In his  'Catalogue' he re-unites them. I quite agree with him that the two  birds are inseparable.--ED.]    The only Indian eggs of the Carrion-Crow which I have seen, and one of  which, with the parent bird, I owe to Mr. Brooks, were taken by the  latter gentleman on the 30th May at Sonamerg, Cashmere.    The eggs were broad ovals, somewhat compressed towards one end, and  of the regular Corvine type--a pretty pale green ground, blotched,  smeared, streaked, spotted, and clouded, nowhere very profusely but  most densely about the large end, with a greenish or olive-brown and  pale sepia. The brown is a brighter and greener, or duller and more  olive, lighter or darker, in different eggs, and even in different  parts of the same egg. The shell is fine and close, but has only a  faint gloss.    The eggs only varied from 1.67 to 1.68 in length, and from 1.14 to  1.18 in breadth.    Whether this bird breeds regularly or only as a straggler in Cashmere  we do not know; it is always overlooked and passed by as a \"Common  Crow.\" Future visitors to Cashmere should try and clear up both the  identity of the bird and all particulars about its nidification.      4. Corvus macrorhynchus, Wagler. _The Jungle-Crow_.    Corvus culminatus, _Sykes, Jerd. B, Ind._ ii, p. 295,  Corvus levaillantii; _Less., Hume, Rough Draft N. & E._ no. 660.    The Jungle-Crow (under which head I include[A] _C. culminatus,_  Sykes, _C. intermedius_, Adams, _C. andamanensis_, Tytler, and each  and all of the races that occur within our limits) breeds almost  everywhere in India, alike in the low country and in the hills both of  Southern and Northern India, to an elevation of fully 8000 feet.    [Footnote A: See 'Stray Feathers,' vol. ii. 1874, p. 243, and 'Lahore  to Yarkand,' p. 85.]    March to May is, I consider, the normal breeding-season; in the plains  the majority lay in April, rarely later, and in the hills in May; but  in the plains a few birds lay also in February.    The nest is placed as a rule on good-sized trees and pretty near their  summits. In the plains mangos and tamarinds seem to be preferred, but  I have found the nests on many different kinds of trees. The nest is  large, circular, and composed of moderate-sized twigs; sometimes it is  thick, massive, and compact; sometimes loose and straggling; always  with a considerable depression in the centre, which is smoothly lined  with large quantities of horsehair, or other stiff hair, grass,  grass-roots, cocoanut-fibre, &c. In the hills they use _any_ animal's  hair or fur, if the latter is pretty stiff. They do not, according to  my experience, affect luxuries in the way of soft down; it is always  something moderately stiff, of the coir or horsehair type; nothing  soft and fluffy. Coarse human hair, such as some of our native  fellow-subjects can boast of, is often taken, when it can be got, in  lieu of horsehair.    They lay four or five eggs. I have quite as often found the latter as  the former number. I have never myself seen six eggs in one nest, but  I have heard, on good authority, of six eggs being found.    Captain Unwin writes: \"I found a nest of the Bow-billed Corby in the  Agrore Valley, containing four eggs, on the 30th April. It was placed  in a Cheer tree about 40 feet from the ground, and was made of sticks  and lined with dry grass and hair.\"    Mr. W. Theobald makes the following remarks on the breeding of this  bird in the Valley of Cashmere:--    \"Lays in the third week of April. Eggs four in number, ovato-pyriform,  measuring from 1.6 to 1.7 in length and from 1.2 to 1.25 in breadth.  Colour green spotted with brown; valley generally. Nest placed in  Chinar and difficult trees.\"    Captain Hutton tells us that the Corby \"occurs at Mussoorie throughout  the year, and is very destructive to young fowls and pigeons; it  breeds in May and June, and selects a tall tree, near a house or  village, on which to build its nest, which is composed externally of  dried sticks and twigs, and lined with grass and hair, which latter  material it will pick from the backs of horses and cows, or from  skins of animals laid out to dry. I have had skins of the Surrow  (_Noemorhaedus thar_) nearly destroyed by their depredations. The eggs  are three or four in number.\"    From the plains I have very few notes. I transcribe a few of my own.    \"On the 11th March, near Oreyah, I found a nest of a Corby--good large  stick nest, built with tamarind twigs, and placed fully 40 feet from  the ground in the fork of a mango-tree standing by itself. The nest  measured quite 18 inches in diameter and five in thickness. It was a  nearly flat platform with a central depression 8 inches in diameter,  and not more than 2 deep, but there was a solid pad of horsehair more  than an inch thick below this. I took the mass out; it must have  weighed half a pound. Four eggs much incubated.    \"_Etawah, 14th March_.--Another nest at the top of one of the huge  tamarind-trees behind the Asthul: could not get up to it. A boy  brought the nest down; it was not above a foot across, and perhaps 3  inches deep; cavity about 6 inches in diameter, thickly lined with  grass-roots, inside which again was a coating of horsehair perhaps a  rupee in thickness; nest swarming with vermin. Eggs five, quite fresh;  four eggs normal; one quite round, a pure pale slightly greenish  blue, with only a few very minute spots and specks of brown having a  tendency to form a feeble zone round the large end. Measures only 1.25  by 1.2. Neither in shape, size, nor colour is it like a Corby's egg;  but it is not a Koel's, or that of any of our parasitic Cuckoos, and  I have seen at home similar pale eggs of the Rook, Hooded Crow,  Carrion-Crow, and Raven.    \"_Bareilly, May 10th_.--Three fresh eggs in large nest on a  mango-tree. Nest as usual, but lined with an immense quantity of  horsehair. We brought this home and weighed it; it weighed six ounces,  and horsehair is very light.\"    Major C.T. Bingham writes:--    \"This Crow, so common at Allahabad, is very scarce here at Delhi. In  fact I have only seen one pair.    \"At Allahabad it lays in February and March. I have, however, only  found one nest, a rather loose structure of twigs and a few thick  branches with rather a deep depression in the centre. It was placed on  the very crown of a high toddy palm (_Borassus flabelliformis_) and  was unlined save for a wad of human hair, on which the eggs, two in  number, lay; these I found hard-set (on the 13th March); in colour  they were a pale greenish blue, boldly blotched, spotted, and speckled  with brown.\"    Colonel Butler has furnished me with the following note on the  breeding of the Jungle-Crow:--    \"Belgaum, 12th March, 1880.--A nest containing four fresh eggs. It  consisted of a loose structure of sticks lined with hair and leaves,  and was placed at the top of and in the centre of a green-foliaged  tree in a well-concealed situation about 30 feet from the ground. 18th  March: Two nests, each containing three slightly incubated eggs; one  of the nests was quite low down in the centre of an 'arbor vitae'  about 12 feet from the ground. 31st March: Another nest containing  four slightly incubated eggs. Some of the latter nests were very  solidly built, and not so well Concealed. 11th April: Two more  nests, containing five incubated and three slightly incubated eggs  respectively; and on the 14th "]]]
