The other  nobles were men of about the same age as De Burg, and although the  latter's page from time to time carried round wine the goblets were  rarely emptied.    Certain topics were touched upon only to be dropped at once, and  Wulf saw that subjects upon which there was any disagreement among  them were carefully avoided.    When the boys returned to their tent Wulf said, \"Their talk reminds  me of the evenings I spent with the prior, his almoner, and two or  three other monks, rather than of those at the houses of Saxon  thanes.\"    Beorn nodded. \"I am not so much against our customs of feasting and  merriment as you are, Wulf, and should not care to spend my evenings  often in listening to such grave talk, but truly these Norman barons  and knights are far more courteous in their speech than our own  thanes, and seem to care but little for the wine cup. I admit that  such men must be far wiser advisers for a king than are our Saxons,  saving of course Harold and his brothers.\"    \"The Normans are not all so abstemious as my father and those you  saw with him,\" Guy laughed. \"Listen. You can hear songs and loud  laughter from many of the tents, ay, and might hear quarrels too  did you listen long enough. But those you saw were all men high in  the confidence of the duke. They have fought together under his  banner in many a field, and are all powerful barons. They are content  to hold their own, and have nothing to gain at the expense of others.  Their value is well established, and I believe that all of them  would be well pleased were they never called upon to set lance in  rest again. Methinks this evening they avoided all public questions  chiefly because we were present; and you see no word was spoken of  the unexpected accident that has thrown Harold on our shores,  although it must have been in all their minds; and doubtless they  talked it over as they rode hither to-day. I should not be surprised  if my father had us in his tent for the very reason that your being  there would prevent more being said about it. I do not suppose any  of them know exactly what is in the duke's mind--possibly he has  not even made it up himself; and it is assuredly wise here in  Normandy to express no strong opinion until the duke's own mind is  manifest.\"    \"I daresay you are right, Guy. I rather wondered why your father  had asked us as well as you to his tent when he had others with  him; but it is like enough that he thought our presence would prevent  any discussion on delicate topics.\"    The next morning the cavalcade mounted early, and in the afternoon  rode into the fortress of Eu. It stood upon the river Bresle, and  had, previous to the conquest of Ponthieu, been the frontier guard  of Normandy on the north. It lay only some ten miles from the spot  where the Saxon galley had been wrecked. A messenger had arrived  there early in the day from Fitz-Osberne saying that Conrad of  Ponthieu had assented to the demand of the duke for the surrender  of his captives, that these had been at once released from their  confinement, and were now honourably entertained. They would start  on the following morning from Beaurain, and would be accompanied  by Conrad, who desired to come to Eu to pay his respects to the  duke.    Although it had been certain that Conrad would not venture to refuse  the command of his powerful over-lord, Wulf and Beorn were greatly  delighted to hear that Harold and his companions had at once been  released from their imprisonment, and that they would so speedily  arrive at Eu. In the afternoon of the following day a messenger  arrived stating that the cavalcade was but an hour's ride away, and  preparations were at once made to receive it with all honour. The  garrison of the castle in their bravest attire lined the courtyard,  hangings brought from Rouen were disposed round the walls of the  great hall, two chairs of state were placed on the dais, the  men-at-arms who had come from Rouen were drawn up on either side  of the great entrance, and here William with his nobles assembled  when the cavalcade approached the castle.    The procession was headed by the Norman men-at-arms of Fitz-Osberne  and Warren. After them rode Conrad of Ponthieu with Harold by his  side. Both carried hawks on their wrists, and were, apparently, on  the most amiable terms. Behind them rode Harold's brother and nephew  and the two Norman barons; they were followed by the Saxon thanes  and the officers of the count's household. Behind these came on  foot the Saxons of inferior degree who had been left at St. Valery,  and who had by Conrad's orders been sent to join the cavalcade where  it crossed the Somme at Abbeville; the procession was closed by a  strong body of the count's men-at-arms. They rode through the double  line of spearmen until they reached the entrance. Then as Harold  dismounted, the duke descended the steps and embraced him with the  warmest expressions of satisfaction at thus meeting the most  illustrious of Englishmen.    Harold replied in suitable terms, and the duke then turned to Conrad  and thanked him warmly for having acceded to his request.    Ponthieu was but newly conquered, and might yet be a thorn in the  side of Normandy in the event of a renewal of war with France. It  was therefore to William's interest to treat Conrad's obedience to  his orders as if it had been a voluntary submission, and to ignore  his discourteous treatment of his captives. In order to eradicate  all sense of injury on the part of his vassal, he not only paid him  the ransom for Harold but gave him a considerable grant of territory.  The duke now presented his nobles and principal officers to Harold,  and then with his arm placed familiarly on his guest's shoulder led  him into the hall, and placed him in the chair of state beside his  own, other seats being placed for Wulfnoth and Hakon and for some  of the principal Norman barons, while the rest mingled with the  Saxon thanes in the body of the hall. As soon as the reception was  over Wulf hurried out into the courtyard to speak to Osgod.    \"Right glad am I to see you again, Osgod; I have been troubled as  to how you were faring.\"    \"In truth we have fared badly enough, master; we have been working  like beasts of burden, without having food that would suffice for  an ass. However, it was not for long, and will do us no harm, though  there are more than one of those fellows at St. Valery with whom I  would gladly have ten minutes play with cudgel or quarter-staff.  You may guess how surprised we were yesterday evening when we were  suddenly called out from the shed where we were sleeping, and with  many professions of regret and apology for our treatment conducted  to better quarters, where a good honest meal was set before us, and  we were then told that the duke himself had just arrived at Eu, and  that Harold and all his following were there to be given up to him.  We had fresh rushes for our beds, and a hearty breakfast this  morning, and were then placed in boats and taken up to Abbeville.  We had been there but an hour when the earl arrived with the thanes,  and glad were we, as you may imagine, to see his face again. They  stopped there for an hour to rest their steeds and to dine, and  then we marched hither as you saw. I had missed you and Beorn from  Harold's party, and made shift to approach the earl and humbly ask  him what had become of you. 'No harm has befallen your master and  his friend, good fellow,' the earl said. 'They have indeed done me  good service, for they made their escape from Beaurain and carried  the news of our detention to Duke William, and it is thus that we  have all obtained our liberty.' You seem to have fared bravely,  Wulf, judging from your attire.\"    \"Yes, we were in sore plight when we arrived at Rouen, but the duke  saw that we were provided with clothes and with horses for our  journey here.\"    At this moment an attendant came out from the hall and informed  Wulf that the duke desired speech with him. Beorn was already at  the entrance, and they were conducted on to the dais.    \"Here are your two pages,\" the duke said to Harold. \"I hold myself  to be greatly their debtor for having carried me the news that has  brought about this meeting, and given me the pleasure of having you  as my guest. They are faithful lads and quick-witted, for no men  could have carried out the mission better or more promptly than  they did.\"    \"Still more am I indebted to them,\" Harold said as he held out his  hand to the two lads, who bent on one knee while they kissed it.  \"I knew not of their going until I learnt from your barons that  they had reached Rouen with the news. They are wards of mine, and  although at one time my pages they have ceased to be so for more  than a year, and have both been down upon their estates learning  the duties of their station, which I deemed better for them than  wasting their time and getting into mischief at court.\"    The duke nodded. \"The result shows that your course was a wise one.  At court youths learn but little good. The atmosphere is not healthy  for men still less for boys, and these youths will shortly be of  an age when they will be fit to render men's service, as indeed  they have already done.\" The lads now retired from the dais.    \"It has been a fortunate week's work for us,\" Beorn said. \"We have  obtained the freedom of our lord and have gained his approbation  and that of Duke William; though, indeed, it matters not greatly  as to the duke.\"    \"I don't know, Beorn; one cannot look into the future, and there  is no saying what may happen. Anyhow, even now it may be of advantage  to us. Honourably as the duke is treating Harold, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],[0,"Milton (#20)"],[1," one whose vision is perfect. This is the only  point in which I am, against my will, a hypocrite.\" The vindication  appears again in Sonnet xix. \"These eyes, though clear To outward view  of blemish or of spot.\" In later years, when the exordium of Book  iii. of _Paradise Lost_ was composed, in the pathetic story of  his blindness, this little touch of vanity has disappeared, as  incompatible with the solemn dignity of the occasion.          CHAPTER X.    MILTON AND MORUS--THE SECOND DEFENCE--THE DEFENCE FOR HIMSELF.      Civil history is largely a history of wars between states, and  literary history is no less the record of quarrels in print between  jealous authors. Poets and artists, more susceptible than practical  men, seem to live a life of perpetual wrangle. The history of these  petty feuds is not healthy intellectual food, it is at best amusing  scandal. But these quarrels of authors do not degrade the authors in  our eyes, they only show them to be, what we knew, as vain, irritable,  and opinionative as other men. Ben Jonson, Dryden, Pope, Voltaire,  Rousseau, belabour their enemies, and we see nothing incongruous in  their doing so. It is not so when the awful majesty of Milton descends  from the empyrean throne of contemplation to use the language of the  gutter or the fish-market. The bathos is unthinkable. The universal  intellect of Bacon shrank to the paltry pursuit of place. The  disproportion between the intellectual capaciousness and the moral  aim jars upon the sense of fitness, and the name of Bacon, \"wisest,  meanest,\" has passed into a proverb. Milton's fall is far worse. It is  not here a union of grasp of mind with an ignoble ambition, but the  plunge of the moral nature itself from the highest heights to that  despicable region of vulgar scurrility and libel, which is below the  level of average gentility and education. The name of Milton is a  synonym for sublimity. He has endowed our language with the loftiest  and noblest poetry it possesses, and the same man is found employing  speech for the most unworthy purpose to which it can be put, that of  defaming and vilifying a personal enemy, and an enemy so mean that  barely to have been mentioned by Milton had been an honour to him. In  Salmasius, Milton had at least been measuring his Latin against the  Latin of the first classicist of the age. In Alexander Morus he  wreaked august periods of Roman eloquence upon a vagabond preacher, of  chance fortunes and tarnished reputation, a _graeculus esuriens_,  who appeared against Milton by the turn of accidents, and not as the  representative of the opposite principle. In crushing Morus, Milton  could not beguile himself with the idea that he was serving a cause.    In 1652 our country began to reap the fruits of the costly efforts it  had made to obtain good government. A central authority was at last  established, stronger than any which had existed since Elisabeth,  and one which extended over Scotland and Ireland, no less than over  England. The ecclesiastical and dynastic aims of the Stuart monarchy  had been replaced by a national policy, in which the interests of  the people of Great Britain sprang to the first place. The immediate  consequence of this union of vigour and patriotism, in the government,  was the self-assertion of England as a commercial, and therefore as a  naval power. This awakened spirit of conscious strength meant war with  the Dutch, who while England was pursuing ecclesiastical ends, had  possessed themselves of the trade of the world. War accordingly broke  out early in 1652. Even before it came to real fighting, the war of  pamphlets had recommenced. The prohibition of Salmasius' _Defensio  regia_ annulled itself as a matter of course, and Salmasius was free  to prepare a second _Defensio_ in answer to Milton. For the most  vulnerable point of the new English Commonwealth, was through the  odium excited on the continent against regicide. And the quarter  from which the monarchical pamphlets were hurled against the English  republic, was the press of the republic of the United Provinces,  the country which had set the first example of successful rebellion  against its lawful prince.    Before Salmasius' reply was ready, there was launched from the Hague,  in March, 1652, a virulent royalist piece in Latin, under the title of  _Regii sanguinis clamor ad coelum_ (Cry of the King's blood to Heaven  against the English parricides). Its 160 pages contained the  usual royalist invective in a rather common style of hyperbolical  declamation, such as that \"in comparison of the execution of Charles  I., the guilt of the Jews in crucifying Christ was as nothing.\"  Exaggerated praises of Salmasius were followed by scurrilous and rabid  abuse of Milton. In the style of the most shameless Jesuit lampoon,  the _Amphitheatrum_ or the _Scaliger hypobolimaeus_, and with Jesuit  tactics, every odious crime is imputed to the object of the satire,  without regard to truth or probability. Exiles are proverbially  credulous, and it is likely enough that the gossip of the English  refugees at the Hague was much employed in improving or inventing  stories about the man, who had dared to answer the royalist champion  in Latin as good as his own. Salmasius in his _Defensio_ had employed  these stories, distorting the events of Milton's life to discredit  him. But for the author of the _Clamor_ there was no such excuse, for  the book was composed in England, by an author living in Oxford and  London, who had every opportunity for informing himself accurately of  the facts about Milton's life and conversation. He chose rather to  heap up at random the traditional vocabulary of defamation, which the  Catholic theologians had employed for some generations past, as their  best weapon against their adversaries. In these infamous productions,  hatched by celibate pedants in the foul atmosphere of the Jesuit  colleges, the gamut of charges always ranges from bad grammar to  unnatural crime. The only circumstance which can be alleged in  mitigation of the excesses of the _Regii sanguinis clamor_ is that  Milton had provoked the onfall by his own violence. He who throws dirt  must expect that dirt will be thrown back at him, and when it comes to  mud-throwing, the blackguard has, as it is right that he should have,  the best of it.    The author of the _Clamor_ was Peter Du Moulin, a son of the  celebrated French Calvinist preacher of the same name. The author not  daring to entrust his pamphlet to an English press, had sent it over  to Holland, where it was printed under the supervision of Alexander  Morus. This Morus (More or Moir) was of Scottish parentage, but born  (1616) at Castres, where his father was principal of the Protestant  college. Morus fitted the _Clamor_ with a preface, in which Milton was  further reviled, and styled a \"monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens,  cui lumen ademtum.\" The secret of the authorship was strictly kept,  and Morus having been known to be concerned in the publication, was  soon transformed in public belief into the author. So it was reported  to Milton, and so Milton believed. He nursed his wrath, and took  two years to meditate his blow. He caused inquiries to be made into  Morus's antecedents. It happened that Morus's conduct had been wanting  in discretion, especially in his relations with women. He had been  equally imprudent in his utterances on some of the certainties of  Calvinistic divinity. It was easy to collect any amount of evidence  under both these heads. The system of kirk discipline offered a  ready-made machinery of espionage and delation. The standing jest of  the fifteenth century on the \"governante\" of the curé was replaced, in  Calvinistic countries, by the anxiety of every minister to detect his  brother minister in any intimacy upon which a scandalous construction  could be put.    Morus endeavoured, through every channel at his command, to convince  Milton that he was not the author of the _Clamor_. He could have saved  himself by revealing the real author, who was lurking all the while  close to Milton's elbow, and whose safety depended on Morus' silence.  This high-minded respect for another's secret is more to Morus'  honour, than any of the petty gossip about him is to his discredit.  He had nothing to offer, therefore, but negative assurances, and mere  denial weighed nothing with Milton, who was fully convinced that Morus  lied from terror. Milton's _Defensio Secunda_ came out in May, 1654.  In this piece (written in Latin) Morus is throughout assumed to be the  author of the _Clamor_, and as such is pursued through many pages in  a strain of invective, in which banter is mingled with ferocity. The  Hague tittle-tattle about Morus's love-affairs is set forth in the  pomp of Milton's loftiest Latin. Sonorous periods could hardly be more  disproportioned to their material content. To have kissed a girl is  painted as the blackest of crimes. The sublime and the ridiculous are  here blended without the step between. Milton descends even to abuse  the publisher, Vlac, who had officially signed his name to Morus's  preface. The mixture of fanatical choler and grotesque jocularity, in  which he rolls forth his charges of incontinence against Morus, and of  petty knavery against Vlac, is only saved from being unseemly by being  ridiculous. The comedy is complete when we remember that Morus had not  written the _Clamor_, nor Vlac the preface. Milton's rage blinded him;  he is mad Ajax castigating innocent sheep instead of Achsaeans.    The Latin pamphlets are indispensable to a knowledge of Milton's  disposition. We see in them his grand disdain of his opponents,  reproducing the concentrated intellectual scorn of the Latin Persius;  his certainty of the absolute justice of his own cause, and the purity  of his own motives. This lofty cast of thought is combined with an  eagerness to answer the meanest taunts. The"]]]
