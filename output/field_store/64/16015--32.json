Naturalists have maintained many divergent opinions: an idiot, an  early German, a Cossack, a European of various other nationalities, a  Mongolian, a primitive ape-man, an ancestor of modern man, and an  impossible ancestor of man. Not very reliable evidence to support the  stupendous scheme of evolution!    Now these four finds are the weak props supporting the desperate claim  of the brute origin of man. Dr.  Chapin says (Social Evolution,  p. 68): \"Other skulls and bone parts of prehistoric man have been  found, and preserved in museums, but the specimens described (the four  above mentioned) are sufficient to illustrate _the type of  evidence_ they constitute.\" The later finds measuring close to  normal capacity, doubtless are the bones of the descendants of  Adam. Even by the admission of this text-book author, the evidence  from other remains is no more convincing than that from these four  types.    Some evolutionists say that the pithecanthropus, the Heidelberg man,  the Piltdown man, and the Neanderthal man, form an unbroken line of  descent from the ape, each in turn becoming less like the ape, and  more like man. Others claim that the pithecanthropus was the end of a  special branch of the apes; the Heidelberg man the last of another  extinct branch; the Piltdown man and the Neanderthal man, likewise the  last of other extinct species. In this case, all four finds have no  evidential value whatever. All these confusing guesses from evidence  so scant and uncertain, stamp evolution a \"science falsely so called.\"    If these branches, species, or races of ape-like creatures ended, as  claimed, in the age to which these alleged remains belonged, they  could not have been the ancestors of the human race, and these alleged  links were not links at all. Some evolutionists say that the  Neanderthal race became extinct 25,000 years ago. If so, they were not  our ancestors. We are curious to know what caused the extinction of  all these races. Prof. R. S. Lull confesses, \"However we account for  it, the fact remains that ancient men are _rare_.\" Most unbiased  students would say such men never existed. The entire absence of human  remains during the 750,000 years and more is a demonstration against  the brute origin of man, and a proof of special creation.    It will be remembered that there is no complete skeleton among all the  remains, nor enough parts to make one altogether, nor to make any  large part of a skeleton,--not even an entire skull. What bones are  found are not joined together, and some of them scattered so widely  apart, that no one can be certain they belong to the same  individual. Some of the bones belong to an ape, and some to  man,--doubtless modern man. Ardent evolutionists, with a zeal worthy  of a better cause, have taken a fractional bone of a man, and a bone  of an ape, and fashioned a composite being, and called it an ape-man,  and their ancestor.    Every one of these finds is disputed by scientists, and even by  evolutionists. And all these doubtful relics would not fill a small  market basket. Yet some are ready to say that evolution is no longer a  guess or a theory, but a proven fact. Text books like Chapin's Social  Evolution are placed in the hands of pupils giving only the arguments  in favor, and the student, even if disposed to question this flimsy  and unsupported theory, is helpless in the hands of an adroit  professor. Dr. Gruenberg's high school text book teaches that man is  descended from the pithecanthropus, the Heidelberg, the Piltdown and  the Neanderthal man, without the slightest intimation that such  descent is at all disputed or questioned. What right has anyone to  teach this false and unproved theory as the truth?        30. CONFESSED COLLAPSE OF \"PROOF\"      The claim that the pithecanthropus, the Heidelberg man, the Piltdown  man, and the Neanderthal man, were the ancestors of man, collapses  under the admissions of evolutionists themselves. The eminent Wassman  says: \"There are numerous fossils of apes, the remains of which are  buried in the various strata from the lower Eocene to the close of the  alluvial epoch, but _not one connecting link_ has been found  between their hypothetical ancestral forms and man at the present  time. The whole hypothetical pedigree of man is _not supported by a  single fossil genus or a single fossil species_\" (all italics  ours).  Darwin says: \"When we descend to details, _we can prove that  not one species has changed_.\" How, then, can man be descended from  the brute?    Even H. G. Wells, who seems ready to endorse the most extravagant  views, says (Outline of History, p.  69), \"We can not say that it (the  pithecanthropus) is a direct human ancestor.\" On p. 116, is a \"Diagram  of the Relationship of Human Races,\" showing that neither the  pithecanthropus, the Heidelberg man, the Piltdown man, nor the  Neanderthal man, could have been an ancestor of the human race,  because each were the last of their species, and therefore had no  descendants.    Dr. Keith, a London evolutionist, says that the Piltdown man is not an  ancestor of man, much less an intermediate between the Heidelberg man  and the Neanderthal man. Sir Ray Lancaster confesses he is \"baffled  and stumped\" as to the Piltdown man. Dr. Keith says the \"Neanderthal  man was not quite of our species.\"    Dr. Osborn says that the Heidelberg man \"shows no trace of being  intermediate between man and the anthropoid ape.\" Again, speaking of  the teeth of the St. Brelade man, Dr. Osborn says, \"This special  feature alone would exclude the Neanderthals from the ancestry of the  higher races.\"    Prof. R. S. Lull says, \"Certain authorities have tried to prove that  the pithecanthropus is nothing but a large gibbon, but the weight of  authority considers it prehuman, though not in the line of direct  development in humanity.\"    Prof. Cope, a distinguished anatomist, says, \"The femur [of the  pithecanthropus] is that of a man, it is in no sense a connecting  link.\"    In his \"Men of the Old Stone Age,\" Dr. Osborn puts the  pithecanthropus, the Heidelberg man, the Piltdown man, and the  Neanderthal man, on limbs which _terminate abruptly as extinct  races_. They can, in no sense, then, be the ancestors of man, or  connecting links. Why, then, do they cling so desperately to these  alleged proofs, when they admit they have no evidential value? Only  sheer desperation, just as a drowning man will clutch a straw.    Dr. W. E. Orchard says: \"The remains bearing on this issue, which have  been found are very few, and their _significance is hotly disputed  by scientists themselves,--both their age, and whether they are human  or animal, or mere abnormalities_.\"    Since these four creatures (of the evolutionists) can not be the  ancestors of the human race, where are their descendants?  Evolutionists are obliged to say they were the last of their  kind. Strange! But there is no other way of escape.    Prof. Bronco, of the Geological and Palaeontological Institute of  Berlin University, says, \"_Man appeared suddenly in the Quaternary  period. Palaeontology tells us nothing on the subject,--it knows  nothing of the ancestors of man_.\"    As fossils must be imbedded in rock, there is not a single fossil of  an ape-man in the world.        31. PICTURES IN CAVERNS      To bolster up the hypothesis, that some of the scraps of bones  belonged to ape-men; who lived about 50,000 years ago, we are told  that, in many caverns there are paintings of animals, some of which  are extinct, proving that the artists were ape-men of advancing  intellect, living in that day. These drawings are rude, and inexact,  and the resemblance to extinct animals rather fanciful.  If the writer  were to try to draw a picture of a horse on the stone walls of a dark  cavern, with no light, it would be just as likely to resemble an  extinct animal, or possibly an animal that never did live and never  will.  Many of the paintings are found in the depths of unlit caverns,  often difficult of access. How could they paint any picture in the  dark, when even fire was unknown, and the torch and lamp-wick had not  yet been invented?  And how could they make a ladder, or erect  scaffolding of any sort in that rude age, before there were inventions  of any kind? Yet they tell us that the frescoes on the ceiling of the  dark cavern of Altamira, Spain, were made 25,000 to 50,000 years ago,  when fire was unknown, and they ask us to believe that several colors  are used, brown, red, black, yellow, and white; and that these  drawings and colors have remained undisturbed and unchanged through  these long ages. Is it easier to believe this, than to believe that  these drawings were made by modern man, using modern inventions? A  theory left to such support, must be poverty-stricken in argument  indeed.        32. VESTIGIAL ORGANS      The claim is made that the so-called rudimentary organs in the human  body such as the appendix, are the remnants of more complete organs  inherited from our animal ancestors. It is a strange argument that a  once complete and useful organ in our alleged animal ancestors, when  it becomes atrophied in man, causes such an improvement and advance,  as to cause man to survive, when his ancestors with more perfect  organs became extinct.  Man with less perfect organs became the  dominant species. If the perfect organ were better than the  rudimentary organ, how can man be the \"survival of the fittest\"? If  rudimentary organs are a proof of descent from animals with more  extensive, if not more perfect, organs, then both man and monkeys must  be descended from the rat, which has the longest proportionate  appendix of all. If unused muscles speak of our ancestry, the horse  has the strongest claim to be our ancestor.    But many organs, such as \"the thyroid gland, the thymus gland, and the  pineal gland,\" formerly classified"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#20)"],[1,"trial, scientific, religious,  associations. There are political parties with differing aims, social  sets, cliques, gangs, corporations, partnerships, groups bound closely  together by ties of blood, and so on in endless variety. In many modern  states and in some ancient, there is great diversity of populations,  of varying languages, religions, moral codes, and traditions. From this  standpoint, many a minor political unit, one of our large cities, for  example, is a congeries of loosely associated societies, rather than an  inclusive and permeating community of action and thought. (See ante, p.  20.)    The terms society, community, are thus ambiguous. They have both a  eulogistic or normative sense, and a descriptive sense; a meaning  de jure and a meaning de facto. In social philosophy, the former  connotation is almost always uppermost. Society is conceived as one by  its very nature. The qualities which accompany this unity, praiseworthy  community of purpose and welfare, loyalty to public ends, mutuality of  sympathy, are emphasized. But when we look at the facts which the term  denotes instead of confining our attention to its intrinsic connotation,  we find not unity, but a plurality of societies, good and bad. Men  banded together in a criminal conspiracy, business aggregations that  prey upon the public while serving it, political machines held together  by the interest of plunder, are included. If it is said that such  organizations are not societies because they do not meet the ideal  requirements of the notion of society, the answer, in part, is that the  conception of society is then made so \"ideal\" as to be of no use, having  no reference to facts; and in part, that each of these organizations,  no matter how opposed to the interests of other groups, has something of  the praiseworthy qualities of \"Society\" which hold it together. There  is honor among thieves, and a band of robbers has a common interest as  respects its members. Gangs are marked by fraternal feeling, and narrow  cliques by intense loyalty to their own codes. Family life may be marked  by exclusiveness, suspicion, and jealousy as to those without, and yet  be a model of amity and mutual aid within. Any education given by a  group tends to socialize its members, but the quality and value of the  socialization depends upon the habits and aims of the group. Hence, once  more, the need of a measure for the worth of any given mode of social  life. In seeking this measure, we have to avoid two extremes. We cannot  set up, out of our heads, something we regard as an ideal society. We  must base our conception upon societies which actually exist, in order  to have any assurance that our ideal is a practicable one. But, as we  have just seen, the ideal cannot simply repeat the traits which are  actually found. The problem is to extract the desirable traits of forms  of community life which actually exist, and employ them to criticize  undesirable features and suggest improvement. Now in any social group  whatever, even in a gang of thieves, we find some interest held in  common, and we find a certain amount of interaction and cooperative  intercourse with other groups. From these two traits we derive  our standard. How numerous and varied are the interests which are  consciously shared? How full and free is the interplay with other forms  of association? If we apply these considerations to, say, a criminal  band, we find that the ties which consciously hold the members together  are few in number, reducible almost to a common interest in plunder; and  that they are of such a nature as to isolate the group from other  groups with respect to give and take of the values of life. Hence, the  education such a society gives is partial and distorted. If we take, on  the other hand, the kind of family life which illustrates the standard,  we find that there are material, intellectual, aesthetic interests in  which all participate and that the progress of one member has worth for  the experience of other members--it is readily communicable--and  that the family is not an isolated whole, but enters intimately into  relationships with business groups, with schools, with all the agencies  of culture, as well as with other similar groups, and that it plays a  due part in the political organization and in return receives support  from it. In short, there are many interests consciously communicated and  shared; and there are varied and free points of contact with other modes  of association.    I. Let us apply the first element in this criterion to a despotically  governed state. It is not true there is no common interest in such an  organization between governed and governors. The authorities in command  must make some appeal to the native activities of the subjects, must  call some of their powers into play. Talleyrand said that a government  could do everything with bayonets except sit on them. This cynical  declaration is at least a recognition that the bond of union is  not merely one of coercive force. It may be said, however, that the  activities appealed to are themselves unworthy and degrading--that such  a government calls into functioning activity simply capacity for fear.  In a way, this statement is true. But it overlooks the fact that  fear need not be an undesirable factor in experience. Caution,  circumspection, prudence, desire to foresee future events so as to avert  what is harmful, these desirable traits are as much a product of calling  the impulse of fear into play as is cowardice and abject submission. The  real difficulty is that the appeal to fear is isolated. In evoking dread  and hope of specific tangible reward--say comfort and ease--many other  capacities are left untouched. Or rather, they are affected, but in such  a way as to pervert them. Instead of operating on their own account they  are reduced to mere servants of attaining pleasure and avoiding pain.    This is equivalent to saying that there is no extensive number of common  interests; there is no free play back and forth among the members of  the social group. Stimulation and response are exceedingly one-sided. In  order to have a large number of values in common, all the members of  the group must have an equable opportunity to receive and to take  from others. There must be a large variety of shared undertakings and  experiences. Otherwise, the influences which educate some into masters,  educate others into slaves. And the experience of each party loses in  meaning, when the free interchange of varying modes of life-experience  is arrested. A separation into a privileged and a subject-class prevents  social endosmosis. The evils thereby affecting the superior class are  less material and less perceptible, but equally real. Their culture  tends to be sterile, to be turned back to feed on itself; their art  becomes a showy display and artificial; their wealth luxurious; their  knowledge overspecialized; their manners fastidious rather than humane.    Lack of the free and equitable intercourse which springs from a variety  of shared interests makes intellectual stimulation unbalanced. Diversity  of stimulation means novelty, and novelty means challenge to thought.  The more activity is restricted to a few definite lines--as it is  when there are rigid class lines preventing adequate interplay of  experiences--the more action tends to become routine on the part of the  class at a disadvantage, and capricious, aimless, and explosive on  the part of the class having the materially fortunate position. Plato  defined a slave as one who accepts from another the purposes which  control his conduct. This condition obtains even where there is no  slavery in the legal sense. It is found wherever men are engaged in  activity which is socially serviceable, but whose service they do  not understand and have no personal interest in. Much is said about  scientific management of work. It is a narrow view which restricts  the science which secures efficiency of operation to movements of the  muscles. The chief opportunity for science is the discovery of the  relations of a man to his work--including his relations to others who  take part--which will enlist his intelligent interest in what he is  doing. Efficiency in production often demands division of labor. But  it is reduced to a mechanical routine unless workers see the technical,  intellectual, and social relationships involved in what they do,  and engage in their work because of the motivation furnished by such  perceptions. The tendency to reduce such things as efficiency of  activity and scientific management to purely technical externals is  evidence of the one-sided stimulation of thought given to those in  control of industry--those who supply its aims. Because of their lack  of all-round and well-balanced social interest, there is not sufficient  stimulus for attention to the human factors and relationships in  industry. Intelligence is narrowed to the factors concerned with  technical production and marketing of goods. No doubt, a very acute and  intense intelligence in these narrow lines can be developed, but the  failure to take into account the significant social factors means none  the less an absence of mind, and a corresponding distortion of emotional  life. II. This illustration (whose point is to be extended to all  associations lacking reciprocity of interest) brings us to our second  point. The isolation and exclusiveness of a gang or clique brings its  antisocial spirit into relief. But this same spirit is found wherever  one group has interests \"of its own\" which shut it out from full  interaction with other groups, so that its prevailing purpose is the  protection of what it has got, instead of reorganization and progress  through wider relationships. It marks nations in their isolation from  one another; families which seclude their domestic concerns as if they  had no connection with a larger life;"]]]
