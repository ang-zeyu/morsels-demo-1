This  labyrinth and wilderness is not only well designed, and completely  finished, but is perfectly well kept, and the _espaliers_ filled exactly  at bottom, to the very ground, and are led up to proportioned heights on  the top, so that nothing of that kind can be more beautiful.    The house itself is every way answerable on the outside to the beautiful  prospect, and the two fronts are the largest and, beyond comparison, the  finest of the kind in England.  The great stairs go up from the second  court of the palace on the right hand, and lead you to the south  prospect.    I hinted in my last that King William brought into England the love of  fine paintings as well as that of fine gardens; and you have an example  of it in the cartoons, as they are called, being five pieces of such  paintings as, if you will believe men of nice judgment and great  travelling, are not to be matched in Europe.  The stories are known, but  especially two of them--viz., that of St. Paul preaching on Mars Hill to  the self-wise Athenians, and that of St. Peter passing sentence of death  on Ananias--I say, these two strike the mind with the utmost surprise,  the passions are so drawn to the life; astonishment, terror, and death in  the face of Ananias, zeal and a sacred fire in the eyes of the blessed  Apostle, fright and surprise upon the countenances of the beholders in  the piece of Ananias; all these describe themselves so naturally that you  cannot but seem to discover something of the like passions, even in  seeing them.    In the other there is the boldness and courage with which St. Paul  undertook to talk to a set of men who, he knew, despised all the world,  as thinking themselves able to teach them anything.  In the audience  there is anticipating pride and conceit in some, a smile or fleer of  contempt in others, but a kind of sensible conviction, though crushed in  its beginning, on the faces of the rest; and all together appear  confounded, but have little to say, and know nothing at all of it; they  gravely put him off to hear him another time; all these are seen here in  the very dress of the face--that is, the very countenances which they  hold while they listen to the new doctrine which the Apostle preached to  a people at that time ignorant of it.    The other of the cartoons are exceeding fine but I mention these as the  particular two which are most lively, which strike the fancy the soonest  at first view.  It is reported, but with what truth I know not, that the  late French king offered an hundred thousand _louis d'ors_ for these  pictures; but this, I say, is but a report.  The king brought a great  many other fine pieces to England, and with them the love of fine  paintings so universally spread itself among the nobility and persons of  figure all over the kingdom that it is incredible what collections have  been made by English gentlemen since that time, and how all Europe has  been rummaged, as we may say, for pictures to bring over hither, where  for twenty years they yielded the purchasers, such as collected them for  sale, immense profit.  But the rates are abated since that, and we begin  to be glutted with the copies and frauds of the Dutch and Flemish  painters who have imposed grossly upon us.  But to return to the palace  of Hampton Court.  Queen Mary lived not to see it completely finished,  and her death, with the other difficulties of that reign, put a stop to  the works for some time till the king, reviving his good liking of the  place, set them to work again, and it was finished as we see it.  But I  have been assured that had the peace continued, and the king lived to  enjoy the continuance of it, his Majesty had resolved to have pulled down  all the remains of the old building (such as the chapel and the large  court within the first gate), and to have built up the whole palace after  the manner of those two fronts already done.  In these would have been an  entire set of rooms of state for the receiving and, if need had been,  lodging and entertaining any foreign prince with his retinue; also  offices for all the Secretaries of State, Lords of the Treasury, and of  Trade, to have repaired to for the despatch of such business as it might  be necessary to have done there upon the king's longer residence there  than ordinary; as also apartments for all the great officers of the  Household; so that had the house had two great squares added, as was  designed, there would have been no room to spare, or that would not have  been very well filled.  But the king's death put an end to all these  things.    Since the death of King William, Hampton Court seemed abandoned of its  patron.  They have gotten a kind of proverbial saying relating to Hampton  Court, viz., that it has been generally chosen by every other prince  since it became a house of note.  King Charles was the first that  delighted in it since Queen Elizabeth's time.  As for the reigns before,  it was but newly forfeited to the Crown, and was not made a royal house  till King Charles I., who was not only a prince that delighted in country  retirements, but knew how to make choice of them by the beauty of their  situation, the goodness of the air, &c.  He took great delight here, and,  had he lived to enjoy it in peace, had purposed to make it another thing  than it was.  But we all know what took him off from that felicity, and  all others; and this house was at last made one of his prisons by his  rebellious subjects.    His son, King Charles II., may well be said to have an aversion to the  place, for the reason just mentioned--namely, the treatment his royal  father met with there--and particularly that the rebel and murderer of  his father, Cromwell, afterwards possessed this palace, and revelled here  in the blood of the royal party, as he had done in that of his sovereign.  King Charles II. therefore chose Windsor, and bestowed a vast sum in  beautifying the castle there, and which brought it to the perfection we  see it in at this day--some few alterations excepted, done in the time of  King William.    King William (for King James is not to be named as to his choice of  retired palaces, his delight running quite another way)--I say, King  William fixed upon Hampton Court, and it was in his reign that Hampton  Court put on new clothes, and, being dressed gay and glorious, made the  figure we now see it in.    The late queen, taken up for part of her reign in her kind regards to the  prince her spouse, was obliged to reside where her care of his health  confined her, and in this case kept for the most part at Kensington,  where he died; but her Majesty always discovered her delight to be at  Windsor, where she chose the little house, as it was called, opposite to  the Castle, and took the air in her chaise in the parks and forest as she  saw occasion.    Now Hampton Court, by the like alternative, is come into request again;  and we find his present Majesty, who is a good judge too of the  pleasantness and situation of a place of that kind, has taken Hampton  Court into his favour, and has made it much his choice for the summer's  retreat of the Court, and where they may best enjoy the diversions of the  season.  When Hampton Court will find such another favourable juncture as  in King William's time, when the remainder of her ashes shall be swept  away, and her complete fabric, as designed by King William, shall be  finished, I cannot tell; but if ever that shall be, I know no palace in  Europe, Versailles excepted, which can come up to her, either for beauty  and magnificence, or for extent of building, and the ornaments attending  it.    From Hampton Court I directed my course for a journey into the south-west  part of England; and to take up my beginning where I concluded my last, I  crossed to Chertsey on the Thames, a town I mentioned before; from  whence, crossing the Black Desert, as I called it, of Bagshot Heath, I  directed my course for Hampshire or Hantshire, and particularly for  Basingstoke--that is to say, that a little before, I passed into the  great Western Road upon the heath, somewhat west of Bagshot, at a village  called Blackwater, and entered Hampshire, near Hartleroe.    Before we reach Basingstoke, we get rid of that unpleasant country which  I so often call a desert, and enter into a pleasant fertile country,  enclosed and cultivated like the rest of England; and passing a village  or two we enter Basingstoke, in the midst of woods and pastures, rich and  fertile, and the country accordingly spread with the houses of the  nobility and gentry, as in other places.  On the right hand, a little  before we come to the town, we pass at a small distance the famous  fortress, so it was then, of Basing, being a house belonging then to the  Marquis of Winchester, the great ancestor of the present family of the  Dukes of Bolton.    This house, garrisoned by a resolute band of old soldiers, was a great  curb to the rebels of the Parliament party almost through that whole war;  till it was, after a vigorous defence, yielded to the conquerors by the  inevitable fate of things at that time.  The old house is, indeed,  demolished but the successor of the family, the first Duke of Bolton, has  erected a very noble fabric in the same place, or near it, which,  however, is not equal to the magnificence which fame gives to the ancient  house, whose strength of building only, besides the outworks, withstood  the battery of cannon in several attacks, and repulsed the Roundheads  three or four times when they attempted to besiege it.  It is incredible  what booty the garrison of this place picked up, lying as they did just  on the great Western Road, where they intercepted the carriers, plundered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11498"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 601, July 9, 1887 (#3)"],[1,"termination, a considerable number of  interested spectators were attracted to the scene in Fareham Creek. The  torpedoists resorted to severe measures, but with a distinctly useful  purpose in view, having bound the ship hand and foot, so to speak, in  such a way that her name became a solecism. They exploded 95 lb. of gun  cotton 20 ft. below the water, and in contact with her double bottom.  This amount of explosive represents the full charge of the old pattern  16 in. Whiteheads; but as the hulk was, for prudential reasons, moored  close to a mud bank, and as the water was consequently much too shallow  to allow of a locomotive torpedo being set to run at the required depth,  a fixed charge was lashed fore and aft against the bottom plating of the  ship and electrically exploded from No. 95 torpedo boat.    In previous experiments this year the ironclad was attacked on the port  side, which had been specially strengthened for the occasion, and the  result was a victory for the defense. On June 13 the starboard side was  selected for attack, in order that a comparison might be instituted with  the effects produced under different conditions by a similar experiment.    Last year in the latter case the double bottom was filled with coal; and  after the charge, which was lashed against the ship in the same way, had  been exploded, it was found that the bilge keel had been shivered for a  length of 20 ft., while the lower plating had been much bulged above the  bilge keel. Four strakes of the skin plating extending up to the armor  shelf had also been forced inward and fractured where they crossed the  longitudinal frames. They had parted in the middle for a distance of 8  ft., while some of the butts had been opened so that gashes 2 in. or 3  in. wide appeared between them. The coal had been pulverized and  scattered in all directions, and other internal damage inflicted.  Nevertheless, the watertight bulkheads remained intact, and by confining  the influx of water to a single compartment so much buoyancy was  preserved that, though the ship heeled over to starboard and was maimed,  she remained afloat, and might have continued to fight her guns,  provided always that no injury had been sustained by her machinery, a  point which these experiments do not touch. Crippled, however, as she  was, it was thought at the time (and the probability was strengthened by  subsequent examination of the ship in dock) that the coal, instead of  being a protection to the double bottom, had in reality proved a source  of weakness by receiving the energy of the explosion from the outer  plating and communicating it to the inner plating, and so distributing  it throughout the submerged portions of the hulk.    The question was sufficiently important to demand an experimental  solution; hence the _raison d'etre_ of the present demonstration. The  double bottom, which is about 21/2 ft. deep, was consequently kept empty,  and the torpedo placed in immediate contact with it in such a manner  that, being overhung by the contour of the hull, the ship would feel the  full force of the upward as well as the lateral energy of the charge. On  other accounts the importance of the experiment was obvious, for,  although it had been ascertained that torpedo nets were capable of  protecting a battle ship from the bursts of the heaviest locomotive and  outrigger charges, it might happen, of course, that the nets would be  rent or displaced by shell fire or swept away by a grazing ram or even  attacked by a double torpedo, the second passing through the gashes made  by the explosion of the first in any case. It was, therefore, of urgent  necessity that the effect of a torpedo bursting in immediate contact  with a ship's bottom should be practically and clearly determined. The  charge on June 13 was fired just before 5 p.m. in the wake of the  boilers, and it was soon perceived that something of a fatal character  had taken place from the appearance of coal dust sweeping up through the  hold. The report had not the dull boom to which the spectators had  become accustomed. Instead of this, the gun cotton exploded with a  sharp, angry, whistling noise, while the manner in which the mud was  churned up showed that the force of the rebound was terrific. The ship  lifted bodily near the stern, after which it was seen to leisurely heel  over to starboard some eight or ten degrees, and finally repose, though  not until the tide fell, upon the mud. The old hulk had been mortally  wounded at last.    A complete knowledge of the disaster which has overtaken her (says the  correspondent of the London _Times_, to which we are indebted for the  above particulars) will not be obtained until a careful investigation  has been made of the hull in dock. But, from a hasty exploration which  was conducted on board, it was evident that the shot had not only  dislocated the inner plating of the double bottom, but had penetrated  the bunker compartment, stored as it was with coal, that the watertight  doors and compartments had ceased to operate, and that water was flowing  into the hull through a hundred crevices. To such an extent was this the  case that, though a strong working party was at hand ready for any  emergency, it was deemed useless to attempt to free the ship of water  until her gashes had been temporarily closed from outside. When this has  been done, she will be pumped out and brought into dock for careful  examination. From what has been said, it will be seen that while the  explosion of 95 lb. of gun cotton in actual contact last November simply  crippled the Resistance, the explosion of a like charge at the same  spot, and under approximately the same conditions, has in this instance  not simply disabled, but really sunk the ship.           *       *       *       *       *          AN ENGLISH CAR COUPLING.      The new automatic railway coupling illustrated below is the invention of  Mr. Richard Hill, and has been practically developed by Mr. B.H.  Thwaite, of Liverpool. It will be seen that the system is somewhat  similar to the parallel motion when in action.    The catch and peculiarly shaped hooks slide over the cross and catch  bars. These latter turn horizontally on a central pivot attached to the  jaw end of the drawbar. The cross catch bars adjust themselves to the  direction of the line of pull in the drawbar. The cranking of the  drawbar allows for the deflection of the buffer springs.    The arrangement of uncoupling, or throwing hooks out of gear, is  extremely simple and effective. The cranked part of the rod passing  across the end of the wagon, and with handles at each end workable from  the 6 ft. way, is attached to the catch hooks by means of a light chain.  On throwing the handle over, and against the end of the wagon, the crank  moves over and below the center, lifting up the catch into a position  out of range of action, and from this position it cannot fall except it  is released by the shunter. A shackle and links hang from the end of the  drawbar for attachment to ordinary wagons.    After a long and costly series of experiments the form of coupling shown  in illustration was adopted. Part of the experimental couplings used  were made by the Hadfield Steel Foundry Company, but the couplings used  at a recent trial at Gloucester were forged by the Gloucester Wagon  Company.    [Illustration: AN ENGLISH CAR COUPLING.]    The trial couplings were applied to old and worn-out coal wagons,  varying in relative heights and widths of buffers, and the tests were:    1. Coupling and uncoupling, and passing coupled round curves of less  than two chains radius. 2. Coupling under rapid transit movement and  violent shock. 3. Coupling under slow movement, the wagons being shunted  together by two shunters. 4. Wagons brought violently together while the  coupling hooks were lifted out of action, to test the rigidity of the  hooks in this position. 5. Tested in competition with the ordinary  coupling stock.    The trial was a success. The new automatic coupling satisfactorily  underwent the various conditions, and it was proved that: 1. It can be  lifted out of action with one hand and quite easily. 2. It can be  coupled and uncoupled six times as fast as with the pole hook in the  daytime. At night this advantage would be considerably increased.    The coupling is strong as well as elastic in its parts, and adjusts  itself to the various conditions of traction.--_Engineering_.           *       *       *       *       *    [Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 597, page 9539.]          MAGAZINE RIFLES.      _Chaffee-Reece Magazine Rifle_.--We do not insert a drawing of this  arm--one of the three selected by the American board--as it belongs to  the same class and is similar in general construction to the Hotchkiss.  There is, however, an important difference in the magazine, which has no  spiral spring, but is furnished instead with an ingenious system of  ratchet bars. One of these carries forward the cartridge a distance  equal to its own length at each reciprocal motion of the bolt, while a  second bar has no longitudinal motion, but prevents the cartridges from  moving to the rear in the magazine tube after they have been moved  forward by the other bar. The magazine is loaded through an aperture in  the butt plate, the opening of the spring cover of which causes the two  ratchet bars to be depressed, so that the magazine can be filled by  passing the cartridges along a smooth middle bar. The act of closing the  spring cover again brings the two ratchet bars into play.
