We may give what  explanation we please of this unwillingness; we may attribute it to  pride, a name which is given indiscriminately to some of the most and to  some of the least estimable feelings of which mankind are capable; we  may refer it to the love of liberty and personal independence, an appeal  to which was with the Stoics one of the most effective means for the  inculcation of it; to the love of power, or to the love of excitement,  both of which do really enter into and contribute to it: but its most  appropriate appellation is a sense of dignity, which all human beings  possess in one form or other, and in some, though by no means in exact,  proportion to their higher faculties, and which is so essential a part  of the happiness of those in whom it is strong, that nothing which  conflicts with it could be, otherwise than momentarily, an object of  desire to them. Whoever supposes that this preference takes place at a  sacrifice of happiness-that the superior being, in anything like equal  circumstances, is not happier than the inferior-confounds the two very  different ideas, of happiness, and content. It is indisputable that the  being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of  having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel  that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constituted,  is imperfect. But he can learn to bear its imperfections, if they are at  all bearable; and they will not make him envy the being who is indeed  unconscious of the imperfections, but only because he feels not at all  the good which those imperfections qualify. It is better to be a human  being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates  dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, is of a  different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the  question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.    It may be objected, that many who are capable of the higher pleasures,  occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the  lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the  intrinsic superiority of the higher. Men often, from infirmity of  character, make their election for the nearer good, though they know it  to be the less valuable; and this no less when the choice is between two  bodily pleasures, than when it is between bodily and mental. They pursue  sensual indulgences to the injury of health, though perfectly aware that  health is the greater good. It may be further objected, that many who  begin with youthful enthusiasm for everything noble, as they advance in  years sink into indolence and selfishness. But I do not believe that  those who undergo this very common change, voluntarily choose the lower  description of pleasures in preference to the higher. I believe that  before they devote themselves exclusively to the one, they have already  become incapable of the other. Capacity for the nobler feelings is in  most natures a very tender plant, easily killed, not only by hostile  influences, but by mere want of sustenance; and in the majority of young  persons it speedily dies away if the occupations to which their position  in life has devoted them, and the society into which it has thrown them,  are not favourable to keeping that higher capacity in exercise. Men lose  their high aspirations as they lose their intellectual tastes, because  they have not time or opportunity for indulging them; and they addict  themselves to inferior pleasures, not because they deliberately prefer  them, but because they are either the only ones to which they have  access, or the only ones which they are any longer capable of enjoying.  It may be questioned whether any one who has remained equally  susceptible to both classes of pleasures, ever knowingly and calmly  preferred the lower; though many, in all ages, have broken down in an  ineffectual attempt to combine both.    From this verdict of the only competent judges, I apprehend there can be  no appeal. On a question which is the best worth having of two  pleasures, or which of two modes of existence is the most grateful to  the feelings, apart from its moral attributes and from its consequences,  the judgment of those who are qualified by knowledge of both, or, if  they differ, that of the majority among them, must be admitted as final.  And there needs be the less hesitation to accept this judgment  respecting the quality of pleasures, since there is no other tribunal to  be referred to even on the question of quantity. What means are there of  determining which is the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two  pleasurable sensations, except the general suffrage of those who are  familiar with both? Neither pains nor pleasures are homogeneous, and  pain is always heterogeneous with pleasure. What is there to decide  whether a particular pleasure is worth purchasing at the cost of a  particular pain, except the feelings and judgment of the experienced?  When, therefore, those feelings and judgment declare the pleasures  derived from the higher faculties to be preferable _in kind_, apart from  the question of intensity, to those of which the animal nature,  disjoined from the higher faculties, is susceptible, they are entitled  on this subject to the same regard.    I have dwelt on this point, as being a necessary part of a perfectly  just conception of Utility or Happiness, considered as the directive  rule of human conduct. But it is by no means an indispensable condition  to the acceptance of the utilitarian standard; for that standard is not  the agent's own greatest happiness, but the greatest amount of happiness  altogether; and if it may possibly be doubted whether a noble character  is always the happier for its nobleness, there can be no doubt that it  makes other people happier, and that the world in general is immensely a  gainer by it. Utilitarianism, therefore, could only attain its end by  the general cultivation of nobleness of character, even if each  individual were only benefited by the nobleness of others, and his own,  so far as happiness is concerned, were a sheer deduction from the  benefit. But the bare enunciation of such an absurdity as this last,  renders refutation superfluous.    According to the Greatest Happiness Principle, as above explained, the  ultimate end, with reference to and for the sake of which all other  things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that of  other people), is an existence exempt as far as possible from pain, and  as rich as possible in enjoyments, both in point of quantity and  quality; the test of quality, and the rule for measuring it against  quantity, being the preference felt by those who, in their opportunities  of experience, to which must be added their habits of self-consciousness  and self-observation, are best furnished with the means of comparison.  This, being, according to the utilitarian opinion, the end of human  action, is necessarily also the standard of morality; which may  accordingly be defined, the rules and precepts for human conduct, by the  observance of which an existence such as has been described might be, to  the greatest extent possible, secured to all mankind; and not to them  only, but, so far as the nature of things admits, to the whole sentient  creation.    Against this doctrine, however, arises another class of objectors, who  say that happiness, in any form, cannot be the rational purpose of human  life and action; because, in the first place, it is unattainable: and  they contemptuously ask, What right hast thou to be happy? a question  which Mr. Carlyle clenches by the addition, What right, a short time  ago, hadst thou even _to be_? Next, they say, that men can do _without_  happiness; that all noble human beings have felt this, and could not  have become noble but by learning the lesson of Entsagen, or  renunciation; which lesson, thoroughly learnt and submitted to, they  affirm to be the beginning and necessary condition of all virtue.    The first of these objections would go to the root of the matter were it  well founded; for if no happiness is to be had at all by human beings,  the attainment of it cannot be the end of morality, or of any rational  conduct. Though, even in that case, something might still be said for  the utilitarian theory; since utility includes not solely the pursuit of  happiness, but the prevention or mitigation of unhappiness; and if the  former aim be chimerical, there will be all the greater scope and more  imperative need for the latter, so long at least as mankind think fit to  live, and do not take refuge in the simultaneous act of suicide  recommended under certain conditions by Novalis. When, however, it is  thus positively asserted to be impossible that human life should be  happy, the assertion, if not something like a verbal quibble, is at  least an exaggeration. If by happiness be meant a continuity of highly  pleasurable excitement, it is evident enough that this is impossible. A  state of exalted pleasure lasts only moments, or in some cases, and with  some intermissions, hours or days, and is the occasional brilliant flash  of enjoyment, not its permanent and steady flame. Of this the  philosophers who have taught that happiness is the end of life were as  fully aware as those who taunt them. The happiness which they meant was  not a life of rapture, but moments of such, in an existence made up of  few and transitory pains, many and various pleasures, with a decided  predominance of the active over the passive, and having as the  foundation of the whole, not to expect more from life than it is capable  of bestowing.

Notes of a Reader           *       *       *       *       *      SUSSEX COTTAGES.      We have been delighted with the following admirable sketch of English  comfort from the pen of Mr. Cobbett:    \"I never had, that I recollect, a more pleasant journey or ride, than  this into Sussex. The weather was pleasant, the elder-trees in full  bloom, and they make a fine show; the woods just in their greatest  beauty; the grass-fields generally uncut; and the little gardens of the  labourers full of flowers; the roses and honeysuckles perfuming the air  at every cottage-door. Throughout all England these cottages and gardens  are the most interesting objects that the country presents, and they are  particularly so in Kent and Sussex. This part of these counties have the  great blessing of numerous woods: these furnish fuel, nice sweet fuel,  for the heating of ovens and for all other purposes: they afford  materials for the making of pretty pigsties, hurdles, and dead fences of  various sorts; they afford materials for making little cow-sheds; for  the sticking of peas and beans in the gardens; and for giving to every  thing a neat and substantial appearance. These gardens, and the look of  the cottages, the little flower-gardens, which you every where see, and  the beautiful hedges of thorn and of privet; these are the objects to  delight the eyes, to gladden the heart, and to fill it with gratitude  to God, and with love for the people; and, as far as my observation has  gone, they are objects to be seen in no other country in the world.  The cattle in Sussex are of a pale red colour, and very fine. I used to  think that the Devonshire were the handsomest cows and oxen, but I have  changed my mind; those of Sussex, of which I never took so much notice  before, are handsomer as well as larger; and the oxen are almost  universally used as working cattle.    \"Throughout this county I did not observe, in my late ride, one single  instance of want of neatness about a poor man's house. It is the  same with regard to the middle ranks: all is neat and beautiful, and  particularly the hedges, of which I saw the handsomest white thorn hedge  at Seddlescomb, that ever I saw in my life. It formed the inclosure of  a garden in front of a pretty good house. It was about five feet high,  about fifteen inches through; it came close to the ground, and it was  sloped a little towards the top on each side, leaving a flat about four  inches wide on the top of all. It had just been clipped; and it was as  perpendicular and as smooth as a wall: I put my eye and looked along  the sides of the several lines near the top, and if it had been built  of stone, it could not have been truer. I lament that I did not ask  the name of the owner, for it does him infinite credit. Those who see  nothing but the nasty slovenly places in which labourers live, round  London, know nothing of England. The fruit-trees are all kept in the  nicest order; every bit of paling or wall is made use of, for the  training of some sort or other. At _Lamberhurst_, which is one of  the most beautiful villages that man ever sat his eyes on, I saw what  I never saw before; namely, a _gooseberry tree trained against a  house_. The house was one of those ancient buildings, consisting of  a frame of oak wood, the internal filled up with brick, plastered over.  The tree had been planted at the foot of one of the perpendicular pieces  of wood; from the stem which, mounted up this piece of wood, were taken  side limbs to run along the horizontal pieces. There were two windows,  round the frame of each of which the limbs had been trained. The height  of the highest shoot was about ten feet from the ground, and the  horizontal shoots on each side were from eight to ten feet in length.  The tree had been judiciously pruned, and all the limbs were full of  very large gooseberries, considering the age of the fruit. This is only  one instance out of thousands that I saw of extraordinary pains taken  with the gardens.\"           *       *       *       *       *      A WINTER'S NIGHT.        How beautiful this night! The balmiest sigh    Which vernal Zephyrs breathe in evening's ear,    Were discord to the speaking quietude    That wraps this moveless scene. Heaven's ebon vault,    Studded with stars unutterably bright,    Through which the moon's unclouded grandeur rolls,    Seems like a canopy which Love had spread    To curtain her sleeping world. Yon gentle hills,    Robed in a garment of untrodden snow;    Yon darksome walls, whence icicles depend    So stainless, that their white and glittering spears    Tinge not the moon's pure beam; yon castled steep,    Whose banner hangeth o'er the time-worn tower    So idly, that wrapt Fancy deemeth it    A metaphor of Peace--all form a scene    Where musing Solitude might love to lift    Her soul above this sphere of earthliness;    Where silence undisturbed might watch alone    So cold, so bright, so still.    P.B. SHELLEY.           *       *       *       *       *      HACKNEY COACHES.      Nothing in nature or art can be so abominable as those vehicles at this  hour. We are quite satisfied that, except an Englishman, who will endure  any thing, no native of any climate under the sky would endure a London  hackney coach; that an Ashantee gentleman would scoff at it; and that  an aboriginal of New South Wales would refuse to be inhumed within its  shattered and infinite squalidness. It is true, that the vehicle has its  merits, if variety of uses can establish them. The hackney coach conveys  alike the living and the dead. It carries the dying man to the hospital,  and when doctors and tax-gatherers can tantalize no more, it carries  him to Surgeons' Hall, and qualifies him to assist the \"march of mind\"  by the section of body. If the midnight thief find his plunder too  ponderous for his hands, the hackney coach offers its services, and is  one of the most expert conveyances. Its other employments are many, and  equally meritorious, and doubtless society would find a vacuum in its  loss. Yet we cordially wish that the Maberley brain were set at work  upon this subject, and some substitute contrived. The French have  led the way, and that too by the most obvious and simple arrangement  possible. The \"_Omnibus_,\"--for they still have Latin enough in  France for the name of this travelling collection of all sorts of human  beings--the Omnibus is a long coach, carrying fifteen or eighteen  people, all inside. For two-pence halfpenny it carries the individual  the length of the Boulevard, or the whole diameter of Paris. Of those  carriages there were about half-a-dozen some months ago, and they have  been augmented since; their profits were said to have repaid the outlay  within the first year: the proprietors, among whom is Lafitte, the  banker, are making a large revenue out of Parisian sous, and speculation  is still alive.--_Monthly Mag_.           *       *       *       *       *      FRANKLIN'S GRAVE.      Captain Basil Hall, in his _Travels in North America_, just  published, says, \"On the 12th of December, we made a pilgrimage to the  tomb of Franklin--dear old Franklin! It consists of a large marble slab,  laid flat on the ground, with nothing carved upon it but these words:--      BENJAMIN AND DEBORAH    FRANKLIN.    1790.    Franklin, it will be recollected, wrote a humorous epitaph for himself;  but his good taste and good sense showed him how unsuitable to his  living character it would have been to jest in such a place. After all,  his literary works, scientific fame, and his undoubted patriotism,  form his best epitaph. Still, it may be thought, he might have been  distinguished in his own land by a more honourable resting-place than  the obscure corner of an obscure burying-ground, where his bones lie  indiscriminately along with those of ordinary mortals; and his tomb,  already wellnigh hid in the rubbish, may soon be altogether lost. One  little circumstance, however, about this spot is very striking. No  regular path has been made to the grave, which lies considerably out of  the road; but the frequent tread of visiters having pressed down the  rank grass which grows in such places, the way to the tombstone is  readily found without any guide.\"           *       *       *       *       *      AN INDIAN SULTANA IN PARIS.      It is known to very few even in France that an Indian Sultana, a  descendant of Tamerlane, named Aline of Eldir, has been living in Paris,  poor and forgotten, for above forty years. This heiress to a great  kingdom was stolen almost out of her cradle, and deserted by the robbers  on the coast of France. She was presented to the princesses of the  old court, and conceived a particular attachment for the Princess de  Lamballe; but when, at the age of only nine or ten years, her beauty  had attracted too much notice, and nothing but a _lettre de cachet_  could secure her from the persecutions of an exalted personage, she  exchanged a convent for a prison. The revolution set Aline at liberty.  At the time of the Egyptian campaign, the man who was destined to rule  France, and almost all Europe, and who had probably thus early turned  his attention to India, is said to have thought of the heiress of  Tamerlane, and to have formed the plan of restoring the illustrious  stranger to her native land.
