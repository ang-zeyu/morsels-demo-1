This task--for there was nothing better to devise--I took on  myself outright.\"    (ll. 502-514) Thus he spake; and to all the contest seemed one that  none could accomplish, and long, quiet and silent, they looked at one  another, bowed down with the calamity and their despair; but at last  Peleus spake with courageous words among all the chiefs: \"It is time  to be counselling what we shall do. Yet there is not so much profit, I  trow, in counsel as in the might of our hands. If thou then, hero son  of Aeson, art minded to yoke Aeetes' oxen, and art eager for the toil,  surely thou wilt keep thy promise and make thyself ready. But if thy  soul trusts not her prowess utterly, then neither bestir thyself nor sit  still and look round for some one else of these men. For it is not I who  will flinch, since the bitterest pain will be but death.\"    (ll. 515-522) So spake the son of Aeacus; and Telamon's soul was  stirred, and quickly he started up in eagerness; and Idas rose up  the third in his pride; and the twin sons of Tyndareus; and with them  Oeneus' son who was numbered among strong men, though even the soft down  on his cheek showed not yet; with such courage was his soul uplifted.  But the others gave way to these in silence. And straightway Argus spake  these words to those that longed for the contest:    (ll. 523-539) \"My friends, this indeed is left us at the last. But  I deem that there will come to you some timely aid from my mother.  Wherefore, eager though ye be, refrain and abide in your ship a little  longer as before, for it is better to forbear than recklessly to choose  an evil fate. There is a maiden, nurtured in the halls of Aeetes, whom  the goddess Hecate taught to handle magic herbs with exceeding skill  all that the land and flowing waters produce. With them is quenched the  blast of unwearied flame, and at once she stays the course of rivers as  they rush roaring on, and checks the stars and the paths of the sacred  moon. Of her we bethought us as we came hither along the path from the  palace, if haply my mother, her own sister, might persuade her to aid us  in the venture. And if this is pleasing to you as well, surely on  this very day will I return to the palace of Aeetes to make trial; and  perchance with some god's help shall I make the trial.\"    (ll. 540-544) Thus he spake, and the gods in their goodwill gave them  a sign. A trembling dove in her flight from a mighty hawk fell from on  high, terrified, into the lap of Aeson's son, and the hawk fell impaled  on the stern-ornament. And quickly Mopsus with prophetic words spake  among them all:    (ll. 545-554) \"For you, friends, this sign has been wrought by the  will of heaven; in no other way is it possible to interpret its meaning  better, than to seek out the maiden and entreat her with manifold skill.  And I think she will not reject our prayer, if in truth Phineus said  that our return should be with the help of the Cyprian goddess. It was  her gentle bird that escaped death; and as my heart within me foresees  according to this omen, so may it prove! But, my friends, let us call on  Cytherea to aid us, and now at once obey the counsels of Argus.\"    (ll. 555-563) He spake, and the warriors approved, remembering the  injunctions of Phineus; but all alone leapt up Apharcian Idas and  shouted loudly in terrible wrath: \"Shame on us, have we come here fellow  voyagers with women, calling on Cypris for help and not on the mighty  strength of Enyalius? And do ye look to doves and hawks to save  yourselves from contests? Away with you, take thought not for deeds of  war, but by supplication to beguile weakling girls.\"    (ll. 564-571) Such were his eager words; and of his comrades many  murmured low, but none uttered a word of answer back. And he sat down in  wrath; and at once Jason roused them and uttered his own thought: \"Let  Argus set forth from the ship, since this pleases all; but we will now  move from the river and openly fasten our hawsers to the shore. For  surely it is not fitting for us to hide any longer cowering from the  battle-cry.\"    (ll. 572-575) So he spake, and straightway sent Argus to return in  haste to the city; and they drew the anchors on board at the command of  Aeson's son, and rowed the ship close to the shore, a little away from  the back-water.    (ll. 576-608) But straightway Aeetes held an assembly of the Colchians  far aloof from his palace at a spot where they sat in times before, to  devise against the Minyae grim treachery and troubles. And he threatened  that when first the oxen should have torn in pieces the man who had  taken upon him to perform the heavy task, he would hew down the oak  grove above the wooded hill, and burn the ship and her crew, that so  they might vent forth in ruin their grievous insolence, for all their  haughty schemes. For never would he have welcomed the Aeolid Phrixus as  a guest in his halls, in spite of his sore need, Phrixus, who surpassed  all strangers in gentleness and fear of the gods, had not Zeus himself  sent Hermes his messenger down from heaven, so that he might meet with  a friendly host; much less would pirates coming to his land be let go  scatheless for long, men whose care it was to lift their hands and seize  the goods of others, and to weave secret webs of guile, and harry the  steadings of herdsmen with ill-sounding forays. And he said that besides  all that the sons of Phrixus should pay a fitting penalty to himself for  returning in consort with evildoers, that they might recklessly drive  him from his honour and his throne; for once he had heard a baleful  prophecy from his father Helios, that he must avoid the secret treachery  and schemes of his own offspring and their crafty mischief. Wherefore he  was sending them, as they desired, to the Achaean land at the bidding  of their father--a long journey. Nor had he ever so slight a fear of  his daughters, that they would form some hateful scheme, nor of his  son Apsyrtus; but this curse was being fulfilled in the children of  Chalciope. And he proclaimed terrible things in his rage against the  strangers, and loudly threatened to keep watch over the ship and its  crew, so that no one might escape calamity.    (ll. 609-615) Meantime Argus, going to Aeetes' palace, with manifold  pleading besought his mother to pray Medea's aid; and Chalciope herself  already had the same thoughts, but fear checked her soul lest haply  either fate should withstand and she should entreat her in vain, all  distraught as she would be at her father's deadly wrath, or, if Medea  yielded to her prayers, her deeds should be laid bare and open to view.    (ll. 616-635) Now a deep slumber had relieved the maiden from her  love-pains as she lay upon her couch. But straightway fearful dreams,  deceitful, such as trouble one in grief, assailed her. And she thought  that the stranger had taken on him the contest, not because he longed  to win the ram's fleece, and that he had not come on that account to  Aeetes' city, but to lead her away, his wedded wife, to his own home;  and she dreamed that herself contended with the oxen and wrought the  task with exceeding ease; and that her own parents set at naught their  promise, for it was not the maiden they had challenged to yoke the oxen  but the stranger himself; from that arose a contention of doubtful issue  between her father and the strangers; and both laid the decision  upon her, to be as she should direct in her mind. But she suddenly,  neglecting her parents, chose the stranger. And measureless anguish  seized them and they shouted out in their wrath; and with the cry sleep  released its hold upon her. Quivering with fear she started up, and  stared round the walls of her chamber, and with difficulty did she  gather her spirit within her as before, and lifted her voice aloud:    (ll. 636-644) \"Poor wretch, how have gloomy dreams affrighted me! I fear  that this voyage of the heroes will bring some great evil. My heart is  trembling for the stranger. Let him woo some Achaean girl far away among  his own folk; let maidenhood be mine and the home of my parents. Yet,  taking to myself a reckless heart, I will no more keep aloof but will  make trial of my sister to see if she will entreat me to aid in the  contest, through grief for her own sons; this would quench the bitter  pain in my heart.\"    (ll. 645-673) She spake, and rising from her bed opened the door of her  chamber, bare-footed, clad in one robe; and verily she desired to go to  her sister, and crossed the threshold. And for long she stayed there  at the entrance of her chamber, held back by shame; and she turned back  once more; and again she came forth from within, and again stole back;  and idly did her feet bear her this way and that; yea, as oft as she  went straight on, shame held her within the chamber, and though held  back by shame, bold desire kept urging her on. Thrice she made the  attempt and thrice she checked herself, the fourth time she fell on her  bed face downward, writhing in pain. And as when a bride in her chamber  bewails her youthful husband, to whom her brothers and parents have  given her, nor yet does she hold converse with all her attendants for  shame and for thinking of him; but she sits apart in her grief; and some  doom has destroyed him, before they have had pleasure of each other's  charms; and she with heart on fire silently weeps, beholding her widowed  couch, in fear lest the women should mock and revile her; like to her  did Medea lament. And suddenly as she was in the midst of her tears, one  of the handmaids came forth and noticed her, one who was her youthful  attendant; and straightway she told Chalciope, who sat in the midst of  her sons devising how to win over her sister. And when Chalciope heard  the strange tale from the handmaid, not even so did she disregard it.  And "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#20)"],[1,"her: \"Lady,\" he says, \"by the Lord, I pray you, to take some  pity on yourself! It is meet that you should mourn, but it is no use to  be disconsolate; for you may yet rise to high estate. Do not sink into  apathy, but comfort yourself; that will be wise, and God will give you  joy again. Your wondrous beauty holds good fortune in store for you; for  I will take you as my wife, and make you a countess and dame of rank:  this ought to bring you much consolation. And I shall have the body  removed and laid away with great honour. Leave off now this grief of  yours which in your frenzy you display.\" And she replies: \"Sire, begone!  For God's sake, let me be! You can accomplish nothing here. Nothing that  one could say or do could ever make me glad again.\" At this the Count  drew back and said: \"Let us make a bier, whereon to carry away this body  with the lady to the town of Limors. There the body shall be interred.  Then will I espouse the lady, whether or not she give consent: for never  did I see any one so fair, nor desire any as I do her. Happy I am to  have met with her. Now make quickly and without delay a proper bier for  this dead knight. Halt not for the trouble, nor from sloth.\" Then some  of his men draw out their swords and soon cut two saplings, upon which  they laid branches cross-wise. Upon this litter they laid Erec down;  then hitched two horses to it. Enide rides alongside, not ceasing to  make lament, and often fainting and falling back; but the horsemen hold  her tight, and try to support her with their arms, and raise her up and  comfort her. All the way to Limors they escort the body, until they come  to the palace of the Count. All the people follow up after them--ladies,  knights, and townspeople. In the middle off the hall upon a dais they  stretched the body out full length, with his lance and shield alongside.  The hall is full, the crowd is dense. Each one is anxious to inquire  what is this trouble, what marvel here. Meanwhile the Count takes  counsel with his barons privily. \"My lords,\" he says, \"upon the spot I  wish to espouse this lady here. We can plainly judge by her beauty  and prudent mien that she is of very gentle rank. Her beauty and noble  bearing show that the honour of a kingdom or empire might well be  bestowed upon her. I shall never suffer disgrace through her; rather I  think to win more honour. Have my chaplain summoned now, and do you go  and fetch the lady. The half of all my land I will give her as her dower  if she will comply with my desire.\" Then they bade the chaplain come,  in accordance with the Count's command, and the dame they brought there,  too, and made her marry him perforce; for she flatly refused to give  consent. But in spite of all, the Count married her in accordance with  his wish. And when he had married her, the constable at once had the  tables set in the palace, and had the food prepared; for already it was  time for the evening meal.    (Vv. 4779-4852.) After vespers, that day in May, Enide was in sore  distress, nor did her grief cease to trouble her. And the Count urged  her mildly by prayer and threat to make her peace and be consoled, and  he made her sit down upon a chair, though it was against her will. In  spite of her, they made her take a seat and placed the table in front of  her. The Count takes his place on the other side, almost beside himself  with rage to find that he cannot comfort her. \"Lady,\" he says, \"you must  now leave off this grief and banish it. You can have full trust in  me, that honour and riches will be yours. You must surely realise that  mourning will not revive the dead; for no one ever saw such a thing come  about. Remember now, though poor you were, that great riches are within  your reach. Once you were poor; rich now you will be. Fortune has  not been stingy toward you, in bestowing upon you the honour of being  henceforth hailed as Countess. It is true that your lord is dead. If  you grieve and lament because of this, do you think that I am surprised?  Nay. But I am giving you the best advice I know how to give. In that I  have married you, you ought to be content. Take care you do not anger  me! Eat now, as I bid you do.\" And she replies: \"Not I, my lord. In  faith, as long as I live I will neither eat nor drink unless I first  see my lord eat who is lying on yonder dais\" \"Lady, that can never be.  People will think that you are mad when you talk such great nonsense.  You will receive a poor reward if you give occasion to-day for further  reproof.\" To this she vouchsafed no reply, holding his threats in slight  esteem, and the Count strikes her upon the face. At this she shrieks,  and the barons present blame the Count. \"Hold, sire!\" they cry to the  Count; \"you ought to be ashamed of having struck this lady because she  will not eat. You have done a very ugly deed. If this lady is distressed  because of her lord whom she now sees dead, no one should say that she  is wrong.\" \"Keep silence, all.\" the Count replies; \"the dame is mine and  I am hers, and I will do with her as I please.\" At this she could not  hold her peace, but swears she will never be his. And the Count springs  up and strikes her again, and she cries out aloud. \"Ha! wretch,\" she  says, \"I care not what thou say to me, or what thou do! I fear not thy  blows, nor yet thy threats. Beat me and strike me, as thou wilt. I shall  never heed thy power so much as to do thy bidding more or less, even  were thou with thy hands fight now to snatch out my eyes or flay me  alive.\"    (Vv. 4853-4938.) In the midst of these words and disputes Erec recovered  from his swoon, like a man who awakes from sleep. No wonder that he was  amazed at the crowd of people he saw around. But great was his grief  and great his woe when he heard the voice of his wife. He stepped to the  floor from off the dais and quickly drew his sword. Wrath and the love  he bore his wife gave him courage. He runs thither where he sees her,  and strikes the Count squarely upon the head, so that he beats out  his brains and, knocking in his forehead, leaves him senseless and  speechless; his blood and brains flow out. The knights spring from the  tables, persuaded that it is the devil who had made his way among them  there. Of young or old there none remains, for all were thrown in great  dismay. Each one tries to outrun the other in beating a hasty retreat.  Soon they were all clear of the palace, and cry aloud, both weak and  strong: \"Flee, flee, here comes the corpse!\" At the door the press is  great: each one strives to make his escape, and pushes and shoves as  best he may. He who is last in the surging throng would fain get into  the foremost line. Thus they make good their escape in flight, for one  dares not stand upon another's going. Erec ran to seize his shield,  hanging it about his neck by the strap, while Enide lays hands upon the  lance. Then they step out into the courtyard. There is no one so bold as  to offer resistance; for they did not believe it could be a man who had  thus expelled them, but a devil or some enemy who had entered the  dead body. Erec pursues them as they flee, and finds outside in  the castle-yard a stable-boy in the act of leading his steed to the  watering-place, all equipped with bridle and saddle. This chance  encounter pleased Erec well: as he steps up quickly to the horse, the  boy in fear straightway yields him up. Erec takes his seat between the  saddle-bows, while Enide, seizing the stirrup, springs up on to the  horse's neck, as Erec, who bade her mount, commanded and instructed her  to do. The horse bears them both away; and finding open the town gate,  they make their escape without detention. In the town there was great  anxiety about the Count who had been killed; but there is no one,  however brave, who follows Erec to take revenge. At his table the Count  was slain; while Erec, who bears his wife away, embraces and kisses and  gives her cheer. In his arms he clasps her against his heart, and  says: \"Sweet sister mine, my proof of you has been complete! Be no more  concerned in any wise, for I love you now more than ever I did before;  and I am certain and rest assured that you love me with a perfect love.  From this time on for evermore, I offer myself to do your will just as  I used to do before. And if you have spoken ill of me, I pardon you  and call you quit of both the offence and the word you spoke.\" Then he  kisses her again and clasps her tight. Now Enide is not ill at ease when  her lord clasps and kisses her and tells her again that he loves her  still. Rapidly through the night they ride, and they are very glad that  the moon shines bright.    (Vv. 4939-5058.) Meanwhile, the news has travelled fast, and there is  nothing else so quick. The news had reached Guivret the Little that a  knight wounded with arms had been found dead in the forest, and that  with him was a lady making moan, and so wondrous fair that Iseut would  have seemed her waiting-maid. Count Oringle of Limors had found them  both, and had caused the corpse to be borne away, and wished himself to  espouse the lady; but she refused him. When Guivret heard this news,  he was by no means pleased; for at once the thought of Erec occurred to  him. It came into his heart and mind to go and seek out the lady, and  to have the body honourably interred, if it should turn out to be he.  He assembled a thousand men-at-arms and knights to take the town. If the  Count would not surrender of his own accord the body and the lady, he  would put all to fire and flame. In the moonlight shining clear he led  his men on toward Limors, with helmets laced, in hauberks clad, and from  their necks the shields were hung. Thus, under arms, they all advanced  until nearly midnight, when Erec espied them. Now he expects to be  ensnared or killed or captured inevitably. He makes Enide dismount  beside a thicket-hedge. No wonder if he is dismayed. \"Lady, do you stay  here,\""]]]
