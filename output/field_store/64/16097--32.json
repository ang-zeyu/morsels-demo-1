Not long since, a couple resided in the suburbs of Madrid, named Perez  and Juana Donilla; and a happy couple they might have been, had not  Perez contracted a sad habit of drinking, which became more and more  confirmed after every draught of good wine; and such draughts were  certainly more frequent than his finances were in a state to allow.  Night after night was spent at the tavern; fairly might he be said to  _swallow_ all that he earned by his daily labour; and Juana and himself  (fortunately they had no children to maintain) must have been reduced  to absolute mendicity, but for the exemplary conduct of the former, who  contrived to support her spouse and herself upon the scanty produce of  her unwearied industry. If ever a sentiment of gratitude for undeserved  favours animated the bosom of Perez Donilla, he took, it must be  confessed, a strange method of declaring it; not only would he, upon his  return from his lawless carousals, grumble over that humble fare, the  possession of which at all he ought to have considered as scarce less  than a miracle, but, in his madness, unmerciful strappings were sure to  be the portion of his miserable wife. Poor Juana bore these cruelties  with a patience that ought to have canonized her under the title of St.  Grizzle: she could not, indeed, forbear crying out, under these frequent  and severe castigations; nor could she refrain from soliciting the aid  of three or four favourite gentlemen saints, who, little to the credit  of their gallantry and good-nature, always turned a deaf ear upon her  plaints and entreaties; not a word, however, of the inhuman conduct of  her _worser_ half did she breathe to _mortal_ ear. Neighbours, however,  have auricular organs like walls and little pitchers, tongues like  bells, and a spice of meddling and mischief in them like asses; so that  no wise person will suppose the conduct of Perez Donilla to his wife was  long a secret in Madrid. Juana had two brothers and a cousin resident in  the city--Gomez Arias, chief cook to his reverence the Canon Fernando;  Hernan Arias, head groom to Don Miguel de Corcoba, a knight of  Calatrava; and Pedro Pedrillo, a young barber-surgeon, in business for  himself. Gomez and Hernan, hearing of Juana's misfortunes, said, like  affectionate brothers. \"God help our poor sister, and may her own  relations help her also; for if _they_ do not, nobody else will, and she  certainly can't help herself.\" The like words they repeated to Pedro  Pedrillo, until he, being a sharp, handsome young fellow, and  particularly fond of showing forth his fine person and finer wit, agreed  to visit his cousin, and contrive some plan to extricate her from the  cruelty of Perez. Making himself, therefore, as fascinating as possible,  he marched directly to the house, or rather cabin, of Juana Donilla, and  stood before her, smiling and watching her small, thin fingers plaitting  straw for hats, some minutes ere she was aware of his presence. \"Pedro!\"  exclaimed she, with a countenance and voice of pleasure, as she  recognised the intruder.--\"Ay, _Pedro_ it is, indeed, Juana; but,  improved as _I_ am. O, mercy upon me, how black _you_ are  looking!\"--\"_Black_, cousin? Nay, then, I'm sure 'tis not for want of  washing. Come, come, Pedro, no jokes, if you please.\"--\"By St. Jago,  fair cousin, I'm as far from a joke as I am from a diploma; and my  business in this house, as in most houses, is no _jest_, I assure you.  In a word, the cries which you utter when suffering from the insane fury  of your sottish husband have reached even me, and I'm come to offer you  a little advice and assistance. No denial of the fact, Juana; those  black bruises avouch it without a tongue.\"--Juana held down her head,  colour mounted into her cheeks, tears suffused her eyes, her bosom  heaved convulsively, and for some moments she was silent from confusion,  shame, grief, and gratitude. At length, withdrawing her hand from the  affectionate grasp of Pedro, and dashing it athwart her eyes, she looked  up and said mildly, \"Thanks, many thanks, dear cousin, for your  kindness. I cannot dissemble with you; what would you have me do? I  could not _beat_ him in return; and, oh! save him from the arm of  my brothers!\"--\"What have you always done?\"--\"Borne his stripes, and  called for help upon St. Jago, St. Francis Xavier, St. Benedict, and  St. Nicholas!\"--\"And did you never invoke the three holy Maries?\"--  \"Never.\"--\"Then that's what you ought to have done,\" returned Senor  Pedrillo, with the utmost gravity. \"Now mind me,--call upon _them_  for aid next time your husband maltreats you.\"--\"Alas!\" sighed the  afflicted wife, \"_that_ will most surely be to-night. I've not much  faith in your remedy, Pedro; but may be there's no harm in trying  it.\"--\"Farewell, then, my poor, pretty, patient, black-bruised cousin,\"  cried Pedrillo; \"next time you see the _doctor_, let him know how his  remedy has sped;\" and with a comical expression of countenance, half  melancholy, half mirthful, the \"trusty and well-beloved cousin\"  departed.    Late that night, Perez Donilla entered his own habitation as intoxicated  and belligerent as ever. \"Where's my supper?\"--\"Here,\" said his wife,  trembling, as she placed before him a few heads of garlic, a piece of  salted trout, a little oil, and a crust of barley bread. \"What's all  this, woman?\" exclaimed Perez, in a voice of thunder; and with glaring  eyes and demoniacal fury he dashed the fish at her head, and the rest of  his supper upon the floor. \"Wretch! how durst _you_ fatten upon olios  and ragouts, and set trash like _this_ before your _husband?_\"--\"My  dear,\" replied Juana, meekly, \"I am starving; nothing have I tasted  since breakfast.\"--\"Don't lie, you jade! Where's the wild-fowl and the  Bologna sausage sent you by that rogue, Gomez? Stolen were they from  the canon's kitchen, and you know it! And where's the skin of excellent  Calcavella, from the Caballero's overflowing vaults? Give it to me this  _instant_, you hussy, you vixen, you--\"--\"Indeed, _indeed_,\" cried the  unfortunate wife in deep anguish, \"I take all the saints in heaven to  witness--.\"--\"That, and that, and _that_,\" interrupted the furious  tyrant, lashing her severely, according to custom, with a thick thong of  leather, and now and then adding a blow with his fist; \"let's see if  _that_ will bring me a supper fit for a Christian, and a draught of Don  Miguel's Calcavella!\" Juana remembered Pedrillo's advice, and after  roaring out more loudly than usual for aid from St. Jago, St. Francis,  St. Benedict, and St. Nicholas, shrieked at the highest pitch of her  voice, \"May the three blessed Maries help me!\" No sooner were the words  uttered, than in rushed three apparitions, arrayed in white, but so  enfolded in lined, that it was impossible to determine whether they  represented men or women; of their visages, only their eyes were  visible, peering frightfully from the white covering of their heads;  each brandished a good stout cudgel, and each, without uttering a word,  falling quick as thought upon Perez Donilla, repaid him the blows he had  lavished on his unhappy wife with such interest, as would have sealed  his fate indubitably, had not she interposed; but upon the entreaties of  that exemplary wife, the three holy Maries remitted the remainder of  their flagellation, and retired, leaving Perez senseless on the floor.  Poor Juana was agonized at beholding the state to which her graceless  partner was reduced, and hauling him, as well as her own exhausted  strength would permit, upon his miserable pallet, washed the blood and  dust from his wounds, and watched his return to consciousness with  unexampled tenderness and dutiful fidelity. Perez at length opened his  eyes, and said, in the mild voice which was natural to him when sober,  \"My poor Juana, I wish you could fetch your cousin Pedro to see me; I  think I shall die.\" Juana was half distracted at this speech; and  running to the next house, bribed a neighbour's child by the promise of  a broad-brimmed straw hat, to shade his complexion from the sun, to run  for Doctor Pedrillo. Pedro soon arrived, and was evidently more puzzled  respecting his deportment than the case of his patient. Sundry \"nods,  and becks, and wreathed smiles,\" and sundry eloquent glances of his  bright black eyes, were covertly bestowed upon his _fair_ cousin; anon,  with ludicrous solemnity, he felt the pulse of Perez, shook his head,  and, in short, imitated with inimitable exactness all the technical  airs and graces of a regular graduate of Salamanca.--\"Cousin,\" cried he  at length, with a sly look at Juana, \"I pity your plight--from my soul I  do; but your case is, I am grieved to say, desperate, unless I am  informed of the _cause_ of these monstrous weals, bruises, slashes, and  chafings, in order that my prescription, may--\"--\"The _cause_ of them,\"  said Perez, almost frightened to death, \"is, having to my cost a _saint_  of a wife.\"--\"How! that a _misfortune?_ explain yourself, my poor  fellow.\"--\"Readily,\" replied Donilla, \"if that will help to heal  me.\"--He then explained minutely the circumstances of the case,  concluding thus:--\"Not but what I am, after all, remarkably indebted to  Juana, for had she only called the eleven thousand Virgins to her  assistance, their zeal would undoubtedly have divided my body amongst  them; since, then, my wife has such friends in heaven; I shall  henceforth be careful how I enrage them again.\"--Perez Donilla kept to  his resolution, and the _Three Maries_, whom, without doubt, the  intelligent reader has recognised through their disguise, lived for many  years to rejoice in the blessed effects of a severe, but merited  infliction.

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10840"],[0,"The Explorers of Australia and their Life-work (#3)"],[1," as zealous in exploration as  he was keen in his observations, started from the newly-formed redoubt at  Rose Hill, of which he was in command, on a short excursion to examine  the surrounding country. This trip, inspired by Tench's ardent love of  discovery, became a noteworthy one in the annals of New South Wales. It  was made during the month that witnessed the discovery of the Hawkesbury  River. On the second day after his party left Rose Hill, they found  themselves early in the morning on \"the banks of a river, nearly as broad  as the Thames at Putney, and apparently of great depth, the current  running very slowly in a northerly direction.\"    This river, at first known as the Tench, was afterwards named the Nepean  by Phillip, when its identity as a tributary of the Hawkesbury had been  confirmed. Two other slight excursions were made by Tench in company with  Lieutenant Dawes, who was in charge of the Observatory, and ex-surgeon  Worgan. In May, 1791, Tench and Dawes started from Rose Hill and  confirmed the supposition that the Nepean was an affluent of the  Hawkesbury, a matter over which there had been some doubt since its first  discovery by Tench. Tench returned to England in H.M.S. Gorgon, in  December, 1791.    The names of Paterson, Johnson, Palmer, and Laing are also connected with  exploration on the upper Hawkesbury.    1.3. THE BLUE MOUNTAINS: BARALLIER.    The exploration of that portion of Australia which was accessible by the  scanty means of the early settlers was for many years impeded by the  stern barrier of the mountains, and most of their efforts in the  direction of discovery were aimed at surmounting the range that defied  their attacks. Among the many whose attempts were signalised only by  failure were the gallant Bass, whose name, for other reasons, will never  be forgotten by Australians, the quarrelsome and pragmatic Cayley, and  the adventurous Hack. Amongst them there was one, however, whose failure,  read by the light of modern knowledge, was probably a geographical  success. This was Francis Barallier, ensign in the New South Wales corps,  who was encouraged by Governor King to indulge his ardent longing for  discovery. By birth a Frenchman, Barallier had received his ensigncy by  commission on the 13th of February, 1801, having done duty as an ensign  since July, 1800, by virtue of a government general order issued by  Governor Hunter. In August, 1801, he had been appointed by Governor King  military engineer, in place of Captain Abbott resigned. In February,  1802, he was succeeded by Lieutenant George Bellasis, an artillery  officer. Besides his expeditions to the Blue Mountains, he did much  surveying with Lieutenant James Grant in the Lady Nelson. In 1804, he  went to England and saw service in several regiments, distinguishing  himself greatly in military engineering, amongst his works being the  erection of the Nelson Column in Trafalgar Square, the designer of which  was Mr. Railton. Barallier died in 1853.    Peron, the French naturalist, tells us that when in Sydney in October,  1802, he persuaded Governor King to fit out a party to attempt the  passage of the mountains, and that a young Frenchman, aide-de-camp to the  Governor, was intrusted with the leadership. He returned, however,  without having been able to penetrate further than his English  predecessors.    On the following month, however, Barallier set out from Parramatta, on  his famous embassy to the King of the Mountains. This fictitious embassy  arose from the fact that Colonel Paterson having refused Barallier the  required leave, King claimed him as his aide-de-camp, and sent him on  this embassy. Barallier started with four soldiers, five convicts, and a  waggon-load of provisions drawn by two bullocks. He crossed the Nepean  and established a depot at a place known as Nattai, whence the waggon was  sent back to Sydney for provisions, Barallier, with the remainder of his  men and a native, pushing out westwards. After this preliminary  examination he returned to the depot, and made a fresh departure on the  22nd of November, and, continuing mostly directly westwards, he reached a  point (according to his chart) about one hundred and five miles due west  from Lake Illawarra. If this position is even approximately correct, he  must have been at the very source of the Lachlan River.    I give a few extracts from his diary, which was not even translated until  the Historical Records of New South Wales were collected by Mr. F.M.  Bladen. They refer to the crossing of the range.    \"On the 24th of November, I followed the range of elevated mountains,  where I saw several kangaroos. This country is covered with meadows and  small hills, where trees grow a great distance apart...I resumed my  journey, following various directions to avoid obstacles, and at 4  o'clock I arrived on the top of a hill where I discovered that the  direction of the chain of mountains extended itself north-westerly to a  distance which I estimated to be about thirty miles, and which turned  abruptly at right angles. It formed a barrier nearly north and south,  which it was necessary to climb over...At 7 o'clock I arrived on the  summit of another hill, from where I noticed three openings: the first on  the right towards North 50 West; the other in front of me, and which  appeared very large, was west from me; and the third was South 35 West.    ...This discovery gave me great hope, and the whole of the party appeared  quite pleased, thinking that we had surmounted all difficulties, and that  we were going to enter a plain, the apparent immensity of which gave  every promise of our being able to penetrate far into the interior of the  country...At six o'clock I found myself at a distance of about two miles  from the western passage...I was then only half-a-mile from the passage,  and I sent on two men in order to discover it, instructing them to ascend  the mountain to the north of this passage...I waited till 7 o'clock for  my two men, who related to me, that after passing the range which was in  front of us we would enter an immense plain, that from the height where  they were on the mountain, they had caught sight of only a few hills  standing here and there on this plain, and that the country in front of  them had the appearance of a meadow...At daybreak I left with two men to  verify myself the configuration of the ground, and to ascertain whether  the passage of the Blue Mountains had really been effected. I climbed the  chain of mountains north of us. When I had reached the middle of this  height the view of a plain as vast as the eye could reach confirmed to me  the report of the previous day...I discovered towards the west and at a  distance which I estimated to be forty miles, a range of mountains higher  than those we had passed...From where I was, I could not detect any  obstacle to the passage right to the foot of those mountains...After  having cut a cross of St. Andrew on a tree to indicate the terminus of my  second journey, I returned by the same route I had come.\"    Barallier concludes his diary by mentioning another projected expedition  over the mountains from Jervis Bay. But no record of such a journey has  ever come to light.    [Illustration. Statue of Gregory Blaxland, Lands Office, Sydney.]    [Map. Routes of Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson (1813); Evans (1813);  Oxley (1817, 1818, 1823); and Sturt (1828 and 1829).]    1.4. THE BLUE MOUNTAINS: BLAXLAND.    Whether Barallier succeeded or not in reaching the summit of the  mountains, the verdict accepted at that date was that they had not been  passed; and until the year 1813, they were regarded as impenetrable. The  narrative of the crossing of these mountains, and the chain of events  that led up to the successful attempt is widely known, but only in a  general way. It is for this reason that a longer and more detailed  account is given in these pages; and as the expedition was successful in  opening up a way to the interior of the Continent, it is fitting that its  leader and originator, Gregory Blaxland, should be classed amongst the  makers of Australasia.    Blaxland was born in Kent, in 1771, and arrived in the colony in 1806,  accompanied by his wife and three children. He settled down to the  congenial occupation of stockbreeding, on what was then considered to be  a large scale. Finding that his stock did not thrive so well in the  immediate neighbourhood of the sea coast, and wanting more land for  pasturing his increasing herds, he made anxious enquiries in all  directions as to the possibility of crossing the Blue Mountains inland.  Nobody would entertain such a suggestion, the failures had been too many:  every one to whom he broached the subject declared it to be impossible,  prophesying that the extension of the settlement westward would forever  be obstructed by their unscalable heights. Blaxland, however, was not  intimidated by these disheartening predictions; and, in 1811, he started  out on a short journey of investigation, in company with three Europeans  and two natives. On this trip he found that by keeping on the crowning  ridge or dividing water-shed between the streams running into the Nepean  and those that fed what he then took to be an inland river, he got along  fairly well. Some time afterwards he accompanied the Governor in a boat  excursion up the Warragamba, a tributary of the Nepean, and though there  were no noteworthy results, it convinced Blaxland that, could he follow  his former tactics of adhering to the leading ridge that formed the  divide between the tributaries of the northern bank of this river and the  affluents of the Grose, a tributary of the Hawkesbury, he would attain  his object and reach the highlands. It will thus be seen that Blaxland  acted with a definite and well-thought-out mode of procedure; and that  the ridge he selected for the attempt was chosen with judgment based on  considerable"]]]
