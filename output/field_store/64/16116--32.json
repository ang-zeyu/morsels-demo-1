He told Laban, her father, that he would serve him  faithfully seven years if Rachel might be his wife, and Laban consented  to this; at the end of the seven years, however, he told Jacob that he  must first marry Leah, as she was the older, but if he would serve  another seven years he might have Rachel also. So Jacob served another  seven years for Rachel, and then they were married.    Later Esau and Jacob met and were very glad to see each other, for Jacob  had repented of his sin, and God had forgiven him; while Esau forgave  him also.    [Illustration: ISAAC BLESSING JACOB.]          THE APOSTLE PAUL.      Before his conversion to the faith of Christ, Paul was called Saul, and  he persecuted the Christians, believing that they were doing wickedly  and that he ought to punish them for it.    But while he was in the midst of these persecutions, and as he was  journeying toward Damascus one day, he saw suddenly at noon-time, a  light shining in the heavens which was greater than the light of the  sun, and he and all that were with him fell to the earth in wonder and  awe. Then Saul heard a voice speaking to him and saying, \"Saul, Saul,  why persecutest thou Me?\" And Saul said, \"Who art Thou, Lord?\" And the  voice answered, \"I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.\"    Then Saul was instructed as to what he was to do, and was told that he  would become a minister of Christ. From that time Paul preached and  taught the Christian religion, and converted many people to it.    But he was persecuted in his new work as he had persecuted others, being  finally taken prisoner and threatened with scourging; he declared  himself a Roman citizen, however, and therefore safe from such  treatment, and went on openly confessing his faith and telling of his  conversion, and he appealed for protection to the Roman emperor.    He was then put on board a ship as a prisoner to be taken to Rome. While  they were at sea a violent storm came up, and Paul warned the sailors  that they were in great danger; but they would not listen to him. At  last the ship was wrecked, all on board being cast ashore upon an  island, whither they had been carried, clinging to boards and broken  pieces of the ship.    The barbarous people of the island treated them kindly, building a fire  that they might dry their clothing and get warm; for it was cold and  they were, of course, drenched.    The men were very glad to be safe once more; but a strange thing  happened after a little: Paul gathered up an armful of sticks to put  upon the fire, and as he placed them upon the flames, a viper, which is  a kind of poisonous snake, came out of the bundle and clung to his hand;  he shook it off into the fire, however, without the slightest sign of  fear.    Those who were about him thought that the hand would swell and that  Paul would die from the effects of the bite, and they watched him  closely, believing that this trouble was sent to him as a punishment for  his sins. But no evil results came from the wound, and then the  barbarians thought he was a god and looked upon him with great respect.    Paul and the men who were with him remained upon the island for three  months. At the end of that time they went away in a ship, finally  reaching Rome, where the prisoners were given up to the authorities; but  Paul was allowed to live by himself, with only a soldier to guard him,  and after a while he called the chief men of the Jews together and told  them why he was there and preached to them the Word of God. His  preaching was received by some with faith, but others did not believe.    [Illustration: THE CRUCIFIXION.]    [Illustration: \"HE IS RISEN!\"]    Paul went on preaching and teaching in Rome for two years, living in a  house which he hired, and he brought many to Jesus. He was a man of  excellent education and a powerful preacher. His Epistles, given in the  Bible, are full of power and the fire of conviction, and he did a  wonderful work for the great cause in which he believed with all his  heart.    Paul was physically small and deformed; but mentally he was a giant. He  had been taught the knowledge of the Romans, and was therefore well  fitted to take up this new cause in a manner which would appeal to  educated people as well as to those who had no learning.    [Illustration: THE LAST SUPPER.]    [Illustration: THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST.]    From the time of his conversion until his death he labored faithfully in  the ministry of Christ, fearing no persecution or hardship when he  could do the Master's bidding and teach His holy will. The work which he  did was a wonderful work, and his influence in the Christian world has  been a very remarkable one. Brave, untiring, devoted to the cause of  Christ, he at last lost his life in that cause, adding another to the  list of martyrs whose memory the world loves and reveres.    The story of Paul's experiences reads like those tales of adventure  which are so full of absorbing interest that when once they have been  taken up, we do not feel like laying them down again until they are  finished.    This is true also of many others of the Bible stories, and great authors  have taken their themes from them for the writing of books which have  become famous.    The more we study the Bible, the more wonderful it becomes, and the more  we learn that in that marvelous book are set forth nearly all the  experiences of which human life is capable, with the teaching which each  of these experiences should bring and the lesson to be learned by the  reading of them. In all the world there is not another collection so  wonderful as this.          DAVID.      David, the son of Jesse, was a beautiful boy, who could charm by his  wonderful music. But he was to be more than a \"sweet singer,\" for  Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, declared that he should be King of  Israel, and poured the sacred oil upon his head.    Saul, who was then the King of Israel, had spells of insanity, and David  was sent for to try and calm him by his music. In this he was so  successful that after a time the king seemed to be entirely cured; so  David returned to his home, and staid there quietly until his father  sent him to the camp of the Israelites, with food for his brothers.    He found Saul's army in great commotion, because Goliath, a mighty  warrior of the Philistines, had come out before both armies and had  offered to fight any man who should be sent against him.    Goliath had a cap of brass on his head, and his body was well protected  with a covering of iron and brass, while he carried a monstrous spear  and sword, and a heavy shield. As he came before the two camps, he  cried out: \"I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we  may fight together!\"    When David came up and heard the story, he said: \"Who is this  Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?\" And David  offered to go forth against Goliath.    So he went out in his shepherd's dress, with only his staff and sling;  and Goliath, who was very angry at this, cried out: \"Am I a dog, that  thou comest against me with a staff?\" Then he began to make fun of  David. But David answered: \"Thou comest against me with a sword and a  shield; but I come against thee trusting in the Lord of Hosts, the God  of Israel, whom thou hast defied.\"    [Illustration: SAUL ANGRY WITH DAVID.]    Then, as Goliath came nearer, David took a stone from the bag at his  side, and putting it into his sling, he took good aim, and it struck  Goliath in the middle of the forehead and stunned him. As the giant  fell, David ran up to him, and taking the mighty sword, cut off his head  with it.    This act of David's brought a great victory to Saul's army, and the king  was delighted with his courage; while Jonathan, Saul's eldest son, loved  the boy from that time, and they became like brothers. David also  married the daughter of Saul, and was placed over his men of war.    [Illustration: THE DEATH OF SAUL.]    [Illustration: THE DEATH OF AHAB.]    But when all the people praised David, and Saul knew how much they  loved him, he grew jealous, and David was obliged to fly for his life  and hide himself from the king. During these wanderings, he wrote some  of his most beautiful psalms.    Saul, however, was finally killed, and at last David became king. He  ruled Israel for nearly forty years, making it a great and powerful  nation; and when he died he was buried at Jerusalem, which was called  \"The City of David,\" because he had caused it to be taken from the  enemy.          THE TOWER OF BABEL.      The sons of Noah were named Shem, Ham and Japheth. These sons in turn  became the fathers of children so that the descendants of Noah were very  numerous.    One of these descendants, named Nimrod, was a mighty hunter and a man of  power and authority in the land, and it has even been said that the  people worshiped him as a god.    In those days men liked to build high towers reaching away up toward the  heavens. Perhaps they were afraid of another flood, and perhaps they  simply wished to show what they could do; but however that may be, ruins  of towers can still be seen in various parts of the world, one of the  most noted of which is that of the \"Tower of Nimrod.\" It is forty feet  high and stands on the top of a hill near the River Euphrates in Asia.    In the time of Nimrod, the people said, \"Let us build us a city and a  tower, whose top may reach unto Heaven; and let us make us a name, lest  we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\" So they began  to build the tower, and they made it very strong indeed, and kept  raising it higher and higher toward the heavens, thinking, Jewish  tradition, or story, tells us, that they would have a shelter in which  they would be perfectly safe from any flood which might come, or any  fire. There were some of the people also who wished to use the tower as  a temple for the idols which they worshiped.

Nor am I acquainted with any one who had greater familiarity with  Michelangelo than I had, or who served him more faithfully in friendly  offices; nor do I believe that a single man could exhibit a larger  number of letters written with his own hand, or evincing greater  personal affection, than I can.\"    This contention between Condivi and Vasari, our two contemporary  authorities upon the facts of Michelangelo's life, may not seem to be  a matter of great moment for his biographer after the lapse of four  centuries. Yet the first steps in the art-career of so exceptional a  genius possess peculiar interest. It is not insignificant to  ascertain, so far as now is possible, what Michelangelo owed to his  teachers. In equity, we acknowledge that Lodovico's record on the  ledger of the Ghirlandajo brothers proves their willingness to take  him as a prentice, and their payment to him of two florins in advance;  but the same record does not disprove Condivi's statement, derived  from his old master's reminiscences, to the effect that Domenico  Ghirlandajo was in no way greatly serviceable to him as an instructor.  The fault, in all probability, did not lie with Ghirlandajo alone.  Michelangelo, as we shall have occasions in plenty to observe, was  difficult to live with; frank in speech to the point of rudeness,  ready with criticism, incapable of governing his temper, and at no  time apt to work harmoniously with fellow-craftsmen. His extraordinary  force and originality of genius made themselves felt, undoubtedly, at  the very outset of his career; and Ghirlandajo may be excused if,  without being positively jealous of the young eagle settled in his  homely nest, he failed to do the utmost for this gifted and  rough-natured child of promise. Beethoven's discontent with Haydn as a  teacher offers a parallel; and sympathetic students of psychology will  perceive that Ghirlandajo and Haydn were almost superfluous in the  training of phenomenal natures like Michelangelo and Beethoven.    Vasari, passing from controversy to the gossip of the studio, has  sketched a pleasant picture of the young Buonarroti in his master's  employ. \"The artistic and personal qualities of Michelangelo developed  so rapidly that Domenico was astounded by signs of power in him beyond  the ordinary scope of youth. He perceived, in short, that he not only  surpassed the other students, of whom Ghirlandajo had a large number  under his tuition, but also that he often competed on an equality with  the master. One of the lads who worked there made a pen-drawing of  some women, clothed, from a design of Ghirlandajo. Michelangelo took  up the paper, and with a broader nib corrected the outline of a female  figure, so as to bring it into perfect truth to life. Wonderful it was  to see the difference of the two styles, and to note the judgment and  ability of a mere boy, so spirited and bold, who had the courage to  chastise his master's handiwork! This drawing I now preserve as a  precious relique, since it was given me by Granacci, that it might  take a place in my Book of Original Designs, together with others  presented to me by Michelangelo. In the year 1550, when I was in Rome,  I Giorgio showed it to Michelangelo, who recognised it immediately,  and was pleased to see it again, observing modestly that he knew more  about the art when he was a child than now in his old age.    \"It happened then that Domenico was engaged upon the great Chapel of  S. Maria Novella; and being absent one day, Michelangelo set himself  to draw from nature the whole scaffolding, with some easels and all  the appurtenances of the art, and a few of the young men at work  there. When Domenico returned and saw the drawing, he exclaimed: 'This  fellow knows more about it than I do,' and remained quite stupefied by  the new style and the new method of imitation, which a boy of years so  tender had received as a gift from heaven.\"    Both Condivi and Vasari relate that, during his apprenticeship to  Ghirlandajo, Michelangelo demonstrated his technical ability by  producing perfect copies of ancient drawings, executing the facsimile  with consummate truth of line, and then dirtying the paper so as to  pass it off as the original of some old master. \"His only object,\"  adds Vasari, \"was to keep the originals, by giving copies in exchange;  seeing that he admired them as specimens of art, and sought to surpass  them by his own handling; and in doing this he acquired great renown.\"  We may pause to doubt whether at the present time--in the case, for  instance, of Shelley letters or Rossetti drawings--clever forgeries  would be accepted as so virtuous and laudable. But it ought to be  remembered that a Florentine workshop at that period contained masses  of accumulated designs, all of which were more or less the common  property of the painting firm. No single specimen possessed a high  market value. It was, in fact, only when art began to expire in Italy,  when Vasari published his extensive necrology and formed his famous  collection of drawings, that property in a sketch became a topic for  moral casuistry.    Of Michelangelo's own work at this early period we possess probably  nothing except a rough scrawl on the plaster of a wall at Settignano.  Even this does not exist in its original state. The Satyr which is  still shown there may, according to Mr. Heath Wilson's suggestion, be  a _rifacimento_ from the master's hand at a subsequent period of his  career.      V    Condivi and Vasari differ considerably in their accounts of  Michelangelo's departure from Ghirlandajo's workshop. The former  writes as follows: \"So then the boy, now drawing one thing and now  another, without fixed place or steady line of study, happened one day  to be taken by Granacci into the garden of the Medici at San Marco,  which garden the magnificent Lorenzo, father of Pope Leo, and a man of  the first intellectual distinction, had adorned with antique statues  and other reliques of plastic art. When Michelangelo saw these things  and felt their beauty, he no longer frequented Domenico's shop, nor  did he go elsewhere, but, judging the Medicean gardens to be the best  school, spent all his time and faculties in working there.\" Vasari  reports that it was Lorenzo's wish to raise the art of sculpture in  Florence to the same level as that of painting; and for this reason he  placed Bertoldo, a pupil and follower of Donatello, over his  collections, with a special commission to aid and instruct the young  men who used them. With the same intention of forming an academy or  school of art, Lorenzo went to Ghirlandajo, and begged him to select  from his pupils those whom he considered the most promising.  Ghirlandajo accordingly drafted off Francesco Granacci and  Michelangelo Buonarroti. Since Michelangelo had been formally articled  by his father to Ghirlandajo in 1488, he can hardly have left that  master in 1489 as unceremoniously as Condivi asserts. Therefore we  may, I think, assume that Vasari upon this point has preserved the  genuine tradition.    Having first studied the art of design and learned to work in colours  under the supervision of Ghirlandajo, Michelangelo now had his native  genius directed to sculpture. He began with the rudiments of  stone-hewing, blocking out marbles designed for the Library of San  Lorenzo, and acquiring that practical skill in the manipulation of the  chisel which he exercised all through his life. Condivi and Vasari  agree in relating that a copy he made for his own amusement from an  antique Faun first brought him into favourable notice with Lorenzo.  The boy had begged a piece of refuse marble, and carved a grinning  mask, which he was polishing when the Medici passed by. The great man  stopped to examine the work, and recognised its merit. At the same  time he observed with characteristic geniality: \"Oh, you have made  this Faun quite old, and yet have left him all his teeth! Do you not  know that men of that great age are always wanting in one or two?\"  Michelangelo took the hint, and knocked a tooth out from the upper  jaw. When Lorenzo saw how cleverly he had performed the task, he  resolved to provide for the boy's future and to take him into his own  household. So, having heard whose son he was, \"Go,\" he said, \"and tell  your father that I wish to speak with him.\"    A mask of a grinning Faun may still be seen in the sculpture-gallery  of the Bargello at Florence, and the marble is traditionally assigned  to Michelangelo. It does not exactly correspond to the account given  by Condivi and Vasari; for the mouth shows only two large tusk-like  teeth, with the tip of the tongue protruding between them. Still,  there is no reason to feel certain that we may not have here  Michelangelo's first extant work in marble.    \"Michelangelo accordingly went home, and delivered the message of the  Magnificent. His father, guessing probably what he was wanted for,  could only be persuaded by the urgent prayers of Granacci and other  friends to obey the summons. Indeed, he complained loudly that Lorenzo  wanted to lead his son astray, abiding firmly by the principle that he  would never permit a son of his to be a stonecutter. Vainly did  Granacci explain the difference between a sculptor and a stone-cutter:  all his arguments seemed thrown away. Nevertheless, when Lodovico  appeared before the Magnificent, and was asked if he would consent to  give his son up to the great man's guardianship, he did not know how  to refuse. 'In faith,' he added, 'not Michelangelo alone, but all of  us, with our lives and all our abilities, are at the pleasure of your  Magnificence!' When Lorenzo asked what he desired as a favour to  himself, he answered: 'I have never practised any art or trade, but  have lived thus far upon my modest income, attending to the little  property in land which has come"]]]
