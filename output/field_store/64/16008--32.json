John  Norton, since deceased. The first structure was of wood, and in 1729 the  present brick building succeeded it. King's Handbook of Boston says: \"It  is one of the few historic buildings that have been allowed to remain in  this iconoclastic age.\"    So it seems that they are troubled with iconoclasts in Boston, too. I  thought I saw one hanging around the Old South on the day I was there, and  had a good notion to point him out to the authorities, but thought it was  none of my business.    I went into the building and registered, and then from force of habit or  absent-mindedness handed my umbrella over the counter and asked how soon  supper would be ready. Everybody registers, but very few, I am told, ask  how soon supper will be ready. The Old South is now run on the European  plan, however.    The old meeting-house is chiefly remarkable for the associations that  cluster around it. Two centuries hover about the ancient weather-vane and  look down upon the visitor when the weather is favorable.    Benjamin Franklin was baptized and attended worship here, prior to his  wonderful invention of lightning. Here on each succeeding Sabbath sat the  man who afterwards snared the forked lightning with a string and put it  in a jug for future generations. Here Whitefield preached and the rebels  discussed the tyranny of the British king. Warren delivered his famous  speech here upon the anniversary of the Boston massacre and the \"tea  party\" organized in this same building. Two hundred years ago exactly,  the British used the Old South as a military riding school, although a  majority of the people of Boston were not in favor of it.    It would be well to pause here and consider the trying situation in which  our ancestors were placed at that time. Coming to Massachusetts as they  did, at a time when the country was new and prices extremely high, they  had hoped to escape from oppression and establish themselves so far away  from the tyrant that he could not come over here and disturb them without  suffering from the extreme nausea incident to a long sea voyage. Alas,  however, when they landed at Plymouth rock there was not a decent hotel in  the place. The same stern and rock-bound coast which may be discovered  along the Atlantic sea-board to-day was there, and a cruel, relentless sky  frowned upon their endeavors.    Where prosperous cities now flaunt to the sky their proud domes and  floating debts, the rank jimson weed nodded in the wind and the pumpkin  pie of to-day still slumbered in the bosom of the future. What glorious  facts have, under the benign influence of fostering centuries, been born  of apparent impossibility. What giant certainties have grown through these  years from the seeds of doubt and discouragement and uncertainty! (Big  firecrackers and applause.)    [Illustration: MR. FRANKLIN EXPERIMENTS.]    At that time our ancestors had but timidly embarked in the forefather  business. They did not know that future generations in four-button  cutaways would rise up and call them blessed and pass resolutions of  respect on their untimely death. If they stayed at home the king taxed  them all out of shape, and if they went out of Boston a few rods to get  enough huckleberries for breakfast, they would frequently come home so  full of Indian arrows that they could not get through a common door  without great pain.    Such was the early history of the country where now cultivation and  education and refinement run rampant and people sit up all night to print  newspapers so that we can have them in the morning.    The land on which the Old South stands is very valuable for business  purposes, and $400,000 will have to be raised in order to preserve the old  landmark to future generations. I earnestly hope that it will be secured,  and that the old meeting-house--dear not alone to the people of Boston,  but to the millions of Americans scattered from sea to sea, who cannot  forget where first universal freedom plumed its wings--will be spared to  entertain within its hospitable walls, enthusiastic and reverential  visitors for ages without end.          Knights of the Pen.    When you come to think of it, it is surprising that so many newspaper men  write so that any one but an expert can read it. The rapid and voluminous  work, especially of daily journalism, knocks the beautiful business  college penman, as a rule, higher than a kite. I still have specimens of  my own handwriting that a total stranger could read.    I do not remember a newspaper acquaintance whose penmanship is so  characteristic of the exacting neatness and sharp, clear cut style of the  man, as is that of Eugene Field, of the Chicago _News_. As the \"Nonpareil  Writer\" of the Denver _Tribune_, it was a mystery to me when he did the  work which the paper showed each day as his own. You would sometimes find  him at his desk, writing on large sheets of \"print paper\" with a pen and  violet ink, in a hand that was as delicate as the steel plate of a bank  note and the kind of work that printers would skirmish for. He would ask  you to sit down in the chair opposite his desk, which had two or three old  exchanges thrown on it. He would probably say, \"Never mind those papers.  I've read them. Just sit down on them if you want to.\" Encouraged by his  hearty manner, you would sit down, and you would continue to sit down till  you had protruded about three-fourths of your system through that hollow  mockery of a chair. Then he would run to help you out and curse the chair,  and feel pained because he had erroneously given you the ruin with no seat  to it. He always felt pained over such things. He always suffered keenly  and felt shocked over the accident until you had gone away, and then he  would sigh heavily and \"set\" the chair again.    [Illustration: THE RUIN.]    Frank Pixley, the editor of the San Francisco _Argonaut_, is not  beautiful, though the _Argonaut_ is. He is grim and rather on the Moses  Montefiore style of countenance, but his hand-writing does not convey the  idea of the man personally, or his style of dealing with the Chinese  question. It is rather young looking, and has the uncertain manner of an  eighteen-year-old boy.    Robert J. Burdette writes a small but plain hand, though he sometimes  suffers from the savage typographical error that steals forth at such a  moment as ye think not, and disfigures and tears and mangles the bright  eyed children of the brain.    Very often we read a man's work and imagine we shall find him like it,  cheery, bright and entertaining; but we know him and find that personally  he is a refrigerator, or an egotist, or a man with a torpid liver and a  nose like a rose geranium. You will not be disappointed in Bob Burdette,  however, You think you will like him, and you always do. He will never be  too famous to be a gentleman.    George W. Peck's hand is of the free and independent order of chirography.  It is easy and natural, but not handsome. He writes very voluminously,  doing his editorial writing in two days of the week, generally Friday and  Saturday. Then he takes a rapid horse, a zealous bird dog and an improved  double barrel duck destroyer and communes with nature.    Sam Davis, an old time Californian, and now in Nevada, writes the freest  of any penman I know. When he is deliberate, he may be betrayed into  making a deformed letter and a crooked mark attached to it, which he  characterizes as a word. He puts a lot of these together and actually pays  postage on the collection under the delusion that it is a letter, that it  will reach its destination, and that it will accomplish its object.    He makes up for his bad writing, however, by being an unpublished volume  of old time anecdotes and funny experiences.    Goodwin, of the old _Territorial Enterprise_, and Mark Twain's old  employer, writes with a pencil in a methodical manner and very plainly.  The way he sharpens a \"hard medium\" lead pencil and skins the apostle of  the so-called Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, makes my heart  glad. Hardly a day passes that his life is not threatened by the low  browed thumpers of Mormondom, and yet the old war horse raises the  standard of monogamy and under the motto, \"One country, one flag and one  wife at a time,\" he smokes his old meerschaum pipe and writes a column of  razor blades every day. He is the buzz saw upon which polygamy has tried  to sit. Fighting these rotten institutions hand to hand and fighting a  religious eccentricity through an annual message, or a feeble act of  congress, are two separate and distinct things.    If I had a little more confidence in my longevity than I now have, I would  go down there to the Valley of the Jordan, and I would gird up my loins,  and I would write with that lonely warrior at Salt Lake, and with the aid  and encouragement of our brethren of the press who do not favor the right  of one man to marry an old woman's home, we would rotten egg the bogus  Temple of Zion till the civilized world, with a patent clothes pin on its  nose, would come and see what was the matter.    I see that my zeal has led me away from my original subject, but I haven't  time to regret it now.          The Wild Cow.    When I was young and used to roam around over the country, gathering  water-melons in the light of the moon, I used to think I could milk  anybody's cow, but I do not think so now. I do not milk a cow now unless  the sign is right, and it hasn't been right for a good many years. The  last cow I tried to milk was a common cow, born in obscurity; kind of a  self-made cow. I remember her brow was low, but she wore her tail high and  she was haughty, oh, so haughty.    I made a common-place remark to her, one that is used in the very best of  society, one that need not have given offence anywhere. I said \"So\"--and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8299"],[0,"Filipino Popular Tales (#20)"],[1,"who should show sympathy for the dead man. Early  one morning the military procession started out, and passed through  the main streets of the city. When the procession arrived before  Zaragoza's house, it happened that Maria was at the window, and,  seeing the body of her husband, she cried, \"O my husband!\"    Seeing the soldiers entering their house, Zaragoza asked, \"What is  your pleasure?\"    \"We want to arrest that woman,\" was the answer of the chief of  the guard.    \"Why? She has not committed any crime.\"    \"She is the widow of that dead man. Her words betrayed her, for she  exclaimed that the dead man was her husband.\"    \"Who is her husband? That remark was meant for me, because I had  unintentionally hurt our young son,\" said Zaragoza smiling.    The soldiers believed his words, and went on their way. Reaching a  public place when it was almost night, they decided to stay there  until the next morning. Zaragoza saw his opportunity. He disguised  himself as a priest and went to the place, taking with him a bottle  of wine mixed with a strong narcotic. When he arrived, he said that  he was a priest, and, being afraid of robbers, wished to pass the  night with some soldiers. The soldiers were glad to have with them,  as they thought, a pious man, whose stories would inspire them to  do good. After they had talked a while, Zaragoza offered his bottle  of wine to the soldiers, who freely drank from it. As was expected,  they soon all fell asleep, and Zaragoza succeeded in stealing the  corpse of Luis. He took it home and buried it in that same place  where he had buried the head.    The following morning the soldiers woke up, and were surprised to see  that the priest and the corpse were gone. The king soon knew how his  scheme had failed. Then he thought of another plan. He ordered that a  sheep covered with precious metal should be let loose in the streets,  and that it should be followed by a spy, whose duty it was to watch  from a distance, and, in case any one attempted to catch the sheep,  to ascertain the house of that person, and then report to the palace.    Having received his orders, the spy let loose the sheep, and followed  it at a distance. Nobody else dared even to make a remark about the  animal; but when Zaragoza saw it, he drove it into his yard. The spy,  following instructions, marked the door of Zaragoza's house with a  cross, and hastened to the palace. The spy assured the soldiers that  they would be able to capture the criminal; but when they began to  look for the house, they found that all the houses were similarly  marked with crosses.    For the third time the king had failed; and, giving up all hopes of  catching the thief, he issued a proclamation pardoning the man who  had committed the theft, provided he would present himself to the  king within three days. Hearing the royal proclamation, Zaragoza  went before the king, and confessed that he was the perpetrator of  all the thefts that had caused so much trouble in the court. True to  his word, the king did not punish him. Instead, the king promised  to give Zaragoza a title of nobility if he could trick Don Juan,  the richest merchant in the city, out of his most valuable goods.    When he knew of the desire of the king, Zaragoza looked for a fool,  whom he could use as his instrument. He soon found one, whom he  managed to teach to say \"Si\" (Spanish for \"yes\") whenever asked  a question. Dressing the fool in the guise of a bishop, Zaragoza  took a carriage and drove to the store of D. Juan. There he began  to ask the fool such questions as these: \"Does your grace wish to  have this? Does not your grace think that this is cheap?\" to all of  which the fool's answer was \"Si.\" At last, when the carriage was  well loaded, Zaragoza said, \"I will first take these things home,  and then return with the money for them;\" to which the fool replied,  \"Si.\" When Zaragoza reached the palace with the rich goods, he was  praised by the king for his sagacity.    After a while D. Juan the merchant found out that what he thought  was a bishop was really a fool. So he went to the king and asked that  he be given justice. Moved by pity, the king restored all the goods  that had been stolen, and D. Juan wondered how his Majesty had come  into possession of his lost property.    Once more the king wanted to test Zaragoza's ability. Accordingly he  told him to bring to the palace an old hermit who lived in a cave in  the neighboring mountains. At first Zaragoza tried to persuade Tubal  to pay the visit to the king, but in vain. Having failed in his first  attempt, Zaragoza determined to play a trick on the old hermit. He  secretly placed an iron cage near the mouth of Tubal's cave, and then  in the guise of an angel he stood on a high cliff and shouted,--    \"Tubal, Tubal, hear ye me!\"    Tubal, hearing the call, came out of his cave, and, seeing what he  thought was an angel, knelt down. Then Zaragoza shouted,--    \"I know that you are very religious, and have come to reward your  piety. The gates of heaven are open, and I will lead you thither. Go  enter that cage, and you will see the way to heaven.\"    Tubal meekly obeyed; but when he was in the cage, he did not see the  miracle he expected. Instead, he was placed in a carriage and brought  before the king. Thoroughly satisfied now, the king released Tubal,  and fulfilled his promise toward Zaragoza. Zaragoza was knighted,  and placed among the chief advisers of the kingdom. After he had been  raised to this high rank, he called to his side Maria and his godson,  and they lived happily under the protection of one who became the  most upright and generous man of the realm.        Juan the Peerless Robber.    Narrated by Vicente M. Hilario, a Tagalog from Batangas, who heard  the story from a Batangas student.    Not many centuries after Charlemagne died, there lived in Europe  a famous brigand named Juan. From childhood he had been known as  \"the deceitful Juan,\" \"the unrivalled pilferer,\" \"the treacherous  Juan.\" When he was twenty, he was forced to flee from his native land,  to which he never returned.    He visited Africa, where he became acquainted with a famous Ethiopian  robber named Pedro. Not long after they had met, a dispute arose  between them as to which was the more skilful pickpocket. They decided  to have a test. They stood face to face, and the Ethiopian was first  to try his skill.    \"Hey!\" exclaimed Juan to Pedro, \"don't take my handkerchief out of  my pocket!\"    It was now Juan's turn. He unbuckled Pedro's belt and slipped it into  his own pocket. \"What's the matter with you, Juan?\" said Pedro after  a few minutes. \"Why don't you go ahead and steal something?\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" said Juan. \"Whose belt is this?\"    Pedro generously admitted that he had been defeated.    Although these two thieves were united by strong ties of common  interest, nevertheless their diverse characteristics and traits  produced trouble at times. Pedro was dull, honorable, and frank;  Juan was hawk-eyed and double-faced. Pedro had so large a body and so  awkward and shambling a gait, that Juan could not help laughing at him  and saying sarcastic things to him. Juan was good-looking and graceful.    While they were travelling about in northern Africa, they heard  the heralds of the King of Tunis make the following proclamation:  \"A big bag of money will be given to the captor of the greatest robber  in the country.\" The two friends, particularly Juan, were struck by  this announcement.    That night Juan secretly stole out of his room. Taking with him a  long rope, he climbed up to the roof of the palace. After making a  hole as large as a peso [33] in the roof, he lowered himself into  the building by means of the rope. He found the room filled with bags  of gold and silver, pearls, carbuncles, diamonds, and other precious  stones. He took the smallest bag he could find, and, after climbing  out of the hole, went home quickly.    When Pedro heard Juan's thrilling report of the untold riches, he  decided to visit the palace the following night. Early in the morning  Juan went again to the palace, taking with him a large tub. After  lowering it into the room, he departed without delay. At nightfall he  returned to the palace and filled the tub with boiling water. He had  no sooner done this than Pedro arrived. Pedro was so eager to get the  wealth, that he made no use of the rope, but jumped immediately into  the room when he reached the small opening his treacherous friend  had made in the roof. Alas! instead of falling on bags of money,  Pedro fell into the fatal tub of water, and perished.    An hour later Juan went to look for his friend, whom he found  dead. The next day he notified the king of the capture and death of  the greatest of African robbers. \"You have done well,\" said the king  to Juan. \"This man was the chief of all the African highwaymen. Take  your bag of money.\"    After putting his gold in a safe place, Juan went out in search of  further adventures. On one of his walks, he heard that a certain  wealthy and devout abbot had been praying for two days and nights  that the angel of the lord might come and take him to heaven. Juan  provided himself with two strong wings. On the third night he made  a hole as large as a peso through the dome of the church.    Calling the abbot, Juan said, \"I have been sent by the Lord to take  you to heaven. Come with me, and bring all your wealth.\"    The abbot put all his money into the bag. \"Now get into the bag,\"  said Juan, \"and we will go.\"    The old man promptly obeyed. \"Where are we now?\" said he, after an  hour's \"flight.\"    \"We are within one thousand miles of the abode of the blessed,\"  was Juan's reply.    Twenty minutes later, and they were in Juan's cave. \"Come out of the  bag, and behold my rude abode?\" said Juan to the old man. The abbot  was astounded at the sight. When he heard Juan's story, he advised  him to abandon"]]]
