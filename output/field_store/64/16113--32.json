I would'nt  have thought I could--I didn't think I could get over, but I didn't  care. I could but die if I didn't. And God helped me.'    'Were you a slave?' said the gentleman.    'Yes, sir.'    'Was your master unkind to you?'    'No, sir.'    'Was your mistress unkind to you?'    'No, sir--no. My mistress was always good to me.'    'What could make you leave a good home, then, and run away, and go  through such danger?'    'They wanted to take my boy away from me--to sell him--to sell him down  south, ma'am. To go all alone--a baby that had never been away from his  mother in his life. I couldn't bear it. I took him, and ran away in the  night. They chased me, they were coming down close behind me, and I  heard 'em. I jumped right on to the ice. How I got across I don't know.  The first I knew, a man was helping me up the bank.'    It was such a sad story, that the tears came into the eyes of everyone  who heard her tell it.    [Illustration]    'Where do you mean to go to, poor woman?' asked the lady.    'To Canada, if I only knew where that was. Is it very far off, is  Canada'? said Eliza, looking up in a simple, trusting way, to the kind  lady's face.    'Poor woman,' said she again.    'Is it a great way off?' asked Eliza.    'Yes,' said the lady of the house sadly, 'it is far away. But we will  try to help you to get there.' Eliza wanted to go to Canada, because it  belonged to the British. They did not allow any one to be made a slave  there. George, too, was going to try to reach Canada.    'Wife,' said the gentleman, when they had gone back again into their  own sitting-room, 'we must get that poor woman away to-night. She is not  safe here. I know some good people, far in the country, who will take  care of her.'    So this kind gentleman got the carriage ready, and drove Eliza and her  boy a long, long way, through the dark night, to a cottage far in the  country. There he left her with a good man and his wife, who promised to  be kind to her, and help her to go to Canada. He gave some money to the  good man too, and told him to use it for Eliza.          CHAPTER VI      UNCLE TOM SAYS GOOD-BYE      The day after the hunt for Eliza was a very sad one in Uncle Tom's  cabin. It was the day on which Haley was going to take Uncle Tom away.    Aunt Chloe had been up very early. She had washed and ironed all Tom's  clothes, and packed his trunk neatly. Now she was cooking the  breakfast,--the last breakfast she would ever cook for her dear husband.  Her eyes were quite red and swollen with crying, and the tears kept  running down her cheeks all the time.    'It's the last time,' said Tom sadly.    Aunt Chloe could not answer. She sat down, buried her face in her hands,  and sobbed aloud.    'S'pose we must be resigned. But, O Lord, how can I? If I knew anything  where you was goin', or how they'd treat you! Missis says she'll try and  buy you back again in a year or two. But, Lor', nobody never comes back  that goes down there.'    'There'll be the same God there, Chloe, that there is here.'    'Well,' said Aunt Chloe, 's'pose dere will. But the Lord lets drefful  things happen sometimes. I don't seem to get no comfort dat way.'    'Let's think on our mercies,' said Tom, in a shaking voice.    'Mercies!' said Aunt Chloe, 'don't see any mercies in 't. It isn't  right! it isn't right it should be so! Mas'r never ought to have left it  so that ye could be took for his debts. Mebbe he can't help himself now,  but I feel it's wrong. Nothing can beat that out of me. Such a faithful  crittur as ye've been, reckonin' on him more than your own wife and  chil'en.'    'Chloe! now, if ye love me, you won't talk so, when it is perhaps jest  the last time we'll ever have together,' said Tom.    'Wall, anyway, there's wrong about it somewhere,' said Aunt Chloe, 'I  can't jest make out where 'tis. But there is wrong somewhere, I'm sure  of that.'    Neither Tom nor Chloe could eat any breakfast; their hearts were too  full of sorrow. But the little children, who hardly understood what was  happening, enjoyed theirs. It was not often that they had such a fine  one as Chloe had cooked for Tom's last morning at home.    [Illustration]    Breakfast was just finished, when Mrs. Shelby came. Chloe was not very  pleased to see her. She was angry, and blamed her for letting Tom be  sold.    But Mrs. Shelby did not seem to see Aunt Chloe's angry looks. 'Tom,' she  said, turning to him, 'I come to--' she could say no more, she was  crying so bitterly.    Then all Aunt Chloe's anger faded away.    'Lor', now missis, don't-don't,' she said. She too burst out crying  again, and for a few minutes they all sobbed together.    'Tom,' said Mrs. Shelby at last, 'I can't do anything for you now. But  I promise you, most solemnly, to save as much, money as I can. As soon  as I have enough, I will buy you back again.'    Just then Haley arrived. Tom said a last sad good-bye to his wife and  children, and got into the cart, which Haley had brought with him.    As soon as Tom was seated in the cart, Haley took a heavy chain, and  fastened it round his ankles. Poor Tom had done nothing wrong, yet he  was treated worse than a thief, just because he was a slave.    'You don't need to do that,' said Mrs. Shelby, 'Tom won't run away.'    'Don't know so much about that, ma'am; I've lost one already. I can't  afford to run any more risks,' replied Haley.    'Please give my love to Mas'r George,' said Tom, looking round sadly.  'Tell him how sorry I am he is not at home to say good-bye.'    Master George was Mr. and Mrs. Shelby's son. He was very fond of Tom,  and was teaching him to write. He often used to come and have tea in  Uncle Tom's little cottage. Aunt Chloe used to make her very nicest  cakes when Mas'r George came to tea. But he was not at home now, and did  not know that Tom had been sold.    Haley whipped up the horse, and, with a last sad look at the old place,  Tom was whirled away to a town called Washington.          CHAPTER VII      UNCLE TOM MEETS EVA      Haley stayed in Washington several days. He went to market each day and  bought more slaves. He put heavy chains on their hands and feet, and  sent them to prison along with Tom.    When he had bought all the slaves he wanted, and was ready to go, he  drove them before him, like a herd of cattle, on to a boat which was  going south.    It was a beautiful boat. The deck was gay with lovely ladies and fine  gentlemen walking about enjoying the bright spring sunshine.    Down on the lower deck, in the dark, among the luggage, were crowded Tom  and the other poor slaves.    Some of the ladies and gentlemen on board were very sorry for the poor  niggers, and pitied them. Others never thought about them at all, or if  they did, thought it was quite just and proper that they should be  treated badly. 'They are only slaves,' they said.    Among the passengers was a pretty little girl, about six years old. She  had beautiful golden hair, and big blue eyes. She ran about here, there,  and everywhere, dancing and laughing like a little fairy. There were  other children on board, but not one so pretty or so merry as she. She  was always dressed in white, and Tom thought she looked like a little  angel, as she danced and ran about.    Often and often she would come and walk sadly around the place where the  poor slaves sat in their chains. She would look pityingly at them, and  then go slowly away. Once or twice she came with her dress full of  sweets, nuts, and oranges, and gave them all some.    Tom watched the little lady, and tried to make friends with her. His  pockets were full of all kinds of things, with which he used to amuse  his old master's children.    He could make whistles of every sort and size, cut baskets out of  cherry-stones, faces out of nut-shells, jumping figures out of bits of  wood. He brought these out one by one, and though the little girl was  shy at first, they soon grew to be great friends.    'What is missy's name?' said Tom one day.    'Evangeline St. Clare,' said the little girl; 'though papa and everybody  else call me Eva. Now, what's your name?'    'My name's Tom. The little chil'en at my old home used to call me Uncle  Tom.'    'Then I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,' said  Eva. 'So, Uncle Tom, where are you going?'    'I don't know, Miss Eva.'    'Don't know?' said Eva.    'No. I'm going to be sold to somebody. I don't know who.'    'My papa can buy you, said Eva quickly. 'If he buys you you will have  good times. I mean to ask him to, this very day.'    'Thank you, my little lady,' said Tom.    Just at this moment, the boat stopped at a small landing-place to take  in some wood. Eva heard her father's voice, and ran away to speak to  him.    Tom too rose and walked to the side. He was allowed to go about now  without chains. He was so good and gentle, that even a man like Haley  could not help seeing that it could do no harm to let him go free.    Tom helped the sailors to carry the wood on the boat. He was so big and  strong that they were very glad to have his help.    [Illustration]    Eva and her father were standing by the railings as the boat once more  began to move. It had hardly left the landing-stage when, some how or  other, Eva lost her balance. She fell right over the side of the boat  into the water.    Tom was standing just under her, on the lower deck, as she fell. In one  moment he sprang after her. The next he had caught her his arms, and was  swimming with her to the boat-side, where eager hands were held out to  take her.    The whole boat was in confusion. Every one ran to help Eva, while the  poor slave went back to his place, unnoticed and uncared for.    But Mr. St. Clare did not forget.    The next day Tom sat on the lower deck, with folded arms, anxiously  watching him as he talked to Haley.    Eva's father was a very handsome man. He was like Eva,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11198"],[0,"Christianity and Islam (#3)"],[1,"nation. He  regards all preceding prophets in the light of his own personality.  They were all sent to people who refused them a hearing at the moment.  Punishment follows and the prophet finds a body of believers  elsewhere. These temporary punishments are confused with the final  Judgment; in fact Muhammed's system was not clearly thought out. The  several prophets were but men, whose earthly careers were necessarily  crowned with triumph: hence the crucifixion of Jesus is a malicious  invention of the Jews, who in reality crucified some other sufferer,  while Jesus entered the divine glory. Thus Muhammed has no idea of the  importance of the Crucifixion to the Christian Church, as is shown by  his treatment of it as a Jewish falsehood. In fact, he develops the  habit of characterising as false any statement in contradiction with  his ideas, and this tendency is especially obvious in his dealings  with Judaism, of which he gained a more intimate knowledge. At first  he would refer sceptics to Christian and Jewish doctrine for  confirmation of his own teaching. The fact that with no knowledge of  the Old or New Testament, he had proclaimed doctrines materially  similar and the fact that these Scriptures referred to himself, were  proofs of his inspired power, let doubters say what they would. A  closer acquaintance with these Scriptures showed him that the  divergencies which he stigmatised as falsifications denoted in reality  vast doctrinal differences.    In order to understand Muhammed's attitude towards Christianity, we  will examine in greater detail his view of this religion, the portions  of it which he accepted or which he rejected as unauthentic. In the  first place he must have regarded the Trinity as repugnant to reason:  he considered the Christian Trinity as consisting of God the Father,  Mary the Mother of God, and Jesus the Son of God. In the Qoran, God  says, \"Hast thou, Jesus, said to men, Regard me and my mother as Gods  by the side of God?\" Jesus replies, \"I will say nothing but the truth.  I have but preached, Pray to God, who is my Lord and your Lord\"  (5.116, f). Hence it has been inferred that Muhammed's knowledge of  Christianity was derived from some particular Christian sect, such as  the Tritheists or the Arab female sect of the Collyridians who  worshipped the Virgin Mary with exaggerated reverence and assigned  divine honours to her. It is also possible that we have here a  development of some Gnostic conception which regarded the Holy Ghost  as of feminine gender, as Semites would do;[A] instances of this  change are to be found in the well-known Hymn of the Soul in the Acts  of Thomas, in the Gospel to the Egyptians and elsewhere. I am  inclined, however, to think it more probable that Muhammed had heard  of Mariolatry and of the \"mother of God,\" a title which then was a  highly popular catchword, and that the apotheosis of Jesus was known  to him and also the doctrine of the Trinity by name. Further than this  his knowledge did not extend; although he knows the Holy Ghost and  identifies him with Jesus, none the less his primitive reasoning,  under the influence of many old beliefs, explained the mysterious  triad of the Trinity as husband, wife, and son. This fact is enough to  prove that his theory of Christianity was formed by combining isolated  scraps of information and that he cannot have had any direct  instruction from a Christian knowing the outlines of his faith.    [Footnote A: The word for \"Spirit\" is of the feminine gender in the  Semitic languages.]    Muhammed must also have denied the divinity of Christ: this is an  obvious result of the course of mental development which we have  described and of his characteristically Semitic theory of the nature  of God. To him, God is one, never begetting and never begotten.  Denying the divinity of Jesus, Muhammed naturally denies the  redemption through the Cross and also the fact of the Crucifixion.  Yet, strangely enough he accepted the miraculous birth; nor did he  hesitate to provide this purely human Jesus with all miraculous  attributes; these were a proof of his divine commission, and  marvellous details of this nature aroused the interest of his hearers.    Mary the sister of Ahron--an obvious confusion with the Old Testament  Miriam--had been devoted to the service of God by her mother's vow, and  lives in the temple under the guardianship of Zacharias, to whom a  later heir is born in answer to his prayers, namely John, the  forerunner of the Holy Ghost. The birth is announced to Mary and she  brings forth Jesus under a palm-tree, near which is a running spring  and by the dates of which she is fed. On her return home she is  received with reproaches by her family but merely points in reply to  the new-born babe, who suddenly speaks from his cradle, asserting that  he is the prophet of God. Afterwards Jesus performs all kinds of  miracles, forms birds out of clay and makes them fly, heals the blind  and lepers, raises the dead, etc., and even brings down from heaven a  table ready spread. The Jews will not believe him, but the youth  follow him. He is not killed, but translated to God. Christians are  not agreed upon the manner of his death and the Jews have invented the  story of the Crucifixion.    Muhammed's knowledge of Christianity thus consists of certain isolated  details, partly apocryphal, partly canonical, together with a hazy  idea of the fundamental dogmas. Thus the influence of Christianity  upon him was entirely indirect. The Muhammedan movement at its outset  was influenced not by the real Christianity of the time but by a  Christianity which Muhammed criticised in certain details and forced  into harmony with his preconceived ideas. His imagination was  profoundly impressed by the existence of Christianity as a revealed  religion with a founder of its own. Certain features of Christianity  and of Judaism, prayer, purification, solemn festivals, scriptures,  prophets and so forth were regarded by him as essential to any  religious community, because they happened to belong both to Judaism  and to Christianity. He therefore adopted or wished to adopt these  institutions.    During the period of his life at Medina, Muhammed abandoned his  original idea of preaching the doctrines which Moses and Jesus had  proclaimed. This new development was the outcome of a struggle with  Judaism following upon an unsuccessful attempt at compromise. In point  of fact Judaism and Christianity were as widely different from one  another as they were from his own teaching and he was more than ever  inclined to regard as his special forerunner, Abraham, who had  preceded both Moses and Jesus, and was revered by both religions as  the man of God. He then brought Abraham into connection with the  ancient Meccan Ka'ba worship: the Ka'ba or die was a sacred stone  edifice, in one corner of which the \"black stone\" had been built in:  this stone was an object of reverence to the ancient Arabs, as it  still is to the Muhammedans. Thus Islam gradually assumed the form of  an Arab religion, developing universalist tendencies in the ultimate  course of events. Muhammed, therefore, as he was the last in the ranks  of the prophets, must also be the greatest. He epitomised all prophecy  and Islam superseded every revealed religion of earlier date.    Muhammed's original view that earlier religions had been founded by  God's will and through divine revelation, led both him and his  successors to make an important concession: adherents of other  religions were not compelled to adopt Islam. They were allowed to  observe their own faith unhindered, if they surrendered without  fighting, and were even protected against their enemies, in return for  which they had to pay tribute to their Muslim masters; this was levied  as a kind of poll-tax. Thus we read in the Qoran (ix. 29) that \"those  who possess Scriptures,\" i.e. the Jews and Christians, who did not  accept Islam were to be attacked until they paid the _gizja_ or  tribute. Thus the object of a religious war upon the Christians is not  expressed by the cry \"Death or Islam\"; such attacks were intended  merely to extort an acknowledgment of Muhammedan supremacy, not to  abolish freedom of religious observance. It would be incorrect for the  most part to regard the warrior bands which started from Arabia as  inspired by religious enthusiasm or to attribute to them the  fanaticism which was first aroused by the crusades and in an even  greater degree by the later Turkish wars. The Muhammedan fanatics of  the wars of conquest, whose reputation was famous among later  generations, felt but a very scanty interest in religion and  occasionally displayed an ignorance of its fundamental tenets which we  can hardly exaggerate. The fact is fully consistent with the impulses  to which the Arab migrations were due. These impulses were economic  and the new religion was nothing more than a party cry of unifying  power, though there is no reason to suppose that it was not a real  moral force in the life of Muhammed and his immediate contemporaries.    Anti-Christian fanaticism there was therefore none. Even in early  years Muhammedans never refused to worship in the same buildings as  Christians. The various insulting regulations which tradition  represents Christians as forced to endure were directed not so much  against the adherents of another faith as against the barely tolerated  inhabitants of a subjugated state. It is true that the distinction is  often difficult to observe, as religion and nationality were one and  the same thing to Muhammedans. In any case religious animosity was a  very subordinate phenomenon. It was a gradual development and seems to  me to have made a spasmodic beginning in the first century under the  influence of ideas adopted from Christianity. It may seem paradoxical  to assert that it was Christian influence which first stirred Islam to  religious animosity "]]]
