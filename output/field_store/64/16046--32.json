These aspirations have conspicuously      been made manifest in their determined and well-organised efforts to      arrest the progress of the Germanic aggression.        \"In these circumstances, the Japanese Government are happy to regard      the Czecho-Slovak army as an Allied and belligerent army waging regular      warfare against Austria-Hungary and Germany, and to recognise the      rights of the Czecho-Slovak National Council to exercise the supreme      control over that army. They are further prepared to enter into      communication with the duly authorised representatives of the      Czecho-Slovak National Council, whenever necessary, on all matters of      mutual interest to the Japanese and the Czecho-Slovak forces in      Siberia.\"        VII    THE CZECHS AT HOME BEGIN TO SPEAK    The opening of the Reichsrat in May, 1917, was intended to give Austria the  appearance of a \"democratic\" country in which diverse nationalities live in  peace and happiness. Democratic indeed! A parliament, subject to  censorship, lacking the freedom of speech and all influence on the  government, with 463 members instead of 516, many of whom were still in  prison and in exile! And if there was still any person in the Allied  countries having any doubts concerning the attitude of the Czechs and  Yugoslavs, these doubts were certainly dispelled after the courageous  indictment against Austria made by the Slav deputies, representing  practically all the Czech and Yugoslav political parties. The declaration  of the Poles in favour of a united and independent Poland, the statement of  Messrs. Stanek and Korosec in the name of _all_ Czechs and Yugoslavs in  favour of a Czecho-Slovak and Yugoslav State, the speech of deputy Kalina  denying all responsibility of the Czechs for the war, and expressing Czech  sympathies with the Entente Powers, and the terrible story of persecutions  which the Czechs had to suffer from Austria during the war, told by deputy  Stribrny, formed a veritable \"Mene Tekel,\" a death sentence pronounced by  the Austrian Slavs on their tyrants in Vienna and Budapest.    The revelation in the Reichsrat of the hopeless state of decay prevailing  in Austria-Hungary was, of course, due to the Russian Revolution. If it was  not for the Russian Revolution, the Austrian Emperor and Clam-Martinic  would perhaps have continued their reign of absolutism by way of imperial  decrees, and they would never have dreamt of convoking the Reichsrat.    However, the desperate economic and political situation forced Austria to  find some way out of her difficulties, and to plead for peace as she began  to realise that otherwise she was doomed. The change of order and the  situation in Russia and the uncertain attitude of some Allied statesmen  seemed favourable for the Austrian calculations respecting a separate  peace. But Austria could not possibly hope to deceive free Russia or the  Allies and lure them into concluding a premature peace if the reign of  terrorism and absolutism still prevailed in the Dual Monarchy. For this  reason Tisza, with his sinister reputation, was forced to go, and the  Reichsrat was convened. Austria based her plans on the ignorance of some  Allied politicians who really believed in the \"new orientation\" of the  Vienna Government because of the Bohemian _names_ (not sympathies) of  Clam-Martinic and Czernin. In the same way Austria wanted to make outsiders  believe that a change in the name of the Hungarian Premier meant a change  of system, and that the convocation of the Reichsrat meant a new era of  \"democracy\" in Austria.    Neither of these assumptions was, of course, correct. If the Magyars talk  of introducing universal suffrage, they want to extend it to Magyar  electors, and on one condition only, viz. that all the candidates shall be  of _Magyar_ nationality, or, as the Hungarian Premier, Count Esterhazy, put  it, \"democracy in Hungary can only be a Magyar democracy\"--that is, a  system utterly at variance with the principles of justice.    But far from averting the doom of Austria and bringing her peace and  consolation, the opening of the Reichsrat only hastened Austria's downfall,  for it enabled the Austrian Slavs, who now felt that the moment had come  for them to speak, to declare before the whole world their aspirations, and  their determination to destroy the monarchy.    _(a) The Czech Declaration of May_ 30, 1917    Before entering the Reichsrat, the Czechs made it clear that they no longer  desired any compromise with Austria. In a manifesto signed by 150 Czech  authors and subsequently endorsed by professors, teachers and various  societies and corporations, the Czech deputies were reminded that the fate  of their nation was at stake:        \"The doors of the Austrian Parliament are opening and the political      representatives of the nations have for the first time the opportunity      of speaking and acting freely. Whatever they may say and decide will be      heard not only at home, but also throughout Europe and overseas.... The      programme of our nation is founded on its history and racial unity, on      its modern political life and rights. The present time emphasises the      necessity for carrying out this programme completely.... To-day you are      forced to develop this programme, to defend it to the last breath      before the forum of Europe, and to demand its realisation without      limitations.... Democratic Europe, the Europe of free and independent      nations, is the Europe of the future. The nation asks you to be equal      to this historic occasion, to devote to it all your abilities and to      sacrifice to it all other considerations....\"    And to this appeal of their nation the Czech, deputies did not turn a deaf  ear.    On entering the Reichsrat on May 30, 1917, Mr. Stanek, president of the  Union of Czech Deputies, made the following memorable declaration in the  name of all the Czech deputies:        \"While taking our stand at this historic moment on the natural right of      peoples to self-determination and free development--a right which in      our case is further strengthened by inalienable historic rights fully      recognised by this state--we shall, at the head of our people, work for      _the union of all branches of the Czecho-Slovak nation in a single      democratic Bohemian State_, comprising also the Slovak branch of our      nation which lives in the lands adjoining our Bohemian Fatherland.\"    Both the Yugoslav and the Polish press greeted this declaration with  undisguised joy and sympathy.    The _Glos Naroda_ welcomed the Czech declaration, and added: \"Those who  to-day are asking for an independent national existence do not claim  anything but the minimum of their rights. Nothing less could satisfy them  (_i.e._ the Czechs and Yugo-slavs), seeing that even smaller and less  historic nations claim the same.\" The _Nowa Reforma_ also said that the  Czechs were quite right to ask for full independence. \"They are entitled to  it by their position in which they can lose nothing more than they have  lost already, but gain a great deal. Among the Entente Powers there is  nobody who would have an open or disguised interest in opposing even the  boldest claims of the Czecho-Slovak nation.\"    The declaration of deputy Stanek was completed by a statement of deputy  Kalina who made it quite clear that the Czechs refuse responsibility for  the war, and that their sympathies are with the Entente. Kalina, a  prominent leader of the State Right Party, said:        \"As deputies elected by the Czech nation, _we absolutely reject every      responsibility for this war_.        \"After three years, the government has summoned the _Reichsrat, which      the Czechs never recognised_, and against which, as well as against the      so-called constitution, they again make a formal protest. The great      Russian Revolution forced the government to a plausible restoration of      constitutional life.        \"_The Czech nation hails with unbounded joy and enthusiasm the      liberation of Eastern Europe_. The main principles of that memorable      Revolution are closely related to our own traditions, _i.e._ to the      principle of _liberty, equality and fraternity of all nations_. Bohemia      is a free country. Never in her history did she accept laws from      aliens, not even from her powerful neighbours in Europe. Liberty of      individuals, liberty of nations is again our motto which the nation of      Hussites is bringing before the world. In these historic moments, when      from the blood-deluged battlefields a new Europe is arising, and the      idea of the sovereignty of nations and nationalities is triumphantly      marching throughout the Continent, _the Czech nation solemnly declares      before the world its firm will for liberty and independence_ on the      ground of the ancient historic rights of the Bohemian Crown. In      demanding independence, the Czech nation asks, in the sense of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (#20)"],[1,"therefore conclude, either  that they are not criminal, or that the Deity, not man, is accountable  for them. But as either of these positions is absurd and impious, it  follows, that the doctrine from which they are deduced cannot possibly  be true, as being liable to all the same objections. An absurd  consequence, if necessary, proves the original doctrine to be absurd; in  the same manner as criminal actions render criminal the original cause,  if the connexion between them be necessary and evitable.    This objection consists of two parts, which we shall examine separately;  _First_, that, if human actions can be traced up, by a necessary chain,  to the Deity, they can never be criminal; on account of the infinite  perfection of that Being from whom they are derived, and who can intend  nothing but what is altogether good and laudable. Or, _Secondly_, if  they be criminal, we must retract the attribute of perfection, which we  ascribe to the Deity, and must acknowledge him to be the ultimate author  of guilt and moral turpitude in all his creatures.    79. The answer to the first objection seems obvious and convincing.  There are many philosophers who, after an exact scrutiny of all the  phenomena of nature, conclude, that the WHOLE, considered as one system,  is, in every period of its existence, ordered with perfect benevolence;  and that the utmost possible happiness will, in the end, result to all  created beings, without any mixture of positive or absolute ill or  misery. Every physical ill, say they, makes an essential part of this  benevolent system, and could not possibly be removed, even by the Deity  himself, considered as a wise agent, without giving entrance to greater  ill, or excluding greater good, which will result from it. From this  theory, some philosophers, and the ancient _Stoics_ among the rest,  derived a topic of consolation under all afflictions, while they taught  their pupils that those ills under which they laboured were, in reality,  goods to the universe; and that to an enlarged view, which could  comprehend the whole system of nature, every event became an object of  joy and exultation. But though this topic be specious and sublime, it  was soon found in practice weak and ineffectual. You would surely more  irritate than appease a man lying under the racking pains of the gout by  preaching up to him the rectitude of those general laws, which produced  the malignant humours in his body, and led them through the proper  canals, to the sinews and nerves, where they now excite such acute  torments. These enlarged views may, for a moment, please the imagination  of a speculative man, who is placed in ease and security; but neither  can they dwell with constancy on his mind, even though undisturbed by  the emotions of pain or passion; much less can they maintain their  ground when attacked by such powerful antagonists. The affections take a  narrower and more natural survey of their object; and by an economy,  more suitable to the infirmity of human minds, regard alone the beings  around us, and are actuated by such events as appear good or ill to the  private system.    80. The case is the same with _moral_ as with _physical_ ill. It cannot  reasonably be supposed, that those remote considerations, which are  found of so little efficacy with regard to one, will have a more  powerful influence with regard to the other. The mind of man is so  formed by nature that, upon the appearance of certain characters,  dispositions, and actions, it immediately feels the sentiment of  approbation or blame; nor are there any emotions more essential to its  frame and constitution. The characters which engage our approbation are  chiefly such as contribute to the peace and security of human society;  as the characters which excite blame are chiefly such as tend to public  detriment and disturbance: Whence it may reasonably be presumed, that  the moral sentiments arise, either mediately or immediately, from a  reflection of these opposite interests. What though philosophical  meditations establish a different opinion or conjecture; that everything  is right with regard to the WHOLE, and that the qualities, which disturb  society, are, in the main, as beneficial, and are as suitable to the  primary intention of nature as those which more directly promote its  happiness and welfare? Are such remote and uncertain speculations able  to counterbalance the sentiments which arise from the natural and  immediate view of the objects? A man who is robbed of a considerable  sum; does he find his vexation for the loss anywise diminished by these  sublime reflections? Why then should his moral resentment against the  crime be supposed incompatible with them? Or why should not the  acknowledgment of a real distinction between vice and virtue be  reconcileable to all speculative systems of philosophy, as well as that  of a real distinction between personal beauty and deformity? Both these  distinctions are founded in the natural sentiments of the human mind:  And these sentiments are not to be controuled or altered by any  philosophical theory or speculation whatsoever.    81. The _second_ objection admits not of so easy and satisfactory an  answer; nor is it possible to explain distinctly, how the Deity can be  the mediate cause of all the actions of men, without being the author of  sin and moral turpitude. These are mysteries, which mere natural and  unassisted reason is very unfit to handle; and whatever system she  embraces, she must find herself involved in inextricable difficulties,  and even contradictions, at every step which she takes with regard to  such subjects. To reconcile the indifference and contingency of human  actions with prescience; or to defend absolute decrees, and yet free the  Deity from being the author of sin, has been found hitherto to exceed  all the power of philosophy. Happy, if she be thence sensible of her  temerity, when she pries into these sublime mysteries; and leaving a  scene so full of obscurities and perplexities, return, with suitable  modesty, to her true and proper province, the examination of common  life; where she will find difficulties enough to employ her enquiries,  without launching into so boundless an ocean of doubt, uncertainty, and  contradiction!        SECTION IX.    OF THE REASON OF ANIMALS.      82. All our reasonings concerning matter of fact are founded on a  species of Analogy, which leads us to expect from any cause the same  events, which we have observed to result from similar causes. Where the  causes are entirely similar, the analogy is perfect, and the inference,  drawn from it, is regarded as certain and conclusive: nor does any man  ever entertain a doubt, where he sees a piece of iron, that it will have  weight and cohesion of parts; as in all other instances, which have ever  fallen under his observation. But where the objects have not so exact a  similarity, the analogy is less perfect, and the inference is less  conclusive; though still it has some force, in proportion to the degree  of similarity and resemblance. The anatomical observations, formed upon  one animal, are, by this species of reasoning, extended to all animals;  and it is certain, that when the circulation of the blood, for instance,  is clearly proved to have place in one creature, as a frog, or fish, it  forms a strong presumption, that the same principle has place in all.  These analogical observations may be carried farther, even to this  science, of which we are now treating; and any theory, by which we  explain the operations of the understanding, or the origin and connexion  of the passions in man, will acquire additional authority, if we find,  that the same theory is requisite to explain the same phenomena in all  other animals. We shall make trial of this, with regard to the  hypothesis, by which we have, in the foregoing discourse, endeavoured  to account for all experimental reasonings; and it is hoped, that this  new point of view will serve to confirm all our former observations.    83. _First_, It seems evident, that animals as well as men learn many  things from experience, and infer, that the same events will always  follow from the same causes. By this principle they become acquainted  with the more obvious properties of external objects, and gradually,  from their birth, treasure up a knowledge of the nature of fire, water,  earth, stones, heights, depths, &c., and of the effects which result  from their operation. The ignorance and inexperience of the young are  here plainly distinguishable from the cunning and sagacity of the old,  who have learned, by long observation, to avoid what hurt them, and to  pursue what gave ease or pleasure. A horse, that has been accustomed to  the field, becomes acquainted with the proper height which he can leap,  and will never attempt what exceeds his force and ability. An old  greyhound will trust the more fatiguing part of the chace to the  younger, and will place himself so as to meet the hare in her doubles;  nor are the conjectures, which he forms on this occasion, founded in any  thing but his observation and experience.    This is still more evident from the effects of discipline and education  on animals, who, by the proper application of rewards and punishments,  may be taught any course of action, and most contrary to their natural  instincts and propensities. Is it not experience, which renders a dog  apprehensive of pain, when you menace him, or lift up the whip to beat  him? Is it not even experience, which makes him answer to his name, and  infer, from such an arbitrary sound, that you mean him rather than any  of his fellows, and intend to call him, when you pronounce it in a  certain manner, and with a certain tone and accent?    In all these cases, we may observe, that the animal infers some fact  beyond what immediately strikes his senses; and that this inference is  altogether founded on"]]]
