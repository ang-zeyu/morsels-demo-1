May 20, 45: The generals and colonels formerly stationed in the  Philippines, arrived in camp from Sian, Manchuria. The generals  included Wainwright, King, Moore, Parker, Sharp and Jones as well as  Sir Arthur Percival from Singapore. The colonels were Selleck, Horan,  Balsa, Brauner, Aldridge, Cooper and Gillespie. All were optimistic,  believing they were on their way home.       The following paragraphs were from Col. James Gillespie's Report of  World War II in the Far East:       \"As we marched into the Camp, many prisoners stood about with some  curiosity watching our arrival.    \"I happened to glance up at someone standing near the hospital. He was  literally skin and bones - extremely emaciated, with a pale face that  I knew I had seen before; his lower limbs were greatly swollen; as I  passed within three feet of him, his identity flashed into my mind. It  was Major Eugene Jacobs; he had served with me at the Sternberg Army  Hospital in Manila.    \"In a few days I was to hear from Jacobs, one of 300 survivors of the  Oryoku Maru, the most horrible story of suffering by prisoners during  World War II, in which 50% of the medical personnel serving in  Sternberg Hospital, and General Hospital No.2 on Bataan, were wiped  out from bombings and privations.\"    Col. Gillespie became the new hospital commander.             May 25, 45: Able to shuffle outside the building and sit in  the sunshine, visiting with Army friends - made sketches of several.  By moving to different of the camp, I made an accurate map of the  camp, as seen from the air.    Jun. 1, 45: Had interesting visits with British, Australian and Dutch  prisoners; made sketches of several. Enjoyed trading U.S. Army buttons  for their Regimental buttons. Still very weak; called the \"Walking  ghost!\" Wt. 106 lbs.    Jun. 15, 45: Rumors that MacArthur had taken Okinawa with big loss of  life.    Jul. 1, 45: Spent much time sitting alone in the yard, soaking up the  sun and thinking of Judy-making plans for the \"Peace\" that seemed to  be coming.    Aug. 9, 45: Rumors of a conference in Berlin: that an ultimatum given  to Japan. Air raid alarm during night; no bombing near by.             Aug. 10, 45: Rumors the U.S. had dropped an Adam bomb on  Hiroshima on August 6th with much devastation. Rumors Russia had  declared war on Japan on August 8th; Russians were anxious to share  the Spoils of War. Planes overhead very active; no bombs.             Aug. 12, 45: Japanese soldiers all wearing battle dress and  carrying packs on their backs. Camouflaged trucks and tanks on the  streets.    Aug. 13, 45: Rumors that a second Adam bomb was dropped on Nagasaki,  and that Russia was invading Manchuria.       Aug. 16,45: Rumors that Japan had surrendered on the 14th.    Cooks are baking extra corn buns.       Rumors that prisoners would be marched to Outer Mongolia (Gobi  Desert) to prevent recapture. \"Big Deal!\"    A big bomber (B-29) flew over camp dropping parachutes just outside  camp. Six paratroopers (O.S.S.) led by an Army Medic, Major LaMar,  came into camp carrying parachutes, radios, first aid boxes, etc. They  went directly to the hospital, where they were secluded. Everyone  concluded the war must be over. It hadn't ended as we had expected.  Mukden was quiet; no shooting.    Much excitement in camp; prisoners staying up after curfew, playing  poker and smoking away from ashtrays (a No No). The guards finally  admitted: \"Waul is oval!\" and later, \"Ve aul tomadachi (friends) now!\"    Aug. 17, 45: About 0800, General Parker announced, \"I am now in  command; an Armistice will be signed soon!\"    Aug. 18, 45: Col. Gillespie called me to the hospital. He said, \"Gene,  you are the sickest doctor in camp. I am assigning you to go out on  the first plane with 31 of the sickest patients.    I hope that some of you will survive to visit with your families. We  will give you what little medicine we have.\"    I packed my few worthless possessions in a duffle bag, and then  obtained a small notebook and got the names and addresses of two  hundred prisoners' families, to be notified, when I reached the  States.    About 1700, a U.S. bomber (B-24, Liberator) came low over camp,  dipping its large wings and dropping thousands of leaflets. It was  accompanied by many very fast Russian fighters (MIGs).    About 1800, Russian troops arrived in the Prison compound. A 31 year  old general stood on a box, saying \"Three weeks ago in Berlin, I saw  General Eisenhower and told him I would liberate the American  prisoners in Manchuria. You are now liberated!\" Much cheering!                           Chapter XII JAPAN SURRENDERS        About 1900, Col. Masuda and the Jap guard marched on to the field and  officially laid their arms on the ground. Selected American prisoners  picked up the weapons, and marched the Japs to the Guardhouse.       Now getting all we wanted to eat; some ate too much and got  sick. Told to be ready to leave tomorrow on a B-24.       Aug. 22, 45: Flight cancelled! A drunk Russian guard had bayoneted  the tires of the U.S. plane.    Much shooting outside the walls. The bodies of two Chinamen in black  shrouds were swinging gently in the breeze from tall factory chimneys.  It was OK for the Russians to loot, rape and plunder, but not for the  Chinese.                                   Chapter XIII                                  START HOME         Aug. 24, 45: About 0800 we leave Camp Hoten Main Gate in a truck  and two cars, a doctor and his 31 patients.       Saw many Russian soldiers and tanks passing through Mukden.       About 1000 we took off in two B-24s (Liberators); ours was named  the\" Homesick Angel.\" We sat in the bomb bays, eating C rations and K  rations, the greatest invention of the war.       Passed over the Great Wall of China.      Sian, China         About 1600, landed at Sian - considered the cradle of Chinese  civilization and the first capital of China.    The U.S. Flag flying over the base was a beautiful sight. Had a fine  American dinner and in the evening were shown a movie, \"If I were in  Love!\" Could hear shooting; the front line was near by.       Aug. 25, 45: a great breakfast with real coffee.       At 1000 boarded a C-17 plane and flew some 1000 miles over  beautiful mountainous country.      Kunming, China      Toward dark arrived at Kunming, the capital of Yunan Province and the  northern terminus of the Burtq a Road, some 6000 feet above sea level.    Transferred to the 172nd General Hospital for a medical survey. Good  meals! Plenty of food! Soft sheets on the beds! Magazines to read!    Went through many examinations. Had gained 11bs. in 10 days. Wt. 138  lbs.    Aug. 29, 45: Met Col. George Armstrong, the C.O. of the 172nd. I had  known George when we were captains at Walter Reed Army Hospital in the  early thirties. We had a very pleasant visit. (I felt very shabby in  the presence of George's \"spit and polish.\" He later became the  Surgeon General of the Army).       Aug. 30, 45: Discharged from the Hospital. Wrote to Judy, telling  her I would soon be coming home.    Sep. 2, 45: Sunday-V.J. Day. Big Chinese parades; many dragons  occupying the streets; much noise, like the banging of pots and pans.    It was very difficult for our ambulances to get through the streets to  the Kunming airport.    Sept. 3, 45: We boarded a big Douglas C-54. About 2100 in a rain  storm, we took off into the Wild Black Yonder. When it would  lightning, we could see mountains on every side, the Himalaya Range.  We circled up and up, to get out of the cup.    Sept. 4, 45: The Philippines! Near daybreak we came down low so we  could see the badly damaged barracks of Topside of Corregidor, and  soon landed at Nichol's Field-near my Garden Court home of 1940-41.  (Parangue).    We were driven to 29th Reple Depot (a tent city in Los Banos. There  were letters from Judy, mother and sister Ruth, the first in many  months-all thrilled that I was coming home. It was good to learn that  things were normal back home.                         Generals Liberated from Mukden.      While we were waiting transportation home, the generals were flown  from Mukden to Yokohama, Japan-to be greeted by General MacArthur.    On September 2, 1945, on the deck of the U.S. Battleship Missouri in  Tokyo Bay, Generals Jonathan Wainwright and Sir Arthur Percival stood  behind General MacArthur as he accepted the Surrender of the Japanese  Empire. The following day, General Wainwright was flown to Baguio on  Northern Luzon, to accept the surrender of the Philippines from  Japanese General Tomoyuki Yamashita in the High Commissioner's Mansion  at Camp John Hay, ending World War II.    Sept. 5, 45 - Wednesday: Many papers filled out. In the afternoon I  was taken for a ride through Manila. Many of the buildings along Taft  and Dewey Blvds. were in shambles. There were some two hundred damaged  ships in the harbor, many assuming bizarre positions.    Sept. 6, 45 - Thursday: Mother's birthday and I had no way to  communicate with her. Edna Miller, a former school teacher at Brent  School in Baguio, near Camp John Hay, called. She and her boy friend,  Col. Jim Darrah, took me for a ride and dinner. Manila was a wreck!    Sept. 7, 45: I was able to make arrangements to obtain a small Army  plane to fly back to Cabanatuan to look for the sketches I had buried  there.    Sept. 8, 45: Lt. George Armstrong, from Utah, picked me up at 0800 and  flew me in a Piper Cub to Cabanatuan, landing on an airport we POWs  had built by hand - rock by rock (See poem, \"The Pilot,\" by Gen.  Brougher).    All of the prison camp buildings made of wood and swali were gone. I  found where building #12 had been and dug in the area I had buried the  drawings, but found nothing. The U.S. Army Engineers at the airport  furnished a bulldozer, and still we found nothing. Arrived back at  Reple Depot 29 about 1700 hours to find more letters from Judy, Mother  and Ruth."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8452"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 363, December 16, 1882 (#20)"],[1," applicable to serpentine, as the clefts are never of any great depth,  and the five feet before mentioned are a proportionately great depth  from the surface. As I mentioned in commencing this paper (Part I),  every part of the success of a trip lies in knowing where to find the  minerals sought; and by close observation of these relations much more  direction may be obtained than by my trying to describe the exact point  in a locality where I have obtained them or seen them. There is much  more satisfaction in finding rich pockets independently of direction,  and by close observance of indications rather than chance, or by having  them pointed out; for the one that reads this, and goes ahead of you to  the spot, and either destroys the remainder by promiscuous cuttings, or  carries them off in bulk, as there are many who go to a locality, and  what they cannot carry off they destroy, give you a disappointment in  finding nothing; consequently, I have considered that this digression  from our subject in detail was pardonable, that one may be independent  of the stated parts of the locality, and not too confidently rely on  them, as I am sometimes disappointed myself in localities and pockets  that I discover in spare time by finding that some one has been there  between times, and carried off the remainder. The characteristics of  magnesite I have detailed under that head under Pavilion Hill, Staten  Island; but it may be well to repeat them briefly here. Form as above  described, from a white to darker dirty color. Specific gravity, 2.8-3;  hardness, about 3.5. Before the blowpipe it is infusible, _and not  reduced to quicklime_, which distinguishes it from dolomite, which it  frequently resembles in the latter's massive form, common here in veins.  It dissolves in acid readily with but little effervescence, which  little, however, distinguishes it from brucite, which it sometimes  resembles and which has a much lower-specific gravity when pure.    _Dolomite_.--This mineral has been very common in this locality.  It differs, perhaps, as I have before explained, from magnesite in  containing lime besides magnesia, and from calc spar by the _vice  versa_. Much of the magnesite in this serpentine contains more or less  lime, and is consequently in places almost pure dolomite, although  crystals are seldom to be found in this outcrop, it all occurring as  veins about a half-inch thick and resembling somewhat the gurhofite  of Staten Island, only that it is softer and less homogeneous in  appearance. Its color is slightly tinged green, and specimens of it are  not peculiarly unique, but perhaps worth removing. Its characteristics  are: first, its burning to quicklime before the blowpipe, distinguishing  it from pure magnesite; second, its slow effervescence in acids. Besides  these, its specific gravity is 2.8, hardness, 8.5; from calcspar it  cannot be distinguished except by chemical analysis, as the two species  blend almost completely with every intermediate stage of composition  into either calc spar, or, what occurs in this locality, aragonite,  similar in composition to it, or dolomite. The color of the last,  however, is generally darker, and it cleaves less readily into its  crystalline form, which is similar to calc spar, and of which it is  harder, 3.5 to 3 of calc spar.    _Aragonite_.--This mineral, identical in composition with calc spar, but  whose crystalline form is entirely different, occurs in this locality in  veins hardly recognizable from the magnesite or dolomite, and running  into dolomite. It is not abundant, and the veins are limited in extent;  the only distinguishment it has from the dolomite, practically, is its  fibrous structure, the fibers being brittle and very coarse. If examined  with a powerful glass, they will be seen to be made up of modified long  prisms. The specific gravity is over 2.9, hardness about 4, unless much  weathered, when it becomes apparently less. There are some small veins  at the north end of the walk, and in them excellent forms may be found  by cutting into the veins.    _Brucite_.--This mineral occurs here in fair abundance, it being one of  the principal localities for it in the United States, and where formerly  extremely unique specimens were to be obtained. It has been pretty well  exhausted, however, and the fine specimens are only to be obtained by  digging into the veins of it in the rock, which are quite abundant on  the south end of the walk, and, as I before noted, as deep as possible  from the top of the veins, as it is a closely packed mineral not  occurring in geodes, druses, etc. Two forms of it occur; the one,  nemalite, is in fibers of a white to brown color resembling asbestos,  but the fibers are brittle, and hardly as fine as a typical asbestos. It  is packed in masses resembling the brucite, from which it only differs  in breaking into fibers instead of plates, as I have explained in my  description of that species (see Part II). They are both readily soluble  in acids, with effervescence, and infusible but crumble to powder before  the blowpipe, or at least become brittle; when rubbed in mass with a  piece of iron, they phosphoresce with a yellow light; specific gravity,  2.4, hardness, 1.5 to 2. Its ready solubility in acids without  effervescence at once distinguishes it from any mineral that it may  resemble. The specimens of nemalite may be more readily obtained than  the brucite but fine specimens of both may be obtained after finding a  vein of it, by cutting away the rock, which is not hard to do, as it  is in layers and masses packed together, and which maybe wedged out in  large masses at a time with the cold chisel and hammer, perhaps at the  rate of three or four cubic feet an hour for the first hour, and in  rapidly decreasing rate as progress is made toward the unweathered rock  and untouched brucite, etc.    _Serpentine_.--Fair specimens of this may be obtained of a dark oil  green color, but not translucent or peculiarly perfect forms. The  variety known as marmolite, which splits into thin leaves, is plentiful  and often well worth removing.    _Chromic Iron_.--Crystals of this are included in the denser rock  in great abundance; they are very small, seldom over a few lines  in diameter, of an iron black color, of a regular octahedral form;  sometimes large crystals may be found in place or in the disintegrated  loose rock. I have seen them a half inch in diameter, and a half dozen  in a small mass, thus forming an excellent cabinet specimen. By finding  out by observation where they are the thickest in the rock, and cutting  in at this point, more or less fine crystals may be obtained. This is  readily found where they are so very abundant, near the equidistant  points of the walk, that no difficulty should be encountered in so  doing. These characteristics are interesting, and if large specimens  cannot be obtained, any quantity of the small crystals may be split out,  and, as a group, used for a representative at least. Before the blowpipe  it is infusible, but if powdered, it slowly dissolves in the molten  borax bead and yields a beautiful green globule. The specific gravity,  which is generally unattainable, is about 4.5, and hardness 5 to 6. Its  powder or small fragments are attracted by the magnet. A few small veins  of this mineral are also to be found horizontally in the rock, and  small masses may be obtained. They are very rare, however. I have seen  numerous agates from this locality, but have not found them there  myself. They may be looked for in the loose earth over the outcrop, or  along the wall of the river. Our next locality is Paterson, N. J., or  rather in a trip first to West Paterson by the D.L. & W. Railroad,  Boonton branch, then back to Paterson proper, which is but a short  distance, and then home by the Erie road, or, if an excursion ticket has  been bought, on the D.L. & W, back from West Paterson. Garret Rock holds  the minerals of Paterson, and although they are few in number, are very  unique. The first is phrenite. This beautiful mineral occurs in  geodes, or veins of them, near the surface of the basalt, which is the  characteristic formation here, and lies on the red sandstone.    These veins are but two or three feet from the surface, and the ones  from which the fine specimens are to be and have been obtained are  exposed by the railroad cutting about a thousand feet north of the  station at West Paterson, and on the west side of the rails. Near or  below the beds is a small pile of debris, prominent by being the only  one in the vicinity near the rails. In this loose rock and the veins  which are by this description readily found and identified, they are  about three inches in thickness, and in some places widen out into  pockets even a foot in diameter They look like seams of a dark earth,  with blotches of white or green matter where they are weathered, but are  fresher in appearance inside. The rock, in the immediate vicinity of the  veins, is soft, and may be readily broken out with the hammer of, if  possible, a pick bar, and thus some of these geode cavities broken into,  and much finer specimens obtained than in the vein proper. Considerable  occurs scattered about in the before-mentioned pile of loose rock and  debris, and if one does not prize it sufficiently to cut into the rock,  taking the chances of lucky find, plenty may be obtained thus; but as  it has been pretty thoroughly picked over where loose, it is much more  satisfactory to obtain the fine specimens in place in the rock. When  the bed for the railroad was being cut here, many fine specimens were  obtained by those in the vicinity, and the natives of the place have it  in abundance, and it may be obtained from many of them for a trifle, if  one is not inclined to work it out. The mineral itself occurs in masses  in the vein of a white, greenish white, or more or less dark green  color. Sometimes"]]]
