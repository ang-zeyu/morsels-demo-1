[Footnote:  In a letter to the Secretary of the Navy (\"Captains' Letters.\"  1812. ii, No. 85), Hull, after speaking of the way his men were  arriving, says: \"The crew are as yet unacquainted with a ship of  war, as many have but lately joined and have never been on an  armed ship before. * * * We are doing all that we can to make  them acquainted with their duty, and in a few days we shall have  nothing to fear from any single-decked ship.\"] On the 17th, at  2 P.M., Hull discovered four sail, in the northern board, heading  to the westward. At 3, the wind being very light, the _Constitution_  made sail and tacked, in 18-1/2 fathoms. At 4, in the N. E., a  fifth sail appeared, which afterward proved to be the _Guerrière_,  The first four ships bore N. N. W., and were all on the starboard  tack; while by 6 o'clock the fifth bore E. N. E. At 6.15 the  wind shifted and blew lightly from the south, bringing the American  ship to wind-ward. She then wore round with her head to the  eastward, set her light studding-sails and stay-sails, and at  7.30 beat to action, intending to speak the nearest vessel, the  _Guerrière_. The two frigates neared one another gradually and at  10 the _Constitution_ began making signals, which she continued  for over an hour. At 3.30 A. M. on the 18th the _Guerrière_, going  gradually toward the _Constitution_ on the port tack, and but  one half mile distant, discovered on her lee beam the _Belvidera_  and the other British vessels, and signalled to them. They did  not answer the signals, thinking she must know who they were--a  circumstance which afterward gave rise to sharp recriminations  among the captains--and Dacres, concluding them to be Commodore  Rodgers' squadron, tacked, and then wore round and stood away  from the _Constitution_ for some time before discovering his mistake.    [Illustration: Captain Isaac Hull: a miniature by an unknown artist,  circa 1807-1812. (Courtesy The New-York Historical Society)]    At 5 A. M. Hull had just enough steerage way on to keep his head  to the east, on the starboard tack; on his lee quarter, bearing  N. E. by N., were the _Belvidera_ and _Guerrière_ and astern the  _Shannon_, _Aeolus_, and _Africa_. At 5.30 it fell entirely calm,  and Hull put out his boats to tow the ship, always going southward.  At the same time he whipped up a 24 from the main-deck, and got  the forecastlechaser aft, cutting away the taffrail to give the  two guns more freedom to work in and also running out, through  the cabin windows, two of the long main-deck 24's. The British  boats were towing also. At 6 A. M. a light breeze sprang up, and  the _Constitution_ set studding-sails and stay-sails; the _Shannon_  opened at her with her bow guns, but ceased when she found she  could not reach her. At 6.30, the wind having died away, the  _Shannon_ began to gain, almost all the boats of the squadron  towing her. Having sounded in 26 fathoms, Lieutenant Charles  Morris suggested to Hull to try kedging. All the spare rope was  bent on to the cables, payed out into the cutters, and a kedge  run out half a mile ahead and let go; then the crew clapped on  and walked away with the ship, overrunning and tripping the kedge  as she came up with the end of the line. Meanwhile, fresh lines  and another kedge were carried ahead, and the frigate glided away  from her pursuers. At 7.30 A. M. a little breeze sprang up, when  the _Constitution_ set her ensign and fired a shot at the _Shannon_.  It soon fell calm again and the _Shannon_ neared. At 9.10 a light  air from the southward struck the ship, bringing her to windward.  As the breeze was seen coming, her sails were trimmed, and as soon  as she obeyed her helm she was brought close up on the port tack.  The boats dropped in alongside; those that belonged to the davits  were run up, while the others were just lifted clear of water, by  purchases on the spare spars, stowed outboard, where they could be  used again at a minute's notice. Meanwhile, on her lee beam, the  _Guerrière_ opened fire; but her shot fell short, and the Americans  paid not the slightest heed to it. Soon it again fell calm, when  Hull had 2000 gallons of water started, and again put out his boats  to tow. The _Shannon_ with some of the other boats of the squadron  helping her, gained on the _Constitution_ but by severe exertion  was again left behind. Shortly afterward, a slight wind springing  up, the _Belvidera_ gained on the other British ships, and when it  fell calm she was nearer to the _Constitution_ than any of her  consorts, their boats being put on to her. [Footnote: Cooper speaks  as if this was the _Shannon_; but from Marshall's \"Naval Biography\"  we learn that it was the _Belvidera_. At other times he confuses  the _Belvidera_ with the _Guerrière_. Captain Hull, of course,  could not accurately distinguish the names of his pursuers. My  account is drawn from a careful comparison of Marshall, Cooper,  and James. ] At 10.30, observing the benefit that the _Constitution_  had derived from warping, Captain Byron did the same, bending all  his hawsers to one another, and working two kedge anchors at the  same time by paying the warp out through one hawse-hole as it was  run in through the other opposite. Having men from the other frigates  aboard, and a lighter ship to work, Captain Byron at 2 P. M. was  near enough to exchange bow--and stern-chasers with the  _Constitution_, out of range however. Hull expected to be overtaken,  and made every arrangement to try in such case to disable the  first frigate before her consorts could close. But neither the  _Belvidera_ nor the _Shannon_ dared to tow very near for fear of  having their boats sunk by the American's stern-chasers.    The _Constitution's_ crew showed the most excellent spirit. Officers  and men relieved each other regularly, the former snatching their  rest any where on deck, the latter sleeping at the guns. Gradually  the _Constitution_ drew ahead, but the situation continued most  critical. All through the afternoon the British frigates kept  towing and kedging, being barely out of gunshot. At 3 P. M. a light  breeze sprung up, and blew fitfully at intervals; every puff was  watched closely and taken advantage of to the utmost. At 7 in the  evening the wind almost died out, and for four more weary hours  the worn-out sailors towed and kedged. At 10.45 a little breeze  struck the frigate, when the boats dropped alongside and were  hoisted up, excepting the first cutter. Throughout the night the  wind continued very light, the _Belvidera_ forging ahead till she  was off the _Constitution's_ lee beam; and at 4 A. M., on the  morning of the 19th, she tacked to the eastward, the breeze being  light from the south by east. At 4.20 the _Constitution_ tacked  also; and at 5.15 the _Aeolus_, which had drawn ahead, passed on  the contrary tack. Soon afterward the wind freshened so that  Captain Hull took in his cutter. The _Africa_ was now so far to  leeward as to be almost out of the race; while the five frigates  were all running on the starboard tack with every stitch of canvas  set. At 9 A. M. an American merchant-man hove in sight and bore  down toward the squadron. The _Belvidera_, by way of decoy,  hoisted American colors, when the _Constitution_ hoisted the  British flag, and the merchant vessel hauled off. The breeze  continued light till noon, when Hull found he had dropped the  British frigates well behind; the nearest was the _Belvidera_,  exactly in his wake, bearing W. N. W. 2 1/2 miles distant. The  _Shannon_ was on his lee, bearing N. by W. 1/2 W. distant 3 1/2  miles. The other two frigates were five miles off on the lee quarter.  Soon afterward the breeze freshened, and \"old Ironsides\" drew  slowly ahead from her foes, her sails being watched and tended with  the most consummate skill. At 4 P. M. the breeze again lightened,  but even the _Belvidera_ was now four miles astern and to leeward.  At 6.45 there were indications of a heavy rain squall, which once  more permitted Hull to show that in seamanship he excelled even  the able captains against whom he was pitted. The crew were  stationed and every thing kept fast till the last minute, when  all was clewed up just before the squall struck the ship. The  light canvas was furled, a second reef taken in the mizzen top-sail,  and the ship almost instantly brought under short sail. The British  vessels seeing this began to let go and haul down without waiting  for the wind, and were steering on different tacks when the first  gust struck them. But Hull as soon as he got the weight of the  wind sheeted home, hoisted his fore and main-top gallant sails,  and went off on an easy bowline at the rate of 11 knots. At 7.40  sight was again obtained of the enemy, the squall having passed  to leeward; the _Belvidera_, the nearest vessel, had altered her  bearings two points to leeward, and was a long way astern. Next  came the _Shannon_; the _Guerrière_ and _Aeolus_ were hull down,  and the _Africa_ barely visible. The wind now kept light, shifting  occasionally in a very baffling manner, but the _Constitution_  gained steadily, wetting her sails from the sky-sails to the  courses. At 6 A. M., on the morning of the 20th the pursuers were  almost out of sight; and at 8.15 A. M. they abandoned the chase.  Hull at once stopped to investigate the character of two strange  vessels, but found them to be only Americans; then, at midday,  he stood toward the east, and went into Boston on July 26th.    In this chase Captain Isaac Hull was matched against five British  captains, two of whom, Broke and Byron, were fully equal to any  in their navy; and while the latter showed great perseverance,  good seamanship, and ready imitation, there can be no doubt that  the palm in every way belongs to the cool old Yankee.

Old John, immensely flattered by the personal notoriety implied in this  familiar form of address, answered, with something like a knowing look,  'I should believe you could, sir,' and was turning over in his mind  various forms of eulogium, with the view of selecting one appropriate to  the qualities of his best bed, when his ideas were put to flight by Mr  Chester giving Barnaby the letter, and bidding him make all speed away.    'Speed!' said Barnaby, folding the little packet in his breast, 'Speed!  If you want to see hurry and mystery, come here. Here!'    With that, he put his hand, very much to John Willet's horror, on the  guest's fine broadcloth sleeve, and led him stealthily to the back  window.    'Look down there,' he said softly; 'do you mark how they whisper in each  other's ears; then dance and leap, to make believe they are in sport?  Do you see how they stop for a moment, when they think there is no one  looking, and mutter among themselves again; and then how they roll and  gambol, delighted with the mischief they've been plotting? Look at  'em now. See how they whirl and plunge. And now they stop again, and  whisper, cautiously together--little thinking, mind, how often I have  lain upon the grass and watched them. I say what is it that they plot  and hatch? Do you know?'    'They are only clothes,' returned the guest, 'such as we wear; hanging  on those lines to dry, and fluttering in the wind.'    'Clothes!' echoed Barnaby, looking close into his face, and falling  quickly back. 'Ha ha! Why, how much better to be silly, than as wise  as you! You don't see shadowy people there, like those that live in  sleep--not you. Nor eyes in the knotted panes of glass, nor swift ghosts  when it blows hard, nor do you hear voices in the air, nor see men  stalking in the sky--not you! I lead a merrier life than you, with all  your cleverness. You're the dull men. We're the bright ones. Ha! ha!  I'll not change with you, clever as you are,--not I!'    With that, he waved his hat above his head, and darted off.    'A strange creature, upon my word!' said the guest, pulling out a  handsome box, and taking a pinch of snuff.    'He wants imagination,' said Mr Willet, very slowly, and after a long  silence; 'that's what he wants. I've tried to instil it into him, many  and many's the time; but'--John added this in confidence--'he an't made  for it; that's the fact.'    To record that Mr Chester smiled at John's remark would be little to the  purpose, for he preserved the same conciliatory and pleasant look at all  times. He drew his chair nearer to the fire though, as a kind of hint  that he would prefer to be alone, and John, having no reasonable excuse  for remaining, left him to himself.    Very thoughtful old John Willet was, while the dinner was preparing; and  if his brain were ever less clear at one time than another, it is but  reasonable to suppose that he addled it in no slight degree by shaking  his head so much that day. That Mr Chester, between whom and Mr  Haredale, it was notorious to all the neighbourhood, a deep and bitter  animosity existed, should come down there for the sole purpose, as it  seemed, of seeing him, and should choose the Maypole for their place  of meeting, and should send to him express, were stumbling blocks John  could not overcome. The only resource he had, was to consult the boiler,  and wait impatiently for Barnaby's return.    But Barnaby delayed beyond all precedent. The visitor's dinner was  served, removed, his wine was set, the fire replenished, the hearth  clean swept; the light waned without, it grew dusk, became quite dark,  and still no Barnaby appeared. Yet, though John Willet was full of  wonder and misgiving, his guest sat cross-legged in the easy-chair, to  all appearance as little ruffled in his thoughts as in his dress--the  same calm, easy, cool gentleman, without a care or thought beyond his  golden toothpick.    'Barnaby's late,' John ventured to observe, as he placed a pair of  tarnished candlesticks, some three feet high, upon the table, and  snuffed the lights they held.    'He is rather so,' replied the guest, sipping his wine. 'He will not be  much longer, I dare say.'    John coughed and raked the fire together.    'As your roads bear no very good character, if I may judge from my son's  mishap, though,' said Mr Chester, 'and as I have no fancy to be knocked  on the head--which is not only disconcerting at the moment, but places  one, besides, in a ridiculous position with respect to the people who  chance to pick one up--I shall stop here to-night. I think you said you  had a bed to spare.'    'Such a bed, sir,' returned John Willet; 'ay, such a bed as few, even  of the gentry's houses, own. A fixter here, sir. I've heard say that  bedstead is nigh two hundred years of age. Your noble son--a fine young  gentleman--slept in it last, sir, half a year ago.'    'Upon my life, a recommendation!' said the guest, shrugging his  shoulders and wheeling his chair nearer to the fire. 'See that it be  well aired, Mr Willet, and let a blazing fire be lighted there at once.  This house is something damp and chilly.'    John raked the faggots up again, more from habit than presence of mind,  or any reference to this remark, and was about to withdraw, when a  bounding step was heard upon the stair, and Barnaby came panting in.    'He'll have his foot in the stirrup in an hour's time,' he cried,  advancing. 'He has been riding hard all day--has just come home--but  will be in the saddle again as soon as he has eat and drank, to meet his  loving friend.'    'Was that his message?' asked the visitor, looking up, but without the  smallest discomposure--or at least without the show of any.    'All but the last words,' Barnaby rejoined. 'He meant those. I saw that,  in his face.'    'This for your pains,' said the other, putting money in his hand, and  glancing at him steadfastly.'This for your pains, sharp Barnaby.'    'For Grip, and me, and Hugh, to share among us,' he rejoined, putting  it up, and nodding, as he counted it on his fingers. 'Grip one, me two,  Hugh three; the dog, the goat, the cats--well, we shall spend it pretty  soon, I warn you. Stay.--Look. Do you wise men see nothing there, now?'    He bent eagerly down on one knee, and gazed intently at the smoke, which  was rolling up the chimney in a thick black cloud. John Willet, who  appeared to consider himself particularly and chiefly referred to under  the term wise men, looked that way likewise, and with great solidity of  feature.    'Now, where do they go to, when they spring so fast up there,' asked  Barnaby; 'eh? Why do they tread so closely on each other's heels, and  why are they always in a hurry--which is what you blame me for, when I  only take pattern by these busy folk about me? More of 'em! catching to  each other's skirts; and as fast as they go, others come! What a merry  dance it is! I would that Grip and I could frisk like that!'    'What has he in that basket at his back?' asked the guest after a few  moments, during which Barnaby was still bending down to look higher up  the chimney, and earnestly watching the smoke.    'In this?' he answered, jumping up, before John Willet could  reply--shaking it as he spoke, and stooping his head to listen. 'In  this! What is there here? Tell him!'    'A devil, a devil, a devil!' cried a hoarse voice.    'Here's money!' said Barnaby, chinking it in his hand, 'money for a  treat, Grip!'    'Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!' replied the raven, 'keep up your spirits.  Never say die. Bow, wow, wow!'    Mr Willet, who appeared to entertain strong doubts whether a customer in  a laced coat and fine linen could be supposed to have any acquaintance  even with the existence of such unpolite gentry as the bird claimed  to belong to, took Barnaby off at this juncture, with the view of  preventing any other improper declarations, and quitted the room with  his very best bow.        Chapter 11      There was great news that night for the regular Maypole customers, to  each of whom, as he straggled in to occupy his allotted seat in the  chimney-corner, John, with a most impressive slowness of delivery, and  in an apoplectic whisper, communicated the fact that Mr Chester was  alone in the large room upstairs, and was waiting the arrival of  Mr Geoffrey Haredale, to whom he had sent a letter (doubtless of a  threatening nature) by the hands of Barnaby, then and there present.    For a little knot of smokers and solemn gossips, who had seldom any  new topics of discussion, this was a perfect Godsend. Here was a good,  dark-looking mystery progressing under that very roof--brought home to  the fireside, as it were, and enjoyable without the smallest pains  or trouble. It is extraordinary what a zest and relish it gave to the  drink, and how it heightened the flavour of the tobacco. Every man  smoked his pipe with a face of grave and serious delight, and looked at  his neighbour with a sort of quiet congratulation. Nay, it was felt  to be such a holiday and special night, that, on the motion of little  Solomon Daisy, every man (including John himself) put down his sixpence  for a can of flip, which grateful beverage was brewed with all despatch,  and set down in the midst of them on the brick floor; both that it might  simmer and stew before the fire, and that its fragrant steam, rising  up among them, and mixing with the wreaths of vapour from their pipes,  might shroud them in a delicious atmosphere of their own, and shut  out all the world. The very furniture of the room seemed to mellow and  deepen in its tone; the ceiling and walls looked blacker and more highly  polished, the curtains of a ruddier red; the fire burnt clear and high,  and the crickets in the hearthstone chirped with a more than wonted  satisfaction.    There were present two, however, who showed but little interest in"]]]
