It is still most potent in its evil, grotesque, and barbaric forms, in  Fetichism, Voodooism, Bundooism, Obeahism, and Kahunaism, in the devil  and animal ghost worship of the black races, completely exemplified in  the arts of the Fetich wizard on the Congo; in the \"Uchawi\" of the  Wasequhha mentioned by Stanley; in the marriage customs of the Soudan  devil worshipers; in the practices of the Obeah men and women in the  Caribbees--notably their power in matters of love and business, religion  and war--in Jamaica; in the incantations of the kahuna in Hawaii; and in  the devices of the voodoo or conjure doctor in the southern states; in  the fiendish rites and ceremonies of the red men,--the Hoch-e-ayum of  the Plains Indians, the medicine dances of the Cheyennes and Arapahoes,  the fire dance of the Navajos, the snake dance of the Moquis, the sun  dance of the Sioux, in the myths and tales of the Cherokees; and it  rings in many tribal chants and songs of the East and West.    It lives as well, and thrives luxuriantly, ripe for the full vintage, in  the minds of many people to whom this or that trivial incident or  accident of life is an omen of good or evil fortune with a mysterious  parentage. Its roots strike deep in that strange element in human nature  which dreads whatsoever is weird and uncanny in common experiences, and  sees strange portents and dire chimeras in all that is unexplainable to  the senses. It is made most virile in the desire for knowledge of the  invisible and intangible, that must ever elude the keenest inquiry, a  phase of thought always to be reckoned with when imagination runs riot,  and potent in its effect, though evanescent as a vision the brain  sometimes retains of a dream, and as senseless in the cold light of  reason as Monna Sidonia's invocation at the Witches' Sabbath: (_Romance  of Leonardo da Vinci_, p. 97, MEREJKOWSKI.)      \"Emen Hetan, Emen Hetan, Palu, Baalberi,    Astaroth help us Agora, Agora, Patrisa,    Come and help us.\"      \"Garr-r: Garr-r, up: Don't knock    Your head: We fly: We fly:\"    And who may count himself altogether free from the subtle power of the  old mystery with its fantastic imageries, when the spirit of unrest is  abroad? Who is not moved by it in the awesome stillness of night on the  plains, or in the silence of the mountains or of the somber forest  aisles; in wild winter nights when old tales are told; in fireside  visions as tender memories come and go? And who, when listening to the  echoes of the chambers of the restless sea when deep calleth unto deep,  does not hear amid them some weird and haunting refrain like Leland's  sea song?    \"I saw three witches as the wind blew cold  In a red light to the lee;  Bold they were and overbold  As they sailed over the sea;  Calling for One Two Three;  Calling for One Two Three;  And I think I can hear  It a ringing in my ear,  A-calling for the One, Two, Three.\"    Above all, in its literature does witchcraft exhibit the conclusive  proof of its age, its hydra-headed forms, and its influence in the  intellectual and spiritual development of the races of men.    What of this literature? Count in it all the works that treat of the  subject in its many phases, and its correlatives, and it is limitless, a  literature of all times and all lands.    Christian and pagan gave it place in their religions, dogmas, and  articles of faith and discipline, and in their codes of law; and for  four hundred years, from the appeal of Pope John XXII, in 1320, to  extirpate the Devil-worshipers, to the repeal of the statute of James I  in 1715, the delusion gave point and force to treatises, sermons,  romances, and folk-lore, and invited, nay, compelled, recognition at the  hands of the scientist and legist, the historian, the poet and the  dramatist, the theologian and philosopher.    But the monographic literature of witchcraft, as it is here considered,  is limited, in the opinion of a scholar versed in its lore, to fifteen  hundred titles. There is a mass of unpublished materials in libraries  and archives at home and abroad, and of information as to witchcraft and  the witch trials, accessible in court records, depositions, and current  accounts in public and private collections, all awaiting the coming of  some master hand to transform them into an exhaustive history of the  most grievous of human superstitions.    To this day, there has been no thorough investigation or complete  analysis of the history of the witch persecutions. The true story has  been distorted by partisanship and ignorance, and left to exploitation  by the romancer, the empiric, and the sciolist.    \"Of the origin and nature of the delusion we know perhaps enough; but of  the causes and paths of its spread, of the extent of its ravages, of its  exact bearing upon the intellectual and religious freedom of its times,  of the soul-stirring details of the costly struggle by which it was  overborne we are lamentably ill informed.\" (_The Literature of  Witchcraft_, p. 66, BURR.)    It must serve in this brief narrative to merely note, within the  centuries which marked the climax of the mania, some of the most  authoritative and influential works in giving strength to its evil  purpose and the modes of accusation, trial, and punishment.    Modern scholarship holds that witchcraft, with the Devil as the arch  enemy of mankind for its cornerstone, was first exploited by the  Dominicans of the Inquisition. They blazed the tortuous way for the  scholastic theology which in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries  gave new recognition to Satan and his satellites as the sworn enemies of  God and his church, and the Holy Inquisition with its massive enginery,  open and secret, turned its attention to the exposure and extirpation of  the heretics and sinners who were enlisted in the Devil's service.    Take for adequate illustration these standard authorities in the early  periods of the widespread and virulent epidemic:    Those of the Inquisitor General, Eymeric, in 1359, entitled _Tractatus  contra daemonum_; the Formicarius or Ant Hill of the German Dominican  Nider, 1337; the _De calcatione daemonum_, 1452; the _Flagellum  haereticorum fascinariorum_ of the French Inquisitor Jaquier in 1458; and  the _Fortalitium fidei_ of the Spanish Franciscan Alonso de Spina, in  1459; the famous and infamous manual of arguments and rules of procedure  for the detection and punishment of witches, compiled by the German  Inquisitors Kraemer and Sprenger (Institor) in 1489, buttressed on the  bull of Pope Innocent VIII; (this was the celebrated _Witch Hammer_,  bearing on its title page the significant legend, \"_Not to believe in  witchcraft is the greatest of heresies_\"); the Canon Episcopi; the bulls  of Popes John XXII, 1330, Innocent VIII, 1484, Alexander VI, 1494, Leo  X, 1521, and Adrian VI, 1522; the Decretals of the canon law; the  exorcisms of the Roman and Greek churches, all hinged on scriptural  precedents; the Roman law, the Twelve Tables, and the Justinian Code,  the last three imposing upon the crimes of conjuring, exorcising,  magical arts, offering sacrifices to the injury of one's neighbors,  sorcery, and witchcraft, the penalties of death by torture, fire, or  crucifixion.    Add to these classics some of the later authorities: the _Daemonologie_  of the royal inquisitor James I of England and Scotland, 1597; Mores'  _Antidote to Atheism_; Fuller's _Holy and Profane State_; Granvil's  _Sadducismus Triumphatus_, 1681; _Tryal of Witches at the Assizes for  the County of Suffolk before Sir Matthew Hale, March, 1664_ (London,  1682); Baxter's _Certainty of the World of Spirits_, 1691; Cotton  Mather's _A Discourse on Witchcraft_, 1689, his _Late Memorable  Providences Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions_, 1684, and his  _Wonders of the Invisible World_, 1692; and enough references have been  made to this literature of delusion, to the precedents that seared the  consciences of courts and juries in their sentences of men, women, and  children to death by the rack, the wheel, the stake, and the gallows.    Where in history are the horrors of the curse more graphically told than  in the words of Canon Linden, an eye witness of the demonic deeds at  Trier (Treves) in 1589?    \"And so, from court to court throughout the towns and villages of all  the diocese, scurried special accusers, inquisitors, notaries, jurors,  judges, constables, dragging to trial and torture human beings of both  sexes and burning them in great numbers. Scarcely any of those who were  accused escaped punishment. Nor were there spared even the leading men  in the city of Trier. For the Judge, with two Burgomasters, several  Councilors and Associate Judges, canons of sundry collegiate churches,  parish-priests, rural deans, were swept away in this ruin. So far, at  length, did the madness of the furious populace and of the courts go in  this thirst for blood and booty that there was scarcely anybody who was  not smirched by some suspicion of this crime.    \"Meanwhile notaries, copyists, and innkeepers grew rich. The executioner  rode a blooded horse, like a noble of the court, and went clad in gold  and silver; his wife vied with noble dames in the richness of her array.  The children of those convicted and punished were sent into exile; their  goods were confiscated; plowman and vintner failed.\" (_The Witch  Persecutions_, pp. 13-14, BURR.)    Fanaticism did not rule and ruin without hindrance and remonstrance. Men  of great learning and exalted position struck mighty blows at the root  of the evil. They could not turn the tide but they stemmed it, and their  attacks upon the whole theory of Satanic power and the methods of  persecution were potent in the reaction to humanity and a reign of  reason.

But we do not notice the turbot, sole, and  many other varieties, which became familiar in the next generation  or so. The turbot and sole are indeed included in the \"Treatise on  Utensils\" of Neckam, as are likewise the lamprey (of which King John  is said to have been very fond), bleak, gudgeon, conger, plaice,  limpet, ray, and mackerel.    The fifteenth century, if I may judge from a vocabulary of that date  in Wright's collection, acquired a much larger choice of fish, and  some of the names approximate more nearly to those in modern use. We  meet with the sturgeon, the whiting, the roach, the miller's thumb,  the thomback, the codling, the perch, the gudgeon, the turbot, the  pike, the tench, and the haddock. It is worth noticing also that  a distinction was now drawn between the fisherman and the  fishmonger--the man who caught the fish and he who sold it--_piscator_  and _piscarius_; and in the vocabulary itself the leonine line is  cited: \"Piscator prendit, quod piscarius bene vendit.\"    The whale was considerably brought into requisition for gastronomic  purposes. It was found on the royal table, as well as on that of the  Lord Mayor of London. The cook either roasted it, and served it up on  the spit, or boiled it and sent it in with peas; the tongue and the  tail were favourite parts.    The porpoise, however, was brought into the hall whole, and was carved  or _under-tranched_ by the officer in attendance. It was eaten with  mustard. The _piece de resistance_ at a banquet which Wolsey gave  to some of his official acquaintances in 1509, was a young porpoise,  which had cost eight shillings; it was on the same occasion that His  Eminence partook of strawberries and cream, perhaps; he is reported to  have been the person who made that pleasant combination fashionable.  The grampus, or sea-wolf, was another article of food which bears  testimony to the coarse palate of the early Englishman, and at  the same time may afford a clue to the partiality for disguising  condiments and spices. But it appears from an entry in his Privy Purse  Expenses, under September 8, 1498, that Henry the Seventh thought a  porpoise a valuable commodity and a fit dish for an ambassador, for on  that date twenty-one shillings were paid to Cardinal Morton's servant,  who had procured one for some envoy then in London, perhaps the French  representative, who is the recipient of a complimentary gratuity of  L49 10s. on April 12, 1499, at his departure from England.    In the fifteenth century the existing stock of fish for culinary  purposes received, if we may trust the vocabularies, a few accessions;  as, for instance, the bream, the skate, the flounder, and the bake.    In \"Piers of Fulham (14th century),\" we hear of the good store of fat  eels imported into England from the Low Countries, and to be had cheap  by anyone who watched the tides; but the author reprehends the growing  luxury of using the livers of young fish before they were large enough  to be brought to the table.    The most comprehensive catalogue of fish brought to table in the time  of Charles I. is in a pamphlet of 1644, inserted among my \"Fugitive  Tracts,\" 1875; and includes the oyster, which used to be eaten at  breakfast with wine, the crab, lobster, sturgeon, salmon, ling,  flounder, plaice, whiting, sprat, herring, pike, bream, roach, dace,  and eel. The writer states that the sprat and herring were used in  Lent. The sound of the stock-fish, boiled in wort or thin ale till  they were tender, then laid on a cloth and dried, and finally cut into  strips, was thought a good receipt for book-glue.    An acquaintance is in possession of an old cookery-book which exhibits  the gamut of the fish as it lies in the frying-pan, reducing its  supposed lament to musical notation. Here is an ingenious refinement  and a delicate piece of irony, which Walton and Cotton might have  liked to forestall.    The 15th century _Nominale_ enriches the catalogue of dishes then in  vogue. It specifies almond-milk, rice, gruel, fish-broth or soup,  a sort of _fricassee_ of fowl, collops, a pie, a pasty, a tart, a  tartlet, a charlet (minced pork), apple-juice, a dish called jussell  made of eggs and grated bread with seasoning of sage and saffron, and  the three generic heads of sod or boiled, roast, and fried meats. In  addition to the fish-soup, they had wine-soup, water-soup, ale-soup;  and the flawn is reinforced by the _froise_. Instead of one Latin  equivalent for a pudding, it is of moment to record that there are now  three: nor should we overlook the rasher and the sausage. It is  the earliest place where we get some of our familiar articles of  diet--beef, mutton, pork, veal--under their modern names; and about  the same time such terms present themselves as \"a broth,\" \"a browis,\"  \"a pottage,\" \"a mess.\"    Of the dishes which have been specified, the _froise_ corresponded to  an _omelette au lard_ of modern French cookery, having strips of bacon  in it. The tansy was an omelette of another description, made chiefly  with eggs and chopped herbs. As the former was a common dish in the  monasteries, it is not improbable that it was one grateful to the  palate. In Lydgate's \"Story of Thebes,\" a sort of sequel to the  \"Canterbury Tales,\" the pilgrims invite the poet to join the  supper-table, where there were these tasty omelettes: moile, made of  marrow and grated bread, and haggis, which is supposed to be identical  with the Scottish dish so called. Lydgate, who belonged to the  monastery of Bury St. Edmunds, doubtless set on the table at  Canterbury some of the dainties with which he was familiar at home;  and this practice, which runs through all romantic and imaginative  literature, constitutes, in our appreciation, its principal worth.  We love and cherish it for its very sins against chronological and  topographical fitness--its contempt of all unities. Men transferred  local circumstances and a local colouring to their pictures of distant  countries and manners. They argued the unknown from what they saw  under their own eyes. They portrayed to us what, so far as the scenes  and characters of their story went, was undeceivingly false, but what  on the contrary, had it not been so, would never have been unveiled  respecting themselves and their time.    The expenditure on festive occasions seems, from some of the entries  in the \"Northumberland Household Book,\" to present a strong contrast  to the ordinary dietary allowed to the members of a noble and wealthy  household, especially on fish days, in the earlier Tudor era (1512).  The noontide breakfast provided for the Percy establishment was of a  very modest character: my lord and my lady had, for example, a loaf of  bread, two manchets (loaves of finer bread), a quart of beer and one  of wine, two pieces of salt fish, and six baked herrings or a dish  of sprats. My lord Percy and Master Thomas Percy had half a loaf of  household bread, a manchet, a pottle of beer, a dish of butter, a  piece of salt fish, and a dish of sprats or three white herrings; and  the nursery breakfast for my lady Margaret and Master Ingram Percy was  much the same. But on flesh days my lord and lady fared better, for  they had a loaf of bread, two manchets, a quart of beer and the same  of wine, and half a chine of mutton or boiled beef; while the nursery  repast consisted of a manchet, a quart of beer, and three boiled  mutton breasts; and so on: whence it is deducible that in the Percy  family, perhaps in all other great houses, the members and the ladies  and gentlemen in waiting partook of their earliest meal apart in their  respective chambers, and met only at six to dine or sup.    The beer, which was an invariable part of the _menu_, was perhaps  brewed from hops which, according to Harrison elsewhere quoted, were,  after a long discontinuance, again coming into use about this time.  But it would be a light-bodied drink which was allotted to the  consumption at all events of Masters Thomas and Ingram Percy, and  even of my Lady Margaret. It is clearly not irrelevant to my object  to correct the general impression that the great families continued  throughout the year to support the strain which the system of keeping  open house must have involved. For, as Warner has stated, there were  intervals during which the aristocracy permitted themselves to unbend,  and shook off the trammels imposed on them by their social rank and  responsibility. This was known as \"keeping secret house,\" or, in other  words, my lord became for a season incognito, and retired to one of  his remoter properties for relaxation and repose. Our kings in some  measure did the same; for they held their revels only, as a rule, at  stated times and places. William I. is said to have kept his Easter  at Winchester, his Whitsuntide at Westminster, and his Christmas at  Gloucester. Even these antique grandees had to work on some plan. It  could not be all mirth and jollity.    A recital of some of the articles on sale in a baker's or  confectioner's shop in 1563, occurs in Newbery's \"Dives Pragmaticus\":  simnels, buns, cakes, biscuits, comfits, caraways, and cracknels: and  this is the first occurrence of the bun that I have hitherto been able  to detect. The same tract supplies us with a few other items germane  to my subject: figs, almonds, long pepper, dates, prunes, and nutmegs.  It is curious to watch how by degrees the kitchen department was  furnished with articles which nowadays are viewed as the commonest  necessaries of life.    In the 17th century the increased communication with the Continent  made us by degrees larger partakers of the discoveries of foreign  cooks. Noblemen and gentlemen travelling abroad brought back with them  receipts for making the dishes which they had tasted in the course  of their tours.
