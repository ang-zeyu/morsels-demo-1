Your description of the London Zoological Garden, reminds me that  there is, what I suppose I must term, a most beautiful _Zoological  Hill_, just one mile and a half from the spot whence I now write; on  this I often take my recreation, much to the alarm of its inhabitants;  viz. sundry cheetars, bore-butchers, (or leopards) hyenas, wolves,  jackalls, foxes, hares, partridges, etc.; but not being a very capital  shot, I have seldom made much devastation amongst them. Under the hill  are swamps and paddy-fields, which abound in snipe and other game.  Now, is not this a Zoological Garden on the grandest scale?

They now to fight are gone,    Armour on armour shone,    Drumme now to drumme did grone,      To hear was wonder,    That with cryes they make,    The very earth did shake,      Thunder to thunder.      Well it thine age became    O noble Erpingham,    Which didst the signall ayme,      To our hid forces;    When from a meadow by,    Like a storme suddenly,    The English archery      Struck the French horses.

This while oure noble king,    His broad sword brandishing,    Downe the French host did ding,      As to o'erwhelme it.

[The very recent publication of the ninth volume of the Encyclopaedia  Americana[6] enables us to lay before our readers the following  interesting notices, connected with the national weal and internal  economy of the United States of North America.]    _Navy_.--Since the late war, the growth and improvement of our navy  has kept pace with our national prosperity. We could now put to sea,  in a few mouths, with a dozen ships of the line; the most spacious,  efficient, best, and most beautiful constructions that ever traversed  the ocean. This is not merely an American conceit, but an admitted  fact in Europe, where our models are studiously copied. In the United  States, a maximum and uniform calibre of cannon has been lately  determined on and adopted. Instead of the variety of length, form,  and calibre still used in other navies, and almost equal to the Great  Michael with her \"bassils, mynards, hagters, culverings, flings,  falcons, double dogs, and pestilent serpenters,\" our ships offer flush  and uniform decks, sheers free from hills, hollows, and excrescences,  and complete, unbroken batteries of thirty-two or forty-two pounders.  Thus has been realized an important desideratum--the greatest possible  power to do execution coupled with the greatest simplification of the  means.        [6] Philadelphia, Carey and Lea, 1832.    But, while we have thus improved upon the hitherto practised means of  naval warfare, we are threatened with a total change. This is by the  introduction of bombs, discharged horizontally, instead of shot from  common cannon. So certain are those who have turned their attention to  this subject that the change must take place, that, in France, they  are already speculating on the means of excluding these destructive  missiles from a ship's sides, by casing them in a cuirass of iron. Nor  are these ideas the mere offspring of idle speculation. Experiments  have been tried on hulks, by bombs projected horizontally, with  terrible effect. If the projectile lodged in a mast, in exploding it  overturned it, with all its yards and rigging; if in the side, the  ports were opened into each other; or, when near the water, an immense  chasm was opened, causing the vessel to sink immediately. If it should  not explode until it fell spent upon deck, besides doing the injury  of an ordinary ball, it would then burst, scattering smoke, fire, and  death, on every side. When this comes to pass, it would seem that  the naval profession would cease to be very desirable. Nevertheless,  experience has, in all ages, shown that, the more destructive are the  engines used in war, and the more it is improved and systematized, the  less is the loss of life. Salamis and Lepanto can either of them  alone count many times the added victims of the Nile, Trafalgar, and  Navarino.    One effect of the predicted change in naval war, it is said, will be  the substitution of small vessels for the larger ones now in use. The  three decker presents many times the surface of the schooner,  while her superior number of cannon does not confer a commensurate  advantage; for ten bombs, projected into the side of a ship, would be  almost as efficacious to her destruction as a hundred. As forming part  of a system of defence for our coast, the bomb-cannon, mounted on  steamers, which can take their position at will, would be terribly  formidable. With them--to say nothing of torpedoes and submarine  navigation--we need never more be blockaded and annoyed as formerly.  Hence peaceful nations will be most gainers by this change of system;  but it is not enough that we should be capable of raising a blockade:  we are a commercial people: our merchant ships visit every sea, and  our men-of-war must follow and protect them there.    _Newspapers_.--No country has so many newspapers as the United States.

About him then were peace,  prosperity, and security.    Yet, as he stood there, waiting--it came to him: the note of danger.  Swiftly he looked to right and left, trying to penetrate the premature  dusk. The whole complexion of the matter changed. Some menace intangible  now, but which at any moment might become evident--lay near him. It was  sheer intuition, no doubt, but it convinced him.    A moment later he had rung the bell; and as a man opened the door,  showing a easy and well-lighted lobby within, the fear aura no longer  touched Paul Harley. Out from the doorway came hominess and that air  of security and peace which had seemed to characterize the house when  viewed from outside. The focus of menace, therefore, lay not inside  the house of Sir Charles but without. It was very curious. In the next  instant came a possible explanation.    \"Mr. Paul Harley?\" said the butler tentatively.    \"Yes, I am he.\"    \"Sir Charles is expecting you, sir. He apologizes for not being in to  receive you, but he will only be absent a few minutes.\"    \"Sir Charles has been called out?\" inquired Harley as he handed hat and  coat to the man.    \"Yes, sir. He is attending Mr. Chester Wilson on the other side of the  square, and Mr. Wilson's man rang up a few moments ago requesting Sir  Charles to step across.\"    \"I see,\" murmured Harley, as the butler showed him into a small but  well-filled library on the left of the lobby.    Refreshments were set invitingly upon a table beside a deep lounge  chair. But Harley declined the man's request to refresh himself while  waiting and began aimlessly to wander about the room, apparently  studying the titles of the works crowding the bookshelves. As a matter  of fact, he was endeavouring to arrange certain ideas in order, and if  he had been questioned on the subject it is improbable that he could  have mentioned the title of one book in the library.    His mental equipment was of a character too rarely met with in the  profession to which he belonged. While up to the very moment of reaching  Sir Charles's house he had doubted the reality of the menace which  hung over this man, the note of danger which he had sensed at the very  threshold had convinced him, where more ordinary circumstantial evidence  might have left him in doubt.    It was perhaps pure imagination, but experience had taught him that it  was closely allied to clairvoyance.    Now upon his musing there suddenly intruded sounds of a muffled  altercation. That is to say, the speakers, who were evidently in the  lobby beyond the library door, spoke in low tones, perhaps in deference  to the presence of a visitor. Harley was only mildly interested, but  the voices had broken his train of thought, and when presently the door  opened to admit a very neat but rather grim-looking old lady he started,  then looked across at her with a smile.    Some of the grimness faded from the wrinkled old face, and the  housekeeper, for this her appearance proclaimed her to be, bowed in a  queer Victorian fashion which suggested that a curtsy might follow. One  did not follow, however. \"I am sure I apologize, sir,\" she said. \"Benson  did not tell me you had arrived.\"    \"That's quite all right,\" said Harley, genially.    His smile held a hint of amusement, for in the comprehensive glance  which the old lady cast across the library, a glance keen to detect  disorder and from which no speck of dust could hope to conceal itself,  there remained a trace of that grimness which he had detected at the  moment of her entrance. In short, she was still bristling from a recent  encounter. So much so that detecting something sympathetic in Harley's  smile she availed herself of the presence of a badly arranged vase of  flowers to linger and to air her grievances.    \"Servants in these times,\" she informed him, her fingers busily  rearranging the blooms, \"are not what servants were in my young days.\"    \"Unfortunately, that is so,\" Harley agreed.    The old lady tossed her head. \"I do my best,\" she continued, \"but that  girl would not have stayed in the house for one week if I had had my  way. Miss Phil is altogether too soft-hearted. Thank goodness, she goes  to-morrow, though.\"    \"You don't refer to Miss Phil?\" said Harley, intentionally  misunderstanding.    \"Gracious goodness, no!\" exclaimed the housekeeper, and laughed with  simple glee at the joke. \"I mean Jones, the new parlourmaid. When I say  new, they are all new, for none of them stay longer than three months.\"    \"Indeed,\" smiled Harley, who perceived that the old lady was something  of a martinet.    \"Indeed, they don't. Think they are ladies nowadays. Four hours off has  that girl had to-day, although she was out on Wednesday. Then she has  the impudence to allow someone to ring her up here at the house; and  finally I discover her upsetting the table after Benson had laid it and  after I had rearranged it.\"    She glanced indignantly in the direction of the lobby. \"Perhaps one  day,\" she concluded, pathetically, as she walked slowly from the room,  \"we shall find a parlourmaid who is a parlourmaid. Good evening, sir.\"    \"Good evening,\" said Harley, quietly amused to be made the recipient of  these domestic confidences.    He continued to smile for some time after the door had been closed. His  former train of ideas was utterly destroyed, but for this he was not  ungrateful to the housekeeper, since the outstanding disadvantage of  that strange gift resembling prescience was that it sometimes blunted  the purely analytical part of his mind when this should have been at its  keenest. He was now prepared to listen to what Sir Charles had to say  and to judge impartially of its evidential value.    Wandering from side to side of the library, he presently found himself  standing still before the mantelpiece and studying a photograph in  a silver frame which occupied the centre of the shelf. It was the  photograph of an unusually pretty girl; that is to say, of a girl whose  beauty was undeniable, but who belonged to a type widely removed from  that of the ordinary good-looking Englishwoman.    The outline of her face was soft and charming, and there was a  questioning look in her eyes which was alluring and challenging. Her  naive expression was palpably a pose, and her slightly parted lips  promised laughter. She possessed delightfully wavy hair and her neck and  one shoulder, which were bare, had a Grecian purity. Harley discovered  himself to be smiling at the naive lady of the photograph.    \"Presumably 'Miss Phil',\" he said aloud.    He removed his gaze with reluctance from the fascinating picture, and  dropping into the big lounge chair, he lighted a cigarette. He had just  placed the match in an ash tray when he heard Sir Charles's voice in  the lobby, and a moment later Sir Charles himself came hurrying into  the library. His expression was so peculiar that Harley started up  immediately, perceiving that something unusual had happened.    \"My dear Mr. Harley,\" began Sir Charles, \"in the first place pray accept  my apologies--\"    \"None are necessary,\" Harley interrupted. \"Your excellent housekeeper  has entertained me vastly.\"    \"Good, good,\" muttered Sir Charles. \"I am obliged to Mrs. Howett,\" and  it was plainly to be seen that his thoughts were elsewhere. \"But I have  to relate a most inexplicable occurrence--inexplicable unless by some  divine accident the plan has been prevented from maturing.\"    \"What do you mean, Sir Charles?\"    \"I was called ten minutes ago by someone purporting to be the servant  of Mr. Chester Wilson, that friend and neighbour whom I have been  attending.\"    \"So your butler informed me.\"    \"My dear sir,\" cried Sir Charles, and the expression in his eyes grew  almost wild, \"no one in Wilson's house knew anything about the matter!\"    \"What! It was a ruse?\"    \"Palpably a ruse to get me away from home.\"    Harley dropped his cigarette into the ash tray beside the match, where,  smouldering, it sent up a gray spiral into the air of the library.  Whether because of his words or because of the presence of the man  himself, the warning, intuitive finger had again touched Paul Harley.  \"You saw or heard nothing on your way across the square to suggest that  any one having designs on your safety was watching you?\"    \"Nothing. I searched the shadows most particularly on my return journey,  of course. For the thing cannot have been purposeless.\"    \"I quite agree with you,\" said Paul Harley, quietly.    Between the promptings of that uncanny sixth sense of his and the  working of the trained deductive reasoning powers, he was momentarily  at a loss. Some fact, some episode, a memory, was clamouring for  recognition, while the intuitive, subconscious voice whispered: \"This  man is in danger; protect him.\" What was the meaning of it all? He felt  that a clue lay somewhere outside the reach of his intelligence, and a  sort of anger possessed him because of his impotence to grasp it.    Sir Charles was staring at him in that curiously pathetic way which  he had observed at their earlier interview in Chancery Lane. \"In  any event,\" said his host, \"let us dine: for already I have kept you  waiting.\"    Harley merely bowed, and walking out of the library, entered the cosy  dining room. A dreadful premonition had claimed him as his glance  had met that of Sir Charles--a premonition that this man's days  were numbered. It was uncanny, unnerving; and whereas, at first, the  atmosphere of Sir Charles Abingdon's home had been laden with prosperous  security, now from every side, and even penetrating to the warmly  lighted dining room, came that chilling note of danger.    In crossing the lobby he had not failed to note that there were many  Indian curios in the place which could not well have failed to attract  the attention of a burglar. But that the person who had penetrated to  the house was no common burglar he"]]]
