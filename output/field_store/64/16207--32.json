He  one morning broke his cord, and, the cry being given, the castle gates  were shut, and a chase commenced. After leading his pursuers two or  three times round the ramparts, and knocking over a few children by  bouncing against them, he suffered himself to be caught, and led  quietly back to his quarters, under one of the guns of the fortress.    By degrees the fear of him subsided, and orders having been given to  the sentinels to prevent his escape through the gates, he was left at  liberty to go where he pleased, and a boy was appointed to prevent him  from intruding into the apartments of the officers. His keeper,  however, generally passed his watch in sleeping; and Sai, as the  panther was called, after the royal giver, roamed at large. On one  occasion he found his servant sitting on the step of the door, upright,  but fast asleep, when he lifted his paw, gave him a blow on the side of  his head which laid him flat, and then stood wagging his tail, as if  enjoying the mischief he had committed. He became exceedingly attached  to the governor, and followed him every-where like a dog. His favourite  station was at a window of the sitting-room, which overlooked the whole  town; there, standing on his hind legs, his fore paws resting on the  ledge of the window, and his chin laid between them, he appeared to  amuse himself with what was passing beneath. The children also stood  with him at the window; and one day, finding his presence an  encumbrance, and that they could not get their chairs close, they used  their united efforts to pull him down by the tail. He one morning  missed the governor, who was settling a dispute in the hall, and who,  being surrounded by black people, was hidden from the view of his  favourite. Sai wandered with a dejected look to various parts of the  fortress in search of him; and, while absent on this errand, the  audience ceased, the governor returned to his private rooms, and seated  himself at a table to write. Presently he heard a heavy step coming up  the stairs, and, raising his eyes to the open door, he beheld Sai. At  that moment he gave himself up for lost, for Sai immediately sprang  from the door on to his neck. Instead, however, of devouring him, he  laid his head close to the governor's, rubbed his cheek upon his  shoulder, wagged his tail, and tried to evince his happiness.  Occasionally, however, the panther caused a little alarm to the other  inmates of the castle, and the poor woman who swept the floors, or, to  speak technically, the _pra-pra_ woman, was made ill by her fright. She  was one day sweeping the boards of the great hall with a short broom,  and in an attitude nearly approaching to all-fours, and Sai, who was  hidden under one of the sofas, suddenly leaped upon her back, where he  stood in triumph. She screamed so violently as to summon the other  servants, but they, seeing the panther, as they thought, in the act of  swallowing her, one and all scampered off as quickly as possible; nor  was she released till the governor, who heard the noise, came to her  assistance. Strangers were naturally uncomfortable when they saw so  powerful a beast at perfect liberty, and many were the ridiculous  scenes which took place, they not liking to own their alarm, yet  perfectly unable to retain their composure in his presence.    This interesting animal was well fed twice every day, but never given  any thing with life in it. He stood about two feet high, and was of a  dark yellow colour, thickly spotted with black rosettes, and from the  good feeding and the care taken to clean him, his skin shone like silk.  The expression of his countenance was very animated and good-tempered,  and he was particularly gentle to children; he would lie down on the  mats by their side when they slept, and even the infant shared his  caresses, and remained unhurt. During the period of his residence at  Cape Coast, I was much occupied by making arrangements for my departure  from Africa, but generally visited my future companion every day, and  we, in consequence, became great friends before we sailed. He was  conveyed on board the vessel in a large, wooden cage, thickly barred in  the front with iron. {38} Even this confinement was not deemed a  sufficient protection by the canoe men,[1] who were so alarmed at  taking him from the shore to the vessel, that, in their confusion, they  dropped cage and all into the sea. For a few minutes I gave up my poor  panther as lost, but some sailors jumped into a boat belonging to the  vessel, and dragged him out in safety. The beast himself seemed  completely subdued by his ducking, and as no one dared to open his cage  to dry it, he rolled himself up in one corner, nor roused himself till  after an interval of some days, when he recognised my voice. When I  first spoke, he raised his head, held it on one side, then on the  other, to listen; and when I came fully into his view, he jumped on his  legs, and appeared frantic; he rolled himself over and over, he howled,  he opened his enormous jaws and cried, and seemed as if he would have  torn his cage to pieces. However, as his violence subsided, he  contented himself with thrusting his paws and nose through the bars of  the cage, to receive my caresses.    The greatest treat I could bestow upon my favourite was lavender water.  Mr. Hutchison had told me that, on the way from Ashantee, he drew a  scented handkerchief from his pocket, which was immediately seized on  by the panther, who reduced it to atoms; nor could he venture to open a  bottle of perfume when the animal was near, he was so eager to enjoy  it. I indulged him twice a week by making a cup of stiff paper, pouring  a little lavender water into it, and giving it to him through the bars  of his cage: he would drag it to him with great eagerness, roll himself  over it, nor rest till the smell had evaporated. By this I taught him  to put out his paws without showing his nails, always refusing the  lavender water till he had drawn them back again; and in a short time  he never, on any occasion, protruded his claws when offering me his  paw.    We lay eight weeks in the river Gaboon, where he had plenty of  excellent food, but was never suffered to leave his cage, on account of  the deck being always filled with black strangers, to whom he had a  very decided aversion, although he was perfectly reconciled to white  people. His indignation, however, was constantly excited by the pigs,  when they were suffered to run past his cage; and the sight of one of  the monkeys put him in a complete fury. While at anchor in the  before-mentioned river, an orang-outang (Simia Satyrus) was brought for  sale, and lived three days on board; and I shall never forget the  uncontrollable rage of the one, or the agony of the other, at this  meeting. The orang was about three feet high, and very powerful in  proportion to his size; so that when he fled with extraordinary  rapidity from the panther to the further end of the deck, neither men  nor things remained upright when they opposed his progress: there he  took refuge in a sail, and although generally obedient to the voice of  his master, force was necessary to make him quit the shelter of its  folds. As to the panther, his back rose in an arch, his tail was  elevated and perfectly stiff, his eyes flashed, and, as he howled, he  showed his huge teeth; then, as if forgetting the bars before him, he  tried to spring on the orang, to tear him to atoms. It was long before  he recovered his tranquillity; day and night he appeared to be on the  listen; and the approach of a large monkey we had on board, or the  intrusion of a black man, brought a return of his agitation.    We at length sailed for England, with an ample supply of provisions;  but, unhappily, we were boarded by pirates during the voyage, and  nearly reduced to starvation. My panther must have perished had it not  been for a collection of more than three hundred parrots, with which we  sailed from the river, and which died very fast while we were in the  northwest trades. Sai's allowance was one per diem, but this was so  scanty a pittance that he became ravenous, and had not patience to pick  all the feathers off before he commenced his meal. The consequence was,  that he became very ill, and refused even this small quantity of food.  Those around tried to persuade me that he suffered from the colder  climate; but his dry nose and paw convinced me that he was feverish,  and I had him taken out of his cage; when, instead of jumping about and  enjoying his liberty, he lay down, and rested his head upon my feet. I  then made him three pills, each containing two grains of calomel. The  boy who had the charge of him, and who was much attached to him, held  his jaws open, and I pushed the medicine down his throat. Early the  next morning I went to visit my patient, and found his guard sleeping  in the cage with him; and having administered a further dose to the  invalid, I had the satisfaction of seeing him perfectly cured by the  evening. On the arrival of the vessel in the London Docks, Sai was  taken ashore, and presented to the Duchess of York, who placed him in  Exeter Change, to be taken care of, till she herself went to Oatlands.  He {39} remained there for some weeks, and was suffered to roam about  the greater part of the day without any restraint. On the morning  previous to the Duchess's departure from town, she went to visit her  new pet, played with him, and admired his healthy appearance and gentle  deportment. In the evening, when her Royal Highness' coachman went to  take him away, he was dead, in consequence of an inflammation on his  lungs--_Loudon's Magazine of Natural History._    [1: The panther in these countries is a sacred, or Fetish,      animal; and not only a heavy fine is extorted from those      who kill one, but the Fetish is supposed to revenge his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12888"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 05 (#3)"],[1,"of particular works are now appearing.    The world for Fichte is at bottom a spiritual order, the revelation  of a self-determining ego or reason; hence the science of the ego, or  reason, the _Wissenschaftslehre_, is the key to all knowledge, and we  can understand nature and man only when we have caught the secret  of the self-active ego. Philosophy must, therefore, be  _Wissenschaftslehre_, for in it all natural and mental sciences find  their ultimate roots; they can yield genuine knowledge only when  and in so far as they are based on the principles of the Science of  Knowledge--mere empirical sciences having no real cognitive value.  The ego-principle itself, however, without which there could be no  knowledge, cannot be grasped by the ordinary discursive understanding  with its spatial, temporal, and causal categories. Kant is right: if  we were limited to the scientific intellect, we could never rise above  the conception of a phenomenal order absolutely ruled by the causal  law. But there is another source of knowledge: in an act of inner  vision or intellectual intuition, which is itself an act of freedom,  we become conscious of the universal moral purpose; the law of duty or  the categorical imperative commands us to be free persons. We cannot  refuse to accept this law without abandoning ourselves as persons,  without conceiving ourselves as _things_, or mere products of nature;  the choice of one's philosophy, therefore, depends upon what kind of  man one is--upon one's values, upon one's will. The type of man who  is a slave of things, who cannot raise himself out of the causal  mechanism, who is not free, will never be able to conceive himself  otherwise than as a cog in a wheel. Fichte accepts the ego, or spirit,  as the ultimate and absolute principle, because it alone can give our  life worth and meaning. Thus he grounds his entire philosophy upon a  moral imperative which presents itself to the ego in an inner vision.  He also tells us that we can become immediately aware of the  pure activity of the ego, of our free action, in a similar act of  intellectual intuition. But we cannot know this free act unless we  perform it ourselves; no one can understand the idealistic philosophy  who is not free; hence philosophy begins with an act of freedom--_im  Anfang war die Tat_.    In order that we may rise to free action, opposition is needed, and  this we get in the spatial-temporal world of phenomena, or nature,  which the ego creates for itself in order to have resistance to  overcome. Fichte conceives of nature as \"the material of our duty,\"  as the obstacle against which the ego can exercise its freedom. There  could be no free action without something to act upon, and there could  be no purposive action without a world in which everything happens  according to law; and such a causal world we have in our phenomenal  order, which is the product of the absolute spiritual principle.  By the ego Fichte did not mean the subjective ego, the particular  individual self with all its idiosyncrasies, but the universal ego,  the reason that manifests itself in all conscious individuals as  universal and necessary truth. In his earlier period he did not define  his thought very carefully, but in time the absolute ego came to be  conceived as the principle of all life and consciousness, as  universal life, and ultimately identified with God. His philosophy is,  therefore, not subjective idealism, although it was so misinterpreted,  but objective idealism; nature is not the creation of the particular  individual ego, but the phenomenal expression, or reflection, in the  subject of the universal spiritual principle.    Upon such an idealistic world-view Fichte based the ethical teachings  through which he exercised a lasting influence upon the German people  and the history of human thought. The universal ego is a moral ego,  an ego with an ethical purpose, that realizes itself in nature and in  man; it is, therefore, the vocation of man to obey the voice of duty  and to free himself from the bondage of nature, to be a person, not a  thing, to cooeperate in the realization of the eternal purpose which  is working itself out in the history of humanity, to sacrifice himself  for the ideal of freedom. Every individual has his particular place in  which to labor for the social whole; how to do it, his conscience will  tell him without fail. And so, too, the German people has its peculiar  place in civilization, its unique contribution to make in the struggle  of the human race for the development of free personality. It is  Germany's mission to regain its nationality, in order that it may  take the philosophical leadership in the work of civilization, and to  establish a State based upon personal liberty, a veritable kingdom  of justice, such as has never appeared on earth, which shall realize  freedom based upon the equality of all who bear the human form.    The Fichtean philosophy holds the mirror up to its age. With the  Enlightenment it glorifies reason, the free personality, nationality,  humanity, civilization, and progress; in this regard it expresses the  spirit of all modern philosophy. It goes beyond the _Aufklaerung_ in  emphasizing the living, moving, developing nature of reality; for it,  life and consciousness constitute the essence of things, and universal  life reveals itself in a progressive history of mankind. Moreover,  the dynamic spiritual process cannot be comprehended by conceptual  thought, by the categories of a rationalistic science and philosophy,  but only by itself, by the living experience of a free agent. In the  categorical imperative, and not in logical reasonings, the individual  becomes aware of his destiny; in the sense of duty, the love of truth,  loyalty to country, respect for the rights of man, and reverence for  ideals, spirit speaks to spirit and man glimpses the eternal.    Among the elements in this idealism that appealed to the Romanticists  were its anti-intellectualism, its intuition, the high value it placed  upon the personality, its historical viewpoint, and its faith in the  uniqueness of German culture. They welcomed the _Wissenschaftslehre_  as a valuable ally, and exaggerated those features of it which seemed  to chime with their own views. The ego which Fichte conceives as  universal reason becomes for them the subjective empirical self, the  unique personality, in which the unconscious, spontaneous, impulsive,  instinctive phase constitutes the original element, the more  extravagant among them transforming the rational moral ego into a  romantic ego, an ego full of mystery and caprice, and even a lawless  ego. Such an ego is read into nature; for, filled with occult magic  forces, nature can be understood only by the sympathetic divining  insight of the poetic genius. And so, too, authority and tradition, as  representing the instinctive and historical side of social life, come  into their own again.    Fichte's chief interest was centred upon the ego; nature he regarded  as a product of the absolute ego in the individual consciousness,  intended as a necessary obstacle for the free will. Without opposition  the self cannot act; without overcoming resistance it cannot become  free. In order to make free action possible, to enable the ego to  realize its ends, nature must be what it is, an order ruled by the  iron law of causality. This cheerless conception of nature--which,  however, was not Fichte's last word on the subject, since he afterward  came to conceive it as the revelation of universal life, or the  expression of a pantheistic God--did not attract Romanticism. It was  Schelling, the erstwhile follower and admirer of Fichte, who turned  his attention to the philosophy of nature and so more thoroughly  satisfied the romantic yearnings of the age.    Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling was born at Leonberg, Wuertemberg,  January 27, 1775, the son of a learned clergyman and writer on  theology. He was a precocious child and made rapid progress in his  studies, entering the Theological Seminary at Tuebingen at the age of  fifteen. Between the ages of nineteen and twenty-two he wrote a  number of able treatises in the spirit of the new idealism, and  was recognized as the most talented pupil of Fichte and his best  interpreter. After the completion of his course at the University  (1795), he became the tutor and companion of two young noblemen with  whom he remained for two years (1796-98) at the University of Leipzig,  during which time he devoted himself to the study of mathematics,  physics, and medicine, and published a number of philosophical  articles. In 1798 he received a call to a professorship at Jena, where  Fichte, Schiller, Wilhelm Schlegel, and Hegel became his colleagues,  and where he entered into friendly relations with the Romantic circle  of which Caroline Schlegel, who afterward became his wife, was a  shining light. This was the most productive period of his life; during  the next few years he developed his own system of philosophy and  gave to the world his most brilliant writings. In 1803 he accepted  a professorship at Wuerzburg, but came into conflict with the  authorities; in 1806 he went to Munich as a member of the Academy of  Sciences and Director of the Academy of Fine Arts; in 1820 he moved to  Erlangen; and in 1827 he returned to Munich as professor of philosophy  at the newly-established University and as General Curator of the  Scientific Collections of the State. He was called to Berlin in 1841  to help counteract the influence of the Hegelian Philosophy, but met  with little success. He died in 1854.    The earlier writings of Schelling either reproduced the thoughts of  the _Wissenschaftslehre_ or developed them in the Fichtean spirit.  Among those of the latter class we note: _Ideas for a Philosophy of  Nature_, 1797; _On the World-Soul_, 1798; _System of Transcendental  Idealism_, 1800. During the second"]]]
