Rub  these together thoroughly with yolks. Make little balls of this paste  the size of the yolks. Fit one ball into each pair whites.      NUT AND CHEESE RELISH    Mix one package cream cheese with one cup of chopped nut meats, one  teaspoon of chopped parsley, two tablespoons of whipped cream, salt and  red pepper. Roll into balls and serve cold, garnished with parsley and  chopped nuts.      GRAPE-FRUIT COCKTAIL    Cut the grape-fruit into halves, crosswise, and scoop out the pulp,  rejecting the white inner skin as well as the seeds. Clean the shells;  cut the edges with a sharp knife into scallops and throw them into cold  water. Set the pulp on the ice. At serving time put a teaspoon of  cracked ice in the bottom of each shell; fill with the pulp, mixed  thoroughly with powdered sugar and a little sherry, if desired; and  place a maraschino cherry or bit of bright-colored jelly in the centre  of each. Lay on paper doilies or surround with bits of asparagus fern.      AMBROSIA    Fill glass with alternate layers of sliced orange and cocoanut; cover  with powdered sugar and place a maraschino cherry on the top of each.      PEACH COCKTAIL    Fill the glasses with sliced peaches; cover with orange or lemon juice;  sweeten to taste; add a little shaved ice and serve.    Apricot and cherry cocktails may be made in the same way.      RASPBERRY COCKTAIL    Mash a pint of ripe, red currants; strain them through cheesecloth; pour  the juice over a pint of red raspberries and set on the ice to chill. At  serving time sweeten to taste and pour into the glasses, putting one  teaspoon of powdered sugar on the top of each.      PINEAPPLE AND BANANA COCKTAIL    Take equal parts of banana and fresh or canned pineapple; cut into small  cubes and cover with lemon or pineapple juice. Serve in glasses or  orange shells placed on autumn leaves or sprays of green fern.      STRAWBERRY COCKTAIL    Slice five or six large strawberries into each glass and squeeze over  them the juice of an orange. At serving time add one heaping teaspoon of  powdered sugar and one tablespoon of shaved ice.      MUSK MELONS    Cut melon in half, seed and put on ice one hour before serving. When  ready to serve, fill with crushed ice and sprinkle with, powdered sugar.  Allow one-half melon for each person. Very refreshing for summer  luncheons or dinners. For dinner serve before soup.      FILLED LEMONS    Select good-sized lemons; cut off tip to stand the lemon upright; cut  top for cover. Scoop out all the lemon pulp, and put in a bowl; put  shells in a bowl of cold water. For six lemons take one box of boneless  sardines, six anchovies, and two green peppers, cut very fine. Wet with  lemon-juice until moist; fill in shells after wiping dry; insert a  pimento on top; put on cover of lemon; serve on doily with horseradish  and watercress.      RED PEPPER CANAPES    Mix together two chopped hard-boiled eggs, one tablespoon of chopped red  peppers (canned), a saltspoon of salt, a tiny pinch of mustard and two  tablespoons of grated American cheese with sufficient melted butter to  form a paste; spread over the rounds of fried bread and place in a very  hot oven for about three minutes. Serve on a folded napkin, garnished  with watercress.      SALTED PEANUTS    Shell and skin freshly roasted peanuts and proceed as in salting  almonds.      SALTED ALMONDS    Pour boiling water on the almonds; cool and remove the skins; dry  thoroughly and brown in a hot oven, using a half tablespoon of butter or  olive oil (preferably the oil) to each cup of nuts, which must be shaken  frequently. When brown, sprinkle well with salt and spread on paper to  dry and cool.    A still easier way to prepare the nuts is to cook them over the fire,  using a larger quantity of olive oil. As the oil can be saved and used  again, this method is not necessarily extravagant.          *SANDWICHES*      Bread should be twenty-four hours old and cut in thin, even slices. If  fancy forms are desired, shape before spreading with butter. Cream  butter and spread evenly.      ANCHOVY SANDWICHES    Pound the anchovies to a paste and mix with an equal quantity of olives  stoned and finely chopped.      CELERY SANDWICHES    Two cups of chopped celery, two tablespoons of chopped walnuts, two  tablespoons of chopped olives, quarter of a cup of Mayonnaise dressing.  Spread between slices of thin buttered bread.      FISH SANDWICHES    Spread one piece of bread with any kind of cold fish that has been  shredded and mixed with tartar sauce. Then put a lettuce leaf on that  and then a slice of hard-boiled egg that has been dipped in tartar  sauce. Cover with a slice of buttered bread.      NUT AND RAISIN SANDWICHES    Take equal quantities of nuts and raisins; moisten with cream or grape  juice and spread on thin slices of bread.      BROWN BREAD SANDWICHES    Season one cup of cottage cheese with salt, cayenne, and add one pimento  cut in shreds. Cut white and brown bread in finger lengths about one  inch wide. Spread with cheese mixture and place a brown and white slice  together.      CHEESE AND NUT SANDWICHES    Cut thin rounds from rye bread. Spread with the following mixture: take  one cream cheese, rub to a cream, season to taste with salt and paprika,  add one stalk of chopped celery, and one-fourth cup of chopped nut  meats. Spread on buttered bread and place a slice of stuffed olive on  top, in the centre of each piece of bread.      LETTUCE SANDWICHES    Put fresh lettuce leaves, washed and dried, between thin layers of  bread. Spread with Mayonnaise or Boiled Dressing.      OLIVE SANDWICHES    Take either ripe or green olives; remove the seeds; mince and mix  thoroughly with Mayonnaise dressing. Spread between slices of  whole-wheat or graham bread.      SARDINE SANDWICHES    Remove the skin and bones from the sardines. Rub to a paste, adding an  equal quantity of chopped hard-boiled eggs, seasoned with salt, cayenne,  lemon juice or vinegar. Moisten with melted butter and spread between  slices of bread.      DATE AND FIG SANDWICHES    Wash equal quantities of dates and figs; stone the dates; add blanched  almonds in quantity about one-fourth of the entire bulk; then run the  whole mixture through a food chopper. Moisten with orange juice and  press tightly into baking-powder tins. When ready to use, dip the box in  hot water; turn out the mixture; slice and place between thin slices of  buttered bread.      FIG SANDWICHES    Remove the stems and chop the figs fine. Put in a double boiler with a  little water and cook until a paste is formed. Add a few drops of lemon  juice; set aside; when cool spread on thin slices of buttered bread.      EGG SANDWICHES    Hard boil the eggs, place them immediately into cold water. When cold;  remove the shells carefully, cut the eggs in half lengthwise and butter  slightly. Lay one or two sardellen or appetite silds on one half of the  egg and press the one half gently on the other half which has the  sardellen. The egg must appear whole. Now tie lengthwise and across with  the narrowest, various colored ribbons you can find.      CHESTNUT SANDWICHES    One slice each of white and brown bread, cut thin and buttered, and  spread with chestnuts that have been boiled tender, peeled and rubbed  through a sieve, then mashed with hard-boiled eggs to a paste and  moistened with Mayonnaise.      SALMON AND BROWN BREAD SANDWICHES    Flake one cup salmon and rub it to a paste. Add mustard, salt, and  cayenne. Spread on the bread, cover with a layer of thin slices of  cucumber, then another piece of bread, press lightly and arrange with  sprigs of parsley on the platter.      WHITE AND BROWN BREAD SANDWICHES    If a novel sandwich is wanted, butter alternate slices of brown and  white bread and pile them one above the other in a loaf. Cut the new  loaf across the slices, butter them and pile them so that when this  second loaf is cut, the slices will be in white and brown blocks. Press  the slices very closely together before cutting at all.      TOASTED CHEESE SANDWICHES    The filling for the toasted cheese sandwiches calls for a cup of soft,  mild cheese, finely cut, and stirred over the fire with a tablespoon of  butter until the cheese is melted. Enough milk to moisten, perhaps not  more than one-eighth of a cup, is then added, with salt, mustard, and  paprika to taste, and the whole is stirred until creamy and smooth.  Slices of bread are very thinly buttered, the cheese mixture spread on  generously, each slice covered with another slice, and set away until  the filling cools and hardens, when the sandwiches are toasted on both  sides and served hot.      POACHED EGG SANDWICHES    Slice as many pieces of bread, from a round loaf, as you have persons to  serve. Toast these slices and let cool. Across each slice place three  strips of pimentoes (use the canned pimentoes), on top of that place a  cold poached egg, put a teaspoon of Mayonnaise on the top of the egg and  sprigs of watercress encircling the toast.      MUSTARD SARDINE PASTE FOR SANDWICHES    Take one box of mustard sardines; bone and mash; add to the mixture one  tablespoon of tomato catsup, one teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, juice  of one lemon, a pinch of cayenne pepper, as much white pepper as will  cover the end of a knife, two tablespoons of vinegar, and one tablespoon  of olive oil. Mix thoroughly until it becomes a paste. Then spread on  thinly cut bread for sandwiches.      CAVIAR AND SALMON SANDWICHES    Take a piece of rye bread, cut round (with a biscuit cutter), spread  with mustard; put some caviar in centre of the bread, strips of smoked  salmon around the caviar and strips of pickle around the salmon.      RIBBON SANDWICHES    Cut two, slices of white bread and two of brown.

The book is, in a sense, a cross-section  of the entire spiritual world. It depicts the necessary unfolding of  typical phases of the spiritual life of mankind. Logical categories,  scientific laws, historical epochs, literary tendencies, religious  processes, social, moral, and artistic institutions, all exemplify the  same onward movement through a union of opposites. There is eternal and  total instability everywhere. But this unrest and instability is of a  necessary and uniform nature, according to the one eternally fixed  principle which renders the universe as a whole organic and orderly.    Organic Wholeness! This phrase contains the rationale of the restless  flow and the evanescent being of the Hegelian world. It is but from the  point of view of the whole that its countless conflicts, discrepancies,  and contradictions can be understood. As the members of the body find  only in the body as a whole their _raison d'etre_, so the manifold  expressions of the world are the expressions of one organism. A hand  which is cut off, as Hegel somewhere remarks, still looks like a hand,  and exists; but it is not a real hand. Similarly any part of the world,  severed from its connection with the whole, any isolated historical  event, any one religious view, any particular scientific explanation,  any single social body, any mere individual person, is like an amputated  bodily organ. Hegel's view of the world as organic depends upon  exhibiting the partial and abstract nature of other views. In his  _Phenomenology_ a variety of interpretations of the world and of the  meaning and destiny of life are scrutinized as to their adequacy and  concreteness. When not challenged, the point of view of common sense,  for instance, seems concrete and natural. The reaction of common sense  to the world is direct and practical, it has few questions to ask, and  philosophic speculations appear to it abstract and barren. But, upon  analysis, it is the common sense view that stands revealed as abstract  and barren. For an abstract object is one that does not fully correspond  to the rich and manifold reality; it is incomplete and one-sided.    Precisely such an object is the world of common sense. Its concreteness  is ignorance. There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt  of by common sense. Its work-a-day world is not even a faint reflex of  the vast and complex universe. It sees but the immediate, the obvious,  the superficial. So instead of being concrete, it is, in truth, the very  opposite. Nor is empirical science with its predilection for \"facts\"  better off. Every science able to cope with a mere fragmentary aspect of  the world and from a partial point of view, is forced to ignore much of  the concrete content of even its own realm. Likewise, art and religion,  though in their views more synthetic and therefore more concrete, are  one-sided; they seek to satisfy special needs. Philosophy  alone--Hegelian philosophy--is concrete. Its aim is to interpret the  world in its entirety and complexity, its ideal is to harmonize the  demands of common sense, the interests of science, the appeal of art,  and the longing of religion into one coherent whole. This view of  philosophy, because it deals with the universe in its fulness and  variety, alone can make claim to real concreteness. Nor are the other  views false. They form for Hegel the necessary rungs on the ladder which  leads up to his own philosophic vision. Thus the Hegelian vision is  itself an organic process, including all other interpretations of life  and of the world as its necessary phases. In the immanent unfolding of  the Hegelian view is epitomized the onward march and the organic unity  of the World-Spirit itself.    The technical formulation of this view is contained in his _Logic_.  This book may indeed be said to be Hegel's master-stroke. Nothing less  is attempted in it than the proof that the very process of reasoning  manifests the same principle of evolution through a union of opposites.  Hegel was well aware, as much as recent exponents of anti-intellectualism,  that through \"static\" concepts we transmute and falsify the \"fluent\"  reality. As Professor James says \"The essence of life is its continuously  changing character; but our concepts are all discontinuous and  fixed ... When we conceptualize we cut out and fix, and exclude everything  but what we have fixed. A concept means a _that-and-no-other_.\" But are  our concepts static, fixed, and discontinuous? What if the very  concepts we employ in reasoning should exemplify the universal flow of  life? Hegel finds that indeed to be the case. Concepts we daily use,  such as quality and quantity, essence and phenomenon, appearance and  reality, matter and force, cause and effect, are not fixed and  isolated entities, but form a continuous system of interdependent  elements. Stated dogmatically the meaning is this: As concavity and  convexity are inseparably connected, though one is the very opposite  of the other--as one cannot, so to speak, live without the other, both  being always found in union--so can no concept be discovered that is  not thus wedded to its contradiction. Every concept develops, upon  analysis, a stubbornly negative mate. No concept is statable or  definable without its opposite; one involves the other. One cannot  speak of motion without implying rest; one cannot mention the finite  without at the same time referring to the infinite; one cannot define  cause without explicitly defining effect. Not only is this true, but  concepts, when applied, reveal perpetual oscillation. Take the terms  \"north\" and \"south.\" The mention of the north pole, for example,  implies at once the south pole also; it can be distinguished only by  contrast with the other, which it thus _includes_. But it is a north  pole only by _excluding_ the south pole from itself--by being itself  and not merely what the other is not. The situation is paradoxical  enough: Each aspect--the negative or the positive--of anything appears  to exclude the other, while each requires its own other for its very  definition and expression. It needs the other, and yet is independent  of it. How Hegel proves this of all concepts, cannot here be shown.  The result is that no concept can be taken by itself as a  \"that-and-no-other.\" It is perpetually accompanied by its \"other\" as  man is by his shadow. The attempt to isolate any logical category and  regard it as fixed and stable thus proves futile. Each category--to  show this is the task of Hegel's _Logic_--is itself an organism, the  result of a process which takes place within its inner constitution.  And all logical categories, inevitably used in describing and  explaining our world, form one system of interdependent and  organically related parts. Hegel begins with an analysis of a concept  that most abstractly describes reality, follows it through its  countless conflicts and contradictions, and finally reaches the  highest category which, including all the foregoing categories in  organic unity, is alone adequate to characterize the universe as an  organism. What these categories are and what Hegel's procedure is in  showing their necessary sequential development, can here not even be  hinted at.    That the logical development of the categories of thought is the same as  the historical evolution of life--and _vice versa_--establishes for  Hegel the identity of thought and reality. In the history of philosophy,  the discrepancy between thought and reality has often been emphasized.  There are those who insist that reality is too vast and too deep for man  with his limited vision to penetrate; others, again, who set only  certain bounds to man's understanding, reality consisting, they hold, of  knowable and unknowable parts; and others still who see in the very  shifts and changes of philosophic and scientific opinion the delusion of  reason and the illusiveness of reality. The history of thought certainly  does present an array of conflicting views concerning the limits of  human reason. But all the contradictions and conflicts of thought prove  to Hegel the sovereignty of reason. The conflicts of reason are its own  necessary processes and expressions. Its dialectic instability is  instability that is peculiar to all reality. Both thought and reality  manifest one nature and one process. Hence reason with its \"dynamic\"  categories can comprehend the \"fluent\" reality, because it is flesh of  its flesh and bone of its bone. Hegel's bold and oft quoted words \"What  is rational is real; and what is real is rational,\" pithily express his  whole doctrine. The nature of rationality and the nature of reality are,  for Hegel, one and the same spiritual process, the organic process of  triumphing over and conquering conflicts and contradictions. Where  reality conforms to this process it is rational (that which does not  conform to it is not reality at all, but has, like an amputated leg,  mere contingent existence); the logical formula of this process is but  an abstract account of what reality is in its essence.    The equation of the real and the rational, or the discovery of one  significant process underlying both life and reason, led Hegel to  proclaim a new kind of logic, so well characterized by Professor Royce  as the \"logic of passion.\" To repeat what has been said above, this  means that categories are related to one another as historical epochs,  as religious processes, as social and moral institutions, nay, as human  passions, wills, and deeds are related to one another. Mutual conflict  and contradiction appear as their sole constant factor amid all their  variable conditions. The introduction of contradiction into logical  concepts as their _sine qua non_ meant indeed a revolutionary departure  from traditional logic. Prior to Hegel, logical reasoning was reasoning  in accordance with "]]]
