After the custard is eaten up, they divide the  cake into as many portions, similar in size and shape, as there are  persons in the company. They then daub over one of these portions with  charcoal until it is perfectly black; they put all the bits of the  cake into a bonnet; when each of the company, blindfolded, draws out a  portion. He who holds the bonnet is entitled to the last bit. Whoever  draws the black piece is the devoted person to be sacrificed to Baal,  whose favour they mean to implore in rendering the season productive.  There is little doubt but that such inhuman sacrifices were once  offered in this country as well as in the east; although the act of  sacrifice is now dispensed with, the devoted person being only  compelled to leap three times through the flames, with which the  ceremony of the festival is closed.    That the Caledonians paid a superstitious respect to the sun, as was  the practice among many other nations, is evident, not only from the  sacrifice of Beltan, but from many other circumstances. When a  Highlander goes to bathe, or to drink water out of a consecrated  fountain, he must always approach by going round the place from east  to west on the south side, in imitation of the apparent diurnal motion  of the sun. When the dead are laid in the earth, the grave is  approached by going round in the same manner. The bride is conducted  to her future spouse in the presence of the minister; and the glass  goes round in company in the course of the sun. This is called in  Gaelic, going round in the right or lucky way; the opposite course is  the wrong or unlucky way.    FHAOLAIN.           *       *       *       *       *      ABORIGINES OF VAN DIEMAN'S LAND.      So little is known of these children of nature, and still less has  been done to gain any knowledge of them, that not much can be offered  as to their present numbers or condition. From what I have seen and  read, the natives of Van Dieman's Land are unlike any other Indians,  either in features, their mode of living, hunting, &c. There are many  hundreds of people who have lived for years in the colony, and yet  have never seen a native. ... The features of these people are any  thing but pleasing: a large flat nose, with immense nostrils; lips  particularly thick; a wide mouth, with a tolerably good set of teeth;  the hair long and woolly, which, as if to confer additional beauty, is  besmeared with red clay (similar to our red ochre) and grease. Their  limbs are badly proportioned; the women appear to be generally better  formed than the men. Their only covering is a few kangaroo skins,  rudely stitched, and thrown over the shoulders; but more frequently  they appear in a state of nudity; indeed, so little knowledge have  they of decency or comfort, that they never avail themselves of the  purposes for which apparel is given to them. Lieut. Collins, in his  account of the natives of New South Wales, describes their marriage  ceremonies as being most barbarous and brutal; and I have also heard  from individuals who have visited New South Wales, that it is not  uncommon to see a poor woman almost beaten to death by her lover,  previous to his marrying her. From the shyness of the natives of Van  Dieman's Land, and the constant warfare that has been carried on  between them and the remote stock-keepers, (which is not likely to  render them more familiar,) I have never been able to ascertain  whether there is any trace of religion among them, or if they have  the slightest idea of a Supreme Being. I believe, and it is generally  supposed, they have not. It is but fair to remark, however, that  nothing has been done for them; the few that can speak a little  English, only curse and swear, and this they catch up very readily  from the different convicts they meet with.           *       *       *       *       *    There are but few instances of any native having entirely forsaken his  tribe, however young he may have been taken away; they appear to  dislike any thing in the shape of labour, although, if they take to  cattle, they are, beyond any thing, quick in tracing and finding those  lost. So acute is their power of discrimination, that they have been  known to trace the footsteps of bush-rangers over mountains and rocks;  and, although the individual they have been in pursuit of has walked  into the sides of the river as if to cross it, to elude the vigilance  of his pursuers, and has swam some distance down and crossed when  convenient, yet nothing can deceive them. Indeed, so remarkable is  their discernment, that if but the slightest piece of moss on a rock  has been disturbed by footsteps, they will instantly detect it. The  aborigines of this island have no appointed place or situation to live  in; they roam about at will, followed by a pack of dogs, of different  sorts and sizes, but which are used principally for hunting the  kangaroo, oppossum, bandicoot, &c. They are passionately fond of their  dogs; so much so, that the females are frequently known to suckle a  favourite puppy instead of the child. They rarely ever move at night,  but encircle themselves round a large fire, and sleep in a sitting  posture, with their heads between their knees. So careless are they of  their children, that it is not uncommon to see boys grown up with feet  exhibiting the loss of a toe or two, having, when infants, been  dropped into the fire by the mother. The children are generally  carried (by the women) astride across the shoulders, in a careless  manner. They live entirely by hunting, and do not fish so much, or use  the canoe, as in New South Wales, although the women are tolerably  expert divers; the craw-fish and oyster, if immediately on the coast,  are their principal food. Oppossums and kangaroos may be said to be  their chief support; the latter is as delicious a treat to an epicure,  as the former is the reverse. The manner of cooking their victuals is  by throwing it on the fire, merely to singe off the hair; they eat  voraciously, and are very little removed from the brute creation as to  choice of food; entrails, &c. sharing the same chance as the choicest  parts. They are extremely expert in climbing, and can reach the top of  the largest forest-trees without the aid of branches; they effect this  by means of a small sharp flint, which they clasp tightly in the ball  of their four fingers, and having cut a notch out of the bark, they  easily ascend, with the large toe of each foot in one notch, and their  curiously manufactured hatchet in the other. Their weapons of defence  are the spear and waddie; the former is about twelve feet long, and as  thick as the little finger of a man; the tea-tree supplies them with  this matchless weapon; they harden one end, which is very sharply  pointed, by burning and filing it with a flint prepared for the  purpose. In throwing the spear they are very expert; indeed, of late,  their audacious atrocities have been lamentably great, although, at  the same time, I have little hesitation in saying, they have arisen  from the cruel treatment experienced by some of their women from the  hands of the distant stock-keepers. Indeed, these poor mortals, I  know, have been shot at merely to gratify a most barbarous cruelty....    After killing a white man, the natives have a sort of dance and  rejoicing, jumping, and singing, and sending forth the strangest  noises ever heard. They do not molest the body when dead, nor have I  ever heard of their stripping or robbing the deceased. Among  themselves they have no funeral rites; and those who are aged or  diseased are left in hollow trees, or under the ledges of rocks, to  pine and die. These people are subject to a disease, which causes the  most loathsome ulcerated sores; two or three whom I saw were  wretched-looking objects. I remember a very old man, who was thus  affected, being tried and hung, for spearing one of Mr. Hart's men;  the culprit was so ill and infirm as to be obliged to be carried to  the place of execution. I think the colonial surgeons call the disease  the \"bush scab;\" and that it is occasioned by a filthy mode of life.  The population of natives is very small in proportion to the extent of  the island: several causes may be alleged for their smallness of  numbers; the principal one is their having been driven about from  place to place, by settlers taking new locations; another cause is the  great destruction of the kangaroo, which obliges the natives to labour  hard to procure food sufficient for their sustenance: this, and their  having no means of procuring vegetables, besides being constantly  exposed to the weather, together with their offensive habits of  living, produce the disease above mentioned, with its fatal  consequences. _Widdowson's Van Dieman's Land_.      Retrospective Gleanings.      OLD ROSE.      Walton, in his \"Angler,\" makes the hunter, in the second chapter,  propose that they shall sing \"Old Rose,\" which is presumed to refer to  the ballad, \"Sing, old Rose, and burn the bellows,\" of which every one  has heard, but much trouble has been taken, in vain, to find a copy of  it.           *       *       *       *       *      AUCTIONS.      Elihu Yale was remarkable for his auctions. The first of these was  about the year 1700. He had brought such quantities of goods from  India, that, finding no one house large enough to stow them in, he had  a public sale of the over-plus; and that was the first auction of the  kind in England.           *       *       *       *       *      LILLY, THE ASTROLOGER.      While this impudent cheat is ridiculed for his absurdities, let him  have credit for as lucky a guess as ever blessed the pages even of  \"Francis Moore, physician.\" In his \"Astrologicall Predictions for  1648,\" there occurs the following passage, in which we must needs  allow that he attained to \"something like prophetic strain,\" when we  call to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11350"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

She started up at the sound of his voice, looked at him,  and then mournfully exclaimed, while she pointed to the ground--\"They have  buried her!\"    \"Then be comforted,\" said Peverell, in a kind and soothing voice; \"your  hardest trial is past.\"    \"What a churl he was!\" continued Madge, not heeding the words of Peverell;  \"I only asked him to keep the grave open till to-morrow, and he denied me!  Only till to-morrow--for then, said I, the cold earth can cover us both.  But he denied me! So I fell upon my knees, beside my Marian's grave, and  prayed that he might never lose a child, to know that blessedness of  sorrow which lies in the thought of soon sleeping with those we have loved  and lost! It was very wrong in me, I know, to wish to call down such  affliction on him--but he denied me--and I had to hear the rattling dust  fall upon her coffin--ay, and to see that dark, deep grave filled up; as  if a mother might not have her own child!\"    \"Poor afflicted creature!\" exclaimed Peverell, in a half whisper to  himself.    \"Yes!\" said Madge, drying her tears with her hands. \"Yes! I have walked  with grief, for my companion in this world, through many a sad and weary  hour. But I shook hands with her, and we parted, at the grave of Marian.  I buried all my troubles there. What is the hour?\"    \"Hard upon two,\" replied Peverell.    \"Then I must be busy,\" replied Madge, in a wild, hurried manner, and  smiling at Peverell, with a look of much importance, as if what she had  to do were some profound secret. \"You'll not betray me, if I tell you?\"  she continued, taking his hand--\"Feel!\" and she placed it on her heart.  \"One, two; one, two; one, two--and so it goes on; it cannot beat beyond  two! Oh, God! in what pain it is before it breaks!\"    She now returned to the chair from which she had risen, at the sound of  Peverell's voice. He approached nearer; and (with a view rather to draw  her gently from her own thoughts, than from any desire that she should  leave his house,) he asked her \"if she would go home?\"    \"Yes,\" she replied; \"bear with me yet a little while, and I'll go. It is  near the time I promised Marian, when last I kissed her wintry cheek, as  she lay shrouded in her coffin; and I may not fail. Lord! Lord! what a  troubled and worthless world this seems to me now! A week ago, and the sun,  and the moon, and the stars, and the green earth, and all that was upon it,  were dear to mine eyes; and I should have wept to look my last at them!  But now, I behold nothing it contains, save my Marian's grave! You will  see _me_ laid in it, for pity's sake--won't you?\"    \"Ay,\" said Peverell, \"but that will be when I am gray, and thinking of my  own: so, cheer up. He that shall toll the bell for thee, now sleeps in his  cradle, I'll warrant.\"    She beckoned Peverell to her, and taking his hand, she again placed it on  her heart. A sad, melancholy smile played for a moment across her pale  wrinkled face, and her glazed eyes kindled into a fleeting expressing of  frightful gladness, as she feebly exclaimed, \"Do you feel? One!--one!--one!  --and hardly that--I breathe only from here,\" she continued, pointing to  her throat. \"Feel!--feel!--one!--one!--another!--how I gasp--see!--see--\"    She ceased to speak; the hand which retained Peverell's relaxed its  hold--her head dropped--one long-drawn sigh was heaved--and poor Madge  resigned a being touched with sympathies and feelings not often found  in natures of nobler quality, in the world's catalogue of nobility. If,  among the thousand doors which death holds open for mortal man to pass  through, ere he puts on immortality, there be one, the rarest of them  all, for broken hearts, this hapless creature found it. A self accusing  spirit bowed her to the earth, with the sharpest of all griefs--a  mother's anguish for an only child--lost to her, as gamesters lose  fortunes--thrown away by her own hand.           *       *       *       *       *      FITZMAURICE THE MAGICIAN.      \"_I have lived three hundred years!_ In that time--in all that time, I  have never seen the glorious sun descend, but followed still its rolling  course through the regions of illimitable space. I have shivered on the  frozen mountains of the icy north, and fainted beneath the sultry skies of  the blazing east: the swift winds have been my viewless chariot, and on  their careering wings I have been hurried from clime to clime. But, nor  light, nor air, nor heat, nor cold, have been to me as to the rest of my  species; for I was doomed to find in their extremes a perpetual torment.  I howled, under the sharp, pinching pangs of the icy north; I panted with  agony, in the scorching fervour of the blazing east; and when mine eyes  have ached, with vain efforts, to pierce the darkness of the earth's  centre, they have been suddenly blasted with excessive and intolerable  delight.    \"All the currents of human affection--all that makes the past delightful,  the present lovely, and the future coveted, were dried up within me. My  heart was like the sands of the desert, parched and barren. No living  stream of hope, of gladness, or of desire, quickened it with human  sympathies. It was a bleak and withered region, the fit abode of  ever-during sorrow and comfortless despair. I was as a blighted tree, that  perishes not at the root, but is withered in all its branches. Tears, I  had none. One gracious drop, falling from my seared orbs, would have been  the blessed channel of pent-up griefs that seemed to crush my almost  frenzied brain. Sighs, I breathed not. They would have heaved from my  bursting heart some of that misery, which loaded it to anguish. Sleep  never came. I was denied the common luxury of the common wretched, to lose,  in its sweet oblivion, its brief forgetfulness, the sense of what I was.  Death, natural death, closed his many doors against me. All that lived,  except myself--the persecuted, the weary, and the heavily laden of man's  race--could find a grave! I, alone, looked upon the earth, and felt that  it had no resting place for me! God! God! what a forlorn and miserable  creature is man, when, in his affliction, he cannot say to the worm, I  shall be yours! I might have cast away, indeed, the YENARKON--the Giver of  Life--the elixir of the Sibyl--but that would have been to subject myself  to a power of darkness, in whose fell wrath I should have suffered the  casting away of mine eternal soul!    \"Thus the stream of time rolled on, burying beneath its dark waves, our  little span of present, in the huge ocean of a perpetual past, and  devouring, as the food of both, our swift decaying future. But I floated  on its surface, and beheld whole generations flourish and fade away, while  age and silver hairs, growing infirmities, and the closing sigh that ends  them all, mocked me with a horrible exemption. I remained, and might have  remained, for ages yet to come, the fixed and unaltered image of what I  was, when in Mauritania I encountered the potent Amaimon, the damned  magician of the den, but for that--woman's faith, and man's  fidelity--which have made me what I AM!    \"This _was_ my destiny. Now mark, how I became enthralled to it; and how  it befell, that at last I shook it off, and found redemption.    \"In my middle manhood, when scarcely forty summers had glowed within my  veins, I left my native Italy, and journeyed to the Holy Land, upon the  strict vow of a self-imposed penance. It was for no sin committed in my  days of youth, but for the satisfaction of an ardent piety, and the  growing spirit of a long enkindled devotion. I had patrimonial wealth in  Apulia; I had kindred; I had friends. I renounced them all, to dedicate  myself, thenceforth, to the service of THE CROSS. My purpose was blessed,  by a virtuous mother's prayers, that I might approve myself a worthy  soldier of Christ; and it was sanctified by a holy priest at the altar.    \"Even now, the recollection is strong within me, of the feelings with  which, as the rising sun illumined the tops of the surrounding hills, I  approached the once glorious, and still sacred, city of Jerusalem--that  chosen seat of the Godhead--that Queen among the nations. Eclipsed, though  it was, and its majestic head trodden into the dust, by the foot of the  infidel, my gladdened eyes dwelt upon what was imperishable, and my wrapt  imagination pictured what was destroyed. The valleys of Jehosaphat and  Gehinnon, Mount Calvary, Mount Zion, and Mount Acre, stretched before me.  The palace of King Herod, with its sumptuous halls of marble and of  gold--the gorgeous Temple of Solomon--the lofty towers of Phaseolus and  Mariamne--the palace of the Maccabees--the Hippodrome--the houses of many  of the prophets--grew into existence again, beneath the creative force of  fancy. I stood and wept. I knelt, and kissed the consecrated earth which  once a Saviour trod.\"           *       *       *       *       *      \"THE HUNTED STAG: A SKETCH.        What sounds are on the mountain blast?
