If you wish your conversation to be  thoroughly agreeable, lead a mother to talk of her children, a young  lady of her last ball, an author of his forthcoming book, or an artist  of his exhibition picture. Having furnished the topic, you need  only listen; and you are sure to be thought not only agreeable, but  thoroughly sensible and well-informed.    Be careful, however, on the other hand, not always to make a point of  talking to persons upon general matters relating to their professions.  To show an interest in their immediate concerns is flattering; but  to converse with them too much about their own arts looks as if you  thought them ignorant of other topics.    Remember in conversation that a voice \"gentle and low\" is, above all  other extraneous acquirements, \"an excellent thing in woman.\" There is  a certain distinct but subdued tone of voice which is peculiar to only  well-bred persons. A loud voice is both disagreeable and vulgar. It is  better to err by the use of too low than too loud a tone.    Remember that all \"slang\" is vulgar. It has become of late  unfortunately prevalent, and we know many ladies who pride themselves  on the saucy _chique_ with which they adopt certain Americanisms,  and other cant phrases of the day. Such habits cannot be too severely  reprehended. They lower the tone of society and the standard of  thought. It is a great mistake to suppose that slang is in any way a  substitute for wit.    The use of proverbs is equally vulgar in conversation; and puns,  unless they rise to the rank of witticisms, are to be scrupulously  avoided. A lady-punster is a most unpleasing phenomenon, and we would  advise no young woman, however witty she may be, to cultivate this  kind of verbal talent.    Long arguments in general company, however entertaining to the  disputants, are tiresome to the last degree to all others. You should  always endeavour to prevent the conversation from dwelling too long  upon one topic.    Religion is a topic which should never be introduced in society. It is  the one subject on which persons are most likely to differ, and least  able to preserve temper.    Never interrupt a person who is speaking. It has been aptly said that  \"if you interrupt a speaker in the middle of his sentence, you act  almost as rudely as if, when walking with a companion, you were to  thrust yourself before him, and stop his progress.\"    To listen well is almost as great an art as to talk well. It is not  enough _only_ to listen. You must endeavour to seem interested in the  conversation of others.    It is considered extremely ill-bred when two persons whisper in  society, or converse in a language with which all present are not  familiar. If you have private matters to discuss, you should appoint  a proper time and place to do so, without paying others the ill  compliment of excluding them from your conversation.    If a foreigner be one of the guests at a small party, and does not  understand English sufficiently to follow what is said, good breeding  demands that the conversation shall be carried on in his own language.  If at a dinner-party, the same rule applies to those at his end of the  table.    If upon the entrance of a visitor you carry on the thread of a  previous conversation, you should briefly recapitulate to him what has  been said before he arrived.    Do not be _always_ witty, even though you should be so happily gifted  as to need the caution. To outshine others on every occasion is the  surest road to unpopularity.    Always look, but never stare, at those with whom you converse.    In order to meet the general needs of conversation in society, it is  necessary that a gentlewoman should be acquainted with the current  news and historical events of at least the last few years.    Never talk upon subjects of which you know nothing, unless it be for  the purpose of acquiring information. Many young ladies imagine that  because they play a little, sing a little, draw a little, and frequent  exhibitions and operas, they are qualified judges of art. No mistake  is more egregious or universal.    Those who introduce anecdotes into their conversation are warned  that these should invariably be \"short, witty, eloquent, new, and not  far-fetched.\"    Scandal is the least excusable of all conversational vulgarities.    In conversing with a woman of rank, do not too frequently give her her  title. Only a lady's-maid interlards every sentence with \"My Lady,\" or  \"My Lord.\" It is, however, well to show that you remember the station  of your interlocutor by now and then introducing some such phrase  as--\"I think I have already mentioned to your Grace\"--or, \"I believe,  Madam, you were observing--\"    A peer or baron may occasionally, as in an address, be styled \"My  Lord,\" but a lady of equal rank must only be addressed as \"Madam.\"  In general, however, a nobleman or lady of high rank should only be  addressed as you would address any other gentleman or lady. The Prince  of Wales himself is only styled \"Sir\" in conversation, and the Queen  \"Madam.\"           *       *       *       *       *    V.--NOTES OF INVITATION, &C.      Notes of invitation and acceptance are written in the third person  and the simplest style. The old-fashioned preliminary of \"presenting  compliments\" is discontinued by the most elegant letter writers.    All notes of invitation are now issued in the name of the mistress of  the house only, as follows:--        \"Mrs. Norman requests the honour of Sir George and Lady      Thurlow's company at an evening party, on Monday, 14th of      June.\"    Others prefer the subjoined form, which is purchaseable ready printed  upon either cards or note paper, with blanks for names or dates:--                         \"Mrs. Norman,                         \"At home,              \"Monday evening, June 14th inst.\"    An \"At home\" is, however, considered somewhat less stately than  an evening party, and partakes more of the character of a  _conversazione_.    The reply to a note of invitation should be couched as follows:--        \"Mr. Berkeley has much pleasure in accepting Mrs. Norman's      polite invitation for Monday evening, June the 14th instant.\"    Never \"avail\" yourself of an invitation. Above all, never speak or  write of an invitation as \"an invite.\" It is neither good breeding nor  good English.    Notes of invitation and reply should be written on small paper of the  best quality, and enclosed in envelopes to correspond.    Note paper of the most dainty and fastidious kind may be used by a  lady with propriety and elegance, but only when she is writing to her  friends and equals. Business letters or letters to her tradespeople  should be written on plain paper, and enclosed either in an adhesive  envelope, or sealed with red wax.    Never omit the address and date from any letter, whether of business  or friendship.    Letters in the first person addressed to strangers should begin with  \"Sir,\" or \"Madam,\" and end with \"I have the honour to be your very  obedient servant.\" Some object to this form of words from a mistaken  sense of pride; but it is merely a form, and, rightly apprehended,  evinces a \"proud humility,\" which implies more condescension than a  less formal phrase.    At the end of your letter, at some little distance below your  signature, and in the left corner of your paper, write the name of  the person to whom your letter is addressed; as \"Lady Dalhousie,\" or  \"Edward Munroe, Esquire.\"    It is more polite to write Esquire at full length than to curtail it  to Esq.    In writing to persons much your superior or inferior, use as few words  as possible. In the former case, to take up much of a great man's  time is to take a liberty; in the latter, to be diffuse is to be too  familiar. It is only in familiar correspondence that long letters are  permissible.    In writing to a tradesman, begin your letter by addressing him by  name, as--    \"Mr. Jones,--Sir.\"    A letter thus begun may, with propriety, be ended with--    \"Sir, yours truly.\"    Letters to persons whom you meet frequently in society, without having  arrived at intimacy, may commence with \"Dear Madam,\" and end with \"I  am, dear Madam, yours very truly.\"    Letters commencing \"My dear Madam,\" addressed to persons whom you  appreciate, and with whom you are on friendly terms, may end with \"I  am, my dear Madam, yours very faithfully,\" or \"yours very sincerely.\"    To be prompt in replying to a letter is to be polite.    Lady correspondents are too apt to over-emphasize in their  letter-writing, and in general evince a sad disregard of the laws  of punctuation. We would respectfully suggest that a comma is not  designed to answer every purpose, and that the underlining of every  second or third word adds nothing to the eloquence or clearness of  a letter, however certain it may be to provoke an unflattering smile  upon the lips of the reader.    All letters must be prepaid.           *       *       *       *       *    VI.--THE PROMENADE.      In England, a lady may accept the arm of a gentleman with whom she is  walking, even though he be only an acquaintance. This is not the case  either in America or on the Continent. There a lady can take the  arm of no gentleman who is not either her husband, lover, or near  relative.    If a lady has been making purchases during her walk, she may permit  the gentleman who accompanies her to carry any small, parcel that she  may have in her own hand; but she should not burthen him with more  than one under any circumstances whatever.    Two ladies may without any impropriety take each one arm of a single  cavalier; but one lady cannot, with either grace or the sanction of  custom take the arms of two gentlemen at the same time.    When a lady is walking with a gentleman in a park, or public garden,  or through the rooms of an exhibition, and becomes fatigued, it is  the gentleman's duty to find her a seat. If, however, as is very  frequently "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12428"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#3)"],[1,"press, there must be to the suffering, which has been occasioned, a  corresponding portion of immorality or guilt.    We are obliged then to view the counterpart of the evil in question, before  we can make a proper estimate of the nature of it. And, in examining this  part of it, we shall find that we have a no less frightful picture to  behold than in the former cases; or that, while the miseries endured by the  unfortunate Africans excite our pity on the one hand, the vices, which are  connected with them, provoke our indignation and abhorrence on the other.  The Slave-trade, in this point of view, must strike us as an immense mass  of evil on account of the criminality attached to it, as displayed in the  various branches of it, which have already been examined. For, to take the  counterpart of the evil in the first of these, can we say, that no moral  turpitude is to be placed to the account of those, who living on the  continent of Africa give birth to the enormities, which take place in  consequence of the prosecution of this trade? Is not that man made morally  worse, who is induced to become a tiger to his species, or who, instigated  by avarice, lies in wait in the thicket to get possession of his  fellow-man? Is no injustice manifest in the land, where the prince,  unfaithful to his duty, seizes his innocent subjects, and sells them for  slaves? Are no moral evils produced among those communities, which make war  upon other communities for the sake of plunder, and without any previous  provocation or offence? Does no crime attach to those, who accuse others  falsely, or who multiply and divide crimes for the sake of the profit of  the  punishment, and who for the same reason, continue the use of barbarous  and absurd ordeals as a test of innocence or guilt?    In the second of these branches the counterpart of the evil is to be seen  in the conduct of those, who purchase the miserable natives in their own  country, and convey them to distant lands. And here questions, similar to  the former, may be asked. Do they experience no corruption of their nature,  or become chargeable with no violation of right, who, when they go with  their ships to this continent, know the enormities which their visits there  will occasion, who buy their fellow-creature man, and this, knowing the way  in which he comes into their hands, and who chain, and imprison, and  scourge him? Do the moral feelings of those persons escape without injury,  whose hearts are hardened? And can the hearts of those be otherwise than  hardened, who are familiar with the tears and groans of innocent strangers  forcibly torn away from every thing that is dear to them in life, who are  accustomed to see them on board their vessels in a state of suffocation and  in the agonies of despair, and who are themselves in the habits of the  cruel use of arbitrary power?    The counterpart of the evil in its third branch is to be seen in the  conduct of those, who, when these miserable people have been landed,  purchase and carry them to their respective homes. And let us see whether a  mass of wickedness is not generated also in the present case. Can those  have nothing to answer for, who separate the faithful ties which nature and  religion have created? Can their feelings be otherwise than corrupted, who  consider their fellow-creatures as brutes, or treat those as cattle, who  may become the temples of the Holy Spirit, and in whom the Divinity  disdains not himself to dwell? Is there no injustice in forcing men to  labour without wages? Is there no breach of duty, when we are commanded to  clothe the naked, and feed the hungry, and visit the sick and in prison, in  exposing them to want, in torturing them by cruel punishment, and in  grinding them down, by hard labour, so as to shorten their days? Is there  no crime in adopting a system, which keeps down all the noble faculties of  their souls, and which positively debases and corrupts their nature? Is  there no crime in perpetuating these evils among their innocent offspring?  And finally, besides all these crimes, is there not naturally in the  familiar sight of the exercise, but more especially in the exercise itself,  of uncontrolled power, that which vitiates the internal man? In seeing  misery stalk daily over the land, do not all become insensibly hardened? By  giving birth to that misery themselves, do they not become abandoned? In  what state of society are the corrupt appetites so easily, so quickly, and  so frequently indulged, and where else, by means of frequent indulgence, do  these experience such a monstrous growth? Where else is the temper subject  to such frequent irritation, or passion to such little control? Yes--If the  unhappy slave is in an unfortunate situation, so is the tyrant who holds  him. Action and reaction are equal to each other, as well in the moral as  in the natural world. You cannot exercise an improper dominion over a  fellow-creature, but by a wise ordering of Providence you must necessarily  injure yourself.    Having now considered the nature of the evil of the Slave-trade in its  three separate departments of suffering, and in its corresponding  counterparts of guilt, I shall make a few observations on the extent of it.    On this subject it must strike us, that the misery and the crimes included  in the evil, as it has been found in Africa, were not like common maladies,  which make a short or periodical visit and then are gone, but that they  were continued daily. Nor were they like diseases, which from local causes  attack a village or a town, and by the skill of the physician, under the  blessing of Providence, are removed, but they affected a whole continent.  The trade with all its horrors began at the river Senegal, and continued,  winding with the coast, through its several geographical divisions to Cape  Negro; a distance of more than three thousand miles. In various lines or  paths formed at right angles from the shore, and passing into the heart of  the country, slaves were procured and brought down. The distance, which  many of them travelled, was immense. Those, who have been in Africa, have  assured us, that they came as far as from the sources of their largest  rivers, which we know to be many hundred miles in-land, and the natives  have told us, in their way of computation, that they came a journey of many  moons.    It must strike us again, that the misery and the crimes, included in the  evil, as it has been shown in the transportation, had no ordinary bounds.  They were not to be seen in the crossing of a river, but of an ocean. They  did not begin in the morning and end at night, but were continued for many  weeks, and sometimes by casualties for a quarter of the year. They were not  limited to the precincts of a solitary ship, but were spread among many  vessels; and these were so constantly passing, that the ocean itself never  ceased to be a witness of their existence.    And it must strike us finally, that the misery and crimes, included in the  evil as it has been found in foreign lands, were not confined within the  shores of a little island. Most of the islands of a continent, and many of  these of considerable population and extent, were filled with them. And the  continent itself, to which these geographically belong, was widely polluted  by their domain. Hence, if we were to take the vast extent of space  occupied by these crimes and sufferings from the heart of Africa to its  shores, and that which they filled on the continent of America and the  islands adjacent, and were to join the crimes and sufferings in one to  those in the other by the crimes and sufferings which took place in the  track of the vessels successively crossing the Atlantic, we should behold a  vast belt as it were of physical and moral evil, reaching through land and  ocean to the length of nearly half the circle of the globe.    The next view, which I shall take of this evil, will be as it relates to  the difficulty of subduing it.    This difficulty may be supposed to have been more than ordinarily great.  Many evils of a public nature, which existed in former times, were the  offspring of ignorance and superstition, and they were subdued of course by  the progress of light and knowledge. But the evil in question began in  avarice. It was nursed also by worldly interest. It did not therefore so  easily yield to the usual correctives of disorders in the world. We may  observe also, that the interest by which it was thus supported, was not  that of a few individuals, nor of one body, but of many bodies of men. It  was interwoven again into the system of the commerce and of the revenue of  nations. Hence the merchant--the planter--the mortgagee--the  manufacturer--the politician--the legislator--the cabinet-minister--lifted  up their voices against the annihilation of it. For these reasons the  Slave-trade may be considered, like the fabulous hydra, to have had a  hundred heads, every one of which it was necessary to cut off before it  could be subdued. And as none but Hercules was fitted to conquer the one,  so nothing less than extraordinary prudence, courage, labour, and patience,  could overcome the other. To protection in this manner by his hundred  interests it was owing, that the monster stalked in security for so long a  time. He stalked too in the open day, committing his mighty depredations.  And when good men, whose duty it was to mark him as the object of their  destruction, began to assail him, he did not fly, but gnashed his teeth at  them, growling savagely at the same time, and putting himself into a  posture of defiance.    We see then, in whatever light we consider the Slave-trade, whether we  examine into the nature of it, or whether we look into the extent of it, or  whether we estimate the difficulty of subduing it, we must conclude that no  evil more monstrous has ever existed upon earth. But if so, then we have  proved the truth of"]]]
