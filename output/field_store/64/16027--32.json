If such conduct is not severely  dealt with, no confidence can be placed in any man engaged in future  expeditions.    Monday, 21st November, Fanny Springs. Kekwick and I commenced chaining  the base-line from the top of Mount Charles, bearing 131 degrees.  Distance chained, four miles thirty chains. I ordered H. Strong to come  to me with two horses, which he did about 1.30 p.m.; we had finished the  line, and were waiting for him. I had seen some country that looked very  much like springs, to the north-east, a mile or so from the line; went to  examine it, and found some splendid springs--one in particular is a very  large fountain, about twenty yards in diameter, quite circular and  apparently very deep, from which there is running a large stream of water  of the very finest description; it is one of the largest reservoirs I  have yet seen, three times the size of the one at the Hamilton Springs,  with abundance of water for any amount of cattle; the water is running a  mile below it.    Tuesday, 22nd November, Fanny Springs. Engaged chaining the base-line to  north-west. Saw some more springs a mile or two to the east; too tired to  examine them to-day. It is dreadfully hot. Returned to the camp at  sundown.    Wednesday, 23rd November, Fanny Springs. Finished the remaining part of  base-line. The line is ten miles and forty chains long, crossing the top  of Mount Charles.    Thursday, 24th November, Fanny Springs. Fixing the angles of runs. Found  another batch of springs close to north-west boundary of large run,  covering four or five acres of ground, with an immense quantity of reeds;  they are not so active as the others. The ground round about is very  soft, and the water is most excellent. After fixing the north-east  corner, I proceeded to examine the country beyond the boundaries of the  runs in search of springs. Having gone several miles north, I saw the  appearance of a lagoon north-east, for which I started, but on my arrival  found no springs round it. Still continued on the same course for a  considerable distance further to a high sand hill, from which we could  see the Neale winding through a broad valley. One part of the creek being  much greener than the other, I went to examine it, and found the green  appearance to be caused by fresh gum-trees, young saplings, rushes, and  other fresh-water plants and bushes. The creek spreads over the plain in  numerous channels, four miles wide, but the main channel has only  gum-trees, with a chain of water holes, some salt, some brackish. By  scratching on the bank where the rushes were growing we got some  beautiful water in the gravel, a few inches below the surface. There was  plenty of feed, and the wild currant, or rather grape, grew in great  abundance, and was very superior to any I had tasted before. There were  two kinds; one grew upon a dark-green bush, and had a tart and saltish  taste, the other grew upon a bush of a much lighter colour, the fruit  round and plump and much superior to the former; in taste it very much  resembled some species of dark grape, only a little more acid. From this  I went in a north-east direction to a mound I had seen on my former  journey, and found it to be hot springs with a large stream of warm water  flowing from them nearly as large as the Emerald Springs, and, as it  seemed to me, warmer. It was a very hot day, and I had been riding fast.  It was as much as I could bear to keep my hand in the spring for a few  minutes, six inches below the surface. I put in a staff about four feet  long, but could find no bottom--nothing but very soft mud; the staff came  up quite hot. It is a very remarkable hill. From the west side it would  be taken for a very high sand hill with scrub growing on it--in fact it  is so. The springs are not seen until the top is reached. From them all  the east side is covered with green reeds to the base of the hill. The  hot springs are near the top, and cold ones on one side to the south;  some at the bottom and some half-way up. There is a large lagoon to the  east, which I will examine when I move the party up to this, for I have  no time to-day. Returned towards the camp and fixed the north-west corner  of the second run; I am obliged to drive pickets into the ground to show  them. I would have built cones of stones, but could get none large enough  to do it with. Arrived at the camp very late; fourteen hours on  horseback.    Friday, 25th November, Fanny Springs. Started shortly after sunrise to  mark the other two corners of the two runs. On approaching the south-west  angle of the second run (Parry Spring run), I discovered three other  springs close to the boundary of the first run. Two of them are outside,  and one inside, or rather on the boundary. The latter is a large spring,  having seven streams of water coming from it, one large, the others  smaller. The other two have abundance of water, covered with reeds.  Proceeded and marked the other corners, but, having no stones, was  obliged to put down pickets. Returned to camp, keeping outside the south  boundary in search of springs, but found none. Crossed over table land,  salt bush and grass, with stones on the surface. Arrived at the camp a  little before sundown.    Saturday, 26th November, Fanny Springs. Started for Parry Springs. In the  evening commenced putting up a cone of stones on the northernmost hill.  The day was excessively hot. One great thing here is that the nights are  very cool, so that we are obliged to have a good fire on all night. We  have had one or two warm nights since I have been out this time. I  suppose the reason must be that a large body of water exists in the lake  not far distant from us, the wind coming from north-east. From north-west  to south-south-east the winds are generally cool. It is so cold in the  morning that the men are wearing their top-coats; the day does not get  hot until the sun is a considerable height.    Sunday, 27th November, Parry Springs. Cold wind this morning from the  east. In the afternoon the sky became overcast, the clouds coming from  the south-east.    Monday, 28th November, Parry Springs. Building a cone of stones on the  northernmost of the hills, fixing the south-east corner of run Number 2,  and moving to the hot springs. Arrived at sundown. Saw a number of holes  where the natives had been digging for water. Cleaned out one, and found  water at two feet from the surface, above the water in the creek. It is  very good. On examining this spring, I find there is a great deal more  water coming from it than from the Emerald Springs. The hot springs are  on the top of the sand hill, and the cold ones at the foot. There are  large quantities of the wild grape growing here, both red and white. They  are very good indeed, and, if cultivated, would, I think, become a very  nice fruit.    Tuesday, 29th November, Primrose springs. Surveying run. Sent Muller to  the north to a distant range, and Strong to the north-east to look for  springs. Towards evening both returned without being successful. They  passed over plenty of good feeding country, but the range is high and  stony, with very little grass, only salt bush. It is a continuation of  Hanson range, all table land.    Wednesday, 30th November, Primrose springs. Surveying, etc. North-east  corner of run Number 2 is about two miles west of the Neale. I scratched  a few inches deep from the surface in the gravel, and found very good  water. The wild grape is in abundance here, and grows as large as the  cultivated one. I have obtained some choice seeds.    Thursday, 1st December, Primrose springs. At daybreak started with  Kekwick to find the lake on an easterly course, keeping to south of east,  to avoid a soft lagoon. Travelled over a fair salt-bush and grass  country, with stones on the surface. In places the grass is abundant,  though dry. At seven miles the sand hills commenced; they are low, with  broad valleys between, covered with stone. On the sand hills there was  plenty of grass, and numerous native and emu tracks going towards the  Neale, which is to the south of us. At fourteen miles struck a gum creek  with salt water. Searched for springs, but could find none with  fresh-water. Continued on a course east over sand hills and stony plain,  and at twenty miles crossed the Neale. It is very broad, with numerous  channels. In the main one there was plenty of water, but it was very  brackish. We scratched a hole on the bank about two feet from the salt  water, and found plenty of good water at six inches from the surface, of  which our horses drank very readily. This seems to be the mode in which  the natives obtain good water in a dry season like this. The emus and  other birds also adopt the same plan. An immense quantity of water must  come down this creek at times. The drift stuff was upwards of thirteen  feet high in the gum-trees. A number of native tracks all about the  creek, quite fresh, but we could not see any one. After giving our horses  as much water as they would drink, we crossed the creek, which now runs  north, and proceeded, still on our easterly course, over stony plains for  four miles, then over sand hills, which continued to the lake, which we  struck at thirty-five miles. The atmosphere is so thick, it is impossible  to say what it is like to-night. Camped without water under a high sand  hill, so that I may have a good view of the lake in the morning. I like  not the appearance of it to-night; I am afraid we are going to lose it.    Friday, 2nd December, Lake Torrens. Got up at the first peep of day and  ascended the sand hill. I fear my conjecture of last night is too true. I  can see a small dark line of low land all round the horizon. The line of  blue water is very small. So ends Lake Torrens! Started on a course of 30  degrees west of north to where the Neale"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8914"],[0,"England, My England (#20)"],[1,"looking, broad at the loins.    'I's come back then,' said the father to the son; 'leastwise, he's bin  browt back, flyed ower the Griff Low.'    The son looked at me. He had a devil-may-care bearing, his cap on one  side, his hands stuck in the front pockets of his breeches. But he said  nothing.    'Shall you come in a minute, Master,' said the elderly woman, to me.    'Ay, come in an' ha'e a cup o' tea or summat. You'll do wi' summat,  carrin' that bod. Come on, Maggie wench, let's go in.'    So we went indoors, into the rather stuffy, overcrowded living-room, that  was too cosy, and too warm. The son followed last, standing in the  doorway. The father talked to me.    Maggie put out the tea-cups. The mother went into the dairy again.    'Tha'lt rouse thysen up a bit again, now, Maggie,' the father-in-law  said--and then to me: ''ers not bin very bright sin' Alfred came whoam,  an' the bod flyed awee. 'E come whoam a Wednesday night, Alfred did. But  ay, you knowed, didna yer. Ay, 'e comed 'a Wednesday--an' I reckon there  wor a bit of a to-do between 'em, worn't there, Maggie?'    He twinkled maliciously to his daughter-in-law, who was flushed,  brilliant and handsome.    'Oh, be quiet, father. You're wound up, by the sound of you,' she said to  him, as if crossly. But she could never be cross with him.    ''Ers got 'er colour back this mornin',' continued the father-in-law  slowly. 'It's bin heavy weather wi' 'er this last two days. Ay--'er's bin  northeast sin 'er seed you a Wednesday.'    'Father, do stop talking. You'd wear the leg off an iron pot. I can't  think where you've found your tongue, all of a sudden,' said Maggie, with  caressive sharpness.    'Ah've found it wheer I lost it. Aren't goin' ter come in an' sit thee  down, Alfred?'    But Alfred turned and disappeared.    ''E's got th' monkey on 'is back ower this letter job,' said the father  secretly to me. 'Mother, 'er knows nowt about it. Lot o' tom-foolery,  isn't it? Ay! What's good o' makkin' a peck o' trouble over what's far  enough off, an' ned niver come no nigher. No--not a smite o' use. That's  what I tell 'er. 'Er should ta'e no notice on't. Ty, what can y' expect.'    The mother came in again, and the talk became general. Maggie flashed her  eyes at me from time to time, complacent and satisfied, moving among the  men. I paid her little compliments, which she did not seem to hear. She  attended to me with a kind of sinister, witch-like graciousness, her dark  head ducked between her shoulders, at once humble and powerful. She was  happy as a child attending to her father-in-law and to me. But there was  something ominous between her eyebrows, as if a dark moth were settled  there--and something ominous in her bent, hulking bearing.    She sat on a low stool by the fire, near her father-in-law. Her head was  dropped, she seemed in a state of abstraction. From time to time she  would suddenly recover, and look up at us, laughing and chatting. Then  she would forget again. Yet in her hulked black forgetting she seemed  very near to us.    The door having been opened, the peacock came slowly in, prancing calmly.  He went near to her and crouched down, coiling his blue neck. She glanced  at him, but almost as if she did not observe him. The bird sat silent,  seeming to sleep, and the woman also sat hulked and silent, seemingly  oblivious. Then once more there was a heavy step, and Alfred entered. He  looked at his wife, and he looked at the peacock crouching by her. He  stood large in the doorway, his hands stuck in front of him, in his  breeches pockets. Nobody spoke. He turned on his heel and went out again.    I rose also to go. Maggie started as if coming to herself.    'Must you go?' she asked, rising and coming near to me, standing in front  of me, twisting her head sideways and looking up at me. 'Can't you stop a  bit longer? We can all be cosy today, there's nothing to do outdoors.'  And she laughed, showing her teeth oddly. She had a long chin.    I said I must go. The peacock uncoiled and coiled again his long blue  neck, as he lay on the hearth. Maggie still stood close in front of me,  so that I was acutely aware of my waistcoat buttons.    'Oh, well,' she said, 'you'll come again, won't you? Do come again.'    I promised.    'Come to tea one day--yes, do!'    I promised--one day.    The moment I went out of her presence I ceased utterly to exist for  her--as utterly as I ceased to exist for Joey. With her curious  abstractedness she forgot me again immediately. I knew it as I left her.  Yet she seemed almost in physical contact with me while I was with her.    The sky was all pallid again, yellowish. When I went out there was no  sun; the snow was blue and cold. I hurried away down the hill, musing on  Maggie. The road made a loop down the sharp face of the slope. As I went  crunching over the laborious snow I became aware of a figure striding  down the steep scarp to intercept me. It was a man with his hands in  front of him, half stuck in his breeches pockets, and his shoulders  square--a real farmer of the hills; Alfred, of course. He waited for me  by the stone fence.    'Excuse me,' he said as I came up.    I came to a halt in front of him and looked into his sullen blue eyes. He  had a certain odd haughtiness on his brows. But his blue eyes stared  insolently at me.    'Do you know anything about a letter--in French--that my wife opened--a  letter of mine--?'    'Yes,' said I. 'She asked me to read it to her.'    He looked square at me. He did not know exactly how to feel.    'What was there in it?' he asked.    'Why?' I said. 'Don't you know?'    'She makes out she's burnt it,' he said.    'Without showing it you?' I asked.    He nodded slightly. He seemed to be meditating as to what line of action  he should take. He wanted to know the contents of the letter: he must  know: and therefore he must ask me, for evidently his wife had taunted  him. At the same time, no doubt, he would like to wreak untold vengeance  on my unfortunate person. So he eyed me, and I eyed him, and neither of  us spoke. He did not want to repeat his request to me. And yet I only  looked at him, and considered.    Suddenly he threw back his head and glanced down the valley. Then he  changed his position--he was a horse-soldier. Then he looked at me  confidentially.    'She burnt the blasted thing before I saw it,' he said.    'Well,' I answered slowly, 'she doesn't know herself what was in it.'    He continued to watch me narrowly. I grinned to myself.    'I didn't like to read her out what there was in it,' I continued.    He suddenly flushed so that the veins in his neck stood out, and he  stirred again uncomfortably.    'The Belgian girl said her baby had been born a week ago, and that they  were going to call it Alfred,' I told him.    He met my eyes. I was grinning. He began to grin, too.    'Good luck to her,' he said.    'Best of luck,' said I.    'And what did you tell _her_?' he asked.    'That the baby belonged to the old mother--that it was brother to your  girl, who was writing to you as a friend of the family.'    He stood smiling, with the long, subtle malice of a farmer.    'And did she take it in?' he asked.    'As much as she took anything else.'    He stood grinning fixedly. Then he broke into a short laugh.    'Good for _her_' he exclaimed cryptically.    And then he laughed aloud once more, evidently feeling he had won a big  move in his contest with his wife.    'What about the other woman?' I asked.    'Who?'    'Elise.'    'Oh'--he shifted uneasily--'she was all right--'    'You'll be getting back to her,' I said.    He looked at me. Then he made a grimace with his mouth.    'Not me,' he said. 'Back your life it's a plant.'    'You don't think the _cher petit bebe_ is a little Alfred?'    'It might be,' he said.    'Only might?'    'Yes--an' there's lots of mites in a pound of cheese.' He laughed  boisterously but uneasily.    'What did she say, exactly?' he asked.    I began to repeat, as well as I could, the phrases of the letter:    '_Mon cher Alfred--Figure-toi comme je suis desolee_--'    He listened with some confusion. When I had finished all I could  remember, he said:    'They know how to pitch you out a letter, those Belgian lasses.'    'Practice,' said I.    'They get plenty,' he said.    There was a pause.    'Oh, well,' he said. 'I've never got that letter, anyhow.'    The wind blew fine and keen, in the sunshine, across the snow. I blew my  nose and prepared to depart.    'And _she_ doesn't know anything?' he continued, jerking his head up the  hill in the direction of Tible.    'She knows nothing but what I've said--that is, if she really burnt the  letter.'    'I believe she burnt it,' he said, 'for spite. She's a little devil, she  is. But I shall have it out with her.' His jaw was stubborn and sullen.  Then suddenly he turned to me with a new note.    'Why?' he said. 'Why didn't you wring that b---- peacock's neck-that  b---- Joey?'    'Why?' I said. 'What for?'    'I hate the brute,' he said. 'I had a shot at him--'    I laughed. He stood and mused.    'Poor little Elise,' he murmured.    'Was she small--_petite_?' I asked. He jerked up his head.    'No,' he said. 'Rather tall.'    'Taller than your wife, I suppose.'    Again he looked into my eyes. And then once more he went into a loud  burst of laughter that made the still, snow-deserted valley clap again.    'God, it's a knockout!' he said, thoroughly amused. Then he stood at  ease, one foot out, his hands in his breeches pockets, in front of him,  his head thrown back, a handsome figure of a man.    'But I'll do that blasted Joey in--' he mused.    I ran down the hill, shouting with laughter.          _You Touched Me_      The Pottery House was a square, ugly, brick house girt in by the wall  that enclosed the whole grounds of the pottery itself. To be sure, a  privet hedge partly masked the house and its ground from the pottery-yard"]]]
