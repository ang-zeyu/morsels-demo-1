VAL'S AWAKENING    Val stood just inside the door of the hotel parlor and glanced swiftly  around at the place of unpleasant memory.    \"No, I must see Manley before I can tell you whether we shall want to stay  or not,\" she replied to Arline's insistence that she \"go right up to a  room\" and lie down. \"I feel quite well, and you must not bother about me at  all. If Mr. Burnett will be good enough to send Manley to me--I must see  him first of all.\" It was Val in her most unapproachable mood, and Arline  subsided before it.    \"Well, then, I'll go and send word to Man, and see about some supper for  us. I feel as if _I_ could eat ten-penny nails!\" She went out into the  hall, hesitated a moment, and then boldly invaded the \"office.\"    \"Say! have you got Man rounded up yit?\" she demanded of her husband. \"And  how is he, anyhow? That girl ain't got the first idea of what ails him--how  anybody with the brains and education she's got can be so thick-headed gits  me. Jim told me Man's been packing a bottle or two home with him every trip  he's made for the last month--and she don't know a thing about it. I'd like  to know what 'n time they learn folks back East, anyhow; to put their eyes  and their sense in their pockets, I guess, and go along blind as bats.  Where's Kent at? Did he go after him? She won't do nothing till she sees  Man--\"    At that moment Kent came in, and his disgust needed no words. He answered  Mrs. Hawley's inquiring look with a shake of the head.    \"I can't do anything with him,\" he said morosely. \"He's so full he don't  know he's got a wife, hardly. You better go and tell her, Mrs. Hawley.  Somebody's got to.\"    \"Oh, my heavens!\" Arline clutched at the doorknob for moral support. \"I  could no more face them yellow eyes of hern when they blaze up--you go tell  her yourself, if you want her told. I've got to see about some supper for  us. I ain't had a bite since dinner, and Min's off gadding somewheres--\"  She hurried away, mentally washing her hands of the affair. \"Women's got to  learn some time what men is,\" she soliloquized, \"and I guess she ain't  no better than any of the rest of us, that she can't learn to take her  medicine--but _I_ ain't goin' to be the one to tell her what kinda fellow  she's tied to. My stunt'll be helpin' her pick up the pieces and make the  best of it after she's told.\"    She stopped, just inside the dining room, and listened until she heard Kent  cross the hall from the office and open the parlor door. \"Gee! It's like a  hangin',\" she sighed. \"If she wasn't so plumb innocent--\" She started  for the door which opened into the parlor from the dining room, strongly  tempted to eavesdrop. She did yield so far as to put her ear to the  keyhole, but the silence within impressed her strangely, and she retreated  to the kitchen and closed the door tightly behind her as the most practical  method of bidding Satan begone.    The silence in the parlor lasted while Kent, standing with his back against  the door, faced Val and meditated swiftly upon the manner of his telling.    \"Well?\" she demanded at last. \"I am still waiting to see Manley. I am not  quite a child, Mr. Burnett. I know something is the matter, and you--if you  have any pity, or any feeling of friendship, you will tell me the truth.  Don't you suppose I know that Arline was--_lying_ to me all the time about  Manley? You helped her to lie. So did that other man. I waited until I  reached town, where I could do something, and now you must tell me the  truth. Manley is badly hurt, or he is dead. Tell me which it is, and take  me to him.\" She spoke fast, as if she was afraid she might not be able to  finish, though her voice was even and low, it was also flat and toneless  with her effort to seem perfectly calm and self-controlled.    Kent looked at her, forgot all about leading up to the truth by easy  stages, as he had intended to do, and gave it to her straight. \"He ain't  either one,\" he said. \"He's drunk!\"    Val stared at him. \"Drunk!\" He could see how even her lips shrank from the  word. She threw up her head. \"That,\" she declared icily, \"I know to be  impossible!\"    \"Oh, do you? Let me tell you that's _never_ impossible with a man, not when  there's whisky handy.\"    \"Manley is not that sort of a man. When he left me, three years ago, he  promised me never to frequent places where liquor is sold. He never had  touched liquor; he never was tempted to touch it. But, just to be doubly  sure, he promised me, on his honor. He has never broken that promise; I  know, because he told me so.\" She made the explanation scornfully, as  if her pride and her belief in Manley almost forbade the indignity of  explaining. \"I don't know why you should come here and insult me,\" she  added, with a lofty charity for his sin.    \"I don't see how it can insult you,\" he contended. \"You're got a different  way of looking at things, but that won't help you to dodge facts. Man's  drunk. I said it, and I mean it. It ain't the first time, nor the second.  He was drunk the day you came, and couldn't meet the train. That's why I  met you. I ought to've told you, I guess, but I hated to make you feel bad.  So I went to work and sobered him up, and sent him over to get married.  I've always been kinda sorry for that. It was a low-down trick to play on  you, and that's a fact. You ought to've had a chance to draw outa the game,  but I didn't think about it at the time. Man and I have always been pretty  good friends, and I was thinking of _his_ side of the case. I thought he'd  straighten up after he got married; he wasn't such a hard drinker--only  he'd go on a toot when he got into town, like lots of men. I didn't think  it had such a strong hold on him. And I knew he thought a lot of you, and  if you went back on him it'd hit him pretty hard. Man ain't a bad fellow,  only for that. And he's liable to do better when he finds out you know  about it. A man will do 'most anything for a woman he thinks a lot of.\"    \"Indeed!\" Val was sitting now upon the red plush chair. Her face was  perfectly colorless, her manner frozen. The word seemed to speak itself,  without having any relation whatever to her thoughts and her emotions.    Kent waited. It seemed to him that she took it harder than she would have  taken the news that Manley was dead. He had no means of gauging the horror  of a young woman who has all her life been familiar with such terms as \"the  demon rum,\" and who has been taught that \"intemperance is the doorway to  perdition\"; a young woman whose life has been sheltered jealously from all  contact with the ugly things of the world, and who believes that she might  better die than marry a drunkard. He watched her unobtrusively.    \"Anyway, it was worrying over you that made him get off wrong to-day,\" he  ventured at last, as a sort of palliative. \"They say he was going to start  home right in the face of the fire, and when they wouldn't let him, he  headed straight for a saloon and commenced to pour whisky down him. He  thought sure you--he thought the fire would--\"    \"I see,\" Val interrupted stonily. \"For the very doubtful honor of shaking  the hand of a politician, he left me alone to face as best I might  the possibility of burning alive; and when it seemed likely that the  possibility had become a certainty, he must celebrate his bereavement by  becoming a beast. Is that what you would have me believe of my husband?\"    \"That's about the size of it,\" Kent admitted reluctantly. \"Only I wouldn't  have put it just that way, maybe.\"    \"Indeed! And how would you pit it, then?\"    Kent leaned harder against the door, and looked at her curiously. Women, it  seemed to him, were always going to extremes; they were either too soft and  meek, or else they were too hard and unmerciful.    \"How would you put it? I am rather curious to know your point of view.\"    \"Well, I know men better than you do, Mrs. Fleetwood. I know they can do  some things that look pretty rotten on the surface, and yet be fairly  decent underneath. You don't know how a habit like that gets a fellow just  where he's weakest. Man ain't a beast. He's selfish and careless, and he  gives way too easy, but he thinks the world of you. Jim says he cried like  a baby when he came into the saloon, and acted like a crazy man. You don't  want to be too hard on him. I've an idea this will learn him a lesson. If  you take him the right way, Mrs. Fleetwood, the chances are he'll quit  drinking.\"    Val smiled. Kent thought he had never before seen a smile like that, and  hoped he never would see another. There was in it neither mercy nor mirth,  but only the hard judgment of a woman who does not understand.    \"Will you bring him to me here, Mr. Burnett? I do not feel quite equal  to invading a saloon and begging him, on my knees, to come--after the  conventional manner of drunkards' wives. But I should like to see him.\"    Kent stared. \"He ain't in any shape to argue with,\" he remonstrated. \"You  better wait a while.\"    She rested her chin upon her hands, folded upon the high chair back, and  gazed at him with her tawny eyes, that somehow reminded Kent of a lioness  in a cage. He thought swiftly that a lioness would have as much mercy as  she had in that mood.    \"Mr. Burnett,\" she began quietly, when Kent's nerves were beginning to feel  the strain of her silent stare, \"I want to see Manley _as he is now_. I  will tell you why. You aren't a woman, and you never will understand, but I  shall tell you; I want to tell _somebody_.    \"I was raised well--that sounds queer, but modesty forbids more. At any  rate, my mother was very careful about me. She believed in a girl marrying  and becoming a good wife to a good man, and to that end she taught me and  trained me. A woman must give her all--her life, her past, present, and  future--to the man she marries. For three years I thought how unworthy I  was to be Manley's wife."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8556"],[0,"The History of England from the Norman Conquest to the Death of John (1066-1216) (#20)"],[1,"fact. To notice here but one inference  from it, it means that no one questioned the title of William Rufus to  the throne while he was in possession. Though he might be a younger son,  not elected, but appointed by his father, and put into the kingship by  the act of the primate alone, he was, to the rebellious barons as to his  own supporters, the rightful king of England till he could be overthrown.    The insurrection being put down, a general amnesty seems to have been  extended to the rebels. The Bishop of Bayeux was exiled from England;  some confiscations were made, and some rewards distributed; but almost  without exception the leaders escaped punishment. The most notable  exception, besides Odo, was William of St. Calais, the Bishop of Durham.  For some reason, which does not clearly appear, the king found it  difficult to pardon him. He was summoned before the king's court to  answer for his conduct, and the account of the trial which followed in  November of this year, preserved to us by a writer friendly to the bishop  and present at the proceedings, is one of the most interesting and  instructive documents which we have from this time. William of St.  Calais, as the king's vassal for the temporalities of his bishopric, was  summoned before the king's feudal court to answer for breach of his  feudal obligations. William had shown, in one of the letters which he had  sent to the king shortly before the trial, that he was fully aware of  these obligations; and the impossibility of meeting the accusation was  perfectly clear to his mind. With the greatest subtlety and skill, he  sought to take advantage of his double position, as vassal and as bishop,  and to transfer the whole process to different ground. With equal skill,  and with an equally clear understanding of the principles involved,  Lanfranc met every move which he made.[14]    From the beginning the accused insisted upon the privileges of his order.  He would submit to a canonical trial only. He asked that the bishops  should appear in their pontificals, which was a request that they judge  him as bishops, and not as barons. Lanfranc answered him that they could  judge him well enough clad as they were. William demanded that his  bishopric should be restored to him before he was compelled to answer,  referring to the seizing of his temporalities by the king. Lanfranc  replied that he had not been deprived of his bishopric. He refused to  plead, however, until the point had been formally decided, and on the  decision of the court against him, he demanded the canonical grounds on  which they had acted. Lanfranc replied that the decision was just, and  that he ought to know that it was. He requested to be allowed to take  counsel with the other bishops on his answer, and Lanfranc explained that  the bishops were his judges and could not be his counsel, his answer  resting on a principle of the law necessary in the courts of public  assembly, one which gave rise to elaborate regulations in some feudal  countries. Bishop William finally refused to accept the judgment of the  court on several grounds, but especially because it was against the  canons; and Lanfranc explained at greater length than before, that he had  not been put on trial concerning his bishopric, but concerning his fief,  as the Bishop of Bayeux had been tried under William I. But all argument  was in vain. The bishop could not safely yield, and he insisted on his  appeal to Rome. On his side the king insisted on the surrender of the  bishop's castle, the last part of his fief which he still held, and was  sustained by the court in this demand. The bishop demurred, but at last  yielded the point to avoid arrest, and after considerable delay, he was  allowed to cross over to the continent. There he was welcomed by Robert  and employed in Normandy, but he never went any farther nor pushed his  appeal to Rome, which in all probability he had never seriously intended,  though there is evidence that the pope was disposed to take up his cause.  Throughout the case the king was acting wholly within his right,  regarding the bishop as his vassal; and Lanfranc's position in the trial  was in strict accordance with the feudal law.    This was the end of serious rebellion against King William Rufus. Seven  years later, in 1095, a conspiracy was formed by some of the barons who  had been pardoned for their earlier rebellion, which might have resulted  in a widespread insurrection but for the prompt action of William. Robert  of Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, who had inherited the 280 manors of  his uncle, the Bishop of Coutances, and was now one of the most powerful  barons of the kingdom, had been summoned to the king's court, probably  because the conspiracy was suspected, since it was for a fault which  would ordinarily have been passed over without remark, and he refused to  appear. The king's hands were for the moment free, and he marched at once  against the earl. By degrees the details of the conspiracy came out. From  Nottingham, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was accompanying the march,  was sent back to Kent to hold himself in readiness at a moment's notice  to defend that part of England against an expected landing from Normandy.  This time it had been planned to make Stephen of Aumale, a nephew of the  Conqueror, king in William's place; but no Norman invasion occurred. The  war was begun and ended by the siege and surrender of Mowbray's two  castles of Tynemouth and Bamborough. In the siege of the latter, Mowbray  himself was captured by a trick, and his newly married wife was forced to  surrender the castle by the threat of putting out his eyes. The earl was  thrown into prison, where, according to one account, he was held for  thirty years. Treachery among the traitors revealed the names of the  leaders of the plot, and punishments were inflicted more generally than  in 1088, but with no pretence of impartiality. A man of so high rank and  birth as William of Eu was barbarously mutilated; one man of minor rank  was hanged; banishment and fines were the penalties in other cases.  William of St. Calais, who had been restored to his see, fell again under  the suspicion of the king, and was summoned to stand another trial, but  he was already ill when he went up to the court, and died before he could  answer the charges against him. There were reasons enough in the heavy  oppressions of the reign why men should wish to rebel against William,  but he was so fixed in power, so resolute in action, and so pitiless  towards the victims of his policy, that the forming of a dangerous  combination against him was practically impossible.    The contemporary historians of his reign tell us much of William's  personality, both in set descriptions and in occasional reference and  anecdote. It is evident that he impressed in an unusual degree the men of  his own time, but it is evident also that this impression was not so much  made by his genius as a ruler or a soldier, by the possession of the  gifts which a great king would desire, as by something in his spirit and  attitude towards life which was new and strange, something out of the  common in words and action, which startled or shocked men of the common  level and seemed at times to verge upon the awful. In body he was shorter  than his father, thick-set and heavy, and his red face gave him the name  Rufus by which he was then and still is commonly known. Much of his  father's political and military ability and strength of will had  descended to him, but not his father's character and high purpose. Every  king of those times thought chiefly of himself, and looked upon the state  as his private property; but the second William more than most. The money  which he wrung from churchman and layman he used in attempts to carry out  his personal ambitions in Normandy, or scattered with a free hand among  his favourites, particularly among the mercenary soldiers from the  continent, with whom he especially loved to surround himself, and whose  licensed plunderings added greatly to the burden and tyranny of his  reign. But the ordinary doings of a tyrant were not the worst things  about William Rufus. Effeminate fashions, vices horrible and unheard-of  in England, flourished at his court and threatened to corrupt the nation.  The fearful profanity of the king, his open and blasphemous defiance of  God, made men tremble, and those who were nearest to him testified \"that  he every morning got up a worse man than he lay down, and every evening  lay down a worse man than he got up.\"    In the year after the suppression of the first attempt of the barons  against the king, but before other events of political importance had  occurred, on May 28, 1089, died Lanfranc, the great Archbishop of  Canterbury, after nearly nineteen years of service in that office. Best  of all the advisers of the first William, he was equally with him  conqueror of England, in that conquest of laws and civilization which  followed the mere conquest of arms. Not great, though famous as a  theologian and writer, his powers were rather of a practical nature. He  was skilful in the management of men; he had a keen appreciation of legal  distinctions, and that comprehensive sight at the same time of ends and  means which we call the organizing power. He was devoted to that great  reformation in the religious and ecclesiastical world which occurred  during his long life, but he was devoted to it in his own way, as his  nature directed. He saw clearly, for one thing, that the success of that  reformation in England depended on the maintenance of the strong  government of the Norman kings; and from his loyalty to them he never  swerved, serving them with wise counsel and with all the resources at his  command. Less of a theologian and idealist than his successor Anselm,  more of a lawyer and statesman, he could never have found himself, for  another thing, in"]]]
