THE  TRAVELS  OF  RICHARD LANDER,  INTO  THE INTERIOR OF AFRICA.        CHAPTER I.    Previously to entering upon the immediate subject of the origin and  progress of the different voyages, which have been undertaken for  exploring the interior of Africa, it may be not only interesting, but  highly instructive, to take a rapid survey of the great Peninsula, as  it appeared to the earlier travellers, and as it was found by the  last of them, amongst whom may be included the individual, whose  adventures in the present work, claim our chief attention. It is on  record, that the coasts of Africa have been navigated from as early a  period, as six hundred years before Christ, and, according to the  earliest records of history, the circumnavigation of Africa was  accomplished by the Phoenicians, in the service of Pharaoh Necho. On  referring to Herodotus, the earliest and most interesting of Greek  historians, and to whom we are indebted for the knowledge of many  important facts relative to Africa, in the earliest periods of its  history, we find, in corroboration of the circumnavigation of Africa  by the Phoenicians, \"that taking their course from the Red Sea they  entered into the Southern Ocean; on  the approach of autumn, they  landed in Lybia, and planted some corn in the place, where they  happened to find themselves; when this was ripe, and they had cut it  down, they again departed. Having thus consumed two years, they in  the third passed the columns of Hercules, and returned to Egypt.  Their relation may obtain attention from others, but to me it seems  incredible, for they affirmed that having sailed round Africa, _they  had the sun on their right hand._\"    It is worthy of remark, that the very circumstance, which led  Herodotus to attach discredit to the circumnavigation of Africa by  the Phoenicians, on account of their having the sun to the right, is  the very strongest presumption in favour of its truth. Some  historians have indeed endeavoured to prove, that the voyage was  altogether beyond any means, which navigation at that early era could  command; but in the learned exposition of Rennell, a strong degree of  probability is thrown upon the early tradition. At all events it may  be considered, that the obscure knowledge, which we possessed of the  peninsular figure of Africa, appears to have been derived from the  Phoenicians. Herodotus, however, was himself a traveller, in those  early times, of no mean celebrity. Despairing of obtaining accurate  information of the then known part of the habitable world, he  determined to have recourse to travelling, for the purpose of  completing those surveys, which had been undertaken by his  predecessors, and which had been left in a dubious and indefinite  state. He resided for a considerable period in Egypt, during which,  he entered into a friendly communion with the native priests, from  whom he obtained much accurate information, as well as a great deal  that was false and exaggerated relative to the extensive region,  which extends from the Nile to the Atlantic. According to his  description it is much inferior in fertility to the cultivated parts  of Europe and Asia, and suffering extremely from severe drought; yet  he makes mention of a few spots, such as Cinyps, and the high tract  Cyrene, which, undergoing the process of irrigation, may stand  comparison with the richest portions of the globe. Generally,  however, in quitting the northern coast, which he terms significantly  the forehead of Africa, the country became more and more arid. Hills  of salt arose, out of which the natives constructed their houses,  without any fear of their melting beneath a shower in a region where  rain was unknown. The land became almost a desert, and was filled  with such multitudes of wild beasts, as to be considered their proper  inheritance, and scarcely disputed with them by the human race.  Farther to the south, the soil no longer afforded food even to these  wild tenants; there was not a trunk of a tree, nor a drop of  water--total silence and desolation reigned.    This may be considered as the first picture on record of the northern  part of Africa; a country, which, even after the lapse of two  thousand years, presents to the eye of science, as regards its  interior recesses, a blank in geography, a physical and not less a  moral problem; a dark and bewildering mystery. The spirit of  enterprise has carried our mariners to the arctic seas, braving the  most appalling dangers in the solution of a great geographical  problem; by the same power, civilization has been carried into the  primeval forests of the American continent, and cities have arisen in  the very heart of the Andes. The interior of Africa, however,  notwithstanding its navigable rivers, has been hitherto almost a  sealed chapter in the history of the globe. The deserts, which extend  from Egypt to the Atlantic, and which cover a great surface of the  interior, have proved a barrier to the march of conquest, or  civilization; and whatever science has gained, has been wrested by  the utmost efforts of human perseverance and the continual sacrifice  of human life.    It must, however, be allowed that there are obstacles existing to the  knowledge and the civilization of central Africa, which cannot be  overcome by the confederated power of human genius. Extending 5000  miles in length, and nearly the same extent in breadth, it presents  an area, according to Malte Brun, of 13,430,000 square miles,  unbroken by any estuary, or inland sea, and intersected by a few long  or easily navigable rivers; all its known chains of mountains are of  moderate height, rising in terraces, down which the waters find their  way in cataracts, not through deep ravines and fertile valleys. Owing  to this configuration, its high table lands are without streams, a  phenomenon unknown in any other part of the world; while, in the  lower countries, the rivers, when swelled with the rains, spread into  floods and periodical lakes, or lose themselves in marshes. According  to this view of the probable structure of the unknown interior, it  appears as one immense flat mountain, rising on all sides from the  sea by terraces; an opinion favoured by the absence of those narrow  pointed promontories, in which other continents terminate, and of  those long chains of islands, which are, in fact, submarine  prolongations of mountain chains extending across the main land. It  is, however, not impossible, that in the centre of Africa, there may  be lofty table lands like those of Quito, or valleys like that of  Cashmeer, where, as in those happy regions, spring holds a perpetual  reign.    In regard to the population, as well as its geographical character,  Africa naturally divides itself into two great portions, north and  south of the mountains of Kong and the Jebel el Komar, which give  rise to the waters of the Senegal, the Niger and the Nile. To the  north of this line, Africa is ruled, and partially occupied by  foreign races, who have taken possession of all the fertile  districts, and driven the aboriginal population into the mountains  and deserts of the interior. It is consistent with general  experience, that in proportion as civilization extends itself, the  aboriginal race of the natives become either extinct, or are driven  farther and farther into the interior, where they in time are lost  and swept from the catalogue of the human race.    South of this line, we find Africa entirely peopled with the Negro  race, who alone seem capable of sustaining the fiery climate, by  means of a redundant physical energy scarcely compatible with the  full development of the intellectual powers of man. Central Africa is  a region distinguished from all others, by its productions and  climate, by the simplicity and yet barbarian magnificence of its  states; by the mildness and yet diabolical ferocity of its  inhabitants, and peculiarly by the darker nature of its  superstitions, and its magical rites, which have struck with awe  strangers in all ages, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#3)"],[1,"I        Recapitulation  A log prison begun  Various impositions practised at the store  October  Regulations and proceedings of the governor  A man found dead  A woman murdered  Discontents among the Irish, followed by an order  Character of the settlers at the river  Houses numbered at Sydney  Bennillong claims protection from the governor  Weather in October  November  Two victuallers arrive from England  Constables elected  The _Francis_ returns from Norfolk Island  Civil appointment  A criminal court held  Executions  One man hung in chains  Effect of this upon the natives  Public works  December  Convicts secreted on board the _Sylph_  Reflections  A general muster  Regulations  A native child murdered  Weather    1796.]  September.] In the former account of the English Colony of New  South Wales, which was brought up to the 29th September, 1796, it will be  seen, that on that day His Majesty's ship the _Reliance_ and the  _Britannia_ hired transport, sailed, with the _Francis_  colonial schooner, for Norfolk island; whence, being there joined by the  _Supply_, the _Reliance_ was to sail to the Cape of Good Hope,  to return with cattle for the colony, and the _Britannia_ was to  proceed to England.    The frequent commission of the most atrocious crimes, together with the  dissipated, turbulent, and abandoned disposition of the convicts, which  had more than ever at this time been manifest, determining the governor  to enforce the most rigid discipline, he resolved on constructing a  strong and capacious Log Prison at each of the towns of Sydney and  Parramatta. It being absolutely necessary that these should be erected as  expeditiously as possible, the safety of the inhabitants and security of  their property, rendering any delay extremely dangerous, and the public  gangs being very weak, he called upon every officer, settler, and  housekeeper within the above-mentioned districts, to furnish a certain  number of logs for this purpose, which were to be delivered at Sydney, or  Parramatta, as might be most convenient to each person's residence; and  he had, in a very short time, the satisfaction of seeing the materials  which were required brought in much faster than the carpenters could put  them together.    Among other crimes committed by these people, must be mentioned a variety  of impositions which were practised to deceive the commissary in the  issue of provisions. To detect these, an order was given about the end of  the month, which directed that every person belonging to each different  mess should attend personally at the store on the next serving-day. The  convicts had always been divided into messes, containing a certain number  of persons; one of whom out of each mess was to attend at the store, and  receive provisions for the whole number belonging to it.    On the day appointed, it appeared that many were victualled both at  Sydney and Parramatta, and several other impositions were detected and  abolished.    In a settlement which was still in a great measure dependant upon the  mother country for food, it might have been supposed that these people  would have endeavoured by their own industry to have increased, rather  than by robbery and fraud to have lessened, the means of their support:  but far too many of them were most incorrigibly flagitious. The most  notorious of these were formed into a gaol gang, which was composed of  such a set of hardened and worthless characters, that, although Saturday  was always given up to the convicts for their own private avocations, as  well as to enable them to appear clean and decent on Sunday at church,  this gang was ordered, as an additional punishment, to work on the  Saturday morning in repairing the roads and bridges near the town.    At the close of this month the stone tower of the Wind Mill, and the  stone foundation of the Log Prison, were much advanced.    October.] The governor, still turning his thoughts toward rectifying the  abuses which had imperceptibly crept into the colony, arranged in the  beginning of the following month (October) the muster lists which had  lately been taken; and, many more impositions being detected, he ordered  the delinquents to labour, after inflicting on them such punishments as  their respective offences seemed to demand; by which means he was enabled  considerably to increase the number of labouring people in the public  gangs. On his going up to Parramatta, whither he was attended by Captain  Johnston as his aid-de-camp, and Mr. Balmain (the surgeon) as a  magistrate, he recovered at least one hundred men for government work.    Exclusive of the advantage which attended the recruiting of the public  gangs in this way, another point was established by this examination, the  discovering of several who had been victualled from the stores beyond the  period (eighteen months) which had been fixed and considered by  government as a sufficient time to enable an industrious man to provide  for himself.    Directing his attention also toward the morality of the settlement, a  point which he could not venture to promise himself that he should ever  attain, he issued some necessary orders for enforcing attendance on  divine service, and had the satisfaction of seeing the Sabbath better  observed than it had been for some time past. But there were some who  were refractory. A fellow named Carroll, an Irishman, abused and ill  treated a constable who was on his duty, ordering the people to church;  saying, that he would neither obey the clergyman nor the governor; for  which, the next day, he was properly punished.    On the morning of the 16th, the people of a boat which had been sent to  the north shore for wood found a man's hat, and a large hammer lying by  it. One side of the hat had apparently been beaten in with the hammer,  which was bloody; and much blood was also found in the hat, as well as  about the spot where it was discovered. It was immediately conjectured,  that a man who had been working there with some carpenter's tools had  been murdered; and upon its being made known to the governor, he sent  several persons to search for the body, which was found thrown over the  cliff, and near the water side. On its being examined by the surgeons,  the skull was found beaten in, which must have been effected with the  hammer, and occasioned his death. Some suspicion falling upon two people,  they were secured, and an examination was the next day taken before the  magistrates; but nothing transpired that could fix the offence upon them.    This shocking circumstance was followed shortly after by another equally  atrocious: a murder which was committed by a man on the person of a woman  with whom he cohabited. It appeared that they had both been intoxicated,  and had quarrelled on the night preceding and in the morning of the murder.    This made the fifth circumstance of the kind which had occurred within  the last twelve months; and so excessively abandoned were the people,  that it was scarcely possible to obtain sufficient proof to convict the  offenders. Strong presumptive proof, indeed, was frequently adduced; but  the kind of evidence necessary to establish the offence was almost  constantly withheld.    About this time, some dissatisfaction appearing among the Irish convicts  who were ordered to labour, and some threats having been made use of by  them, the governor thought it necessary to inform the inhabitants of the  colony in general, that, after having pointed out a number of people who  had, by false pretences, and various impositions, obtained certificates  of discharge from the commissary's books, he did not expect so soon to  have occasion to enter again upon the same subject. He then, taking  notice of those who had not hesitated to hold a language which implied a  determination to resist all authority, declared, that if any officer,  civil or military, any settler, or other person within the colony,  should, after Monday, the 7th of November, retain in his or their service  any one or more of the persons described in a former order, such persons  should be considered as encouraging a set of lawless and seditious  people, to the total subversion of all order and government, and to the  weakening of His Majesty's authority in the settlement. He next informed  the people whose conduct had occasioned this order, that if they were of  opinion, that to threaten would be the best means of obtaining what they  desired, they might repent that opinion when too late. That there would  not be any difficulty found in furnishing them with a situation in the  colony, or in some of its dependencies, where they would not be able to  disturb the peace of their neighbours; and that if they were troublesome  here, they should certainly be placed in that situation very soon. He  concluded this order by informing all the inhabitants of the colony,  whether in a civil or a military capacity, that he expected, as they  valued His Majesty's authority, or the peace and civil government of the  settlement, that they would exert every effort to preserve good order;  and, to that end, that they should aid and assist the civil power when  and wherever it might be necessary, and report all such persons as they  might know to be in any way acting in opposition to this order.    It was hoped by the governor, that this order would convince the people  particularly styled defenders, that, if they continued to be troublesome,  they would not very readily escape from the punishment to which their  turbulent and restless conduct might entitle them.    From the accession of numbers to the public gangs, the different works in  hand at Sydney and Parramatta went rapidly on. At the former of these  places the erection of a granary, 72 feet in length and 22 in breadth,  was begun on the west side of the main street, there not being a building  for the reception of grain yet prepared in that township.    Boats were sent round "]]]
