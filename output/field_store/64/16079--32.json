Probably they don't care very profoundly for the  sermons; but they have got into a safe-sided, orthodox groove, and  some of them have an idea that they will be saved as much by church-  going as by faith. The members of this class have a large notion of  the respectability of their individual pews and seats. If they  belonged to a family of five hundred each, and if every one of them  had to go to Church every Sunday, they would want their respective  seats, Prayer Books, footstools, and all that sort of thing. They  don't like to see strangers rambling about, in search of a resting  place; they are particularly solemn-looking, and give symptoms of  being on the border of some catastrophe, if an unknown being shows  any disposition to enter their pews. And some of them would see a  person a good deal beyond the ether side of Jordan before they would  think of handing him a Prayer Book. We don't suppose any of them are  so precise as the old gentleman who once, when a stranger entered  his pew, doubled up the cushion, sat upon it in a two-fold state,  and intimated that ordinary beards were good enough for interlopers;  but after all there is much of the \"number one\" principle in the  devotion of these goodly followers of the saints, and they have been  so long at the game that a cure is impossible.    Taking the congregation of our Parish Church in the agregate it is a  fair sample of every class of human life. You have the old maid in  her unspotted, demurely-coloured moire antique, carrying a Prayer  Book belonging to a past generation; you have the ancient bachelor  with plenty of money and possessing a thorough knowledge as to the  safest way of keeping it, his great idea being that the best way of  getting to heaven is to stick to his coins, attend church every  Sunday, and take the sacrament regularly; you have the magistrate,  whose manner, if not his beard, is of formal cut; the retired  tradesman, with his domestic looking wife, and smartly-dressed  daughters, ten times finer than ever their mother was; the  manufacturer absorbed in cotton and wondering when he will be able  to do a good stroke of business on 'change again; the lawyer, who  has carried on a decent business amongst fees during the week, and  has perhaps turned up to join in the general confession; the doctor,  ready to give emphasis to that part of it which says:- \"And there is  no health in us;\" the pushing tradesman, who has to live by going to  church, as well as by counter work; the speculating shopkeeper, who  has a connection to make; the young finely-feathered lady, got up in  silk and velvet and carrying a chignon sufficient to pull her  cerebellum out of joint; the dandy buttoned up to show his figure,  and heavily dosed with scent; the less developed young swell, who is  always \"talking about his pa and his ma,\" and has only just begun to  have his hair parted down the middle; the broken down middle-aged  man who was once in a good position, but who years since went all in  a piece to pot; the snuff-loving old woman who curtsies before fine  folk, who has always a long tale to tell about her sorrows, and who  is periodically consoled by a \"trifle;\" the working man who is  rather a scarce article, except upon special occasions; and the  representative of the poorest class, living somewhere in that venal  slum of slime and misery behind the church. A considerable number of  those floating beings called \"strags\" attend the Parish Church. They  go to no place regularly; they gravitate at intervals to the church,  mainly on the ground that their fathers and mothers used to go  there, and because they were christened there; but they belong a  cunning race; they can scent the battle from afar, and they  generally keep about three-quarters of a mile from the Parish Church  when a collection has to be made. To the ordinary attendants,  collections do not operate as deterrents; but to the \"strags\" they  are frighteners. \"What's the reason there are so few people here?\"  we said one day to the beadle, and that most potent, grave, and  reverend seignior replied, with a Rogersonian sparkle in his rolling  eye, \"There's a collection and the 'strags' won't take the bait.\" It  is the same more or less at every place of worship; and to tell the  truth, there's a sort of instinctive dislike of collections in  everybody's composition.    The congregation of our Parish Church is tolerably numerous, and  embraces many fine human specimens. Money and fashion are well  represented at it; and as Zadkiel and the author of Pogmoor Almanac  say those powers have to rule for a long time, we may take it for  granted that the Parish Church will yet outlive many of the minor  raving academies in which they are absent. There is touch more  generalisation than there used to be as to the sittings in our  Parish Church; but \"birds of a feather flock together\" still. The  rich know their quarters; exquisite gentlemen and smart young ladies  with morrocco-bound gilt-edged Prayer Books still cluster in special  sections; and although it is said that the poor have the best part  of the church allotted to them, the conspicuousness of its position  gives a brand to it neither healthy nor pleasant. They are seated  down the centre aisle; but the place is too demonstrative of their  poverty. If half the seats were empty, situated excellently though  they may be, you wouldn't catch any respectable weasle asleep on  them. If some doctor, or magistrate, or private bib-and-tucker lady  had to anchor here, supposing there were any spare place in any  other part of the house, there would be a good deal of quizzing and  wonderment afloat. If you don't believe it put on a highly refined  dress and try the experiment; and if you are not very specially  spotted we wild give a fifty dollar greenback on behalf of the  society for converting missionary eaters in Chillingowullabadorie.  We shall say nothing with regard to the ordinary service of the  Parish Church, except this, that it would look better of three  fourths of the congregation if they would not leave the responses to  a paid choir. \"Lor, bless yer,\" as Betsy Jane Ward would say, a  choir will sing, anything put before them if it is set to music; and  they think no more of getting through all that sad business about  personal sinfulness, agonising repentance, and a general craving for  forgiveness, than the odd woman did when she used to kiss her cow  and say it was delicious. There was once a period when all Parish  Church goers made open confession joined audibly in the prayers, and  said \"Amen\" as if they meant it; although we are doubtful about even  that. Now, the choir does all the work, and the congregation are  left behind the distance post to think about the matter. But if it  suits the people it's quite right.    There are three parsons at our Parish Church--Canon Parr, who is the  seventeenth vicar in a regular line of succession since the  Reformation and two curates. As to the curates we shall say nothing  beyond this, that one has got a better situation and is going to it,  and that the other would like one if he could get it--not that the  present is at all bad, only that there are others better. We don't  know how many curates there have been at the Parish Church since the  Reformation; but it, may be safely said that in their turn they  have, as a rule, accepted with calm and Christian resignation better  paid places when they had a fair opportunity of getting them. We are  not going to say very much about Cannon Parr, and let nobody suppose  that we shall make an effort to tear a passion to tatters regarding  any of his peculiarities. Canon Parr is an easy-going, genial,  educated man kindly disposed towards good living, not blessed with  over much money, fond of wearing a billycock, and strongly in love  with a cloak. He has seen much of the world, is shrewd, has a long  head, has both studied and travelled for his learning, and is the  smartest man Preston Protestants could have to defend their cause.  But he has a certain amount of narrowness in his mental vision, and,  like the bulk of parsons, can see his own way best. He has a strong  temper within him, and he can redden up beautifully all over when  his equanimity is disturbed. If you tread upon his ecclesiastical  bunions he will give you either a dark mooner or an eye opener--we  use these classical terms in a figurative sense. He will keep quiet  so long as you do; but if you make an antagonistic move be will  punish you if possible. He can wield a clever pen; his style is  cogent, scholarly, and, unless overburdened with temper, dignified.  He can fling the shafts of satire or distil the balm of pathos; can  be bitter, saucy, and aggravating; can say a hard thing in a cutting  style; and if he does not go to the bone it's no fault of his. He  can also tone down his language to a point of elegance and  tenderness; can express a good thing excellently, and utter a fine  sentiment well. His speaking is modelled after a good style; but it  is inferior to his writing. In the pulpit he expresses himself  easily, often fervently, never rantingly. The pulpit of the Parish  Church will stand for ever before he upsets it, and he will never  approach that altitude of polemical phrenitis which will induce him  to smash any part of it. His pulpit language is invariably well  chosen; some of his subjects may be rather commonplace or  inappropriate, but the words thrown into their exposition are up to  the mark. He seldom falters; he has never above one, \"and now,  finally, brethren,\" in his concluding remarks; he invariably gives  over when he has done--a plan which John Wesley once said many  parsons neglected to observe; and his congregation, whether they  have been awake or fast asleep, generally go away satisfied.

Some modification of the  laws was then made. The political franchise was extended to all free  native Athenians. The command of the military forces was given to ten  generals, one from each tribe, instead of being intrusted to one of the  archons. The Ecclesia, a formal assembly of the citizens, met more  frequently. The people were called into direct action as _dikasts_, or  jurors; all citizens were eligible to the magistracy, even to the  archonship; ostracism,--which virtually was exile without  disgrace,--became a political necessity to check the ascendency of  demagogues.    Such were the main features of the constitution and jurisprudence of  Athens when the struggle between the patricians and plebeians of Rome  began, to which we now give our attention. It was the real beginning of  constitutional liberty in Rome. Before this time the government was in  the hands either of kings or aristocrats. The patricians were  descendants of the original Latin, Sabine, and Etruscan families; the  plebeians were the throng of common folk brought in by conquest or later  immigration,--mostly of Latin origin. The senate was the ruling power  after the expulsion of the kings, and senators were selected from the  great patrician families, who controlled by their wealth and influence  the popular elections, the army and navy, and all foreign relations.  Consuls, the highest magistrates, who commanded the armies, were  annually elected by the people; but for several centuries the consuls  belonged to great families. The constitution was essentially  aristocratic, and the aristocracy was based on wealth. Power was in the  hands of nobles, whether their ancestors were patricians or plebeians,  although in the early ages of the Republic they were mostly patricians  by birth. But with the growth of Rome new families that were not  descended from the ancient tribes became prominent,--like the Claudii,  the Julii, and the Servilii,--and were incorporated with the nobility.  There are very few names in Roman history before the time of Marius  which did not belong to this noble class. The _plebs_, or common people,  had at first no political privileges whatever, not even the right of  suffrage, and were not allowed to marry into patrician rank. Indeed,  they were politically and socially oppressed.    The first great event which gave the plebs protection and political  importance was the appointment of representatives called \"tribunes of  the people,\"--a privilege extorted from the patricians. The tribunes had  the right to be present at the deliberations of the senate; their  persons were inviolable, and they had the power of veto over obnoxious  laws. Their power continually increased, until they were finally elected  from the senatorial body. In 421 B.C. the plebs had gained sufficient  influence to establish the _connubium_, by which they were allowed to  intermarry with patricians. In the same year they were admitted to the  quaestorship, which office entitled the possessor to a seat in the  senate. The quaestors had charge of the public money. In 336 B.C. the  plebeians obtained the praetorship, a judicial office.    In the year 286 B.C. the distinctions vanished between plebeians and  patricians, and the term _populus_ instead of _plebs_, was applied to  all Roman people alike. Originally the _populus_ comprised strictly  Roman citizens, those who belonged to the original tribes, and who had  the right of suffrage. When the plebeians obtained access to the great  offices of the state, the senate represented the whole people as it  formerly represented the _populus_, and the term _populus_ was enlarged  to embrace the entire community.    The senate was an august body, and was very powerful. It was both  judicial and legislative, and for several centuries was composed of  patricians alone. Its members always belonged to the aristocracy,  whether of patrician or plebeian descent, and were supposed to be rich.  Under Augustus it required one million two hundred thousand sesterces  annually to support the senatorial dignity. The senate, the members of  which were chosen for life, had the superintendence of matters of  religion and foreign relations; it commanded the levies of troops; it  regulated duties and taxes; it gave audience to ambassadors; it  determined upon the way that war should be conducted; it decreed to what  provinces governors should be sent; it declared martial law in the  appointment of dictators; and it decreed triumphs to fortunate generals.  The senators, as a badge of distinction, wore upon their tunics a broad  purple stripe, and they had the privilege of the best seats in the  theatres. Their decisions were laws _(leges)._ A large part of them had  held curule offices, which entitled them to a seat in the senate for  life. The curule officers were the consuls, the praetors, the aediles,  the quaestors, the tribunes; so that an able senator was sure of a great  office in the course of his life. A man could scarcely be a senator  unless he had held a great office, nor could he often have held a great  office unless he were a senator. Thus it would seem that the Roman  constitution for three hundred years after the expulsion of the kings  was essentially aristocratic. The _plebs_ had but small consideration  till the time of the Gracchi.    But after the institution of tribunes a change in the constitution  gradually took place, so that it was neither aristocratic nor popular  exclusively, but was composed of both elements, and was a system of  balance of power between the various classes. The more complete the  balance of power, the closer is the resemblance to a constitutional  government. When one class acted as a check against another class, as  gradually came to pass, until the subversion of liberties by successful  generals, the senate, the magistrates, and the people in their  assemblies shared between them the political power, but the senate had a  preponderating influence. The judicial, the legislative, and the  executive authority was as well defined in Roman legislation as it is in  English or American. No person was above the authority of the laws; no  one class could subvert the liberties and prerogatives of another  class,--even the senate could not override the constitution. The  consuls, elected by the centuries, presided over the senate and over the  assemblies of the people. There was no absolute power exercised at Rome  until the subversion of the constitution, except by dictators chosen by  the senate in times of imminent danger. Nor could senators elect members  of their own body; the censors alone had the right of electing from the  ex-magistrates, and of excluding such as were unworthy. The consuls  could remain in office but a year, and could be called to account when  their terms of office had expired. The tribunes of the people ultimately  could prevent a consul from convening the senate, could seize a consul  and imprison him, and could veto an ordinance of the senate itself. The  nobles had no exclusive privilege like the feudal aristocracy of  mediaeval Europe, although it was their aim to secure the high  magistracies to the members of their own body. The term _nobilitas_  implied that some one of a man's ancestors had filled a curule  magistracy. A patrician, long before the reforms of the Gracchi, had  become a man of secondary importance, but the nobles were aristocrats to  the close of the republic, and continued to secure the highest offices;  they prevented their own extinction by admitting into their ranks those  who distinguished themselves,--that is, exercising their influence in  the popular elections to secure the magistracies from among themselves.    The Roman constitution then, as gradually developed by the necessities  and crises that arose, which I have not space to mention, was a  wonderful monument of human wisdom. The nobility were very powerful from  their wealth and influence, but the people were not ground down. There  were no oppressive laws to reduce them to practical slavery; what rights  they gained they retained. They constantly extorted new privileges,  until they were sufficiently powerful to be courted by demagogues. It  was the demagogues, generally aristocratic ones, like Catiline and  Caesar, who subverted the liberties of the people by buying votes. But  for nearly five hundred years not a man arose whom the Roman people  feared, and the proud symbol \"SPQR,\" on the standards of the armies of  the republic, bore the name of the Roman Senate and People to the ends  of the earth.    When, however, the senate came to be made up of men whom the great  generals selected; when the tribunes played into the hands of the very  men they were created to oppose; when the high-priest of a people,  originally religious, was chosen politically and without regard to moral  or religious consideration; when aristocratic nobles left their own  ranks to steal the few offices which the people controlled,--then the  constitution, under which the Romans had advanced to the conquest of the  world, became subverted, and the empire was a consolidated despotism.    Under the emperors there was no constitution, since they combined in  their own persons all the great offices of state, and controlled the  senate, the army, the tribunals of the law, the distant provinces, the  city itself, and regulated taxes and imposed burdens as they pleased.  The senate lost its independence, the courts their justice, the army its  spirit, and the people their hopes. And yet the old forms remained; the  senate met as in the days of the Gracchi, and there were consuls and  praetors as before.    However much we may deplore the subversion of the Roman constitution and  the absolute reign of the emperors, in which most historians see a  political necessity, there was yet under these emperors, whether good or  bad, the reign of law, the bequest of five hundred years' "]]]
