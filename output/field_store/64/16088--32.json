Chatter not, sublime reader, commonplaces of scoundrel moralists against  ambition. In some cases ambition is a hopeful virtue; in others (as in  the Rome of our resplendent Julius) ambition was the virtue by which any  other could flourish. It had become evident to everybody that Rome,  under its present constitution, must fall; and the sole question was--by  whom? Even Pompey, not by nature of an aspiring turn, and prompted to  his ambitious course undoubtedly by circumstances and, the friends who  besieged him, was in the habit of saying, \"Sylla potuit: ego non  potero?\" _Sylla found it possible: shall I find it not so?_ Possible to  do what? To overthrow the political system of the Republic. This had  silently collapsed into an order of things so vicious, growing also so  hopelessly worse, that all honest patriots invoked a purifying  revolution, even though bought at the heavy price of a tyranny, rather  than face the chaos of murderous distractions to which the tide of feuds  and frenzies was violently tending.    Such a revolution at such a price was not less Pompey's object than  Caesar's. In a case, therefore, where no benefit of choice was allowed  to Rome as respected the thing, but only as respected the person, Caesar  had the same right to enter the arena in the character of combatant as  could belong to any one of his rivals. And that he _did_ enter that  arena constructively, and by secret design, from his very earliest  manhood, may be gathered from this--that he suffered no openings towards  a revolution, provided they had any hope in them, to escape his  participation. It is familiarly known that he was engaged pretty deeply  in the conspiracy of Catiline, and that he incurred considerable risk on  that occasion; but it is less known that he was a party to at least two  other conspiracies. There was even a fourth, meditated by Crassus, which  Caesar so far encouraged as to undertake a journey to Rome from a very  distant quarter merely with a view to such chances as it might offer to  him; but, as it did not, upon examination, seem to him a very promising  scheme, he judged it best to look coldly upon it, or not to embark in it  by any personal co-operation. Upon these and other facts we build our  inference--that the scheme of a revolution was the one great purpose of  Caesar from his first entrance upon public life. Nor does it appear that  he cared much by whom it was undertaken, provided only there seemed to  be any sufficient resources for carrying it through, and for sustaining  the first collision with the regular forces of the existing oligarchies,  taking or _not_ taking the shape of triumvirates. He relied, it seems,  on his own personal superiority for raising him to the head of affairs  eventually, let who would take the nominal lead at first.    To the same result, it will be found, tended the vast stream of Caesar's  liberalities. From the senator downwards to the lowest _faex Romuli_, he  had a hired body of dependents, both in and out of Rome, equal in  numbers to a nation. In the provinces, and in distant kingdoms, he  pursued the same schemes. Everywhere he had a body of mercenary  partisans; kings even are known to have taken his pay. And it is  remarkable that even in his character of commander-in-chief, where the  number of legions allowed to him for the accomplishment of his Gaulish  mission raised him for a number of years above all fear of coercion or  control, he persevered steadily in the same plan of providing for the  distant day when he might need assistance, not _from_ the state, but  _against_ the state. For, amongst the private anecdotes which came to  light under the researches made into his history after his death, was  this--that, soon after his first entrance upon his government in Gaul,  he had raised, equipped, disciplined, and maintained, from his own  private funds, a legion amounting, possibly, to six or seven thousand  men, who were bound to no sacrament of military obedience to the state,  nor owed fealty to any auspices except those of Caesar. This legion,  from the fashion of their crested helmets, which resembled the heads of  a small aspiring bird, received the popular name of the _Alauda_ (or  Lark) legion. And very singular it was that Cato, or Marcellus, or some  amongst those enemies of Caesar who watched his conduct during the  period of his Gaulish command with the vigilance of rancorous malice,  should not have come to the knowledge of this fact; in which case we may  be sure that it would have been denounced to the Senate.    Such, then, for its purpose and its uniform motive, was the sagacious  munificence of Caesar. Apart from this motive, and considered in and for  itself, and simply with a reference to the splendid forms which it often  assumed, this munificence would furnish the materials for a volume. The  public entertainments of Caesar, his spectacles and shows, his  naumachiae, and the pomps of his unrivalled triumphs (the closing  triumphs of the Republic), were severally the finest of their kind which  had then been brought forward. Sea-fights were exhibited upon the  grandest scale, according to every known variety of nautical equipment  and mode of conflict, upon a vast lake formed artificially for that  express purpose. Mimic land-fights were conducted, in which all the  circumstances of real war were so faithfully rehearsed that even  elephants \"indorsed with towers,\" twenty on each side, took part in the  combat. Dramas were represented in every known language (_per omnium  linguarum histriones_). And hence (that is, from the conciliatory  feeling thus expressed towards the various tribes of foreigners resident  in Rome) some have derived an explanation of what is else a mysterious  circumstance amongst the ceremonial observances at Caesar's funeral--  that all people of foreign nations then residing at Rome distinguished  themselves by the conspicuous share which they took in the public  mourning; and that, beyond all other foreigners, the Jews for night  after night kept watch and ward about the Emperor's grave. Never before,  according to traditions which lasted through several generations in  Rome, had there been so vast a conflux of the human race congregated to  any one centre, on any one attraction of business or of pleasure, as to  Rome on occasion of these triumphal spectacles exhibited by Caesar.    In our days, the greatest occasional gatherings of the human race are in  India, especially at the great fair of the _Hurdwar_ on the Ganges in  northern Hindustan: a confluence of some millions is sometimes seen at  that spot, brought together under the mixed influences of devotion and  commercial business, but very soon dispersed as rapidly as they had been  convoked. Some such spectacle of nations crowding upon nations, and some  such Babylonian confusion of dresses, complexions, languages, and  jargons, was then witnessed at Rome. Accommodations within doors, and  under roofs of houses, or roofs of temples, was altogether impossible.  Myriads encamped along the streets, and along the high-roads, fields, or  gardens. Myriads lay stretched on the ground, without even the slight  protection of tents, in a vast circuit about the city. Multitudes of  men, even senators, and others of the highest rank, were trampled to  death in the crowds. And the whole family of man might seem at that time  to be converged at the bidding of the dead Dictator. But these, or any  other themes connected with the public life of Caesar, we notice only in  those circumstances which have been overlooked, or partially  represented, by historians. Let us now, in conclusion, bring forward,  from the obscurity in which they have hitherto lurked, the anecdotes  which describe the habits of his private life, his tastes, and personal  peculiarities.    In person, he was tall, fair, gracile, and of limbs distinguished for  their elegant proportions. His eyes were black and piercing. These  circumstances continued to be long remembered, and no doubt were  constantly recalled to the eyes of all persons in the imperial palaces  by pictures, busts, and statues; for we find the same description of his  personal appearance three centuries afterwards in a work of the Emperor  Julian's. He was a most accomplished horseman, and a master  (_peritissimus_) in the use of arms. But, notwithstanding his skill and  horsemanship, it seems that, when he accompanied his army on marches, he  walked oftener than he rode; no doubt, with a view to the benefit of his  example, and to express that sympathy with his soldiers which gained him  their hearts so entirely. On other occasions, when travelling apart from  his army, he seems more frequently to have ridden in a carriage than on  horseback. His purpose, in this preference, must have been with a view  to the transport of luggage. The carriage which he generally used was a  _rheda_, a sort of gig, or rather curricle; for it was a _four_-wheeled  carriage, and adapted (as we find from the imperial regulations for the  public carriages, etc.) to the conveyance of about half a ton. The mere  personal baggage which Caesar carried with him was probably  considerable; for he was a man of elegant habits, and in all parts of  his life sedulously attentive to elegance of personal appearance. The  length of journeys which he accomplished within a given time appears  even to us at this day, and might well therefore appear to his  contemporaries, truly astonishing. A distance of one hundred miles was  no extraordinary day's journey for him in a _rheda_, such as we have  described it. So refined were his habits, and so constant his demand for  the luxurious accommodations of polished life as it then existed in  Rome, that he is said to have carried with him, as indispensable parts  of his personal baggage, the little ivory lozenges, squares and circles  or ovals, with other costly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10661"],[0,"A Selection from the Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion (#3)"],[1,"God for  this? Because the gods have given the vine, or wheat, we sacrifice to  them; but because they have produced in the human mind that fruit by  which they designed to show us the truth which relates to happiness,  shall we not thank God for this?           *       *       *       *       *    AGAINST THE ACADEMICS.--If a man, said Epictetus, opposes evident  truths, it is not easy to find arguments by which we shall make him  change his opinion. But this does not arise either from the man's  strength or the teacher's weakness; for when the man, though he has been  confuted, is hardened like a stone, how shall we then be able to deal  with him by argument?    Now there are two kinds of hardening, one of the understanding, the  other of the sense of shame, when a man is resolved not to assent to  what is manifest nor to desist from contradictions. Most of us are  afraid of mortification of the body, and would contrive all means to  avoid such a thing, but we care not about the soul's mortification. And  indeed with regard to the soul, if a man be in such a state as not to  apprehend anything, or understand at all, we think that he is in a bad  condition; but if the sense of shame and modesty are deadened, this we  call even power (or strength).           *       *       *       *       *    OF PROVIDENCE.--From everything, which is or happens in the world, it is  easy to praise Providence, if a man possesses these two qualities: the  faculty of seeing what belongs and happens to all persons and things,  and a grateful disposition. If he does not possess these two qualities,  one man will not see the use of things which are and which happen:  another will not be thankful for them, even if he does know them. If God  had made colors, but had not made the faculty of seeing them, what would  have been their use? None at all. On the other hand, if he had made the  faculty of vision, but had not made objects such as to fall under the  faculty, what in that case also would have been the use of it? None at  all. Well, suppose that he had made both, but had not made light? In  that case, also, they would have been of no use. Who is it then who has  fitted this to that and that to this?    What, then, are these things done in us only? Many, indeed, in us only,  of which the rational animal had peculiar need; but you will find many  common to us with irrational animals. Do they then understand what is  done? By no means. For use is one thing, and understanding is another;  God had need of irrational animals to make use of appearances, but of us  to understand the use of appearances. It is therefore enough for them to  eat and to drink, and to copulate, and to do all the other things which  they severally do. But for us, to whom he has given also the  intellectual faculty, these things are not sufficient; for unless we act  in a proper and orderly manner, and conformably to the nature and  constitution of each thing, we shall never attain our true end. For  where the constitutions of living beings are different, there also the  acts and the ends are different. In those animals then whose  constitution is adapted only to use, use alone is enough; but in an  animal (man), which has also the power of understanding the use, unless  there be the due exercise of the understanding, he will never attain his  proper end. Well then God constitutes every animal, one to be eaten,  another to serve for agriculture, another to supply cheese, and another  for some like use; for which purposes what need is there to understand  appearances and to be able to distinguish them? But God has introduced  man to be a spectator of God and of his works; and not only a spectator  of them, but an interpreter. For this reason it is shameful for man to  begin and to end where irrational animals do; but rather he ought to  begin where they begin, and to end where nature ends in us; and nature  ends in contemplation and understanding, and in a way of life  conformable to nature. Take care then not to die without having been  spectators of these things.    But you take a journey to Olympia to see the work of Phidias, and all of  you think it a misfortune to die without having seen such things. But  when there is no need to take a journey, and where a man is, there he  has the works (of God) before him, will you not desire to see and  understand them? Will you not perceive either what you are, or what you  were born for, or what this is for which you have received the faculty  of sight? But you may say, There are some things disagreeable and  troublesome in life. And are there none at Olympia? Are you not  scorched? Are you not pressed by a crowd? Are you not without  comfortable means of bathing? Are you not wet when it rains? Have you  not abundance of noise, clamor, and other disagreeable things? But I  suppose that setting all these things off against the magnificence of  the spectacle, you bear and endure. Well then and have you not received  faculties by which you will be able to bear all that happens? Have you  not received greatness of soul? Have you not received manliness? Have  you not received endurance? And why do I trouble myself about anything  that can happen if I possess greatness of soul? What shall distract my  mind, or disturb me, or appear painful? Shall I not use the power for  the purposes for which I received it, and shall I grieve and lament over  what happens?    Come, then, do you also having observed these things look to the  faculties which you have, and when you have looked at them, say: Bring  now, O Zeus, any difficulty that thou pleasest, for I have means given  to me by thee and powers for honoring myself through the things which  happen. You do not so; but you sit still, trembling for fear that some  things will happen, and weeping, and lamenting, and groaning for what  does happen; and then you blame the gods. For what is the consequence of  such meanness of spirit but impiety? And yet God has not only given us  these faculties, by which we shall be able to bear everything that  happens without being depressed or broken by it; but, like a good king  and a true father, He has given us these faculties free from hindrance,  subject to no compulsion, unimpeded, and has put them entirely in our  own power, without even having reserved to Himself any power of  hindering or impeding. You, who have received these powers free and as  your own, use them not; you do not even see what you have received, and  from whom; some of you being blinded to the giver, and not even  acknowledging your benefactor, and others, through meanness of spirit,  betaking yourselves to fault-finding and making charges against God. Yet  I will show to you that you have powers and means for greatness of soul  and manliness; but what powers you have for finding fault making  accusations, do you show me.           *       *       *       *       *    HOW FROM THE FACT THAT WE ARE AKIN TO GOD A MAN MAY PROCEED TO THE  CONSEQUENCES.--I indeed think that the old man ought to be sitting here,  not to contrive how you may have no mean thoughts nor mean and ignoble  talk about yourselves, but to take care that there be not among us any  young men of such a mind, that when they have recognized their kinship  to God, and that we are fettered by these bonds, the body, I mean, and  its possessions, and whatever else on account of them is necessary to us  for the economy and commerce of life, they should intend to throw off  these things as if they were burdens painful and intolerable, and to  depart to their kinsmen. But this is the labor that your teacher and  instructor ought to be employed upon, if he really were what he should  be. You should come to him and say: Epictetus, we can no longer endure  being bound to this poor body, and feeding it, and giving it drink and  rest, and cleaning it, and for the sake of the body complying with the  wishes of these and of those. Are not these things indifferent and  nothing to us; and is not death no evil? And are we not in a manner  kinsmen of God, and did we not come from him? Allow us to depart to the  place from which we came; allow us to be released at last from these  bonds by which we are bound and weighed down. Here there are robbers and  thieves and courts of justice, and those who are named tyrants, and  think that they have some power over us by means of the body and its  possessions. Permit us to show them that they have no power over any  man. And I on my part would say: Friends, wait for God: when he shall  give the signal and release you from this service, then go to him; but  for the present endure to dwell in this place where he has put you.  Short indeed is this time of your dwelling here, and easy to bear for  those who are so disposed; for what tyrant, or what thief, or what  courts of justice are formidable to those who have thus considered as  things of no value the body and the possessions of the body? Wait then,  do not depart without a reason.           *       *       *       *       *    OF CONTENTMENT.--With respect to gods, there are some who say that a  divine being does not exist; others say that it exists, but is inactive  and careless, and takes no forethought about anything; a third class say  that such a being exists and exercises forethought, but only about great  things and heavenly things, and about nothing on the earth; a fourth  class say that a divine being exercises forethought both about things on  the earth and heavenly things, but in a general way only, and not about  things severally. There is a fifth class to whom Ulysses and Socrates  belong, who say:      I move not without thy knowledge.--Iliad, x., 278.    Before all other things then it is necessary to inquire about each of  these opinions, whether it is affirmed truly or not truly. For if there  are no gods, how is it our proper end to follow them? And if they exist,  but take no care of anything, in this case"]]]
