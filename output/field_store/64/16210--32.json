the field of philosophy are  but very imperfectly known to the world at large, and it is unfortunate  that the condition is no better even in India. There is a small body  of Hindu scholars and ascetics living a retired life in solitude, who  are well acquainted with the subject, but they do not know English and  are not used to modern ways of thinking, and the idea that they ought  to write books in vernaculars in order to popularize the subject does  not appeal to them. Through the activity of various learned bodies and  private individuals both in Europe and in India large numbers of  philosophical works in Sanskrit and Pali have been published, as well as  translations of a few of them, but there has been as yet little  systematic attempt on the part of scholars to study them and judge their  value. There are hundreds of Sanskrit works on most of the systems of  Indian thought and scarcely a hundredth part of them has been translated.  Indian modes of expression, entailing difficult technical philosophical  terms are so different from those of European thought, that they can  hardly ever be accurately translated. It is therefore very difficult  for a person unacquainted with Sanskrit to understand Indian philosophical  thought in its true bearing from translations. Pali is a much easier  language than Sanskrit, but a knowledge of Pali is helpful in  understanding only the earliest school of Buddhism, when it was in its  semi-philosophical stage. Sanskrit is generally regarded as a difficult  language. But no one from an acquaintance with Vedic or ordinary literary  Sanskrit can have any idea of the difficulty of the logical and abstruse  parts of Sanskrit philosophical literature. A man who can easily  understand the Vedas. the Upani@sads, the Puranas, the Law Books and  the literary works, and is also well acquainted with European  philosophical thought, may find it literally impossible to understand  even small portions of a work of advanced Indian logic, or the  dialectical Vedanta. This is due to two reasons, the use of  technical terms and of great condensation in expression, and  the hidden allusions to doctrines of other systems. The    2    tendency to conceiving philosophical problems in a clear and unambiguous  manner is an important feature of Sanskrit thought, but from the ninth  century onwards, the habit of using clear, definite, and precise  expressions, began to develop in a very striking manner, and as a result  of that a large number of technical terms began to be invented. These  terms are seldom properly explained, and it is presupposed that the reader  who wants to read the works should have a knowledge of them. Any one in  olden times who took to the study of any system of philosophy, had to do  so with a "]]]
