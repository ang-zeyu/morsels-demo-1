As I had written to  my mother that she might expect me in Scotland, I was under the  necessity of continuing my journey.  His disease seemed to yield to  exercise and change of air, and when he arrived in London, he was  apparently in much better health  than when he left Edinburgh.  He was  advised to go to Bath to drink the waters, which appeared for some  time to have so good an effect upon him, that even he himself began to  entertain, what he was not apt to do, a better opinion of his own  health.  His symptoms, however, soon returned with their usual  violence, and from that moment he gave up all thoughts of recovery,  but submitted with the utmost cheerfulness, and the most perfect  complacency and resignation.  Upon his return to Edinburgh, though he  found himself much weaker, yet his cheerfulness never abated, and he  continued to divert himself, as usual, with correcting his own works  for a new edition, with reading books of amusement, with the  conversation of his friends, and sometimes in the evening with a party  at his favourite game of whist.  His cheerfulness was so great, and  his conversation and amusements ran so much in their usual strain,  that, notwithstanding all bad symptoms, many people could not believe  he was dying.  \"I shall tell your friend, Colonel Edmonstone,\" said  Doctor Dundas to him one day, \"that I left you much better, and in a  fair way of recovery.\" \"Doctor,\" said he, \"as I believe you would not  choose to tell any thing but the truth, you had better tell him, that  I am dying as fast as my enemies, if I have any, could wish, and as  easily and cheerfully as my best friends could desire.\"  Colonel  Edmonstone soon afterwards came to see him, and take leave of him; and  on his way home he could not forbear writing him a letter, bidding him  once more an eternal adieu, and applying to him, as to a dying man,  the beautiful French verses in which the Abbe Chaulieu, in expectation  of his own death, laments his approaching separation from his friend  the Marquis de la Fare.  Mr. Hume's magnanimity and firmness were  such, that his most affectionate friends knew that they hazarded  nothing in talking or writing to him as to a dying man, and that, so  far from being hurt by this frankness, he was rather pleased and  flattered by it.  I happened to come into his room while he was  reading this letter, which he had just received, and which he  immediately showed me.  I told him, that though I was sensible how  very much he was weakened, and that appearances were in many respects  very bad, yet his cheerfulness was still so great, the spirit of life  seemed still to be so very strong in him,  that I could not help  entertaining some faint hopes.  He answered, \"Your hopes are  groundless.  An habitual diarrhoea of more than a year's standing  would be a very bad disease at any age: at my age it is a mortal one.  When I lie down in the evening I feel myself weaker than when I rose  in the morning, and when I rise in the morning weaker than when I lay  down in the evening.  I am sensible, besides, that some of my vital  parts are affected, so that I must soon die.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"if it  must be so, you have at least the satisfaction of leaving all your  friends, your brother's family in particular, in great prosperity.\"  He said that he felt that satisfaction so sensibly, that when he was  reading, a few days before, Lucian's Dialogues of the Dead, among all  the excuses which are alleged to Charon for not entering readily into  his boat, he could not find one that fitted him; he had no house to  finish, he had no daughter to provide for, he had no enemies upon whom  he wished to revenge himself.  \"I could not well imagine,\" said he,  \"what excuse I could make to Charon in order to  obtain a little  delay.  I have done every thing of consequence which I ever meant to  do, and I could at no time expect to leave my relations and friends in  a better situation than that in which I am now likely to leave them: I  therefore have all reason to die contented.\"  He then diverted himself  with inventing several jocular excuses, which he supposed he might  make to Charon, and with imagining the very surly answers which it  might suit the character of Charon to return to them.  \"Upon further  consideration,\" said he, \"I thought I might say to him, 'Good Charon,  I have been correcting my works for a new edition.  Allow me a little  time, that I may see how the public receives the alterations.'  But  Charon would answer, 'When you have seen the effect of these, you will  be for making other alterations.  There will be no end of such  excuses; so, honest friend, please step into the boat.'  But I might  still urge, 'Have a little patience, good Charon, I have been  endeavouring to open the eyes of the public.  If I live a few years  longer, I may have the satisfaction of seeing the downfall of some of  the prevailing systems of superstition.'  But Charon would then lose  all temper and decency--'You loitering rogue, that will not happen  these many hundred years.  Do you fancy I will grant you a lease for  so long a term?  Get into the boat this instant, you lazy, loitering  rogue.'\"    But though Mr. Hume always talked of his approaching dissolution with  great cheerfulness, he never affected to make any parade of his  magnanimity.  He never mentioned the subject, but when the  conversation naturally led to it, and never dwelt longer upon it than  the course of the conversation happened to require.  It was a subject,  indeed, which occurred pretty frequently, in consequence of the  inquiries which his friends, who came to see him, naturally made  concerning the state of his health.  The conversation which I  mentioned above, and which passed on Thursday the 8th of August, was  the last, except one, that I ever had with him.  He had now become so  very weak, that the company of his most intimate friends fatigued him;  for his cheerfulness was still so great, his complaisance and social  disposition were still so entire, that when any friend was with him,  he could not help talking more, and with greater exertion, than suited  the weakness of his body.  At his own desire, therefore, I agreed to  leave Edinburgh, where I was staying partly upon his account, and  returned to my mother's house here, at Kirkaldy, upon condition that  he would send for me whenever he wished to see me; the physician who  saw him most frequently, Dr. Black, undertaking in the mean time to  write me occasionally an account of the state of his health.    On the 22d of August, the doctor wrote me the following letter:    \"Since my last, Mr. Hume has passed his time pretty easily, but is  much weaker.  He sits up, goes down stairs once a day, and amuses  himself with reading, but seldom sees any body.  He finds, that the  conversation of his most intimate friends fatigues and oppresses him;  and it is happy that he does not need it, for he is quite free from  anxiety, impatience, or low spirits, and passes his time very well  with the assistance of amusing books.\"    I received the day after a letter from Mr. Hume himself, of which the  following is an extract:    \"Edinburgh, Aug. 23, 1776    \"MY DEAREST FRIEND,    \"I am obliged to make use of my nephew's hand in writing to you, as I  do not rise to-day. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *    \"I go very fast to decline, and last night had a small fever, which I  hoped might put a quicker period to this tedious illness; but,  unluckily, it has in a great measure gone off.  I cannot submit to  your coming over here on my account, as it is possible for me to see  you so small a part of the day; but Dr. Black can better inform you  concerning the degree of strength which may from time to time remain  with me.    \"Adieu, &c.\"    Three days after, I received the following letter from Dr. Black:    \"Edinburgh, Monday, Aug. 26, 1776.    \"DEAR SIR,    \"Yesterday, about four o'clock, afternoon, Mr. Hume expired.  The near  approach of his death became evident in the night between Thursday and  Friday, when his disease became excessive, and soon weakened him so  much, that he could no longer rise out of his bed.  He continued to  the last perfectly sensible, and free from much pain or feelings of  distress.  He never dropped the smallest expression of impatience; but  when he had occasion to speak to the people about him, always did it  with affection and tenderness.  I thought it improper to write to  bring you over, especially as I heard that he had dictated a letter to  you, desiring you not to come.  When he became very weak, it cost him  an effort to speak, and he died in such a happy composure of mind that  nothing could exceed it.\"    Thus died our most excellent and never to be forgotten friend;  concerning whose philosophical opinions men will no doubt judge  variously, every one approving or condemning them, according as they  happen to coincide or disagree with his own; but concerning whose  character and conduct there can scarce be a difference of opinion.  His temper, indeed, seemed to be more happily balanced, if I may be  allowed such an expression, than that perhaps of any other man I have  ever known.  Even in the lowest state of his fortune, his great and  necessary frugality never hindered him from exercising, upon proper  occasions, acts both of charity and generosity.  It was a frugality  founded not upon avarice, but upon the love of independency.  The  extreme gentleness of his nature never weakened either the firmness of  his mind, or the steadiness of his resolutions.  His constant  pleasantry was the genuine effusion of good-nature and good-humour,  tempered with delicacy and modesty, and without even the slightest  tincture of malignity, so frequently the disagreeable source of what  is called wit"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10580"],[0,"The Positive School of Criminology (#3)"],[1,"the above named men  of science accomplished for the treatment of the insane. The general  opinion of classic criminalists and of the people at large is that crime  involves a moral guilt, because it is due to the free will of the  individual who leaves the path of virtue and chooses the path of crime,  and therefore it must be suppressed by meeting it with a proportionate  quantity of punishment. This is to this day the current conception of  crime. And the illusion of a free human will (the only miraculous factor  in the eternal ocean of cause and effect) leads to the assumption that  one can choose freely between virtue and vice. How can you still believe  in the existence of a free will, when modern psychology armed with all  the instruments of positive modern research, denies that there is any  free will and demonstrates that every act of a human being is the  result of an interaction between the personality and the environment of  man?    And how is it possible to cling to that obsolete idea of moral guilt,  according to which every individual is supposed to have the free choice  to abandon virtue and give himself up to crime? The positive school of  criminology maintains, on the contrary, that it is not the criminal who  wills; in order to be a criminal it is rather necessary that the  individual should find himself permanently or transitorily in such  personal, physical and moral conditions, and live in such an  environment, which become for him a chain of cause and effect,  externally and internally, that disposes him toward crime. This is our  conclusion, which I anticipate, and it constitutes the vastly different  and opposite method, which the positive school of criminology employs as  compared to the leading principle of the classic school of criminal  science.    In this method, this essential principle of the positive school of  criminology, you will find another reason for the seemingly slow advance  of this school. That is very natural. If you consider the great reform  carried by the ideas of Cesare Beccaria into the criminal justice of  the Middle Age, you will see that the great classic school represents  but a small step forward, because it leaves the penal justice on the  same theoretical and practical basis which it had in the Middle Age and  in classic antiquity, that is to say, based on the idea of a moral  responsibility of the individual. For Beccaria, for Carrara, for their  predecessors, this idea is no more nor less than that mentioned in books  47 and 48 of the Digest: \"The criminal is liable to punishment to the  extent that he is morally guilty of the crime he has committed.\" The  entire classic school is, therefore, nothing but a series of reforms.  Capital punishment has been abolished in some countries, likewise  torture, confiscation, corporal punishment. But nevertheless the immense  scientific movement of the classic school has remained a mere reform.    It has continued in the 19th century to look upon crime in the same way  that the Middle Age did: \"Whoever commits murder or theft, is alone the  absolute arbiter to decide whether he wants to commit the crime or not.\"  This remains the foundation of the classic school of criminology. This  explains why it could travel on its way more rapidly than the positive  school of criminology. And yet, it took half a century from the time of  Beccaria, before the penal codes showed signs of the reformatory  influence of the classic school of criminology. So that it has also  taken quite a long time to establish it so well that it became accepted  by general consent, as it is today. The positive school of criminology  was born in 1878, and although it does not stand for a mere reform of  the methods of criminal justice, but for a complete and fundamental  transformation of criminal justice itself, it has already gone quite a  distance and made considerable conquests which begin to show in our  country. It is a fact that the penal code now in force in this country  represents a compromise, so far as the theory of personal responsibility  is concerned, between the old theory of free will and the conclusions of  the positive school which denies this free will.    You can find an illustration of this in the eloquent contortions of  phantastic logic in the essays on the criminal code written by a great  advocate of the classic school of criminology, Mario Pagano, this  admirable type of a scientist and patriot, who does not lock himself up  in the quiet egoism of his study, but feels the ideal of his time  stirring within him and gives up his life to it. He has written three  lines of a simple nudity that reveals much, in which he says: \"A man is  responsible for the crimes which he commits; if, in committing a crime,  his will is half free, he is responsible to the extent of one-half; if  one-third, he is responsible one-third.\" There you have the  uncompromising and absolute classic theorem. But in the penal code of  1890, you will find that the famous article 45 intends to base the  responsibility for a crime on the simple will, to the exclusion of the  free will. However, the Italian judge has continued to base the exercise  of penal justice on the supposed existence of the free will, and  pretends not to know that the number of scientists denying the free will  is growing. Now, how is it possible that so terrible an office as that  of sentencing criminals retains its stability or vacillates, according  to whether the first who denies the existence of a free will deprives  this function of its foundation?    Truly, it is said that this question has been too difficult for the new  Italian penal code. And, for this reason, it was thought best to base  the responsibility for a crime on the idea that a man is guilty simply  for the reason that he wanted to commit the crime; and that he is not  responsible if he did not want to commit it. But this is an eclectic way  out of the difficulty, which settles nothing, for in the same code we  have the rule that involuntary criminals are also punished, so that  involuntary killing and wounding are punished with imprisonment the same  as voluntary deeds of this kind. We have heard it said in such cases  that the result may not have been intended, but the action bringing it  about was. If a hunter shoots through a hedge and kills or wounds a  person, he did not intend to kill, and yet he is held responsible  because his first act, the shooting, was voluntary.    That statement applies to involuntary crimes, which are committed by  some positive act. But what about involuntary crimes of omission? In a  railway station, where the movements of trains represent the daily whirl  of traffic in men, things, and ideas, every switch is a delicate  instrument which may cause a derailment. The railway management places a  switchman on duty at this delicate post. But in a moment of fatigue, or  because he had to work inhumanly long hours of work, which exhausted all  his nervous elasticity, or for other reasons, the switchman forgets to  set the switch and causes a railroad accident, in which people are  killed and wounded. Can it be said that he intended the first act?  Assuredly not, for he did not intend anything and did not do anything.  The hunter who fires a shot has at least had the intention of shooting.  But the switchman did not want to forget (for in that case he would be  indirectly to blame); he has simply forgotten from sheer fatigue to do  his duty; he has had no intention whatever, and yet you hold him  responsible in spite of all that! The fundamental logic of your  reasoning in this case corresponds to the logic of the things. Does it  not happen every day in the administration of justice that the judges  forget about the neutral expedient of the legislator who devised this  relative progress of the penal code, which pretends to base the  responsibility of a man on the neutral and naive criterion of a will  without freedom of will? Do they not follow their old mental habits in  the administration of justice and apply the obsolete criterion of the  free will, which the legislator thought fit to abandon? We see, then,  as a result of this imperfect and insincere innovation in penal  legislation this flagrant contradiction, that the magistrates assume the  existence of a free will, while the legislator has decided that it shall  not be assumed. Now, in science as well as in legislation, we should  follow a direct and logical line, such as that of the classic school or  the positive school of criminology. But whoever thinks he has solved a  problem when he gives us a solution which is neither fish nor fowl,  comes to the most absurd and iniquitous conclusions. You see what  happens every day. If to-morrow some beastly and incomprehensible crime  is committed, the conscience of the judge is troubled by this question:  Was the person who committed this crime morally free to act or not? He  may also invoke the help of legislation, and he may take refuge in  article 46,[A] or in that compromise of article 47,[B] which admits  a responsibility of one-half or one-third, and he would decide on a  penalty of one-half or one-third.    All this may take place in the case of a grave and strange crime. And on  the other hand, go to the municipal courts or to the police courts,  where the magic lantern of justice throws its rays upon the nameless  human beings who have stolen a bundle of wood in a hard winter, or who  have slapped some one in the face during a brawl in a saloon.  And if they should find a defending lawyer who would demand the  appointment of a medical expert, watch the reception he would get from  the judge. When justice is surprised by a beastly and strange crime, it  feels the entire foundation of its premises shaking, it halts for a  moment, it calls in the help of legal medicine, and reflects before it  sentences. But in the case of those poor nameless creatures, justice  does not "]]]
