The shadow convulsed as shadows are apt to swirl in a green pool when a  stone is dropped into it; and a bit of board two feet long and some  eight inches wide cracked against the shins of Lefty Joe.    It was about the least dramatic weapon that could have been chosen under  those circumstances, but certainly no other defense could have  frustrated Lefty's spring so completely. Instead of launching out in a  compact mass whose point of contact was the reaching knife, Lefty  crawled stupidly forward upon his knees, and had to throw out his knife  hand to save his balance.    It is a singular thing to note how important balance is to men. Animals  fight, as a rule, just as well on their backs as they do on their feet.  They can lie on their sides and bite; they can swing their claws even  while they are dropping through the air. But man needs poise and balance  before he can act. What is speed in a fighter? It is not so much an  affair of the muscles as it is the power of the brain to adapt itself  instantly to each new move and put the body in a state of balance. In  the prize ring speed does not mean the ability to strike one lightning  blow, but rather that, having finished one drive, the fighter is in  position to hit again, and then again, so that no matter where the  impetus of his last lunge has placed him he is ready and poised to shoot  all his weight behind his fist again and drive it accurately at a  vulnerable spot. Individually the actions may be slow; but the series of  efforts seem rapid. That is why a superior boxer seems to hypnotize his  antagonist with movements which to the spectator seem perfectly easy,  slow, and sure.    But if Lefty lacked much in agility, he had an animallike sense of  balance. Sprawling, helpless, he saw the convulsed shadow that was  Donnegan take form as a straight shooting body that plunged through the  air above him. Lefty Joe dug his left elbow into the floor of the car  and whirled back upon his shoulders, bunching his knees high over his  stomach. Nine chances out of ten, if Donnegan had fallen flatwise upon  this alert enemy, he would have received those knees in the pit of his  own stomach and instantly been paralyzed. But in the jumping, rattling  car even Donnegan was capable of making mistakes. His mistake in this  instance saved his life, for springing too far, he came down not in  reaching distance of Lefty's throat, but with his chest on the knees of  the older tramp.    As a result, Donnegan was promptly kicked head over heels and tumbled  the length of the car. Lefty was on his feet and plunging after the  tumbling form in the twinkling of an eye, literally speaking, and he was  only kept from burying his knife in the flesh of his foe by a sway of  the car that staggered him in the act of striking. Donnegan, the next  instant, was beyond reach. He had struck the end of the car and  rebounded like a ball of rubber at a tangent. He slid into the shadows,  and Lefty, putting his own shoulders to the wall, felt for his revolver  and knew that he was lost. He had failed in his first surprise attack,  and without surprise to help him now he was gone. He weighed his  revolver, decided that it would be madness to use it, for if he missed,  Donnegan would instantly be guided by the flash to shoot him full of  holes.    Something slipped by the open door--something that glimmered faintly;  and Lefty Joe knew that it was the red head of Donnegan. Donnegan,  soft-footed as a shadow among shadows. Donnegan on a blood trail. It  lowered the heartbeat of Lefty Joe to a tremendous, slow pulse. In that  moment he gave up hope and, resigning himself to die, determined to  fight to the last gasp, as became one of his reputation and national  celebrity on \"the road.\"    Yet Lefty Joe was no common man and no common fighter. No, let the shade  of Rusty Dick, whom Lefty met and beat in his glorious prime--let this  shade arise and speak for the prowess of Lefty Joe. In fact it was  because he was such a good fighter himself that he recognized his  helplessness in the hands of Donnegan.    The faint glimmer of color had passed the door. It was dissolved in  deeper shadows at once, and soundlessly; Lefty knew that Donnegan was  closer and closer.    Of one thing he felt more and more confident, that Donnegan did not have  his revolver with him. Otherwise, he would have used it before. For what  was darkness to this devil, Donnegan. He walked like a cat, and most  likely he could see like a cat in the dark. Instinctively the older  tramp braced himself with his right hand held at a guard before his  breast and the knife poised in his left, just as a man would prepare to  meet the attack of a panther. He even took to probing the darkness in a  strange hope to catch the glimmer of the eyes of Donnegan as he moved to  the attack. If there were a hair's breadth of light, then Donnegan  himself must go down. A single blow would do it.    But the devil had instructed his favorite Donnegan how to fight. He did  not come lunging through the shadows to meet the point of that knife.  Instead, he had worked a snaky way along the floor and now he leaped in  and up at Lefty, taking him under the arms.    A dozen hands, it seemed, laid hold on Lefty. He fought like a demon and  tore himself away, but the multitude of hands pursued him. They were  small hands. Where they closed they tore the clothes and bit into his  very flesh. Once a hand had him by the throat, and when Lefty jerked  himself away it was with a feeling that his flesh had been seared by  five points of red-hot iron. All this time his knife was darting; once  it ripped through cloth, but never once did it find the target. And half  a second later Donnegan got his hold. The flash of the knife as Lefty  raised it must have guided the other. He shot his right hand up behind  the left shoulder of the other and imprisoned the wrist. Not only did it  make the knife hand helpless, but by bearing down with his own weight  Donnegan could put his enemy in most exquisite torture.    For an instant they whirled; then they went down, and Lefty was on top.  Only for a moment. The impetus which had sent him to the floor was used  by Donnegan to turn them over, and once fairly on top his left hand was  instantly at the throat of Lefty.    Twice Lefty made enormous efforts, but then he was done. About his body  the limbs of Donnegan were twisted, tightening with incredible force;  just as hot iron bands sink resistlessly into place. The strangle-hold  cut away life at its source. Once he strove to bury his teeth in the arm  of Donnegan. Once, as the horror caught at him, he strove to shriek for  help. All he succeeded in doing was in raising an awful, sobbing  whisper. Then, looking death in the face, Lefty plunged into the great  darkness.          4      When he wakened, he jumped at a stride into the full possession of his  faculties. He had been placed near the open door, and the rush of night  air had done its work in reviving him. But Lefty, drawn back to life,  felt only a vague wonder that his life had not been taken. Perhaps he  was being reserved by the victor for an Indian death of torment. He felt  cautiously and found that not only were his hands free, but his revolver  had not been taken from him. A familiar weight was on his chest--the  very knife had been returned to its sheath.    Had Donnegan returned these things to show how perfectly he despised his  enemy?    \"He's gone!\" groaned the tramp, sitting up quickly.    \"He's here,\" said a voice that cut easily through the roar of the train.  \"Waiting for you, Lefty.\"    The tramp was staggered again. But then, who had ever been able to  fathom the ways of Donnegan?    \"Donnegan!\" he cried with a sudden recklessness.    \"Yes?\"    \"You're a fool!\"    \"Yes?\"    \"For not finishing the job.\"    Donnegan began to laugh. In the uproar of the train it was impossible  really to hear the sound, but Lefty caught the pulse of it. He fingered  his bruised throat; swallowing was a painful effort. And an  indescribable feeling came over him as he realized that he sat armed to  the teeth within a yard of the man he wanted to kill, and yet he was as  effectively rendered helpless as though iron shackles had been locked on  his wrists and legs. The night light came through the doorway, and he  could make out the slender outline of Donnegan and again he caught the  faint luster of that red hair; and out of the shadowy form a singular  power emanated and sapped his strength at the root.    Yet he went on viciously: \"Sooner or later, Donnegan, I'll get you!\"    The red head of Donnegan moved, and Lefty Joe knew that the younger man  was laughing again.    \"Why are you after me?\" he asked at length.    It was another blow in the face of Lefty. He sat for a time blinking  with owlish stupidity.    \"Why?\" he echoed. And he spoke his astonishment from the heart.    \"Why am I after you?\" he said again. \"Why, confound you, ain't you  Donnegan?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Don't the whole road know that I'm after you and you after me?\"    \"The whole road is crazy. I'm not after you.\"    Lefty choked.    \"Maybe I been dreaming. Maybe you didn't bust up the gang? Maybe you  didn't clean up on Suds and Kennebec?\"    \"Suds? Kennebec? I sort of remember meeting them.\"    \"You sort of--the devil!\" Lefty Joe sputtered the words. \"And after you  cleaned up my crowd, ain't it natural and good sense for you to go on  and try to clean up on me?\"    \"Sounds like it.\"    \"But I figured to beat you to it. I cut in on your trail, Donnegan, and  before I leave it you'll know a lot more about me.\"    \"You're warning me ahead of time?\"    \"You've played this game square with me; I'll play square with you.  Next time there'll be no slips, Donnegan. I dunno why you should of  picked on me, though. Just the natural devil in you.\"    \"I haven't picked on you,\" said Donnegan.    \"What?\"    \"I'll give you my word.\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1007"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Paradise (#3)"],[1,"I the first  Of that will treat which hath the more of gall.  Of seraphim he who is most ensky'd,  Moses and Samuel, and either John,  Choose which thou wilt, nor even Mary's self,  Have not in any other heav'n their seats,  Than have those spirits which so late thou saw'st;  Nor more or fewer years exist; but all  Make the first circle beauteous, diversely  Partaking of sweet life, as more or less  Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them.  Here were they shown thee, not that fate assigns  This for their sphere, but for a sign to thee  Of that celestial furthest from the height.  Thus needs, that ye may apprehend, we speak:  Since from things sensible alone ye learn  That, which digested rightly after turns  To intellectual.  For no other cause  The scripture, condescending graciously  To your perception, hands and feet to God  Attributes, nor so means: and holy church  Doth represent with human countenance  Gabriel, and Michael, and him who made  Tobias whole.  Unlike what here thou seest,  The judgment of Timaeus, who affirms  Each soul restor'd to its particular star,  Believing it to have been taken thence,  When nature gave it to inform her mold:  Since to appearance his intention is  E'en what his words declare: or else to shun  Derision, haply thus he hath disguis'd  His true opinion.  If his meaning be,  That to the influencing of these orbs revert  The honour and the blame in human acts,  Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth.  This principle, not understood aright,  Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world;  So that it fell to fabled names of Jove,  And Mercury, and Mars.  That other doubt,  Which moves thee, is less harmful; for it brings  No peril of removing thee from me.    \"That, to the eye of man, our justice seems  Unjust, is argument for faith, and not  For heretic declension.  To the end  This truth may stand more clearly in your view,  I will content thee even to thy wish    \"If violence be, when that which suffers, nought  Consents to that which forceth, not for this  These spirits stood exculpate.  For the will,  That will not, still survives unquench'd, and doth  As nature doth in fire, tho' violence  Wrest it a thousand times; for, if it yield  Or more or less, so far it follows force.  And thus did these, whom they had power to seek  The hallow'd place again.  In them, had will  Been perfect, such as once upon the bars  Held Laurence firm, or wrought in Scaevola  To his own hand remorseless, to the path,  Whence they were drawn, their steps had hasten'd back,  When liberty return'd: but in too few  Resolve so steadfast dwells.  And by these words  If duly weigh'd, that argument is void,  Which oft might have perplex'd thee still.  But now  Another question thwarts thee, which to solve  Might try thy patience without better aid.  I have, no doubt, instill'd into thy mind,  That blessed spirit may not lie; since near  The source of primal truth it dwells for aye:  And thou might'st after of Piccarda learn  That Constance held affection to the veil;  So that she seems to contradict me here.  Not seldom, brother, it hath chanc'd for men  To do what they had gladly left undone,  Yet to shun peril they have done amiss:  E'en as Alcmaeon, at his father's suit  Slew his own mother, so made pitiless  Not to lose pity.  On this point bethink thee,  That force and will are blended in such wise  As not to make the' offence excusable.  Absolute will agrees not to the wrong,  That inasmuch as there is fear of woe  From non-compliance, it agrees.  Of will  Thus absolute Piccarda spake, and I  Of th' other; so that both have truly said.\"    Such was the flow of that pure rill, that well'd  From forth the fountain of all truth; and such  The rest, that to my wond'ring thoughts I found.    \"O thou of primal love the prime delight!  Goddess!\"  I straight reply'd, \"whose lively words  Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul!  Affection fails me to requite thy grace  With equal sum of gratitude: be his  To recompense, who sees and can reward thee.  Well I discern, that by that truth alone  Enlighten'd, beyond which no truth may roam,  Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know:  Therein she resteth, e'en as in his lair  The wild beast, soon as she hath reach'd that bound,  And she hath power to reach it; else desire  Were given to no end.  And thence doth doubt  Spring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;  And it is nature which from height to height  On to the summit prompts us.  This invites,  This doth assure me, lady, rev'rently  To ask thee of other truth, that yet  Is dark to me.  I fain would know, if man  By other works well done may so supply  The failure of his vows, that in your scale  They lack not weight.\"  I spake; and on me straight  Beatrice look'd with eyes that shot forth sparks  Of love celestial in such copious stream,  That, virtue sinking in me overpower'd,  I turn'd, and downward bent confus'd my sight.          CANTO V    \"If beyond earthly wont, the flame of love  Illume me, so that I o'ercome thy power  Of vision, marvel not: but learn the cause  In that perfection of the sight, which soon  As apprehending, hasteneth on to reach  The good it apprehends.  I well discern,  How in thine intellect already shines  The light eternal, which to view alone  Ne'er fails to kindle love; and if aught else  Your love seduces, 't is but that it shows  Some ill-mark'd vestige of that primal beam.    \"This would'st thou know, if failure of the vow  By other service may be so supplied,  As from self-question to assure the soul.\"    Thus she her words, not heedless of my wish,  Began; and thus, as one who breaks not off  Discourse, continued in her saintly strain.  \"Supreme of gifts, which God creating gave  Of his free bounty, sign most evident  Of goodness, and in his account most priz'd,  Was liberty of will, the boon wherewith  All intellectual creatures, and them sole  He hath endow'd.  Hence now thou mayst infer  Of what high worth the vow, which so is fram'd  That when man offers, God well-pleas'd accepts;  For in the compact between God and him,  This treasure, such as I describe it to thee,  He makes the victim, and of his own act.  What compensation therefore may he find?  If that, whereof thou hast oblation made,  By using well thou think'st to consecrate,  Thou would'st of theft do charitable deed.  Thus I resolve thee of the greater point.    \"But forasmuch as holy church, herein  Dispensing, seems to contradict the truth  I have discover'd to thee, yet behooves  Thou rest a little longer at the board,  Ere the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,  Digested fitly to nutrition turn.  Open thy mind to what I now unfold,  And give it inward keeping.  Knowledge comes  Of learning well retain'd, unfruitful else.    \"This sacrifice in essence of two things  Consisteth; one is that, whereof 't is made,  The covenant the other.  For the last,  It ne'er is cancell'd if not kept: and hence  I spake erewhile so strictly of its force.  For this it was enjoin'd the Israelites,  Though leave were giv'n them, as thou know'st, to change  The offering, still to offer.  Th' other part,  The matter and the substance of the vow,  May well be such, to that without offence  It may for other substance be exchang'd.  But at his own discretion none may shift  The burden on his shoulders, unreleas'd  By either key, the yellow and the white.  Nor deem of any change, as less than vain,  If the last bond be not within the new  Included, as the quatre in the six.  No satisfaction therefore can be paid  For what so precious in the balance weighs,  That all in counterpoise must kick the beam.  Take then no vow at random: ta'en, with faith  Preserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,  Blindly to execute a rash resolve,  Whom better it had suited to exclaim,  'I have done ill,' than to redeem his pledge  By doing worse or, not unlike to him  In folly, that great leader of the Greeks:  Whence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn'd  Her virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn  Both wise and simple, even all, who hear  Of so fell sacrifice.  Be ye more staid,  O Christians, not, like feather, by each wind  Removable: nor think to cleanse ourselves  In every water.  Either testament,  The old and new, is yours: and for your guide  The shepherd of the church let this suffice  To save you.  When by evil lust entic'd,  Remember ye be men, not senseless beasts;  Nor let the Jew, who dwelleth in your streets,  Hold you in mock'ry.  Be not, as the lamb,  That, fickle wanton, leaves its mother's milk,  To dally with itself in idle play.\"    Such were the words that Beatrice spake:  These ended, to that region, where the world  Is liveliest, full of fond desire she turn'd.    Though mainly prompt new question to propose,  Her silence and chang'd look did keep me dumb.  And as the arrow, ere the cord is still,  Leapeth unto its mark; so on we sped  Into the second realm.  There I beheld  The dame, so joyous enter, that the orb  Grew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star  Were mov'd to gladness, what then was my cheer,  Whom nature hath made apt for every change!    As in a quiet and clear lake the fish,  If aught approach them from without, do draw  Towards it, deeming it their food; so drew  Full more than thousand splendours towards us,  And in each one was heard: \"Lo! one arriv'd  To multiply our loves!\" and as each came  The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new,  Witness'd augmented joy.  Here, reader! think,  If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale,  To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave;  And thou shalt see what vehement desire  Possess'd me, as soon as these had met my view,  To know their state.  \"O born in happy hour!  Thou to whom grace vouchsafes, or ere thy close  Of fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones  Of that eternal triumph, know to us  The light communicated, which through heaven  Expatiates without bound.  Therefore, if aught  Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid,"]]]
