The abbot of St. Mary's, York, from possessing so much wealth, appears  to have met with Robin's especial animosity: his yearly revenues  amounted to L2,850. 1_s._ 5_d_. Robin was, however, a man of exemplary  piety, according to the notions of that age, and retained a domestic  chaplain, (friar Tuck,) no doubt, for the diurnal celebration of the  divine mysteries. This we learn from an anecdote preserved by Fordun,  \"One day, as he heard mass, he was espied by a certain sheriff and  officers belonging to the king, who had frequently before molested him.  His people perceiving what was going forward, advised him to fly with  all speed, but out of reverence of the Sacrament in which he was then  engaged, he refused to do so. Most of his men fled, fearing death, but  Robin confiding in him whom he worshipped, with the few that remained,  set upon his enemies, and soon vanquished them, enriching himself with  the spoils and ransom.\" Robin held masses in greater veneration ever  after, stating, that Providence deserved still more from him, having  delivered him thus miraculously. At length, the infirmities of age  increasing, and having a great sickness upon him, Robin was desirous to  lose a little blood, and for that purpose he applied to the prioress of  Kirkleys Nunnery, in Yorkshire; who, though a relation, treacherously  suffered him to bleed to death, in, it is said, his 87th year. According  to Grafton's Chronicle, it is said that after his death, the prioress  caused him to be buried under a great stone \"by the hywayes syde, and  upon his grave the sayde prioress did lay a very fayre stone, wherein  the names of Robert Hood, William of Goldesborough, and others were  graven. And the cause why she buryed him there was for that the common  passengers and travailers, knowyng and seeyng him there buryed, might  more safely and without feare take their jorneys that way, which they  durst not do in the life of the sayed outlawes; and at eyther ende of  the sayde tombe was erected a crosse of stone.\"    Amongst the papers of the learned Dr. Gale, late Dean of York, was found  this epitaph of Robin Hood, written in old English:        Hear underneath this laitl stean,    Laiz Robert, Earl of Huntingtun,    Near arcir ther az hie sa goud    An pipl kauld im Robin Heud,    Sick utlawz az hi an iz men    Wil England nivr si agen.      Obiit 24--kal dekembris, 1247.      There is an odd story related of this tombstone: that a certain knight  taking it into his head to have it removed and placed as a hearth-stone  in his great hall, it was laid over night, but the next morning it was  surprisingly removed on one side; it was again laid a second and third  time, and as often turned aside. The knight thinking he had done wrong  by removing it, ordered it should be drawn back again, which was  performed by a pair of oxen and four horses, when twice the number could  scarce remove it before.

In the year ----, as Wull, or William Hall, then overseer of the farm  of Sunderland, in Selkirkshire, Scotland, the labours of the day being  over, was leaning against the dyke of the farm-yard, a young gentleman  of genteel appearance came up to him, wished him good evening, and  observed that the country here looked beautiful. The two getting into  conversation, Hall, who was a talkative lad, after a few observations,  asked him \"where he was ga'in?\" He said he intended going to Jedburgh;  \"and what business hae ye at Jeddart?\" says Wull. \"Oh,\" says the  gentleman, \"I am going to attend the circuit court; but my feet have  failed me on the road.\" And observing a pony in the farm-yard, he said,  \"That's a bit nice pony of yours;--is it to sell?--would you like to  part with it?\" \"A wad' na' care,\" Wull says; \"but ma brother Geordy,  he's the farmer; and he's at Selkirk the day. But if we could get a guid  price for't, a daresay we might part wi't.\" \"What do you ask for it?\"  says the stranger. \"Ma brother,\" quoth Wull. \"says it's a thing we hae  nae use for, and if we could get ought of a wiselike price for't, it  would be as well to let it gang.\" There were only two words to the  bargain; the gentleman and Wull agreed. Says the gentleman, \"By the way,  I cannot pay you to-night; but if you have any hesitation about me, my  name is Henry Brougham, and I refer you to the Earl of Buchan, or Mr.  George Currie, of Greenhead, who will satisfy you.\" It will be observed  that the places of residence of this nobleman, and Henry's brother  advocate, Mr. Currie, were in the neighbourhood. On this reference,  without making any inquiry, honest, Wull immediately gave the gentleman  the pony, with the necessary trappings. Wull being a man of orderly  habits, went early to bed; and next morning, when the business of the  farm called him and Geordy together, says Wull to Geordy, \"Ye was unco  late in coming hame last night; aw salt the powny.\" \"And wha did you  sell it to?\" \"Oh, to a young gentleman.\" \"And what did you get for't?\"  Wull having mentioned the price--\"My faith,\" says Geordy, \"ye hae selt  it weel.\" \"But,\" says Wull, \"a did na' get the siller.\" \"You d--d idiot,  ye did na' gie away the powny without getting the siller for't; wha was  he?\" \"Oh, he ca'd himsel' Henry Brougham, and he said if a had ony  jealousin' about him, that the Earl of Buchan, or George Currie,  advocate, Greenhead, would say he was guid enough for the money. On, he  was an honest-looking lad; a could hae trusted ony thing in his hand.\"  Geordy's temper became quite ungovernable at Wull's simplicity. After  the whole southern circuit was finished, there was no word of payment,  and Wull's life became quite miserable at Geordy's incessant grumbling  and taunting; the latter ever and anon repeating, \"What a d--d idiot  Wull was to gie the beest without the money till a man he kend naething  about;\" and the other as pertinaciously insisting, \"that he (the  gentleman) was an honest-looking man, there was nae fear o' him.\" In the  course of six weeks an order came for the payment of the steed. \"L--d,\"  says Wull, \"did na I tell ye he was an honest man, a kend by the look o'  him.\" From that moment Wull stood eminently high in Geordy's eyes; and  while the one chuckled at his penetration of character, the other was no  less humbled at having called his superior judgment in question. William  Hall is still alive, and there is not a prouder man in Britain's Isle  than he is when he relates the little incident in his life, of which the  present Lord Chancellor of Great Britain forms the  hero.--_Schoolmaster._           *       *       *       *       *      O'BRIEN, THE IRISH GIANT.      This extraordinary giant, whose height was nearly nine feet, was born at  Kinsale, in the kingdom of Ireland. His real name was Patrick Cotter; he  was of obscure parentage, and originally laboured as a brick-layer; but  his uncommon size rendered him a mark for the avarice of a showman, who,  for the payment of L50. per annum, obtained the liberty of exhibiting  him for three years in England. Not contented with his bargain, the  chapman attempted to _underlet_ to another speculator, the liberty of  showing him, and poor Cotter resisting this nefarious transaction, was  saddled with a fictitious debt, and thrown into a spunging house in  Bristol. In this situation he was, happily for him, visited in prison by  a gentleman of the city, who, in compassion to his distress, and having  reason to think that he was unjustly detained, very generously became  his bail, and ultimately so far investigated the affair, that he not  only obtained him his liberty, but freed him from all kind of obligation  to serve his task-master any longer. He was at this time eighteen years  old. He subsequently retained, to his last breath, a most lively sense  of the obligation conferred upon him when a stranger, and in need; which  he manifested also by very _honourable mention_ in his will. It happened  to be September when he was liberated, and, by the further assistance of  his benefactor, he was enabled to set up for himself in the fair then  held in St. James's. Success crowned his undertaking, and in three days,  instead of being in penury, he saw himself possessed of thirty pounds,  English money. Let those who know the peasantry of Ireland, judge of his  riches! He now commenced a regular exhibition of his person, which he  continued until the last two years of his life, when, having realized a  sufficient fortune to keep a carriage and live in good style, he  declined what was always exceedingly irksome to his feelings. He was  unoffending and amiable in his manners, to his friends and acquaintance,  of whom he had latterly a large circle; and he was neither averse to a  cheerful glass nor pleasant company. He had naturally good sense, and  his mind was not uncultivated. Mr. Cotter had at one time in his  possession, a regular journal of his life, written from day to day, for  amusement, but which a whim of the moment induced him to commit to the  flames, though he afterwards much regretted the circumstance. He died in  his 46th year, September 8, 1806, at the Hotwells, Bristol. In his last  moments he was attended by Mr. Plowden, and departed without the  smallest apparent pain or agony. He was buried in the Romish chapel,  Trenchard-street, at the early hour of six, to prevent as much as  possible, a crowd; notwithstanding which, the street was so thronged,  that the assistance of the constables, was necessary to keep the door of  the chapel, and resist the importunity of the public to behold the  interment. It is supposed 2,000 persons at least were present.

McDaniel, Brinkley, Arkansas  Age: 73      \"I was born in Newton County, Mississippi the first year of the  surrender. I don't think my mother was sold and I know my father was  never sold. Jim McDaniel raised my father and one sister after his  mother died. One sister was married when she died. I heard him say when  he got mad he would quit work. He said old master wouldn't let the  mistress whoop him and she wouldn't let him whoop my father. My father  was a black man but my mother was light. Her father was a white man and  her mother part Indian and white mixed, so what am I? My mother was  owned by people named Wash. Dick Wash was her young master. My parents'  names was Willis and Elsie McDaniel. When it was freedom I heard them  say Moster McDaniel told them they was free. He was broke. If they could  do better go on, he didn't blame them, he couldn't promise them much  now. They moved off on another man's place to share crop. They had to  work as hard and didn't have no more than they had in slavery. That is  what they told me. They could move around and visit around without  asking. They said it didn't lighten the work none but it lightened the  rations right smart. Moster McDaniel nor my father neither one went to  war.    \"From the way I always heard it, the Ku Klux was the law like night  watchman. When I was a boy there was a lot of stealing and bushwhacking.  Folks meet you out and kill you, rob you, whoop you. A few of the black  men wouldn't work and wanted to steal. That Ku Klux was the law watching  around. Folks was scared of em. I did see them. I would run hide.    \"I farmed up till 1929. Then I been doing jobs. I worked on relief till  they turned me off, said I was too old to work but they won't give me  the pension. I been trying to figure out what I am to do. Lady, could  you tell me?

What all don't they do?\"          Interviewer: Samuel S. Taylor  Person interviewed: Waters McIntosh                      1900 Howard Street, Little Rock, Arkansas  Age: 76      \"I was born July 4, 1862 at 2:08 in the morning at Lynchburg, Sumter  County, South Carolina.      Parents    \"My mother was named Lucy Sanders. My father was named Sumter Durant.  Our owner was Dr. J.M. Sanders, the son of Mr. Bartlett Sanders. Sumter  Durant was a white man. My mother was fourteen years old when I was born  I was her second child. Durant was in the Confederate army and was  killed during the War in the same year I was born, and before my birth.      Sold    \"When I was a year old, my mother was sold for $1500 in gold, and I was  sold for $500 in gold to William Carter who lived about five miles south  of Cartersville. The payment was made in fine gold. I was sold because  my folk realized that freedom was coming and they wanted to obtain the  cash value of their slaves.      Name    \"My name is spelled 'Waters' but it is pronounced 'Waiters.' When I was  born, I was thought to be a very likely child and it was proposed that I  should be a waiter. Therefore I was called Waters (but it was pronounced  Waiters). They did not spell it w-a-i-t-e-r-s, but they pronounced it  that way.      How Freedom Came    \"My mother said that they had been waiting a long time to hear what had  become of the War, perhaps one or two weeks. One day when they were in  the field moulding corn, going round the corn hoeing it and putting a  little hill around it, the conk sounded at about eleven o'clock, and  they knew that the long expected time had come. They dropped their hoes  and went to the big house. They went around to the back where the master  always met the servants and he said to them, 'You are all free, free as  I am. You can go or come as you please. I want you to stay. If you will  stay, I will give you half the crop.' That was the beginning of the  share cropping system.    \"My mother came at once to the quarters, and when she found me she  pulled the end out of a corn sack, stuck holes on the sides, put a cord  through the top, pulled out the end, put it on me, put on the only dress  she had, and made it back to the old home (her first master's folk).      What the Slaves Expected    \"When the slaves were freed, they got what they expected. They were glad  to get it and get away with it, and that was what mother and them did.      Slave Time Preaching    \"One time when an old white man come along who wanted to preach, the  white people gave him a chance to preach to the niggers. The substance  of his sermon was this:    \"'Now when you servants are working for your masters, you must be  honest. When you go to the mill, don't carry along an extra sack and put  some of the meal or the flour in for yourself. And when you women are  cooking in the big house, don't make a big pocket under your dress and  put a sack of coffee and a sack of sugar and other things you want in  it.\"    \"They took him out and hanged him for corrupting the morals of the  slaves.      Conditions After the War    \"Immediately after the War, there was a great scarcity of food. Neither  Negroes nor white folk had anything to eat. The few white people who did  have something wouldn't let it be known. My grandmother who was  sixty-five years old and one of the old and respected inhabitants of  that time went out to find something for us to eat. A white woman named  Mrs. Burton gave her a sack of meal and told her not to tell anybody  where she got it.    \"My grandmother brought the meal home and cooked it in a large skillet  in a big cake. When it got done, she cut it into slices in the way you  would cut up a pie and divided it among us. That all we had to eat.      House    \"The white people in those days built their houses back from the front.  In South Carolina, there were lots of farms that had four to twelve  thousand acres. From what mother told me, Master Bill's place set back  from the road. Then there was a great square place they called the yard.  A fence divided the house and the yard adjoining it from that part of  the grounds which held the barn. The yard in front and back of the house  held a grove.    [Illustration]    The square around the house and the Negro quarters were all enclosed so  that the little slaves could not get out while parents were at work. The  Negroes assembled on the porch when the gong called them in the morning.  The boss gave orders from the porch. There was an open space between the  quarters and the court (where the little slaves played). There was a  gate between the court and the big house.    \"On the rear of the house, there was a porch from which the boss gave  orders usually about four o'clock in the morning and at which they would  disband in the evening between nine and ten--no certain time but more or  less not earlier than nine and not often later than ten. Back of the  house and beyond it was a fence extending clear across the yard. In one  corner of this fence was a gate leading into the court. Leading out of  the court was an opening surrounded by a semi-circular fence which  enclosed the Negro quarters.    \"The cabins were usually built on the ground--no floors. The roofs were  covered with clapboards.    \"When I was a boy we used to sing, 'Rather be a nigger than a poor white  man.' Even in slavery they used to sing that. It was the poor white man  who was freed by the War, not the Negroes.      Furniture    \"There wasn't any furniture. Beds were built with one post out and the  other three _sides_ fastened to the sides of the house.      Marrying Time    \"I remember one night the people were gone to marry. That was when all  the people in the community married immediately after slavery.      Ghosts    \"We had an open fireplace. That was at Bartlett Sanders' place. He had  close on to three thousand acres. Every grown person had gone to the  marrying, and I was at home in the bed I just described.    \"My grandfather's mother[HW: ?] had a chair and that was hers only. She  was named Senia and was about eighty years old. We burned nothing but  pine knots in the hearth. You would put one or two of those on the fire  and they would burn for hours. We were all in bed and had been for an  hour or two. There were some others sleeping in the same room. There  came a peculiar knocking on grandmother's[HW: great grandmother?] chair.  It's hard to describe it. It was something like the distant beating of a  drum. Grandmother was dead, of course. The boys got up and ran out and  brought in some of the hands. When they came in, a little thing about  three and a half feet high with legs about six or eight inches long ran  out of the room.      Ku Klux Klan    \"Whenever there was a man of influence, they terrorized him. They were  at their height about the time of Grant's election. Many a time my  mother and I have watched them pass our door. They wore gowns and some  kind of helmet. They would be going to catch same leading Negro and whip  him. There was scarcely a night they couldn't take a leading Negro out  and whip him if they would catch him alone.
