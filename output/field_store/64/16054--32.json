It is for this  reason that canned fruit does not require so much time for sterilization  as vegetables do. Still it should not be inferred that care is not  necessary in the canning of fruits. Indeed, the more care that is taken,  the better are the results likely to be.    78. SIRUPS FOR CANNING.--Before the canning of fruits can be undertaken,  it is necessary to possess a knowledge of the sirups that are needed.  Such sirups consist simply of sugar dissolved in boiling water. The  quantity of sugar and water required for a sirup depends on the acidity  of the fruit and the purpose for which it is to be used. Plain canned  fruits that are to be used for sauces, etc. require less sugar  proportionately than those which are preserved, and fruit canned for pie  making may have less than either. Thus, fruits of the same kind may be  canned with sirups of different proportions. To a great extent, the  quantity of sugar to use with fruit may be regulated by the taste, but  it will be readily seen that such fruits as sour cherries and plums will  require more sugar to make them palatable than pears and blueberries. It  will be well to note, though, that the sugar does not penetrate the  fruit unless the two are cooked together.    79. In order to make sirup for canning, place the desired quantities of  sugar and water in a kettle and proceed to heat them. Stir the liquid  while it is heating, in order to assist in dissolving the sugar. When it  has begun to boil rapidly, remove the sirup from the fire and use it at  once. Do not continue boiling.    In preparing such sirups, it will be well to note that the greater the  proportion of sugar to water or the longer the sugar and water are  allowed to boil, the denser, or heavier, will the sirup become. It is  this _density_ of sirup that regulates its use for the different kinds  of fruit and determines its nature. Thus, a sirup in which the  proportion of sugar to water is so large as to make the sirup thick is  known as a _heavy sirup_; one in which the proportion of water to sugar  is so large as to make the sirup thin is called a _light sirup_; and one  in which the proportion of sugar and water is such as to produce a sirup  that is neither thick nor thin, but stands between the two extremes, is  called a _medium sirup_.

The density of sirup is also affected by the amount and rapidity of  evaporation that takes place in boiling, and these, in turn, depend on  the amount of surface that is exposed. For instance, if a sirup is  cooked in a large, flat kettle, the evaporation will be greater and more  rapid than if it is cooked in a small, deep vessel. Atmospheric pressure  affects the rapidity of evaporation, too. In a high altitude,  evaporation takes place more slowly than at sea level, because the  boiling point is lower. Thus, in the making of sirups for canning, the  first point to be determined is whether the sirup desired should be  light, medium, or heavy, and in its preparation the points mentioned  must receive consideration.    81. For determining the density of sirup, a _sirup gauge_, or  _hydrometer_, will be found useful. This device consists of a graduated  glass tube attached to a bulb that is weighted with mercury. The  graduations, or marks, on the tube, or top part, of the hydrometer serve  to indicate the percentage of solid matter dissolved in a solution and  register from to 50 degrees. To use such a gauge, partly fill a glass  cylinder--an ordinary drinking glass will do--with the sirup and place  the hydrometer in it. The greater the amount of solid matter dissolved  in the sirup, the higher will be hydrometer float. Then read the number  of degrees registered by observing the mark that is level with the  surface of the sirup.    The number of degrees that the hydrometer should register for sirups of  different densities--that is, for sirups consisting of different  proportions of sugar and water--are given in Table I. This table, in  addition, gives the uses that should be made of such sirups, and each  one is numbered so that it may be referred to readily later in the  recipes for canning fruits.    82. CLASSIFICATION OF FRUITS.--For the sake of convenience in canning,  fruits, too, are here divided into groups. These groups, three in  number, together with the fruits included in each, are:    1. _Soft Fruits_, which are subdivided into three kinds, namely, sweet,  sour, and very sour. The _sweet soft fruits_ include blackberries,  blueberries or huckleberries, sweet cherries, elderberries, ripe  gooseberries, mulberries, and black and red raspberries; the _sour soft  fruits_, apricots, currants, grapes, peaches, and strawberries; and the  _very sour soft fruits_, sour cherries, cranberries, green gooseberries,  plums, and rhubarb.    2. _Hard Fruits_, which include apples, quinces, and pears.    3. _Special Fruits_, which include ripe figs, kumquats, loquats,  nectarines, persimmons, and pineapples.    The advantage of this classification, as in the case of the vegetable  classification, is that, as a rule, all fruits belonging to a group or a  subdivision of a group may be canned in the same way and with sirup of  practically the same density.    83. CANNING METHODS FOR FRUITS.--The canning of fruits may be done by  the several methods previously discussed, but the Cold-pack and  open-kettle methods seem to meet with most favor. On account of the  sirup used in canning fruit and the acid in the fruit, the open-kettle  method is usually fairly successful, whereas, in the canning of  vegetables, with the exception of tomatoes, it is not so reliable. The  housewife, by experiment, can determine which method will suit her needs  best, but by no means should methods be mixed. If a certain method is  decided on, it should be adhered to in every detail and carried through  without any substitution. For all methods, as has been mentioned, the  fruit should be selected when it is fresh and in good condition, as such  fruit has less chance to spoil than fruit that is overripe or has  decayed spots. After it is graded for size and condition, the fruit  should be washed, stemmed, hulled, seeded, peeled, or halved, quartered,  or sliced, depending on the kind. Then the work may be proceeded with  according to the canning method that is to be followed.    84. If fruits are to be canned by the open-kettle method, certain  precautions must be observed in order to insure success. The  sterilization of the product cannot be perfect in this method no matter  how carefully the canning is done; and this means that the sugar and the  fruit acids must be greatly relied on to assist in preservation. Still,  the jars, jar covers, jar rubbers, and any utensils used for filling the  jars must be sterilized and kept in boiling water until the fruit is  ready to be canned. Another thing to guard against is the discoloring of  the fruit. Any fruit that is likely to become discolored after it is  prepared for canning should be kept in salt water until it is ready to  be cooked. A solution consisting of 1 teaspoonful of salt to each quart  of water will answer for this purpose.    After the fruit has been prepared and while the containers, etc. are  being sterilized, it is necessary to prepare the sirup that is to be  used. For the sweet fruits of Group 1, No. 1 or 2 sirup should be made;  for the sour fruits of this group, No. 2 or 3 sirup; and for the very  sour fruits, No. 4 or 5 sirup. The hard fruits may be canned by this  method with No. 1, 2, or 3 sirup, while the special fruits require No. 4  or 5 sirup. If the fruit is to be canned for pie, it will be advisable  to use thin sirup and then use more sweetening when pies are made.    When the sirup is made by mixing the sugar and water and bringing it to  a boil, the prepared fruit should be dropped into it and cooked. The  fruit should be cooked in the sirup until it may be easily pierced with  a fork or until it is soft. Berries have to be cooked only a few  minutes, while the hard fruits may require from 10 to 15 minutes. The  jars should be placed upright in a pan of hot water while the boiling  fruit from the kettle is poured into them, and as each jar is filled the  rubber should be put in place and the cover adjusted and secured. It is  important to close one jar before filling another, because the longer a  jar remains open the more bacteria will be permitted to enter. Even by  working as rapidly as possible and taking the greatest precaution, a  certain number of bacteria are bound to enter in this method of canning.  After the jars are filled and sealed, they should be placed upside down  or on the side to cool and test for leaks.    85.

The CAPPARIS LASIANTHA was observed  amongst the climbing shrubs still in fruit; and a beautiful new LORANTH,  with red flowers tipped with green, was parasitical on trees.[**] On the  bank of the Narran we found the AMARANTHUS UNDULATUS of Brown.

Lat. 29 deg. 6' 33\"  S.; therm. at sunrise, 48 deg.; at 4 P. M., 101 deg.; at 9, 74 deg.; ditto with wet  bulb, 62 deg..    25TH MARCH.--The cattle had now to return to bring forward the drays.  Meanwhile I took a ride up the river, in order to ensure a moderate  journey for these exhausted animals. Proceeding along the right bank, I  found gravelly slopes almost closing upon the river. The direction of its  course for four miles, was nearly southward. Then I saw gravelly ridges  on the left, and a line of wood before me, while the river evidently came  from the East round the margin of an extensive plain. I continued  northward; found a rosewood scrub: then saw the Malga tree; passed  through scrubs thereof; found myself on stony ridges, whence descending  in a N. E. direction, again passed through rosewood scrubs, and only  reached the river after riding 21/2 miles in that direction. I saw a  continuous ridge, bare and distant, beyond what I considered the river  bed, and a similar ridge to the westward. I crossed a native camp where  the newly deserted fires still smoked. We saw one man at a distance, who  did not mind us much; I could not have obtained any information from him,  and therefore did not seek a parley. Crossing the Narran there, by a  beaten track, beside a native fishing fence, I returned to the camp, on  the bearing of S. S. W., and found a grassy plain the whole way back,  until within sight of the tents, and a good rocky ford for the passage of  the party next day. On the stony ridge I found a remarkable shrub, a  species of Sida (ABUTILON), allied to S. GRAVEOLENS, Roxb., but distinct.  The teams brought the drays in, about 5 P. M.; one animal of all being  missing. Therm. at sunrise, 72 deg.; at noon, 89 deg.; at 4 P. M., 91 deg.; at 9,  60 deg.;--with wet bulb, 53 deg..    26TH MARCH.--Early this morning, William Baldock was sent back in search  of the stray bullock, while the party crossed the Narran, and proceeded  along my horse's track of yesterday. Baldock over took the party, having  found the bullock on the river, four miles below our late encampment. The  natives seen yesterday had disappeared, having previously set fire to the  grass. We proceeded two miles beyond their fires, and encamped on the  river bank in lat. 29 deg. 1' 57\" S.    A small path along the river margin; marks on trees, where hollow  portions of bark had been taken off; some ancient, some recent, huts of  withered boughs and dry grass; freshwater muscle shells, beside the ashes  of small fires; and, in some places, a small heap of pulled grass  (PANICUM LOEVINODE), or of the coral plant; such were the slight but  constant indications of the existence of man on the Narran. Such was the  only home of our fellow-beings in these parts, and from it they retired  on our approach. Ducks, which were rather numerous, and emus (coming to  drink), probably constituted their chief food, as nets to ensnare both  these kinds of birds, were found about their huts. Youranigh brought me  one of their chisels, a small bit of iron fastened to a stick with gum,  and tied with a piece of striped shirting. I directed him to place it  carefully where he had found it. Thermometer at sunrise, 47 deg.; at noon,  90 deg.; at 4 P. M., 95 deg.; at 9, 69 deg.;--with wet bulb, 60 deg.. The mean height  above the sea of the camps of 23d, 24th, and 26th March, was 461 feet.    27TH MARCH.--Pursuing, as well as we could, the course of the Narran,  which came more from the northward, we again encamped on its banks after  a journey of seven miles, without recognising any indication of the  vicinity of the larger stream, which, according to our latitude, we ought  by this to have reached. The current here had evidently been more  decided, and dry trunks and other FLUVIATILE DEBRIS lay more in masses  against whatever had lain in the water's way. Excellent grass clothed the  plains over which we had passed during the two last days, and grew  abundantly also about the banks of the river; but, in general, a belt of  the POLYGONUM JUNCEUM, about 400 or 500 yards wide, grew between the  immediate margin and the grassy plains. This shrub was found an  infallible guide to the vicinity of the river, when, as sometimes  happened, other lines of trees, resembling those on its banks, had led me  to a distance from it. The day was cool and rather cloudy, a great  novelty to us; for every day had been clear and unclouded, since long  before we crossed the Barwan. Abundance of the stones of the quandang  fruit (FUSANUS ACUMINATUS) lay at an old fire of the natives, and showed  that we were not far from the northern limit of the great clay basin, as  the quandang bush grows only upon the lowest slopes of hilly land. Lat.  28 deg. 55' 13\" S. Thermometer at sunrise, 70 deg.; at noon, 90 deg.; at 4 P. M., 89;  at 9, 70 deg.;--with wet bulb, 61 deg..    28TH MARCH.--At 2 A. M., loud thunder was heard in the south-west, where  a dark cloud arose and passed round to the northward; a few drops of rain  fell. The morning was otherwise clear, with a cooling breeze from S. W.  Thermometer at sunrise, 56 deg.. We proceeded, travelling chiefly amongst  very luxuriant grass. The river now disappeared as far to the westward of  my northerly course on this left bank, as it had left me when on the  other bank by unexpected turns to the eastward. I came upon its banks  after travelling about eight miles. At the spot where I wished to place  the camp I perceived a native, and with Youranigh's assistance, managed  to prevent him from running away. He spoke only \"Jerwoolleroy,\" a dialect  which my native did not understand at all well. He told us, however, that  this was still the Narran, and pointed N. W. to the Balonne. Upon the  whole we gathered from him that neither that river nor the Bokhara was  far from us. I endeavoured to convince him, by Youranigh's assurances,  and our own civility to him, that we meant no harm to any natives, and  were only passing through the country. He did not seem afraid, although  he had never, until then, seen white men. We encamped near him. The river  channel was very narrow, and contained but little water here-abouts. I  understood from the native (through Youranigh) that the river here spread  into various channels, and that \"BARRO\" was the name of a river beyond  the Culg, which falls into it from the northward; \"TOORINGORRA,\" the  lagoon on which we encamped after meeting natives on the 31st March. Near  this camp we found a PHYLLANTHUS, scarcely different from P. SIMPLEX; a  SESBANIA near S. ACULEATA, but with smaller flowers; and the CHENOPODIUM  AURICOMUM, formed a white-leaved shrub, three or four feet high.  Thermometer at sunrise, 56 deg.; at noon, 78 deg.; at 4 P. M., 82 deg.; at 9, 61 deg.;--  with wet bulb, 56 deg..    29TH MARCH.--After prayers (the day being Sunday) I sent Mr. Kennedy  forward to explore the course of the river, in order to ensure a more  direct line for to-morrow's route. Mr. Kennedy was accompanied by one of  the men armed, and also by Youranigh, all being mounted. He returned in  about four hours, having found the river coming from the northward, and  he also reported favourably of the ground. Thermometer at sunrise, 48 deg.;  at 4 P. M., 81 deg.; at 9, 51 deg.;--with wet bulb, 47 deg..    30TH MARCH.--The night had been cool and pleasant, Thermometer at sunrise  only 42 deg.. The cattle were yoked up early, and we travelled on over fine  grassy plains, and with open gravelly ridges on our right. At length,  about the sixth mile, these ridges closed on the river, where there was  one hill almost clear of trees or bushes. I ascended it, but could only  see plains to the westward, and a dense line of river-trees running  north. We at length encamped on what appeared to be still the Narran,  after a journey of about eight miles.    We this day passed a small group of trees of the yellow gum, a species of  eucalyptus growing only on the poor sandy soil near Botany Bay, and other  parts of the sea-coast near Sydney. Thermometer at sunrise, 42 deg.; at 4 P.  M., 83 deg.; at 9, 61 deg.;--with wet bulb, 57 deg.. Mean height of the camps of the  27th, 28th, and 30th, above the level of the sea, 509 feet.    31ST MARCH.--The various lines of trees were now so much dispersed across  the country, that to follow the line of the Narran, it was necessary to  see its ponds and channel as frequently as possible. The course, if not  of the river, at least of its ana-branches; and there were besides those,  branches of another kind, namely, true branches coming from the main  channel, as branches leave the stem of a tree, never to unite with it  again. Some of those of this description, so closely resembled in every  respect the Narran, that the difference was only to be distinguished by  observing the marks of flood on trees, and ascertaining the direction of  the current. We had crossed several such, and were rather in a \"fix\" with  some lagoons, when I perceived several native children in one of them. I  wished here to intercept some natives who might tell us where was the  ford of \"Congo,\" where white men had crossed the Balonne,"]]]
