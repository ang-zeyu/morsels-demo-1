[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#3)"],[1,"   \"What? Yes. Oh, yes. Quite so. And perhaps you would like a cup of tea  after your journey? No? Quite so. Quite so. You should make a point of  visiting the remains of the Cluniac Priory in the summer holidays,  Jackson. You will find the matron in her room. In many respects it is  unique. The northern altar is in a state of really wonderful  preservation. It consists of a solid block of masonry five feet long and  two and a half wide, with chamfered plinth, standing quite free from the  apse wall. It will well repay a visit. Good-bye for the present,  Jackson, good-bye.\"    Mike wandered across to the other side of the house, his gloom visibly  deepened. All alone in a strange school, where they probably played  hopscotch, with a housemaster who offered one cups of tea after one's  journey and talked about chamfered plinths and apses. It was a  little hard.    He strayed about, finding his bearings, and finally came to a room which  he took to be the equivalent of the senior day room at a Wrykyn house.  Everywhere else he had found nothing but emptiness. Evidently he had  come by an earlier train than was usual. But this room was occupied.    A very long, thin youth, with a solemn face and immaculate clothes, was  leaning against the mantelpiece. As Mike entered, he fumbled in his top  left waistcoat pocket, produced an eyeglass attached to a cord, and  fixed it in his right eye. With the help of this aid to vision he  inspected Mike in silence for a while, then, having flicked an invisible  speck of dust from the left sleeve of his coat, he spoke.    \"Hello,\" he said.    He spoke in a tired voice.    \"Hello,\" said Mike.    \"Take a seat,\" said the immaculate one. \"If you don't mind dirtying your  bags, that's to say. Personally, I don't see any prospect of ever  sitting down in this place. It looks to me as if they meant to use these  chairs as mustard-and-cress beds. A Nursery Garden in the Home. That  sort of idea. My name,\" he added pensively, \"is Smith. What's yours?\"        3    PSMITH      \"Jackson,\" said Mike.    \"Are you the Bully, the Pride of the School, or the Boy who is Led  Astray and takes to Drink in Chapter Sixteen?\"    \"The last, for choice,\" said Mike, \"but I've only just arrived, so I  don't know.\"    \"The boy--what will he become? Are you new here, too, then?\"    \"Yes! Why, are you new?\"    \"Do I look as if I belonged here? I'm the latest import. Sit down on  yonder settee, and I will tell you the painful story of my life. By the  way, before I start, there's just one thing. If you ever have occasion  to write to me, would you mind sticking a P at the beginning of my name?  P-s-m-i-t-h. See? There are too many Smiths, and I don't care for  Smythe. My father's content to worry along in the old-fashioned way, but  I've decided to strike out a fresh line. I shall found a new dynasty.  The resolve came to me unexpectedly this morning. I jotted it down on  the back of an envelope. In conversation you may address me as Rupert  (though I hope you won't), or simply Smith, the _P_ not being sounded.  Compare the name Zbysco, in which the Z is given a similar  miss-in-balk. See?\"    Mike said he saw. Psmith thanked him with a certain stately old world  courtesy.    \"Let us start at the beginning,\" he resumed. \"My infancy. When I was but  a babe, my eldest sister was bribed with a shilling an hour by my nurse  to keep an eye on me, and see that I did not raise Cain. At the end of  the first day she struck for one-and-six, and got it. We now pass to my  boyhood. At an early age, I was sent to Eton, everybody predicting a  bright career for me. But,\" said Psmith solemnly, fixing an owl-like  gaze on Mike through the eyeglass, \"it was not to be.\"    \"No?\" said Mike.    \"No. I was superannuated last term.\"    \"Bad luck.\"    \"For Eton, yes. But what Eton loses, Sedleigh gains.\"    \"But why Sedleigh, of all places?\"    \"This is the most painful part of my narrative. It seems that a certain  scug in the next village to ours happened last year to collar a  Balliol--\"    \"Not Barlitt!\" exclaimed Mike.    \"That was the man. The son of the vicar. The vicar told the curate, who  told our curate, who told our vicar, who told my father, who sent me off  here to get a Balliol too. Do _you_ know Barlitt?\"    \"His father's vicar of our village. It was because his son got a Balliol  that I was sent here.\"    \"Do you come from Crofton?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I've lived at Lower Benford all my life. We are practically long-lost  brothers. Cheer a little, will you?\"    Mike felt as Robinson Crusoe felt when he met Friday. Here was a fellow  human being in this desert place. He could almost have embraced Psmith.  The very sound of the name Lower Benford was heartening. His dislike for  his new school was not diminished, but now he felt that life there might  at least be tolerable.    \"Where were you before you came here?\" asked Psmith. \"You have heard my  painful story. Now tell me yours.\"    \"Wrykyn. My father took me away because I got such a lot of bad  reports.\"    \"My reports from Eton were simply scurrilous. There's a libel action in  every sentence. How do you like this place, from what you've seen  of it?\"    \"Rotten.\"    \"I am with you, Comrade Jackson. You won't mind my calling you Comrade,  will you? I've just become a socialist. It's a great scheme. You ought  to be one. You work for the equal distribution of property, and start by  collaring all you can and sitting on it. We must stick together. We are  companions in misfortune. Lost lambs. Sheep that have gone astray.  Divided, we fall, together we may worry through. Have you seen Professor  Radium yet? I should say Mr. Outwood. What do you think of him?\"    \"He doesn't seem a bad sort of chap. Bit off his nut. Jawed about apses  and things.\"    \"And thereby,\" said Psmith, \"hangs a tale. I've been making inquiries of  a stout sportsman in a sort of Salvation Army uniform, whom I met in the  grounds--he's the school sergeant or something, quite a solid man--and I  hear that Comrade Outwood's an archaeological cove. Goes about the  country beating up old ruins and fossils and things. There's an  Archaeological Society in the school, run by him. It goes out on  half-holidays, prowling about, and is allowed to break bounds and  generally steep itself to the eyebrows in reckless devilry. And, mark  you, laddie, if you belong to the Archaeological Society you get off  cricket. To get off cricket,\" said Psmith, dusting his right trouser  leg, \"was the dream of my youth and the aspiration of my riper years. A  noble game, but a bit too thick for me. At Eton I used to have to field  out at the nets till the soles of my boots wore through. I suppose you  are a blood at the game? Play for the school against Loamshire, and  so on.\"    \"I'm not going to play here, at any rate,\" said Mike.    He had made up his mind on this point in the train. There is a certain  fascination about making the very worst of a bad job. Achilles knew his  business when he sat in his tent. The determination not to play cricket  for Sedleigh as he could not play for Wrykyn gave Mike a sort of  pleasure. To stand by with folded arms and a somber frown, as it were,  was one way of treating the situation, and one not without its meed  of comfort.    Psmith approved the resolve.    \"Stout fellow,\" he said. \"'Tis well. You and I, hand in hand, will  search the countryside for ruined abbeys. We will snare the elusive  fossil together. Above all, we will go out of bounds. We shall thus  improve our minds, and have a jolly good time as well. I shouldn't  wonder if one mightn't borrow a gun from some friendly native, and do a  bit of rabbit shooting here and there. From what I saw of Comrade  Outwood during our brief interview, I shouldn't think he was one of the  lynx-eyed contingent. With tact we ought to be able to slip away from  the merry throng of fossil chasers, and do a bit on our own account.\"    \"Good idea,\" said Mike. \"We will. A chap at Wrykyn, called Wyatt, used  to break out at night and shoot at cats with an air pistol.\"    \"It would take a lot to make me do that. I am all against anything that  interferes with my sleep. But rabbits in the daytime is a scheme. We'll  nose about for a gun at the earliest opp. Meanwhile we'd better go up to  Comrade Outwood, and get our names shoved down for the Society.\"    \"I vote we get some tea first somewhere.\"    \"Then let's beat up a study. I suppose they have studies here. Let's go  and look.\"    They went upstairs. On the first floor there was a passage with doors on  either side. Psmith opened the first of these.    \"This'll do us well,\" he said.    It was a biggish room, looking out over the school grounds. There were a  couple of deal tables, two empty bookcases, and a looking glass, hung  on a nail.    \"Might have been made for us,\" said Psmith approvingly.    \"I suppose it belongs to some rotter.\"    \"Not now.\"    \"You aren't going to collar it!\"    \"That,\" said Psmith, looking at himself earnestly in the mirror, and  straightening his tie, \"is the exact program. We must stake out our  claims. This is practical socialism.\"    \"But the real owner's bound to turn up some time or other.\"    \"His misfortune, not ours. You can't expect two masterminds like us to  pig it in that room downstairs. There are moments when one wants to be  alone. It is imperative that we have a place to retire to after a  fatiguing day. And now, if you want to be really useful, come and help  me fetch up my box from downstairs. It's got a gas ring and various  things in it.\"        4    STAKING OUT A CLAIM      Psmith, in the matter of decorating a study and preparing tea in it, was  rather a critic than an executant. He was full of ideas, but he  preferred to allow Mike to carry them out. It was he who suggested that  the wooden bar which ran across the window was unnecessary, but it was  Mike who wrenched it from its place.

As regards deaths  from dysentery, most of the prisoners attacked by the disease came from  the Hedjaz, and were in a seriously weak and exhausted condition.    Turkish prisoners are prepared for burial in the manner prescribed by  their religion. They are buried in a Moslem cemetery. British soldiers  from the garrison pay them the last honours, and the prisoners are  represented at the cemetery.          ~3. Maadi Camp.~    _(Visited on January 3, 1917.)_      The chief camp at Maadi is 9-1/3 miles south of Cairo, on the right bank  of the Nile. All prisoners are taken to it after capture, and thence  distributed among the other camps in Egypt.      _Strength._--Five thousand five hundred and fifty-six Turkish  non-commissioned officers and men, including 1,200 men recently captured  at El Arish in the Sinai peninsula.    No officers are interned in this camp. Three imaums (priests) were not  classed with the officers, as they had served as privates.    The prisoners include--besides Turks--Arabs, Armenians, Greeks, Jews  from Palestine and Mesopotamia, and some Senoussi. Only a small number  have been captives ever since the beginning of the war; a large  proportion come from Gallipoli. We found among the prisoners a boy 8  years old, named Abd-el-Mohsen, who lives in camp with his father.    The camp is divided into 41 sections and 4 quarters. The last are  divided off from one another by barbed wire fences.      _Accommodation._--The quarters of the Turkish prisoners in Maadi Camp  include: (1) Old buildings originally erected as a school of music and  subsequently used as a factory; (2) barracks built recently for  prisoners of war.    The first consist chiefly of a huge hall 252 feet long and 49 feet wide,  with many large openings in the walls. The roof, of match-boarding, is  33 feet above the floor. Standpipes are fixed all along the hall. There  are, in addition, some out-buildings used by the management and as  stores.    In the other camp sections new barracks, measuring as a rule 100 by 39  feet, were erected by a building firm. Walls and roof are of wood and  thatch; the floor is hard-beaten earth. All camp quarters are well open  to the air, so that proper ventilation presents no difficulties.      _Sleeping Accommodation._--Lengthwise of all the quarters run platforms  of beaten earth, 6-1/2 feet wide, and 9 inches above the floor. On these  are placed the woven rush mats which serve for beds. Each prisoner has 3  blankets. During the season when the temperature falls appreciably at  night extra blankets are served out. All bedding is cleaned and  disinfected at regular intervals. Shelves whereon the prisoners can keep  their belongings are fixed between the rows of beds.      _Food._--The food of the prisoners of war is according to the scale  already given. Kitchens are provided in each section and staffed by the  prisoners themselves. We tasted the soup and meat stew, and found them  of good quality and very appetising. The prisoners receive _baladi_ or  native bread, which resembles their usual food and is supplied by Cairo  bakeries. We questioned many of the men, who assured us that they were  satisfied with the food. The only complaint noted by us was that of a  man who thought that he got rice too often. A small canteen supplies  black coffee, sweetened, at a farthing per cup. It is run as a private  concern under the supervision of the authorities. Tobacco is  distributed every Thursday on the scale mentioned previously.      _Clothing._--Soon after their arrival in camp the prisoners were taken  to a large courtyard, in which they stripped off all their clothes and  foot-gear. As a health precaution all this stuff was scrapped and  destroyed. After being disinfected, the men received a complete new  outfit consisting of two pairs of drawers and two flannel shirts, a  cholera belt, socks, a pair of trousers and a dark blue cloth tunic with  linen lining and uniform buttons, and a red fez. Leather slippers for  privates and shoes for sergeants and corporals complete the outfit, the  smartness of which leaves nothing to be desired. Although on the day of  our visit the thermometer stood at about 53 deg.F. many of the men were also  wearing their thick cloth overcoats. Every prisoner has fastened in his  tunic a small metal plate bearing his registration number.  Non-commissioned officers are distinguished by a white linen armlet,  crossed by a blue band for corporals, and by a red band for sergeants.  The sergeant-major wears a red armlet.      _Hygiene._--The drinking-water used in camp is drawn by two steam pumps  from a well sunk to a great depth close to the Nile. The Nile water,  after passing through a kind of natural filter, is thus lifted into a  reservoir above the camp, and is distributed in all directions by  gravity. The bacteriological analysis made every week when the supply  was first opened--now once a month--showed the water to be perfectly  pure.    Water for washing purposes is plentiful. Hot and cold shower-baths are  installed throughout the camp. The prisoners are obliged to use them  once a week, but may, if they choose, have a bath four times a day. In  summer especially the baths are never idle.    Prisoners get plenty of soap and wash their own linen on wooden tables  arranged under water taps.    Two high-pressure steam disinfecting chambers serve the camp, and once a  week all blankets are passed through them. The camp contains no fleas,  lice, or bugs.    The day latrines are 100 yards from the living quarters. They are of the  Turkish kind, with movable tubs--1 tub for every 10 men. Every tub  contains some cresol solution. The night-soil is removed daily by the  Cairo road authorities and converted into manure. Some latrines close to  the barracks are kept for night use and are locked up during the day.      _Medical Attention._--The medical service of Maadi Camp is in the hands  of head-doctor Captain Scrimgeour, who in time of peace practised in  Nazareth. He is assisted by an English doctor-adjutant, and 4 Arab  doctors, natives of Syria. All these doctors speak Turkish and Arabic.  Nine English orderlies and 12 Turkish orderlies carry out the sick  duties. A dentist comes to camp when required.    The infirmary included three well-appointed quarters built in masonry,  and able to hold 40 patients.    The infirmary bedding accommodation consists of iron bedsteads with  spring mattress and stuffed mattress. The blankets are warm and  unlimited in number.      _Illness._--Every morning 300-400 prisoners come on sick parade. This  number represents about 8 per cent. of the strength. Although these men  often come to be treated for trifling ailments, such as slight  constipation, or even a small boil, the doctors make it a rule not to  prevent anyone going sick, as this course enables them to keep the  closer watch upon the health of the camp.    On the occasion of our visit there were in the infirmary 7 men laid up:  1 with itch, 1 with diarrhoea, 1 with neuralgia, 1 with an abscess in  the neck, 1 with articular rheumatism, and 1 with gastritis. A prisoner  who had been trepanned by the doctors on account of damage done to his  skull before his capture, was gradually recovering the power of motion  and his normal sensibility.    Since the camp was opened there have been 35 cases of tertian ague, all  from the Hedjaz, Mecca, Taif and Jeddah; but no case of aggravated  malaria. Eleven cases of tuberculosis were sent into the Egyptian Red  Cross hospitals and to that at Abbassiah. Six cases of trachoma are now  undergoing treatment with applications of protargol. In summer there  have been a few cases of ordinary diarrhoea. The camp has not suffered  from dysentery, typhoid, typhus, nor any other epidemic disease.    All prisoners are inoculated against smallpox, typhoid and cholera.      _The Severely Wounded and those who have lost Limbs._--A special  quarter of the camp contains 55 men who have lost limbs in the war. They  are provided with the most perfect prothesis apparatus, jointed  artificial limbs. Among them are 2 blind men. Sixty other wounded who  have escaped more lightly suffer from stiffness of the joints, ankylosis  and atrophy. They are well provided with sticks and crutches.      _Deaths._--Two aged prisoners have died in the camp, both from apoplexy.  They were interred with military honours in the Moslem burial-ground  nearest to the camp.      _Exercise._--No limit is placed upon the time during which exercise may  be taken in the open space round the barracks.      _Work._--The prisoners have not to do work. Several attempts have been  made to teach them boot-making, but their results were so unpromising  that they were given up. Although there are many agriculturists among  the prisoners, it would not do to use them for work on the land along  with the natives, owing to the ease with which they could escape and the  need for having many soldiers to guard them. However, for some weeks  past the camp commandant has made trial of using some prisoners for  market gardening on lands beside the Nile, just outside the camp.      _Discipline._--Under the head of discipline there are hardly any  complaints to make, and punishment has rarely had to be inflicted. One  case of escape was punished with three months' imprisonment without any  alteration in diet. Only tobacco was cut off. An old offender was  brought before a court-martial, and sentenced by it to six months'  imprisonment. The prison quarters are cells built entirely of cement,  with two barred windows well above the ground to light the chamber,  which is of ample size."]]]
