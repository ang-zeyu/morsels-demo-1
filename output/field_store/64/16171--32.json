This offering niche is the door of the other world  --symbolically and actually.  In many graves the niche is carved  to represent a door--sometimes opening in, and sometimes  opening out.  Moreover, in several cases the figure of the dead is  carved half emerging from the opening door--a figure in all  ways like the figure of the dead as he is represented in the  scenes from life.  Beyond this door lives the spirit of the dead.    In many offering chambers there is a small hole in the wall,  either in the offering niche or in another place.  If this hole be  properly lighted and the space beyond has not been changed by  decay or violation, the light falls on the face of a statue of  the dead looking forth to the world of the living.  For behind the  wall is another chamber, closed except for this small hole.  This  hidden chamber contains statues of the dead often accompanied by  statues of his family and his servants.  These statues of the dead  are labeled with his name, and are said to be the abode of his  spirit, his _ka_, as the Egyptians called it.  Moreover, all the  offering formulas named the _ka_ as the recipient of the food and  drink.  The duplicate spirit of the man is his _ka_.  In these  statues we have, then, a simulacrum of the man provided for use  of his _ka_--perhaps to assist the _ka_ to the persistence of  his earthly form, and to the remembrance of his name.  But what  were the uses of the subsidiary statues?  What spirit resided in  them?  The man's son in his turn died, and a similar room was made  for him with his statue and his subsidiary statues.  Did his _ka_  live both in the statue placed with his father's statue and also  in the statue in his own grave?  We have no answer.  Probably the  Egyptian mind never formulated the difficulty.    But the new idea is clearly expressed.  It is no longer necessary  to fill the burial chamber with a mass of household furniture for  the use of the dead.  All these things can be carved on the wall  of the burial chamber and so made effective for his use.  It was  in any case necessary to supply his food by means of the  offerings, and it was quite as easy to supply all his other  necessities in the same way.  In other words, there is a distinct  growth in the use of magic to benefit the dead.  At the same time,  we find the growth of the custom of supplying a special abode for  the _ka_--a simulacrum of the man, which assisted the _ka_ to  retain the form of the living man and to remember his identity.    The tendency of this period is then to place a greater dependence  on magic than on food, drink, and grave furniture.  It is,  therefore, not surprising to find introduced, for the first time,  the use of magical texts in the burial chamber,--the so-called  Pyramid Texts.  In the burial chamber in the pyramid of Unas, last  king of the Fifth Dynasty, and in the pyramids of the kings of  the Sixth Dynasty, the walls are covered with long magical texts  or chapters--the oldest form of the so-called book of the dead  or \"book of the going forth by day.\" The texts were probably  somewhat older, but are now used for the first time in this  manner, no doubt owing to the increased facility in carving  stone.  In these the various powers of the other world are invoked  by the incidents of the Osiris-Isis legend, to preserve the dead  body, to feed the _ka_, and to assist the other spirit, the _ba_,  in its struggles with supernatural powers.    The pyramid texts introduce us to three important ideas,--(1) a  curious plurality of the spirit existence, (2) a condition of  immortality better than that of the old underworld or Earu, and  (3) most important of all, the identification of the king with  Osiris according to the terms of the Osiris-Isis legend.    In all the older offering formulas it is only the _ka_ spirit  which is mentioned.  Here is the body perishable and destructible;  here is the life, the _ka_ which fills every limb and vessel of  the body and must, therefore, have the same form.  When death  comes, the _ka_ spirit, the image of the man, remains near the  body, and this spirit it was which was the object of the rites  and offerings in the funerary chapel.  But besides this _ka_, it  appears for the first time that the king at any rate possesses  also a soul called a _ba_.  In later times we see that every man  possessed a _ba_, and we learn that each god possessed several  _ba's_.  But it is in the pyramid texts that we learn for the  first time of the _ba_ of a man, and that man is a king.  When  death comes, the _ba_ takes flight in the form of a bird or  whatever form it wills.  All seems confused.  The _ka_ was near the  body, the _ka_ was in the field of Earu, under the earth  ploughing and sowing; the _ba_ is fluttering on the branches of  the tree on earth, the _ba_ has fled like a falcon to the  heavens, and has been set as a star among the stars.  The dead  king lives with the gods and is fed by them.  The goddesses give  him the breast.  He lives in the Island of Food.  He lives in Earu,  the Underworld, a land like Egypt, with fields and canals and  flood and harvest.  He shares with the gods in the offerings made  in the great temples on earth.    It is quite clear that all this is an expression of  dissatisfaction with the old belief in the simple duplicate  world, the world of Earu under the earth.  It is noteworthy that  this first appears in royal tombs.  These texts are written for  kings alone.  It is only many centuries later that the texts of  the book of the dead showed similar possibilities open to the  common man.  This is the usual course of all advances in Egypt,--  architecture, sculpture, writing, whatever gain in skill or  knowledge there is, appears first in the service of the royal  family.  Thus, even in the conception of immortality, the new  ideas, the better immortality was first thought out for the  benefit of the king.  The basis for this lay simply in the life on  earth.  The king had come early to have a sort of divinity  ascribed to him.  His chief name was the Horus name.  Menes was the  Horus Aha; Cheops was the Horus Mejeru; Pepy II was the Horus  Netery-khau.  But he was also the son of Ra, the sun-god, endued  with life forever.  The king was a god, and it could only be that  in his future life he shared the life of the gods.  Thus, all is  no more confused or mysterious than is the conception of the life  of the gods themselves.    But the texts go even further than this and identify the dead  god-man, who as Horus was king on earth, with the father of  Horus, the dead god of the earth, Osiris.  This identification of  the dead man with the dead god Osiris was later enlarged to  include all men, and became in the Ptolemaic period the most  characteristic feature of the Egyptian conception of life after  death.    The Osiris story as it can be pieced together from the pyramid  texts [See A. Erman: _Die Aegyptische Religion_, p. 38 ff.] was  briefly thus: Keb, the earth-god, and Nut, the goddess of the  sky, had four children,--Osiris and Isis, Seth and Nephthys,--  who were thus paired in marriage.  Keb gave Osiris his dominion,  the earth, and made him the god of the earth, and he ruled justly  and powerfully.  Seth, his brother, was jealous, and by treachery  enticed Osiris into a box, which he closed and threw into the  water.  Isis sought for the body of her husband until she found it,  and Isis and Nephthys, her sister, sat at his head and feet and  bewailed him.  Re, the greatest of the gods, heard Isis's  complaint; his heart was touched, and he sent Anubis to bury  Osiris.  Anubis re-joined his separated bones, bound him with  cloths, and prepared him for burial,--that is, mummified him.  This is the form in which Osiris is represented,--as a mummy.  Isis then fanned her wings, and the air from her wings caused the  mummy to live.  His life on earth, however, was over, could not be  recalled, so that his new life could only be passed in the other  world, the world of the dead.  Here Osiris became king, as he had  been king on earth.  But Isis conceived from the dead-living  Osiris, bore a child in secret, and suckled him, hidden in a  swamp.  When the child, the sun-god Horus, grew up, he fought  against Seth to recover his father's kingdom, and to avenge his  death.  Both gods were injured in the fight.  Horus lost an eye.  But Thoth intervened, separated the fighters, and healed their  wounds.  Thoth spat upon the eye of Horus and it became whole.  Horus, however, gave his eye to Osiris to eat, and thereby Osiris  became endowed with life, soul, and power (i.e. in the underworld).  But Seth disputed the legitimacy of the birth of Horus, and the  great gods held a court in the house of Keb.  In this court,  justice was done, the truth of Horus's claims was established,  and he was placed on the throne of his father. Osiris became  the ruler in the land of the dead, Horus in the land of the  living.    The kernel of the story appears to be this: Osiris is the god of  the earth, and his life is the life of the vegetation, dying and  reviving with the course of the seasons, mourned by his wife Isis  and succeeded by his son Horus, the sun-god.  It is apparently a  form of the common Tammuz or Adonis story of the Semites.  This  fact brings with it a suggestion which requires consideration.    The racial connection of the Egyptians may seem to have little to  do with immortality.  But I beg a moment's consideration.  The two  great dominating ideas of immortality are those held by the  Christians and by the Mohammedans, and these are essentially the  same idea.  Both these religions are creations of the Semitic  race.  It is, therefore, decidedly of importance to find that the  Egyptian race, the creator of a third great religion, has also a  large Semitic strain.  In fact, the investigations of the last ten  years appear to show that this Semitic strain it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12259"],[0,"Memoirs of a Cavalier (#3)"],[1,"part  to us that is now published.

MEMOIRS OF A CAVALIER.    PART I.      It may suffice the reader, without being very inquisitive after my  name, that I was born in the county of Salop, in the year 1608, under  the government of what star I was never astrologer enough to  examine; but the consequences of my life may allow me to suppose some  extraordinary influence affected my birth.    My father was a gentleman of a very plentiful fortune, having an  estate of above L5000 per annum, of a family nearly allied to several  of the principal nobility, and lived about six miles from the town;  and my mother being at ---- on some particular occasion, was surprised  there at a friend's house, and brought me very safe into the world.    I was my father's second son, and therefore was not altogether so much  slighted as younger sons of good families generally are. But my father  saw something in my genius also which particularly pleased him, and so  made him take extraordinary care of my education.    I was taught, therefore, by the best masters that could be had,  everything that was needful to accomplish a young gentleman for the  world; and at seventeen years old my tutor told my father an academic  education was very proper for a person of quality, and he thought me  very fit for it: so my father entered me of ---- College in Oxford,  where I continued three years.    A collegiate life did not suit me at all, though I loved books well  enough. It was never designed that I should be either a lawyer,  physician, or divine; and I wrote to my father that I thought I had  stayed there long enough for a gentleman, and with his leave I desired  to give him a visit.    During my stay at Oxford, though I passed through the proper exercises  of the house, yet my chief reading was upon history and geography,  as that which pleased my mind best, and supplied me with ideas most  suitable to my genius; by one I understood what great actions had been  done in the world, and by the other I understood where they had been  done.    My father readily complied with my desire of coming home; for besides  that he thought, as I did, that three years' time at the university  was enough, he also most passionately loved me, and began to think of  my settling near him.    At my arrival I found myself extraordinarily caressed by my father,  and he seemed to take a particular delight in my conversation. My  mother, who lived in perfect union with him both in desires and  affection, received me very passionately. Apartments were provided for  me by myself, and horses and servants allowed me in particular.    My father never went a-hunting, an exercise he was exceeding fond of,  but he would have me with him; and it pleased him when he found me  like the sport. I lived thus, in all the pleasures 'twas possible for  me to enjoy, for about a year more, when going out one morning with my  father to hunt a stag, and having had a very hard chase, and gotten  a great way off from home, we had leisure enough to ride gently back;  and as we returned my father took occasion to enter into a serious  discourse with me concerning the manner of my settling in the world.    He told me, with a great deal of passion, that he loved me above all  the rest of his children, and that therefore he intended to do very  well for me; and that my eldest brother being already married  and settled, he had designed the same for me, and proposed a very  advantageous match for me, with a young lady of very extraordinary  fortune and merit, and offered to make a settlement of L2000 per annum  on me, which he said he would purchase for me without diminishing his  paternal estate.    There was too much tenderness in this discourse not to affect me  exceedingly. I told him I would perfectly resign myself unto his  disposal. But as my father had, together with his love for me, a very  nice judgment in his discourse, he fixed his eyes very attentively on  me, and though my answer was without the least reserve, yet he  thought he saw some uneasiness in me at the proposal, and from thence  concluded that my compliance was rather an act of discretion than  inclination; and that, however I seemed so absolutely given up to what  he had proposed, yet my answer was really an effect of my obedience  rather than my choice.    So he returned very quick upon me: \"Look you, son, though I give you  my own thoughts in the matter, yet I would have you be very plain with  me; for if your own choice does not agree with mine, I will be your  adviser, but will never impose upon you, and therefore let me know  your mind freely.\" \"I don't reckon myself capable, sir,\" said I, with  a great deal of respect, \"to make so good a choice for myself as you  can for me; and though my opinion differed from yours, its being your  opinion would reform mine, and my judgment would as readily comply as  my duty.\" \"I gather at least from thence,\" said my father, \"that your  designs lay another way before, however they may comply with mine; and  therefore I would know what it was you would have asked of me if I had  not offered this to you; and you must not deny me your obedience in  this, if you expect I should believe your readiness in the other.\"    \"Sir,\" said I, \"'twas impossible I should lay out for myself just  what you have proposed; but if my inclinations were never so contrary,  though at your command you shall know them, yet I declare them to be  wholly subjected to your order. I confess my thoughts did not tend  towards marriage or a settlement; for, though I had no reason to  question your care of me, yet I thought a gentleman ought always to  see something of the world before he confined himself to any part of  it. And if I had been to ask your consent to anything, it should have  been to give me leave to travel for a short time, in order to qualify  myself to appear at home like a son to so good a father.\"    \"In what capacity would you travel?\" replied my father. \"You must go  abroad either as a private gentleman, as a scholar, or as a soldier.\"  \"If it were in the latter capacity, sir,\" said I, returning pretty  quick, \"I hope I should not misbehave myself; but I am not so  determined as not to be ruled by your judgment.\" \"Truly,\" replied my  father, \"I see no war abroad at this time worth while for a man to  appear in, whether we talk of the cause or the encouragement; and  indeed, son, I am afraid you need not go far for adventures of that  nature, for times seem to look as if this part of Europe would find us  work enough.\" My father spake then relating to the quarrel likely  to happen between the King of England and the Spaniard,' [1] for I  believe he had no notions of a civil war in his head.    In short, my father, perceiving my inclinations very forward to go  abroad, gave me leave to travel, upon condition I would promise to  return in two years at farthest, or sooner, if he sent for me.    While I was at Oxford I happened into the society of a young  gentleman, of a good family, but of a low fortune, being a younger  brother, and who had indeed instilled into me the first desires of  going abroad, and who, I knew, passionately longed to travel, but had  not sufficient allowance to defray his expenses as a gentleman. We  had contracted a very close friendship, and our humours being very  agreeable to one another, we daily enjoyed the conversation of  letters. He was of a generous free temper, without the least  affectation or deceit, a handsome proper person, a strong body, very  good mien, and brave to the last degree. His name was Fielding and we  called him Captain, though it be a very unusual title in a college;  but fate had some hand in the title, for he had certainly the lines of  a soldier drawn in his countenance. I imparted to him the resolutions  I had taken, and how I had my father's consent to go abroad, and would  know his mind whether he would go with me. He sent me word he would go  with all his heart.    My father, when he saw him, for I sent for him immediately to come  to me, mightily approved my choice; so we got our equipage ready, and  came away for London.    'Twas on the 22nd of April 1630, when we embarked at Dover, landed in  a few hours at Calais, and immediately took post for Paris. I shall  not trouble the reader with a journal of my travels, nor with the  description of places, which every geographer can do better than I;  but these Memoirs being only a relation of what happened either to  ourselves, or in our own knowledge, I shall confine myself to that  part of it.    We had indeed some diverting passages in our journey to Paris, as  first, the horse my comrade was upon fell so very lame with a slip  that he could not go, and hardly stand, and the fellow that rid with  us express, pretended to ride away to a town five miles off to get a  fresh horse, and so left us on the road with one horse between two of  us. We followed as well as we could, but being strangers, missed the  way, and wandered a great way out the road. Whether the man performed  in reasonable time or not we could not be sure, but if it had not been  for an old priest, we had never found him. We met this man, by a very  good accident, near a little village whereof he was curate. We spoke  Latin enough just to make him understand us, and he did not speak it  much better himself; but he carried us into the village to his house,  gave us wine and bread, and entertained us with wonderful courtesy.  After this he sent into the village, hired a peasant, and a horse for  my captain, and sent him to guide us into the road. At parting he  made a great many compliments to us in French, which we could just  understand; but the sum was, to"]]]
