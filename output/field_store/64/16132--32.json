It was natural to expect that the system of Dr. Gall, which differed so  widely from the long confirmed habits of thinking, and having to contend  with so many prejudices, should encounter a large host of adversaries;  for if _phrenology_ be true, all other systems of the philosophy of the  human mind must consequently be false. The brain, which, from the  earliest periods, has generally been considered as the seat of our  mental functions, Dr. Gall regards as a congeries of organs, each organ  having a separate function of its own. This system, first promulgated by  him, is now rapidly advancing in the estimation of the world; and its  doctrines, which a few years since were thought too extravagant and  absurd for investigation, are now discussed in a more liberal and candid  manner. The _test_ for the science of phrenology, and a test by which  its validity alone can be tried, consists in an induction of facts and  observations; and by this mode it is that the disciples of Gall and  Spurzheim challenge their antagonists.    After a life of the most indefatigable industry and active benevolence,  Dr. Gall breathed his last at his country house at Montrouge, a short  distance from Paris, on August the 22nd, 1828, at the age of seventy-  one. The examination of his body took place forty hours after death, in  the presence of the following members of the faculty:--Messrs. Fouquier,  J. Cloquet, Dauncey, Fossati, Cassimir-Broussais, Robouane, Sarlandiere,  Fabre-Palaprat, Londe, Costello, Gaubert, Vimont, Jobert, and Marotti.  The exterior appearance of the body presented a considerable falling  away, particularly in the face. The skull was sawed off with the  greatest precaution; the substance of the brain was consistent, and this  organ was firm and perfectly regular.    The funeral of Dr. Gall, which was conducted with as much privacy as  possible, took place at Paris on the 27th of August. He was interred in  the burial-ground of Pere la Chaise, between the tombs of Moliere and La  Fontaine, being attended to the grave by several members of the faculty.  Three _eloges_, or _oraisons funebres_, were delivered at the place of  interment by Professor Broussais, Dr. Fossati, and Dr. Londe.    Broussais informs us, that Dr. Gall possessed most of the social  virtues, particularly beneficence and good-nature--qualities, he  observes, precious in all ranks of society, and which ought to make  amends for many defects; but for Gall, they had only to palliate a  certain roughness of character, which might wound the susceptibility of  delicate persons, although the sick and unfortunate never had to  complain; and, indeed, the doctor ought, in strict justice, to have more  merit in our ideas, from never having once lost sight, in his writings,  of either decency or moderation, particularly when it is remembered how  severely he was attacked in propagating his favourite doctrine.

I have a song of war for knight,    Lay of love for lady bright,    Faery tale to lull the heir,    Goblin grim the maids to scare!                     SIR WALTER SCOTT.    Germany! land of mystery and of mind! birth-place of Schiller and  Goethe, with what emotions does not every lover of romance sit down to  peruse thy own peculiar, dreamy traditions! Thy very name conjures up  visions of demons, and imps, and elfs, and all the creations of faery  land, with their varied legends of _diablerie_, almost incredible in  number and singular in detail--and romance, in his gloomy mood, seems  here to have reared his strong hold.    At a time when a taste for the beauties of German literature is becoming  general throughout this country, we conceive that a few specimens of her  traditions may not be unacceptable to the reader. Few subjects are more  interesting than the popular legends of a country, which are the source  from whence many of our later novelists draw several of their writings:  they offer a field for reflection to the contemplative observer of man;  and those of Germany, although some are disfigured with a little too  much absurdity in their details, are confessedly a mine of wealth to the  lover of research in such matters. Here Schiller first drew the sources  of his inspiration; here Goethe first electrified mankind with his  writings--works which will render both immortal; it is, indeed, a mine  which has been and will bear much working.    We have chosen the following tradition, both on account of the merit it  possesses, and its being the unquestionable origin of Washington  Irving's inimitable _Rip Von Winkle_. Indeed, the similarity of the  story is strikingly obvious. We believe there are several legends on  this subject, which, with the present, probably all refer to the Emperor  Frederic Barbarossa, whose adventures form the source of many a story  among the Germans. The original tale is nearly as follows:--It seems the  emperor was once compelled to conceal himself, with a party of his  followers, amongst the Kyffhauesen mountains; there he still lives, but  is under the influence of magic. He sits with his adherents on a seat  before a stone table, leaning his head upon his hands, seeming to  slumber; but apparently his sleep is very restless, and his head nods,  and seems as if he were going to awake, and his red beard has grown  through the table down to his feet. He takes pretty long naps, not more  than a hundred years in length at a stretch: when his slumber is  interrupted, he is fabled to be very fond of music; and it is said that  there was a party of musicians, who once gave him a regular serenade in  his subterranean retreat, doubtless expecting some wonderful token of  his generosity in return; but they received nothing for their pains but  a number of green boughs, which so disgusted them, that they all threw  them away on their return to earth, save one, who, however, had no  suspicion of its worth, for on showing it to his wife, to his great  astonishment, each leaf became a golden coin.    An author before us observes, that this tale of the emperor's slumbers  cannot, perhaps, be deemed original, and is probably a popular version  of the Seven Sleepers, \"not a little disfigured by the peculiar  superstition of the country.\" The same writer remarks, with justice,  that it is surprising how few are the sources, and how scanty the parent  stock, from whence all the varieties of European legend are derived.  Indeed, the foundation of a great part of these legendary stories seems  to have been the heathen mythology of the different countries, and the  various tales of superstition being handed down from one generation to  another, have gradually assumed the shape they now bear; from whence may  be traced most of our popular superstitions.    THE LEGEND OF THE GOATHERD.      When I behold a football to and fro,      Urged by a throng of players equally,    Methinks I see, resembled in that show,      This round earth poised in the vacant sky.           *       *       *       *       *      And all we learn whereas the game is o'er,    That life is but a dream, and nothing more.                                AMADIS JANRYN.      \"Know'st thou me not?\"----------------    \"Oh, yes, (I cried,) thou art indeed the same.\"                                     GOETHE.    At the peaceful village of Sittendorf dwelt Peter Klaus, the goatherd.  He daily tended his flocks to pasture in the Kyffhaeusen mountains, and  never failed, as evening approached, to muster them in a little mead,  surrounded by a stone wall, preparatory to driving them home; for some  time, however, he had observed, that one of the finest of his herd  regularly disappeared soon after coming to this nook, and did not join  her companions till late. One night, watching her attentively, he  remarked that she slipped through a hole or opening in the wall, on  which he cautiously crept after the animal, and found she was in a cave,  busily engaged in gleaning the grains of corn that fell down singly from  the roof. Peter did not look long before the shower of corn that now  saluted him made him shake his ears, and inflamed his curiosity the more  to discover the cause of so singular an occurrence in that out-of-the-  way place. However, at last he heard the neigh and stamping of horses,  apparently proceed from above; and it was doubtless from their mangers  that the oats had fallen.    While standing, still wrapped in amazement at the singularity of the  adventure, Peter's surprise was not diminished on observing a boy, who,  without saying a word, silently beckoned him to follow. Peter  mechanically obeyed the gestures of the lad, and ascended some steps,  which led over a walled court into a hollow place, completely surrounded  on all sides by lofty rocks, and crowned by the rich foliage of shrubs,  through which an imperfect twilight displayed a smooth, well-trimmed  lawn, that formed the ground he stood upon. Here were twelve knights,  who, without so much as uttering a syllable, were very gravely playing  at nine-pins; and as silently was Peter inducted into the office of  assistant, namely, in setting up these nine-pins. Peter's courage was  none of the strongest "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],[0,"In the Claws of the German Eagle (#3)"],[1,"of his eminence.    I began now a survey of my surroundings. Our room was in fact a  hallway crammed with soldiers and prisoners. The soldiers, with  fixed bayonets in their rifles, stood guard at the door. The  prisoners, some thirty-five in number, were ranged on benches,  overturned boxes, and on the floor. We were of every description,  from well-groomed men of the city to artisans and peasants from  the fields. The most interesting of the peasants was a young fellow  charged with carrying dispatches through the lines to Antwerp. The  most interesting of the well-dressed urban group was a theater  manager charged with making his playhouse the center of  distribution for the forbidden newspapers smuggled into Brussels.  There was a Belgian soldier in uniform, woefully battered and  beaten; and for the first time I saw a German soldier without his  rifle. He, too, was a prisoner waiting trial, having been sent up to  the headquarters accused of muttering against an under officer.    All these facts I learned later. Then I sat paralyzed in an  atmosphere charged with smoke and silence. The smoke came  not from the prisoners, for to them it was forbidden, but from the  soldiers, who rolled it up in great clouds. The silence came from  the suspicion that one's next neighbor might be a spy planted  there to catch him in some unwary statement. Each man would  have sought relief from the strain by unbosoming his hopes and  fears to his neighbor, but he dared not. That is one fearful curse of  any cause that is buttressed by a system of espionage. It scatters  everywhere the seeds of suspicion. All society is shot through with  cynical distrust. It poisons the springs at the very source--one's  faith in his fellows. Ordinarily one regards the next man as a  neighbor until he proves himself a spy. In Europe he is a scoundrel  and a spy until he proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is  a neighbor.    And then one is never certain. People were everywhere aghast to  find even their life-long friends in the pay of the enemy. A large  military establishment draws spies as certainly as a carcass draws  vermin; the one is the inevitable concomitant of the other. It is the  Nemesis of all human brotherhood.    Now to be taken as a prisoner of war was to most men more of a  Godsend than a tragedy. The prisoner knew that he was to be  corralled in a camp. But he was alive at any rate and he had but to  await the end of the war--then it was home again. The pictures  show phalanxes of these men smiling as if they were glad to be  captives. On the other hand there are no smiles in the pictures of  the spies and francs-tireurs. They know that they are fated for a  hasty trial, a drumhead decision, and to be shot at dawn. The  prospect of that walk through the early morning dews to the  execution-ground made their shoulders droop along with their  spirits.    With these thoughts on our mind we held our tongues and kept  our eyes on the door, wondering who would be the next guest to  arrive, and mentally conjecturing what might be the cause of his  incarceration.    The last arrival wore a small American flag wound round his arm,  and around his waist he wore a belt which contained 100 pounds  in gold. He spotted me, and, coming over to my corner, opened up  a conversation in English. I thought at first that this was merely a  clumsy German ruse to trap me into some indiscreet talking. To  his kindly advances I curtly returned \"Yeses\" and \"Noes.\"    His name was Obels, a Belgian by birth but speaking English as  well as German, French, and Flemish. He was an invaluable  reporter for a great Chicago paper, and in his zeal for news had  run smack into the Germans at Malines, and had been at once  whisked off by automobile to Brussels for trial as a spy. He had a  passionate devotion to his calling. No mystic could have been  more consecrated to his Holy Church. I fully believe that he would  have consented to be shot as a spy with a smile on his face if he  could have got the story of the shooting to his paper. He was one  of the most straightforth fellows I have ever met, and yet I  regarded him there as I would a low-browed scoundrel. For a long  time I would not speak to him. I dared not. He might have been a  spy set to worm out any confidences, and then carry them to  Javert.    Left to himself, each man let his most pessimistic thoughts drag  his spirits down. Gloom is contagious, and it soon became as  heavy in the room as the gray clouds of smoke. The one bright,  hopeful spot was the lone woman prisoner. She alone refused to  succumb to the depressing atmosphere, and sought to play  woman's ancient role of comforter. She tried to smile, and  succeeded admirably, for she was very pretty. A wretched-looking  lad huddled up on a bag in the corner tried to reciprocate, but with  the tears glistening in his eyes he made a sorry failure of it. We  were a hard crowd to smile to, and growing tired of her attempts to  appear light-hearted, she at last gave herself up to her own  grievances, and soon was looking quite as doleful as the rest of  us. Our gloom was thrown into sharp relief by a number of soldiers  grouped around a table in the corner laughing and shouting over a  game of cards which they were playing for small stakes. We  dragged out the long afternoon staring doggedly at the bayonets of  our guards.    Only once did the guards show any awareness of our existence.  That was when suddenly the arrival of \"Herr Major\" was announced.  As the door was opened to let him pass through our hall to the stairway,  with a hoarse shout we were ordered to our feet. As his exalted  personage paraded by we stood, hats in hand, with bared heads,  with such humble and respectful expression as may be outwardly  assumed towards a fellow-being whom all secretly despised or  desired to kill. Was there really a murderous gleam in the averted  eyes of those Belgians arrayed in salute before the Herr Major, or  was it my imagination that put it there? Perhaps you can tell.    Picture your country devastated, your towns burned, your flag  prohibited, your farmers shot, your women and children terrified,  your papers and public meetings suppressed, your streets  patrolled by aliens with drawn swords as your enemies' bands  triumphantly play their national airs. Picture, then, yourself lied  about by hireling spies, thrown into prison, compelled to breathe  foul air and sleep upon a floor, fed on black bread, and held day  after day for sentence in nerve-racking suspense. Picture to  yourself now the abject humiliation of being compelled to stand  bare-headed in salute before these wreckers and spoilers of your  land. Do you think you might keep back from your eyes sparks  from that blazing rebellion in your soul? Then it was not  imagination that made me see the murderous gleam in the eyes of  those high-spirited Belgians. \"Salute the Major!\" the Germans  shouted. What seeds of hate those words planted in those Belgian  souls the future will show, when they who sow the wind shall reap  the whirlwind.    That is the unseen horror of war; pictures can reveal the damage  wrought by shot and shell, fire and flood in the blasted cities and in  the fields of the dead. But nothing can ever show the irreparable  spiritual damage wrought to the human soul by hates, humiliations,  fears and undying animosities.          Chapter II    Sweating Under The German Third Degree        By this time my lark-like spirit of the morning had folded its wings.  My musings took on a decidedly somber tinge. \"Were the Germans  going to make a summary example of me to warn outsiders to cease  prowling around the war zone?\" \"Was I going to be railroaded off  to jail, or even worse?\" It was no time to be wool gathering! It was  high time for doing. \"But what pretexts could they find for such action?\"  At any rate I resolved to furnish as few pretexts as possible.    I set to work hunting carefully through my pockets for everything  that might furnish the slightest basis for any charge against me.  Before coming to Brussels I had been warned not to carry  anything that might be the least incriminating, and there was not  much on me; but I did have a pass from the Belgian commander  giving me access to the Antwerp fortifications. I had figured on  framing it as a souvenir of my adventures, but my molars now  reduced it to an unrecognizable pulp. Cards of introduction from  French and English friends fared a similar fate. Their remains were  disposed of in the shuffling that accompanied the arrival of new  prisoners. This had to be done most craftily, for we never knew  where were the spying eyes.    About six o'clock I was resting from my masticatory labors when  Javert presented himself, accompanied by two soldiers. I was led  away into the council room where first I had been taken in the  morning. It was now turned into a trial chamber. Javert, as  prosecutor, was seated on one side of the table, while around the  farther end were ranged some officers and a few men in civilian  clothes who proved to be secret service agents. I stood until the  judge bade me take my seat at the vacant end of the table.    One by one my documents were disposed of--an American  passport issued in London; a permit from the German Consul at  Maastricht, Holland, to enter \"the territory of Belgium-Germany,\"  finally, this letter of introduction from the American Consulate at  Ghent:    Consulat Americain.    Gand le 22 Septembre, 1914.  Le Consul des Etats Unis d'Amerique a Gand, prie Messieurs les  autorites de bien vouloir laisser passer le porteur de la presente  Monsieur Albert Williams, citoyen Americain.    JULIUS VAN HEE,  Consul Americain.    I pointed to the recent date on it, the 22nd of September, and to  the signer of it, Julius van Hee.    Van Hee was a man who met the Germans on their own ground.  He informed the German officer at his hotel: \"If you send any spy  prowling"]]]
