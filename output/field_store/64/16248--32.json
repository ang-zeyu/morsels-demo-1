Ross    EX TOWN SLAVE HANNAH AUSTIN  [HW: about 75-85]  [APR 8 1937]      When the writer was presented to Mrs. Hannah Austin she was immediately  impressed with her alert youthful appearance. Mrs. Austin is well  preserved for her age and speaks clearly and with much intelligence. The  interview was a brief but interesting one. This was due partly to the  fact that Mrs. Austin was a small child when The Civil War ended and too  because her family was classed as \"town slaves\" so classed because of  their superior intelligence.    Mrs. Austin was a child of ten or twelve years when the war ended. She  doesn't know her exact age but estimated it to be between seventy and  seventy five years. She was born the oldest child of Liza and George  Hall. Their master Mr. Frank Hall was very kind to them and considerate  in his treatment of them.    Briefly Mrs. Austin gave the following account of slavery as she knew  it. \"My family lived in a two room well built house which had many  windows and a nice large porch. Our master, Mr. Hall was a merchant and  operated a clothing store. Because Mr. Hall lived in town he did not  need but a few slaves. My family which included my mother, father,  sister, and myself were his only servants. Originally Mr. Hall did not  own any slaves, however after marrying Mrs. Hall we were given to her by  her father as a part of her inheritance.    My mother nursed Mrs. Hall from a baby, consequently the Hall family was  very fond of her and often made the statement that they would not part  with her for anything in the world, besides working as the cook for the  Hall family my mother was also a fine seamstress and made clothing for  the master's family and for our family. We were allowed an ample amount  of good clothing which Mr. Hall selected from the stock in his store. My  father worked as a porter in the store and did other jobs around the  house. I did not have to work and spent most of my time playing with the  Hall children. We were considered the better class of slaves and did not  know the meaning of a hard time.    Other slave owners whipped their slaves severely and often, but I have  never known our master to whip any one of my family. If any one in the  family became ill the family doctor was called in as often as he was  needed.    We did not have churches of our own but were allowed to attend the white  churches in the afternoon. The White families attended in the forenoon.  We seldom heard a true religious sermon; but were constantly preached  the doctrine of obedience to our masters and mistresses. We were  required to attend church every Sunday.    Marriages were conducted in much the same manner as they are today.  After the usual courtship a minister was called in by the master and the  marriage ceremony would then take place. In my opinion people of today  are more lax in their attitude toward marriage than they were in those  days. Following the marriage of a slave couple a celebration would take  place often the master and his family would take part in the  celebration.    I remember hearing my mother and father discuss the war; but was too  young to know just the effect the war would have on the slave. One day I  remember Mr. Hall coming to my mother telling her we were free. His  exact words were quote--\"Liza you don't belong to me any longer you  belong to yourself. If you are hired now I will have to pay you. I do  not want you to leave as you have a home here as long as you live.\" I  watched my mother to see the effect his words would have on her and I  saw her eyes fill with tears. Mr. Hall's eyes filled with tears also.    Soon after this incident a Yankee Army appeared in our village one day.  They practically destroyed Mr. Hall's store by throwing all clothes and  other merchandise into the streets. Seeing my sister and I they turned  to us saying, \"Little Negroes you are free there are no more masters and  mistresses, here help yourselves to these clothes take them home with  you.\" Not knowing any better we carried stockings, socks, dresses,  underwear and many other pieces home. After this they opened the smoke  house door and told us to go in and take all of the meat we wanted.    On another occasion the mistress called me asking that I come in the  yard to play with the children\". Here Mrs. Austin began to laugh and  remarked \"I did not go but politely told her I was free and didn't  belong to any one but my mama and papa. As I spoke these words my  mistress began to cry.    My mother and father continued to live with the Halls even after freedom  and until their deaths. Although not impoverished most of the Hall's  fortune was wiped out with the war\".    Mrs. Austin married at the age of 16 years; and was the mother of four  children, all of whom are dead. She was very ambitious and was  determined to get an education if such was possible. After the war  Northern white people came south and set up schools for the education of  Negroes. She remembers the organization of the old Storrs School from  which one of the present Negroes Colleges originated.    Mrs. Austin proudly spoke of her old blue back speller, which she still  possesses; and of the days when she attended Storrs School.    As the writer made ready to depart Mrs. Austin smilingly informed her  that she had told her all that she knew about slavery; and every word  spoken was the truth.          [HW: Dist. 5  Ex Slave #1  Ross]    \"A FEW FACTS OF SLAVERY\"  As Told by CELESTIA AVERY--EX-SLAVE  [MAY 8 1937]      Mrs. Celestia Avery is a small mulatto woman about 5 ft. in height. She  has a remarkably clear memory in view of the fact that she is about 75  years of age. Before the interview began she reminded the writer that  the facts to be related were either told to her by her grandmother,  Sylvia Heard, or were facts which she remembered herself.    Mrs. Avery was born 75 years ago in Troupe County, LaGrange, Ga. the  eighth oldest child of Lenora and Silas Heard. There were 10 other  children beside herself. She and her family were owned by Mr. & Mrs.  Peter Heard. In those days the slaves carried the surname of their  master; this accounted for all slaves having the same name whether they  were kin or not.    The owner Mr. Heard had a plantation of about 500 acres and was  considered wealthy by all who knew him. Mrs. Avery was unable to give  the exact number of slaves on the plantation, but knew he owned a large  number. Cotton, corn, peas, potatoes, (etc.) were the main crops raised.    The homes provided for the slaves were two room log cabins which had one  door and one window. These homes were not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1361"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Giant Cannon; Or, The Longest Shots on Record (#3)"],[1,"inventor. \"Thank him just the  same. It was only an ordinary faint, caused by the slight electrical  shocks, and by getting a bit nervous, I guess.  I'm all right--see,\"  and he proved it by standing up.    \"He's all right--don't come, doctor,\" said Mr. Damon into the  telephone. \"Bless my keyring!\" he exclaimed, \"but that was a strenuous  time!\"    \"I've been in some tight places before,\" went on Tom, as he sat down in  an easy chair, \"and I've had any number of shocks when I've been  experimenting, but this was a sort of double combination, and it sure  had me guessing. But I'm feeling better every minute.\"    \"A cup of hot tea will do you good,\" said motherly Mrs. Baggert, as she  bustled out of the room. \"I'll make it for you.\"    \"You cut that wire as neatly as any lineman could,\" went on Tom,  glancing from Mr. Peterson out of the window to where one of his  workmen was repairing the break. \"When I flew over it in my airship I  never gave a thought to the trailer from my wireless outfit. The first  I knew I was caught back, and then pulled down to the balloon shed  roof, for I tilted the deflecting rudder by mistake.    \"But, Mr. Peterson,\" Tom went on, \"I haven't seen you in some time.  Anything new on, that brings you here?\" for the fortune-hunter had  called at the Swift house after Tom had gone out to the shop to get his  airship ready for the flight to try the magneto.    \"Well, Tom, I have something rather new on,\" replied Mr. Peterson. \"I  hoped to interest your father in it, but he doesn't seem to care to  take a chance. It's a lost opal mine on a little-known island in the  Caribbean Sea not far from the city of Colon.  I say not far--by that I  mean about twenty miles. But your father doesn't want to invest, say,  ten thousand dollars in it, though I can almost guarantee that he'll  get five times that sum back. So, as long as he doesn't feel that he  can help me out, I guess I'd better be traveling on.\"    \"Hold on! Wait a minute. Don't be in a hurry,\" said Mr. Swift.    Mr. Peterson was an old friend, and when he and Mr. Swift were young  men they had prospected and grub-staked together. But Mr. Swift soon  gave that up to devote his time to his inventions, while Mr. Peterson  became a sort of rolling stone.    He was a good man, but somewhat visionary, and a bit inclined to \"take  chances\"--such as looking for lost treasure--rather than to devote  himself to some steady employment. The result was that he led rather a  precarious life, though never being actually in want.    \"No, pardner,\" he said to Mr. Swift. \"It's kind of you to ask me to  stay; but this mine business has got a grip on me. I want to try it  out. If you won't finance the project someone else may.  I'll say  good-bye, and--\"    \"Now just a minute,\" said Mr. Swift. \"It's true, Alec, I had about made  up my mind not to go into this thing, when this accident happened to  Tom. Now you practically saved his life.  You--\"    \"Oh, pshaw! I only acted on the spur of the moment. Anyone could have  done what I did,\" protested the fortune-hunter.    \"Oh, but you did it!\" insisted Mr. Swift, \"and you did it in the nick  of time. Now I wouldn't for a moment think of offering you a reward for  saving my son's life. But I do feel mighty friendly toward you--not  that I didn't before--but I do want to help you. Alec, I will go into  this business with you. We'll take a chance! I'll invest ten thousand  dollars, and I'm not so awful worried about getting it back,  either--though I don't believe in throwing money away.\"    \"You won't throw it away in this case!\" declared Mr. Peterson, eagerly.  \"I'm sure to find that mine; but it will take a little capital to work  it. That's what I need--capital!\"    \"Well, I'll supply it to the extent of ten thousand dollars,\" said Mr.  Swift. \"Tom, what do you think of it? Am I foolish or not?\"    \"Not a bit of it, Dad!\" cried the young man, who was now himself again.  \"I'm glad you took that chance, for, if you hadn't--well, I would have  supplied the money myself--that's all,\" and he smiled at the  fortune-hunter.          CHAPTER III    PLANNING A BIG GUN      \"BUT, Tom, I don't see how in the world you can ever hope to make a  bigger gun than that.\"    \"I think it can be done, Ned,\" was the quiet answer of the young  inventor. He looked up from some drawings on the table in the office of  one of his shops. \"Now I'll just show you--\"    \"Hold on, Tom. You know I have a very poor head for figures, even if I  do help you out once in a while on some of your work.  Skip the  technical details, and give me the main facts.\"    The two young men--Ned Newton being Tom's special chum--were talking  together over Tom's latest scheme.    It was several days after Tom's accident in the airship, when he had  been saved by the prompt action of Mr. Peterson. That fortune-hunter,  once he had the promise of Mr. Swift to invest in his somewhat  visionary plan of locating a lost opal mine near the Panama Canal, had  left the Swift homestead to arrange for fitting out the expedition of  discovery. He had tried to prevail on Tom to accompany him, and,  failing in that, tried to work on Mr. Damon.    \"Bless my watch chain!\" exclaimed that odd gentleman. \"I would like to  go with you first rate. But I'm so busy--so very busy--that I can't  think of it. I have simply neglected all my affairs, chasing around the  country with Tom Swift. But if Tom goes I--ahem! I think perhaps I  could manage it--ahem!\"    \"I thought you were busy,\" laughed Tom.    \"Oh, well, perhaps I could get a few weeks off. But I'm not going--no,  bless my check book, I must get back to business!\"    But as Mr. Damon was a retired gentleman of wealth, his \"business\" was  more or less of a joke among his friends.    So then, a few days after the departure of Mr. Peterson, Tom and Ned  sat in the former's office, discussing the young inventor's latest  scheme.    \"How big is the biggest gun ever made, Tom?\" asked his chum. \"I mean in  feet, in inches, or in muzzle diameter, however they are measured.\"    \"Well,\" began Tom, \"of course some nation may, in secret, be making a  bigger gun than any I have ever heard of. As far as I know, however,  the largest one ever made for the United States was a sixteen-inch  rifled cannon--that is, it was sixteen inches across at the muzzle, and  I forget just how long. It weighed many tons, however, and it now lies,  or did a few years ago, in a ditch at the Sandy Hook proving grounds.  It was a failure.\"    \"And yet you are figuring on making a cannon with a muzzle thirty  inches across--almost a yard--and fifty feet long and to weigh--\"    \"No one can tell exactly how much it will weigh,\" interrupted Tom. \"And  I'm not altogether certain about the muzzle measurement, nor of the  length. It's sort of in the air at present. Only I don't see why a  larger gun than any that has yet been made, can't be constructed.\"    \"If anybody can invent one, you can, Tom Swift!\" exclaimed Ned,  admiringly.    \"You flatter me!\" exclaimed his chum, with a mock bow.    \"But what good will it be?\" went on Ned. \"Making big guns doesn't help  any in war, that I can see.\"    \"Ned!\" exclaimed Tom, \"you don't look far enough ahead. Now here's my  scheme in a nutshell. You know what Uncle Sam is doing down in his big  ditch; don't you?\"    \"You mean digging the Panama Canal?\"    Yes, the greatest engineering feat of centuries. It is going to make a  big change in the whole world, and the United States is going to  become--if she is not already--a world-power. Now that canal has to be  protected--I mean against the possibility of war. For, though it may  never come, and the chances are it never will, still it may.    \"Uncle Sam has to be ready for it. There never was a more true saying  than 'in time of peace prepare for war.' Preparing for war is, in my  opinion, the best way not to have one.    \"Once the Panama Canal is in operation, and the world-changes  incidental to it have been made, if it should pass into the hands of  some foreign country--as it very possibly might do--the United States  would not only be the laughing-stock of the world, but she would lose  the high place she holds.    \"Now, then, to protect the canal, several things are necessary.  Among  them are big guns--cannon that can shoot a long distance--for if a  foreign nation should send some of their new dreadnaughts over  here--vessels with guns that can shoot many miles--where would the  canal be once a bombardment was opened? It would be ruined in a  day--the immense lock-gates would be destroyed. And, not only from the  guns aboard ships would there be danger, but from siege cannon planted  in Costa Rica, or some South American country below the canal zone.    \"Now, to protect the canal against such an attack we need guns that can  shoot farther, straighter and more powerfully than any at present in  use, and we've got to have the most powerful explosive. In other words,  we've got to beat the biggest guns that are now in existence. And I'm  going to do it, Ned!\"    \"You are?\"    \"Yes, I'm going to invent a cannon that will make the longest shots on  record. I'm going to make a world-beater gun; or, rather, I'm going to  invent it, and have it made, for I guess it would tax this place to the  limit.    \"I've been thinking of this for some time, Ned. I've been puttering  around inventing new magnetos, potato-parers and the like, but this is  my latest hobby. The Panama Canal is a big thing--one of the biggest  things in the world. We need the biggest guns in the world to protect  it.    \"And, listen: Uncle Sam thinks the same way. I understand that the best  men in the service--at West Point, Annapolis and Sandy Hook, as well as  elsewhere--are working in the interest of the United States to perfect  a bigger cannon than any ever before made. In fact, one has just been  constructed, and is going to be tried at the Sandy Hook proving grounds  soon. I'm going to see the "]]]
