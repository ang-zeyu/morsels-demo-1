But whene'er the sinner's cheek  Breaks forth into the precious-streaming tears  Of self-accusing, in our court the wheel  Of justice doth run counter to the edge.  Howe'er that thou may'st profit by thy shame  For errors past, and that henceforth more strength  May arm thee, when thou hear'st the Siren-voice,  Lay thou aside the motive to this grief,  And lend attentive ear, while I unfold  How opposite a way my buried flesh  Should have impell'd thee.  Never didst thou spy  In art or nature aught so passing sweet,  As were the limbs, that in their beauteous frame  Enclos'd me, and are scatter'd now in dust.  If sweetest thing thus fail'd thee with my death,  What, afterward, of mortal should thy wish  Have tempted?  When thou first hadst felt the dart  Of perishable things, in my departing  For better realms, thy wing thou should'st have prun'd  To follow me, and never stoop'd again  To 'bide a second blow for a slight girl,  Or other gaud as transient and as vain.  The new and inexperienc'd bird awaits,  Twice it may be, or thrice, the fowler's aim;  But in the sight of one, whose plumes are full,  In vain the net is spread, the arrow wing'd.\"    I stood, as children silent and asham'd  Stand, list'ning, with their eyes upon the earth,  Acknowledging their fault and self-condemn'd.  And she resum'd: \"If, but to hear thus pains thee,  Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!\"    With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,  Rent from its fibers by a blast, that blows  From off the pole, or from Iarbas' land,  Than I at her behest my visage rais'd:  And thus the face denoting by the beard,  I mark'd the secret sting her words convey'd.    No sooner lifted I mine aspect up,  Than downward sunk that vision I beheld  Of goodly creatures vanish; and mine eyes  Yet unassur'd and wavering, bent their light  On Beatrice.  Towards the animal,  Who joins two natures in one form, she turn'd,  And, even under shadow of her veil,  And parted by the verdant rill, that flow'd  Between, in loveliness appear'd as much  Her former self surpassing, as on earth  All others she surpass'd.  Remorseful goads  Shot sudden through me.  Each thing else, the more  Its love had late beguil'd me, now the more  I Was loathsome.  On my heart so keenly smote  The bitter consciousness, that on the ground  O'erpower'd I fell: and what my state was then,  She knows who was the cause.  When now my strength  Flow'd back, returning outward from the heart,  The lady, whom alone I first had seen,  I found above me.  \"Loose me not,\" she cried:  \"Loose not thy hold;\" and lo! had dragg'd me high  As to my neck into the stream, while she,  Still as she drew me after, swept along,  Swift as a shuttle, bounding o'er the wave.    The blessed shore approaching then was heard  So sweetly, \"Tu asperges me,\" that I  May not remember, much less tell the sound.  The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp'd  My temples, and immerg'd me, where 't was fit  The wave should drench me: and thence raising up,  Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs  Presented me so lav'd, and with their arm  They each did cover me.  \"Here are we nymphs,  And in the heav'n are stars.  Or ever earth  Was visited of Beatrice, we  Appointed for her handmaids, tended on her.  We to her eyes will lead thee; but the light  Of gladness that is in them, well to scan,  Those yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,  Thy sight shall quicken.\"  Thus began their song;  And then they led me to the Gryphon's breast,  While, turn'd toward us, Beatrice stood.  \"Spare not thy vision.  We have stationed thee  Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile  Hath drawn his weapons on thee.\"  As they spake,  A thousand fervent wishes riveted  Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood  Still fix'd toward the Gryphon motionless.  As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus  Within those orbs the twofold being, shone,  For ever varying, in one figure now  Reflected, now in other.  Reader! muse  How wond'rous in my sight it seem'd to mark  A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,  Yet in its imag'd semblance mutable.    Full of amaze, and joyous, while my soul  Fed on the viand, whereof still desire  Grows with satiety, the other three  With gesture, that declar'd a loftier line,  Advanc'd: to their own carol on they came  Dancing in festive ring angelical.    \"Turn, Beatrice!\" was their song: \"O turn  Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,  Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace  Hath measur'd.  Gracious at our pray'r vouchsafe  Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark  Thy second beauty, now conceal'd.\"  O splendour!  O sacred light eternal! who is he  So pale with musing in Pierian shades,  Or with that fount so lavishly imbued,  Whose spirit should not fail him in th' essay  To represent thee such as thou didst seem,  When under cope of the still-chiming heaven  Thou gav'st to open air thy charms reveal'd.          CANTO XXXII    Mine eyes with such an eager coveting,  Were bent to rid them of their ten years' thirst,  No other sense was waking: and e'en they  Were fenc'd on either side from heed of aught;  So tangled in its custom'd toils that smile  Of saintly brightness drew me to itself,  When forcibly toward the left my sight  The sacred virgins turn'd; for from their lips  I heard the warning sounds: \"Too fix'd a gaze!\"    Awhile my vision labor'd; as when late  Upon the' o'erstrained eyes the sun hath smote:  But soon to lesser object, as the view  Was now recover'd (lesser in respect  To that excess of sensible, whence late  I had perforce been sunder'd) on their right  I mark'd that glorious army wheel, and turn,  Against the sun and sev'nfold lights, their front.  As when, their bucklers for protection rais'd,  A well-rang'd troop, with portly banners curl'd,  Wheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground:  E'en thus the goodly regiment of heav'n  Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car  Had slop'd his beam.  Attendant at the wheels  The damsels turn'd; and on the Gryphon mov'd  The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,  No feather on him trembled.  The fair dame  Who through the wave had drawn me, companied  By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,  Whose orbit, rolling, mark'd a lesser arch.    Through the high wood, now void (the more her blame,  Who by the serpent was beguil'd) I past  With step in cadence to the harmony  Angelic.  Onward had we mov'd, as far  Perchance as arrow at three several flights  Full wing'd had sped, when from her station down  Descended Beatrice.  With one voice  All murmur'd  \"Adam,\" circling next a plant  Despoil'd of flowers and leaf on every bough.  Its tresses, spreading more as more they rose,  Were such, as 'midst their forest wilds for height  The Indians might have gaz'd at.  \"Blessed thou!  Gryphon, whose beak hath never pluck'd that tree  Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite  Was warp'd to evil.\"  Round the stately trunk  Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom return'd  The animal twice-gender'd: \"Yea: for so  The generation of the just are sav'd.\"  And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot  He drew it of the widow'd branch, and bound  There left unto the stock whereon it grew.    As when large floods of radiance from above  Stream, with that radiance mingled, which ascends  Next after setting of the scaly sign,  Our plants then burgeon, and each wears anew  His wonted colours, ere the sun have yok'd  Beneath another star his flamy steeds;  Thus putting forth a hue, more faint than rose,  And deeper than the violet, was renew'd  The plant, erewhile in all its branches bare.    Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose.  I understood it not, nor to the end  Endur'd the harmony.  Had I the skill  To pencil forth, how clos'd th' unpitying eyes  Slumb'ring, when Syrinx warbled, (eyes that paid  So dearly for their watching,) then like painter,  That with a model paints, I might design  The manner of my falling into sleep.  But feign who will the slumber cunningly;  I pass it by to when I wak'd, and tell  How suddenly a flash of splendour rent  The curtain of my sleep, and one cries out:  \"Arise, what dost thou?\"  As the chosen three,  On Tabor's mount, admitted to behold  The blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit  Is coveted of angels, and doth make  Perpetual feast in heaven, to themselves  Returning at the word, whence deeper sleeps  Were broken, that they their tribe diminish'd saw,  Both Moses and Elias gone, and chang'd  The stole their master wore: thus to myself  Returning, over me beheld I stand  The piteous one, who cross the stream had brought  My steps.  \"And where,\" all doubting, I exclaim'd,  \"Is Beatrice?\"--\"See her,\" she replied,  \"Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root.  Behold th' associate choir that circles her.  The others, with a melody more sweet  And more profound, journeying to higher realms,  Upon the Gryphon tend.\"  If there her words  Were clos'd, I know not; but mine eyes had now  Ta'en view of her, by whom all other thoughts  Were barr'd admittance.  On the very ground  Alone she sat, as she had there been left  A guard upon the wain, which I beheld  Bound to the twyform beast.  The seven nymphs  Did make themselves a cloister round about her,  And in their hands upheld those lights secure  From blast septentrion and the gusty south.    \"A little while thou shalt be forester here:  And citizen shalt be forever with me,  Of that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman  To profit the misguided world, keep now  Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,  Take heed thou write,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800"],[0,"An Index of The Divine Comedy (#20)"],[1,"fountain turn'd.    And thus the senior, holy and rever'd:  \"That thou at length mayst happily conclude  Thy voyage (to which end I was dispatch'd,  By supplication mov'd and holy love)  Let thy upsoaring vision range, at large,  This garden through: for so, by ray divine  Kindled, thy ken a higher flight shall mount;  And from heav'n's queen, whom fervent I adore,  All gracious aid befriend us; for that I  Am her own faithful Bernard.\"  Like a wight,  Who haply from Croatia wends to see  Our Veronica, and the while 't is shown,  Hangs over it with never-sated gaze,  And, all that he hath heard revolving, saith  Unto himself in thought: \"And didst thou look  E'en thus, O Jesus, my true Lord and God?  And was this semblance thine?\"  So gaz'd I then  Adoring; for the charity of him,  Who musing, in the world that peace enjoy'd,  Stood lively before me.  \"Child of grace!\"  Thus he began: \"thou shalt not knowledge gain  Of this glad being, if thine eyes are held  Still in this depth below.  But search around  The circles, to the furthest, till thou spy  Seated in state, the queen, that of this realm  Is sovran.\"  Straight mine eyes I rais'd; and bright,  As, at the birth of morn, the eastern clime  Above th' horizon, where the sun declines;  To mine eyes, that upward, as from vale  To mountain sped, at th' extreme bound, a part  Excell'd in lustre all the front oppos'd.  And as the glow burns ruddiest o'er the wave,  That waits the sloping beam, which Phaeton  Ill knew to guide, and on each part the light  Diminish'd fades, intensest in the midst;  So burn'd the peaceful oriflame, and slack'd  On every side the living flame decay'd.  And in that midst their sportive pennons wav'd  Thousands of angels; in resplendence each  Distinct, and quaint adornment. At their glee  And carol, smil'd the Lovely One of heav'n,  That joy was in the eyes of all the blest.    Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich,  As is the colouring in fancy's loom,  'T were all too poor to utter the least part  Of that enchantment.  When he saw mine eyes  Intent on her, that charm'd him, Bernard gaz'd  With so exceeding fondness, as infus'd  Ardour into my breast, unfelt before.          CANTO XXXII    Freely the sage, though wrapt in musings high,  Assum'd the teacher's part, and mild began:  \"The wound, that Mary clos'd, she open'd first,  Who sits so beautiful at Mary's feet.  The third in order, underneath her, lo!  Rachel with Beatrice. Sarah next,  Judith, Rebecca, and the gleaner maid,  Meek ancestress of him, who sang the songs  Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood.  All, as I name them, down from deaf to leaf,  Are in gradation throned on the rose.  And from the seventh step, successively,  Adown the breathing tresses of the flow'r  Still doth the file of Hebrew dames proceed.  For these are a partition wall, whereby  The sacred stairs are sever'd, as the faith  In Christ divides them.  On this part, where blooms  Each leaf in full maturity, are set  Such as in Christ, or ere he came, believ'd.  On th' other, where an intersected space  Yet shows the semicircle void, abide  All they, who look'd to Christ already come.  And as our Lady on her glorious stool,  And they who on their stools beneath her sit,  This way distinction make: e'en so on his,  The mighty Baptist that way marks the line  (He who endur'd the desert and the pains  Of martyrdom, and for two years of hell,  Yet still continued holy), and beneath,  Augustin, Francis, Benedict, and the rest,  Thus far from round to round.  So heav'n's decree  Forecasts, this garden equally to fill.  With faith in either view, past or to come,  Learn too, that downward from the step, which cleaves  Midway the twain compartments, none there are  Who place obtain for merit of their own,  But have through others' merit been advanc'd,  On set conditions: spirits all releas'd,  Ere for themselves they had the power to choose.  And, if thou mark and listen to them well,  Their childish looks and voice declare as much.    \"Here, silent as thou art, I know thy doubt;  And gladly will I loose the knot, wherein  Thy subtle thoughts have bound thee.  From this realm  Excluded, chalice no entrance here may find,  No more shall hunger, thirst, or sorrow can.  A law immutable hath establish'd all;  Nor is there aught thou seest, that doth not fit,  Exactly, as the finger to the ring.  It is not therefore without cause, that these,  O'erspeedy comers to immortal life,  Are different in their shares of excellence.  Our Sovran Lord--that settleth this estate  In love and in delight so absolute,  That wish can dare no further--every soul,  Created in his joyous sight to dwell,  With grace at pleasure variously endows.  And for a proof th' effect may well suffice.  And 't is moreover most expressly mark'd  In holy scripture, where the twins are said  To, have struggled in the womb.  Therefore, as grace  Inweaves the coronet, so every brow  Weareth its proper hue of orient light.  And merely in respect to his prime gift,  Not in reward of meritorious deed,  Hath each his several degree assign'd.  In early times with their own innocence  More was not wanting, than the parents' faith,  To save them: those first ages past, behoov'd  That circumcision in the males should imp  The flight of innocent wings: but since the day  Of grace hath come, without baptismal rites  In Christ accomplish'd, innocence herself  Must linger yet below.  Now raise thy view  Unto the visage most resembling Christ:  For, in her splendour only, shalt thou win  The pow'r to look on him.\"  Forthwith I saw  Such floods of gladness on her visage shower'd,  From holy spirits, winging that profound;  That, whatsoever I had yet beheld,  Had not so much suspended me with wonder,  Or shown me such similitude of God.  And he, who had to her descended, once,  On earth, now hail'd in heav'n; and on pois'd wing.  \"Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena,\" sang:  To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court,  From all parts answ'ring, rang: that holier joy  Brooded the deep serene.  \"Father rever'd:  Who deign'st, for me, to quit the pleasant place,  Wherein thou sittest, by eternal lot!  Say, who that angel is, that with such glee  Beholds our queen, and so enamour'd glows  Of her high beauty, that all fire he seems.\"  So I again resorted to the lore  Of my wise teacher, he, whom Mary's charms  Embellish'd, as the sun the morning star;  Who thus in answer spake: \"In him are summ'd,  Whatever of buxomness and free delight  May be in Spirit, or in angel, met:  And so beseems: for that he bare the palm  Down unto Mary, when the Son of God  Vouchsaf'd to clothe him in terrestrial weeds.  Now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words,  And note thou of this just and pious realm  The chiefest nobles.  Those, highest in bliss,  The twain, on each hand next our empress thron'd,  Are as it were two roots unto this rose.  He to the left, the parent, whose rash taste  Proves bitter to his seed; and, on the right,  That ancient father of the holy church,  Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys  Of this sweet flow'r: near whom behold the seer,  That, ere he died, saw all the grievous times  Of the fair bride, who with the lance and nails  Was won.  And, near unto the other, rests  The leader, under whom on manna fed  Th' ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse.  On th' other part, facing to Peter, lo!  Where Anna sits, so well content to look  On her lov'd daughter, that with moveless eye  She chants the loud hosanna: while, oppos'd  To the first father of your mortal kind,  Is Lucia, at whose hest thy lady sped,  When on the edge of ruin clos'd thine eye.    \"But (for the vision hasteneth so an end)  Here break we off, as the good workman doth,  That shapes the cloak according to the cloth:  And to the primal love our ken shall rise;  That thou mayst penetrate the brightness, far  As sight can bear thee.  Yet, alas! in sooth  Beating thy pennons, thinking to advance,  Thou backward fall'st.  Grace then must first be gain'd;  Her grace, whose might can help thee.  Thou in prayer  Seek her: and, with affection, whilst I sue,  Attend, and yield me all thy heart.\"  He said,  And thus the saintly orison began.          CANTO XXXIII    \"O virgin mother, daughter of thy Son,  Created beings all in lowliness  Surpassing, as in height, above them all,  Term by th' eternal counsel pre-ordain'd,  Ennobler of thy nature, so advanc'd  In thee, that its great Maker did not scorn,  Himself, in his own work enclos'd to dwell!  For in thy womb rekindling shone the love  Reveal'd, whose genial influence makes now  This flower to germin in eternal peace!  Here thou to us, of charity and love,  Art, as the noon-day torch: and art, beneath,  To mortal men, of hope a living spring.  So mighty art thou, lady! and so great,  That he who grace desireth, and comes not  To thee for aidance, fain would have desire  Fly without wings.  Nor only him who asks,  Thy bounty succours, but doth freely oft  Forerun the asking.  Whatsoe'er may be  Of excellence in creature, pity mild,  Relenting mercy, large munificence,  Are all combin'd in thee.  Here kneeleth one,  Who of all spirits hath review'd the state,  From the world's lowest gap unto this height.  Suppliant to thee he kneels, imploring grace  For virtue, yet more high to lift his ken  Toward the bliss supreme.  And I, who ne'er  Coveted sight, more fondly, for myself,  Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer,  (And pray they be not scant) that thou wouldst drive  Each cloud of his mortality away;  That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze.  This also I entreat of thee, O queen!  Who canst do what thou wilt! that in him thou  Wouldst after all he hath beheld, preserve  Affection sound, and human passions quell.  Lo!  Where, with Beatrice, many a saint  Stretch their clasp'd hands, in furtherance of my suit!\"    The eyes, that heav'n with love and awe regards,  Fix'd on the suitor, witness'd, how benign  She looks on pious pray'rs:"]]]
