The tomb of  El Abbas, which had a good dome over it, and was often visited by  pilgrims, has been entirely    [p.85] destroyed by the Wahabys. Excepting four or five buildings, now  inhabited by the principal officers of the Pasha, I saw none above the  most common size.    Tayf is supplied with water from two copious wells, one of which is  within the walls, and the other just before one of the gates. The water  is well-tasted, but heavy. The town is celebrated all over Arabia for  its beautiful gardens; but these are situated at the foot of the  mountains which encircle the sandy plain. I did not see any gardens, nor  even a single tree within the walls; and the immediate neighbourhood is  entirely destitute of verdure, which renders a residence here as  melancholy as in any other city of Arabia. The nearest gardens appeared  to be on the S.W. side, at the distance of about half or three quarters  of an hour: on that side also stands a deserted suburb, separated from  the town, with some date-trees among its ruins; it was abandoned long  before the invasion of the Wahabys.    I did not visit any of the gardens. In some of them are small pavilions,  where the people of Tayf pass their festive hours; the most noted of  them are Wady Methna, Wady Selame, and Wady Shemal. The gardens are  watered by wells and by rivulets, which descend from the mountains.  Numerous fruit-trees are found here, together with fields of wheat and  barley. The fruits which I tasted at Tayf were grapes of a very large  size and delicious flavour, figs, quinces, and pomegranates; but all the  other sorts mentioned at Djebel Kora are likewise found here. The  gardens of Tayf are renowned also for the abundance of their roses,  which, like the grapes, are transported to all parts of the Hedjaz. To  these gardens all the great merchants of Mekka formerly retired in  summer; and here the Sherif himself often passed a part of the hot  season: they had all their houses and establishments here, and therefore  lost considerable property, when Tayf was plundered by the Wahabys.    The indigenous inhabitants of Tayf are Arabs, of the tribe of    [p.86] Thekyf, [Of the Thekyf tribes are El Hamde, Beni Mohammed, and  Themale.--Vide Assamy.] who have become settlers: in their possession are  all the gardens adjoining the town, and most of the provision-shops  within its walls. A few Mekkawys are also settled here, but the far  greater part of the foreigners are Indians by origin. As at Djidda,  these people, although born in Arabia, and in some instances established  here for several generations, still preserve the dress and manners of  the Indian Muselmans: some of them are merchants; but the greater part  are druggists, whose trade is of much more importance in the Hedjaz than  in other countries, from the general predilection of all classes for  drugs, perfumes, &c. There are, I believe, no wholesale merchants in  Tayf; I counted in all about fifty shops. Before the Wahaby invasion,  this was a commercial town, to which the Arabs of the country around, at  the distance of many days journey, resorted, that they might pur­chase  articles of dress; while those of the mountains brought caravans of  wheat and barley: it was also a considerable entrepôt for coffee,  brought on camels from the mountains of Yemen by Be­douins, who thus  eluded the heavy duties levied in the harbours of the Arabian coast.  Every thing denotes great misery in the town. At present, the only  imports from the interior are dates, brought by the Ateybe Arabs from  the many fruitful plantations in their territory. The principal streets  abound with beggars, amongst whom are many Indians, who must often be  exposed to perish from absolute hunger; for, during my residence, it  required at least two piastres, (which, according to the actual  exchange, was equal to about one-sixth of a dollar, or ten-pence) to  procure bread enough for a mans daily subsistence. Caravans of  provisions arrived every week, but the want of camels did not allow of a  suffi­cient importation from the coast to lower the price of food; and  although the common class lived principally upon dates, and thus    JOURNEY TO MEKKA    [p.87] consumed none of the provisions brought hither from Mekka; yet I  learned from good authority that there was only a supply for ten days in  Tayf for the Turkish army.    In the time of the Sherif, this town was governed by an officer of his  appointment, named Hakem, himself a sherif, and who nar­rowly escaped  the sword of the Wahabys. He has been restored to his office by Mohammed  Aly; but it is at present merely honorary. Several sherif families of  Mekka are settled here; and the mode of living, the dress, and manners,  appear to be the same as at Mekka; but I had few opportunities of making  observations on this subject.    September 7th. I set out early in the morning from Tayf for Mekka, by  the same road which I had come. There is, as I have already mentioned, a  more northern route, by which caravans may avoid the difficulties of  passing Djebel Kora. The first station from Mekka, on that road, is  Zeyme, short of which, about ten miles, are several steep ascents. Zeyme  is a half-ruined castle, at the eastern extremity of Wady Lymoun, with  copious springs of run­ning water. Wady Lymoun is a fertile valley,  which extends for several hours in the direction of Wady Fatme; it has  many date­plantations, and formerly the ground was cultivated; but this,  I believe, has ceased since the Wahaby invasion: its fruit-gardens, too,  have been ruined. This is the last stage of the Eastern-Syrian Hadj  route, or that which lies to the east of the Great Hedjaz chain, running  from Medina to Mekka. To the S.E. or E.S.E. of Wady Lymoun, is another  fertile valley, called Wady Medyk, where some sherifs are settled, and  where Sherif Ghaleb possessed landed property.    From Zeyme, the road to Tayf leads, on the second day, from Mekka to  Seyl, a rivulet so called, flowing across a plain, which is without  trees, but affords abundance of rich pasture. At Seyl, the road enters a  mountainous tract, through which is a difficult and very narrow passage  of about six hours. The station of    [p.88] this day is Akrab, situated in the upper plain, at about three  hours distance from Tayf, to the northward, and on the same level with  it: thus a traveller reaches Tayf on the fourth day from Mekka. This  route was now impassable, except to large and well-protected caravans,  the hostile Arabs of the Ateybe tribe having frequently made inroads on  that side, and plundered small caravans.    Not far from Tayf I overtook three Arnaut soldiers, each, like myself,  mounted on an ass. At Tayf they had exchanged their money, getting  thirteen piastres of the Cairo mint for one Spanish dollar, which at  Djidda was worth but eleven; they had, therefore, made a common purse of  one thousand dollars, and travelled from Djidda to Tayf, whenever the  road was secure, for the sake of the two piastres which they gained upon  each dollar. They carried the money, sewed in bags, upon their asses;  and having forgotten, perhaps, to leave out any cash for travelling  expenses, they joined me, finding that my travelling sack was well  stocked with provi­sions, and left me to pay for our joint expenses on  the road, when­ever we stopped at the coffee-huts. But they were good-  humoured companions, and the expense was not thrown away.    In passing by Wady Mohram, I assumed the ihram, as being now for the  first time about to visit Mekka and its temple. The ihram consists of  two pieces of linen, or woollen, or cotton cloth, one of which is  wrapped round the loins, and the other thrown over the neck and  shoulders, so as to leave part of the right arm uncovered. Every garment  must be laid aside before this is put on. Any piece of stuff will answer  the purpose; but the law ordains that there shall be no seams in it, nor  any silk or orna­ments; and white is considered preferable to any other  colour. White Indian cambric is usually employed for the purpose; but  rich hadjys use, instead of it, white Cashmere shawls, which have not  flowered borders. The head remains totally uncovered. It is not  permitted to have the head shaved, in conformity with the oriental  habits, until it is permitted also to lay aside the ihram.    [p.89] The instep must likewise be uncovered: those, accordingly, who  wear shoes, either cut a piece out of the upper leather, or have shoes  made on purpose, such as the Turkish hadjys usually bring with them from  Constantinople. Like most of the natives, I wore sandals while dressed  in the ihram.    Old-age and disease are excuses for keeping the head covered; but this  indulgence must be purchased by giving alms to the poor. The suns rays  become extremely troublesome to persons bare­headed; but although the  law forbids that the head should be protected by any thing in immediate  contact with it, there is no prohibition against the use of umbrellas,  and with these most of the northern hadjys are provided, while the  natives either brave the suns rays, or merely tie a rag to a stick, and  make a little shade, by turning it towards the sun.    Whether assumed in summer or in winter, the ihram is equally  inconvenient and prejudicial to health, particularly among the northern  Mohammedans, who, accustomed to thick woollen clothes, are at this  period obliged to leave them off for many days; yet the religious zeal  of some who visit the Hedjaz is so ardent, that if they arrive even  several months previous to the Hadj, they vow on taking the ihram, in  approaching Mekka, not to throw it off till after the completion of  their pilgrimage to Arafat; and thus they remain for months covered,  night and day, only with this thin cloak; [The Arabian historians relate  that Haroun Errashid and his wife Zobeyda once performed the pilgrimage  on foot, from Baghdad"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9479"],[0,"The Boy Life of Napoleon, Afterwards Emperor of the French (#20)"],[1,"d\"--Napoleon at the Battle of Jena. (From the Painting by Horace  Vernet_.)]    \"Bah!\" broke in the old veteran. \"You are all owls, you! What if they  did? I will not deny either the Duke of Nemours nor the Prince of  Joinville, nor  Louis Philippe himself. But what then? You need not  deny, you youngster, nor you, the other shouters, that when the cannons  boom, when the battles rage, when, above all, one is conqueror for  France, there is something of my emperor in that. Could they have  conquered except for him? Ten thousand bullets! I say. He is  everywhere.\"    \"But, see here, Father Nonesuch,\" protested the Corsican, \"you must not  deny to me the emperor's birth; for I know, I know all about it. Was not  my mother, Saveria, Madame Letitia's servant? Was she not, too, nurse to  the little Napoleon? She was, my faith! And she has told me a hundred  times all about him. I know of what I speak. Our emperor, Napoleon  Bonaparte, was born on the fifteenth of August, 1769, and when he was  a baby, the cradle not being at hand, he was laid upon a rug in Madame  Letitia's room. And on that rug was a fine representation of Mars, the  god of war. And because his bed on that rug was on the very spot which  represented Mars, that, old Nonesuch, is why our emperor was ever  valiant in war. What say you to that?\"    \"Oh, very well, very well,\" said old Nonesuch, as if he made a great  concession; \"if you say so from your own knowledge, if you insist that  he was born, let it go so. I admit that he was born. But as to his being  dead, eh? Will you insist on that too?\"    \"And why not?\" replied the Corsican, still harping on his personal  knowledge of things in Ajaccio. \"I knew the Bonapartes well, I tell you.  There was the father, Papa Charles, a fine, noble-looking man; and their  uncle, the canon--ah! he was a good man. He was short and fat and bald,  with little eyes, but with a look like an eagle. And the children!  how often I have seen them, though they were older than I--Joseph and  Lucien, and little Louis, and Eliza and Pauline and Caroline. Yes; I saw  them often. And Napoleon too. They say he never played much. But you  knew him at Brienne school, old Nonesuch.\"    \"Yes,\" nodded the old veteran; \"for there my father was the porter.\"    \"He was ever grave and stern, was Napoleon;--not wicked, though\"--\"No,  no; never wicked,\" broke in old Nonesuch. \"I remember his snow-ball  fight.\"    \"A fight with snow-balls!\" exclaimed the youngster. \"Yes; with  snow-balls, youngster,\" replied old None-such.    [Illustration: \"'The Emperor was--the Emperor' cried old Nonesuch\"]    \"Did you never hear of it? But you are too young. Only the Corsican and  I can remember that;\" and the old man nodded to the Corsican with the  superiority of old age over these \"babies,\" as he called the younger  veterans. \"Let me see,\" said Nonesuch, crossing his wooden leg over his  leg of flesh; \"I was the porter's boy at Brienne school. I was there to  blacken my shoes--not mine, you understand, but those of the scholars.  There was much snow that winter. The scholars could not play in the  courts nor out-of-doors. They were forced to walk in the halls. That  wearied them, but it rejoiced me. Why? Because I had but few shoes to  blacken. They could not get them dirty while they remained indoors. But,  look you! one day at recess I saw the scholars all out-of-doors,--all  out in the snow. 'Alas! alas! my poor shoes,' said I. It made me sad. I  hid behind the greenhouse doors, to see the meaning of this disorder.  Then I heard a sudden shout. 'Brooms, brooms! shovels, shovels!' they  cried. They rushed into the greenhouse: they took whatever they could  find; and one boy, who saw me standing idle, pushed me toward the door,  crying, 'Here, lazy-bones! take a shovel, take a broom! Get to work,  and help us!'--'Help you do what?' said I. 'To make the fort and roll  snow-balls,' he replied. 'Not I; it is too cold,' I answered. Then the  boys laughed at me. My faith! to-day I think they were right. Then they  tried to push me out-of-doors, I resisted; I would not go. Suddenly  appeared one whom I did not know. He said nothing. He simply looked at  me. He signed to me to take a broom--to march into the garden--to set to  work. And I obeyed. I dared not resist. I did whatever he told me; and,  my faith! so, too, did all the boys. 'Is this one a teacher?' I asked  one of the scholars. 'He does not look so; he is too small and pale  and thin.'--'No,' replied the boy; 'it is Napoleon.'--'And who is  Napoleon?' I asked; for at that time I was as ignorant as all of you  here. 'Is he our patron? Is he the king? Is he the pope?'--'No; he is  Napoleon,' the boy replied again, shrugging his shoulders. I did not ask  more. The boy was right. Napoleon was neither boy nor man, patron,  king, nor pope; he was Napoleon! You should have seen him while we  were working. His hand was pointing continually,--here, there,  everywhere,--indicating what he wished to have done; his clear voice was  ever explaining or commanding. Then, when we had cut paths in the snow,  and had built ramparts, dug trenches, raised fortifications, rolled  snow-balls--then the attack began. I had nothing more to do, I looked  on. But my heart beat fast; I wished that I might fight also. But I was  the porter's son, and did not dare to join in the scholars' play. Every  day for a week, while the snow lasted, the war was fought at each  recess. Snow-balls flew through the air, striking heads, faces, breasts,  backs. The shouting and the tumult gave me great pleasure; but, oh! the  shoes I had to blacken! Then I said to myself, 'I wish to be a soldier.'  And I kept my word.\"          CHAPTER NINETEEN.    THE LITTLE CORPORAL.    \"But why,\" asked the Corsican, as old Nonesuch concluded his story, and  all the veterans applauded with cane and boot, \"why did you not say, 'I  wish to be a general,' and keep your word. Others like you have been  soldiers of the emperor--and generals, marshals, princes.\"    \"Yes, Corsican,\" replied old Nonesuch sadly; \"what you say is true. But  I will tell you what prevented my advancement. I did not know how to  read as well as a lot of the schemers who were in my regiment. In fact,\"  old Nonesuch confessed, \"I could not write; I could not read at all.\"    \"Why did you not learn, then, father?\" asked one of the veterans, who,  because he sat up late every night to read the daily paper, was called  by his comrades \"the scholar.\"    \"I did try to learn, Mr. Scholar,\" replied old Nonesuch, taking a pinch  of snuff from the Corsican's box; \"but indeed it was not in the blood,  don't you see? Not one of my family could read or write; and then I saw  so much trouble over the pens and the books when I was blackening my  boots at Brienne school, that then I had no wish to learn. 'It is all  vexation,' I said. And when I became a soldier, what do you suppose  prevented my learning?\"    \"Were your brains shot away, old Nonesuch?\" queried the scholar  sarcastically.    \"My brains, say you!\" the old man cried indignantly. \"And if they had  been, Mr. Scholar, I would still have more than you. No; it was an  adventure I had after Austerlitz. Ah, what a battle was that! I had the  good luck there to have this leg that I have not now, carried away by a  cannon-ball\"--    \"Good luck! says he,\" broke in the youngster. \"And how good luck, Father  Nonesuch?\"    \"Tut, tut! boys are so impatient,\" said old Nonesuch with a frown. \"Yes,  youngster, good luck, said I. Well, one day, after I had my timber-toe  put on, the emperor, who always had thoughts for those of his soldiers  who had been wounded, gave notice that he had certain small places at  his disposal which he wished to distribute among us crippled ones, in  order that we might rest from war. Then all of us set to wondering,  'What can I do? What shall I ask for? What do I like best to do?' My  wish was never to leave my own general. He was General Junot\"--    \"Ah, yes! I know of him,\" said the Corsican. \"He married a Corsican  girl, Laura Permon, a friend of the Bonaparte children.\"    [Illustration: \"_I know not if I know,' said I_.\"]    \"The same,\" old Nonesuch said, with a nod at his comrade. \"Now, I saw  that the person who was nearest to my General Junot was his secretary.  One day, when I was at Paris, the emperor, I was told, was to review his  troops in the courtyard of the Tuileries; so I dressed myself in my  best,--it was a grenadier's uniform,--a comrade wrote on a piece of  paper my desire; and, with my paper in my hand, I posted myself near a  battalion of lancers. 'The emperor will see me here,' said I. In truth,  he did come; he did see me. He came towards me, and, with the look that  pierced me through,--ten thousand bullets! as the plough cuts through  the ground,--'Are you not an Egyptian, my grenadier?' he asked me. (You  know, Corsican, he called all of us Egyptians who had fought with him in  Egypt.) 'Yes, my Emperor,' I replied, so glorified to see that he  recognized me, that, my faith! my heart swelled and swelled, so that I  thought it would crack with pride, and burst my coat open. The emperor  took the paper I held out toward him. He read it. 'So, so, my Egyptian!  you wish to be a secretary, eh?'--'Yes, my Emperor,' I answered. 'Do you  know how to read and write?' said he. 'Eh? Why! I know not if I know,'  said I. 'What! You do not know if you know?' he repeated. 'Why, no, my  Emperor,' said I; 'for, look you! I have never tried; but perhaps I do  know.' The emperor pulled my ear, as much as to say, 'Well, here is an  odd one!' 'But,' said he, 'to be a secretary one must know how to read  and write, comrade.' He called me his comrade, see you--me, who had  blackened his shoes at Brienne. I was the emperor's comrade. He had said  it. The tears came to my eyes for joy. 'Ah, then, my Emperor, let us say  no more about it,' said I. 'But if you would promise to learn,' said he.  'Oh, as for that,"]]]
