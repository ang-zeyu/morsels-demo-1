Pay  attention please.    _(b) Thought-Forms._    Every one of us, as he thinks, feels and wills, sends forth Thought-Forms  and Thought-Waves of greater or lesser intensity. This force once set  into motion persists, for a greater or lesser period of time, in  Ether. Thought-Force is the concentration of a high form of vibratory  energy in the Akasa (universal ether) and the ether, as you know,  permeates all space, interpenetrates and pervades all forms of matter,  from atom to the sun and the stars. Just as the light-waves of a star  exist and move on centuries after the star has ceased to be, just as the  heat-vibrations remain in a room even after the producing cause has been  removed, similarly mentative energy and its corresponding Thought-Forms  persist in the ether even after the originating impulse has been  withdrawn.    _(c) Thought-Atmosphere._    In this way places, houses, cities and temples have peculiar  Thought-Atmospheres of their own, imparted by those living there,  exerting an influence upon every one living or going there. These are  positive, animating, purifying and exalting Thought-Atmospheres, and  there are negative, weakening and unholy, morbid Thought-Atmospheres.    The higher and loftier your tone of general Thought-Activity, the  finer and more powerful the vibrational nature of the energy emanating  from you. The quality of the thought determines the rate of vibration.  For instance, photographs have been taken through highly-sensitized  plates, indicating the nature of the energy generated. Tongues of flame,  brilliant and flashing with golden-yellow, were photographed from prayer  and devotion. Rotary forms spreading out in ever widening circles of  intense power appeared from lofty enthusiasm in a noble cause. Dark,  murky, cloudy forms resulted from fear, morbidness and worry, and so on.    _(d) The Human Aura._    Similarly each human organism has an 'Aura' of Thought-Force around it,  having its own peculiar rate of vibration, its peculiar forms of colour,  etc. This 'Aura' is an extension of our physical, mental and spiritual  energies.    _(e) The Adductive Power of Thought._    Now as you think, the quality of your thoughts and feelings sets up  a magnetic centre within your Aura, vortices are created, attracting to  yourself similar forms of thought and mentative energy and combining  with other similar forms of energy, reacting upon you and your  circumstances and also wielding an influence upon all such as may come  within its area, radius or field of Force. Thus you see thoughts of the  'I can and I will', 'I do and I dare' type draw similar ones to you, ever  increasing your own stock and at the same time stimulating and energising  all others vibrating in the same key throughout the world. Hence you see  we owe it to ourselves as well as to humanity in general to generate only  positive, loving and lofty thoughts. Just brace up and send forth  fearless, 'I can and I will' thoughts into the world's great reservoir of  thought forces, and you will be surprised at your power to attract  influence, and energise others.    _(f) Thought-Control._    There are four special classes of thoughts that are poisoning the  lives of almost all humanity. They are:--(1) Fear-thoughts, (2)  Hate-thoughts, (3) Sensual-thoughts, (4) Selfish-thoughts. All worry,  doubt, timidty, lack of self-respect, jealousy, spite, malice, envy,  slander, dirty, vicious, will-weakening, health-destroying,  poverty-breeding, soul-killing influences radiate from one or all of  these four. You must cut at their roots and utterly destroy them. In your  efforts follow assiduously the following four rules. They alone can give  you absolute thought-control. They are infallible:    (1) You can break up old thought-habits and build up new ones  by sheer force of Will.    (2) You can easily become great by associating with some strong-willed,  holy, wisdom-steeped soul. This is absolutely necessary and  means the finding of your Guru.    (3) By auto-suggestion, _i.e._, by impressing upon your passive  mind the particular change you would have it work out.    (4) By thought-absorption, _i.e._, by constant meditation on that  one line of thinking.    Now let me give you a few valuable hints on the above four in detail:    (1) & (3). _Character Building_.    You can accomplish this result by tensing the will and by strengthening  the active function of your mind and thus enabling it to \"step in\"  and simply 'command' the passive function to drop the old thought-habit  and take up the new one. This is a magnificent feat and in it only the  strongest succeed. You can obtain good results by combining this with  auto-suggestion. Silently concentrate upon your passive mind and impress  upon it your order. Say to it earnestly, confidently, and masterfully:  'You, my mind, I want you to be fearless, pure, loving and unselfish!'  Picture to yourself in imagination as if you were already these,  and again command and impress your will upon your mind. Do so silently  and constantly and never neglect a chance of expressing these qualities  in action because, at first your mind will rebel, but if 'you' keep up  your efforts determinately and firmly and avail yourself of all  opportunities to 'act out' your will, your mind will end up by accepting  your suggestion and manifesting same naturally as a habit. Some of you  will actually go out of your way to 'act out' a thought when you realise  that the easiest and surest way to check and utterly 'destroy' a  thought-habit is to refuse deliberately to let it manifest in action and  to 'create' a new one all you have got to do is to equally deliberately  'express' it in action and thus clinch it into permanent strength. Also  you must aim at 'thoroughness' and guard against all compromise with your  lower nature. Chastity must be perfect chastity and nothing short of  that, and so on in all development.    (4) _Thought-Absorption._    i. Go away by yourself to some place where you will not be disturbed.  Of course, not always and very rarely can you obtain this condition.  Never mind. Do your best where you are and the great law will at least  find for you all necessary conditions. Shut out all distracting  conditions and impressions from the outer world. After a little effort  you will be able to do so anywhere, at any time, and under any condition.  All mental disturbance is within you.    ii. Now relax, go passive, and draw off all tension from your nerves.  Just you relax your mind and your body will follow suit. A few deep slow  breaths will help the beginner.    iii. Concentrate upon your mind inward steadily, calmly and with  undivided attention.    iv. Fix your thought firmly upon your passive mind and mentally  say, 'You, my mind, are quite _pure_.' Think of this word (with all the  ideas associated therewith) as sinking deeply into your mind and making  a deep impression upon it as a die upon a wax. Let the outward form of  the words 'pure,' 'fearless,' etc., sink into your mind.    v. Form a mental picture of yourself as if you already possessed  all 'purity' and 'courage' and act them out in imagination. Make of it  a pleasant 'day dream.'    vi. Intensify your relaxed condition of mind. Grow as 'limp' as a  rag. Then mentally open yourself out to the inrush of all the  Thought-Forces existing in the ether and connected with positive  thoughts. The effort of this imagination to see this tremendous force  pouring into your brain and body will actually put you _en rapport_ with  same.    vii. Now change from negative to a positive condition and say  vigourously I am '_pure_' and '_strong_' Say it distinctly several times.  Actually speak them out.    viii. Then go out and _live your thoughts out_. This last is the most  important condition.    ix. Practise this daily at the same hour and if possible at the same  place, morning and evening. In fact hold the thought in your mind as  often as possible till it becomes second Nature.    x. Use your power for good or you shall weep eternally. To misuse  occult powers for mean, selfish, or low ends and to prostitute it into  enslaving others weaker than yourselves mentally and physically is the  greatest 'sin' man can commit against man.    (2) _Guru Worship_.    You grow by absorption and assimilation. In order to quicken your  progress you need abstract as well as concrete ideals. The secret of all  rapid and startling spiritual development is man-worship. By man-worship  I mean devotion to, reverence, and intense and all-absorbing passion for  the perfect individual man of realization--a Mahapurusha. Christ, Buddha  and Vivekananda were all such-type men. You must constantly and  thoughtfully meditate upon the lives and writings of saints and heroes.  The formative influence and valuable powers of study and meditation upon  lofty ideas and ideals are incalculable. Man grows by the deepening of  consciousness and the acquirement of wisdom. All study, subjective and  objective, is a _Tapashya_ or Austerity directed to the acquirement of  wisdom. It is the worship of Saraswati--the Goddess of Wisdom. This  worship is definable as perfect emotional solitude, close study, absolute  chastity and celibacy, and at last the merging of the personal into the  impersonal. This austere life is the secret of all greatness. You know  how Archimedes when threatened with death by the vandalistic invaders of  his country raised his head and said 'Please do not disturb my circles'  and nothing more. This man was practising Yoga unconsciously. You must be  able to lose all consciousness of this relative personality, the sure  victim of death and impermanence. You must give up the personal ego that  in the words of Walt Whitman 'is contained within your hat and boots' and  then alone will you realise an infinite individuality. Truly in losing  himself man finds Himself. 'Ye must be born anew'.
