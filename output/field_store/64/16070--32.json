Almost a century lies between Gagnier's biography of Mohammed and that of  the Heidelberg professor Weil (_Mohammed der Prophet, sein Leben and seine  Lehre_, Stuttgart, 1843); and yet Weil did well to call Gagnier his last  independent predecessor. Weil's great merit is, that he is the first in his  field who instituted an extensive historico-critical investigation without  any preconceived opinion. His final opinion of Mohammed is, with the  necessary reservations: \"In so far as he brought the most beautiful  teachings of the Old and the New Testament to a people which was not  illuminated by one ray of faith, he may be regarded, even by those who  are not Mohammedans, as a messenger of God.\" Four years later Caussin  de Perceval in his _Essai sur l'histoire des Arabes_, written quite  independently of Weil, expresses the same idea in these words: \"It would be  an injustice to Mohammed to consider him as no more than a clever impostor,  an ambitious man of genius; he was in the first place a man convinced of  his vocation to deliver his nation from error and to regenerate it.\"    About twenty years later the biography of Mohammed made an enormous advance  through the works of Muir, Sprenger, and Noldeke. On the ground of much  wider and at the same time deeper study of the sources than had been  possible for Weil and Caussin de Perceval, each of these three scholars  gave in his own way an account of the origin of Islam. Noldeke was  much sharper and more cautious in his historical criticism than Muir or  Sprenger. While the biographies written by these two men have now  only historical value, Noldeke's _History of the Qoran_ is still an  indispensable instrument of study more than half a century after its first  appearance.    Numbers of more or less successful efforts to make Mohammed's life  understood by the nineteenth century intellect have followed these without  much permanent gain. Mohammed, who was represented to the public in turn as  deceiver, as a genius mislead by the Devil, as epileptic, as hysteric, and  as prophet, was obliged later on even to submit to playing on the one  hand the part of socialist and, on the other hand, that of a defender of  capitalism. These points of view were principally characteristic of the  temperament of the scholars who held them; they did not really advance our  understanding of the events that took place at Mecca and Medina between 610  and 632 A.D., that prologue to a perplexing historical drama.    The principal source from which all biographers started and to which they  always returned, was the Qoran, the collection of words of Allah spoken by  Mohammed in those twenty-two years. Hardly anyone, amongst the \"faithful\"  and the \"unfaithful,\" doubts the generally authentic character of its  contents except the Parisian professor Casanova.[1] He tried to prove a  little while ago that Mohammed's revelations originally contained the  announcement that the HOUR, the final catastrophe, the Last judgment would  come during his life. When his death had therefore falsified this prophecy,  according to Casanova, the leaders of the young community found themselves  obliged to submit the revelations preserved in writing or memory to a  thorough revision, to add some which announced the mortality even of the  last prophet, and, finally to console the disappointed faithful with the  hope of Mohammed's return before the end of the world. This doctrine of the  return, mentioned neither in the Qoran nor in the eschatological tradition  of later times, according to Casanova was afterwards changed again into the  expectation of the Mahdi, the last of Mohammed's deputies, \"a Guided of  God,\" who shall be descended from Mohammed, bear his name, resemble him  in appearance, and who shall fill the world once more before its end with  justice, as it is now filled with injustice and tyranny.    [Footnote 1: Paul Casanova, _Mohammed et la fin du monde,_ Paris, 1911.  His hypotheses are founded upon Weil's doubts of the authenticity of a few  verses of the _Qoran_ (iii., 138; xxxix., 31, etc.), which doubts were  sufficiently refuted half a century ago by Noldeke in his _Geschichte des  Qorans_, 1st edition, p. 197, etc.]    In our sceptical times there is very little that is above criticism, and  one day or other we may expect to hear that Mohammed never existed. The  arguments for this can hardly be weaker than those of Casanova against the  authenticity of the Qoran. Here we may acknowledge the great power of what  has been believed in all times, in all places, by all the members of the  community (\"quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus creditum est\"). For,  after the death of Mohammed there immediately arose a division which none  of the leading personalities were able to escape, and the opponents spared  each other no possible kind of insult, scorn, or calumny. The enemies of  the first leaders of the community could have wished for no more powerful  weapon for their attack than a well-founded accusation of falsifying the  word of God. Yet this accusation was never brought against the first  collectors of the scattered revelations; the only reproach that was made  against them in connexion with this labour being that verses in which  the Holy Family (Ali and Fatimah) were mentioned with honour, and which,  therefore, would have served to support the claims of the Alids to the  succession of Mohammed, were suppressed by them. This was maintained by the  Shi'ites, who are unsurpassed in Islam as falsifiers of history; and the  passages which, according to them, are omitted from the official Qoran  would involve precisely on account of their reference to the succession,  the mortality of Mohammed.    All sects and parties have the same text of the Qoran. This may have its  errors and defects, but intentional alterations or mutilations of real  importance are not to blame for this.    Now this rich authentic source--this collection of wild, poetic  representations of the Day of judgment; of striving against idolatry; of  stories from Sacred History; of exhortation to the practice of the cardinal  virtues of the Old and New Testament; of precepts to reform the individual,  domestic, and tribal life in the spirit of these virtues; of incantations  and forms of prayer and a hundred things besides--is not always  comprehensible to us. Even for the parts which we do understand, we are not  able to make out the chronological arrangement which is necessary to gain  an insight into Mohammed's personality and work. This is not only due to  the form of the oracles, which purposely differs from the usual tone  of mortals by its unctuousness and rhymed prose, but even more to the  circumstance that all that the hearers could know, is assumed to be known.  So the Qoran is full of references that are enigmatical to us. We therefore  need additional explanation, and this can only be derived from tradition  concerning the circumstances under which each revelation was delivered.    And, truly, the sacred tradition of Islam is not deficient in data of  this sort. In the canonical and half-canonical collections of tradition  concerning what the Prophet has said, done, and omitted to do, in  biographical works, an answer is given to every question which may arise in  the mind of the reader of the Qoran; and there are many Qoran-commentaries,  in which these answers are appended to the verses which they are supposed  to elucidate. Sometimes the explanations appear to us, even at first sight,  improbable and unacceptable; sometimes they contradict each other; a good  many seem quite reasonable.    The critical biographers of Mohammed have therefore begun their work of  sifting by eliminating the improbable and by choosing between contradictory  data by means of critical comparison. Here the gradually increasing  knowledge of the spirit of the different parties in Islam was an important  aid, as of course each group represented the facts in the way which best  served their own purposes.    However cautiously and acutely Weil and his successors have proceeded, the  continual progress of the analysis of the legislative as well as of the  historical tradition of Islam since 1870 has necessitated a renewed  investigation. In the first place it has become ever more evident that the  thousands of traditions about Mohammed, which, together with the Qoran,  form the foundation upon which the doctrine and life of the community  are based, are for the most part the conventional expression of all the  opinions which prevailed amongst his followers during the first three  centuries after the Hijrah. The fiction originated a long time after  Mohammed's death; during the turbulent period of the great conquests there  was no leisure for such work. Our own conventional insincerities differ so  much--externally at least--from those of that date, that it is difficult  for us to realize a spiritual atmosphere where \"pious fraud\" was practised  on such a scale. Yet this is literally true: in the first centuries of  Islam no one could have dreamt of any other way of gaining acceptance for a  doctrine or a precept than by circulating a tradition, according to which  Mohammed had preached the doctrine or dictated it or had lived according to  the precept. The whole individual, domestic, social, and political life  as it developed in the three centuries during which the simple Arabian  religion was adjusted to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#3)"],[1,"at the end of August. While the Kaiser  was sending peaceful telegrams to Petrograd and Vienna, the Press was  full of horrible pictures of Cossack barbarism and the dread terrors of  the Russian knout, both of which--the public was led to believe--were  about to strike Germany.    In this manner the Kaiser and his advisers created a national psychology  which left open only two alternatives: the absolute humiliation of  Russia and the consequent hegemony of Germany in Europe--or war.          CHAPTER II    ON THE LEASH      Russia gave the world to understand by an official declaration, issued  on Friday, July 24th, 1914, that she was not an indifferent, but a  keenly interested spectator to the Austro-Serbian conflict. On the  following day Russia's declaration was published in almost the entire  German Press, and from that moment the same Press was flooded with all  kinds of attacks directed against the Eastern neighbour. Russia was  frankly told to mind her own business--the quarrel did not concern her.    The German public immediately accepted this point of view, so that every  subsequent move on Russia's part appeared in the light of an  unwarrantable offensive. Undoubtedly the Bismarckian tactics of  publishing inspired articles in all parts of Germany were employed, and  their colouring left no doubt on the public mind that the much-talked-of  Slavonic danger had assumed an acute form.    A request on Russia's part, made on July 25th, that the space of time  (forty-eight hours) allowed to Serbia for an answer should be extended,  only increased popular irritation in the Germanic Empires. This  irritation was accompanied by an unmistakable bellicose spirit which  called forth its natural counterpart in Petrograd.    Nevertheless the fact remains that up till July 25th Russia had only  asked for time, and the reply given by the Berlin mob (?) during the  following night, was echoed throughout Germany. The view that Russia had  no right to interest herself on behalf of Serbia (passing over Russia's  right to preserve the newly-established balance of power in the Balkans)  is untenable. If Canada had a quarrel--just or unjust--with the United  States, it would be ridiculous to assert that England had no right to  intervene.    This was, however, not the first occasion on which Germany had advanced  so preposterous a claim. During the tariff conflict between Germany and  Canada some years ago, a wave of indignant anger went over the whole  Fatherland, because England ventured to interfere.    In any case, during the last week before war broke out, the German  Government succeeded in imposing upon public opinion the feeling that  the quarrel was a racial one; together with the conviction that Russia  was interfering in order to protect a band of murderers from just  punishment, and had neither rights nor interests at stake in the  quarrel. This conspiracy succeeded, but the whole German nation must  still be held responsible for the outbreak of war, because, as has been  shown in the preceding chapter, the nation had already been warned by  newspapers of various political parties. They had been plainly told that  Austria had exceeded the limits of all diplomatic dealings between two  sovereign States, and that Austria's provocation could easily kindle a  world war.    Warnings and truths were alike forgotten, and the voices which uttered  them were now raising another hue and cry.[1] Racial hatred was ablaze;  the warlike instincts of a military people were calling for action, and  a diseased conception of national honour was asking why Berlin did not  act against the Russian barbarians. In one paper the author remembers  reading a violent demand for action against Russia before the national  ardour had time to cool down.    [Footnote 1: The last mention of Austria as the guilty party is the  account of the Social Democratic demonstrations in Berlin on July 28th;  reported in the papers of the following day.]    On July 26th Austrian mobilization was in full swing, and Russia  admittedly took precautions of a similar nature soon after that date. We  may be sure that Russia understands her neighbours better than the  inhabitants of the British Isles understand them. In 1909 she had  suffered a severe diplomatic defeat and corresponding loss of prestige,  because she could only use words in dealing with Germany and Austria.[2]  Now she was faced with the alternative of withdrawing from her declared  attitude (July 24th) or taking measures of a military character. In  order not to sacrifice her position as a European power and her special  position as the leader of the Slavonic peoples, Russia chose the latter  course, the only honourable one open to her. German papers and public  speakers retorted that Russia is the patron and protector of  assassins--a calculated distortion of the facts intended to have due  effect on public opinion. On all sides it was said that Russia had given  Serbia secret assurances of help which caused her to become stiff-backed  and unrepentant. Fortunately, it is possible to refute the accusation  through the pen of a German journalist, who described Belgrade's  desperate position on July 25th, the day when the ultimatum expired.    [Footnote 2: \"The interests of Russian and German imperialism have  continually clashed during the last ten years, and more than once Russia  has had to beat a retreat before Germany's threats.\" Dr. Paul Lensch,  member of the Reichstag, in his \"German Social Democracy and the World  War,\" p. 35. Published by \"Vorwaerts Co.\" Berlin, 1915.]    \"At last the inhabitants of Belgrade have become aware of their serious  situation. 'We are lost! Russia has left us in the lurch!' is being  shouted in the streets. Journalists, who at 2.30 p.m. had assured me  that Russia had intervened in Vienna with success, succumbed now to the  general depression. The people believe that they have been betrayed and  sold; rumours of assassination pass from mouth to mouth. The ministerial  council has been characterized by violent recriminations, ending in  blows. Others asserted that the Crown Prince Alexander had been stabbed  by a leader of the war-party. Another whispers that King Peter is dying  from an apoplectic fit or as the result of an _attentat_. The reports  become wilder, and each increases the dread of some unutterable,  imminent catastrophe.    \"The streets are crowded with terror-stricken citizens. Curses resound  on all sides. Certainly a most unusual struggle is going on between the  two parties for peace and war. Shortly after three o'clock it seems to  be settled that Austria's demands will be fulfilled. It is true the  mobilization decree has been posted up on all public buildings, but that  means nothing. We still have nearly three hours in which all can be  righted. How will this gallows-respite be employed?    \"It is four o'clock. Messengers rush from one Embassy to the other. In  the coffee-houses the rumour goes round: 'Italy is our saviour in  distress.' Cries of 'shame!' against Russia are raised, while the  '_vivas_!' for Italy sound louder and louder. The crowd marches to the  Italian Embassy, but are received with long and astonished faces. No!  there is nothing to hope for from Italy. Next they go to the French  Embassy; now there are about two thousand of us. Another disappointment!  A young diplomat receives the thronging masses and talks empty nothings,  including a great deal about France's sympathy for Serbia. But in this  dark hour sympathy is of no avail. Downcast and silent, the people go  next to the representative of Albion--who declines to appear.    \"The confusion in the minds of the masses caused by the Government's  indecision increases from minute to minute; indescribable scenes are  witnessed before the General Post Office. It is alleged that thousands  and thousands of telegrams have arrived from Russia, begging the members  of Serbia's royal family not to give way to Austria. It may easily be  possible that the Russian telegrams all emanate from one person and have  been forged, in order to counteract the disposition to yield on the part  of the royal family. Without doubt both the King and Crown Prince have  lost all personal influence on the final decision. They are being slowly  carried along by the conflagration-party which obtained the upper hand  soon after four o'clock.\"[3]    [Footnote 3: _Muenchen-Augsburger Abendzeitung_, July 28th.]    This picture gives no support to Germany's accusation that Russia had  stiffened Serbia into resisting Austria's unacceptable demands. It  rather leads one to consider that an action which drives a weak nation  to arrive at a decision on so awful an issue in so short a time, is an  action discreditable to a stronger, and impossible on the part of a  morally great, power. If Serbia chose wrongly in refusing to bite the  dust, then the guilt is still chargeable to Austria for forcing her  little neighbour to take a choice in haste. Sir Edward Grey emphasized  in his speech of July 27th the shortness of the time which all the  Powers had had at their disposal to formulate a plan, by which the  conflict could be restricted to the East, or amicably settled.    The leaders of the Germanic States had purposely willed it so. Several  unsuccessful attempts had been made to break up the Triple Entente, the  only barrier to the Germanization, _i.e._, Prussianization, of Europe,  and in the tragedy of Serajewo the Central Powers (or, at least, the  dominating factor of the two) believed they had found a lever with which  to break down the opposition by diplomacy. If that failed an immediate  appeal to the sword should follow. The diplomatic forty-eight hours'  _coup-de-main_ failed, and the programme contained no other item except  war. In a few words this means that the dastardly crime of Princip and  his fellow conspirators was exploited by Germany, acting through  Austria, to disturb"]]]
